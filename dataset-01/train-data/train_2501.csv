4,Hawthorne on Painting,"Good book, focuses on color. Read it for my Painting 1 Class and it is pretty beneficial but a short quick book."
3,Needs examples of his art,"Would gladly have paid more to see examples . While the statements are fascinating I needed to see more of what he did , not just what was on the cover."
4,"Spots, spots and more spots!","While this tiny book does offer some important truths, it could be made even smaller if the author's central theme of color ""spots"" was not on nearly every single page.My only other complaint is about that the reviews of students' paintings which comprises a large part of this small work. They are not nearly as helpful as they would be if there was some attempt at describing them a little more thoroughly than ""Model in red sweater."" (There are no graphics of any type in the entire book.)Still, there is enough truth in this booklet to make it a must if you paint in anything approaching a representational style, (or want to)."
3,Amazing artist,"It's a good to hear the comments from this wonderful artist expressing what makes an artist. The books modest cost is worth it, just to feel how he processes the visual world. His constructive reviews of students is enlightening. What I really missed was pictures of the works he is reviewing. The book is devoid of any pictures. You have to visualize what he is talking about. I really wanted to ""see"" what he was seeing."
1,"Cut short, too","My DVD shows the same problem: part 4 (""An emotional reunion"") is lacking, and a DVD containing only 21 minutes is no good value. Pity, because the whole broadcast was really moving."
3,Collar strap,Couldn't use this product for what I needed it for. But is a good product for what it is.
5,safe and strong,collars are extra long but have plenty of holes for ajustment and can be easily be cut with a hot knife to fit your dog. I now have these collars on all my dogs which range from a minnie doxxy to a boxer!
4,works,works good as a replacement to the one my boxer somehow got off his neck and chewed into about 9 pieces. good durability for the price.
2,BROKE AFTER 2 DAYS,"ITEM VERY CHEAP, RING BROKE AFTER 2 DAYS ON MY CANE CORSO MATERIAL THIN AND FLIMSY.ONLY PLUS IS THAT IT WAS WATERPROOF"
3,"1"" Black Collar Strap","I wasn't sure how to rate this. The product was of high quality, but it was too wide for the Field Trainer system that advertised it. So I ended up returning it for a refund, and am disappointed that it was advertised on a system that it didn't fit. That cost me shipping and handling both ways, which was as much as the collar."
1,"Pay more, buy it once!","Bought this baby for $66 at tool king. First thing I saw I noted, ""made in taiwan"". Oh well there's not that much to it, gave it a shot. First one I got home leaked from the center white plastic cap which isn't removable so there is nothing I could do with it. Took it back and swapped it for a 2nd attempt. Didn't leak as much, but still leaks from same place. What a pain! Will take that back and get a refund."
3,Poor,What lured me is the fact that theres 15 of the screen guards. However they are very poorly crafted. I wish I had purchased a single better quality screen guard.
5,What you need to install these risers on your BMW,"The whole change out took me about 20 minutes after I found the information I am sharing here. You will need a torque wrench. The torque for the bolts is 19 Nm, which is 14 Ft Lbs., or 168 Inch Pounds. I installed these on my 2006 R1200RT BMW and they fit perfectly. I needed a T-45 torx for the factory bolts and the bolts which came with the risers required a 6mm hex. To insure the bolts will not seize, I put never-seize on all bolts. The risers installed easily. The existing bolts will be reused which now hold your handlebars in place. As for how well they work, I will have to come back for that, as I am reporting this prior to my test ride."
1,Not edible!,"I see this item is no longer available thru Amazon but it is on the Robscape website.I ordered a case of the 6oz bags and although I never had them before, I had ordered them for a friend, I was curious to see what they tasted like when they arrived. They were awful, obviously stale.I could not pass these on to my friend and I figured I was out the money. After contacting Amazon via phone, the representative was as sweet and understanding as could be and I told her I contacted the manufacturer to complain. Amazon refunded my money completely, no return necessary of the merchandise, and as usual, my confidence in the high level of customer service from Amazon continues! Don't know whose fault it was that the chips were tainted tasting but regardless, Amazon compensated me and I am very happy."
5,"Stunning, awsome, must see","These DVDs are the most fascinating trip around Creation you will ever have. Frankly, if you don't believe God is the Creator, you will after viewing these DVDs. They show how everything works together perfectly, only possible with the Creator's hand. The photography is breathtaking and the music is beautiful. The information in the DVDs comes from experts in the various fields that will capture your attention and imagination. They will appeal to teenagers to senior adults - my mother has a set she has enjoyed numerous times. These DVDs are something you will watch over and over because there is so much information and beauty packed in each one."
5,you won't be disappointed,"This is a great deal for your money. Though the videos may be a touch dated, they are done extremely well and the information is still shocking. My wife and I found ourselves continually saying, ""That is incredible, simply incredible!""Watch this with your kids to really introduce them to God's wonderful brilliance in the world."
3,The series was WAY outdated!,"Good material but it was advertised as a good product. It worked, however this product should be discontinued as it is a poor representation of the Christian faith and amazing things God has done!I want to point out that this footage seemed to be shot in the late 80's or early 90's. Very fuzzy footage!"
3,A Quality Review Book,"This book was one of my many test prep books for AP Biology. Its strengths and its weaknesses lie in its conciseness. The subject reviews are very brief and would probably not be helpful in teaching you the material; however, if you are using the book as a review tool, it is perfect. The subject reviews always stayed on topic and contained just the right amount of detail for the AP test. It also contained a review of the 12 labs of the AP Biology course, which are a big part of the exam. My biggest complaint is that there was only one full practice test, and there were very few practice quizzes throughout the book. This is where it falls behind the other AP Bio test preps. But for a quick (last-minute) review, this book is definitely your best bet."
5,Fabulous tool for review and study!!,This book was one of the best study tools I have ever found. It gives the needed information in a context that is at once simple and complete. I recommend it for any who are taking the AP Biology course.
1,way too salty,"Tthis is an *extremely* salty product, which is too bad because the flavor and crunch are otherwise quite good.Grease is another issue. the chips don't look greasy, but if you forget to wipe your hands each time, your keyboard/clothes *will* get grease marks."
2,Veggie Chips,I was a little disappointed in these chips. The flavor is okay and the crunchiness is nice but I didn't care for the oiliness left on my fingers. I'll look for a different flavor or brand next time.
1,Chips?,"Very disappointed, not nearly as good as others I've had. Plus, they were ""nuggets"", not ""chips"". We have a family of five and gave the whole box away. Don't know if anyone ever ate them."
1,could have been a 5 star,"I recieved these too close to their expiration date to review the taste... mine tasted a mixture of stale and plastic. I contacted both Robert's and Amazon who were both very helpful and I got an exhcange. Based on my family's enjoyment of the ""Veggie Booty"" and the ""Smart Puffs"" (the best!) I say the ""Veggie Chips"" had great potential:) Just hope to get some that aren't stored in too much heat and too close to the expiration date since there are no presevatives it will shorten the life!!"
2,I found it boring,"There was no description of the book when I bought it, so I did not realize that it was a dry technical read. It is not for the creative person, and offers little to nothing on the how to make dynamic layered audio in post. It's about notch filters, and VITC timecode. Very techincal, very non-creative. Maybe that's the point, but is wasn't for me."
3,Wire twister pliers works stiffly,"The pliers is as advertised, but the twisting mechanism does not work smoothly. It is functional, but does not work as well as I expected."
1,this knives can't cut air,sharpless knives ever. what a shame on seller! very dissappointed.I only use them to spread peanut butter and jelly or icing on cake. Useless as a knife.
1,"Run, don't walk, away from this","""Seventies Soul Sensations"" is 98% re-records and live versions. The Only original here is ""Show and Tell"".A complete and utter rip-off."
2,Disappointed,"This book does not give any method for controling or preventing tantrums. It suggest things to try that we all know already from parenting magazines or friends. Such as holding your child during the tantrum & telling them that you're there for them. But, then the book jumps to saying that you should ignore your child, such as turning your back or leaving the room.If you're a new parent & are looking for several different suggestions you might like the book. However, if you are hoping for a book that outlines a method or steps to try this book will NOT help."
1,18 minutes of nothing,The whole DVD is basically a 18-minutes long footage of a signing session; completely non-edited and non-informative. The picture quality is like of an 80-ies cheap home video camera.
3,Smoothed out!,"After reading about the myriad ways of ""smoothing up the boundary"" presented in a lucid, user-friendly and even intimate manner, I decided to put a few of them to the practical test. The boundaries we as a society find in eveyday life are usually found to be rife with roughness, tending even to chafe at our tender skin. Oh, the nights I've tossed and turned at night aching for a kind of Psychic Sandpaper, if you will. ..................................................................................................For if we are to accept this book's basic axiom, namely that there are indeed Boundaries, then who would disagree that it would be far more pleasurable to have boundaries that we would physically enjoy brushing up against, or perhaps pressing our faces to."
4,Excellent Watch,"The red dial and polished stainless case make this a very attractive watch, and the price makes it even more so. However, I do have a couple negative comments.1. The numbers/letters on the date/hour/day dials are too small. In bright light they're readable, but barely.2. I found it almost impossible to remove the screws necessary to remove links, even with a set of jeweler's screw drivers. I finally gave up, took the whole bracelet off and replaced it with a dark brown leather strap. It makes the watch even more attractive.3. The instructions are a waste of paper. Fortunately, it's not to difficult to figure out."
2,Thumbs down,"I've now had this watch for about a year, & would like to suggest others to avoid it. From day one, out of the box, the item could not keep the correct date! I could have had this serviced from Invicta, but that would have cost the rip-off free of $20 in S&H;! Yes, they charge a flat fee of $20 in S&H; to ship your watch back to you. Considering $20 is around 30% of how much I paid for the item, that seems ridiculous.Over the past few months, the glass covering the watch face has cracked, big time, and has a huge streak on it. I've had cheap $5/$10 watches that have never done this, yet this expensive watch did it?While this watch looks great in person, it's not worth the potential headaches it might give you. My verdict - avoid!"
3,Invicta II,"I thought the watch was worth the money, but the day of the week and date of the month are simply too small to read."
3,Invicta mens watch,Very nice watch. But needed a jeweler to shrink the watch band. $10.00 fee for that. Intructions supplied with watch are not adequate to change settings or battery.
1,"Watch does not work, the watch band is too big..no wrist measurements requested at purchase","Don't even think of buying this watch. The watch bands are for giants, the watch has many many unecessary features that do not work at all. The whole thing is Chinese made, not just the box it comes in, which is actually better than this watch.Stick to Timex(even the Chinese version) at 11.95 and forget this."
3,Difficult to size,"I live in Chattanooga, TN and was very disappointed that there was not an ""elite retailer"" listing on the Invicta website where I could get the watch sized. I called around to a couple of jewelers in town and they do not carry the watch. They suggested I go to a nondescript watch repair place to get it done."
5,Looks better than the picture!,This is an awesome watch. I love the style and durability. The picture does not do it justice. I would highly recomend this fashionable watch I received at a great price. People will notice it! The only negative aspect is the button used to change the day of month gets pushed by pressing against my hand at least once every three days (I am hoping there is a way to lock the button).
5,"""I am not a man of the center. I am from somewhere else.""","Bowden's prose is actually a long tone poem, and if you read it this way, you will not be disappointed. The mesquite is the metaphor: once you read it, you'll understand, and you'll want to read more. Bowden is one of our most brutally honest writers practicing the trade today, but he writes with velvet gloves. He teaches us how to rejoice in our despair--he's a practicing buddhist, he just doesn't know it.If you are new to Bowden's writing, this book is as good a place to start as any. For a man who has probably seen and witnessed the worst we can do to each other, he somehow holds out hope for the best. What else can we do but sink our taproots and satisfy our appetites?---at least that is something, as Bowden says..."
2,"Two stars for good writing, but","who wants to be in this guy's head for a whole book? There isn't much of a thread throughout, just the author's musings. He's a man of a certain generation and will probably appeal to the same. He's mournful, self-absorbed, ranting about things he has no intention of doing anything about -- it used to be attractive to be the bad boy complaining about society, but hey, we've heard it a zillion times. Now do something, share some great idea about how to change things. This is just another lament. You'll like it if you like that. I'm ready to move on."
4,Hurts my ears,I bought this particular product because I don't use contacts but still need my glasses while working. These get a bit painful on my ears after sometime but are otherwise ok.
5,"Excellent Safety Shields, Fits Over Glasses","I was worried that for the price, I would be getting a flimsy product. Not true. I was tired of my unnecessary and painful splash goggles in the lab, but worried that these would not fit over my glasses or cover enough of my face to shield it properly. That is not so, these fit over my clunky glasses very well and provide more than adequate coverage without looking stupid! Better yet, these have not scratched yet and I mishandle everything!"
5,great over glasses,bought these because I needed an inexpensive safety goggles for chemistry but I don't like the feel and strap of the goggles. this safety glasses fits perfectly over prescription glasses and mine don't have any scratches on them yet. overall it works and very affordable
5,They do the Job.,"These are great if you take care of them. Very nice when new, but scratch if you are not careful with them."
5,great,"Ordered one to try and now put a new order for 3 more, they are excellent, used them to work on fairing and sanding a ceiling with dust just pouring on my face and my eyes were fully protected, as well another project working with power sanders.The material is cristal clear,and closes fairly well around my eyeglass,have tried other over time and none as comfortable and safe as this model so ordered a few more as I know how difficult is to find one that will work for me and at this price."
2,"Glasses work fine, but not as advertised","I bought mine from a seller called California Tools. They were advertised to meet ANSI Z87.1 standards, but when I got them, there is absolutely no markings saying that they meet that code. Most glasses of this style have the marking on right behind the vents, but there is absolutely no markings at all on the glasses, making me believe that the glasses I got are a cheap imitation of the MSA glasses"
4,Fits over my glasses,"I've been needing safety goggles that could fit over my glasses for when I have to work in the woodshop and these work alright. They cover half of my face, but that's ok, even preferable. they aren't all too comfortable to wear with glasses on, but you can't expect the utmost comfort when you're wearing 2 pairs of glasses. The price is good and they'll do their job, that's what's important."
3,Work well enough,"Seems to protect my eyes well. Have not broken. However, I did see similar ones for less after I bought these."
1,The author's worst book,"I've read everything Mr. McCammon was written and enjoyed most of it, but this was the exception. I can't think of a single thing I liked about it. It was boring, the characters uninteresting and Baal just didn't cut it for me. Considering that the Hebrew God drove him out of Palistine, I found it strange that he'd show up in a country where He is worshiped. I would have thought he'd go somewhere where another diety was followed.This was the first book Mr. McCammon wrote, but it was not the first one I read. If I had started with this one, instead of the much superiour ""They Thirst"", I'd have probably never picked him up again. Leave this one on the shelf"
3,WELL WRITTEN BUT ORDINARY GOOD VERSUS EVIL NOVEL,"AFTER HAVING READ SWAN SONG, A BOYS LIFE AND GOIN SOUTH' I WAS DISAAPOINTED WITH THIS BOOK. I EXPECTED MORE OF AN INVOLVED TALE. ALTHOUGH WELL WRITTEN, THERE IS LITTLE SUBSTANCE AND JUST AN AVERAGE READ."
4,"""Mcammon does it again!!""","I started reading Robert R. Mcammon, with the short story collection, ""Blue World"". I loved that so moved on to his other works, and AM VERY DISAPPOINTED to learn that he's supposedly stopped writing horror. Anyway, ""Baal"" is a classic horror novel. Anytime a novel or movie stays with me, I know it's done it's job. It's entertained me and become part of what I like about reading. That is the STIMULATION of IMAGINATION. Well, the Dracula-esque ending, and shear terror and disturbing quality of this novel, makes it a true KING fan's honorary favorite of Mcammon's books. If you like this one I ALSO RECOMMEND ""SWAN SONG"" AND ""BLUE WORLD"", also by McCammon"
5,"""THE BEST HORROR AUTHOR OF THE DECADE.""","""Baal"" one of McCammon's best books. Pure horror and suspense. It's a book easy to read and to understand. It really get's your attention to it. It's pure evil. Fantastic.Claudia Cox"
1,Trailer hitch Valley,This Item Was received bent and did not appear damaged in shipping. Money was gladly refunded and a better price was gotten local at U-haul.
5,Architectural Acoustics (Applications of Modern Acoustics),"THE book on acoustics for non-acousticians. Comprehensive,concise, and completely accessible for anyone with an interest in acoustics. THE ""go to"" text for audio engineers, sound designers, and musicians who want to better understand the physical world that directly effects their art."
3,Not durable enough,"I bought this for my 3 year old who loves bull riding. It is not a very durable set for young children. The clips used to hold the fence and gates kept coming apart. I ended up buying the plastic connectors that electricians used to ""tie"" wires together. Our son loves it now that it stays together, but we can not change the layout at all without scissors and new ties. He does love all the extras like clown, barrel and hats so he can play out what he sees on tv."
2,Rodeo Champions Deluxe Set,"I rated the set a two because one of the two cardboard parts was missing and the included cardboard part had a missing tab. I was disappointed in the low articulation of the bulls. I felt it did not live up to the advertising of how much the bulls could be posed. I plan to display the set in an aquarium (without water, of course) and I am disappointed in the limitation of ""the bull action"" available."
1,Awful - just awful,"THIS HAS TO BE THE MOST AWFUL ""BOOK"" ON MS. GARBO I HAVE EVER READ. THERE ARE SO MANY BLATANT LIES, ERRORS, MISTAKES, MIS-CAPTIONED PHOTOS, ETC. THAT I WOULD NOT KNOW WHERE TO BEGIN TO STATE THEM. I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER SEEN SUCH POOR RESEARCH!I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN - NEVER DID THIS AUTHOR WRITE ANYTHING CREDIBLE. HE NEVER WROTE ANYTHING OF MERIT IN HIS LIFE.TRUE ADMIRERS OF MS. GARBO--PLEASE--READ KAREN SWENSON'S EXCELLENT BIOGRAPHY ""GARBO - A LIFE APART"". THIS IS SUPERB IN EVERY WAY - TRUTH, RESEARCH, INSIGHT, LIFE STORY, LOVE FOR JOHN GILBERT, SCANDANAVIAN ANGLE, ETC., ETC.PLEASE - READ THIS EXCELLENT BIOGRAPHY OF THIS EXQUISITE, UNIQUE ACTRESS - ONE WE WILL NEVER SEE THE LIKES OF AGAIN!"
5,"Slow Song in ""Just My Luck""","Hey Emmanuel, the song is by Röyksopp called ""Only This Moment"" -- FYI, the whole album is excellent. - Phil"
5,Very Satisfied,"My friends had talked about McFly for quite some time. I decided to go out and buy this CD. Man, was I in for a treat!McFly is a great sounding band. They bring a mix of The Beatles and The Beach Boys. Their songs make you want to get up and dance. I purchased this on the day it came out and have yet to be able to take it out! All of their songs are so catchy.So... Buy this CD! You won't be disappointed! Plus, they're starting to get big! Be the first out of your friends to know of McFly!"
4,"how I enjoyed reading this book,Mattimeo","Mattimeo is one of the coolest book in the Redwall series. My favorite Characters are Matthias, Slagar, Log-a-Log, Basil Stag Hare and Cheek. I recommend this book to all Redwall fans that havn't read this book."
4,"Help, I'm addicted to these @#$%@ Redwall books!","While the overly-cute baby animal dialogues, not to mention the endless descriptions of their food, sometimes get on my nerves, these Redwall novels really have me hooked! I've read them all --- every single one of them! Brian Jacques has an excellent imagination, and his stories really do make me interested in what's going on! This is the first one to include a major battle between good and evil armies, but I've noticed that bloodshed is a common occurence in these otherwise very gentle little animal stories."
4,the long patrol,I think this book is very interesting. I had a tense feeling in my stomach while Tammo and Midge were escaping from the Rapscallion Army while being chased by Rinkul and his gang! A very exiting book. I highly recomend it.
4,The Long Patrol,The Long Patrol was a very exciting book. I thought it was intresting because all the animals talk. Its strange the way the author made the animal's lives like ours(without modern technology). The beggining is a bit confusing because theres about four different settings and they keep skipping back and forth. Near the end it makes a lot more sense. I would probably recommend this book to teenagers or older people. Its hard to read because the animals talk in old English.
3,All the same,"I loved the first redwall book but then i went on with the series, and every book is the same story. Even the little details like bloodwrath badger lords always dreaming about a villian and a young mouse, hare, etc. that is becoming a warrior. Although I'd give this about 4 stars, it was to familiar a story. They added in Camp Tussick, the little ridge, and the whole long patrol in its self. Once again the bloodwrath came back in, and the young hero, and all the riddles and songs. Otherwise it was nearly as good as the first book."
5,I love it !!!!!!!!,I like this book because it spent more time on other charactors like salamandastron hares. It also had excellent detail and a great setting.
5,The Long Patrol is a favourite of mine(as well as the rest),"The Long Patrol is part of the Redwall tradition, they keep getting better. I have read the all the Redwall books in the series(Excluding Marlfox, which I just ordered)from 2 to 6 times. Tammo and the rest of the Long Patrol are more perilous than ever, and Creega was an interesting addition to a long line of bloodwrath filled badgers. I am anxious to see if Marlfox includes more about russano the wise. Eulaliaaaaaaa! for the Long Patrol and Brian Jacques!!!!!"
5,Jacques' latest is a true example of his talent.,"The Long Patrol, the latest in Brian Jacques' Redwall series, is another example of Jacques' wonderfull aptitude for storytelling. It is a light-hearted book that is easy to read and enjoy. First time Jacques readers or avid Redwall fans will appreciate this wonderfull story. The adventures of the young hare Tammo(along with many others) are told in this book. Every page will hold the reader's interest in some unique way. Pick up a copy of The Long Patrol today and enjoy emmersing yourself into Brian Jacques' agical world where the animals walk on two feet, where every detail is brilliantly described, and where the war between good and evil rages on. The Long Patrol is a winner!"
3,Refreshing but just a little hint of matthias...,"The long pattrol was well writen but i must say there was a bit of ""redwall"" in it . For instance , Tamello , the lead also the unsuspecting hero of the story was pretty much a draged out matthias ( if you remember in the begging of redwall mathias was hardly you hero type much like this lad ) but i will give credit where credit is do , it was a refreshinly new story line unlike the first three books which pretty much kept the plot changed the era and charictar names and swapped subplots . but really if your in the mood for a warm story about mice and danger then this is worth it despite my ranting and ravings"
5,GREAT!,"I thought this book was great,though the plot seemed a little less fuller than the other books. I think that Midge Manycoats shoud have died, to surprise the reader, but overall I liked this book and you should read it."
3,Dissapointing,"I never really liked the badger lords and hares and in this book they were too ""perilous"" It was one of the good-bad books in the series but some parts were good and realistic. I guess I recomend it to other readers but it is kind of a dissapointment to longtime Redwall fans."
2,Totally disappointing,"The first eight Redwall books were all equally good -- there was never a decline; all of them explored something new and were exciting, well-written. But then this book came -- the pits.Brian Jacques has hit an unprecedented low! Most of the writing is a shameful copy of his former work. The villians are neither new nor interesting. The battles, the plot, the conversations between the Redwallers, all are as stale as the South Wall.Remember -- all of the previous 8 books were terrific. Brian Jacques is a terrific writer, but here he has simply blown it."
3,could be better,"I believe this book had good ideas but no character development and the end battle was too short. But still I say that if you like Redwall books you might enjoy it even though it was a bit shallow. I would not recommend this book to anyone just starting the Redwall series because it is towards the end of the series.After reading this book my first reaction was Jacques just wanted to get the story done with. Even with these short comings it followed Jacques's style of writing which can absorb and please any reader, no matter how little detail."
1,"BJ? Trust me, you can do better.","The Long Patrol sucks. Those four words you have never heard out of the mouth of any true Redwall fan. Well, you're gonna hear it from me. TLP was just put out on the market to keep Brian Jacques's fans happy 'til the next book. I hated it. It revolved around fight after fight where the good guys always won even though they were outnumbered. Now, the bad guys on the other hand, were so terrifying and feared... but so disorganized and stupid they hardly made a threat. Now, look at Redwall. The first book. Cluny made it /in/ to Redwall. He could have /won/ if it weren't for Matthias. But these horrible rapscallions weren't even worth the effort to turn the page. I would not reccomend this to someone new to the world of Redwall. Read Martin The Warrior."
4,Wonderful!,"This was a wonderful edition tothe Redwall saga. Its continuing characters from Pearls of Lutra brightened it up and the hares of the Long Patrol are sure ""perilous"""
4,One of the better books in the Redwall series.,"In the series it is probably #5 out of the ten books. Though it is a good book it is certainly worth reding but, not the best book he has ever written."
5,Jacques is on a roll with the Long Patrol,I have only begun to read this book but almost instantly I was hooked. This book as in all of his books is great. I have read all of his books at least twice. They are a great read and are easily read. Jacques's style of writing is so enticing that his books are readable at all levels. I strongly suggest you read this book and all of his others they will keep you hooked for sure.
4,"Good, but not as good as B.J. can do...","The Long Patrol is B.J.'s 10th book. I'm halfway through reading it, and it's not as good as one would imangine it. The charaters (the hares), are so varied in personatily that it is hard to follow, and the vermin are rather dull. I love the Redwall series, but this is a little dissapointing..."
5,the best redwall book,"Even though Brian Jaques has already written two more books, I still think this is the best. I ALWAYS cry when that one hare dies. I'm not saying his name for the people who havn't read this yet. for the people who have, you know who I'm talking about right? It is such a wonderful book. And SOOOOOOOOOO exciting! I love it! You HAVE to read this!"
4,Not for new Redwallers.,"I liked this, buut this was veeerrryy much like Redwall, where poor, blundering Matthias ends up being the hero. Poor, inexperienced Tammello de Fformelo Tussock, runs away and ends up a hero. And the same, disguised plot! I'm getting sick of it. Some vermin attack. Redwall gets its silly self into trouble. A woodland hero saves the day. And I hate why two guys were killed for nothing. And I began to roll my eyes at the chants about how perilous the hares were. Why didn't we hear about that in Salamandastron? And why don't the Redwall warriors have training? They still fight as well as the hares! Yes, and this book is very much dependent on the previous books. This is not for new Redwallers."
4,Awesome,"Let me just say that this book is awesome. But, it would have been a better fantasy if it had some magic and wizardry in it! That would have made this book a lot cooler."
5,Jolly good!,"I love the Redwall series, and I mean that I love every book in it. This one, however, is my favorite. I think that the hares are my favorite group of characaters in Jacques' books and since this book centered around the elite fighting unit known as The Long Patrol, it makes sense that this is my favorite. You can't help but fall in love with Tammo and Russa as they make their way to Redwall and it's famed fare. And Damug Warfang is one of those villains that you just love to hate. Redwall fan or not, this book is totally great!"
4,The Long Patrol,"The books in the series of Redwall are wonderful.The Long Patrol is one of my favorites its got action,adventure,and all the other things you could want in a book.Amazing character expression makes you feel like you're in the book as the perilous unit of long patrol hares sets out to rid Mossflower of Damug Warfang's Rapscallion army in one of the biggest battles Redwall has ever faced. As they go many are lost many are gained. A young hare,Tammo, goes through many hardships as he becomes one of the greatest Long Patrol hares of all time.Being 11 I love these books and would classify this as one of the best books I've ever read.I encourage everyone to read these books."
2,Cliched Venetian Art Caper,"Jordan Brooks, a scholar/art dealer with a checkered past arrives in Venice along with an array of tony international art dealers. The lure - the surfacing of the Leopardi Madonna, a Raphael masterpiece stolen from an Italian Jew by the Nazis and supposedly destroyed during Allied bombing. Is it a fake or the genuine article? Dealers start disappearing and dying. Who will emerge victorious with the prize Leopardi Madonna? Filled with cliches including Jordan's romance with a sexy and smart woman half his age, and a hundred pages too long this is a mildly entertaining novel with a plot that's been done many times before. It's for those who enjoy stories that take place in Venice as the author handles the atmospherics well."
4,Excellent book - but I COULD be biased,"After having this book recommended to me by a friend, I was amazed at the book's artistic sophistication - of course, the art books layering the coffee table at their house and the various art pieces around the house DID lead me to believe he was in fact a conossieur of art. this book is excellent - I would recommend it to ANYONE looking for a good historical art fiction book :)"
3,Wildgame Cookbook,My sister had this book. So in stead of borrowing it I decided to get my own copy. It has some really good recipes for deer. But it lacks in a lot of other areas. I have seen better wildgame cookbooks. But this book is fine for the reciopes I wanted.
3,misleading,"I thought when the book was advertised as having 500 pages, it sounded impossible. Sure enough it has about 15 pages. I think my grandson will still enjoy it, but why the false advertising?"
4,The Dark Book,This is a book that my class loves to look at. I introduce it when we are studding the solar system. You turn off the lights and read the pages with a flashlight. Then turn off the light and you see the stars. It must be a completly dark room. It teaches about the constalations.
2,baby pony don't come with,"The pony is great except she does not come with the baby pony that is pictured. I had to send it back because, the baby pony was the reason I ordered this pony to begin with. I just wanted to let future buyers know not to expect the baby pony with it."
4,"great pony, but where is that baby?","I got this pony with the baby from my friend, who already had one. She is very pretty, but the packaging, like all the other ponies, is hard to undo for younger children, and scissors may have to be used. I am dissapointed that these ponies don't have babies now."
1,First Book I Actually Didn't Finish Reading,It really surprised me that I was so disapointed in this book that I didn't finish it. The heroine really was annoying! The story was not very well developed and choppy. I enjoy reading romance novels and this is the first one I put down before finishing! :-(
2,Disappointing at best. An eyeroller for sure!,"I picked up this book, hoping for a good story, but I was disappointed. The fact that this woman is transported back in time with no difficulties and fits right in is highly unlikely, especially since she had little or no experience with living outside of the city. She was very selfish, only thinking of her freedom and independence. I wanted to shake her silly! The ending wasn't bad, but it took a lot of eyerolling to get there."
1,no book,i have been waiting for weeks for this book seller does not reply to emails. amazon used to be a great site never again will i order from them
1,Very disappointed. I was sent the instructor version,I was sent the instructor version of the book. There was no information in the vedors book description that it was the instructor version. I complained to the vendor and had to send the book back to get a refund. I ordered another book and checked with the vendor who told me that they were 99% sure it was the student version. When it arrived it was again the instructor version. I did get a refund but I am now stuck without a student version that I can use in my class.It is essential that the book vendor say specifically in the book description information that the book is a student version or an instructor version.
1,More ads then info,The Magazine wasn't worth the wait. This has to be one of Cabela's worst products ever. On 98 percent of every page there is a add.The Journal is so close to a catalog there shouldn't be any charge for it.
3,This grand slam is really only game in 4-hearts.,"Cassandra Swann is worth meeting and this mystery is an excellent introduction. Swann's knowledge of bridge and eternal meddling in the death of Lady Portia Wickham are considerably less impressive than her relationships with what is left of her family and the men in her life. Yet, somehow, Susan Moody has woven the stories together so well that you can't imagine finding out about one without the other. As a heroine, Cassandra Swann is just neurotic enough to be interesting; and good-hearted enough to be endearing"
4,Good product,"What could be better, good product , good price, free shipping. These are made for the shade tree mechanic but lack somewhat in quality control. The support brackets that come with the steps are too light of steel, and are bent the wrong way. 15 minutes on a bench vise bending them correctly and installation is a breeze. I never could figure out why companies sell you a stainless steel product, then give you plain steel hardware to install it. Spend a few x-tra dollars and get stainless hardware. I would definitely purchase again."
4,a total masterpiece!!!,omg! its a great book for all ages. im 15 and i loved it. i never thought i'd like historical fiction until i read this one. thanks for autographing my copy graham!
5,Great book!,I read this book last summer and I thought it was really good! I was almost going to put it down after the 2nd chapter but I told myself to read at least 5 more. And I am so glad that I made my self do that! It was quickly moving and it is a book you will want to read again! I am planning on reading it again this summer. Happy reading!
3,A lively description of the Bulgarian Macedonian struggle,"This is not history, but a rather lively description day to day night to night of the life of the Bulgarian ""Committemen"" struggling to make Macedonia a Bulgarian province. The author takes a very pro-Bulgarian (and anti-Serb and anti-Greek, not to mention anti-Turkish) attitude, which is understandable from the fact that he lives and breaths with Bulgarians while in Macedonia. Arthur Douglas Howden actuallu did what no modern reporter would ever do...he did not simply report on the action...he joined it! He joined a group of Bulgarian ""Komitadji"" starting from Sofia, Bulgaria and crossing into Ottoman-occupied Macedonia. The reading is easy and flows well. The English is very 19th centurish but easily understood. once again...do not expect to learn history from this, but it is a beautifull time capsule of pre-Balkan war eastern Ottoman Macedonia, now part of Easten Macedonia of Greece and SW Bulgaria."
2,PlayStation 2 Wireless 2pk-Chameleon [Pelican],"The Controler is fine but the ""required"" adapters are lame and require you to play with them and position them... just right for a good connection every time you touch your PS2.CH<END>"
4,"Good study of Some Chippewa Living at White Earth in the 1930,s","The person writing this did ok as far as making observations. Her method of choosing the individual households to study was not very scientific. But the result was a snapshot in time of a few families, mostly living in poverty on the White Earth Reservation in the 1930,s."
2,Definitely for the young,I loved the smell of this when i first sprayed it on so i bought a bottle. then after a few minutes of wearing it i noticed a minty smell and was totally turned off by it. i tried to wear it again the next day but it just doesn't do it for me. i'm going to give my bottle away.sandie
5,Perfum perfect for spring and summer,"If you can't wait for summer and need a little pick me up, try this one. It smells just like summer. Make sure you buy a convertible and some sunglasses to go with your new scent!!!"
5,Great Book!,"This is a great book. It changed my life and opened my mind. I had an experience that changed my outlook on life and my consciousness. It is impossible to explain, but I HIGHLY recommend this book if you are looking for the meaning and purpose of life. This book blew my mind, meaning I am a different person now than I was before I read the book. Also recommend, ""Alterations in Consciousness"" by Baruss."
4,Faithful to the book,"This new musical production follows Baum's original book very faithfully. James Doyle's music is delightful. You should also check out his CD ""Before The Rainbow"", an anthology of restored music from early stage versions of OZ."
4,Pretty good book,"This is a fun collection of brain teasers for training your reasoning skills. It is really good at seeing whether you notice the details of sentences... easily half of the puzzles are the sort where your mind skips ahead of the question and you guess wrong at first. There is a lot of word play, and many ""homophone"" sounds alike clues.I like that the answers are not in a block at the end of the book -- they are hidden on the page. Good book!"
3,Not as good as some others.,This one wasn't as good as the total brain work out books. I love puzzle books and things like that. This one was more like a riddle book.
2,word games,"This is 108 pages of mostly word games. They wouldn't work well for parties, but might work with a small dinner group. I didn't find it very fun. The best puzzle is the one on the outside cover. The rest are dull."
2,Not as it seems in the review ....,"I am a huge fan of brain teaser books. I have a huge collection of these types of book. BUT after reading this book I say that this book is not as good as it seems in the review. If you think that you will find many Logical and mathematical riddles, this isn't the book for you, but on the other hand if you are into word games this might be a great book for you ."
3,"Not so fantastic, really...","Jeffrey Reid Baker found the ""bell"" sound on his synthesizer and really, really wants to use it. There's no variety of sound here whatsoever -- just bells, bells, and more bells, with here and there a ""fat"" synthesizer sound. But mostly bells. Call this the ""Fantastic Bells of Christmas."" Such a shame, as his original additions to some of the carols are quite interesting.If you like bells, get it."
3,"Good quality, color brighter than seen on screen","As always, Clarks provides comfort and high quality with this product. However, the color I choose (light brown) is much brighter than seen on the screen."
3,protecting my TX,Not real satisfied with this product. Not handy to use. Protects PDA though but not at all what I expected.
2,"More spice, please...","Even back in the sixties where I suspect this collection is derived, 101 Strings took a backseat to the likes of say, Mantovani. The old Alshire tracks have been transfered to CD with little or no remastering by MADACY. Lucky that I still utilize a 14 band graphic equalizer to cut the shrillness out of the treble and control the rubber band sounding bass. That said, anything remotely Latin is thrown into the program mix.A few inovative arrangements and some unexpected selections willkeep your interest, but for the most part this is second rate.Add a star if your only serving salsa and chips with premixed Margaritas and a fanatic for ping pong ball stereo effects!"
5,Stainless steel knives,"I was looking for these stainless still knives for the longest, when I found them in Amazon I was very happy... After I have been using them i am happier now. They are excellent, and i love the wood part. It was exactly what i expected.Thanks,"
3,Good for the price,"These are very budget steak knives, but I expected that for the price. Not incredibly sharp and the wood handle looks a little rough (I've seen nicer in some less-expensive, commercial steakhouses) but it does cut a steak!"
5,Dancin' in the Kitchen,The book is wonderful. It has been a great teaching tool for my elementary music students. They love the pictures and laughed all the way through the story line. It reinforced my idea of dancing in the kitchen while helping each other to prepare a meal and share joy with each other.
2,made me break out.. will NOT buy again,This Product is greesy and made me break outIf you want a good lotion for your face buy MURAD lotionI sent this back for a refund then went with my first choice of Murad
4,Great product if you're willing to invest in your face,"I've been using this face lotion for a few years now, and I'm a huge fan. However, I've been receiving it as a gift, which makes it much easier on the wallet. One bottle/tube will last you almost a year with daily usage, so it's not a bad investment.This lotion really does a great job of helping with razor burn, protecting you against sun damage, and keeping your skin feeling and looking smooth and healthy. Plus, it has a very mild orange scent that I like, and that women around me tend to enjoy. They really made a great product here, with no allergens and extremely high quality ingredients (I think, what do any of us really know?) Regardless, if you can afford it, go for it! You won't regret it, unless you get addicted like me."
1,Not Worth The $,"Unimpressed. I have been using a similar product that was just as pricey. I thought this was cheaper, but the size was just smaller. It reminds me of putting sunscreen on. It has a citrus smell. A waste of money for me. I guess I will use it before I go out in the yard for sunscreen."
1,Written by Bill and Ted?,"This book opens with a MILF-type woman, wearing nothing but silk scarves, attending a rave on an abandoned ship. Ships shoot tinsel, everything is sparkling, amazing, awesome, or awesome.Really, there's not much to say. It goes downhill from there."
2,Somebody's numbers are off. $30 for 6 mailers? No way.,"The product details page (where you are reading this now) says that you get SIX mailers for the ridiculously high price of $29.99.If you click to the inside ""used"" sellers, one of them clarifies that you actually get 250 mailers, which is a much, much better deal, working out to 28 cents per bag. The other seller only says the mailers are brand new. That doesn't help much. I'd buy from the cheaper place ($30 versus $70) if they would clarify they're selling the same thing, but otherwise no.Please IGNORE the rating. I had to give something. I'm sure the mailers work just fine. It's the quantity Amazon assigns which is misleading."
5,Great video,"Extremely insightful. Relates the latest discoveries regarding the creation of the universe and the special place the earth holds in it. Based on this information, some of the most learned astro physicists and cosmologists now agree that there must be a master designer that put the universe into motion and orchestrated all the physical elements to allow the earth to sustain life. This movie is on par with the ""Case for the Creator"" and ""The Privileged Planet""."
1,creationist claptrap - beware,"this dvd is all about proselytizing and should clearlybe labeled as such - what is offered is a fairy talehistory of the universe and is so compromised in itspresentation that no useful science can be gained from it -instead it rehashes old ""arguments"" [e.g. via probability,which was demolished by Hume centuries ago -- see also someof the other reviews for references to specific refutations]-to top it off, the narrator's monotone is strictly for amateurnight - not to worry about taking up any precious shelf space:this one's for the trash can"
3,The Stick,The Stick was highly recommended by my physical fitness trainer. She recommended that I use it to relief muscle tenseness. I have used it a couple of times. I don't really feel a difference at this point.
2,Not so effective.,"I purchased the stick, as a result of the positive reviews, to work out some kinks in my shoulder and thighs. It actually caued more discomfort than I origanilly had. (I would not recommend)."
4,pretty good massager,"I got this massager stick to help work out the knots in my legs after my runs. It really helps me get rid of the knots a lot sooner and recover faster. The only thing I was a little disappointed with is that the stick seems to get more flexible (""bendy"") as I've used it more. So, it makes a bit difficult to really dig in there at times."
4,Seems to work well...,"I use the Stick almost daily before and after my runs (up to 10 miles, but usually 2-4 miles). I suffer from Compartment Syndrome and have had compartment release surgery on my left leg in the past. The successful surgery allowed me to continue to run. Unfortunately, over the past year, my right leg began exhibiting symptoms of compartment syndrome. Not wanting to endure additional surgery and on my doc's advice, I purchased the Stick. The idea is to loosen the facia of the leg muscles before and after the run in order to allow increased expansion of the leg muscles during exercise. It seems to work. I've had decresed symptoms and believe I can continue to run without resorting to surgery."
5,Moderate Runner,"I run about 3 times a week, averaging around 6 miles each run. This has definitely supplemented by stretching. The muscle stiffness no longer happens on long runs if I use this. I generally do about 10 - 15 minutes of usage over my legs afterwards. Be careful with utilizing near the spine and middle of back. If you do, do so gently. I made the mistake of not following the advertised instructions by working a knot out of my back too abruptly. I ended up in pain the next day. Otherwise great product and I'd buy it again."
2,Doesn't really work.,I bought this product because my chiropractor recommended me. I used it a little bit but it didn't really help the muscle problem I had.
1,received an empty container,"ordered the original body stick from Med Health Productsshippment arrived in a timely manner but that is the end of the good side of the story. the shippment arrived via usps priority mail in a tube with plastic end caps except one end cap was missing and so was the product. only the shipping paper was there. i reported it to the company who said that, that had never happened before. they offered to refund half of the purchase price. unacceptable response since i have no control over how item was packed or shipped. i feel i should get a replacement item shipped or get all my money refuned.rhonda lackmann"
5,very good stick,bought this stick after saw a teammate using this stick to massage/relax the muscles. very good for cramping too during games.
5,Great for anyone,I use this before and after a lot of my workouts and it helps out a ton. Whenever I have a sore muscle or group of muscles I use this and it help relieve it and makes my body feel better.
5,The super Stick,I am a mountain biker and I have been using this product after every long ride. It really aids in recovery. I have also found that my calves are really tight and knotted. Using the Stick I have been able to keep my calves feeling great. I am looking to buy another one to keep in my race bag.
3,A rolling pin does the same thing!,"The runners' websites recommend foam rollers and THE STICK for sore muscles. I had the foam roller (GOFIT) and it worked amazingly, but I couldn't get to the neck/shoulder area with the foam roller. I, therefore, decided to get the STICK. I was not impressed with the STICK.The stick rolls across the body like a rolling pin but it doesn't hammer out the knots like the foam rollers do. I returned my ""stick."" I now use the foam roller and in a pinch I use the rolling pin."
1,Oh No!,"Ahhh! It's like attack of the worst games! Simisle, was boring, confusing, and even if you do get it running, and your island town actually works, Bababoom!, you're bankrupt. More like a work program then a computer game, I would advise any gameplayer to try Sims or Sims 2, because those are fun and actually entertaining!"
3,"I like it, but...","This cd is pretty good. More enjoyable than pretty much anything you hear on the radio... but my favorite songs are the ones that remind me of the Brian Jonestown Massacre. And while I am sure this will sound kind of mean, I get WAY more enjoyment for the $$$ out of my BJM cds than I do from Matt Hollywood's solo stuff.Don't get me wrong, this cd is solid, and if you love the BJM (particularly the earlier stuff... which should be obvsious since that is when Hollywood was in the band) you should totally get it. But from an overall recomendation/review stand point, I would only suggest buying this cd after you have all of the full length BJM releases unless you just have a major jones (pun intended?) for some Matt Hollywood tunes."
4,Go on Give a Damn,"Amazon.com critics are harsh. Out Crowd's albums show how much BJM depended (and still depends) on Matt Hollwoood to write a SONG.C'Mon Children is great track, filled with attitude and spot on lyrics about drug girls/boys and Honey, I ain't High could be covered by Keith Richards.Reptile and Gemini gets you into a good groove and sums up the vibe of the band they get into fully with the later, magnificent Then I Saw the Holy CityOnly thing bad about this album is it is one of two albums before they broke up.Oh, and I got my copy at a discount cause of the length, so quit whining and get into it."
1,THIS IS NOT DISPATCH,"hello this is not the Dispatch from the NE, this aint braddigan, chetro and repete look at the cover.right?"
2,Quick Peel,"This product's pitch should state more clearly that it only works with Quick Peel Compatible Labels. The labels I use don't come that way, so I can't use the peeler at all. It's just sitting in my office like new."
1,A piece of junk,"The Avery Label Peeler is not worth the $20 I paid for it brand-new. First it would not recognize many sheets of Avery brand labels. The only suggestion the manual provides is to use Avery labels. Real helpful! When it did recognize the sheet, it frequently did not sense labels and kept advancing causing jams and destroying labels. When it was actually working properly, it was very slow to advance to next sheet, wasting 20 seconds between sheets. In conclusion, a worthless piece of junk!!!"
4,AVERY QUICK PEEL AUTOMATIC 9000,Although we do not affix many laser labels this little machine makes the task go much faster than affixing labels by hand. It is easy to set up and easy to use.
5,Great follow-up to the original,"Whiteout: Melt exceeded my expectations for a ""sequel"". It's a great story about Carrie; an U.S. Marshall assigned to the coldest territory on Earth. While it is a cold and gritty spy/crime story, there's actually a little romance for our female Marshall. Greg Rucka (Keeper, Finder, Batman: No Man's Land) again does not fail to turn up the heat in this mesmerizing tale of cloak-and-dagger against a tundra backdrop. Steve Lieber's black-and-white art accentuates the hard-boiled mood and sense of cold in this espionage thriller. Highly recommended for anybody who likes great crime fiction or action/adventure."
4,Sequel superior to the original (and how often does THAT happen?).,"Greg Rucka, <strong>Whiteout, vol. 2: Melt</strong> (Oni Press, 2000)One of the reasons I recommend <em>Whiteout</em> so strongly is because once you've read it, you will be prepared for its sequel, <em>Melt</em>. Carrie is back in the world, but convinced to go back to Antarctica and take one more case, which involves shipments of weapons (weapons are illegal for the general populace to have in Antarctica). Rucka seems to have a slightly more solid handle on his characters here, and he puts them in some very interesting situations. A truly good book, this, well worth checking out for lovers of crime fiction, whether it's in graphic-novel mode or not. ****"
5,Great milk for your growing child,Saves fridge space and kids like it how can you go wrong. Amazon sells it for a great price. This product actuslly costs less than regular milk and is perfect for my growing twins. I hope amazon has it back in stock soon so I can order more. It is very hard to find in the USA
1,Sent wrong item!!,I was sent the wrong item over 3 weeks ago. I immediately reached out to the store who sent me an automated message that someone would contact me and still has not. The website does not allow for returns unless you go through an email back and forth process which is a pain and completely antiquated. I am still hoping to receive the correct item but am losing hope...
1,Misrepresented Product!,"The product in the picture was an excellent product that I had used before. However, it was not the product I received. The product I received had the advertised model number, but was completely different. The torsion spring case on the product I received takes up additional space, so it won't fit in some installations. The door hold-open sprag didn't work."
2,repeat dvd,"I absolutely love this show and was excited to see another DVD but I have to say that I was disappointed in this DVD. The description does not let you know what is in it so you will purchaseit. If you have season 3, don't buy this DVD! This DVD contains some of the shows from the 3rd season not anything new shows. I don't see how they can call it season 2 Vol 2. They do not even put a content list of what is on the disc's in the cover of the show."
2,poor mold,11 out of 12 of the molds were good. but one did not have the design depressed well enough and i couldn't use it
1,nice until,"I purchased 6 of these lights, out of the boxthe seem well build. I hung them on my deckthe next morning i notices the support rod had slippedout of place and the shape change. I PUT THE SUPPORT WIRE BACK WHERE IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE and hung it back up next daysame thing after a few days of this saw what was happening when the material gets wet from the dew it expands and lets thesupport bar slip out of place. THIS was VERY DISAPPOINTING I SEND THEM BACK"
1,WARNING: item is mis-titled,"Like the reviewer above, you may be looking for a ""pie iron,"" which is a closed iron in which you can cook pies, sandwitches, etc. This is not a ""pie iron"" but is instead a hamburger cooker -- it has open slots for drippings to run out. I'm sure it works fine for hamburgers but if you want to make sandwitches, etc., DON'T order this!"
2,Needs updating,"First, I Love this book and very much enjoy Nigel Calders writing. I have encountered this book on other peoples boats for some years now and felt maybe it was time I get my own copy. I wrongly assumed that Nigel like other sailor/writers of cruising books dating even back to the 1970's had updated or amended the book where appropriate. This was definitely an error. There have simply been too many changes in the last decade to recommend this book. Perhaps at 1/3 of Amazons current price I could justify it, but as it stands it is as obsolete as my old 121 EPIRB. I will be returning it."
5,It's a Beauty,"Nigel has great credibility and this book adds to this. His approach to writing about the stuff cruisers need to know is clean, clear and spare. The illustrations are good. The index is outstanding.This book is a great add-on for those who already have his earlier maintenance book"
3,mostly about calder's boat,this is book about cruising in a sailboat but is mostly filled with pictures and references to his sailboat and what a great boat it is. i wanted a book about cruising after you have a boat.
1,"Hate to say it, but...","This book is rather disappointing. Nygaard's photographs are lackluster and the reproductions are worse than you would find in your daily newspaper. As only the second American to be crowned World Driving Champion, Mario deserves better."
3,wrong color,I was very disappointed in the color. My granddaughter loves purple.The color was nothing like the picture.
1,The Michael Moore Toilet Cleaning Service,"HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! This is so funny. Michael Moore looks very stupid holding a toilet plunger. Would you seriously hang a calendar of this big, fat, slob in your room or house? Where would it go? over the toilet?"
3,Way Out West '- Stealth,"STEALTH sneaks in a few remixes: Way Out West take their own track and push up the 4/4 and the strings to frame Kirsty Hawkshaw's vocals, while Rennie Pilgrem & Commie attach some breaks, while maintaining the delicacy of the melody. The intensity build somewhat, though it never explodes. Not that it has to, of course. Stealth is supposed to be... stealthy, after all."
4,Great Cookbook - Fun to read!!,I love this cookbook. I never knew you could do so much with pickled eggs! The stories about Ultra-Violet were entertaining and heartwarming. I also enjoyed all the litte tidbits about the state of MissouriI love the names of the recipes. I've never much cared for pickled eggs but I'm going to try some of these recipes. If Ultra-Violet's family enjoyed them all those years - they must be good!
4,Hitachi sheathing stapler,"product is light weight and balanced, which makes for ease of use during longer periods of use. It is easy to load or change size of staples. I have not had any jambs or misfires since purchasing tool."
3,Crown stapler,"I am a bit concerned about the operation at start-up. It takes a dozen or so staples to get it to working correctly. It will not set the staple until you waste a dozen or so to ""warm up"" the gun."
4,"Good, practical advice","I picked up this book at CES and read it from beginning to end. The authors' present an intriguing theory and they back it up with very detailed explanations of ""how to."" Well worth the money and $$ for anyone looking to innovate in a crowded marketplace."
4,Making Meaning,"This book is a great resource for anyone working in marketing or research. Learning how to communicate with consumers in a meaningful way is the key to earning both their respect and their business. The authors' years of experience is synthesized into a concise and practical guide to creating meaningful experiences for consumers, including many specific examples of how ""making meaning"" actually works. Their suggestions will help to elevate brands to new levels in the eyes of customers."
2,"A bunch of Introductions, but no real beef - yet at times inspiring..","Even though the book has a good aim, and has chosen a very challenging subject that is at most of emerging nature currently, still the authors manage to shoot all over the fence without really delivering anything specific in any of the areas - it feels more like reading a bunch of Introductions.Nice read through as a speed-read, but was disappointed for my money. It seems like the authors have tried to include everything into their book and haven't been able to kill their babies and scope down into one particular area.I'd say best use of the book is of inspirational value for your own workings."
1,Making Meaning: How Successful Business Deliver Meaningful Customer Experiences,I skimmed through the book and found it to be of little meaning. There did not appear to be any substance to it. I sent it back for refund. I have never returned a book before this one. I am not sure why this book was published. Try again.
1,Last drill motor out of truck,"On the plus side this drill motor powers large selfeed bits through lumber. On the negetive side, it is heavy,awkward and has a very sensitive triggerpull. Picking this drill up by the long trigger end is DANGEROUS! The black plastic cover over the head of drill has a lip on the underside that can catch fingertips in. The four Milwaukee drill motors leave the truck first every time!"
3,"Great shine, hard work","Keep in mind that 1) I hate to wax my car and 2) my brother raved about how easy the Ice liquid worked. Ice paste wax gives an icy beautiful shine, does not haze or ruin the black rubber/plastic on the car, and is the same hard work of traditional waxes."
1,inability to clean,"I have hard water. I washed my car and dried it with a chamois. However, there were some water spots, especially on the hood of the car. I assumed the turtle wax ice paste would clean off the water spots while in the polish/waxing process. It did not touch the water spots. I am afraid it even helped preserve the water spots, making it impossible to get rid of them the next time I wash the car. Only time will tell. I hope my car's finish is not irreparably damaged. Do not think this product will provide any cleaning ability whatsoever. Also, it states you can use it in the sun and on hot surfaces. Don't do it. On the hood, it seemed to smear around rather than wipe off and buff to a nice shine. I am super disappointed and will throw it away. A waste of $16 for sure."
5,Excellent wax -not very long lasting,"I've used this product for at least 3 years and I am very pleased. You don't have to worry about staining anything because it's transparent and it literally goes everywhere. It does not give a deep shine, instead it makes your car look as if it was wrapped with cellophane (meaning, it does shine and a lot, but a different kind of shine). I like it, but I normally polish the paint first and then apply this wax to give extra shine.The shine lasts but the protection is normally gone after a month or so, depending on how much sun the car gets.All in all a good product that seems to be underrated. It comes with an applicator pad and microfiber towel tat I still have."
3,mary's views,this book replaced one that i had at the house that was in bad shape with pages missing. i was glad to see that there were publishers still printing it. i like to pass this type of books to my grandkids.
3,details,"I have not yet read this book. I was searching for christian social work material and found the chapter titles for this book applicable to topics that interested me. However, I am not sure that chapter 11 ""Christianity and the Treatment of Addition: An Ecological Approach for Social Workers"" p. 193 is even applicable. I presume that it should read ""Addiction"". I would not let a little thing like type-o's stop me from purchasing the book."
2,"Good Features, Bad Performance","I loved all the features, cables included, front panel, cables all in the back, good HotKey sequence, but the performance was so slow, my mouse and keyboard crawled, that I had to return it."
4,A great book!,"As an R.N., and a colon therapist, I found this book to be one of the most concise and thorough books on the subject. It is easy to read and will make a wonderful resource book for my clients. A welcomed addition to my library!"
4,"i was poisoned by my body, etc.....","i had been feeling like the ""only person in town"" who has mcs problems. dr.gilbere assured me that was not the case. she was kind, caring, and worked with me via phone. suggesting herbs(and other remedies)....she called me back to ask how i was doing.....and suggested alternatives for diet, told me of a mask that came in handy on a flight back to the midwest....an air cleaner for my home; and many, many other affordable products...i feel much better, and continue to work with dr.gilbere...and respect what she has accomplished. the book is clear, and easy to understand........and i thank her........."
1,I was poisoned by this book,"Perhaps I am naive, or unenlighted. But if that is the case, then so were the people I shared parts of this book with as well. I have fibermyalgia, and of course I bought the book hoping for some ""inside"" information from a person who supposedly works in the health care field. I think I could get as many radical suggestions from a Wich Doctor with more probable success. Her remedies are extreme and out in left field. This book is not for the average person who is trying to find ways to cope with cronic pain or illness. It is for those who have already turned the corner to the organic funny farm!"
2,Written at the wrong level.,If you already know what autointoxication and Leaky Gut Syndrome are this book will not offer anything that you don't already know. If you are not familiar with these syndromes then this book will be way over your head. She doesn't explain concepts very well and seems to be just rephrasing the words of others. To learn about this subject you would be better off reading the works of Leo Galland or Sherry Rogers.
5,"Slowly getting tired of ""Red John""","Even though I still love this show and the interactions of the characters, I think they should wrap up the Red John story line so the viewer can see what Patrick Jane will do without his arch nemesis."
5,Good Opener,Good season opener. Jane is at it again. His antics this episode are very funny. I'd hate to have him after me!
4,A darker Jane on new season 5 mentalist!,I will say that amazon video quality is getting better from a year ago. I found the video quality to be much better although not quite the quality compared to similar shows on netflix. That being said Mentalist is finally digging deeper to the main arc of the story which is Jane's search for Red John. I particularly like how they are trying to turn the show to a point where they will get to revealing Red John. Jane has become a darker character than the goof-ball he was in the earlier seasons.
1,Why I wont purchase the videos from amazon anymore,"I want to start out by saying I love Amazon. I really appreciate the work you guys do for your delievery and it just rocks. NOW about your online video purchases, I have rented a couple of movies from you and all of them was really slow downloading, enough to where the video was cut out MULTIPLE TIMES! Then this purchase cut out SO bad that it would not even let me watch the movie when I bought it. I had to literally go and buy this video from xbox live and it downloaded immediately. I do appreciate you guys but I need to save my money.Thank you"
3,Misnomer,"I consider this episode a slight improvement over the shows ending Season 4, but it's still stuck in the Red John rut. It's nowhere near as good as the next two episodes: Dove Cameron's performance in her guest role just blew me away, and Robin Tunney's characterization of Teresa Lisbon just keeps getting deeper in subtle ways. The whole team is beautifully played and their characters well-realized; I wish the concentration would be there instead of on a silly meandering plot about a seemingly omniscient and nearly omnipotent Red John.What I want to know about this episode is why Amazon calls it ""The Red Glass Bead."" The rest of the world seems to call it ""The Crimson Ticket."" I would also like to know why, having moved some _other_ episodes to another drive to make space, this year's episodes now show as ""not downloaded"" in Unbox. Amazon has some work to do on that software."
3,I am getting so sick of this red john angle!,"I love the mentalist but the writers are spending way too much time on this red john angle. I fear that they are writting themselves off a cliff because every episode this season main focus is red john.They are not really focused on patrick jane's crime fighting skills. I can't even recall if there was another case being worked besides this red john angle. I fear that I'm going to have to start watching castle if they don't sh**t or get off the pot with this red john thing! Kill him already or kill the show! It has to be one or the other because as much as I love the mentalist, I am getting real tired of watching it! It's almost as bad as the alien angle on the x-files! Wow, towards the end I could have carved my eyes out watching that unfold! Lol. Get better please or else castle here I come! Lol!"
1,horrible,The episode was horrible. The murder mystery made no sense. There was no reason to connect the murder victim with the lottery yet like almost all the other episodes he jumps a cliff so wide that it made no sense whatsoever and wouldn't survive a day in court. The whole red john thing is getting old. Do something with it or just give it up.
5,The mentalist season 5 review,Awesome I really love the show it's so great to see the mentalist and watch what the writers are going todo next! I also really love the mentalist Simon Baker and he adds so much to the show and once again he just amazes me!!
1,unwatchable. UNBOX bad idea!!!,"Paid and downloaded into my computer and now can't watch it. I have unbox but have uninstalled Windows Media Player as I did not like the software for bloat and resource, and I have a few better - simpler - video watching programs. However, even though I have this on my computer I cannot watch it with Nero or any other video program as it is DRM protected. What a crock !! A video at any price is wortless if you cannot watch it. Took about 27 minutes to download and we have DSL.Amazon needs to allow something other than Windows Media Player to control their unbox. Because without that piece of junk software you CANNOT watch what you just bought!!"
5,Perfect,This is why I love Amazon prime. I am a fan of the mentalist but occasionally my DVR messes up and I miss part of the show. I am able to go back and get all the missing pieces now.
4,Just discovered this show,I just discovered this show on TNT. I did not until recently realize that the current season aired on CBS. I haven't completed watching all of the current shows this season yet but I think the 5th season isn't quite as strong as the previous ones. That said - I think it is still a really engaging show and fun to watch.
3,"Terrific show, but I am disappointed with Amazon","Season 5 of ""The Mentalist"" is great so far. Production is a bit spotty (there's not a new episode every week), but they are giving Lisbon more of a role than they have in the past. The pricing on Amazon is not good. To buy the season from iTunes, you just subscribe and pay once--the episodes download automatically as they become available. Amazon asks for a subscription payment for existing episodes, and then charges you again for each new episode. I recommend going with iTunes if you want the series. And I strongly recommend the series."
5,CBI and the FBI Fight over a Red John Witness,"In the fifth season opener, the CBI and FBI join forces to cover up the mess created when the FBI botched a CBI mission to capture Red John and a CBI agent is brutally murdered. Bertram is back playing politics with his FBI counterpart, and Patrick Jane is determined to crack captured Red John disciple Lorelei (EMMANUELLE CHRIQUI). The case of the week is a doozy - a double homicide with no apparent connection between the two victims. When the CBI and FBI are forced to play nice and investigate the double homicide together, Jane uses his skills to solve the case and to force the FBI to relinquish custody of Lorelei. Great start to the season."
2,No consistancy,"Some of the episodes are pretty good, but some are so sloppily written, you wonder why not to hire proper writers who could actually carry out the plot and keep viewers interested."
4,Still love jane,There's no such thing as psychics.but that's ok. I like Jane better anyway. I love how the red John mystery keeps you guessing.
2,Way to Tempermental,"First of all the positives about this scanner.1. It's fast. Very fast. Whether simplex or duplex.2. High quality scans.3. Easy to install.Now for the negatives:1. If the paper is not ""fresh off the printer/copier"" and in absolute PERFECT form, the ADF will jam EVERYTIME. Not only does it jam, it wads your original into a tight, crinkled up ball of paper.If the originals were stapled together...forget about it. You have to remove the staple, copy the first page, and then run it through this scanner.Although it is very fast (if you can get it to accept the originals), this is negated by the many trips to the copier to freshen up the first page.This is my biggest negative and the main reason for such a low rating.2. The ADF cannot auto-detect legal size documents. This makes it difficult to scan files that have a mixture of letter and legal."
3,Works well WHEN it works,This is our second scanner we have had problems with. The first scanner worked well for a few months then it jams all the time with the adf.We sent it back and got another from xerox worked well again for a awhile then like clockwork it jams all the time and documents are torn a part with the roller. We scan 5000- 8000 or so a week. This year we are already having problems with our second model. If you scan normal weight paper it appears to do this well but our documents we work with are of a lighter paper weight.Three stars because when it does work it works very well and is fast. When it jams it can be a pain.
1,good for a while,"i've scanned over 10k pages with this scanner. all fine. then i all of a sudden cannot scan anymore. it gives me a paper jam error. i've done everything i possibly can do. then i called amazon since i got the extended warranty and they referred me to xerox who hung up on me about 4 times and argued with me EVERY TIME about a ""serial number"" and refused to truly help me. i never got an answer and now own a 1300 dollar clunker, with a useless warranty. tomorrow i'm going to keep calling and try to get an answer because i didn't pay this much to have it tucker out this new. i'm very very very disappointed, mainly in the fact that the warranty from amazon means nothing and that xerox itself is totally unhelpful."
3,There must be better out there,"After a couple of months of daily use, it stops scanning well and starts jamming up even 4 pages in the ADF. I'm looking for something new that is durable because this certainly isn't. I'm scanning for an office so of course most of the pages have had staples in them. Apparently the scanner hates pages that have ever had a staple in it at all. It's a shame because I really like this scanner when it works but the paper jams are just infuriating."
1,"LOOK GOOD, BUT CHEAP QUALITY INSIDE","Kettle looks good, but inside quality is not good. First time I boiled water in it rust spot came out in it kettle cover. I used this kettle for 10 days after kettle enamble is taking out. I try to boiled water in it inside enamble taking out every time after 10 days. I had a bad experiences with this kettle."
1,you get what you pay for,"the enamel inside has come off bit by bit after only one year of use....i don't know if that is why i have been feeling lousy lately, but i am buying a new, solid stainless steel kettle. i threw this one in the trash."
1,The Absolute Worst,"I've never spent so much wasted time trying to get a program to do what I want it to. This is the most rediculous, convoluted way to create a simple calendar, using your own photos in your own chosen order, that I've ever seen in my life. Calendar Creator 4 was simple and straight forward, it just didn't add your photos. Finally I've upgraded and luckily I found a rebate that made this p.o.s. software free. If you want to make calendars with THEIR pictures, maybe you'll like this. There's got to be a better way..."
1,No PDF function - advertising on box is false,"This product states in several places on the box that you can save and/or e-mail calendar files in PDF format. This is a false statement. The PDF file functions are only found in the more expensive ""Deluxe"" version. We called the manufacturer's customer support number and, after a lengthy wait, a support tech confirmed the only the deluxe version could do PDF files. He did not seem surprised to learn that the standard 2005 version box claimed to have that function included. This is blatent false advertising. DO NOT BE MISLED!"
3,the only thing wrong,"After owning 7-10 pairs, the only thing wrong with these boots are the sole wears out faster then the boot, if you actually wear them to work."
5,Right out of the box,"I had got the hard toe first by mistake, they did fit at first but after wearing them for about ten days they were killing my toes, there was a small gap between the steel and the leather that the side of my foot rubbed on, so I sent them back and got the soft toe put them on, best feeling new boot I have ever got no break in, the only con I have and its nothing to do with the boots they didn't come in black. I wear all black on my job so brown does stand out. Buy these boots you will love them."
1,Spell Check,"Do you know how to spell ""Pittsburgh""? Was the copy written by a Browns' fan? Is this a Pittsburg, Kansas Steelers team? Does the NFL know? Copyright violations? Call the Rooneys! READ THE DVD BOX! Maybe it's the Picksburg Steelers."
5,The Steelers,"What could possibly be wrong with anything about ""MY' Team!! the DVD was a gift to my family...life long fans"
3,Film Noir?,"The House Across The Street is a good B film. It's the old story of a newspaper man going after the town mobster, with a good pace and funny script. But it's not film noir. Homicide is also a good B film. It's a fast moving police procedural drama. But it's not film noir. Someone at Warner Bros. has the impression that if the picture is a B and photographed in black and white it is film noir. Not only is that true in this case, but they have packaged and sold these titles as film noir because they have absolutely no commercial value otherwise. Seems a dishonest, unethical thing to do, especially when they have so many titles of the real thing yet to be released. If you're a film buff, go for it. If you want serious film noir, beware."
3,Greg Carpenter Oakton VA,"I just bought this nailer and took it to the job site. The gun shoots well and sinks every nail, however the clip that holds the nails jumps when fired. Therefore, you have to keep adjusting the clip almost everytime you shoot the gun. I am very frustrated that hitachi would make a cheap clip. If I were to purchase another gun I would recommend the NR83A or the NR90AC which offers a different clip. The NR83A I have never had a problem with the gun. The gun is 20 years old.Best RegardsGreg"
3,Nice Looking Unit For The Price.,I had to file out the two outer holes just a little to get it to fit but once in place it looks good and should be strong and last a long time.
5,great book and fast shipping,I purchased this book because it was recommended by Project Appleseed instructors (appleseedinfo.org) patriot marksmanship clinic (I highly recommend you check them out!) This book is well-researched and well-written. It reads like a novel captivating the reader's attention. I love it!
1,Avoid the Kindle Edition,"Don't buy the Kindle edition, you will be disappointed. Footnotes are not linked so you have to manually flip to the location and find each one, requiring (for me) keeping notes of what location the notes are on. The text is left AND right justified, so the spacing between words is widely uneven and distracting, the default font is larger than normal, and there is no control over font-selection, only size.I apologize for rating the book so low because the text is excellent, worth the 5 stars so many reviewers have given it, but I wanted to call attention to the deficiencies of the Kindle version. Buy the paperback."
5,Revere's Ride,This is an absolutely wonderful account of Revere's ride. Many things that I did not previously know. One of the greatesd things about the book is all of the research the author has done and included sources. Wonderful way to write an historic book.
5,Exceptional history of one of our less told events,"Ironically while Paul Revere's ride is a well known historical event, and the subject of one of the greatest epic poems of all time, very little is actually known about the events of April 19,1775. David Hackett Fisher does an amazing job of building up to the fatal events and gives a strong background which shows he did his research. Little known historical events that built up to the fateful events on April 19 are given a complete examination and the tenor of the times are built up excellently.This is the rare type of book that manages to be both very educational, even for adults while at the same time being a highly readable and entertaining book. Fisher makes all of the participants seem as real, flesh and blood individuals. This is one of the premiere Revolutionary War histories of recent times."
5,Read it Aloud,I recommend it if only for the description of the midnight ride. The author makes you feel like you're in the moment.It reads well aloud if you have a need to entertain young or old.
2,Overrated,I am a David Hackett Fisher fan but this book just doesn't do anything for me. It is a very choppy book for me to read and the subject matter isn't as interesting as I thought it would be.
5,Puts you right there.,A wonderful in-depth history of the pivot point that began the American Revolution. Reads like a novel and I was transported to that time as if by magic. Couldn't put it down. It paints a vivid portrait of the individuals on both sides. I was particularly interested since one of my ancestors was in the Lexington Militia and fought at Concord - brought my history alive.
3,Why these places?,"The data and information finished for each city seemed to be up to date and useful. The selection of which city were included was just weird. California had only three cities: the old line, expensive Palm Springs, San Diego, and Santa Barbara. On the other hand, Alaska also has three cities: Anchorage, Homer, and Palmer. How Alaska is beautiful and a great place to take an extended summer vacation, but I would think only a few people will want to retire there. It just seemed to be a random selection of cities around the US.I do not know what was on the CD. The CD software would not install on my computer (Window XP). It seemed to be trying to access/change off limit areas."
3,Retire? good reading,"Good information on healthcare & taxes. Easy read, good information. Alot of this book seems totally out of reach for some people on a smaller retirement income"
1,"Just standard jpegs, no video in this package","Hey troopers. If you want some more jpeg images to use as backgrounds this is it. If you want ""video"" for background this is NOT IT. These are just jpegs, no movement what so ever. As standard jpeg images they are not as varied or as good as other packages sold for standard still photos. Since these don't move, other packages are much better.200 Digital Photography Backgrounds Scenic and Urban Photo Backdrop Images h"
5,great peeler,This is the best peeler. It has a safety feature. It has a straight edge side for potatoes or carrots.. Then it has a serated side for kiwi or peaches. There is a plastic cover for the side not being used while peeling. This is good for when my 8 yr old grand daughter peels her kiwis. I have 3 peelers. I will be tossing the other 2.
4,Good leadership book,This book I used during a graduate school course and it was very easy to read and understand.
3,Be careful what you order,I ordered this watch twice. The first time I recived something completly different and the second time it was the right watch but with a different band than the one pictured. Thanks Amazon. Fortunantly I like the second watch but I wouldn't order any other watches from Amazon.com
5,Great deal.,"Delivered as promised.Good quality. Looks good. Because of the price, I was almost expecting something flimsy. Absolutely great product."
5,Book Review,"The book, 'If My Mom Were A Platypus'was written by Dia L. Michels. It provides a nice introduction to 13 animals (including humans), and provides basic information regarding birth, growth, diet, and other interesting scientific facts. Written from the point of view of the newborn animal and it's mother, the book is targeted towards upper elementary and middle school audiences. However, it can be enjoyed by younger children. It makes a good family readaloud and can be used for basic research. The illustrations are realistic and colorful, and the book includes a glossary and index."
2,Difficult to operate,The switch on this drill is difficult to operate. Myself and two other guys had problems with it. The drill is either locked on or off. If the bit jambs you can not quickly stop the drill or for any matter it is difficult to stop. This is a problem and will probably burn up the motor when it is jambed and attempts to turn. I guess if Hitachi makes a better switch or even a simple trigger it would be a great drill. I am returning mine tomorrow.
3,Not enough power for 1 inch auger bit,"I'm wiring a new cabin and needed something to drill 1 inch holes through studs and joist. I wanted low speed high torque for use with self feed auger bit but this tool would not drill unless it was set to high speed. It worked using high speed but you better hold on as you break through the board, this is a real knuckle buster! I switched to a 1 inch spade bit and that was much better, I could lower speed and it was smooth and less dangerous. Also tried a hole saw but that takes too much time. I did not have any problem with the switch as some complain about, that works fine for me. Bottom line though is this lacks torque at slow speed with bigger self feed bits, but I think that's typical of most 3/8 drills."
2,not too happy,We have other hitachis about four years old and they still work well. Thia new one is the samw but the lock switch on the handle did not work out of the box. Very annoying.
4,Overall a great phone,"I took back a RCA 2 line Phone and AT&T; 2 line phone because the sound quality was terrible.I needed a two line phone with good features especially the speakerphone. This phone offers the best spearker phone and volume I've had since my siemens. Good features and easy to set up.The only negative things I wish is that it had one touch dialing buttons, a little bigger LCD screen, and a 1 touch button for messages. Minor problems considering the sound quality is superb!! Uniden wins when it comes to quality clear sound."
4,very pleased in all ways,"replaced old Siemens 2 line system that was falling apart. Worked like a champ out of the box. Easy to set up, flawless clarity, excellent features, good range. And new handsets on sale locally for $24!! Highly recommended"
5,Great Cordless Phones (with great battery life),"I purchased this phone a month ago to replace my Panasonic cordless phone system. The battery life on my old system was terrible. These phones are great and so is the battery life! I also purchased several of the Uniden TCX905 Accessory Handset and Charger for the T9 Series, which are also great."
2,dont like it,"I do not like this phone at all and am getting another one. I have terrible issues with static which my service provider has told me (twice) is a phone not a line issue. The other major thing i don't like is that the handsets blink when there is a message on the answering machine (which also lights up so there is no question that there is a message) but there is not an indicator that there is a message in the voice mail box.as far as the rest of the phone is concerned, it seems to be ok"
2,"Ok phone, marginal answering machine","2 line phone, operates like 2 separate answering machinesMust make 2 separate outgoing messages (ok, I can do it twice)Must call home twice to get messages off of each line (unacceptable)Also:Phone has Caller ID, but one must set time manually. Other phones set their time automatically from Caller ID info."
1,Poor sound quality - horrible customer service,"KEEP YOUR RECEIPT - AFTER YOU WAIT FOR 30 MIN ON HOLD FOR CUSTOMER SERVICE THEY WILL DO NOTHING FOR YOU WITHOUT YOUR RECEIPT IT IS THERE ESCAPE CLAUSE FOR THE POOR QUALITY PRODUCT THEY PUT OUT. AFTER 6 MONTHS MY EXTRA HANDSETS STARTED CLICKING AND POPPING, I CONTACTED UNIDEN AND WAS FRUSTRATED BEYOND BELIEF, LUCKILY I HAD MY RECEIPT SENT THE PHONES (0N MY DIME) TO THEM AFTER SEVERAL WEEKS THEY SEND ME TO REFERBISED FACTORY PHONES, BOTH DID NOT WORK, CALLED AGAIN THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO SEND ME TWO MORE, THEY NEVER CAME, WHEN i CALLED THEY SAID THE SECOND ORDER DID NOT HAVE A RECEIPT ATTACHED TO IT SO THEY DID NOT SEND THE PHONES, PS HAVE NOT HAD PHONES FOR OVER A MONTH AND STILL WAITING FOR THE REPLACEMENTS."
3,Uniden 2 line phone system - refurbished,The base station will no longer register additional handsets. I have not yet contacted the seller.
1,Good features BUT major flaw,"I bought this item and I am getting it ready to return as we write.The caller ID ONLY shows on the lcds during the first ring. After that it only shows: ""Incoming call.."" as if the ringing meant something else. This is a major flaw since it prevents you from screening your caller.The sound level of the rings is a bit too low, specially for the musical tones. I could live with this but not with the useless CID.The answering machine would not store/record incoming calls. I guess this particular unit may have been defective in that respect."
3,Uniden PowerMax 5.8GHz,"this is a two line phone, with extendible remotes. it comes with one remote. the outgoing audio quality of the base station desktop phone is not as good as the quality of the remote phone. indeed, although my voice is sometimes difficult to understand, friends have had significantly more difficulty understanding me when i speak into the handset of the base station, than when i use the remote. because of this problem, i would not buy this phone again.there are all the regular bells and whistles on the base station, but some are missing on the remote. there is no redial button on the remote, so you either have to store the number you are calling or dial it again (there is a redial on the base, but it doesn't matter when you are away from your base.)"
4,TRU9496 good but...,"Bought TRU9496 because it supports two lines and can use up to 10 handsets. Also bought several TCX905 and TWX977 handsets. Overall we are VERY happy with everything. The only problem is that the range is limited. If a handset is 50 feet from the base, there is a lot of static and you can get disconnected. Uniden has consistently avoided giving even a hint as to what range can be expected. Since I have very cheap walky-talkies that have much better range, I would think that they could have made the phones better. Other than that, these products are very impressive."
3,Nice phone ..trouble with handset & service stinks!,"The 2-line base station is a very good solution for my home office. Clarity is exceptional. A well-thought out design for recording separate messages for each line. My line has caller ID (Highly recommended) which allows easy phone number recall and move to phone book for permanent storage.After one week, I had problem with portable handset. Handset would ""freeze"" ,i.e. would not respond to any key and not light-up. I called Uniden customer service three times -- each time 1/2 hour wait to talk to customer service! After a number of suggested fixes --- pull-out battery and hit * # keys --- to re-set handset, problem continued again after a short time.Uniden said to send handset to Texas for ""possible"" replacement. Now I am one phone short for two weeks and who knows what will come back ...plus shipping $$$ on me. Uniden refused to send me a new replacement. This handset is in-use for only one week.A great phone buy ---if it works ! Good luck."
2,Doesn't work well with network-based voicemail,"I bought this phone for home use to sit on my office desk because it was a 2 line corded base unit w/ cordless phones that I could use elsewhere around the house. I did not want the digital answering machine but Uniden doesn't make a 2 line corded base without it. We use the network voicemail and want to continue doing that.Because the digital answering machine is present, however, you cannot use the message indicator blinking light to signify a voicemail message on the network like you can with Uniden phones that don't have digital voicemail. Doesn't matter whether you turn off the digital answering maching or not. So, this phone is going back.No real problems with the functionality or look of the phone, but I was very disappointed that this isn't pointed out anywhere in the online documentation or capabilities. It's something I would have wanted to know ahead of time, and might be true for others...which is the reason for my post."
4,Great Phone System,This is a great alternative to an expensive phone system. It has many useful features like forwarding calls to up to 10 other handsets and all phones work off 1 phone jack. The extra handsets do not need their own phone jack connection. The phones are of great quality as well.
2,Poor Range - Poorer Customer Service,"I just received the phone system and ordered three cordless handsets. The cordless handsets have unacceptable static, even though they are less than 30' feet away. I talked to two different customer service reps. One told me they can't be used over 35 feet from the base. Another would not tell me what their suggested range should be. Needless to say I packed up all three cordless sets and the base set and shipped them all back to Amazon. A cordless business phone that cannot travel more than 30' from its base is of little use in a SOHO."
1,Not My Lucky Day,"Received phone in fine condition and was anxious to set it up but ran into problems during testing, encountering two issues that I could not resolve. First, I set the answering machine to ""on"" but it seemed to automatically turn off whenever a call came in. Very strange. Tried it several times but no success. Second, the incoming Caller ID number would only seem to appear for a couple of seconds and then it just said ""Incoming Call."" I need a phone that displays the incoming ID during the entire time the phone is ringing. Also, the general layout of the phone and button labels (or symbols) were screwy in my opinion. I tried calling customer support thinking I might get lucky (Uniden is notorious for terrible customer service) and held the line for 55 minutes before hanging up. Returned the phone the same day. My colleague has the ATT E2562 which I think I'll try next, but not at Amazon's full price of $300. I think you can pick it up here from a 3rd party for $185."
3,"love the phone, but there isn't a way to intercom corded base","I love my new phone system with the exception of two things: 1) I can't use a handset to intercom the main phone station. All the handsets will allow me to speak over a monitor to one another, but not the corded handset so I have to call the set with a pager noise and wait for a pick-up; 2) The pre-recorded tunes used for individual ringer choices stink (even worse than most cell phone rings that come stock with a phone.) The reception is great, even when I call from our house to the metal shop 200 feet away."
4,a great place to begin a study of Baptist theology,"I read this book as a student at New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary. The book is a concise, general overview of Baptist doctrine. It is a good book for those investigating the differences between Baptists and other denominations. It doesn't get 5 stars because it is a little too simple to be outstanding, although that's what makes it easy to read."
4,"SOLID HOUSE RELEASE, GREAT VALUE FOR YOUR $$$","Like the acclaimed HED KANDI CD series, this STEREO SUSHI provides more bang for your buck, collecting otherwise hard-to-find and costly $$ import house 12's onto CD format for the first time - many many stunning, lush, deep, rich house tracks to choose from, but WORTH THE PRICE OF ADMISSION if only for the uplifting BLAZE SHELTER VOCAL MIX of JAMAICA UNDERGROUND's gospel house anthem LOVE EXISTING, where new vocalist JOHN LEWIS (who is this guy?!) gives a truly SEARING, RAW, INTENSE vocal/falsetto/scat vocal performance - right up there with CECE ROGERS, KENNY BOBIEN, and TEN CITY'S BYRON STINGILY, if this track doesn't get your hands in the air, you don't have a pulse.BOOM!"
3,Pieces of a Dream is good but forgettable.,"I have always had mixed feelings about this band. They are very good musicians. There songs are romantic and relaxing. Everything you would expect from a good band. The problem is that at the end of the evening, you can not remember anything about what you just heard. It all just flows thru you and then it gone."
4,Good talk,This cd is as good as the last Pieces of a Dream release. This group stays fresh and entertaining.
3,Ultra Anatomically Correct Dogs Throw a Party,"Madame Coco lives with her five personified dogs, and during a long rainy spell, they throw a costume party to occupy the puppies' restless paws and prevent them from further ravaging the house. A fun time is had by all.This is a cute, albeit somewhat mediocre, story that kids would have a lot of fun reading. It would be great for beginning readers since there are rarely more than two or three sentences per page. The illustrations are at the same time whimsical and earthy - whimsical because of the dogs' human behavior and earthy because of the dogs' blatantly animal characteristics.There is, however, a caveat for parents pertaining to the illustrations. The three female dogs have protruding nipples, and the two male dogs have prominent testicles. Although this could be easily overlooked, the focus of the picture on the second page is the dogs pooping and peeing, so be forewarned."
5,An informed study presenting the visionary perspective of the church and the religious ideals towards same-sex attraction,"Christian Faith And Same-Sex Attraction by Thomas Hopko (Dean Emeritus of St. Vladimir's Seminar) is an informed study presenting the visionary perspective of the church and the religious ideals towards same-sex attraction. Clearly defining theological and pastoral insights concerning the experience of same-sex-desires and acknowledgements, Christian Faith And Same-Sex Attraction analyses the nature of gender identity and sexuality through the perspective of Christian Orthodox theology and is very strongly recommended reading for members of the Orthodox Christian church seeking to understand the theological doctrines relative to the issues of same-sex attractions experienced by themselves and/or their friends."
2,good point,this was an okay book and i feel that it had a good meaning too. But may be hard for some people to understand what it really meant.
1,Waste of time,"I have just passed 70-219 , down to the lack of available material I purchased this study guide. I found that the only chapter that was any use is 11 the rest of the book is basically business talk, I found most of it irrelevant to the exam topics. In my opinion this book will not teach you enough to pass the exam although it will give you an overview of the subject. My advice is do not waste your money on this book I used the Microsoft official course notes and the Windows 2000 resource kit which is by far a better purchase and will give you enough insight to start tackling exam scenarios. This book is not indepth enough it does not cover the technical objectives. I would like to point out one thing, no book alone will help you pass this exam, you need a lot of practical hands on real world exposure to WIndows 2000 in order to pass, in my opinion this book will not give it to you. I would use it as an introduction to the technology's not as a study guide"
4,Solid,"Haven't taken the test yet, but this is the first time studying for a MS test that I feel I've gotten something new out of preparation.Overall, the book is solid, it covers the information required, and I think I'm well prepared for the test.However, there are a few annoyances. Many of the review questions are ambiguously written. The test software refers to case studies in the book and doesn't give them in the context of the question."
2,Disappointing,"I have used the New Riders MCSE study guides all the way through my MCSE study preparation, usually in conjunction with the Coriolis Exam Cram series. I found this book to be very light on technical content, and to contain several errors. This is very annoying and confusing when you do not know enough about a subject to be sure that you have just discovered an error. I am currently looking for additional study material for exam 70-219 as I do not feel confident after reading this book. This is a good general introduction to AD design, but look elsewhere for substance. The Exam Gear test questions do not seem anywhere near as challenging as the Microsoft Test PEP questions that I have purchased, which leads me to further doubt the content of this book."
2,"Not a good ""Training Guide""","I purchased these books for my MCSE course curriculum and was very disappointed . This book does very little to prepare students for the 70-219 exam. They find it very dry, and lacking in the implemtation and technical aspects of designing an AD infrastructure. This is more of a business application book, and would be good reading for consultants and network engineers with experience and the technical aspects already mastered."
2,"Boring,boring","I was so bored reading this, that I skimmed through most of it. To me, this book is something a counselor/therapist should have in their office to sit on their bookshelf, only to be opened when they have a particular patient coming in with an eating disorder, & they need to brush up on the problem before their session. If you are totally new to eating disorders, or you are a family member who is trying to understand a loved one with an e.d., then you may find this helpful. To those who have been struggling with their eating for a long time, this book probably won't be of much help. Definitely for people with no knowledge of eating disorders."
3,Not for me,"This was the first book I ever read to try and combat my binge eating behavior that has been present for about seven years. I saw myself in all of the symptoms, but when I tried the program it almost made me more obsessed with food. Plus, I couldn't keep up with the ""schedule"" with my lifestyle. I understand that schedules are crucial for anorexics but for me it was not the answer. I have since read Intuitive Eating and I highly recommend that for anyone who has tried to stop binge eating and eating emotionally."
5,Very usable book,"As a professional in this field, I am always searching for useful, user-friendly tools. Once I find them, I keep them in my office to give to my patients. I find that sometimes it's even too much work to purchase a book. I found this extremely readable and relatable to folks with eating disorder. I rarely use medication alone and this has been a very helpful adjunct and I now keep extra copies in my office."
5,Would certainly Buy from seller again.,"The books very informative, helpful, and a great starting point (and possibly a cure for many). Great read, worth much more than price."
4,Not Alone,"This book made me realize that I wasn't the only one facing this problem -secretly- .Its a way of conforming what you think, see and feel and realizing that you aren't the only one.I say buy it, if you think somethings going wrong"
5,quick fix,The rollaway cot solved my problem of a much needed place tp sleep when my son comes over the house to stay for a few days. The cot is holding up and has not given any problems. I recommend for a temporary bedding or over night. My son has slept well on it and has not given any complaints about it. He gets a good's night rest and wakes up with out any pain. It is a quick fix for a temporary propblem.
4,Rollaway pleased!,"I searched locally for a comparable bed, and price, found the best deal on Amazon!"
1,cheap,"This is not an expensive bed, but I've had it for about a year and all the metal pieces that stop the legs from swinging broke off after a few uses. This makes it collapse when someone sits on it. I've got to throw it out. Disappointing."
2,Roll away bed,"This bed is extremely uncomfortable-the mattress sinks in the middle which makes the sides roll up over the occupant. It was necessary for me to add a dense foam mattress. I do not recommend this item at all, I was very disappointed. Thank you for allowing me to express my displeasure."
2,Problems with this bed,"By my measurement, this bed is only 72&quot; long. Also I couldn't get the 5/16&quot; threaded posts of the casters throught the metal tubing of the bed. Using 1/4&quot; screws, I could connect the metal cross-ties [Why is this critical piece missing from the picture?], but this left a 2&quot; sag in the middle of the bed. The mattress is a bit soft for my taste, but seemed OK."
1,better to sleep on the floor,the mattress is so flimsy it feels like you are laying on the metal frame.
3,Good for limited space,"It's not a heavy weight bed,good for a small child and where space is limited."
2,Gross,"Because of limited funds, I purchased a USEd rolloway bed - Never again..The mattress was foul, torn and just a mess - never again. it cost me a fortune to send it back.. Lesson learned, don' t buy used anything from this person.."
3,Nice package but ...,"Although the packing was very pleasant, it did not protect the shipment and two of my mugs arrived broken. I have to say that both remaining they are precious (Rose and Thinking Flower)"
4,Great example of the best of the 80's R&B synth styled music.,Takes you back. One of the best artist's of the period. V. Good collection!
3,Greatest Hits (Alexander O'Neal),Personal Preference of Artist. I think I could have done without the fast tunes.
3,Amazing Complation although it's missing Sunshine,"Alexander O'Neal along with Tony Terry, Chuckii Booker, David Peasotn and countless others were prince's in eighties R&B, when it was more about love and less about sex. With the production of the amazing Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis, Alexander is in top form on the tracks If You Were Here Tonight, Heresay,Saturday Love and Never Knew Love Like This. My only compliant about the CD is it lacks Sunshine. R.Kelly needs to takes notes from from this man,because at the end of the day it's more about pure vocal ability and less about some damn Trapped In The Closet Series."
3,"Intersting, but I always nerds were kinky.","A odd assortment both in content and quality is this collection of short science fiction. The one story that stands out above the crowd is ""Auto Erotica"" about cars as substitutes for sex or a form of foreplay in the future. Beyond this story however, I did not find the others particularly arousing or memoriable."
3,"NOT for big ""hard-reclining"" men!","CON: Relative angles don't change with position changes, so upright position is actually a weird ""upright-reclining"" position: Head & feet are unnaturally forward. PRO: The design is much simpler than traditional recliners, less prone to mechanical malfunctions. PRO: To me, this looks much more attractive than traditional recliners. CON: Big guys who squirm & stretch in their sleep while reclining can break this chair. I know, I did."
3,Warranty Concerns,"Human Touch Perfect Chair with Electric Recline and Folding Footrest - Red Bonded PC-085-100-010This is just an addendum to the reviews claiming no moving parts and therefore no worries about warranty. Love my chair, but it was apparently one of the last manual ones before they went to electric. The aluminum lever which releases the brake and allows reclining has just broken at its poorly-designed, weakest spot. I contacted Human Touch and they say that parts are no longer available. So, unless I can fabricate a substitute release lever, my chair investment has become worthless. I haven't examined the electric version of the chair, but I have to believe it has greater complexity than the manual version and has more potential to someday malfunction.I loved the chair for comfort, but beware of potential problems."
2,Somewhat of a DUDD!,"When this arrived, sealed in it's original package, it would not work. Even after trying fresh, brand new batteries it still didn't work. My 36 yr old son finally made some kind of adjustment and got it to work. It is not something I would recommend to anyone who does not have a technically advanced individual around to help if it doesn't work right."
5,Love it!,So far this car seat has been great...it is easy to adjust and the infant insert is great and very comfortable for our month old son. Highly recommended!
3,"Love That Baby, without this book maybe","This is a cute book with close up illustrations of babies, and the lifting the flap feature has its draws, but the very first page says that when babies are napping you should wake them. AHHHH I don't want my toddler thinking that is what he should do to napping babies. Besides that, the book is cute with pastel colors and with a theme of love."
1,This is BEYOND sloooow service!,"one month later and I still don't have it! Talk about SLOW service, not to mention totally unacceptable. I would never buy from this company again."
3,Multiple unsealed packages and damaged items,"I have never written a review before, but felt compelled to do so after receiving this item in an unsatisfactory condition. I enjoy Chaos and have nothing but good things to say about the product. In fact, I'd rate the PRODUCT with ""5 stars,"" but I'd rate my EXPERIENCE with Amazon's shipping, quality assurance, and customer service with ""1 star,"" so I gave an average of ""3 stars"" for this review.When I received my shipment, over a dozen of the 24 bags arrived unsealed (perhaps not enough adhesive on the bag?) As a result, the product arrived stale, with loose pieces of Chaos all over the box. Some of the bags seemed to be damaged (punctured) from shipping, but I was surprised by how many of the bags were simply unsealed.Sure, I could return the box for a refund or replacement, but what's the point of ordering groceries online if they arrive in such unsatisfactory condition? Doesn't anyone inspect the quality of the products leaving the warehouse?"
4,Great stuff,"If you're looking to get a taste of a variety of their snacks, this is a good place to start. The 2-ounce bags are a great portable size to toss in your bag, your kid's school lunches, etc. It has a nice blend of pretzels, corn chips, caramel popcorn, smart puffs (their version of crunchy cheetos), and blue chips. Although, in my case, the majority seemed to be mostly pretzels and corn chips. Overall, the flavors are nice and light -- a good balance of sweet and salty by adding the caramel popcorn. And the best snacks in the blend being their caramel popcorn and smart puffs."
5,Perfect Snack Mix!,"You'll never get tired of Chaos! It's got a great mixture of corn chips, blue tortilla chips, cheese curls, potato crisps, pretzels, and the best caramel corn ever! Organic and healthy!"
1,"""Chaos"" is right! Packaging was terrible!","I was so disappointed to receive the delivery! About 1/3 of the snack bags were opened and the snacks were spilled all over the box. I ordered other snacks from other companies without any problems. This box looked recycled and not very sturdy at all. The snack bags were just thrown in the large box, no packing material included. I ordered ""chaos"" pretzel snacks, and that was the condition they were received. I'm better off buying them from a retailer. I don't recommend ordering from them."
3,Kids love it,"The children love this blend....notfor an adults, we always though that this brand was a ""healthy"" alternative to other snacks, but they aren't, too sweet."
3,Fun for awhile,"I enjoyed Ultima Online immensely when I first started playing over two years ago. There is a wide variety of activities in which your character can participate including spell casting, tailoring, blacksmithing and joining a guild. The world is large and diverse and it's fun to interact with real people from all over the world. Player killers can be an annoying inconvenience if you enjoy traveling outside of towns but luckily aren't too numerous. In my opinion, money is too easily obtained making items worth very little. You can literally gate travel or 'recall' from bank to bank, city to city, picking up items dropped by other characters and make a profitable living! Also, the graphics, although attractive, are now outdated. My experience with online GM help was very positive, unlike the horror stories I was told. In conclusion, this game was fun for awhile but lost it's appeal over time. Then again, that can be said about most games, right?"
5,You want to join another world?,"Here's your chance. To become part of a growing universe of the alter-ego's.You can have many different characters, on a variety of servers..Which in turn = major diversity and opportunity.This is all about living another 'hero, thief, warlock, average joe' life..and its done well. Down to the details: writing a book, cooking food, making clothes, working for a living, buying a house, slaying monsters, finding treasure...the list goes on.Its also a beautiful reminder of the many Ultima games that graced the software age. Buy this game and leave your regular for awhile. It's like a vacation from you...(also recommended, Ultima Collection)"
1,I Needed to Gargle to get the bad taste out of my mouth,"This game is awful. On a 56k modem, the game paused about every three steps to load what everyone else did. The controls are numerous and confusing. It is hard to start, and nobody will stop running around like idiots for a second to answer a simple question. It is also easy to get lost and the game has no point. An all around bad game."
5,Excellent piece of steel!,"The order took 2 months to fulfill, but knew going into it about the length of time. Once shipped it arrived promptly. It arrived in fantastic condition, well oiled and VERY sharp! Well worth the wait. Very satisfied. Have never been let down by Cold Steel!"
2,Brilliant Drawings &#65533; Weak Text,"The third release in the Morbus Gravis series - Creatura - is pretty hollow. The text is very poorly written, also because the countless effect possibilities of a comic are not at all exploited concerning the text. This makes the text clumsy and hollow.The story is just OK. Nearly surrealistic in its playing around with reality and dream (without comparing to Milo Manara's genius in this area! ), and with past, present and future which however is taken on much too lightly.And the drawings are, as always from Serpieri's hand, frighteningly fantastic! But they ARE also the highlight of this comic book. Only should the artist have added more sex, and more explicit sex, to compensate for the poor story."
5,Love that Shamus slang,Fire up a gasper. Break out our flask and prepare to get smacked with the politically incorrect descriptions of the colorful inhabitants of 1930's southern California. Pure ESCAPISM. Just enjoy.Keep a roscoe handy. just in case.
4,Great drill,So far I have to say it's an excellent drill and would recommend it to any one. Only bad thing I have to say about it is the crappy case they give you.
3,"Functional, but with some issues","I ordered these to low-pass the signal from my preamp to my sub amp (which does not have a crossover, just a big amp). My preamp has two outputs for the main. Unfortunately, because these are passive devices, they affected the sound going to my main amp and speakers. I ended up having to put another preamp (old Radio Shack mixer) before the crossover to give the isolation. In this mode, I set the mixer to mono and I only use one. In some ways this is a blessing, because I have a gain control on just the sub-woofer system now to balance out the sound (my main amp is 700+ Watts, while my sub is only 400 Watts). I'm sure in a more traditional installation, or one in which the outputs are buffered, these work fine."
5,Works great as advertised,Needed an easy to install out of the way cross over w/o adding a bunch of wire and more box's. This fit the bill perfectly for my mids. Good bass with no vibrations or noise.
3,UCO Candelier Candle Lantern Deluxe Kit,"Ordered the UCO Candlelier Candle Lantern Deluxe Kit plus 3 additional 3 candle packages and a reflecter: ordered a blue padded case, received a black padded case... I could have lived with this but, the padded case was so tight I had to cut it off with a razer blade... Had two of my camping buddies working with me for over 1 1/2 hours but the case was to tight to slide off... E-Mailed UCO direct and they have not answered..."
2,The Bag doesn't Fit! Save money and get just the lantern.,"The carry case is a good idea but it took me ten minutes to peel it off the lantern. I was concerned about the breaking the glass the entire time, and the top cuff actually started pulling away from the case. After I got the lantern out, I discovered that the case is the perfect fit for the lantern IF the handle is not down in the case. With the handle up, it slides in and out without stress.The tag says Quality Guaranteed. I'll email the manufacturer tomorrow to find out what Quality Guaranteed actually means."
5,Excellent!,This book is very specific about the individual characters you'll find in a sitcom. Really gives great insight and tips for playing these types of roles on tv! Scott truly is the 'sitcom guru'!
4,Very informative.,"This book helped me to see that my comedy comes from three of the eight characters of comedy. Now I can focus my efforts in those areas to write better jokes and perform better stand-up comedy. The book was geared more towards actors than writers but it is pretty universal if you understand the concepts. I would recommend this book to any student of comedy, actor, writer, or stand-up comedian."
3,"great info, but could be done in 10 pages","a whole book, this does not need, but the information is still valuable. It's drawn out to fill the pages to be sure, but the core ideas are worth going back to from time to time. If it was a just a few reference cards, it'd be a great writing tool. As is, it's a bit unwieldy."
5,An excellent resource,"The book provides an excellent resource for anyone writing comedic material, whether sitcom based or not. These characters are timeless."
5,Great Shoes,"Had these shoes like four years ago and I had to get them again. Great for walking and I find them very stylish. What I really like is that the insoles are so cushy and soft. They're pretty comfy if you're feet are usually hurting. Only thing is that because they are white leather, they get dirty pretty easily."
5,great experience!,Super fast shipment on these shoes. Great quality. I have another pair the is 3 years old and still in great condition. I walk on cement floors all day and my feet feel great. Would buy this product from this seller again and recommend to others.
5,Best Sneaker,The Reebok Classic has always served me well as a walking shoe and gym shoe. Amazon came through when I couldn't buy the shoes locally.
5,Can't lick the white kicks,"Good ol' Reebok classics are tough to beat in my book. Cheap, durable, comfortable, easy to clean, can be worn for almost any occasion and pretty sleek looking: what more could you ask for? Plus, the babes always love a dude in white kicks. Dig 'em."
1,disappointed,"Poor quality shoe, especially for the money. I say move on and do not buy this product."
5,Fun and responsibility all in one,"My daughter received Money and Me as a birthday present, and it was her favorite right away. She already has a babysitting business, and this journal will really help her get organized. She loves the calculator, too."
5,Loads of Power,"After a few weeks of work from this addition to the shop I like it a lot.I have worn out two Porter Cable sanders,one Dewalt. I also have Makita unit that is still going strong, and hope the best for this new addition. It seems to have more power that the others, and that's not a huge deal maybe for finish sanding, but it ""feel"" better. The dust collection end is acceptable, and I expect it to be more rugged that the Dewalt, but it still has some dust leaks. The dust collector is very easy to clean.The component that will wear out that controls start up sanding speed is some of a concern, and the documentation didn't clearly tell me where I can get some back up supply (and I know I'll need them)"
1,works for awhile,Bought two of these based on recommendations from others. I am a boat builder and use these sanders three days/week. First the hook pads went out on them requiring new ones at $20/each after 6mos usage. Then the motor on one went out requiring replacement in the warranty period. Can't use either of them now and they will both require repair. They worked great while they lasted but didn't last too long.
2,Random Orbit?,After six months of ownership and less than daily use this sander doesn't random orbit until it is pressed down onto the workpiece. The problem with this is that every time you start to sand it digs in and essentially grinds the surface. It also means that any time you sand around a corner or over an edge and uneven pressure is applied the disc spins freely and grinds instead of orbiting. My old Makita BO1050 didn't start to do this until near the end of its long and hard used life. We have had similar problems with several very new Rigid and Ryobi sanders at work. I hate to think that Bosch is in the same category as those brands. I should have stuck with Makita.
3,Lots O' Tools,"I like thise palm sander, however, the electrical cord has disintegrated over time (about 4 years). My Bosch router which has shared the tool cabinet with the palm sander has had no such problems. The cord on the router is still pliable and like new while the palm sander's cord has hardened and cracked apart every inch or so."
3,"works great, dust collection?","The sander works great, light weight, comfortable in the hand, and a smooth finish.... As far as dust collection, well there is a filter on the sander but I think it just for looks or maybe I have to read the instructions again to see If I am doing something wrong because it doesn't pick up any dust at all. For that I only gave it 3 stars."
1,Paper weight,"I have many Bosch tools, some good and some okay. I bought two of these sanders at the same time to replace two DeWalt sanders that were used almost daily for over a year. The dust collection works well, for about 5 minutes until the pleats in the filter clog, then you might as well take it off at least the board will be dust free. Then after about three days of sanding drawer boxes and doors with no heavier than 80-grit discs the hook and loop pad wouldn't even hold a new disc. After calling Bosch and pleading my case they did send me two new pads free of charge. To the credit of truth in advertising, the box did say, ""Lasts 5x Longer""; resulting in almost 15 days of use. Other than the case they came in, they are worth, well, about nothing. Spend the extra money on a Metabo or Festool and you'll actually save money with the extra hours spent in service. The only reason for one star is because I can't post the review with no stars!"
4,Very good sander,"I bought this last month. It does an excellent job, but the dust collection leaves a bit to be desired. First off, you have to buy an adaptor from a non-Amazon source. With shipping, this will be in the $10 range. Since that adaptor works only with the Bosch vacuum hoses, us plebes need an adaptor for the adaptor to hook in up to the regular hose. That runs another $10 at Lowes, and the two adaptors make sanding a two-handed proposition.Even with this and a 450 CFM dust collector, you still wind up with a coating of dust on the sander and table. I've read that the Porter-Cable 333 VS is better in this regard and plugs right in to a shop vac hose."
5,Excellent Random Orbit Sander,"I traded up from a Ryobi sander. This sander is more agressive without leaving swirl marks. Like all built in dust collection, it's not perfect. With the bag expect 50-60% dust capture. With a vacuum attached, 75-80%."
2,Should last more then a month trouble free,With less than a month of use this sander stopped working. I wound up having to drive it over to the local authorized service center where they replaced the armature - so even though I bought a new sander I now have the equivalent of a refurbished one. I'm not at all happy with Bosch's quality.
2,Try something else,I bought 2 of these mainly for the name I had not used one before. Not very happy with it. The dust canister leaks like a seive.It is pretty much useless for dust collection and it is hard to get the latches to stay closed and it falls off sometimes. the sanding pad for some reason only cuts at the edge of the pad. It is like the pad is cupped it also vibrates more than the Makita or Dewalt I have used. I won't buy this brand again.
5,Absolutely Perfect,This is without doubt the perfect version of the Pearl Fishers. The superb Lamoureux conducted by its founder Jean Fournet creates Bizet's opera in splendid form. A treasure!
3,Missing libretto,I was very disappointed to receive the opera without a libretto. One should be able to assume that the libretto is included with the recording as has been standard practice for decades. The product description should specify when the libretto is not included.
3,Not what I expected,The main reason for checking out this album was because I heard two Dimmu Borgir (Norwegian black metal band) songs in the trailer of the movie. I am rather disappointed to not find them on the soundtrack.
5,A new classic emerges from an exciting new composer!,"Marco Beltrami is a very interesting artist, indeed...Possessing a style that is unique in it's approach to harmony, dissonance, and the mating of electronic elements with symphonic,Marco is quickly establishing himself as someone who not only has a strong individual voice, but knows how to build on the strengths of his forbearers.Hellboy is a phenomenal piece of composition. Highly memorable, and addicting like the best kind of drug, the score brilliantly transitions from epic thematic material, to quiet and emotional motifs that bring a deep level of heart and power to the film.The film and the score are masterworks in the genre and should beexperienced by any who love great film, and great music.Cheers Marco, you've arrived with this one!Ben Isaac"
5,"""Stoddard Nailed It""","I have most likely read almost every book that has been written about the legendery college football coach. With the possible exception of ""Bear"", (which was an autobiography written by John Underwood) this is the best book ever written on Paul ""Bear"" Bryant. It was meticulously researched and led the reader on a journey throughout the year of 1958 (Bryant's first year at Alabama) which laid the foundation for a football dynasty during the 1960s and 1970s. While books like ""The Junction Boys"" might be more entertaining (but not always factual), ""Turnaround"" does not suffer the numerous embellishment problems that ""Junction"" did. Tom Stoddard deserves a great deal of recognition for this work. It is a must for the serious student of Bryant."
1,"Save your money and read ""The Junction boys""","The Junction Boys is one of the best sports books I've ever read. It goes into great detail about Paul Bryant's first year at Texas A&M. This book is a cheap ripoff. It doesn't give much detail into anything. Each game is covered in about two or three pages, and there's nothing memorable. As a Tide fan, I took the bait and bought this book, don't bother."
2,Buyer Beware beware,"These poems are very endearing the book is nice but ... Poetry Dot Com sells the books buy telling poets they will be included in the book. Then, this company sells the customer books with their poem on the first page. The only copies with their poem included are the copies they bought ... so every book has differant poem on the first page. BEWARE if you are looking for someone's poem!"
4,Love The Music But Not the CD Company,"I have bought every cd by Maddy Prior and the Carnival Band that I have been able to find except this ser. I love everyone I have. But of the 22 titles on these cd's, 10 appear on the same artists' ""Carols at Christmas"", ""Carols & Capers"" and/or ""Gold Frankincense & Myrrh"" . 12 apparently do not appear on those discs. Remember, however, that in traditional British music, the same music often has a number of different titles (""The World Turned Upside Down"" vs ""When the King Comes Into His Own Again "" for you Yorktown students, for example.) I think that failure to disclose this duplication is a bit deceptive on the part of the cd maker. But if you can't find all 3 of the cd's I mention - or are willing to take the chance that there are 12 previously unavailable pieces - it may be worth it to you."
2,Nothing Spectacular,"The greatest irony of this book is the fact that the most prominent portrait of the collection is not Japlish at all. The ""Racism Sucks"" t-shirt on the front cover is actually a famous t-shirt design from the American ska band Fishbone. This mistake illustrates the problem with this book: A lack of understanding of the English-speaking culture of the audience. This book does not communicate enough to American audiences. Having lived in Japan, I think that the photographs do capture the Japanese youth, their Japlish-covered clothing, and the interesting messages and interactions that these clothes have with the wearers and the social environments. However, the photographs have few other qualities. They are not very aesthetically pleasing. The composition of the entire book lacks order and meaning. I didn't feel like any message was communicated adequately after looking through this book. It was interesting to look through once, but not worth its price."
2,Not My Cup of Tea,"I caught a few songs by Marvin on cable and wanted to hear more. I'm a baby-boomer who loves surf guitar and who has a soft spot in his heart for instrumentals. Unfortunately, this compilation was unfulfilling more applicable as elevator music than serious ear candy. While technically proficient, the music is painfully lacking in flair and innovation."
5,nice release from Silva,"As with most of the recent Silva America releases, Silva Screen has compiled older recordings from previous CDs and added some new material exclusively for this release. In this case, Silva has recorded music from The first Harry Potter and Lord of The Rings films, both Mummy films and Gladiator. I'm not sure what else is new, but combine these excellent tracks with golden age material from Hermann and Rozsa, and some Elfman (Batman, Edward Scissorhands) and Williams (Raiders of the Lost Ark, Witches of Eastwick) for good measure, you have a heckuva compilation.The performance is first rate with only the Raiders March being a subpar track."
4,The Fantasy Album,You can't have too many Sci-Fi albums. This is a good addition to anyone's collection. A good crosssection of SF music. It even has music from The Thief of Bagdad from the 30s(?)
4,"The book shows the true man, but explict motives he killed.","The beginning starts out innocently as the book progresses the main character develops hypochondria. The mad-man falters, because of his guilt. What disturbs Rodia was not who he killed, but rather his guilt. The book depicts a killer and the true stuff what the soul is made of.comment on the authors philosophy in the book?"
2,Unmemorable,"Using the theme of patchwork quilts, and the various pieces that went to form them, Whitson weaves the story of Sarah Biddle, who is sent west on an orphan train with her crippled younger brother. They alight in Lincoln, Nebraska, where they are immediately accepted into the lives of hotel owners Jesse King and August Hathaway. Determined to make her own way in the world, Sarah takes a job, first as housekeeper-in-training for a wealthy mother and son, then as a private nurse for the local doctor. Along the way, she suffers enough heartbreak and hardship to force to the understanding that peace is only found through the saving grace of God.The story is decent, if unoriginal, but Whitson's amateurish writing bogs down from page one. An annoying habit of using direct address in nearly every line of dialogue, a leaning toward the melodramatic in her prose, and characters that are stiff and unnatural - all combine in a story that is unmemorable, at best."
5,"America's Love Doctor on ""Nobody Moved Your Cheese""","After reading Ron Shafer's ""Nobody Moved Your Cheese"" I thought he would be a great guest on my radio show. He was! Ron's wit and charm shine through in this book! His insights are crisp and provide motivation without the fluff we are all unwillingly subjected to."
5,What everyone is thinking but afraid to say,Ross's book is absolutely hilarious. I sent it to several of my friends because I knew they would love it too...AND they did...there are so many self help silly books out there and ross's book is a spoof on all of it...but the best part is he is on target and right...its an easy read and a GREAT gift!! The men I know all loved it and agreed 100% with his thoughts and comic way of presenting what we do all really think about some of the other books out there!!!
1,Rantings of a cynical hypocrite,"The author does the exact same thing he criticizes self-help gurus about (which is the the only point in the book). I found this book to be merely rantings of a cynical and bitter man. I thought he was crazy when he began to criticize the work of Jack Canfield. Jack Canfield's work is about people taking responsibility for their own lives, just in a unique approach - which works!"
2,Save your cheese,"The good news is that Ross Shafer doesn't take himself too seriously. The bad news is neither should you. He criticizes all of the pablum spouters on self help and then offers his own. I was hoping to get some down to earth materials to discuss in the workplace, but I'm afraid that there is not very much of substance in this book to use."
5,This book changed my life,"This was the first comprehensive book on Buddhism that I read and it had a profound impact on my life. I thoroughly recommend it to anybody starting out on the Mahayana Buddhist path or evaluating it. This book covers all the essentials. While most of the thoughts are from a Nyingma point of view, I really don' think it really matters even if you are more of a Gelug, Sakya or Kagyu...The book is written in a very down to earth manner and considering that the subject it tackles is mostly esoteric it does a brilliant job. There are numerous day-to-day examples and illustrations from the lives of Buddhist saints which are used to drive home the points. If you're going to buy only one book on Buddhism, make this the one..."
4,Works just fine,I am using this for my small bunny. She doesn't have any problem with it. I have a divided cage so it is inside the actual cage. If it were on the outside it would be really messy. The hooks work but it yould be better if it locked on or was more sturdy. Most animals like to play with everything so all they have to do is push it up a little and it will fall off. The one that I got was purple.
2,A large percent falls outside of the cage...,"The more my guinea pig ate, the more that would fall outside of the cage. Since the reviews for this hayrack are pretty good, I might have had a defective unit. But anyways I would recommend (Super Pet Hay n Food Bin Feeder with Quick Locks, Colors May Vary)over this"
1,Cheap and disappointing!,"The gun broke the same day we received it, after NORMAL PLAY! Company would not take back, even for an exchange. Be aware of their policy of exchange/return policy on items only arriving defectively--not proving defective after using it for a few minutes! Cheap products, bad customer service, Century Novelty. One very disappointed boy who saved his money for pirate gear and almost all of it broke from this company!!"
3,This book is good for what it is intended for.,"The book covers programming in C++, but it should not be used as a book for newcomers to programming. They should read C++ for dummies! This is basically a college text-book and needs to be used with professional instruction."
1,The book isn't good for learning c++,"Firstly, a lot of the syntaxes and programmes do not work.- The book does not offer any significantly good explanation.- I would prevent any novice from reading the book because it it nothing but junk. It is the junkies book I have ever read. What the book is good for is just to wipe my shoes on the door step"
1,Defective.,Both bulbs burnt out on activation.Eiko must have poor quality for Japanese made bulb.Had to buy OSRAM (made in mexico). OSRAM has a better looking filament and has not bunt out in the first 6 hours.Do you offer refunds?
5,Excellent CD,"""Giant Steps"" is probably my favorite song in all of jazz, and Buddy Rich's version here is one of the best that I've listened to. I would rank it up there with Coltrane's, although there are mistakes on the take here, such as where the vibe player begins his solo before the piano is done. I really like the way he harmonizes the melody for the sax section. If you are a jazz lover, I thouroughly recommend this CD for you."
3,"Ok drive, bad software","The software that came with the drive was terrible. The interface was impossible to use and I spent too much time figuring out how to do simple features like full screen, and windowed screen. The playback was pretty skippy, but I assume it's the software, I'm going to get myself PowerDVD 3 as soon as I get a chance.The description I found at Pacific Digital's website was not true, and the software does not let you view movies with 5.1 surround sound. The feature is not available. You can however use stereo... I was also upset reading the system requirements that said 350 mhz or better, but when I recieved the drive, it turned out that you needed 350 pentium or better, or 450 AMD or better.."
3,decent...for a while,"I bought this to play DVDs--nothing else. That it does. However, it's a little slow extracting audio and recently the tray started getting stuck when opening and closing."
3,Good for the money!,"This item has been installed in a yet to be ""burned in"" new computer. Installed well and seems to be okay with XP."
4,"A functional drive, but getting old","I have never had a problem with this product, although it is getting old now. Probably purchasing a newer drive would be better, but this is a good drive for a good price."
2,Silence is golden!,"This drive is a true noise maker. If you prefer drive noise,vibrations and whines while watching DVD's or playing anyother media than this is the one for you.I did not detect problems with dual layered DVD's but therewere some problems with playing the outer tracks of someAudio CD's.The drive color is a light off grey and not beige as one wouldthink. The drive tray was slightly misaligned and gave theimpression that all would break after a few months use as itmade clickity clackity noises while opening and closing.I found no value in its pricing and would recommend that anyoneconsidering a new DVD drive purchase one from the media giantssuch a Sony or Samsung whose quality and attention to detail willnever be matched by Pacific Digital..."
2,cheap but not always functional,"I've had this DVD drive for a year and a half now, and it does work most of the time (albeit with a terribly loud whirring noise that sometimes detracts from the movie) but I've found that it cannot detect some DVDs. They are perfectly legit home videos that work in other DVD-ROMs, but not in this one. So every once in a while I have to borrow someone else's DVD player just to watch a movie, which is a nuisance. It will probably be a better deal to buy a more expensive DVD-ROM drive that runs quietly and actually works all the time."
1,Locks up my computer all the time!!!,"This drive sucks. I paid (on sale at Staples) $115.00 And it has not worked well since the day I got it. It locks my computer up so bad, I cannot even shut it down!!! I have to hard power it down and as you know not shutting everything else down causes software problems... I have tried to find firmware upgrades for this drive and none can be found on internet. The front of the retail box (which I still have) brags about Toll Free Technical Support.... uh... so what... someone answers the phone, they don't speak good english and they can't help me. Last Pacific Digital Product I am ever going to buy. Stick with name brands... Plextor, Sony, both support their drives... even the older ones. Gee I am mad!!! I won't get fooled again!"
3,PACIFIC DIGITAL 16X DVD,THE DRIVE IS GOOD. INSTALLED PERFECTLY. THE SOFTWARE IS USELESS. I FOUND A COPY OF POWER DVD AND IT WORKS GREAT. I AM RUNNING WINDOWS XP.
1,DO NOT BUY PACIFIC DIGITAL PRODUCTS!!!,"I BOUGHT AN EXTERNAL CD BURNER FROM AN INTERNET SELLER. IT CAME BRAND NEW IN A SEALED BOX WITH ALL THE WARRANTY CARDS AND EVERYTHING. I AM HAVING TROUBLE INSTALLING IT SO I CALLED PACIFIC DIGITAL SEVERAL TIMES FOR HELP ONLY TO GET VOICEMAIL. MY EMAILS WERE NEVER ANSWERED EITHER. WHEN I FINALLY GOT THROUGH THEY TOLD ME I COULDN'T GET SUPPORT BECAUSE I BOUGHT FROM AN ""UNAUTHORIZED SELLER"" THAT IS UNCONSCIONABLE!!! THIS COMPANY WILL BE OUT OF BUSINESS SOON BECAUSE THEY DO NOT STAND BY WHAT THEY SELL."
4,IT'S ABOUT THE OVERWHELMING NEED TO CREATE -- EVEN WHEN FACING DEATH,"Over the years, the Ken Russell film I've thought about more than any other is the biographical portrait of French sculptor Henri Gaudier-Brzeska. Not a great film, but it burned itself into a deep place in my psyche. Perhaps it's because of the searingly intense portrayal of the innate need of true artists (and madmen?) to be creative. Gaudier-Brzeska fought in WW I; he received a decoration for bravery, but was killed in the trenches at Neuville-Saint-Vaast. During his time in the Army, he sculpted a figure out of the butt of a rifle taken from a German soldier. I will always remember that primitive carving. Even Helen Mirren's brave full frontal nudity takes a back seat -- well, almost -- to the art of Gaudier-Brzeska. Listen for the brilliant use of Claude Debussy's powerful music as part of the movie's fine score."
3,which format?,"I would love to see this film, which has never been widely available, at least in the U.S. However, although the Amazon copy says DVD, the price and the Warners Archive imprint are both indicative of those wretched DVD-Rs (generally the same quality you can burn off a TV transmission, at 25 times the cost). If anyone buys this, could you post a review that indicates the format. Thanks"
5,Great,"So what if is a DVD-R? I would be happy having a ten-year old VCR tape recording from TV.What I remember from 40 years ago in The Flick theatre is the great ending. Russell, in this period, was rather restrained."
2,They're OK... but...,"When I received the package, the box was a little damaged. I found one broken glass and decided to return the item. I would have kept the set since there was only one glass broken but I kind of thought the glasses would be slightly bigger than they actually are. I also thought they would not break easily."
5,A typical amazon purchase,"I liked the design on these glasses so I headed for the reviews. I noticed two things. They came broken, They were easily breakable. The packaging was excellent also noticed they came from Target Inc. and the glasses aren't that easily breakable. Four of each of the three sizes not bad for the price."
2,Broken glass,"The shipping container was completely inadequate for fragile glassware, and one of the iced tea glasses was broken. I kept the rest of the set anyway because it was relatively inexpensive and I needed the glasses. Other than that, it's a cute pattern and I like the juice sized glasses in particular. Shipping problem, not necessarily product problem."
3,They chip easily,I really like the design of these and they were great at first but then they started chipping at the top and I have thrown a few away already... I would buy better quality next time.
5,Glassware,Glasses arrived on time an where well packed. The recipient of this glass set said that they are thicker and heavier than most and that they should last a long time.
4,Easy for kids to build!,This is very easy for young children to build with the assistance of an adult. The holes are predrilled so only a hammer is required.
4,Worthwhile purchase,"I purchased this as a birthday present for my 5 yr. old granddaughter. It came exactly as represented. My husband helped her put it together. He said with a little help she was able to put it together. The only drawback was the nails were rather short. He was afraid it wouldn't hold up for a very long time, so... he also added some longer screws to it to make it a little more longlasting. Even with this shortcoming I would definitely buy it again."
2,Pine-Pro Hobby Express Bird House Kit,This bird house kit is very cheep quality. I would defiantly not recommend this to anyone. The wood is very thin and it seems fragile.
4,Good value,"I bought this for my son in 2004 and it does the job nicely. He doesn't care about hi-fidelity, so sound and picture quality isn't an issue. He has dropped the player a few times, but it survived. Overall I'm happy with it. It comes in handy when one kid wants to watch one show and the other wants to watch a movie."
1,"Nice out of box, terrible quality",This DVD player looks great on paper and worked great for us...for about 20 videos of use. It just stopped working. I have read many other user reviews (mostly on CNET.com) of product failure. Think twice before choosing this poor quality machine.
2,Good when it works,"I had this for 6 months before it stopped working in the middle of a movie. Wouldn't work at all. I called customer service and, after repeated attempts, eventually got through to them. To say that they weren't helpful would be a huge understatement, they actually directed me to buy a lens cleaner to see if that was the problem. It wasn't. They then told me it would be over $100 to repair. Instead, I opened it up myself and manually ""fixed"" it in about 5 minutes. Now it works great.Will never buy from Go Video again though."
4,Go Video GP 8440,"I've had this product for 1 week and love it. I also got the DP110TV accessory and it works great at my house and work. You can scan in your local channels from the supplied antenna (which I do at work) or connect it to your cable system (which I do at home) and both have fine reception. The remote control works all functions and you can switch between TV and DVD with a touch of the finger. Once you scan in your local programs, you can then use the remote to just switch between those and not worry about any others. Even after you scan the channels, the remote lets you Fine Tune the frequency if it is off a notch.The sound is adequate from the intenal speakers and very good from an attached headset.The picture quality is great and you can adjust to regular or 16.1 with ease."
2,Don't Believe the Hype!,"For those of you who are into the specs of a product, this looks like a real good buy. But there are major drawbacks to this product. The first being there is a separate battery compartment that attaches to the actual unit itself. This makes it noticibly more cumbersum to carry. The unit itself is light, but the separate battery compartment makes it feel like your now carrying a laptop. The tv tuner is also almost impossible to find to purchase, and if you do find it, good luck with trying to find a channel to watch. The picture is horrible with the antennae. And lastly, the picture on this is pretty dark. So don't get caught up in the specs, or the size, go with a better quality picture over the specs."
2,watch out the warranty service,The warranty for this product is 3 months parts and labor and a year for parts only. I just paid $97 for the labor to get mine replaced (refurbished unit) which is half of the cost of a new one. What a service!
1,DONT BUY THIS!!!!! STAY AWAY FROM GO VIDEO!!!,the unit started malfunctioning shortly after it arrived. the display was faulty and couldnt see anything on it.but it gets worse!WHAT A LOUSY CUSTOMER SERVICE!.calling the 800 number is playing russian roulette.good luck if hold time doesnt exceed less than 20 minutes.i had the unit replaced for one of lesser value!now still waiting for the right one.3 months and counting.it is not worth my time to spend such long hours calling them.ENTER AT YOUR OWN RISK should be their logo.
5,"A ""must"" for all syptic system owners.","The basics of septic systems, from underground systems and failures to what the owner can do to promote and maintain a healthy system, is revealed in an excellent guide essential for any who reside on a septic system. Rural residents receive a primer on not only the basics; but how to conduct period inspections and what to do when things go wrong. History also figures into the fine coverage."
3,"good basic info, short on troubleshooting","If you want to know what are the various kinds of septic systems and how they work, this is a good book. If you have a problem and want to know how to diagnose or solve it, you'll be disappointed. Overall message on how to maintain a septic system seems to be, ""the less you use it, the better."" Index is inadequate."
4,Good Read for septic system owners,"Informative with basic information for those who have or are new to the world of septic tank maintenance. Could save you lots of money and headache over the life of your tank.Fun chapter on history of waste disposal systems throughout the progress of civilization. Also, some political background if you are being forced to make a change in your system that works -- the septic tank. It's worth the price even though much of the information can also be found searching the Internet but who has that much time?"
3,Good read!,This is a good book for someone who has never had a spetic system. It was an easy read and I gave it to anothe friend who is building with septic and he loves it!
5,If you want Septic system knowledge this is the ticket,"This book is THE cookbook for septic systems. If you want to do it yourself or want to do your homework prior to having one put in or if you just want to know everything you wanted to know about septic systems but were afraid to ask, this is the book for you. It is well illustrated and easy to read and understand. I have put in several septic systems and have found this to be the best reference guide out there."
2,Septic System Manual - very elementary,"I bought this manual (New-Revised-Updated 2007 edition) based on the ravishing reviews I read. However, I found it to be very elementary and lacking in information on aerobic systems. There is also no discussion on use of chlorine tablets. If you are looking for a manual to help you with understanding your aerobic system, you may want to skip this."
1,Awfull performance,"This graphics card is the poorest performing card I've ever used. It is only one lane, but keep your expectations very low and you won't be disappointed."
1,very disappointing,"I purchased the 2"" cone, a great deal of soot when started, enough that it should be lite outside, have to continually restart, would not purchase from again"
5,does exactly what its supposed to,"This product works great. It is not oily, sprays nicely, and smells good, not too coconutty as so many are. I've used it before but today used it again at the beach from (approximately) 9AM to noon with no burn."
3,Great if you love the books/movie,"First off in you're not into the movie or the book series, there are better games out there. But if you are, I definetly suggest you get it.You have the ability to play as all four of the Pevensie children at the same time, each have speacial abilities that you need to complete different tasks and can switch back and forth between all of the children while in different levels. Another good thing about the game is that it gives you some space with playing it and allows you to explore the land and makes you think about what to do next. But it's not to hard, the game does give you some tips and helps you out along the way.It's also very fun(and sometimes easier) to play in the 2 player co-op mode. Grab a friend and go play!"
5,Awsome Game,This is a really cool game! Me and my sister love using Co-op modeIts kind of short though. Other than that its awsome.
3,Surprisingly thin material,"I was suprised to see how thin the material is when I received these cones. Although it serves the purpose of cones for drill, I cannot just drop it on field as I do with the heavier cones I have because it will be blown off the position I want even with breeze. I have to bend down to put each cone on the ground. Regardless, I have to say the cone serve its purpose and the holder is a really nice feature to carry the cones around."
4,Great for Coaching!,"I got these cones because i am a coach for U12 Field hockey, and they were an essential tool. The cones themselves held up to much abuse, (Players stepping on them, folding them inside out, etc) and allowed me to include drills using them. (jabbing drills, etc). The carrier wasn't exactly needed, but when i did use it, it was a huge help. If you're looking for cones that do the job and can stand up to the abuse of kid's playing with them, then these are what you're looking for. They all come in one gradient of orange, and are easy to see on any type of field."
5,Just what we needed,"We are barrel racers and rather than buying cones (nice ones are not cheap...) I bought these. They are really nice, bounce back when stepped on. They are not big, so they are more for the rider than for the horse, but we like them and they do exactly what we need."
5,"Perfect, Simple to store, Durable","These are exactly as described. The shallower cones like these are safer. If you want taller cones, think about being sure they're very soft. The only point in writing the review is to confirm that they are as described and durable. They're compact to store."
3,Incomplete work!,"First, the background:Those of you that are familiar with Daniel Rupp's ""History of Northampton, Lehigh, Monroe, Carbon and Schuylkill Counties"" you may know that the subscriber list in most copies of the book is incomplete. For example, there are no subscribers shown for Monroe County! However, there is a digital copy of this book on Ancestry.com that does include a few additional pages of the subscriber list that makes it complete or closer to being complete.Second, my review:I purchased this book because I hoped that the author would have put in substantial effort in locating a complete or near complete list of subscribers. To me this would be a requirement of putting together a book that specifically is an index to this list. Sadly, the author did no such thing. This index, in my opinion, is incomplete. However, I decided to be kind and recognize the work that the author did accomplish so I gave it 3 stars instead of even less."
3,OTHER SIZES FOR 5 STARS,I WOULD LIKE IT IF YOU GUYS WOULD GET THESES IN A SIZE 10 FOR MEN I REALLY WANT THSESE I USE TO OWN A PARIR BACK THEN NOW I CANT GET THEM IN MY SIZE
4,Another great Monk live CD,"This is a different concert than the, ""Monk in Tokyo"" CD by Sony. It was recorded at TBS-TV Studios, Tokyo, Japan, May 23, 1963. Musicians on this date were: Charlie Rouse, Thelonious Monk, Butch Warren, and Frankie Dunlop.Great audio quality and great playing! If you liked ""Monk in Italy"" and ""Monk in France"" you love this CD.This concert was also available as a laserdisc with excellent picture quality, unfortunately it is now out of print. You can see a clip of it in Clint Eastwood's Monk documentary, ""Just a Gigolo"" was taken from this concert.For some odd reason this concert is not being issued by a major label, could it be a boot? Availability is scarce I'm sure, so if you see it, don't hesitate buy it!"
3,just okay,read it ... interesting but shallow .. some stories are funny some are utterly boring but it's not a throwaway book
3,Sturdy,"The one bad part about this item is that the dry-erase comes off when it gets rubbed against by papers and such that are clipped to it. I don't know if there'd be a way to have a marker that was dry erase, but didn't come off as easy? Also it doesn't hold a pen very well. There isn't much space between the clamp and the board. I would have preferred being able to slide a pen in and out.On the plus side, so far this board has withstood stress bending quite a bit. I also may have left a few bite marks in it during playoffs.One more thing, the board is longer than I expected it to be. Longer than most clipboards. Still fits in my coaching case though."
5,The World as it Ought to Be,"Sic Itur Ad Astra is the most advanced set of ideas about Economics and Social Science (in the truest sense of that term) to be published so far. It is an exposition of how the world works and how it ought to work, based on scientific reasoning. If this sounds dry, it is anything but! It is entertaining, packed with examples and simple references to everyday life with a clarity which will astound you. These ideas have changed my life in a very positive way, and brought much happiness in knowing much more about what is happening, and also a very focused view of a positive future for mankind. It is Fun, Educational, and Important!"
3,short stories = quick reads when busy,The stories were quite interesting and a few really caught my attention. I had to keep reminding myself though that these were fairy tales and so the endings weren't always what I had hoped or expected.
3,For collectors only,This toy is so small that it has very little play value. The only thing the toy is for is collectors or those who make diaramas.
3,SMALL,"This shark is really small! I thought it would be a little bigger for the price, but my 2 year old still loves them."
2,omar,nd the pictures are misleading.It is smaller than the pictures and not very detailed.The price is too high.I would not recommend
2,Did not like,Did not like the book. It seems to clash with my christian belief. But at least it gave me an idea of what cabala is.
3,Not bad but too Trancey,"I LOVE Happy Hardcore. I throw events for HHC, I make HHC music, and I also spin HHC music. When I saw this at Best Buy for 7.99 I had to buy it. Then I got it home and was extremely disappointed. I love the old school hard and fast happy hardcore. This stuff seemed like the new trancey hardcore. Only about one song with female vocals which was a decent track but most of the rest just sucked. Scott Brown is one of my favorite Dj's besides Hixxy but he should have never put his name on this one. Throw a lil breakbeat or drum n bass into it. Something to break up the trance. The sad thing is that it's cheap and people that don't know the music will pick it up and believe that this is truly Happy Hardcore. That's why they should pay the extra and get Happy 2 B Hardcore or just invest in a turntable and grab some tracks that really represent the scene.dj a.m.e"
1,"""Xperience""?","I must say that this is not 'happy hardcore'. I was seduced by the low price and title and went ""okay, this will be cool'. It's really not. It's more techno then anything else, and not even good techno at that. If you want happy hardore, I suggest anything in the 'Happy 2b Hardcore' realm, especialy chapters 1,2,and 4, Happy Hardcore Hysteria; Happy Hardcore Foundation,Vol 1 and Vol. 2. Anything can be better then this."
2,I didn't really get the Xperience....,"I'm going to have to agree with Daniel from Georgia on his review. I got suckered in to buying this CD (expecting happy hardcore music) due to the low price and some of the artists on this comp are actual HH composers. However, this CD could barely even be considered Nu-Nrg...it's just hard electronica music. If you are looking for some happy hardcore music then search elsewhere, but not this comp."
1,Annoying Waste of Time Killer,"George Kiseleff stars as Gary Ridgway or The Greeennnn Rivverrrr Killeerrrr. Anyways he is married and has a son and goes out to bars, picks up some prostitutes and either brings them back to his place when his wife is gone and makes his son hide in the bathroom when he kills them or somewhere else. Then after he kills his victims he brings the bodies of the women and stashes them alongside the Green River...um, yeah. They also have actually footage of the real Ridgway sprinkled in. Also during this boring piece of crud he narrates the women's names. Gloria, Pamela, Betty, Veronica, Dolly, Molly...whatever. The acting is beyond awful and it's direction is sloppy. The writing is idiotic as well as the dialouge. It seemed like it would never end when I was watching it. I wasnt actually screaming for it to end, I was just annoyed. BLAH!!"
1,A Disgusting Film!,This movie absolutely disgusted me! It's a hideous thinly disguised sado/masochist film. Whoever produced the movie needs to get some help. Way too much time was spent showing us the sexual details involved in these horrible murders as if the film maker savored the acts. It almost seemed like a porn film.
1,Not even close,"We rented this last night and didn't make it halfway through. Terrible, absolutely terrible. The worst of it has already been mentioned in prior comments. I'll add that they were not even close on any facts. I understand the restraints of a limited budget. But please do some research and get an actor who, at least, has a slight resemblance to Ridgeway. If you're interested in this case, please do not rent this crap. Go to the library and do the research the old fashioned way."
2,green river killer,"come on people !!! why so negative is only a movie just have fun whith it ; ok it was base on a real life event but what the heg just grab a beer and have fun . we horror fans watch this kind of movies just to have fun , we are not looking for holywood oscar winners. did i spell holywood right?"
1,STUPID,"Honestly, should I ever again see a movie with Ulli Lommel's name attached to it I'll pass. I purchased this movie and two other films from this person and have never seen movies this bad. Amature filming, amature acting, retarded plodding plots. Nonsensical direction. A&E did a movie titled ""The Riverman"" which was way better than this schlock. Don't waste your money on Lommel's films. Of the three I purchased I watched 3/4 of The Green River Killer, maybe 1/4 of Black Dahlia, and I'm not even going to bother with The Zodiac Killer. Lion's Gate should be ashamed, they've produced way better than this."
1,Among The Worst Movies of All Time...Avoid It Like the Plague !!!,"I knew going in that this would not be a masterpiece of filmmaking, but always the optimist, I naively assumed that it may have some redeeming virtues. I was wrong. Every second watching this abomination is a second wasted. The script, acting, direction, sound, cinematography, plot, etc. are just plain awful. Indeed, the overall quality is so low that it cannot be explained simply by a lack of money or talent....it is like some awful inside joke played upon the audience. Don't fall for it."
1,Don't Waste Your Money....,"I rented this movie expecting more than this movie delivers. This is a bad, cheap and boring movie. Don't be fooled by the box. It is deceiving because it leads you to believe that a good horror movie awaits you but not the case. I wanted to cut the movie off by the halfway point! I wouldn't recommend even renting this movie for it would be a waste of money!"
1,*Not recommended*,"I agree, an aweful film. There was almost no talking, instead seemed more like a porno-flick...Also inacurate as he did not work in a warehouse, instead painted semis at Kenworth. I real joke if you want to learn about the ""Green River Killer"""
1,Very disappointed,The actors were very bad and it was a boring movie and I won't be purchasing any more of these movies as they are too expensive for what they are
3,Disappointed,This movie was not what I thought I ordered! I thought of sending it back but I had already opened it and it would cost me almost as much to send it back rather than keeping it. I wanted the made for TV Lifetime movie.
1,A mess,"This is one the most ""nothing of a movie"" that I have seen. It was awful....nothing but porn to me. I have seen other movies on serial killers that had ""substance"". I gave it a ""1"" rating because there was no ZERO."
3,Ulli Lommel's Green River Killer,"The Green River Killer is another in a series of films either based upon or loosely based upon famous serial killers. Ulli Lommel's take upon The Green River Killer is interesting. He uses the digital camera quite well and it reminds me of a documentary in spots as well go for ride arounds with the killer and a personal view of his home and work life. The murders are sick and they're supposed to be. Whoever said murder wasn't? We also have to keep in mind how this man was a twisted and cruel individual. The commentary is quite interesting I recommend listening to Ulli Lommel talk about his experiences with cinema and a few helpful tips about filmmaking.For those who critic his work, that's fine. We all have an opinion, but to say ""I can do better with a couple of bucks and camera"" is nonsense."
1,If only they had a NO star rating.,"Gouge your eyes out before you watch this pitiful movie. I wish I'd read the reviews *before* we wasted the [...] on it. All it seems to be is an excuse to see [...].There are some flaws in this movie: for example, he hands the prostitute a $10 bill and it's the ""new"" money that we got last year or something...but it's supposed to be 1981.At one point we saw him driving past a palm tree; it's supposed to be upstate Washington.Smack the person who tries to make you watch this movie."
1,I wish i could give this a zero,If i could I would not even bother to give this movie a star my goodness this movie is a disgrace I mean even though the victims did what they did they deserved more then this movie at least get in depth with the victims stories or something. How this movie was ever produced and released is beyond me avoid it or you'll pay.
4,Good read,Item arrived in good condition and packaged well. Upon my brief examination thusfar I have found the book to be enlightining and informative. It really give insight into Stieglitz personality especially as it pertains to his relationship with women. I would recommend this to anyone that wanted to know how in my opinion an artistic genious clicked.
5,Sounds of the Season: The Country Collection,"I brought this CD for one song, GARY ALLAN's ""O' Holy Night"". I was very pleased with the whole CD. Would recommand this dealer."

4,Pictures don't lie,"I got 3 of these shirts, I thought the red wouldn't be shiney like in the picture but it really is, lesson learned I guess. Other shirts are great, feels pretty nice great for price."
4,"Unexpected story, interesting language","The way the story unfolded was definitely not how I expected it, but I enjoyed it. It's not your typical ""chik-lit"" book, all smiles, roses, and happy endings for your favorite characters. The language aspect of it was interesting. I don't want to say vulgar per-se, but the wording is strong and for a reader like me, I was a bit shocked with what came out of Zadie's mouth at times. My only other criticism is there seemed to be a number of typos, and with it being a digital version, I have to question how that happened. Maybe 5-8 occasions, two words would be joined together and lacking the space. It didn't disturb the reading, but typos in a book is a huge pet peeve of mine, especially with it being digital. Overall, I enjoyed it and think I'll probably read it again."
3,Amusing but Trite,"It's odd how many twenty/thirty-something women in this novel lose all self-control after one shot of tequila--they can't keep their (...) brains on.This novel has moments of hilarity but none of wit--a breezy read, with some refreshingly mean moments, but no originality or intelligence.Read Darcy Cosper instead."
5,witty and laugh-out-loud hilarious!,"While probably considered 'raunchy' in some circles, I think this book was refreshingly real. I found myself literally laughing out loud at Zadie's wit, sarcasm & cynicism. The characters in the book are diverse and equally entertaining. Read it!"
5,Hilarious,"This book is so fun and entertaining. I can't count how many times I laughed out loud. I read the second part of the book on the plane and the people around me must have thought I was on something when I would burst out in laughter randomly. I love the character Zadie. She's spunky, smart, painfully honest and has a mean girl attitude that would be a hoot to be friends with."
3,Just OK...,"As other readers have mentioned, this book is very raunchy and will definitely offend some. I found the first half to drag on... kept feeling like I'd rather get to the point. Once the middle took over, it was more fun and entertaining. Still not the type of book I just couldn't put down though. If you're in the mood for ""chick lit"" you don't want to put down, check out Whitney Gaskell, Janet Evanovich or Beth Kendrick..."
2,Predictable plot and vulgar language,"Like most of these books, the plot is completely predictable. But I even guessed the little plot twists and turns, let alone the major ones. I was really not sympathetic to the character at all. She's just too wittily cynical, and sooo vulgar. Cursing and graphic sexual language, which doesn't offend me at all, but in this book it's just annoying and out of place. I think the author just uses this type of language to be sensational and ""cutting edge."" It serves no purpose and is not necessary. A continuous tangent about masturbating is not important to the plot at all. After the ""shocking"" and ""out-of-nowhere"" major plot twist, I just stopped reading and don't plan on picking it up again. Oh, and the excessive name-dropping of celebrities and trendy LA nightspots, just becomes too much."
3,"Good tasting, good-for-you food.","My mother used this book and two others by Harriet Roth to help my father lower his cholesterol four years ago. My son was three then, and he loved the food, too. Lots of tasty recipes in Roth's books, along with some interesting commentary and common sense about eating and preparing food. Some of the recipes can be pretty labor intensive, especially for the two week diet that helps dramatically lower your cholesterol, but it does work - my father's level dropped significantly in that two weeks, and he lost 10 pounds, too."
5,Good recipes,Ahh. All my diet requirements in each recipe! Makes it easy to decide on what to cook -- and how to prepare it.
1,Waste of time and money,"If you want to learn German vocabulary for business, vocabulary beyond tourist basics, this is NOT the book. A waste of time and money."
3,The Absolute Discography for the Beatles!,"With Pictures of every English and US Album Released...and info on every single, who could ask for more in a Discography? All the ""bitties"" you could shake your stick at, rumors, band info, and more. Follow the orgins of the ""Paul is Dead Story"" Unforunatly this book is only good to learn facts about the Beatles Music no one really needs to know...unless you are an ultimate fan...then go for it!"
3,Inspirational!,"I will read this book again for inspiration. Regardless of your religion this books speaks of true ""Spirituality and peace"". If that's what you're searching for, then reading this book is a grand step towards accomplishing it."
3,A Christian perspective,"I know what you're thinking, ""What in the world is this Christian reading now?"" Well to be honest, I've always and continue to believe if we expect people to sit down and listen to us preach about our religion, we had better understand where they are coming from. We often get into the ""I don't care what you have to say, just listen to me, my religion is the right one."" mode and forget that we should ""first seek to understand then to be understood."" (Steven Covey) This book does a good job in relating Buddhism's basic teachings to those who want to understand what Buddhism is all about. Of course, I have some major differences of opinion on certain things, but there is also a lot of common ground between Buddhism and Christianity. Fundamentally, Buddhist's have a whole lot more faith in mankind than the Prophet Jerimiah (33:9)."
5,a true synopsis of Buddhism,"This book reflects the particular views that T.N.H. teaches Westerners about Buddhism. It is a synergistic product of all his previous books. I keep it beside my bed to read periodically in spurts. Each reading sheds new or brighter light on T.N.H.'s Mindfullness Training, the 5 Precepts, the 3 Jewels, the 4 Nobel Truths, the Eightfold Path, etc.I highly recomment it to anyone who is at least slightly familiar with T.N.H. and his view of Mahayana Buddhism."
4,Read With Caution,"THBT is divided into four parts: the first, an introduction to the 4Noble Truths; the second, the Eightfold Path; the third, to some of the major Buddhist and Mahayana-Buddhist concepts such as, the Three Dharma Seals, The Twelve Links of Dependent Co-Arising, and the Three Bodies of the Buddha, etc; the fourth part, includes some discourses such as the ""Turning of the Wheel"" and ""Right View."" As is usual with TNH the writing is clear, and very accessible, but without outside information it is hard for a beginner to know that the views expressed are not of a ""generic"" Buddhism but of a particular sub-group of Mahayanist teaching. The book can, however provide a solid basis for understanding Buddhism, Buddhist philosophy and most importantly a particular expression of the gentle and non-coercive nature of the Buddha's message."
5,Interconnected!,This book requires the reader to explore the interelatedness of all the Buddhist doctrines. I read this at the same time as Bhante Gunaratana's *Eight Mindful Steps to Happiness* and found that it provided a depth and meaning that Gunaratana's simpler exposition did not. That's not to say that I was not confused at various points! But Thich Nhat Hanh's warmth and loving-kindness reaches right off the page to express the inner meaning of the Buddha's teaching in daily life. Well worth digging into.
4,A Great Introduction,"This book is great for people who are just beginning to study Buddhism, like myself. This book discusses the basic principles of Buddhisms, and although it does get a little confusing what with all the teachings (i.e. the Four Noble Truths, the Noble Eightfold Path, the Three Doors of Liberation, the Three Dharma Seals ect.) it is very informative, and makes me very excited to continue to learn more about this religion/type of living!"
4,Easy to understand & valuable to daily life quickly,The author is easy to read and follow as well as interesting and compelling. The processes are quickly applied to daily life and bring the spiritual world to bear on daily life and struggles.
5,Thich Nhat Hanh simplifies the Buddha's teachings,"Wonderfully clear explanation of many of Buddha's teachings. I find the ancient Pali translations difficult, while Thich Nhat Hanh explains the practices in a modern, relevant, way. There is an intellectual honesty in TNH's writing, because it is evident he has personally experienced whatever he ""preaches"".The Buddha was an eternal optimist, as is Thich Nhat Hanh. Of course, it depends upon concentrated practice to get the benefits of clear thinking and peace within.Sincerely,Steve SimonPalisades Park, NJ USA"
5,Review of Thich Nhat Hanh's book on Buddha's Teaching,"I was looking for an overall review of the teaching of the Buddha. I have been practicing these teachings for 10 years and have been teaching for 8 years, and I found the book easy to comprehend and a very good review at an intermediate level. I use the book as a text for my current series of talks on the Noble Eightfold Path. I highly recommend this book.Art HansenAnnapolis, MD"
5,OMG Guatama Sakyumuni,If this book can't guide you towards enlightment than you are destined to return to this wheel of samsara. Better luck next time around. An excellent introduction to Buddhism.
5,Practical help for a mindful life,"Buddhist philosophy is interesting and appealing but practicing Buddhism, even in the most basic way, is liberating. Thich Nhat Hanh transforms philosophy into accessible tools to live a more mindful life beginning right now. His explanation of the Buddha's teaching is charming and encouraging. Just reading this book makes one feel peaceful. I will read it again and again."
5,The Heart of the Buddha's teaching,"Great book, fully detailed, very informative for those who like to learn about this great religion and its principals. It is kind of like a text book and covers many areas and beliefs in Buddha's teaching. Overal, it is highly recommended"
5,Great book,A very important book about Buddhism. All people who are interested in this religion should read this book. Totally recommended.
4,Lets Change our mindset.,"When I hear teachings, statements, quotes, what have you from Buddhist writing I have always liked them. I have been going to many changes over the last two years and my best friend (who happens to be Buddhist) recommended this to me."
5,Wonderfully enlightening!,My husband and I have been reading this aloud together. The information has been so healing and empowering. Mindfulness techniques to last a lifetime! We both wish we had found this information many years ago! The book is very well written and current.
5,The book for all people,"This is truly a beautiful offering to the mind and the soul. I lend this book to others only to have then weep with joy upon returning it. Many have remarked that ""this is the book that should be in all hotel rooms!"""
1,Incomplete and Unhelpful,"This book is an adaptation of a book that was originally published in the UK. It's full of Britishisms, most of which the reader can probably figure out. But some are confusing.The instructions are incomplete; some steps are glossed over. Recommended sources for unusual materials are vague.I am an experienced papermaker and paper artist. I would not recommend this book for any level of user. You can get more/better elsewhere."
3,Just ok.,"Pretty expensive for just 3 games. My 3 year old loves Dora, but just doesn't seem to like this software. I recommend saving your money- this game is a dud."
3,Not as good as Nickjr.com,I got this game plus the Click Start computer because my 2 year old loves playing games on nickjr.com. I was hoping to lure her away from the computer with this game. But it really does not compare to the games on nickjr.com. The graphics are like Atari-days - giant pixels. And the games just aren't as engaging. She'll play with it for a couple of minutes and then asks to go use the real computer.
3,"Comfortable, but very utilitarian looking","Clark's usually fit me well, and this one was no exception. They should last forever.But:-- they are hard to shine, not like the photo.-- soles look like stiff foam from the side.This sole makes them comfortable, but you'll not win the ""business dresser of the year"" award with these."
2,Definate Second Quality Item,"First, the shoes are comfortable and stylish. In brown I received an excellent pair of shoes. In black (the left shoe only) had inferior quality of leather thus not properly matching the right shoe, and makes squeeky noises when walking. Definately will be calling Amazon to return for another pair. This should never have made it to market."
2,Squeaky,"These shoes feel great, fit great too. The worst part about them is they squeak, and squeak loud. I cannot sneak out of the office or around employees because they are so loud and everyone knows I am coming."
5,Great,I have had these shoes for 4 years have walked many many miles with them. I frequently take a 3-4 mile walk. Still going strong. The soles are worn but no holes. Very very comfortable. They are a bit big around the ball of the foot but that is great for me for my feet like breathing room.
2,Too big to use.,My husband does not use these because they are too big to use. The handles are hard to hold together.
4,Eh,"I bought these becuase they looked sweet. They are, but THEY ARE HUGE! takes me two hands to close these things!"
3,It requires AC Power to work.,"One of the claims is it frees all the cables. It doesn't. IT REQUIRES AC POWER TO WORK. Normally all the portable devices that I have seen come with a battery. But this device doesn't and you need to connect the adapter or tweak the hardware to supply power from your board. So, basically you are eliminating RS232 cable and replacing it with a power cable.I tried this with Windows 7 and it showing up as two com ports. I can send data but cannot receive data from device. I tried to contact customer support and they charge 100 dollars to debug my problem.Update:Thanks to the forums, it looks like the device is doing hardware handshake and there is no way to disable it :(.If you want to connect to a system with no RTS and CTS pins, then just connect another serial cable (this will make this null cable) and short RTS and CTS lines."
2,Doesn't Support Baud Rates below 9600 bps,"This is a convenient and easy to use device. However, I needed to configure the Baud rate to 4800 bps for the device I'm using it for. The documentation in the user's manual indicates that you can override the DIP switch lowest setting of 9600 bps by connecting it to a computer via a serial interface and using HyperTerminal. When I configure the device to 4800 bps via HyperTerminal, it remembers the setting, but via testing I discovered that it is in 9600 bps mode still. I need 4800, so it's going back."
2,"Communicates, does not clear up cable clutter","I work in a computer lab with over 100 yards of floor space filled with servers and switches, and we use serial connections constantly to configure and troubleshoot. Having serial cables snaked around racks is annoying and leaves the user chained down.Like others trying to use this to replace serial cables, I see this was not thought out very well. If they had a model that used the female serial connection, and either got its power from the serial connection or used a USB cable for power, it'd be dead-on perfect.As it is, we did test this with a blade chassis at 115200 and Putty, and it worked fine. Pairing the two adapters was dead simple. The problem is the amount of mucking around with the serial converter and A/C power doesn't deliver on the promise to clear up the cable clutter. It makes more."
3,It could be refined a little more but works,"This device works as expected. The claimed distance might be a little oversold though. I too assumed this was completely wireless, without the need for a power adapter - so was a little disappointed.This device does work as advertised, I have used it to connect to various pieces of network Hardware."
4,Very good direct damage dealing deck.,solar flare dragon + level limit area B + dark room of nightmare + backfire = direct damage every turnlevel limit area B + ultimate baseball kid + raging flame sprite = dangerous combo
1,What the Package?,"This package contains the wrong structure deck. I don't know what kind of people sell these things, but I wish they didn't exist. What I got was a Fury of the Deep Structure Deck, but on the description, it was a Blaze of Destruction 1st edition structure deck and the picture, as well. I returned it and if you already bought it, you should do the same and if haven't, don't."
4,Serious scholarship here.,"Well-rounded and thorough, with a very readable background as well, it lacks serious photographs to complement the text."
5,THE ONLY COFFEE FILTER I WILL BUY,"I have looked and looked for these coffee filters and found them at Amazon. They are natural and not bleached (using bleach, of course.) I will always order them, as long as they are available."
1,Toilevator is a piece of Junk,"This product is cheaply made and is plastic, not porcelain as you would expect. They will not allow a return because they know you will want to return it. The price should be about 25.00 because that's all it's worth. It is greatly overpriced for the quality. Do not buy this product."
3,Prog Saga goes pop,"When I bought this way back when it came out ,I did not like this one bit ,with the exception of the song 'Take a chance',which is amazing.They had now gone further 'astray' from the magical first 3 albums,and it disappointed me big time.Found it on cd about a month ago and thought what the heck,since I was on another Saga appreciation period.Now it was just a very tasteful pop cd with great prog moments to make this a fantastic addition to the Saga collection.What I am saying,this should not be bought as a classic Saga cd,cause then you will be dissapointed .Buy it for what Saga was about in 85."
1,To be perfectly honest...,"This release is a waste of time and money. There is nothing about this recording that hints of the breath-taking work performed with Worlds Apart, Heads or Tales, or Security of Illusion. The best adjectives I can attach to Behaviour are dull, boring, bland. In fact, I was even somewhat angry when I first listened to it, because my expectations had been raised by Worlds Apart. Saga is a great band, but their greatness doesn't show on Behaviour."
5,very satisfied,"Quick shipment, item as described. WONDERFUL recipe book!!! Must have when you make your own baby food!"
3,wait until babies eat what you eat,"why the rush toward preparing baby food? Breastfeed as =much as your child wishes for *at least* the first year, and then introduce your regular table food. If you have to mush it up and prepare it specially, it generally isnt' worth bothering with"
2,too slow,"I have gotten to page 74 and decided that I will not read any further. The author begins well enough to create a general feeling and mood about the neighborhood that she has moved into, but as she progresses into describing the neighbors in more detail, she seems to continually focus on what makes them different in a negative way. She constantly reminds the reader that she is not condenscending but she is! She is ""embarrassed"" to have dinner with her neighbors in the chapter ""The Mayor""- why - because they are poor! She describes another neighbor as a ""simpleton"" in ""Ahmed's Garden"" - why - because he does not have a good use of the Hebrew language! She never seems to be able to get into the neighbors' heads and view their lives through their eyes. The sentence structure throughout is tedious and by the time I get to the end of the sentence, I have lost the train of thought if there was one! Sorry, I pass on this one."
3,"Wonderful writing, although.....","It's great writing, it uses many wonderful words and sentences. Although after about the 13th (to be exact) page, it seems to become unimportant. She is talking about how her purse got stolen, and then she recieved it back, with everything but the money. Not only this so early in the book, but she tells who she thought did it, and who she thought returned it, and how she still isn't sure to this day...blah blah blahI just found this really annoying. Sorry Adina.."
4,A Softer Jerusalem,"I read this book while visiting Israel last summer. It is gentle. The writer has a poetic soul and now, reading it from USA, it gives us a vision of Jerusalem that isn't at war, a nice image if unfortunately not a true one-- not now. But there is a lyrical rhythm to this book that I recommend. 4 Stars."
5,Window into a fascinating world,"I could not disagree more with ""readernyc""! I hope that the reader is aware that this book is a work of non-fiction, where plot, per se, is not the purpose. The book is full of stories and characters -- real live characters vividly and sympathetically portrayed. I found Hoffman's descriptions evocative and powerful. This book provides a far more realistic portrait of life in Israel than does the evening news. But it is more than a story about a Jerusalem neighborhood and the people living side by side there. It is about simultaneously being an insider and an outsider, it is about challenging one's initial judgments of others and of the unfamiliar, and it is about understandings one's context. I highly recommend this book!"
4,Too Bad she didn't have a Larger Publisher,"Unlike her fellow Jerusalemite, David Horovitz, Hoffman knows how to poetically render the city of lights. She is a fine craftswoman, might well have been or become a fine poet."
3,A little Boring but good,"I lived in Jerusalem and what I liked most there was how lively and friendly everyone was. That aliveness is not inside this book. You don't get the flavor of how exciting Jerusalem is. But then everyone has their own Jerusalem.I guess this just isn't mine. I would like to meet the author though, since she sounds very smart and understanding."
3,Well.....okay,"It delivered what it said it would - 1,440 reasons to quit. Not all of them inspired though ... It's a small book too - the type is also small. I didn't think it was worth the money spent. You could find more inspiration online or from sections of more meaty books like Complete Idiots Guide to Quitting. After getting through the first few pages I was like ""Dang! - I could do a more imaginative job myself"" (and I'm a crummy writer) :-) But hey, if you want to send a message to a smoking friend .... this is a positive and non-confrontational way to do it....would make a good stocking stuffer too (it's that small...)"
1,If you're desperate to spend your cig money on something...,"Ok, so you're going to quit smoking.... CONGRATS!!!! WOOHOO!!! GOOD FOR YOU!!!!!So you can't think of a reason to quit? What are ya deaf, blind, dumb, and living on a deserted island?Search the Internet, learn about tobacco related illness and ask any ex-smoker what's wrong with smoking...voila...you now have a TON MORE than this book is going to offer you.However, if you need a small paperback pocketbook that simply lists items such as ""Your mama is going to be so pleased with you"" and ""Less risk of illness"" then go ahead and spend your money on this book.The book is worth FAR MORE than a pack of cigarettes so if it comes down to smokes or this book..then buy the book."
1,"Well-constructed, but...","Heavy-weight fabric & well constructed, but oddly proportioned; very tight a waist and seriously long length, compared to any other brand of sweats that I've purchased. I suspect that Amazon's marketing strategy for clearing out quirky products is to lower the price, rather than improve the description... Still, if you're a very skinny basketball player, you're gonna love 'em. For average builds, order at least one-size larger than usual, & plan on cutting or rolling-up the legs!"
4,"Works well, but one annoying flaw","I've had this fan for awhile now and it works well. However, I moved and went to use it on a carpeted floor and found out that the little plastic 'legs' on the front are longer than the back so it won't stand up straight on my carpet without putting something behind it."
1,Smells of burning wires,I haven't used my 3720 that much. Last night I woke to the smell of burning wires coming from the fan.Very disappointed in quality.I've had a Holmes fan that runs every night all night long for 4 years and not problems ever.
1,Over rated even at one star,Allow me to second the first review's rating . First of all the picture is not what the fan actually looks like . I would say it was a standard 12$ box fan and that someone had shipped the wrong fan if it it did not have the model number/decal on it. Think this fan retail price is 19$ @ Home Depot. Second and fatal problem if you move the fan away from it standard position (as if you lean it back a bit to angle airflow upward (even just a little )) the Fan starts making a noise as if the fan blades are hitting something. The fan wasn't 10 days old when the problem showed up. I would return it but it would be more trouble than what it is worth.
2,It makes noise right after I purchased it from Wal-Mart today.,"LASKO model 3720, I just got it from Wal mart today 07/03/2006 around 9:00 PM for $15.99 plus tax. I opened the box and start to use it but there is a noise. The fan works but the noise... (it seems some plastic inside or a loosed screw???) I have to return it. This product shows slightly different from the photo, but, my box shows LASKO Model 3720."
1,DOA,"DOA - fan didn't work out of the box, though there wasn't apparent shipping damage. Doesn't anyone check these things off the line?"
2,"It blows, which is all that one expects from a fan","The Lasko 3720* is a run-of-the-mill box fan, except for the ""Weather Shield"" motor. This allows the user to leave the fan in a window during all but heavier storms, without fear of damage. Construction is adequate, about what I would expect from a fan in this price range. Not sure how long the fan will last, but with the current heat wave, mine is getting a workout. Note that the 3720 is no longer shown on Lasko's website, and they don't appear to offer an equivalent model.* The 3720 is NOT the model pictured in this listing. The model shown is actually aLasko 3900 Performance Air Cleaner, which has a pleated paper filter on the intake side."
1,Not worth the price..,"This is a $20 fan, tops, at WALMART. It is not as pictured in the product description. Nothing more than a cheap box fan with some stickers on it. Don't be fooled."
1,terrible fan!,had 2--first one quit after 3 months--second one turned off and on at will--bought the model 3723(3733 is same) and its motor is more powerful and amazing! get this model--best of the breed and sells for 20 bucks shipping included--shop around
4,Okay,"Could be quieter as older models used to be. But again, nothing's getting better only worse. It's okay tho, it blows air. The thing i like the best is that when used on hard floor surface you don't have to put those feet on it to have it stand without tipping and falling; meaning you can go from a narrow window sill to floor without taking feet on/off. The regular Lasko box-fan can't do that."
1,terrible terrible terrible,"I have two of these from other companies. This is a piece of crap.The construction is chinzy, THe hardware does not go with the base and they did n't send enough screws. There were only tabs for 10 pages not 20.The little gray rubber things prevented the files from sitting properly.what a piece of crap. oh and the instructions were outdated and for a different style.almost 100 dollars for this - it's a throw away."
3,Not as effective as I had hoped,I'm not sure if it's just taking longer for me to feel pain relief than the typical person or if this product just doesn't work with my problems. It does help a little but not as much as I had hoped.
2,Seems a good product but doesn't work well on my condition,I had heard from several people that this product gave some relief from severe arthritic and rhuematism conditions. Unfortunately in my case the relief was very minimal but that may not be true in less severe cases of my conditions
2,Did not work.,"The gel is not very strong, It did not work for me. The ointment is suppose to be better give it a try."
3,"works , expensive.","the gel works to relieve pain. It does not have the heat or smell of some of the others. The relief good , but not as long lasting as others in this price range. Expensive for the quantity"
3,Gel O.K.... Cream better!,Used Traumeel for many years. Tried the Gel this time instead of the cream.Gel seemed messier and I don't feel it was as effective.I'll try the cream again next time.
5,Heel homeopathics are wonderful,"As a Naturopathic Doctor, I have been using Heel products for over 10 years. I swear by the quality and effectiveness and know that I'm always getting a good product that works. Homeopathy is the greatest alternative to western medicine."
3,Traumeel Gel for Muscle Aches,Seems to work as well as any other product of this kind. I am always leery of organic products. but this was okay. I don't think I would buy it again only because I don't think any product of this type does what it claims. I take Aleve and that seems to work best.
2,Didn't work for me,"Maybe I'm using this to fix something it can't, but this did nothing for my problem. Nothing good, nothing bad. Just nothing. It's colorless, reasonably odorless, and completely useless (for me)."
1,Not worth the Mercury!,"This is a potentially dangerous product. One of the major ingredients, MERCURIUS SOLUBILIS, is linked to the following problems: Cancer, Developmental/reproductive toxicity, Violations, restrictions & warnings, Neurotoxicity, Endocrine disruption, Allergies/immunotoxicity, Persistence and bioaccumulation, Organ system toxicity (non-reproductive), Occupational hazards, Biochemical or cellular level changes.For more, visit www.cosmeticsdatabase.com. It's worth bookmarking."
4,Wonderful Product,"I was introduced to traumeel by my accupuncturist. Its an absolutely wonderful product. I can now receive relief from pain within 10-15 minutes. Please note, you must first use the product consistently for 2-3 weeks first. AS with any anti-inflammatories it takes time to reduce the swelling.I believe it workds better than most oral arthritis medications. Even one of the doctors at my local Kaiser Pain clinic uses Traumeel.I would suggest looking for cheaper prices. At one point the Vitamin store had sold this product for $39.90. This is no longer the case. I suggest looking to other sellers with reduced prices.The product itself is a must try for anyone with arthritic related pain. For me, its my secret weapon for dealing with my degenerative arthritis. I happen to have both osteo and rhuemetoid arthritis. It makes a significant difference for both disorders."
3,HOTTEST THING IN EUROPE,The brand name product can be used in a Medical Environment for pain. Like most Over the Counter it is watered down but it should not be written off.
5,Wonderful product for immediate Relief,"My chiropractor recommended this to me. I've recommended to others. And it's just wonderful. I haven't had to take any pain meds since I started using this.It's homeopathic and works instantly. Much, much better than any over the counter items you find at a drug store, such as the patches or bengay-like creams.I found the Traumeel gel to work better than the Traumeel cream, so be careful when ordering make sure which is the one you want. I didn't know it comes in a cream as well and accidentally ordered it on Amazon, but didn't find it as helpful or as quick in providing relief.Traumeel gel been helpful for me and family members with chronic inflammation, muscle pain, and even nerve-related pain.There are times that I wish I could fill up a tub with Traumeel and just soak in it! If you suffer from chronic pain, you can relate."
5,Really good stuff....,"As recommended by a friend after a painful knee injury, I began regular use both gel and pills. Two months of use have made the situation much more manageable. Found 250g. gel best buy after cost comparisons online. Recommending to friends with arthritis aches. Pricey, but good stuff."
5,An accurate view of The World's Most Unusual University!,"This book is an answer to the questions and rumors that circulate in today's world! It is an accurate history of Bob Jones University founded by Dr. Bob Jones in 1927. It explains its beginnings, struggles and unwavering Biblical stands that has made it what it is today."
1,Too late...,"Trying to capitalize on the street racing scene and the success of the Fast and the furious franchise and need for speed series. This film is too little too late. I'll give it up to decent camera work but bad acting, bad line delivery, and the same ole' romeo juliet story ruined it. It felt like a self important student film trying to be edgy. Save yourself the cash folks."
2,What was this?,"I read about this movie in Super Street magazine years ago. I bought it based on the premise it was Romeo & Juilet meets The Fast and the Furious. But the movie had little racing scenes and a crappy story line. Don't even buy it previously viewed, wait till its on tv or a dumb friend bought it. SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!"
5,Can't meditate well? Learn with this!,"This book, most particularly the introduction, has such a clear description of how to begin meditations that I have finally begun to have effective and meaningful time with our Lord.Full of mediations on dozens of topics, there is enough source material for a decade of daily meditation.This book is not meant to read straight through. You can, but you will not get what the book is really aiming at. It does present orthodox Catholic teachings so modernists will probably not enjoy this very much.While written in an easy and relaxed style, each sentence and paragraph is full deeper meaning and material to fuel your mediation.This is a very good and effective guide for those who seek to improve their spirituality through meditation.This book carries both an imprimatur and a nihil obstat."
5,All you need and exactly that,"This book has exactly what you need to know to understand tools in signal processing and data analysis based on matrix computation. There is nothing frivolous, which is something I really appreciate."
4,Quick delivery,I received the book within a week of my order.Book was new and in good condition.Only packing was not that great causing the back cover to be slightly damaged.
2,Mastermind Board Game,"I thought I was getting a wooden Mastermind game, so this impacted my overall evaluation."
5,Rescue Heroes,"I purchased this a gift for a friend's child. She continuously raves about how much her son loves this toy and has had it for a few years now, still in good condition."
4,Adventures of Swiss Family Robinson,"Good serialized storyline. Excellent footage combining studio and locations. Good cast.The only thing they could have improved was condensing the packaging. Six large DVD cases takes up too much shelf space for bulk collectors like myself. Other serieses have been released single cases with folding DVD holders a fraction of the size.But buy it anyway. The later episodes will keep you glued to the TV, and the earlier ones will set the mood for that.Peter"
3,$549.00 R U KIDDING ME!,I purchased these for my mom for mothers days two years ago ($49.99 then $549.00 now LOL) We used velcro to attached them to her kayak. she loved it! Now after two years the rubber around the speakers has dry rotted and the company is out of business. It was a good product for a couple years but Never in a million years worth $549.00
3,IPOD Waterproof Docking Case,"I ordered this to use with my aquatic classes. The product works, the controls are easy to manipulate, but the sound is not loud enough for a pool environment. If you are using this docking station at home, it will perform to your satisfaction. But in a public pool, it just didn't produce the sound we needed."
5,Just what I was looking for.,I love this. The sound is good but could be louder. I am very happy with this purchase.
4,"Great for the price, but could be louder!","This item is a very good, water tight sealed ipod speaker. It is one of the only ones that actually fully protects your ipod. It could be a little louder but all in all this is a great product."
2,"shower radio maybe, but floating not so much","I bought this case to take with me floating down the river. It came with an enclosed strap which i used to hang it from my neck while i floated.long story short, water got in the case which caused the music to cut in and out. It didnt mess up my ipod and most of the water was kept from the ipod compartment, but the water got in the other two compartments that surrounded the speakers.Sound wasnt real loud, if you turned the volume up, at a certain level, the speakers would cut out from too much power trying to be pushed out of the speakers.If you just want to hang it below your shower or next to your pool, and you plan on being right next to it, it should work just fine and be loud enough. if you're wanting to listen to it from 5ft+ or if you think you might accidentally drop it on the water (it will float) then it might not be the best option."
3,"Nice workmanship, but small sound","Unfortunately, the sound matches its size. It's clear sound, but the deck-of-card-sized speakers don't perform sonic miracles.On the plus side, it's easy to get your ipod in and out of the case, and the case really is water proof. Seems that if you're in an environment where the ipod will get soaked - like a pool or in the shower - you'd need the volume cranked up louder than the eGo will go. When I used it in the shower, the water drowned out the music - I don't think that makes sense.It's great if you want portability and will play music at low volumes. I personally would have lugged around something twice as big in exchange for twice as big sound."
5,Perfect for the beach,"We love the beach and we are usually each sitting plugged into our individual ipods.....this was the perfect solution. The sound quality is remarkable,considering its such a small piece of equipment. It also comes with a drawstring case which makes it handy for taking along. Love this product."
4,GIFT WAS A SUCCESS!,I GAVE THIS AS A CMAS GIFT & IT WAS VERY WELL RECEIVED-SHE GAVE IT VERY HIGH MARKS!
2,"It is waterproof, though",thats about all i can say about this product thats positive. its very hard to change the songs inside the box. sound sucks too. all in all its ok if you have nothing else.
2,Neat concept but doesn't quite fit the bill,"Yes, it is water proof, but that's the only way in which it met my expectations. The sound quality was poor and the volume level was laughable. Not at all what I was expecting. I returned it."
3,Good for personal use,"This product really is waterproof, no problem there at all. It comes with inserts to accomodate different size ipods or mp3 players. One down fall is that it doesn't play the music very loud. It is good if you are in your pool by yourself or with a friend and want to have the ipod player near you in the pool. It is not ideal for a party, it is not loud enough. Unique toy though!"
3,Pool Ipod,"It's pretty neat out of the pool, but in th pool it tends to sink a little too much cusing the speakers to fill up with water and making it hard to hear as clearly as when it is out of the pool. Still a cool product...just needs some improvements."
2,Volume is Horrible!,The volume on this is so low you can barely hear it. I don't recommend use for anything outdoors. Maybe for in the shower or something and that's about it. The construction seems sturdy and it's pretty easy to use. Just couldn't hear the darn thing!
5,Wet Music,This unit really surprised me. It sounds good (even at high volumes). The batteries last a long time. It keeps the ipod nice and dry. It comes with an adjustable strap to hang it over the shower head. Just don't plan on being able to search for a song. The rubber over the ipod wheel doesn't make it easy to use. Clicking the wheel works just fine. It also has external power and volume controls that work well. It makes those early mornings a little more enjoyable.
4,Singing in the shower,This works great. My iPod stays dry and I can change music tracks easily. Case is a little bulky for hanging from my shampoo rack.
1,Pitiful sound volume,"I bought this for the bathroom for when I shower, brush teeth with an electric toothbrush and use a waterpik, all things that produce some noise that a device needs to rise above. The eGo Waterproof Sound Case cannot do it. When you get to the level where you can start to hear it better it starts to become distorted and may even drop in sound several levels, forcing you to bring it back up. This may be a good device for floating on a quiet lake when you don't want to disturb too many people. Otherwise it's a waste and I will now have to shop for another one."
4,"Great sound, convenience, but a little pricey","I bought this product for my wife specifically so she could listen to medical lectures while in the shower. The set-up is simple and quick and the construction seems solid. The sound is great and the controls function easily. We've only experienced one problem: the clip on the strap used for hanging the product broke the first time we used it. It really hasn't affected our ability to use the product, it was just annoying that the clip broke so soon. The clip holds the strap closer together to reduced the possibility of it slipping off of a hook or peg, but it really hasn't been a problem for us. Overall, it's a good product with good sound quality and easy to use, but it is a little pricey - $80. A better price would be around $50-$60."
5,Great product,"This is a great product. My daughter is using it at college and loves it! Shipping was quick, got it in plenty of time for Christmas. Will buy again."
4,pretty good,Speakers don't play as loud as I would have liked but overall not bad. I bought it for outdoor pool use so I am sure it works better indoors.
4,More individuality = better tribute album,"This is one of the better Bob Kulick/Billy Sherwood produced tribute albums. Rather than remaking the originals note-by-note, there are some unique variations here, and the quality of musicians involved is better than on many of their albums. In particular, they let the individual traits of the musicians come through the songs, so one gets Tony Franklin's fretless bass really singing along with a strong dose of Sherwood/Chris Squire vocal harmonies. Steve Lukather also contributes a fine version of SOYCD wherein he handles both vocals and guitar. Not essential, but a nice effort nonetheless."
1,barely tolerable for one listening,These guys should have picked some different material to cover. It all sounds like a teen age garage band trying to cover pink floyd.
5,Follow your ears to this shinning star,I bought this disc on the recommendation of a friend--she's still my friend! What a great mix of jazzy interpretations. The musicians are top notch and they are obviously having fun--the joy comes through on every song. I dare you to sit still during Little Drummer Boy! If you want something different to make your season bright then buy this CD!
4,Very decent Sci-Fi Cyberpunk-esq novel!,"I picked this up at a bookstore on a whim as the title sounded interesting. Turned out to be a little bit different than what I thought. I was expecting this to be more of a current X-Files and got something a little more futuristic. Not that this is a bad thing. Just expect more future tech than current tech.I thought the book read decently but was not completely smooth. I found sections where some of the action and descriptions got a little bit ""muddy"". It didn't stop me from finishing the book but I did find that I noticed it. Then again, from the authors description, this is his first novel. Heck, I wish my first novel was this good... :)"
1,Who could do this to Shakira?,"I'm not sure who came up with this idea. At first it sounded good, until I heard this women's voice. She sounds like she should be put in ABBA or something. This is a horribal CD. I wouldn't buy it. She ruined all of Shakira's songs!"
1,Tributes aren't supposed to [be weak]!,This is the most horrible rendition of Shakira's songs. Who is this woman trying to sing? I am sure Shakira would not approve of this [attempt].... This Cd is HORRIBLE! The worst part is she can't even speak Spanish!
1,It's a catastrophe,How can we let to do this ! It's a catastrophe... Buy the real CD's... There is only ONE Shakira !
1,Boring,"It's really not that bad actually... I mean, had I not heard the originals, I may have liked this more. But, I have heard the originals, and this is a sad remake of them. It simply lacks life. I can almost picture the singer kinda staring off into space... thinking about what she needs to pick up at the market while singing these.I'm not a Shakira fanatic or anything (I've heard her live and was extremely disappointed), but she did these songs much better. (Whether through electronic wizardry or her voice... I don't know, and I don't care.)I'd pass on these."
1,Wow this CD sucks so much,"Wtf is this? Was this woman on her deathbed when she sang this? This sounds nothing like Shakira, and I can't believe this album is an actual tribute. It sounds like they were trying to ruin her music. The spanish is HORRIBLE! In fact, it is so obvious that whoever sang this put on a fake spanish accent (which sounded terrible). I agree that it should be burned. Actually, the woman singing this should be shot, cut up into pieces, having her diced body parts shoved into three suitcases, which would be later thrown into the ocean. I really am upset about this CD. Anyone who thinks this CD is good should go kill themselves...right now. I'll help you if you want. I honestly wonder if Shaki heard this. I bet she cried. I love Shaki to death, and i can't believe someone would do something this horrible to her music."
1,A good laugh,"C'mon, honestly any fool would know better than to purchase this. Just play the clips and you'll see why. This should be in the comedy section."
1,wow..is all i can say,this cd is terrible im the biggest shakira fan ever and i couldnt even listen 2 the whole thing it sucked so bad..please nobody buy this it deserves to be burned
1,????What????is????this???????,"I dont know who-or-what possessd The people who made this recording it is T-A-R-I-B-L-E,I really dont see the point of makeing a tribute albem .All I see is takeing really good songs and re-doing them with krapey Instrments- for exsample-(the only instrments thay proble used were A keyboard,and a kareoke Machine)Shakira should be respected she put her hart&sole in writeing and singing these songs and the woman just ruined them. And where did they get those back-up singers-(proble escaping across the border from Mexico and they needed a little extra cash).I would recomend not to buy this albem is was proble put together in 10min.Buy one of Shakira real CD's and dont suport this woman,who ever she is."
1,Butcher!,"I only listened to the samples, but from what I have heard, it is terrible! The singer sounds like she is whining!"
1,who is this woamen trying to sound like?(NOT SHAKIRA I HOPE),"What is this?, some kind of joke.This woman is trying to makeShakira look bad.I think the sad thing is Iam a boy and I sound more like Shakira than this woman dose.I hope in the future that Shakiras tributes sound a lot better"
1,HORRIBLE,"Whoever this is can NOT sing Shakira... she ruins all the songs! I suggest not to buy it, and just buy Shakira's REAL cd's. I thought this was going to be a tribute by various Latin artists, but it's nothing as good ast that."
1,A very expensive coaster,That's exactly what this CD should be used for. Whoever this so called recording artist this is should have her vocal chords removed for the sake of humanity.This is nothing short of an expensive coaster or something to teach your dog to fetch.
3,Not the best of the series,"Ok, I don't want to give away anything about the book, but I have to say that I didn't like it very much. It was rushed. The author could have made this great, suspenseful, exciting mystery out of this book. Instead, she sort of rushed through it. It could have been much longer. Also, on the back cover of the book, it says someone starts threatening Sam. NOT TRUE! The person doesn't threaten Sam at all. In fact, the person doesn't even say one word to her. And you'd think that when the book cover had said someone started threatening her, they would actually say something, and say it more than once. I really thought that this could be a good book, because some of the latest books (14, 15, 16) have been really crappy, short, and rushed. I thought this one was going to be better. The first 13 books were awesome, and I hope Terri Farley gets back to her usual fantastic books."
5,"Simple, but informative....","Among the various TV home improvement personalities, Amy Wynn is one of my idols...she knows her craft! Ladies, don't be afraid to tackle home improvement repairs: this book is informative, has easy to follow instructions and clear drawings. So, get your tools and let Amy tell you how to fix it !"
1,Disapointed-Buyer Beware,If you do not have a previous version of Therascribe do not buy the CD Rom. I feel like I was mislead and ripped off. I thought I was getting something to help me instead I bought a pig in a poke. I not only bought this one but I bought the group planner as well. Same thing and I did not even get a book to go with either one.
5,Compassionate and Compelling,Not often does a book come along that captures the essence of awakening love and family like Jorge Luis Seco's. Every character's dynamic and passion plays out beautifully with clarity and truthfulness. Mr. Seco's writing is lyrical and haunting and I can't recommend it highly enough.
3,no power cord,I have got 2 of these of shipped to me and neither has a power adapter. Am I missing something here?
4,Actually works,"It actually works. My only complaint is that when I use it with my laptop, turn off the laptop's built-in video, switch to the other computer on the KVM, then try to wake the laptop... sometimes it doesn't work. But that is easily solved by leaving the laptop's display on.In response to another reviewer who noted a flicker at high monitor resolution: I noticed the same thing when using it for my laptop, but was able to solve it by turning up the laptop's refresh rate. (Probably this will shorten battery life, but to me it is worth it.) In Windows XP: Control Panels > Display > Settings > Advanced > Adapter > List All Modes... 75 Hz seems okay."
1,Worked for 31 days...one day too many...,"I would usually never spend this much money on a 2-port KVM switch, but this time it was important that I had a good one, and this switch got great reviews.I should have realized that the switches with the good reviews were mostly made several years ago. I bought mine on Jan 13. 2011. If it had died yesterday, I could have gotten my $60 back. But it died tonight - Feb 14. Now I'm out $60, and still need a switch.I guess when you're dealing with 30-day guarantees and cheap Chinese electronics, then you're better off getting the cheap items. It apparently doesn't make any difference."
3,No keybard based switching!,"This would be a great product, especially for the price, but it does not offer keyboard based switching. Most of these port switchers allow you to press some key combination (like ScrollLock twice) to switch. But, this one only works with the front-panel buttons. This is very inconvienent and a deal killer for me. Be forewarned. If you do not mind having to push a button on a box, it is fine."
5,ECG in Emergency Medicine and Acute Care,This is an excellent book for all Health Care Providers who use the ECG as a diagnostic tool.
5,So You Think You're Smart: 150 Fun and Challenging Brain Tea,"Wow...I planned on spending about a half an hour working on these challenging mind bogglers, next thing I knew I was depriving myself of many hours of much needed sleep and enjoying every moment of it. If you want a mental challenge and some real mental stimulation the key to maintaining mental acuity at any age then this is the book. ~Dr. RJ Shick, Winter Haven, FL"
5,Been doing the Yolanda series for a year. They're great!,"I have all three of Yolanda's DVD's and absolutely love them. I'm a walker, biker and do strength training (I'm in my 50's) and needed something for flexibility as I am not very flexible. I have rotated the three DVD's for the last year, doing one each evening. It has benefited me in so many ways. My balance and core have improved, I feel stronger and the tapes are very relaxing because they are calming and meditative. I have lost over 20 pounds in the last year and I feel that Yolanda's yoga has contributed to being able to keep the weight off. I had taken Yoga classes in the past and also have other DVD's but these have been my favorite. When you're somewhat inflexible, it can be intimidating in classes with other Gumby like people. These tapes have been well worth the reasonable investment. My only complaint is that I wish there were more in the series!"
5,my favorite yoga DVD,"This was my first experience with a yoga DVD, and I liked it so much that I've started practicing daily. I've since bought more yoga DVDs by other people, but this is my favorite. I wish I could find different ones that Yolanda has done!"
5,Simply Yoga~Great place to start,"I have the Simply Yoga DVD but I'm going to buy the book as well. This workout is uncomplicated and it works. Very easy to do for those who have no yoga experience at all. I tried a local yoga class and found it too fast,too competitive etc. I've lost 28 pounds doing my Simply Yoga DVD with Yolanda every morning! I wish she would make another one."
3,Ace of Hearts - Lon Chaney,"The plot was pretty straight forward: a ""secret society"" decides that ""an evil man"" must die. The movie was released in 1921, so the story idea lacked the sophistication, twists, and flashy graphics that we've gotten used to. Lon Chaney and the two other principal actors did their melodramatic best to carry the film. I give it 3 stars (out of 5), because the movie could've been better - but was entertaining, nontheless."
1,"Poor Quality, wrong size","Since I didn't get three astronauts I thought I was getting with the Mars Adventure Rover Set, I ordered this one to go with it. Since it was the same brand as the Rover Set, I thought the figures would be the same size. They weren't. And, before I was even able to give it to my granddaughter, one of the hands fell off. The helmets don't fit, and the parts that the figures are supposed don't fit in their hands. The magnet was the only cool thing about it."
3,still not installed,"still havent installed it as of today, due to pending a fuse. When i install it i'll write a review."
2,"Last in the Dayworld Series and Thankfully The End: 2 Stars, 324 pages, Publ 1990","Philip Jose Farmer wrote the first short story of this concept in 1972. In this last novel of his series, he's trying to prop up the series with non-stop action, but it just doesn't quite work. It's unfortunate, Farmer's Riverworld series was very popular, and additions to that series was welcomed. But as he started to write Dayworld in 1985, it seems he decided to write it as a series. It's too bad, because if he had condensed the entire series into one novel, it could have been quite a novel. But by approaching it as a series, each novel becomes more and more diluted, until you reach this novel, where you just want it to be over. There's no point in reading this novel, unless you've already read just about everything else written in science fiction."
3,Not A Bad Try,"Gordon just tries way too hard to sound American - take it from me (an American), it doesn't always work. My advice to him: don't try to be a chameleon on a piece of Scotch plaid - they burst themselves trying! Having said that, it's not a bad record at all - especially ""Someone I Knew"", ""How Wonderful You Are"" and ""There Goes My Heart Again"" are decent songs. If you can find this CD for less than $15.00, you might as well get it."
1,"Poorly organized, unedited one-trick pony","Sorry, but the description indicated this would be about jewelry making on the lathe. Instead it is a poorly organized series of photos and captions showing one artist's one technique for making one item: pie-shaped earings. This tale cold be told in a one-sheet: Turn a series of small, concave plates. Cut them into varying pies shapes & curves. Glue them back together in funky ways with earing posts. That's it. There is no more. Read it in one siting and returned it the next day. Trying another author on this subject and hoping for more depth & ideas."
3,"Really cool game, sort of confusing video clips","I own the Turbo Duo and I must say, I enjoy it very much. This title was, in it's day, the newest in the series of Madden football games to come out. The game play was fun. But, the full motion video clips were a bit confusing. I mean, the referee clips were cool, but what is funny is the players. You can see in the background that these are clips shot from a highschool in China, or Japan. The players themselves wear white helmets with no team markings on them, and their jersey's are just plain as well. My friend and I used to laugh at this all the time. Very cheesy. But, fun nonetheless. Good for a laugh. Not a serious football game like today's Madden games, but in it's day, it was pretty fun and unique."
5,the best of the maui guidebooks,accurate and extensive information. right on the money! felt it was WELL worth the space and weight in the suitcase.
2,"Good, yet not good enough.","This book gives plenty of background into international finance. Unfortunately, it has some big flaws, in my opinion. First, there are not enough calculation examples. Second, there are too few questions at the end of each chapter. In addition, you must go to the author's website for the solution. Once you get there, you will be surprised to find out that the author has only solved maybe two out of eight problems. That's annoying. I do not recommend this book. Take a class from another professor who uses a different text book."
3,Lacks cohesion,"This book has cursory overview of everthing and lacks detail. Also, each chapter starts well to get you excited on what you are going to learn and at the end of each chapter, you can't really tell whether it addressed the topics in enough details to give you the necessary understanding."
5,Someone to Love You by Kim Waters,"WOW, Kim came PHAT on this one. I have all of his CD's and even though I like his music, this one has that hip hop jazz tune that I look for when I buy my jazz. definite hit. CONGRATS Kim. let me know when you do your concert in D.C."
5,Love This Album for Smooth Jazz,I love smooth jazz and this is truly an amazing one. I have purchased several of his albums in MP3. He is truly a gifted person.
1,Waste of money,Complete waste of money. This is just a vocabulary book not a study aide. The author should be ashamed to sell this! If you are looking for a kindle study guide this is not it. I only gave one star because there is no option for zero. I wish I could get a refund.
1,Buyer Beware,"If you happen to have an up-to-date OS on your computer, take note that the CD provided with the text is useless and they do not provide current updates that are compatible. Considering my online course requires access, this purchase was a waste."
4,a great starter,"Taking a class in medical terminology, this pocket translator is a nifty little tool that accommodates ""The Language of Medicine"" quite nicely. The most used for me at this point is the English-to-medical, medical-to-English, common drugs, surgical terminology and abbreviations. There are some sections that I do not understand yet, but I am looking forward to using them. Between my kindle with medical and drug encyclopedias, and this little book, it is easy to get through an assignment!"
1,Blah,What a waste of money... This was not the direction I wanted my career to go. What a waste of money ha.
2,Just ok but save your money,Its good but not worth the money. There are better books out there. I have found many mistakes with the information in this edition. Either save your money or spend your money else where.
2,It's okay.,Some people in my class loved it and used it all the time. I didn't find it so useful. The information is very basic and most of it I could find on the computer at the hospital much faster than flipping through this book!
5,"Very helpful, medical terms at your fingertips","This is a great little companion to the Medical Language text and workbook. In the Translator all of the combining forms, suffixes, prefixes, and abbrevations are there at your fingertips. It is a great reference and small enough to fit into a pocketbook. I am presently taking a Medical Terminology course and the Translator is great to use during class."
5,Decent book,"What can I say, its a mini version of The Language of Medicine. It has all the terms and test and abbreviations. I have not had a chance to use it yet, but my professor who has been in the field of translation and interpreting for 16 years now, swears by it. Its even a great book to have if you are a native English speaker but cannot understand the medical mumbo-jumbo your doctor is telling you."
4,Money well spent,"Cracking the CBEST is well worth the money if only for the practice exams (but you get only two). Although I found them to be slightly easier on the whole than the actual CBEST, the peace of mind it brought me made this a purchase I don't regret. I wouldn't hesitate to buy this book (or another in the series) again."
5,I passed on my first try!,"After a twenty-four year absence from teaching, I decided to return to academia! This book helped restore knowledge I thought I had long since lost. By the time I finished reading it, I felt as if I had just graduated from high school! I was still nervous on the day of the test, but was relieved to find no surprises in the content and procedure. I don't think I would have passed this exam without the excellent review and tips contained within this book."
3,"Easy Test, book not neccessary for all","If you graduated from high school you will past this test. If you have major test anxiety, then it might help you, but other wise it really isn't needed. Most topics that are covered are ninth grade or lower in level. And even then, you only need to get around 60% correct in the math and reading portion to pass (in cali. no one will see the scores)"
2,Correct answers would be nice.,"The majority of this book is very useful, but I find it inexcusable to have at least two incorrect math problems, one in the graphing section and one in the quantifier section. 28 students took geometry in the winter, not the spring. How can you have no green marbles, yet have a collection of marbles, some colored only green? Also, some students might find it helpful if you explained the pi symbol just a bit before throwing it in. And the fact that you give a number for feedback that can't be reached from California, for a test in California is quite lame."
4,Like it,"It is warm and comfortable.I normally wear a size 6 or 6.5, but it don't have half size, so I ordered a size 7 after reading other reviews, too big for me...Perhaps I should order a 6"
2,Split seam right out of the box,"This is a really attractive and cozy boot, but the front seam was split when I received it. I wear a size 6 in sandals/high heels and a 7 in sneakers and decided to go with the Warmbat's website instructions and order a 7. They aren't just snug...my big toe is sore from wearing them around the house for a half hour and I doubt they would stretch enough to be totally comfortable. I was debating getting an exchange, but 7 just won't do and size 8 is all out. Oh yeah, they ARE made in China."
4,Good Knockoffs,"These boots are comfortable, a little cheap, and they're not as tall as they look.But I've worn them pretty consistantly the past few months, and they hold up well."
1,not all they're cracked up to be,"After only a month of owning the boots, the entire front seam on one of them ripped out and I had to return them. Luckily amazon didn't give me any hassle and gave me a refund. The boots are comfortable but very clunky. I would not recommend this product."
5,"cold feet?, no problem",these boots are very well made and the rugged sole on them is important as you don't want a slick sole out of doors.I bought a pair after my husband had ordered his and I saw how nice they were.
3,A Good Piece,"I thought this piece contains some material that should be seen by everyone, but then there was a lot of stuff that could have been left out. It was amazing to see how normal men turn into cold-hearted killing machines. Unfortunately, the book containted too many number and statistics which really took away from it. The book didn't do that well focusing on the main topic either, because it went off on many different tangents. I would recommend this book to be read though, because it is hard to believe that you or I could have a terrible amount of potential to murder people like the men in 101 did, and this book helps to shed light on the dark side of humanity."
5,A very carefully researched and written book,"The thesis is darkness lurks in the hearts of men. But I'm not sure it is that much. Remember the comment about the Nazis--the ""banality of evil."" Reserve Police Batallion 101 fits the definition. Evil isn't interesting. In that sense it isn't even evil. It is simply cruel, stupid, monstrous without insight or knowlege. As interesting and as evil as a meat grinder. But the Jews were the meat, and the men of the police batallion were the motor that ran the grinder.Some of the reviews compare the German policemen to the Americans against the Japanese in WWII or in Viet Nam.Big difference, I would say, between a caculated, deliberate plan to exterminate a race, men, women, children, virtually all non-combatants, and ferocity in war against an armed enemy"
4,Not all Germans were alike,"No punishment was ever given to anyone who chose not to participate in the mass killings. The question this book attempts to solve is, ""Why did Germans who were opposed to killing end up killing?"" The book is powerful when describing events and questioning actions, but boring when it is not."
5,A Very Good Book,"This book really makes one shiver. I have read a number of books on the holocaust and World War 2 and this book absolute is the rawest of the books covering the genocide. That is not to say the book had a blow by blow account of the methods of killing, but just the history of this group of solders and the off handed way the mass killing was described. The people doing this killing were just normal guys, not unlike friends, family or myself. That is what was so disturbing to me. It is much easier to think that the mass killing was done by some group of homicidal maniacs let out of the asylum and given guns that that is not the case. I do not think I can recommend this book enough; it really gives you a feel for the tremendous crime that took place. You will not be able to stop reading the book until you have completed it."
4,The ease of going with the flow...,"This book sort of explains the question ""how could normal people do such terrible things?"" or ""how could normal people act that way?"" - When those normal people are put into a situation that is abnormal for them and where they are the superior force there is no telling how far people will drift from their previous normal behavior and thinking. This book is very interesting in that it shows that most people will conform to even disgusting behavior if they start to feel it is the norm through indoctination, reality, or peer pressure. - . An interesting study of how people can be modified in their thinking and behavior."
5,A tremendous research effort,"This book is a rare combination of scholarly analysis and narrative style. It is equally good for the casual reader and serious student.The fact that Goldhagen lifted large portions of this book's narrative storyline should be an indication of how solid the research was. This information is a goldmine that Goldhagen stripmined for his own conclusions.Fortunately, Browning has a keen authorial voice and clearly draws his own conclusions on the culpability of Battalion 101. This is a rare, serious glimpse at the perpetrators of the Holocaust."
3,Easy Reading,A thin quick little book to read. Has great insight into a small unit and there activities in Poland. Has a few good maps. No material related to World War 2. This is only about this particular unit and there exploits in occupied Poland. Great cover.
3,How important stories get to be told the wrong way,"Another brick from the the Professors' classroom. I got to page 148, which was quite a feat, believe you me. But important it is. I don't deny that, and true too.Here's a token of the Professor's clear narrative style: ""The portrayal of German-Polish and German-Jewish relations in these testimonies is extraordinarily exculpatory; in contrast, the portrayal of Polish-Jewish relations is extraordinarily damning. If we begin by examining the first two relationships as described by the former policemen, we can better see the asymmetry and distortion involved in their account of the third."" Of the third! The third what? Do you know what he's taking about anymore?Please, give me a break, mister. I believe the Lord gives gifts and talents to every one of His creatures. You can pick to be a bullfighter, a fireman, or a professor. But pick right."
4,A Necessary Antidote To Goldhagen,I would say to anyone who casually read Goldhagen's book that this is it's far better researched and rational nemesis. It comes to more sound conclusions using more objective evidence. You would do far better to read this.
4,A MUST-READ SO HISTORY WON'T REPEAT ITSELF,"This book reveals how a military idealogy can transform shopkeepers, bankers, and any other average citizen into a killing machine that destroys men, women and children on the sole basis of ethnic background. It tells the truth about Nazi controlled militia groups executing the Jewish peoples and how they tried to cope with the reality of what they had done. It is a must read so history will not repeat itself."
5,The best KVM I've ever seen!,"This is absolutely without a doubt, the best KVM switch I've seen. It takes about 2-3 seconds for XP to recognize the keyboard and mouse however this isn't a major problem. What I do like is that because it's a USB KVM and not a PS/2 version, you can boot a PC while never actually switching to that PC to do so (which is something that really limited all manually switched PS/2 KVMs). I would definately recommend picking up this item."
3,Problems with Windows and MAC machines on same device,"I bought this switch about 2 months ago and I'm not terribly happy. I have 2 PCs and one Mac connected to the switch. When the Mac hibernates, the switch sometimes fails to recognize the mouse and keyboard - forcing me to re-boot the Mac. This is very frustrating. I dont recall any problems with the Dell and HP computers I also have on the switch.One more note: I sure wish there was a way to change port with teh keyboard (on my old KVM I could type CTRL CTRL 1, or CTRL, CTRL 2 for port 1 or 2 (respectively). I am unaware of a way to to that with this switch (although I have not done any searching for tips online).Overall - I havent returned the KVM, but I am not happy. My problem happens only once every few days."
1,Not What I was Expecting,"this book looks appealing, but it did not live up to my expectations. i find hoover a very interesting person and roosevelt even more interesting, however this book made their lives into a long, monotonous book that was hard to stay awake for."
5,"Real Reading, Real Writing review","Three of us in my college class read this book and we all really liked it. I found it very helpful, great ideas, easy to read, great author voice, etc. I only wish I could be the educator these authors are. This book is definitely worth the time."
1,Sensational,This book is a riveting tale of suspense and adventure. The ending made me cry. Beautiful!
1,Highly Disappointing,"This model is advertised as ""Snap Tite"" on Amazon. This usually means that no glue is required and sometimes the model is pre-painted. Neither is true for this model. It looks terrible out of the box and I'm not going to let my four-year-old loose with toxic model paints and cement. While many of the connection points have stayed together adequately without glue, several key ones do not; for example, the booster rockets slide down over pegs in the lauchpad, causing a gap between the parts. It is obvious that some of the connection points were not designed to snap together at all. The instructions are not in English, which wouldn't bother me too much, but they aren't that good either. The price was good, but in this case, you really do get what you pay for.For those who are picky about these things (and this should have been a red flag for me), Snap Tite is a registered trademark of Revell, not Academy."
2,A Bit Disappointing,"Not a terrible kit for a child's first plastic model kit, but definitely not a good one. It says ""Snap Tite Kit"" on the box top, but the instructions indicate glue on all five steps, and it is required or it will just fall apart. It's not well detailed at all, and it has eight parts that are not on the instructions nor are they necessary. They don't even seem to be part of this kit. Also, if left unpainted, the booster rockets (all three are molded into just two pieces) are a cream color and the shuttle is white and black."
2,Simple but not accurate,"This is a reissue of an old kit that Revell sold in the late 1970s/early 1980s. It's frankly pretty crude, with few details. Some details are wrong (e.g. the retro-rockets in the SRB nosecones) and the suggested paint and decal schemes are completely spurious.For kids making a first model, it may be a fun simple (and cheap) project. For more serious hobby modellers, it can be improved with kitbashing and some effort to match real-world marking schemes, assuming that you have a specific need for a 1/288 scale stack. Otherwise try Hasegawa's 1/200 shuttle stack kit instead (although it's more expensive)."
5,A Great Calculator,The calculator works well and i have confidence in Casio. It is easily used and I am satisfied with the price.
5,Best calculator I've ever seen,It's unique mathematical display is my favorite part. I bought one before. I lost it then and I bought it again.
1,The entry screen is too dark!,"I had the older version of Casio from 10 years ago. The solar panel decided to die out on me, so I'm forced to upgrade to a new one. I was glad this one was under 15 bucks but when I got to use the calculator, it was very difficult for me to see the entry screen (pixel or whatever it is called). The background tint is dark green and the color of the character is almost similar to the background, making it impossible to see the numbers! So disappointing. It's going back and start to look for gray pixel background color."
4,Extraordinarily Real!,"Author Ken Brown, has brought to life, the daily stories of so many young people that grow up in Urban America. It is understandable why this book means so much to him as it appears to have helped in purging. I applaud him for letting others into his life. It is a book of everyday struggles that teaches us all a meaningful lesson or two when it comes to interacting with people from backgrounds we don't fully understand."
2,Not really working well...,"I gave it a try 2 months ago, and I won't reorder again... It does not even come close to Carefree spa enzyme I used before - you get what you pay for.This one always let's foam form in the water and it does not fight cloudiness of spa. I am going back to care free spa - naturell , real deal."
2,Can't tell the difference,"Have used half the bottle thus far, and can't tell the difference in the hot tub water...Ironically, neither can the test strips...guess I will save the money and not buy it again."
4,Better than many day-at-a-time books,"Branden offers self-esteem and related insights as a daily psychological booster shot, from a non-metaphysical perspective.No God, higher power or higher self invoked. Whether you believe in Objectivism or anything close to it, or not, because of the non-metaphysical stance, this is a good book for the non-religious types seeking personal growth, recovery work or whatever."
5,BRILLIANT!!! BRILLIANT!!! BRILLIANT!!!,"I have always been a big fan of Kings of tomorrow and house music (lounge, deep, funky, you name it...), and therefore I listen to house albums with a very good ear. I must say, they have outdone themselves, and I've been thoroughly enjoying this album, the tracks are a fusion of so many different music styles which I absolutely love. So, if you take it from me, this album is a must buy...Hope you get is soon, so that you can be as lucky as I am...rea**"
4,Good debut!,"Kings of Tomorrow was a welcomed surprise for me! This one came out of nowhere to produce one of the best house songs this year so far! ""Make Believe"" is the song I'm talking about. It's catchy hook with its catchy lyrics just grab you. ""Another Day"" is a laid-back downtempo song that does a lot with its ""simple"" lyrics sung by an innocent sounding girl. ""Changes"" is another standout to me as well. Some of the other songs are kind of average, but the three songs I mentioned are worth the price of admission on this one. I look forward to hearing more from ""Kings of tomorrow""."
4,Exciting Page Turner,"I really enjoyed this book and am glad that there are no HMO's in Quebec. As exciting as the previous ones, couldn't put it down. Dr. Garnett is like a hound following a scent, he never lets up. I anxiously await the next round with Dr. Garnett et al."
2,Yuck!,"I found this book to be extremely long. You read a climatic point at the beginning of the book, which allows you conclude certain things, but are forced to listen to Dr. Garnet try to figure out stuff for 304 pages! It was interesting from then on and I quite enjoyed the ending. So if you would like to read this story, DO NOT READ THE PROLOGUE! I guessed a lot of stuff from it and I am 18 year old lifeguard!!"
2,Begging to be streamlined,"This book had some good parts, there's no arguing that, but getting to all of the interesting parts that add up to the moving line of the story is a difficult process. The Procedure could stand to lose at least 100 pages. Hopefully such a slim down would also help the main character be more consistent. Dr. Garnet shifts between a strong lead and a limp noodle, sometimes in the span of a single page.The Procedure is the kind of book you leave on an airplane when you're done with it."
4,Isn't This Guy Military?,"I got a hold of an advanced copy from the radio,and this is the most anti-military military book I've ever read. I give it 4 stars for originality, great action, and general cleverness, but if you want a by the numbers thriller, like was said, get a Kellerman novel or something like that. I'm not sure if there is a genre for literary action novels, but this would be the first--alot of Oscar Wilde in this. Also, anyone who is thinking of going to Antarctica will definitely like this book. Don't pack light. The description of the isolated continent, and the hero's life or death chase in those conditions makes for a great read. I ask if this guy is military because it says so on the back cover, yet there are alot of backhanded shots at the government in general. But then again, it's fiction. Look forward to the next one, if the market will tolerate books so difficult to classify. Bravo all the same."
4,Tantalus Zero,"This was a really enjoyable book to read.It was well written, action packed,and the plot was excellent. I loved the principal character- Falconer. I felt like I was right there in Antartica. I await Moore's next novel and look forward to reading more about Dr.Stephon Falconer."
4,"Great resource, a must-have for the Gaelic-curious!","A fairly weighty book! Only the more difficult Gaelic words are often backed up with a pronunciation though, unlike other dictionaries. That's the only thing keeping me from giving it more stars. I like the fact that several equivalent words are given in the English section, giving the user choices on which to use (and the curious user reason to research a broader vocabulary)Irish Gaelic, Latin and Old Norse roots are given where applicable, giving one insight to the depths of the language. Very interesting stuff!"
3,Tips to use the earphones,"I have had my sv-i700 since April 2005, which I use to lap swim everyday, I use the belt clip to a loop in the back of my swim suit and run the cord down my back. First thing to know about the earphone is to trim the earplug to fit your ear, I cut mine back two sections. When I have them in place I put the band of my goggles over the headband to keep pressure on them. After the first month, one channel went out, the wire breaks in the rubber boot. H2O audio sent me a new set of earphones (ipod white). This new set lasted another month and yes I do use the silcone as instructed. Then I decided to come up with a tie wrap solution to take the stress off the wire going into the boot. This seems to get at least two months out of the earphones before the wire breaks and I call in for a new set, I have gone thru 4 sets now. Not really sure what I will do when the one year warranty runs out, because I have become very dependent on having music to swim with."
1,not so waterproof,"Initially, this worked okay, but after a few weeks, i was swimming and all of a sudden my mp3 player stopped playing. When I looked at the case, water had seeped inside, ruining my mp3."
1,This product doesn't work,"The case is waterproof, I'll give them that, but the earphones just don't work when swimming. The plastic seals that *should* fit in your ear don't. They have hard ridges that don't form a water tight seal, water leaks in and you can't hear the music or the sound is muffled (even at 30, the highest setting).I wish I could return the whole darn thing!"
3,"Pleasant, unthreatening, Simply Burt","What a treat and just in time for the holidays! More From Burt Bacharat sends us all on a stroll down memory lane with such light and non threatening fluff like: Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head, What's New Pussycat?, Wishin' And Hopin' and the classic of all fluff songs: I Say A Little Prayer.The only song missing from this collection is ""anything"" from the film musical LOST HORIZON.This is the record that will make your mama proud of you!"
1,absolute garbage......0 stars,stay away from this albulm unless you are a junkie who likes to waste money
1,Miserable,"I love Pink Floyd more than I could ever describe, and I'm a pretty big fan of electronic remixes. That said, this album was absolute garbage. The remixes themselves were mostly decent, but nearly every track was ruined by exceptionally whiny and annoying vocals. The one exception is Learning to Fly, which is a wonderfully remixed, vocal-less track. But it certainly wasn't worth the [$$$] I paid for this album.."
2,"Ok, but...","Though I love Pink Floyd and I love electronic music this cd could have been so much better. If only they didn't only play mostly radio floyd on here. Not only that but there are NO Syd Barrett era floyd tunes on here. Thats a travesty in itself since Interstellar Overdrive and Astronomy Domine would have been prefect in an elecronic setting. Hell, any of the early floyd songs would have. And nothing from Saucerful of Secrets either. What a shame. Well its not terrible but I could see this being much better too. Oh well. Maybe make an early floyd electronic tribute. That would be nice. Theres no making electronic songs out of The Final Cut though that is a ncie album."
1,Worst Tribute Ever,"if i could rate this with no stars, i would. If you are a die hard Floyd fan like me, this is total disrespect. i see that it is supposed to be a tribute to Pink Floyd, well, first of all The Floyd are not electronic music i mean you dont take a Rock Song and make it into a Classical song, (although i have seen it work out good.) but you dont take a Rock song and make it electronic. then the music is all changed, if you listen to the little sound byte of oh say ""Welcome To The Machine"" hmmm its not the same song. so DO NOT BUY THIS CD. it is horrible"
3,PF for dancing.....,Very good electronic version of very good PF tunes set to dance tempos. Different twist but relatively good listening. Don't expect typical PF presentations. Different is good as no one will do it exactly the same.. thank God.
1,Is anyone else laughing?,You just have to laugh...it's that bad! If you are a fan - you will be pained by the massacre of great songs that takes place here. If you are new to Floyd... start with 'dark side of the moon'or 'wish you were here'....I beg you!
3,A new psychodelic twist of Pink Floyd,"""The electronic tribute to Pink Floyd"" is another philosophical dimension of Pink Floyd's music. Adding more dimensions to the complexity and power of Pink Floyd's music brings additional value to their work. This CD is a psychedelic experience in its own way for a new generation. The die-hard fans of Pink Floyd may find it inadequate at the beginning. However, we must remember that to listen to such type of music we need to prepare our state of consciousness. Have you? I found it to be a new experience stimulating many thoughts."
4,Great Jazz CDs for beginners!,"I bought this CD set when I first learn to listen to Jazz music. It's great & cheap! with lots of variety and good tones played by the celeb of all times! e.g. Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong, Billie Holiday and many more!"
3,Beautiful photographs,I purchased this book because I want to buy a Leiber bag - I was disappointed that it didn't have more bags pictured - there are so many! It wasn't so helpful in helping me find a bag I like - I still haven't purchased one!
5,Usefull Tool for PMP,"It is a usefull tool ,and the CD attached is directing one's vision to the key issues in the PMBOK.it is well versed and organised and gives a great help in cracking the PMBOK difficulties."
4,Good scoreboard,The scoreboard is pretty sturdy overall. You do want to pay attention to those book rings which tend to unsnap. I bought a box of good quality book rings and replaced most of the original ones and that fixed the problem.
4,perfect for our needs,"This score board was perfect for our needs. It folds flat and is easy to transport and store. The numbers were larger than I thought they would be and are easily seen from across the field. Ordering was easy and they came quickly. The only downside is when is is windy, the numbers flap around."
3,A Slight Winner,"I purchased this item for my nephew's lacrosse team because they didn't have a scoreboard at their games. When I asked about the score after one game, no one I spoke with was 100% sure. The good points are that this item arrived in a very timely manner, and it did serve the purpose of keeping up with the score. The red and blue colors, coincidentally, even matched the team's colors. However, I should have reviewed the dimensions better because it was a bit smaller than I would have liked. It also could have been sturdier ( it had to be leaned against a gate for more support). Overall, I was pleased with this purchase because it served its purpose and the price was right."
3,Not Quite Right,"I read this book and took the Security Design exam and didn't have the best success. The case studies included in each chapter were very helpful for preparing for the exam, but the exam itself didn't seem to require the knowledge of such detailed technical information that is included in this book (although I still found much of the information useful). I wish that this book would have included more general concepts and ideas (from a Microsoft perspective) than it did. I did pass the exam with this book alone, but just barely, and I do have some experience with Windows 2000."
1,Long hard slog for very little return,"I found this book to be an extremely long and tortuous read. I am experienced in NT4. The author tells you that a particular chapter will be very similar to concepts found in NT4 but warns agains skipping the chapter. After reading it, I found it was a complete waste of my precious study time. Other chapters are spent on concepts found extensively in the 210, 215, and 216 material ( W/S ,Server, and NW INFR). Fair enough that this material should be rehashed as it may be present in the 220 exam, but to waste whole chapters on this basic material is criminal. Of the 900 odd pages I believe about 700 is fluff and 200 is good material. Don't waste your money like I did. Go and get the Windows 2000 Security little black book by Ian McLean, along with some other concise texts such as the ExamCram book."
1,Don't buy this book.,"This book is absolutely full of grammatical and technical errors. One example, on page 474, is referring to a RADIUS server as a RAS server which changes the meaning of the entire paragraph. I would not advise anyone to buy this book."
1,This book didn't work for me,"This book just didn't interest me, to me it was just like trying to wade through treacle. I would pick the book up, read a few pages and then put it down again. If I choose to do this exam I will buy a different book and try again.I have done my MCSE 4.0 and 2000, and this is the worst book I have used."
1,Worthless,"I have enjoyed reading Roberta's articles in MCP magazine and thought that this would be a definite 'must read' for the test. Big Mistake! I did pass the exam, but I put this book down after the 4th chapter and never picked it up again. The content provided is worthless in the real world and even in Microsoft's world. If you need a guide for this exam, don't get this book. If you have problems sleeping at night, this is a great cure!"
4,Russian/English Book,"These books are small, and not as sturdy as most board books for little ones. Therefore I think they are overpriced. The story is cute and the fact that they present both the English and Russian words on each page is wonderful. My granddaughter is learning Russian from her Mom and English from her Dad. These are the only books that actually demonstrate to her that the words refer to the same thing and mean the same thing. It will help her understand that there are two different ways of saying the same thing."
4,Great baby book,"I'm Haitian so when I saw this book, I thought I'd give it a try for my baby. He really likes it and it allows for a lot of animation while reading. Definitely would by another creole/english baby book!"
5,Me encanta este libro,"""Donde esta el gatito?"" is great for toddlers, especially one like mine who wants to open the flaps and turn the pages himself. Not only does he get to identify the cat, but there are also everyday things he can recognize on each page- bananas, a toybox and a laundry basket. The Spanish version lets me practice a little Spanish on him (and me), with easy and a little more difficult words mixed together. I recommend the series in English or Spanish."
4,Whoever Fights Monsters,Although written in 1992 this work outlines the evolution of the VICAP program from concept through to implementation. It provides a hands-on insight into law enforcement's commitment to track and categorise violent criminal behavior. An interesting read.
5,Looking into an abyss,"I initially read this book when I was 19yrs old. For years I had read everything I could get my hands on regarding serial killers but none came close to this book. Now ten years later, I have yet to find a book on the subject that I thought did a more thorough job than this one. I was terrified reading it and found myself looking behind every corner and at every neighbor thinking he may be a serial killer!"
4,"Too much ego and invective, but still a good read . . .","If you can get endure the braggadocio and the thinly veiled invective that Ressler levels and some of his colleagues in the FBI's famed Behavioral Sciences Unit, this book deserves a place on the shelf with ""Mindhunter"" and ""Journey Into Darkness."" Of special note are the pages dedicated to the evolution of criminal profiling using infamous murder cases from the 40's, 50's and 60's. The serious student of crime will also appreciate the attention given to such things as what distinguishes a ""disorganized"" from an ""organized"" serial killer. It would have been better, however, if Ressler had left out some of the pictures in the photo section. Showing some of the victims of Harvey Glatman, Jerome Brudos and Ted Bundy was in bad taste, even if those photos have been printed in other true crime studies. Next time, Mr. Ressler, leave the ego, the invective and the victim photos out . . . the result will be a better book."
4,I found this to be very informative,"This book was very good, I loved reading about what goes on in the mind of a killer, and how they are profiled and caught. I recommend it to anyone interested in crime."
1,Don't waste your time,"This was one of the few books I couldn't even finish reading. All Mr Ressler does throughout his book is pat himself on the back. Everything that helped to solve a crime was 100% his idea, and everything that went wrong he gladly names the guilty party. He even adds irrelevant facts which have nothing to do with the storyline just to brag about something he wants credit for. This book is just one big ego trip for him."
4,Good Book,"I am a big fan of true crime books, and this one doesn't disappoint. Very interesting look inside the minds of serial killers, and some of the reasons behind their actions. I will say that Robert Ressler comes off as very arrogant and spends way too much time talking about himself and his early life before joining the FBI - I ended up skipping past some of it because that's not why I was reading the book. But on the whole a good read that will keep you hooked."
3,"works ""ok""","It works ""ok"" but as long as you use it twice a day, and while I used my ""O"" points to buy it, I would not buy it at the regular price since it does not work any better than a store brand of moisturizing lotion."
1,Disappointed,"This was the second supply I bought, but from a diff manufacturer. I was very disappointed when I started using it, it smells horrible! My husband finally said he couldn't take the smell. I did some research and found the product I originally purchased and reordered it. It has a very soft almond scent. The product does work, if you can handle the smell. I will not reorder from this manufacturer."
3,A Reissue Should Be Complete!,"This really refers to the version of this box set, not the product itself...the music is seductive, innovative, timeless and unique. The entire roster of artists on the 4AD label recorded these songs, and they are exquisite! However, the older version of the box set had a 4th disc with 21 songs from the original artists, plus a huge interior booklet with fantastic artwork! Why not release this disc, too, instead of offering 8 songs from it, plus 1 new outtake and one new live track? Is this worth buying this box again, no! If you don't have the original boxset, I would look for it used: the 4th disc is so worth it: like listening to the artists' ipods (to quote another review)...rare songs from the likes of the byrds, tim buckley, emmylou harris and gene clark. find the original boxset if you can..."
3,"Mr. Nexium, Cialis, etc, himself","Nice ride. Maybe not the sum of its parts. But is it strictly Naughton's fault? He started on Broadway and did very nice things there. His speaking voice is truly famous (unfortunately, over-exposed in so many commercials), his diction, ergo, stunning, and he sings warmly. But something in the whole is missing. A feeling of sameness perhaps? Your call."
3,Love the Kindle Version Paper - Hate that only one Kindle can view it!,*****I love the Kindle Version of the Press Democrat. It's the complete paper with out ads and pictures(well most pictures).*I hate that only one Kindle can view it! Might as well keep the paper home delivery so we can share it why can't we share a newspaper subscription between two Kindles on the same account?
5,Awesome book!!,This book is worth every penny! My marriage counselor uses this program and after reading the book and applying what we learned we really have not needed the counselor anymore. It is very straight forward and easy to do. It has brought my husband and I so much closer. I would love to give this book to every married person I know. I think it could lower the divorce rate in America.
5,Fantastic and Sensible Advice,"This book can be a phenomenol tool in learning how to relate to and understand one other. It is a very introspective course in learning what lies behind all the little things, as well as the really big things and how your own actions can be read, and misread, by your partner. It's an eye-opener. It does require the full participation of both partners, however. You BOTH have to want to do this. To do the exercises in this book, each person has to deal more with what they themselves are doing/ not doing and face it... then, to sympathize with your partner. It shows you how to look for the good and be open, little by little. It has great examples. I urge couples who want to make a real difference to hold hands and jump into this book with all you've got. The rewards could be untold."
5,Learn To Handle Difficult Issues In Your Marriage,"Fighting for Your Marriage helps couples ""learn to fight right"". It teaches skills for discussing difficult issues safely and clearly and using ground rules to contain destructive arguments. It also includes tips for enhancing the relationship with fun, friendship, commitment, spirituality and intimacy.I know when I shy away from an issue, it later becomes even more of a problem since it was allowed to ferment. Not knowing how to discuss difficult issues makes them worse."
5,Very practical,"Book offers a lot of practical advice, particularly how to effectively manage communication. Their method allows each part to effectively listen and hear what the other person is really saying in a very non-confrontational way. The book also really does good job of explaining many of the problems one can run into in marriage and offers very practical ways to deal with them."
5,required reading,My husband and I read this book several years ago. We both thought it was the best book we're read on the subject of marriage and communication. I recently sent one to my sister and recommend it to anyone interested in improving their communication. Should be required reading for anyone getting married!
3,"Good Material, Presentation Lacking","I give this book a ""5"" on content, and a ""2"" in presentation. It is just too dense - - too hard to read. Couples in crisis don't need to know how to build the watch - they need to know the time.So, in the interest of time, get a book by the same author, ""12 Hours to a Great Marriage."" It takes all this hard to digest theory and makes it workable. THEN, you can go back and read this theory after you've applied the good concepts."
5,Should Be Required Reading,"This book should be required reading for all couples getting married. If only I had read this book first, I could have avoided a lot of the bumps along the marital journey and saved myself and my spouse a lot of grief. Based on sound research and full of excerpts from real couples' lives, this book is now my favorite gift to newlyweds. It gives you great comfort to know that the arguments you and your spouse have occur in all marriages at different times. I highly recommend this to anyone who is looking at making their marriage last for the long haul!"
5,Great!,"This book helped us identify negative patterns in our marriage and by follwing the practical advise, we really raised our communication to the next level. All couples will fight, learn how to do it productively!"
2,The White Lioness,"I was so disappointed with the content of this book - I am south african and live in the Umhlanga area mentioned in this book...I was taken aback that Mr Mankell presumed to describe a cliff in the area ""from which the beach got its name"" ....what nonsense....Umhlanga is the name for the annual reed dance ceremony celebrated by the Zulu and Swazi nations....then to make matters worse Mr Mankell described the word ""springbok"" as being english and his interpretation of it for Afrikaans was ""spriengboek"" ....very odd - ordinarily I have enjoyed most of his books (except for the slow moving Dogs of Riga) so was really disapppointed at the poor research done before this book was written - if nothing else at least get the factual names correct !!!!"
2,could've been tighter,"I gave up on Mankell's previous Det. Kurt Wallander ""The Dog of Riga"" because of boredom and could've done the same with ""The White Lioness"" but finished the last audiobook CD too see how it ended. I really wanted to like this book all the way through but the lack of a good editor was overwhelmingly apparent for this reader.I love the way Mankell writes and the way he sets up a story. The plot seems to be overly ambitious and wanders all over the place."
3,Warning,"I will not review this intermittently compelling, but overlong book except to say that it is absolutely the worst place to start reading the Wallender books. Please do NOT read this book unless you have already read several other books in the series and plan to follow the entire arc."
4,Kurt grows on you,"This is one of the better stories involving Kurt Wallander. He has progressed from a rookie detective, to a competent one, to a really good one, all they while expanding his tendencies to play beyond the rules to capture the guilty party. In this book Kurt shatters the rules of conduct for a detective. The insight to the South Africa situation, pre-Mandela, was interesting but not really too surprising given the history of slavery in the U.S. All in all I thought this book was a very good read."
3,Artfo,Not enough of wallender too much of South African politics All other books great but this one was not what I expected glad it wasn't the first wallender that I have read.
3,The White Lioness,"The White Lioness is slightly different than the previous books in the Wallander series in the respect that the story is much more of a political nature. The story is partly set in Sweden and partly set in South Africa, after Mandela's release and towards the end of apartheid. It is easy to get immersed in the book, as the story takes an unexpected turn early on and carries on at a high pace. However, I found the ending disappointing and a bit weak. The way that the story was set up I had expected more from this third book."
5,The white lioness,"This is another great bookFrom Henning Mandell.. I have readAll of his books and watched his""Wallenger"" series on TV.This book adds a South AfricanAspect to the story which I foundInteresting.This gets a 5 star from me"
4,Absorbing book,"I generally take notice of reviews before I read a book, and based on some of the reviews here I might not have chosen White Lioness. However, I am reading my way through Mankell's works and decided to read it nonetheless. While I agree with some of the criticisms, I think on balance this is a thoroughly enjoyable and absorbing book. I like Mankell's style and his glimpses into a largely unknown Sweden are intriguing. Wallander is a very human type of character and this makes him more or less likeable at any given time.One of the things I like the most about Mankell's work is the sense of change in the works. He is not a formulaic writer and the landscape of his novels, both with characters and geography changes all the time. That keeps his writing fresh for me.I would soundly recommend the book and I will continue to read as much about Wallander as there is."
1,Too many mistakes,"There were far too many factual mistakes in this book. I live in south Africa and don't agree with Henning Mankell's assessment of the country and the people. I can live with this, but I can't accept the many factual errors. Even if it is a work of fiction, facts should be correct. I have enjoyed so many of his other books, but now I doubt how true the facts recorded there might be. Don't think I will read another of his books!"
4,Classic Wallander story,"As a fan of Kurt Wallander series, this did not disappoint. It shows the methodical and melancholy characterization of Wallander's analytical approach to solving crime puzzles, combined with his instinctive solutions. Henning Mankell is a story teller with whose stories it is easy to identify."
2,Not what I expected,"I must say that I was disappointed with this First Season, and from reading the comments of others, I may not care for the Second Season, either. Those are the only 2 I've purchased. I'm in my 60's and was glad I wasn't watching it with a much younger child. It certainly wasn't like my beloved Anne of Green Gables or the delightful series, Avonlea. The covers of both dvds show a happy Emily and that isn't the opinion I have of how she really felt in the series. It's a dark and scary story rather than the light- hearted other series I've enjoyed so much. I'm glad I only bought the first two dvds."
2,emily of new moon DVD Series 1 and 2,"I thought I had already done this, but here goes again. I am giving Emily of New Moon series 1 only, episode 1 and 2 only, 2 stars. This DVD is very disappointing, the dialogue is quite muffled and very hard to follow no matter how much we turn the volume up. I will persevere, but suspect the whole set will be like this. I cannot in all good faith recommend them for that reason. The scenery is wonderful, but does not quite make up for the faulty sound."
2,Not as good,I ordered this second series because I like the first one. This series is not near as good in content as the first season. But still I enjoy watching the adventure. They are all well actors.
2,Damaged DVD Case,"When I opened up the package, I found that the case was busted up and the movie label looked like it had been through a war. The DVD's played OK, but I had to purchase a new case."
4,Old manual on an old touch system,"I needed this manual for some research I was doing. Although it didn't have what I was looking for, it did have some other interesting facts in it."
5,The Personal Stories of Real People,"We are reaching a time when the members of the greatest generation, those that fought against the Nazi's and the Japanese are rapidly leaving us. It is good to see this series of stories from individuals who were there. By capturing their stories it may be possible for us to catch just a glimpse of what it must have been like to live when the country was more together than at any time before or since.As with the other books in this series, this book presents a rather eclectic collection of stories. All services are represented. And the story tellers are as different as they can be. Bob Dole relates the day he was wounded with the 10th Mountain Division. One of the Tuskegee Airman relates the story of a 'colored' pilot during the war. Chuck Yeager tells of being hit by German cannon fire and the propeller of his airplane coming off.This is a series of personal stories. It does not ahve the broad expanse of an integrated history, it's about real people."
5,Great insight into WW2,"Col. North does a great job of intermixing strait facts of history with the first hand accounts of the men and women who were there. It really helps bring the historical facts to life.I think this should be required reading for WW2 history classes, and is great reading for any history buff.Added bonus- it comes with a great DVD."
1,awful,"This is terrible. They are ""rerecorded"" well it sounds like a bunch of old men trying to sing songs better. Well they should have left well enough alone. This sucks! I love rock ballads & had very high hopes......So disappointed"
1,UGH!,"I can't stand this song. This coming from the same guy who wants women to shake their ""Money Makers"" and has ""H--s in different area codes"" actually has something positive to say towards women after putting out several female-degrading records? SORRY, BUT I AM NOT BUYING."
4,Eh...,"It's functional, it's matching. Somehow, and i'm not sure how, it collects some sort of deposit in the bottom of it. It's odd."
4,Looks great; holes are slightly small for fat brush handles,"When I opened the package, I was very pleased to find the toothbrush stand inside to be attractive and fairly well made! I placed it in the corner on my bathroom counter and thought, ""This looks just right!"" I placed my wife's toothbrush in the slot. Great! I tried to place my toothbrush in another slot. Ugh. My Oral B toothbrush had too fat a handle to fit. I admit, my toothbrush does have a substantial handle, but it's not a special edition or anything. I think there will be many people who pick up this stand only to find that their toothbrush doesn't fit. I'll try to post a photo so others can see my result. Meanwhile, I still give the product a 4-star rating as it is a very nice stand if you have a regular-to-small-handled toothbrush. If you have a thicker handle with the rubber grip, you might have to find something else."
3,"As others have discovered, the holes aren't big enough for many toothbrushes...","I was hopeful having read a review stating that the holed were fine. Unfortunately, the only size toothbrushes that will fit in it from my family are my 1 year old daughter's and grandma's. And grandma uses the crappy free ones that she gets at the dentist. Sure, there are toothbrushes that will fit it, but I think a lot of people buy the kind I do... with the *slightly* fatter (""ergonomic"") toothbrushes.Oh well. I found I could get my toothbrush to fit if I shove it through the whole from underneath. Not a big deal except the bristles will take a beating every time I do this. Oh well..."
3,It's OK.,"It's a toothbrush stand so what more is there to say about it? Well for one, it needs bigger holes because not all toothbrushes fit into it and also it collects water really easily at the bottom crevice and fills up with gunk really quickly. It's an OK product but not the best."
4,Perfect little utilitarian item,"The design of this is well thought out. Holes are plenty large enough for 'todays' toothbrushes; the base that catches the drips is non-rusting, durable, and washable porcelain; it's small about 3""W by 5""H so it doesn't add much to the sink clutter; and it gives the appearance of something of quality. Great little item. Glad I purchased it."
4,a gift,"I bought it for a friend, who saw it and decided she liked it. and she liked it when she recieved it for christmas."
4,sturdy and practical,"does not take up too much space, fits inside a narrow bathroom mirror cabinet and holds 4 brushes, great little product for the price!"
2,Alright for skinny toothbrushes,"I bought this for a new electric toothbrush because the description said that it can hold electric toothbrushes. It does not come close to fitting in this holder. The holder does not even fit children's toothbrushes, which are thicker than normal toothbrushes. It is pretty much useless for me at this point.On a positive note, it looks good. It would be good for someone with just normal skinny toothbrushes."
5,Works great,I used to have a metal base for a toothbrush holder. Big mistake as the inevitable water caused it to rust and stain my bathroom counter. This one has a ceramic base that will never rust. It also looks great!
1,Give me a break,"Author Shemin loves to talk about Shemin. Hey folks, here's how I did it, and you can too! Learn to play piano in seven days. Just buy my book, attend a seminar, yadda, yadda, yadda.Is he still selling pre-paid legal plans; a marginal, over-hyped product at best? This reviewer only questions the author about his decision to represent a product, the legal plan, that cannot deliver as promised (from personal experience). For my twenty dollars it causes me to question the usefulness of his book. Is it possible he is writing about what we, the readers want to hear-- like, how to be a millionaire? Forget about substance, sell the book! Just wondering."
1,Only For Complete Beginners,"This should only be purchased if you have never read any other book on real estate, if you've never spoken to someone knowledgeable about buying property, or if you honestly know nothing about the subject at all. And even then there are better books on the market, classes to take, websites to surf, or just talk to people. There are much, much better sources for even your first introductory information.This book is very badly titled. There are no secrets in this book. It is basic information. No one who already owns a house should purchase it. If you know how to evaluate the potential profits and losses of a venture, you really don't need this book at all.I can safely say, however, this book is not as bad as ""Rental Houses for the Successful Small Investor."" Both of them are 1-star though."
2,Full of Rah Rah Rah,"Here's all he should have put in this book, ""You can do it"" because that's all I found. Very little in this book was helpful to me, maybe that's because I didn't want to read a book that only talked about how great the author was and how you can do it too. Mind you, he didn't actually tell you how, but he told you he was going to, up until the end of the book."
5,Highly Recommended!,This book is a great read for all real estate investors and I highly recommend it!Lex Levinrad - Author of Wholesaling Bank Owned Properties
3,Another Swede speaks out,"Gunnar's (a typical Swede) review criticized this book for being narrow-minded, critical and cliché about Swedes and for encouraging stereotypes about ""bipolar herring-munchers who live deep inside the forest in little red houses without indoor plumbing.""Well, I'm Swedish, and I had a completely different reaction. Reading it made me feel like I was at home - it brought back so many wonderful memories and I felt it truly captured the Swedish spirit. Where he saw criticism of Swedes from the author, I instead saw respect and admiration. Swedes are different than others, but that's not necessarily a negative thing.And I completely disagree that there should have been more about the son. As a matter of fact, I could have done without the emotional drama and lovey-dovey bit all together.All I need is some good fishing, and to feel like I'm back in Sweden at Midsommar."
2,Kids May Enjoy . . . Any Real Highlander Fan Steer Clear,"1st 4 episodes of the kids' cartoon edited into a feature length video that kids may enjoy but any real Highlander fan should have nothing to do with. Story hardly worth mentioning, just Quentin MacLeod, the last MacLeod destined to be the one to rid the land of the tyranny of the evil Kortan. Of course contradicts its predecessors (and eventually its succesors as well) but who really cares this is just a silly kiddie show anyway. It would've been a lot better to see a Highlander animated series more along the lines of anime or the HBO Spawn series, or atleast the Batman animated series, but this drivel? I mean there's more action in Teletubies (OK I'm exaggerating a little--but only a little). Oh well what do you expect from the movie that has a long history of horrible sequels. However the later episodes in the series weren't nearly as bad, to say the least."
3,Love Overboard,"A short and sweet story,but excellent reading.We couldn't stop listening until it was finished.We enjoyed it immensly.Bill and Maryfrom Queensland AUSTRALIA."
4,classical music rocks!,"This is an interesting bit of classical music. Many types of modern music incorporate elements of classical compositions. From the melodic orchestrations of movie soundtracks to the theme melodies that pervade some albums, artistic influences can be be traced back to the great classical composers. The use of an orchestra is even coming back into style, most notably (and loudly) with some metal groups who play atop a partial or full symphony orchestra to obtain a characteristic 'big' sound. This new usage is even melodic and worth enjoying at volumes which are less than eardrum-popping."

4,Great Hungarian free-folk-jazz,"This is a great record for those of you who like inspired free jazz, or if you are into Hungarian folk music. It combines the two marvelously. Somehow, the mix of the two genres mixes very successfully. Particularly on a track like ""Bear Dance"", the violin-based folk theme gives a great groove for the song to unfold. Great solo's by Mihály Borbély. He is of the same generation of saxophonists as Mihály Dresch, but has a very distinct tone.Finally, I would recommend all of you to check out other albums on the Budapest Music Center (BMC) Record label, which generally gives an excellent selection of what Hungarian jazz is like these days (great!). Some personal recommedations:Bells/The Land of Boldogasszonyby György Szabados,Tótágasby the Del-Alfoldi Saxophone Ensemble, and obviously Dresch quartet'sArgyelus."
3,Earth vs. the spider / War of the colossal beast,"You must be a fan of old 50s ""B"" movies to appreciate the art of this type of movie. If you are a fan, like me, Burt I. Gordon movies are a must have item for your collection. My only problem with this set is, Why didn't they package ""The Amazing Collosal Man"" with ""War of the Colossal Beast."""
3,Kind of on the middle on this one,Acting was minimal. Never heard a spider make loud noises before. Other movie too slow moving for me. Glad I didin't pay too much.
4,Cult Classics: Earth vs. the Spider/War of the Colossal Beast,"Love that B&W. These are two classics, that are a must for hardcore collectors. Flaws a plenty, but that is the fun. The society reflected in these films are as rich as your memories. I tend to love the, ""shoot first ask questions later,"" attitude. Finding the, ""Amazing Colossal Man,"" is prerequisite. I'll just say, I found it on DVD (burned copy only). So grab your best girl, pop some corn, drop a peanut in your coke, and dig the rock'n'roll."
2,Cheesy Fun,"Beast is not as good as the first and Spider is typical giant insect. Check out The Colossal Beast's new bod! This is NOT the guy from the original (with the help of a disfigured face). All in all, chesey, low budget Saturday matinee fun."
3,It`s a good 50`s spider dvd!!..,Earth vs the spider is a good 50`s pic. you get to see the spider right off the bat that`s what i like. the colossal Beast on here is ok .but it`s not as good as THE Spider vs the Earth!! Good price for this dvd. and if you love them old Classics like me this one is for you!!. thank you.
5,Hammett: From private eye to writer,Hammett based his private eye stories on his own adventures as a private eye and invented the American private eye stories. But his life changed when he met Hellmann and during the red scare he suffered for what he believed in. William F. Nolan examines his complex life and what made Hammett an excellent writer and a tragic figure.
3,"Get ""Live in Buffalo"" instead","I bought this and ""Live in Buffalo."" I got rid off this one and kept the Buffalo one. The sound quality is much, much better on the Buffalo show CD."
3,"Lizzie Borden ""murderer?""","Lizzie Borden is a great story and I recommend it to every reader. The non-fiction story is great and informational, the story takes place right in our back yard. The book is easy and to read and if you like true stories that are interesting then this is the book for you. For me, the story was really hard to put down so I was always reading it at night in bed. Since this is such a short story you would look forward to reading it I know I did. I really enjoyed reading this story because it's not one of these books that everyone reads and is really boring and the ending was really un- expected. The main problem I had was picking a book but when I saw this certain book I knew this was the book for me. The cover the introduction on the back just the whole book brought me in. I really recommend this book for every one I and I really enjoyed reading this book."
4,A classic kids TV special well worth owning,"I love this video! Although primarily aimed at kids, like all the good material from this genre, it has something for the parents too. The songs stick in your head for days after, and although the kids in the show are somewhat bland, the Cat, Mr. Krinklebine (the goldfish) and Thing 2 and Thing 1 more than make up for it. My kids have to watch these at least once a day and love every minute of it. I also recommend the Green Eggs and Ham video."
2,Loosely based on the Cat in the Hat,"Diasppointing. Any Dr. Seuss purist will be surprised at the license taken with the orignal story. Theodore Giesel had a hand in the songs, which aren't even close to the text or the orignal zanniness of it all. The only similarity is that the Cat in the Hat makes a mess and he cleans up. No kite flying by Thing 1 or Thing 2, no balancing of the fish on a book or boat. Sorry I was misled by the title and Dr. Seuss name, which usually means quality stories. If you like 60's animation and silly songs, this is for you."
2,Why did the animated version depart so far from the book?,"The Cat in the Hat (the book) is a favorite of mine and my daughters (2 and 4). I love the rhythm and rhymes. I was disappointed with this animated version because it retains very little of the language from the book. In contrast, the animated versions of the Grinch Who Stole Christmas, Horton Hears a Who, and Green Eggs and Ham stay very close to the language of the books, only elaborating and tinkering slightly with the language here and there (and adding clever songs). The Cat in the Hat animated version, however, totally re-writes the whole story. Yes, it is cute, and wacky, and my kids like to watch it. But I see no reason for it to have departed so far from the book. The book is a classic and its language is perfect. Why change it?"

5,Great for convenience and portion control,"I'm disabled, diabetic, and have poor activity tolerance. Having rice that doesn't involve dealing with appliances (rice steamer) or dragging out pots and pans is great- it's also nice to have it 'ready' to just heat and eat in a hurry if I need to get something eaten without much time to cook."
5,So Convenient!,"These are the best! I absolutely love this rice. So convenient, fresh tasting and perfect portion sized. I throw in some veggies & my favorite asian sauce and I have a lunch or dinner ready in 2 minutes."
1,Very Disappointed & Scared,"I am very disappointed and scared. I love this rice, I love the flavor and the convenience of this product. However, the forth bowl I cooked in the microwave had a piece of ""GLASS"" in it!!! Now I am afraid to eat the rest. I am lucky I did not swallow it!!! I heard a crunch when I was chewing and spit it out. To my dismay it was a piece of clear glass!!! How the **** did a piece of glass get into the rice. I would really like someone to cantact me regarding this. I would contact the product maker, but am not sure how to go about doing that."
5,How do you eat leftover rice?,"I eat a lot of chinese food, and always have leftovers. Since it is nearly impossible to reheat rice, I bring my leftover chicken to work with a bowl of GoGo Steamed Rice. After 90 seconds in the microwave, it tastes like freshly steamed rice. Yummy!"
1,Tastes like plastic.,"I reheated this out of the plastic bowl--and even reheated in a ceramic bowl, it tastes like, and smells like, plastic; it leaves a bitter/sour plastic aftertaste for quite a while after it's eaten.Scaree."
3,"fine recording, Dorothy Kirsten is stunning","This is a rather lovely 1952 studio cast album of THE MERRY WIDOW starring renowned soprano Dorothy Kirsten in the titular lead role. Broadway fans will delight in hearing CANDIDE's Robert Rounseville as Count Danilo.As another reviewer has stated, the sound quality is quite awful (but I've heard cast albums that post-date this and sound even worse), however the ear easily adjusts.Dorothy Kirsten is absolute magic as Anna (or depending on the translation, Sonia, Hanna or Zenia). She is at her best with ""Vilia"" and ""I Love You So"". Robert Rounseville's voice is full and rich, as befits the role and the music.This is the Adrian Ross translation of WIDOW, which isn't the best. I still consider the Joan Sutherland studio album on the Decca label as the definitive translation. However, despite its shortcomings, thanks to Miss Kirsten, this is a WIDOW to treasure."
3,NOSTALGIA and more!,"but FIVE stars for the devine Ms. KIRSTEN!A highly recommended recording - quite rare for its period, and imminently enjoyable. The recording quality is not too great, but considering the period quite acceptable ~ an absolute must for the collector!The zither usage is especially effective![Sure there ARE other recordings, but this one has special charm]"
4,great. but only 3 of the episodes.,"this is worth buying if you are even a remote fan of tales from the crypt, however; it's only has 3 of many episodes on it. ""yellow"" is my personal favorite. they need to release more of the episodes on DVD so i, and everyone else who wants it, could have the complete collection."
4,All around good movie,"I found the movie to be well rounded. It was interesting, compelling, historical, and accurate as I understand Spurgeon's life. Not preachy, but the message was very clear."
4,Fine movie about a preacher,"Historically informative; interesting; delivered promptly, fine quality,valuable for Bible students; DVD itself fairly well done; I would orderothers of this type"
5,Interesting and well-done,"Interesting and well-done documentary drama of the life of Charles H. Spurgeon (1834-1892), English Baptist preacher, author and editor who also founded a pastor's college and an orphanage. With video of on-site locations, historical pictures, narration and drama, the viewer is provided a historically accurate account of Spurgeon's trials and triumphs and the times in which he lived. Including the role of Susannah, devoted wife of Spurgeon, adds an element of tenderness and serves to give the viewer the sense of a more complete understanding of Charles Spurgeon, the ""man."" SeeRobber of the Cruel Streetson the life of George Müller for another excellent biographical, documentary drama by Crawford Telfer."
3,My Start To LA Guns,"I had never actually heard a song by this band before I bought this. I had just heard of them by word-of-mouth, so I bought this. I think it's OK, but they cannot compare to their contemporaries. The first songs are great, and so is their remake of GNR's My Michelle(talk about weird!), but all the live material in the middle, with the exception of Over The Edge. But I can't understand: why didn't they put the original Over The Edge on here instead of the just OK live version. I dunno."
2,Not so great...,"The title on the spine of this book is ""the housekeeper's bible"", and that is really what it is, despite claims to be more generally useful. If you are looking for a book to help communicate with a spanish speaking nanny, try ""Bilingual Baby Care"" instead. This would be useful in dealing with maids and folks in restaurants, but doesn't have the words necessary to do much else."
2,Great for them but not for us.,"This book is (Bueno)for the spanish speaking, but it stinks for the english speaking. If I wanted English phonetics it would have been useful. This book needs to be titled ""How to communicate with your English speaking help& friends"" I need a book to help me with Spanish not English."
5,Spanish/English popular guide,"This is the most practical Spanish/English guide book I've used. I'm surprised that the author hasn't brought out a new edition, though."
4,Long Live America,We received these tags prior to a trip. These are sturdy tags with the american flag on one side and black on the other. You can pop open the back and be able to enter your personal information in a card in case the luggage gets lost. The Flag can be easily seen on airports baggage dispensers and that was our number one concern. I do not know how much more to say about tags so I will finish by saying that with the free shipping and handling option from amazon.com we felt it was a good deal.
2,Death By Short Song Sample,"Whenever I hear a song sample, especially when it is a DANCE MIX I NEED to hear the VOCALS to determine if I want to purchase it or not. SADLY Amazon OFTEN fails to deliver enough of the VOCALS on a sound sample. Quite often, there are NO vocals at all on the sample. THEY NEED TO WORK ON THIS. There is one vocalist in particular on these compilations Wienna I believe, who has a WEAK vocal range and they compensate by drowning the vocals. Be warned! MOST of the songs on this have mostly music samples. I do not care if you have the next electronica virtuoso arranging your MUSIC, because if you have VOCALS that sound like 2 cats getting their groove on... the song WILL SUCK. Amazon, please improve your sampling techniques as it is not fair to compilations like this one. I have, on blind faith, bought a few tracks. I will be posting an updated review to hopefully save the REST of you from buying a wack track."
2,Nice design... but the photo quality is strongly lacking,"I was strongly considering buying this printer - until I saw my friend's prints she made with it.I'm usually a fan of HP but I really feel they took a step backwards with the photosmart series. The only real drawback to this printer is the fact that it only uses a tri-color cartridge. Yup, there is only cyan, magenta, and yellow. No black! The way this printer makes black (or shades of grey for that matter) is by combining all 3 colors to form a composite black.This causes the prints to seem washed out and lacking dark contrast (not to mention using a large amount of ink). If you have any sort of darkness, shading, or greys in there, they will be represented poorly. Don't believe me? Go to a local store, ask to see the examples, and compare it to other printers."
5,Great product,"I got an hp325 for Christmas. I took pictures of the family opening presents with my Canon A70 and printed them out before breakfast. Quality is great. Took camera and printer to a meeting, took pictures and printed them. Everybody was amazed at the quality and very idea that I could print pictures right at the table. Haven't tried installing in computer. Why bother? I can download from card to computer with card reader. Love the portability. Getting our son one for his birthday."
4,Good Printer,"I got this printer not too long ago, and it has preformed pretty well so far. The pictures are good and it does not use too much ink, or so it appears. Again, the pictures are good quality, but they do take some time to dry. This might be because of the photo paper. I would suggest buying a usb cable as one is not included with the package. All in all, the cheap price and good pictures makes this a good photo printer."
4,Provides Great Insight,"This book provides a thought-provoking and closely observed depiction of the early 20th century South in which Miss Lumpkin grew up, and also tells her coming of age story. The author is keenly aware that, as the daughter of a ""good"" (meaning in this context: formerly plantation owning Confederate), Episcopal family, she was expected to hold certain views. The book chronicles her intelligent examination of the views inherited from her family, and her eventual rejection of some of those views. Inevitably, the author has included her observations about race relations, although I found her depiction of class differences among whites, to which she (as the daughter of a ""good"" family) was so attuned, much more interesting.Although she is never as radical as a contemporary reader might wish, she comes across as observant, thoughtful and warm. Highly recommended for anyone interested in a humane and nuanced view of the early 20th century South."
5,Horatio Hornblower #1 - The Duel,"I read all the Hornblower books as a kid. While these stories are new, they well reflect the original author. The lead actor is great as Hornblower."
2,Dark Blue Ocean and Dark Topography make difficult to read,"We bought the 27"" political globe a few years ago and my kids LOVED it27"" Inflatable World Globe - Political Mapping. Even adults are drawn in to learn geography. Yes it was big, but big is what made it so interesting. It stayed inflated for years until I let my kids play with it like a real ball. Lesson learned. I bought this one because it was cheaper and thought it would be equally educational...but it is difficult to read, and my kids couldn't care less about it...waste of my money."
2,Globe but not very comprehensive,I purchased this after reading comments from folks who claimed that it could be used for geography lessons. ----Well it is a lot less comprehensive than I thought. Doesn't show even major rivers or mountain ranges. It's ok if you just want to find current countries and a given continent but otherwise disappointing
3,HUGE,"This thing is giant. I bought it to entertain and educate my kids about their world, but I need a spare room for this world. I should have gotten the smaller size. The detail is good; major cities are labeled, but the country boundaries are very hard to see. Fun to kick around and show relative locations and distance, but too big to keep handy."
4,Needs a few regular puffs,"This globe is easy to read and has interesting details such as ocean currents. Unfortunately, like all inflatables, it does lose air, which in the case of a globe that needs to be read, becomes a bit of an eyesore in more ways than one. :)"
3,"Not completely what I expected, but a good product","I expected that the topographical nature of this inflatable globe would actually mean that there would somehow be raised portions of the ball where mountains would be. That's not really the case. I guess it's topographical because there is a different color for the different mountain ranges and such. Accordingly, it's not as realistic as I thought it might be from the picture. However, it is a good quality product. It seems to be well constructed and solid. It inflated easily and has stayed inflated. I'm using it in a store as a promotion for some products from ""around the world"". It serves the purpose even if it doesn't exactly look like a giant globe."
2,A beach ball,"This is a beach ball with a map printed on it. The polar caps are solid-color plastic discs. It would be hard to fully inflate it so that it was truly round like a real globe (and, in fact, the instructions warn against over-inflation). Full disclosure--my wife ordered this instead of a globe and she is pleased with it, while I would have preferred a globe. Maybe if it was made of premium plastic, showed the poles correctly, and had a stand that didn't emphasize it's beach ball-ness, it would be worth the price to me."
3,colors are too dark and form is not round,this ball has very dark colors and not easy to read any countries names.Form of ball is not round.
4,Very decent! I should know...,"I'm an audio engineer by trade and the specs for these speakers are pretty good for what they are, as I measured them. More importantly they sound rich with fairly accurate bass reproduction and the two mid/high range speskers sound crisp and clean. They don't crank, then again they are 3 inch drivers, don't expect to rock out. Although for the size they do a fine job. As far as portables that are reasonably priced, I recomend them."
1,Disappointed,"I only purchased this product because of the positive reviews I read on Amazon. The first time I tried the speakers with my new MP3 player I was disappointed. I did not expect high fidelity, but I also did not expect obvious distortion when playing classical music at a very moderate volume level. I tried adjusting the volume using both the volume control on the speakers and the volume control on my MP3 player, and either way I heard noticeable high frequency background distortion, sort of a slight buzzing sound. Maybe the unit I got was defective. I don't know, but I sent it back immediately. I would not recommend this product."
5,Great book which leaves you wanting more!,"I have every book Stephanie has written and everyone has been fantastic. Karyn's Memory Box is a very heartwarming story and is about Karyn's faith in God during the hard times. It is a mixture of romance, dispair, heartach, and patience. An excellent read!"
4,"An Enjoyable, Sweet Read","This book focuses on Karyn and Mikal Ritter, who lived in Nebraska in the 1800s. Karyn is a ""mail-order bride"" from Germany, rather disappointed to arrive in her little soddy on the plains, but like most romantic heroines, determined to adapt. It's a sweet little tale, with enough historical references to arouse my curiousity."
1,Not so much,"Being an adoptive parent of older children and working in the field of adoption, I found this book disturbing. The premise is good, but the story with content as ""Parents who knew not how to parent brought their virtueless children to the fairy sisters to have their magic bestowed upon them. and ... recently found a tiny girl child of about five abandoned in the forest by neglected and uncaring parents."" How many more ways can you tell a child they are worthless and I don't believe that is what really needs to be conveyed to a child. This is not a book I would ever recommend to anyone and I will assume the series is just the same."
2,Not worth my time or money,"Having read other reviews, I was really excited about this series. I have three children adopted from the foster care system. What I found is that each of these books would have played into my children's fairy tale view of the world, where all things are given to children without any effort or cooperation on the child's part. Also, the authors seem to recommend no consequences and a love-conquers-all approach to raising attachment disordered children. Oh, if only that would work! It doesn't."
4,A Great Space Saver,A great space-saver. Any scale modeler with several paint bottles needs at least one of these. I'm considering buying another and making small angle brackets so I can mount one above the other.
3,P. McKenna,Mozart's Missa brevis was well done but this Requiem lacked strength and passion. Colin Davis and the London Philharmonic performed an earlier work which still stands out for me.
5,Movie,"Very Well Done. Spectacular Special Visual and Audio Effects. This movie kept my interest until the very end. Kept me guessing, lots of twists to the plot. I do not recommend for anyone under the age of 15 without parent supervision as the content is quite shocking!"
1,They couldn't give it away,"I notice that Cassandra Sanchez has written 6 positive reviews posing as a teacher, a policeman, a doctor etc. But click on the about me link and they all use the same account!I saw this same behaviour when the film sellers tried to spam this film on schizophrenia.com. They posted reviews parroting the same ones they have posted before.The film makers may have had good intentions, but their marketing schemes are signs of desperation."
1,Very bad movie. Bad everything. Bad bad bad.,"I'm sorry to say this because I do not wish to hurt the filmmaker, but this has got to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The acting, camera work, and special effects are utterly ridiculous. It is a very very low grade B film that looks like it was shot with a home video camera with horrible -- well, horrible everything. The only reason I write this is because I wish to spare people the ( ) bucks they will have to spend on it. Especially because the people who might be interested in it might be mentally ill, or the families of mentally ill people. They should not be taken advantage of. There are better resources for them. I am sorry if this review causes pain to anyone who helped make it. There is a value to the film-- but it is purely a CAMP value. Seen in that light, the film is total campy fun. Almost like a bad horror movie is."
5,Transfer Switch,After a few multi day power outages in cold weather I bought a generator. I bought this 6 circuit panel to make hooking up the generator easier and to supply more circuits in the home.Before purchasing it you should define what circuits you want to have on the generator and of course you have to balance the wattage on the 6 circuits.This was easy to install and wire into the panel box but if you do not have experience working in a panel box you should probably get somebody that has to install it.Also you should label the transfer switch externally as to what panel circuits are on each transfer switch circuit.Haven't used it yet as we haven't had a power failure but I'm glad its ready to go.
1,expensive & dissapointing,"I am an ASQ certified Black Belt and a Six Sigma Trainer in Germany. I expected a good help for instruction but I was extremely dissapointed. This Kit contains no cd or disc with powerpoint slides. The contents are very primitive and not very helpful in training any students with a little experience in quality management. The name Six Sigma Training Kit is in my eyes wrong because it contains nearly only basic quality tools found in better publications. This time the name ""Juran"" doesn't guarantee quality. For 10% of the price buy better Rath&Strong's Pocket Guide!"
1,"Bad, bad, bad...","I bought this book because the AP Biology Prep Book from Cliff Notes was good. This book is not, though. After flipping through a few pages, I found that it's no better than a list of equations for each section. There were almost no explanation throughout the book, and of course that's not helping because by the end of the year, I forgot almost everything, so for a review book, this is the worst one ever. It's just a bunch of equations organized into a book. That's all. Fortunately, I bought the one from Barron's and it helped greatly. Barron's Prep book has more detailed explanations, and trust me, it worths the money."
4,start with peak hour divas...then fades near the end,"It definitely kicks into high gear with some of the hottest diva vocal anthems going, and stays that way for most of the disc, but the last 2 tracks bring things down a notch, which is good for a single listen, but if you're having a party, you don't really want the energy to stop. Some good length mixes here:1. party time (7:41)2. whatever (4:55)3. moving up 2005 (6:38)4. home (8:29)5. free your mind 2005 (6:09)6. pump it up (7:52)7. u ain't that good (7:37)8. naked fame (6:46)9. feel brand new (5:39)10. it's gonna take time (8:25)11. I Am (the rising) (9:07)"
3,Patchy,"What a shame. I own Freek Funk and worship that album, so thought Luke should be able to do better than this. It's praised for being ""varied"". I'd call it patchy at best, more like sparse. CD1 is only worth it for the last 5 minutes, which are incredible. CD2 starts off promisingly, slumps, has an amazing tune and then gets totally mindless, headachy pots and pans too close to your ears until another fine recovery in the last few tracks. Not worth bothering with unless you could sit through the likes of Hard House Update without getting a headache."
2,No Aikido here,"I also bought this book because of the ""Aikido"" in the title. Apparently, the author considers himself an ""Aikido sensei"" in the field of management in the same way that your typical sensei is a teacher on the mat. Unfortunately, most of us consider that an Aikido sensei of any sort needs to know a lot about Aikido. I'm not sure this guy does. If you've heard of this guy and want to learn from his extensive experience as a management consultant, buy the book. Otherwise, don't expect to gleam anything about Aikido here."
5,Literacy for Home Buying and Selling,"A very easy to read and understand book full of knowledge and wisdom about the purchase that can and does create stress and confusion in most people's lives. Explains and demonstrates ways for consumers to save money that is generally ""lost"" in the process. I have bought and sold homes for a number of years and never knew some of the information that was explained in the book. The web site listings for the various subjects is an excellent resource. It is the best ""how to"" book for the largest purchase of most people's lives."
4,Mixed bag of great music- alittle bit of everything!!,"Cannot do much better than Randy Newman singing his ""lonely at the top""!! all I gotta say!! A mixed bag of great artists and old sounds!!"
3,My Book Review,Living Heart Diet--I recieve book on time and it was in pretty decent condition for it being used..did have more notes written by previous owner then I liked -almost on every page..Didnt enjoy that at all.but again it was used ...all in all had a good expierence with buying a used book versus a new book..sad the postage cost more then the book tho...
2,DON'T SEE THE HYPE,"Kim's new single is good, it's just she sounds so different in the recording studio! I give this single 2 stars, I know Kim can do better, I voted for her on AI!"
1,Probably the dumbest song this year!!,"I heard this song and I thought ""what a stupid, insipid, uninteresting, and commonplace song"". What did you do, songwriter; say to yourself, ""Gee, I'm going to write a song with the words Eighth World Wonder in it"". And of course I'll get the lamest singer I can think of to sing it.DON'T BUY THIS ALBUM. IT ONLY ENCOURAGES LAZY SONGWRITERS INTO THINKING THE PUBLIC WILL BUY ANYTHING.Gawd, pop music just sucks, and has sucked since 1989. I'd even settle for a comeback by Gary Glitter."
1,DUMB song...,"1. the Great Wall of China, the egyptian pyamind...and oh yeah this guys that Kimberley hooked up with. And what is with the guy in the video, he is such a tool. On Ryan Seacrest level."
1,Awful,"While Locke isn't a bad singer, the material she's working with in ""Eighth World Wonder"" is simply dreadful. The first time I heard the song I believed it was a parody aimed at Idol-esque top-40 ballads. The rumor mill attributes the lyrics to the same writer responsible for the screen play for ""From Justin to Kelly."""
5,"Beware, True Talent Entering The Music Scene!!","Kimberley is truly talented and that is evidenced by this single. ""8th World Wonder"" was a bit different for me; I never pictured this stlye of music for her voice, but she pulled it off...This song proves that she is vocally superior to ALL of the pop stars out now. I absoutley loved ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow""...her vocal range is beautifully showcased and the song is given a contemporary makeover. I can't wait for her debut release and I hope it is not ruined by childish lyrics...the thing that set Kimberley apart from the other contestants on AI-2 was her youth and maturity...I'm just hoping her maturity is reflected in the material on her forthcoming album...She is definitely a star in the making...Sit back and watch her shine!!"
2,MEDIOCRE at best!,Just not good enough as Simon would say! Too much emphasis on the music and Kim does NOT shine through!
2,JUST OK Kim,"It's allright, but where is that voice from the AI show? Too much interference with the music. Too distracting, hope to hear your album is better than this single. Will wait and see! 2 stars only!"
1,It did not sound like her at all,The song is manufactured so much it is not a bit like her voice compared to her recently performance at TV shows. Very disappointed.
2,What did they do to Kim's voice?,8th World Wonder doesn't sound like Kimberley at all! What happened? Why mess with her voice and make it so generic?
1,Not what I expected!!!,"I was so hoping for Kims single to be awesome like the reviewers say, but it isn't! I bought it due to there responses, but it is just not good enough. I will not be buying the album if it is like this single!"
5,Kim is on fire !!!!!,I can't wait till May when her full c.d comes out i love her voice it is like a breath of fresh air in a world of music that sounds all the same i love Kim she rocks !!!!!!!i love every thing about the 2 song .. so diffent but so her !!! You Go Kim
1,LACKLUSTER SALES PROVE CD IS NOT GOOD,"I read an article in the paper today about Kim Locke and the lackluster sales her CD is generating. I like Kim but I bought the CD and was very, very disappointed. The songs are banal and trite and the producers just don't know what to do with Kim's voice. Its such a shame that television trash like ""American Idol"" is doing such things to impressionable young people. Every CD put out by every contestant tha I've heard so far....is just terrible. This one is no exception. It is overproduced, the choice of material is terrible and simply not to my taste. Perhaps the reason for the lackluster sales is that they are just not promoting it properly. One thing for certain, American Idol is doing some serious damage to these performers who go in with a dream and go out with a whimper."
1,Overrated non-talent!,"The girl is tone-deaf and off-key and she can't sustain notes; in short: she can't sing. She's untalented and fat, and as someone has pointed out, is better off in law school where she can practice her being obnoxious."
2,A disappointing start,"Sad to say, ""Eighth World Wonder"" doesn't represent a very good match of song to singer. While Kimberley Locke has a capable voice, she brings little emotion and less personality to ""Eighth World Wonder."" ""EWW"" represents a bid for commercial success without much artistic underpinning -- any number of female pop artists could sing this song and sound the same. Locke's more practiced version of ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" represents an interesting take on the song. She still doesn't demonstrate much interpretive personality, but does give a hint that she may offer something different to popular music."
4,Decent Debut Single,"Yes, its another American Idol. Yes, this song could've easily gone to Kelly Clarkson and Kimberly's voice can easily be mistaken for her's....but it's still a very strong song. It's a kind of uptempo-ish ballad with a strong pop melody and maybe just a touch of country. Strong pop ballads are a rarity and it's nice to see ""8th World Wonder"" pulling off some airplay. This a worthy purchase for AI fans or fans of good pop period."
4,Kimberly Locke,"""8th World Wonder"" is a great song! The first time I heard it on the radio I was amazed at how much Kimberly's improved since she was on American Idol.I would recommend this single to any Kimberly Locke fan, as well as any American Idol fan."
5,Simply Amazing!,"If these two songs are just a taste of the album then Oh.My.Goodness.The album is gonna be like the best AI album ever! 5 stars because 8WW is just Amazing, and SOTR is so not what I expected it's ever BETTER!!"
5,Sounds Like a Huge Hit!!!,"Kimberley Locke, 2nd runner-up from last season's American Idol, makes a solid bid for pop stardom with 8th World Wonder-the debut single from her upcoming album ""One Love"". Solid pop songwriting combined with a great hook and Kimberley's amazing voice make this an all-around winner. I cannot stop listening to this cd. The second track is a new studio version of one of her signature Idol songs-""Somewhere Over the Rainbow""-you expect it to be great and it is even better than that-a classy, mature vocal performance.Recently, heard a song from Kinberley's album at a Clay Aiken concert-a duet the two runner-ups perform (Clay sang the duet with one of his back-up singers). It was one of the best songs in Clay's set. All indications bode well for a solid debut cd from Ms. Locke."
3,"IT'S A GREAT SONG, HOWEVER","I think it is a good song for Kim's first attempt. She has a great voice, but I think there is too much digital enhancements with her voice. This is not her true voice. I'll buy the CD, because I like her."
3,great song but doesn't sound at all like her,"She sounds great but this is nothing like what we remember her sounding like. Song is great and she does it well. Doesn't show off enough of her powerful voice. Way to pop for me, but a good job."
5,a number 1 record!,you can not get this song out of your head once you hear it! will be the biggest AI single hit yet.i hope the whole cd is this good. does anyone know who wrote the song?
1,Little Giant (Big Disappointment),"The company that sent me the Little Giant bubbler that I had ordered via Amazon.com sent the wrong bubbler. I provided a model number from the original, which cross-referenced to the nozzle they sent (according to them), but it was less than half the size of the original and all of the fittings were too small to work (even with adapters). Very disappointed with their service, as I contacted them and was told they had sent the correct part and that was the end of the discussion. Would not recommended buying this item as clearly the folks on the other end are either mis-advertising or don't know what they are doing."
5,Awesome,"I found this CD in a random bin in a music store about 3 years ago.This Cd is one of the best various artist CDs I've ever heard. From an outer space feel to an underwater feel this is a relaxing, eye-opening adventure in chill music.I recommend this CD 100%.And don't forget to jam with the Cleveland Lounge at the end with some smooth jazz. Def one of the best."
1,Save your money!,"Once again, A&E/The History Channel tries to pull yet another fast one by presenting old, previously released material together in a box set and passing it off as something new. Be warned!"
5,Great recordings,"These selections of Schubert are among the best the composer can offer, and we also have Kempff performing them, so it's a double deal. In D.960 Kempff finds such a calmness interrupted by bursts of tension and passion. It is slower that others saved only by Richter and Arrau, but it never gets boring or feels dragged. Kempff's sense of phrasing here is marvellous.The shorter pieces (impromptus and moment musicaux) are nicely done. While you can feel they all belong to sets, Kempff also creates a sense of individuality for each piece.On the whole, I should say this is a very good introduction to Schubert and also a good item for Kempff fans such as myself. The sould is also very good for the time of the recording."
3,Too Self Indulgent,I am a bit tired of listening to music from these modern space epics fantasy film epics. Listening to the music it begins to sound all alike. This is nothing like music the golden age of the cinema. When you start not being able to tell the difference from John Williams' music from that of Howard Shore something has gone awry. Part of this is due to the performance of the Cincinnati Pops Orchestra. They have become too bombastic and flamboyant leaving forgetting the heart of the music. They have become too self indulgent for their own good.
5,Rocky Mountain High,"This book is the major source for both artistic and historical information about Adams, widely considered to be Colorado's finest impressionist landscape painter. Adams is best known for his stunning views of snowy mountain peaks in early morning or sunset light, or wreathed in storm clouds, and for his luminous twilight and sunset paintings of the river bottoms near Denver. For sample photos from this book, photos of his paintings, and additional information, see the Adams website, charlespartridgeadams.com"
3,Good,"I love Putumayo CDs.This one is good - not ""wow"", but good.There are a few good songs, but I was not that impressed.I've heard better flamenco, I expected a little more passion.But still, I recommend it."
3,OK for the Flamenco Novice,"Was dissapointed with the collection, but its fine for someone unfamiliar with flamenco greats like Paco de lucia, Camaron, Romero, and Segovia."
1,Do not buy it!,"It`s just a ""collection"" of OLD papers. You can get anythingin this book other sources. Ad hoc network is changing veryfast, it`s really a bad idea to publish things that willoutdate soon."
1,It was a mistake,"We bought this book for company work and onlyto realize that it doesn't teach us very much.We are looking for real content. Names of authorsdo not matter much to us. We are a major technicalconsultancy company working on state-of-the-arttechnologies.. Pls guys, provide more contentinstead of editing."
1,Not worth it.,"I bought this book since I thought it was the onlybook out there. However, I was disappointed as thisbook has little reference value. It is not educationalfor school use and also lacks flow. The author justtook some contributions from key players and bundledthem together. Perhaps the author is more into Mobile IPthan ad hoc networking. I had sold this book away asused item."
1,Poor Content,"Nice cover but book is too dry and content insufficient and not well organized. This is an edited book, NOT a complete book. This edited book is nothing more than a collection of papers. Really dry and there is no proper flow when it comes to reading it. The editor of this book does not seem to understand well how other protocol works and his comments are rather inappropriate. There are signs of favouritism. Also, the author should know by now that his AODV protocol has flaws. Perhaps his lack of formal PhD work hinders the completeness of this book. It is a good attempt but students and professionals could not benefit much from it."
1,This is a awesome camcorder,I bought this camera to make youtube videos with the audio is great and the quality overall its frickin awesome

4,More Fun Than Before!,"In a spate of recently rescued out of print cast albums,THE HAPPIEST GIRL IN THE WORLD probably benefits the most from transfer to cd. The sparkling lyrics of E. Y. Harburg are revealed in all their witty glory for the first time, and demonstrate how ably they were wedded to the music of Offenbach.Then there's the comedic bonus of Cyril Ritchard in his prime and singers who can actually sing, so the listener can enjoy a show from the 60's that is not specifically of the 60's, but a timeless musical comedy romp."
3,One of those fabulous flops - lots of fun,"LYSISTRATA is turned into a musical using melodies by Jacques Offenbach with (very) witty lyrics by E.Y.Harburg. The Show got decent reviews but did poor business and closed after a 3-month run back in 1961. Columbia records did this cast album and it has been a true collectors item since going out-of-print 30 years ago. Now, DRG has reissued it on CD.If you enjoy Broadway shows (or operettas) and are looking for something beyond the standard hits give this a try. The cast are all quite good (Cyril Ritchard is a devilish delight as Pluto!) and the tunes will no doubt be familiar. Harburg's best lyric is ""Never Trust a Virgin"" and there are several other gems."
5,Great set!!,I bought this grill set for my fiance. He absolutely loved them. They are heavy and extremely sturdy. I would definitely recommend them!!
5,Beautiful & Functional!!!,"Bought this set for my dtr.---She LOVES IT!!It is a very sturdy set and she uses all the tools. It is also very attractive, many of her friend commented on that.I am thinking I should have got one for myself too!"
3,Disappointed in Quality,"I bought this set for my husband for Christmas but we are returning them. I was influenced by the reviews posted by others but found the ""really big"" comments didn't apply. They are just average size -- we actually felt the handles were too short to keep your hands away from the grill. The metal was overall lighter than we expected giving the tools an overall flimsy feel. They may have changed the manufacturing or materials but these were sub-par. The price of $25 is the what kept the star rating above a 2."
1,Way too big,"I ordered this set for my husband and when it came in the mail I returned it. The set was way to big. I had read the reviews before I bought it and saw that some people said it was a big set, but I figured how big can big be. This set would be good if you have a really big gas grill and you cook big burgers, but we only have a small coal grill."
3,Great Item but may be too big,"I am happy with this product, but realize that these items are fairly large so you'll need a big bbq!"
5,A good mystery,"The makings of characters you'll want to follow in subsequent books, this is the beginning of some good stuff.Annie Szabo, her Gypsy mother-in-law, and intrigue..........Hilarious, suspenseful, tangy dialogue."
5,A wild ride in the fast lane of the future!,"Just finished reading SOULSAVER, and I'm sure Howie Happy I read it! Ingenious, imaginative, marvelous message, and extremely entertaining. Splendidly ""sin""ematic too!"
1,horrible!,"this is the most horrible deck since you have to sacrifice levia dragon-daedalus to summon your ocean dragon lord-neo daedalus. levia dragon-daedalus is the same thing as the ocean dragon lord, with 300 less attack. but it is easier to summon and it is much better. don't buy this horrible deck!"
4,Best Structure Deck to buy so far!,Dont Listen to the only other person who wrote a review about this structure deck. All The cards that come with the structure deck are great cards to use to an extent. The other person who did a review about this structure deck does not know what he is talking about by saying the entire deck is bad just because of the foil card. I am a Yu-Gi-Oh player myself and the other person would even regret writing that review if he was defeated in a duel with the foil card (Ocean Dragon Lord-Neo Daedelus). To add another fact to the other person making complaints about this structre deck being horrible: The Levia Dragon-Daedelus and Ocean Dragon Lord-Neo Daedelus DO NOT have the same exact effect. Konami/Upperdeck added an additional effect to the Ocean Dragon Lord with sending all cards on the field to the graveyard if he looked at both cards (excluding having to tribute a face-up Levia Dragon in order to summon Ocean Dragon Lord).
4,Finally my Sing Song EP is safe.,"Get this! If you are a fan of _The Church_ and do not have Sing Songs then here is your chance.Overall, Sing Songs itself is not a great album. It is still better than most but by _The Church_ standards it is deficient. However, ""A Different Man"" and ""The Night Is Very Soft"" make all the difference. Besides that you get Remote Luxury and Persia (which were bundled together as ""Remote Luxury"") in the bargain. ""Constant in Opal"" drives nicely and ""A Month Of Sundays"" lulls the listener into acoustic heaven. Add ""Volumes"", ""Violet Town"" and ""Shadow Cabinet"" into the mix and you have a total winner of a compilation.P.S. I rate hard so a 4 is exceptional for me.Get this. You will not regret it."
2,Headache,I wore this visor and it didn't adequately protect my face from the sun and it gives me a bad headache. I always have to adjust it on my head so that i get some relief.
1,Child molesters only need read,"I don't know which is more sickening - this book or the rave reviews for it, esp. the one that praises it for showing ""the positive side of man-boy love.""I saw the outstanding film by Gibson (whose movie ""The Passion of the Christ"" was a true masterpiece) then decided to read the book. What a difference! In the film we have a noble soul, the teacher, who has had his life ruined by false accusations. In the book we have a pervert who rapes little boys. There is no justification for praising such a book, no matter how ""eloquent."" Artsy-fartsy comments like ""literature shouldn't be poured through a moral filter"" don't justify it; nothing justifies it. The book should have ended with the teacher being strung up to die; that was the fate he deserved.[...]"
5,The Man Without A Face,"'The Man Without A Face' is a heartwarming story of a fatherless fourteen year old boy who befriends the town ""Grouch.""Justin McLeod is a former teacher who was in a car accident ten years before. Knowing he could never return to the life he once had, McLeod stays away from the public, going into town only when he needs to.Chuck Norstadt failed the entrance exams for Saint Mathews and needs to desperately learn the material for a retest after the summer months. He learns from his younger sister that McLeod was a former teacher, and goes to him for help.The friendship Chuck and Justin share is a heartwarming story for the whole family. Offering many themes to be learned and many surprises along the way.If you loved the movie, starring Mel Gibson in his directorial debut as Justin McLeod, then read the book. It's a heart gripper and a tear jerker, but bound to please. -Shanno"
3,Book < Movie,"My mother really liked the movie with Mel Gibson. When she read the book, she was disappointed. Now to be sure, the book is good. It offers some interesting insight into human nature. The images are fine and it does have some well placed comedy and tragedy. But in all honesty, the movie OUTDOES the book. Mel Gibson makes the disfigured teacher all the more profound and sympathetic. Also, Gibson deepens the story by emphasizing the tragic past of Justin along with his isolation. The book focuses more on Justin's ruined face. Gibson takes it a BIG step further and combines the biological, historical, and social scars. Don't get me wrong. It's a good book, but if you have already seen the movie,chances are you will be disappointed just as my mother was."
5,This was a must read,"This novel was a about a boy, Charles Norsradt he really dosen't know much about life being stuck with a family full of girls; he hates living with them. Feel like he's not manly maybe?He decides t o get away and go to St.Matthews a all-boy private school.He meets a strange man with a disfigured face Justin Mcleod, A writer and teacher, he decided to help him pass a entrance exam to get in,Charles takes to him and loves him and justin helps him like a father, but in the story the writer makes it seem more than father -like love, this story is very intresting and the charcters are complex this is a must read book"
4,Outstanding story.,"I won't add to the previous reviewers' applause for Man Without A Face except to say that I found the sexualization of the relationship disturbing -- Nabokov joins NAMBLA. The intimations of homosexuality detract from the themes of trust and redemption. Still, an excellent read and well worth the time. Parents should be prepared to discuss the sexual implications with their children."
3,The Man without a Face,"My book that I read was very interesting. I would not recommend it for kids nine and under, because it would not be appropriate. This book tells you about Charles, his mean sister Gloria, their mother, and a lost father. Meg was Charles' other sister, who was quite helpful. Chuck tried to get intoSt.Matthew's, but failed a few times. This time he's was really going to have to pass it, but Chuck was never the academic type. So he was really going to need some help. Now, Charles needs to ask for help. He never liked to be helped. Then, Meg has to hook him up with someone. She knows that the man without a face, even though he really had half a face, was a tutor. A long time ago, the man without a face tutored a boy. They were, o sorry. Why don't you just read and find out."
5,This Is Very Good,This was the first Bernie Siegel product I had ordered and I really enjoy listening to it a lot. Very insightful! You won't go wrong making this purchase. He can relax you so much and it really helps with my stress. Recommended!
1,Inane,"This is NOT a meditation CD, but rather Dr. Siegel speaking way too slowly, saying some things that border on ridiculous. You visualize walking in a garden, then into a house with a mirror. When you look in this mirror, you're supposed to visualize (he says ""see"") your inner self. Then you look around and ""see"" crayons on the table. You fold a piece of paper & draw a picture of yourself on one side of the paper. Then you open the paper and ""lo and behold"" (he actually SAYS that!) you'll see your inner self on the inside! There are similar mental exercises throughout, like ""meeting your shadow"" and learning, leaving the ""shadow always behind you."" Give me a break! He ran out of things to say, so he just decided to rant on about nothing. It is frustrating, not relaxing!I suggest Dr. Siegel's ""Meditations For Peace of Mind,"" which is more like meditation."
5,Fantastic Toy...,"I bought this for my daughter who is 4 1/2 and she absolutley LOVES it. I also had bought the polar bear snugglekins for my 3 year old niece with the same result- it was by far the most popular gift opened up on Christmas, even my nephews were begging to play with it. It makes the cutest noises and will ""suck"" on your fingers, baby bottles, etc. My daughter loves the little monkey bed. The kids just love it. It is super cuddley and soft. Would recommend this toy for all kids who love taking care of ""babies"". I got mine at a toy store for around $40."
4,I never tire of this album!,"Although I absolutely love this album, I do have to say that the track ""Wasted Time"" would have made this CD complete. Also, the songs that were remixed did sound better in their original form, and the live version of ""Beat Yourself Blind"" did not do the song justice. However, I really enjoyed the previously unreleased songs, especially ""Fire in the Hole."" I do not understand why others don't appreciate these songs! Overall, although I would have picked some different songs to put in this compilation, this is a must-have album. It's hard to get sick of!"
4,Good record despite some abscences,If you haven't purchased any Skid Row albums please buy this one. It has almost all the good songs from the bands most succesful records: Skid Row ('89) and Slave to the Grind (my personal favorite - '91). I miss though their 2 best songs that for some mysterious reason were not included in this compilation: Wasted Time and In a Darkened Room. This cd also includes some bonus tracks. If this record had all the good songs it would sure receive a well-deserved 5 stars.
3,Missing something...,"A Best of Skid Row album that's missing one of their biggest hits? Excuse me, but where is ""Wasted Time""? How could the group include a slew of live recordings and remixes, but leave out a bona-fide hit song? I just don't get it..."
3,An incomplete collection that both rocks & pisses me off,"Yet another compiliation that is a mix of bona fide hits and better left unheard filler. With only 3 albums and 1 EP, you would think they would get everything on one CD. +10 points for including Psycho Love, -10 points for leaving off Wasted Years. At first I was pissed to see ""Breaking Down"" was a remix but as best as I can tell it sounds like the original. ""Breaking Down"" is my favorite Skid song so I am glad they didn't screw it up. The live version of ""Beat Yourself Blind"" is an unintentional commentary on the decline of metal as Bach practically begs the ""wankers"" in the audience to make some noise. Use the skip button liberally and jam to the tracks that still rock and ignore the others."
3,Not quite enough for me....,"How can anyone not include these great songs:""Wasted Time""; ""Here I am""; ""In a Darkened Room""; Firesign.Skid Row fans must admit this is an incomplete compilation."
3,THE BEST OF-CUOLD BE BETTER,"Where are: Wasted time, Hollidays on the sun? These songs are great and the best performance of Skid Row as musical metal force and these songs are not here (because they weren't hits or best of?)The 2 non-previously released tracks are very cool, but the mixes(?) and demos do not add any value.It seems this Best of was done on the rush to keep Skid Row on the air for 1998 but nothing new.I hope the record company start releasing the Skid Row's Cd's with 20-bits technology and adding the songs not still available (also if merging some albums could be great, what about Skid row album + Hollidays on the sun + B-ourselves +Forever demo at 20-bits sound?What about Slave to the grind + Fire on the hole + Beggar's day at 20-bits sound?What about subhuman race + some great live songs at 20-bits sound at a reasonable price?The best time for release them when SR toured end of this year with new album on the road."
2,where r the tracks,skid row great and all but what about wasted time and in a darkend room and other great tracks and nothing from the ep bsides whats up so for that it gets only 2 stars
4,Good album but shouold have been 2 discs.,"This band is(was, now that the best member is gone) awesome. And just in case Rachel,Snake,Rob or Scotti are reading this, if you're going to put out a Cheap Trick like album, which is what i've heard,you guys suck and you are bigger sell outs than Metallica which is saying something.And by the way kicking out Baz makes me hate you. Baz was Skid Row, without him your records wouldnt have sold crap. Anyway, back to 40 seasons, looks like an attempt for Rachel to put some quick cash in his pocket, because he knows no one cares about him now. nevertheless Baz sings on 40 seasons so it rules."
3,Pudo haber sido mucho mejor,"Skid Row es un grupo muy interesante, ya que, como pocos, evoluciono desde un Rock suave con mucho virtuosismo en guitarra, gritos, rápido y entretenido, ha un grupo Heavy Metal de lo más puro. Todos los Lp's de Skid Row muestran una faceta distinta del grupo, todos son buenos, faltó CD para completar los éxitos, que ha mi gusto no alcanzan a llenar todo el gusto que un verdadero fanático tiene por ellos... por ejemplo debieron incorporar la canción Making a Mess, o In a darkened Room, Wasted Time, Creepshow y tantas otras. Debieron incluir más canciones en vivo y no ordenar las canciones por orden de grabación. Si a tí te gustaban las canciones que más se escuchaban de Skid Row por la radio, quizás te tengas que comprar el Slave to the Grind y el B-side our selfs para completar la colección."
3,Boring Album,"Ever since i heard ""Remember Yesterday"" i fell in love with the sound of skid row. Too bad when i bought this compilation i found out that it sucks and the band basically does to. if more songs would have had that high pitch, ass kicking rythm like ""Remember Yesterday"" than it would be worth buying.This band is no Def Leppard or Tesla, so leave this one alone...The cd just kind of drags out the whole time with some terrible vocals..forget it."
3,Coulda Been A Lot Better,"This CD should have included Big Guns. That is one of the best Skid Row songs ever, and this CD does not have it. Also, there are too many remixes and unreleased versions. Why can't it just stick to the only two decent albums this band ever released: Skid Row and Slave To The Grind. So therefore, this could have been a GREAT greatest hits CD, while it ends up being a mediocre one."
3,Should've been better...,"What's here is all good. The reason for the 3 star rating is for what's not here. It's missing ""Wasted Time"", and ""In A Darkened Room"" from the second album Slave To The Grind. They could've added ""Big Guns"", Sweet Little Sister"", ""Makin' A Mess"", or ""Here I Am"" from their first. At least one song from the B-sides EP should've made it on (Rachel's version of ""Psycho Therepy"" would've been great). The remixes of the Subhuman Race songs sound the same to me, other than ""Breakin' Down"" which they should've just left alone. ""Forever"" and ""Fire In The Hole"" are both ok previously unreleased tracks. This is a good cd, but with only 3 full length albums out, it's more worthwhile to get those instead."
1,bad communication,"cute shoes, good price but bad shipping price! I ordered the matte finish red shoes and then about 5 days later when i was expecting to recieve them, I was imfomed that they didnt have them in stock. so i got the suade ones even though I didnt really want those ones! they should have told me they werent in stock sometime around when i purchased them so i could have made a better decision."
2,"Space Ship One is Awsome, The Toy is Not.","This model rocket is Hard to put together, does not function like the real Space ship one (although I did not expect it to.), and falls apart easily. It is made of cheap plastic, cardboard, and Balsa wood. When put together it was relatively fun to launch, and watch it rise into the sky. But, you can only do it once because, even with the parchute, when it hit's the ground, the balsa wood wings snap off of the cardboard body."
4,Very Nice to Have,"All of the music and some of the dialogue from the (excellent) film. A must-have for fans of ""The Wicker Man."" ""Willow's Song"" was surprising to me because I'd not paid much attention to them while Britt was doing her dance. This song and the others taken by themselves provides more insight into the film, adding a new perspective. Well worth the buy."
1,Misleading description,"Thought this was the film, not the soundtrack. Please be more explicit in the future. Like Say up front DVD or better yet NOT DVD"
5,SkyFall,"This was a great book. One of those books that you want to read straight through. I guess, if they made a movie, the name could not be the same as the title."
1,Not a fun at all!,This product pretty much sucked! The water doesn't shoot out like it should. It was NOT worth the money. Returned the next day! Don't buy!
1,This toy bites!,"This toy is a waste of time and money. We could not even get the shark's mouth to standup. It keeps falling over because of where the fins are placed -- which is significantly differentthan the picture. The hose in the shark's mouth doesn't even work, and the water coming outof the jets on the side only sprays about 10 inches high. Poor design and poor execution.Wish I would have known this before I spent 20 minutes in 95 degree weather setting the darnedthing up. Just more plastic for the global garbage heap! It really is unconscionable to putworthless toys like this on the shelf. Do yourself a favor and don't buy it!"
1,Terrible and Disappointing,"Our family LOVES slip and slide products. The kids play hard on them so I'm never disappointed when part of it rips or breaks. The mega shark product however lasted less than an hour and we never got the shark to work properly. You must have completely level yard to do this on and I guess ours just wasn't level so the kids used it is a plain slip and slide without the shark. I bought a new plain one which the kids had a GREAT time playing with -- go the plain route, don't waste your money with the Mega Shark."
1,Junk!,"This was a waste of money and I promptly took it back. You have to have super, amazing water pressure for this thing to work, and even if you do, the slide part is not that wide and the ""movement"" of the shark jaw is hardly fun. Thumbs Down!"
3,Fun,"My son saw this on television and asked for it by name. We looked all over town and couldn't find it, but were eventually able to locate it a couple weeks after our first trip to look for it. It works just fine. The sprayer by the shark's nose sprays crooked on ours, so we just take the shark down at an angle so that the water hits the slip-n-slide itself rather than the grass.I don't think it's the greatest toy ever, or anything, but it does serve it's purpose and my kids love it. I would buy it again.I will say, though, that I have no idea why it's so expensive here. I bought it for $19.99."
1,Overpriced,$32 and $7.99 for S&H.Save; your money and go to a Mac store ora dept store with a Mac counter or their website and buy a lipstick for$14.50.Most Nordstroms have a Mac counter in them.
2,useful but dated,"Needs updating now.Great format, useful information but,a big BUT, some of the information is seriously out-of-date."
5,"Clever, pratical, sympathetic...","This book will guide you to the best of Paris.I'm french, and I well know Paris. trust me, It's a real good job, even for french people."
5,Good experience,"The used book, Sweet Dreams of Gingerbread, was what I expected it to be. In condition stated, and was shipped promptly."
3,It was nice,"I liked some of the ideas, i can always improve on them. I look forward to next Christmas season and holiday"
3,Great book for cookie decorating ideas,"I bought this book for more gingerbread house making ideas. Instead I got a book about making beautifully decorated gingerbread cookies. The only gingerbread house pattern in the book is a rather small plain one for Thanksgiving. There is really nothing wrong with the book, it just isn't about making GB houses."
4,Great but could have been better,"This is a great CD, but don't be fooled by the cameos it lists. Both RZA and Method Man only talk on skits...no rhyming from either of these MC's. Also, the track listing is somewhat different from the actual CD...for instance, LA the Darkman is on the song All We Got....which is one of my favorites by the way bc it tells a story about the group. If Killah Priest were still with them this album would have gotten 5 stars."
1,Not going to help family and friends.....,"I suppose it's good the writer was able to tell his story...But DO NOT read this book looking for comfort or hope if you have lost a friend or loved one. This story is a demoralizing portrayal of a life in pain. The lives of those we lose deserve a better memory than the actions and language this author uses. I felt it could have been said a hundred different ways, and all would have been better than the assaulting language and actions described in this book. People in pain do a lot of things that are not ""who they really are"". This writer seems to glory in the actions of those looking for peace and not finding it."
2,not what i expected...,"now, it's been quite a few weeks since i actually finished this book so it's not as fresh in my memory. especially since i've finished two since. but i do remember being thoroughly disappointed in the entire book. i think there was one paragraph in the whole book that actually meant something to me. the rest of it was just a boring look into the life of someone that really isn't that interesting. unless you want to read about the ins and outs of life in jail (which wasn't what i was hoping to see insight of) .. then this book is hardly worth picking up."
3,not bad for what it is,"I had hopes for better content for my interest, its a good magazine just not for me and my interest."
5,Good Story,This is a good book for Jr High kids. The story is dramatic and shows what anti-Semitism can do and what it is.
4,The Flowering Plants,"Intended as a coffee table book for every household, Heywood became in the 1970's the ""botany bible"" that opened the eyes of world-traveling naturalists to the magnificent diversity of the world's flowering plants . At long last we had a chance to identify that fantastic tropical tree and what it was used for economically. To this day, 40 years later, I consult Heywood daily with joy. I have bought crates of this book to distribute as gifts to my students. It is true that contemporary plant systematists are revolutionizing the world of plant taxonomy with new molecular data, and deride Heywood as obsolete. Family names and relationships are in a maddening confusing state of flux, will change tomorrow. Heywood provides great practical and professional information under the traditional family names."
1,Poor,I would have given them fewer stars if possible. Of course they are cheap. I should have expected such. None of the bits in my set are straight. Good luck on drilling! The larger the bit the more warped the shanks!
2,"OK, I guess, if you're 14 years old. Sophomoric.","Limbaugh uses some great parodies, but these are inferior to the more clever and musically diverse types such as ""Mellow Apathy"", ""Big John Huang"" and ""Lighting Up Lucky Strikes Again"". How many times can you listen to a guy who sounds ""something like"" Clinton sing off-key?"
2,Are There Different Versions?,"In addition to my above review, it seems like there were different versions. The parody of ""Spinnin' the Lies Away"" seems different than what Rush plays. The same applies for ""Friends in Asian Places."" The cd versions aren't nearly as good as the versions Rush had/has."
2,They Changed What Worked,"I really liked the Bill Clinton Comeback Kid Tour. This one was odd. The voices were very poor. The music seemed out of place. It seemed like the music for ""Dull Drab Man"" was as long as the part with music and words combined. Still kind of creative parodies, but not nearly as funny as the Comeback Kid Tour."
4,"Magnificent work, if...","Actually, it is the first issue that I have to say with satisfaction. This work is extremely considered as one of the best case study of one literature should be rendered. Though, it is too much with mythology and those explanatory stuffs contained at the first part which I didn't recognize if it works with the whole system of this book. However, the most fascinating part is still living inside the psychological approach to Peter Pan and how it was organized by its ambiguous characterization. Crucially, that's the chapter that you couldn't have missed."
1,Jungian claptrap,"Only a female could write a book like this, and an academic one at that. The usual disaproval of fantasy, imagination, youthful outlook on life, etc. I feel sorry for her kids if she has any, especially the male ones. No doubt they had to hear about the fakery of Disney, Santa Claus, and the Easter Bunny. Anti-fun and anti-life in general. A real snoozefest."
5,best since heartbreak bronco,"My daughter is currently telling me what to write about this book, so I am quoting from her: I think this is the best book written in the Phantom Stallion series since Heartbreak Bronco. Lately Terri has been skiving off and not doing as great a job as she could. Kidnapped Colt, to me, had a lot of unnecessary rambling and details. I loved that this book has Pirate on the cover. I bought it today and finished it today. This one is recommended!"
3,FIREFLY,I GOT THIS BOOK FOR MY FRIEND AND SHE LOVES THIS SERIES. SHE LOVED THE BOOK AND IT CAME IN A GOOD CONDITION. IT CAME TO MY HOUSE EXTREMELY QUICK TOO.
4,Phantom Stallion,I buy these for my niece who just loves horses. She would rather read one of these than watch television.
1,THERE WAS TEN PAGES MISSING in my book so i cant help ya >:(,i hateed it becaues i could not finish my book because i have TEN PAGES MISSING >:(
2,So unfair!,This book was sooooo disapointing. I hate the fact that Gabe is going to take Pirate all the way to Colorado! And he names the colt Firefly. Thus the title. But I've loved the colt ever since I met him in book 7 and was sooooo hoping he would go free or at lease be near. I am really mad that he went to a boy as well. Why couldn't Terri Farley make a new character. A girl of corse and have her become really good friends with Sam and live so near that she was in every book. And I wish the colt was named Pirate it was sooooo right for him. But noooo now he's going to be taken far from his home and far from the series and we'll probably never see him again.
5,Excellent,"This was a excellent movie. It was so inspirational, touching, funny and very entertaining. I knew the movie would be good but it past my expectations. The movie was awesome!!"
3,Moving into narrowed hall,"A story of Noah and his friends turned into an area of rather socio-psychological affairs has further been disclosed on a basis of a daily routine and possibilities the newest legislation the same sex marriage is, brought about.Personally, neither as usual nice performing of charming Noah et al nor soft-soft porn of muscular characters of all ages, add hardly an excitement to this philosophic happy-end drama rather than funny entertaining comedy."
3,Not Quite As Good As the TV Series,"I enjoyed the movie, but it did not quite reach the potential of the TV series. Some of acting in the scenes appeared strained. And it's completely unbelievable that Wade and Ricky would ever be curious about kissing one another - they did not like each other in the TV series.But for the most part the movie was very entertaining. I was glad to see all of the characters again. I'm sorry the TV show was canceled. It was a really good and memorable show."
2,Borrrrrring,"With Noah's Arc gone I was really looking forward to a feature film , one that would tie up the loose ends from the TV show. But what happens we jump straight a head to the wedding . I admire Ian Polk and think he is very talented- but it bugs me that he feels the need to copy SATC at every turn. Carrie got married - Noah gets married . Come on . Put your thinking cap on- write an original story"
4,Amazing,"I thought this would have been better than it was, but, it was okay, I gave it a 8 on the scale of 10."
5,Good condition,"I received the DVD in a very timely fashion, good condition, nicely packaged, would certainly buy from seller again."
3,Jumping the Broom,"Jumping the Broom was entertaining. The acting and the plot were just ok ""BUT"" I would have bought it anyway. There are not enough quality gay films out here and next to none with African American subject matter. Even though I felt things about this film could have been better, I was touched and could relate to the characters so well. I would suggest this film to anyone because it has relatability on many levels."
1,What in the world??,"I saw the two seasons and loved them. However, when I saw the first 10 minutes of this movie, I was bored to tears. The characters don't seem to be the same. I think that the writer should have done another season instead of a movie. This was terrible."
4,Good movie,I was very pleased with the movie because it answered the questions as to what happened after the car accident with Wade at the end of the series. Also I was glad that Noah and Wade finally got back together for good. It was good to see how all the charectors had moved on with their lives and kept a close relationship between them.
2,IT COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER!!!!!,I was really excited about seeing this movie because I was so into the tv series. It's very difficult to translate T.V characters to the big screen. I believe it was too bootleg hollywood. Some of the characters seriously overacted! Whatever happen between LOGO and the writer and creater Patrick Ian Polk for the show to be cancelled should of been left at that. This movie kind of tarnished the characters. I loved the T.V. series I even own the 2 seasons watch it over and over have the theme song sung by adrian evans on my ipod!! I enjoyed seeing the cast together again but it wasn't what I expected.
2,Could Have Been Better!!!!!!!!,The plot surrounding this movie could have been developed much more. There could have been more series of events. It was an O.K Movie
4,Noah's Arc,I thought the movie was fabulous and it makes me wish I could find my friend Larry. I loved his flare and that's what this movie has....FLARE! I hope the series comes back to Logo with a 3rd season! We were teased with two seasons and now we want more!!!!!
5,"Great movie, excellent quality","I had only seen a few episodes of Noah's Arc, so I didn't have much of a background about the characters before watching this movie. However, the movie was still enjoyable and the quality of picture, sound, and story was excellent! I would recommend this to any gay man who wants to watch a good movie (especially with his partner!)"
5,Great,"I am so glad that I order my Noah's Arc from this website, other website were out of it. I recieved it in a good time firm and I have already watch it twice. I have learn and it touch on elements that the same sex people face each and everything with issues of this world and of a re/ship."
5,Noah's Arc: Jumping the Broom,This movie was fabulous! I love it as much as I did when I saw it in the movie theater and of course it was sent to me on time and fast! Thank you!.
3,"Finally, somebody alittle more hood!!!","For so long we had to listen to female rap about 1 thing, their pus*y. Now I admit that Jacki-O does make a lot of comments about hers. But its more than how much she can get for it. She refers to her's as her best friend. There has been alot of comparison of Jacki-O to Trina, but with this album to me Jacki-o proves that the only thing they have in common is their love for their city. Jacki-o lyrics quickly surpass Trina's ABC style of rapping. That basic bad, fad, had, class, off glass, I gotta fat ass style is not present on Jacki-O album ( THANK GOD!).She's alittle more gritty and street than Trina.Trina is the cheerleader in high school and Jacki-o is the bad girl that skips school.It's just the matter of which one were you."
1,Jacki-O can get skeeted on,"Man, bump Jacki. She ain't nothing! She couldn't handle Gangsta Boo, Trina, or Shawnna in a rap off. jacki is so weak and she needs to lay off my girl Trina before Trina lays her up, you get it? Don't even think of buying this weak album. And, if you do, get it used, because I bet your bottom dollar it will go right back to that store. Little rich girl my foot. YOU BROKE, FOOL!"
2,Avoid this album. I mean it.,"If you've ever seen this woman's video for N***ie (the same song as P***y [Real Good]), you know this woman cannot rap. She makes Charli Baltimore and Khia look like Biggie and Tupac. Her rhymes are comparable to the worst St. Louis-based rapper ever, J-Kwon. There are other female rappers out there, and most of them can rhyme better than Jacki-O."
3,DISSAPOINMENT 4RM FANS IN MIAMI FLORIDA PERIOD,IMMA BE HONEST SHE REALLY NEEDS TO GO AWAY SHE HAS NO IDENTY NOR SHE IS NOT THE QUEEN OF THE SOUTH TRINA IS BUT I DONT LIKE FOXY BROWN BECAUSE I THINK SHE HAS A BIG EGO TO I THINK JACK-O IS A FAKE TRINA AND THERE IS ONLY 1 QUEEN OF MIAMI AND THE SOUTH AND THATS THE DIAMOND PRINCESS SO SHE NEED 2 GO SIT HER OLD A** DWN SUMWHERE ONLY SONGS I CAN SAY SHE RIPPED WUZSLOW DOWNGANGSTA BITCHT.K.O (FOXY BROWN DISS)SUGARWALLSDATS ITDONT GET THIS ALBUM WASTE OF MIAMI I DNT EVEN SEE IT IN STORES ANYMORE LOLGET TRINA ALBUM GLAMOURS LIFE IT IS FIYAH
1,Jacki who?,"I cant believe this b**** actually made an album. This b**** and her lame album are pure trash. How the f*** is the b**** underrated? She isn't Kim, Foxy or Trina. Plus, this c*** is way to old to start out in the rap game.AND HOW DARE SHE STATE THAT SHE BEAT FOXY BROWN UP. I KNOW FOR A FACT THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN."
2,Another Lame and Cumbersome Piece,"This is becoming an annoying habit - buying and returning annoying products for the Nano 1g.This thing is a tangled web of woe and despair - bulky, unattractive, and functionally not good in terms of accessing the iPod's wheel through the plastic.The arm band is a piece of junk. The belt clip is OK but obviously cannot be removed as stated. It is, however, a HUGE clip and will raise it off your arm by at least an inch.The best band I have found so far is the Belkin F8Z153-KG, but it only works for the 2g, alas. Almost nice enough to make me want to buy the 2g. Or say to heck with them all and let my 1G get some dings and scratches. Or better yet, buy generic mp3 players instead of this Apple hegemony.(Returning this item.)"
3,Hawaiian Leis,"I bought this book specifically to learn how to make one Ribbon Lei for a Girl Scout fundraiser. Having never been to Hawaii, the overall book of designs I was somewhat disappointed in, however, it is perfect for my origianl purpose. Those who have traveled there and are aware of the customs and culture of the islands - I'm sure would be very interested in this book. I do hope to visit our 50th state in the next few years."
1,yuck,From the sound clips most of the songs sound good. But when I heard 'Sail Away' I knew that wasn't Enya signing. I won't be buying this CD. I do like the other Moods CD a lot better!!
2,All the same,"The music is all the same, no difference between the songs. It is not what i expected and was disapointed when listening to it all. There are far better collections out there!!!! Dont waste your time buying this rubbish."
3,Price was okay.,"I got this at Wal-Mart, where I work (I got a discount), so I am satisfied with it's price. Most of it sounds nice, but, there is no listings of the original artists of this music. I don't really like the rendition of Sail Away (which is really called Orinoco Flow), because of the person with a squeaky voice trying to sound like Enya."
3,"This is not ""Pure Moods""","Shall I Begin with a fact that this is not a part of Virgins ""Pure Moods Collection"". This is a 2004 release by Big Eye Music with no association to Virgin Records. It was repackaged as a MP3 format - Download only re-release in 2008 as ""Yoga & Body Moods - Deluxe Edition"" the listed group is Yoga Masters. This seams to be their only album they have listed to their credit. The odd number disc was combined into disc 1, as the even number disc was combined to create disc 2. If you just like to have a background noise as you read a book or just relax then this might do."
1,Disappointed in customer service - still waiting for item,I received this item on 2/16 and the bottle was half empty. Had a difficult time reaching someone. Tried twice on the phone. Left Voicemails. No response. Tried email and received a response. Was instructed to send the item back. I paid for return shipping via UPS. Item was received on 3/2 by store and it is now 3/15 and I still do not have a replacement item.
4,Good instruction book,"Even though this book is out o print, I wanted it badenough to pay the extra price. It has a multitude of information on preparing to weav rag rugs."
1,Ripped off!,"I can not believe I paid $85 for this book! It was paper bound, bent wrinkled edges and some pages had old stains on them....never again will I order like this again!"
4,Helpful,I learned quite a lot from this book. Janet Meany was so gracious and helpful when I contacted her.
4,Rag Rug Handbook,"Good book for beginner -- focussing on techniques peculiar to rag rugs. all the set up & process illustrations are hand drawn rather than photgraphs -- mostly in black and white. The photographs of projects are mostly in black and white, a few color. Not very exciting visually, BUT excellent, easy to understand and follow directions for process and pattern reading. Projects seem to go from beginner to elaborate. I am glad I bought it."
5,Great Rug Book!,"I recently received this book as a gift and have found it to be just what I was looking for. It clarifies the various methods of rug making, along with tons of great diagrams and easy to read (and follow)instructions. Plenty of photographs, tons of great ideas and methods of creating a unique rug for any need. Worth the time and money. Beginner - intermediate weavers will appreciate this book!"
2,Not really necessary,The shoppers guide is the best and most helpful tool with the book! I bought this just to have all the tools to help me but haven't used this at all.
3,A hipster history lesson,"Originally released as a limited edition of 500 vinyl-only copies, this album is a hipster history lesson of sorts. The main selling point is that the DFA produced the first two tracks in 2001, long before trucker hats hit Williamsburg. Accordingly, these tracks are like Rapture outtakes, albeit in Japanese and with less structure. The rest of the tracks are charmingly badly recorded psychedelic electro freakouts; ""Kajiroudou"" could easily fit in a Jon Moritsugu movie. Influences and references abound (Can, Public Image Ltd., early Sonic Youth). The story of this band's formation (American moves to Japan to teach English, meets Japanese musicians, hijinks ensue) is a highly entertaining read on the Mesh-Key website."
1,Poorly executed,"The idea for this book was a good one. Unfortunately, Cooper has no sense of humor and little writing ability. I'm afraid I abandoned the journey in Australia."
1,Read Twain instead,This is a transparent attempt by an untalented writer to use Mark Twain's name to sell books. The book doesn't merit enough of my attention to write more.
5,"Great Headlamp, definitely recommended.","This headlamp is very comfortable and not heavy at all. You forget it is even on top of your head. Buy a couple sets of rechargeable batteries and you are set for this thing.One thing i wish is that all 5 lights could turn on at the same time, but it is very bright with the 200 lumen main lamp without the others on. Did races in the middle of the night with this and it worked great going quickly through rough terrain."
5,decent,"used it at night while hiking/camping. the battery is much lighter weight than the alternative (the ""non-pro"" lamp takes a bunch of AA or AAA batteries) - and this one is CR123 (either one or two), and that makes it lighter. it was nice to have the middle strap at the top which is adjustable, so the whole thing won't slide down. it did not malfunction at 16,000-19,000 feet in sub-zero temperature, while being used for about 5-6 hours continuously. my other uses of it were in much more favorable conditions and for shorter time durations. i did not use this product during a rain (mostly because i had no need)."
5,Worth every penny,"Excellent headlamp. I use it for lighting my area while driving a tow truck. It's bright, comfortable, and effective. By far the best headlamp I have owned..."
2,Caver Headlamps,The battery type is not very common. Cavers require 3 sources of light. Standardization of battery types enteres into this. I did not notice the battery type when it was purchased.
1,Piece of junk,I had to use it to restore some files I had backed up on it. About 5% of the files were corrupted. I lost valuable photos and documents.Thank you Western Digital for the crappy product.
1,Trash!,This is the second Passport drive bought at BustBuy at their sale that has just stopped being recognized by either my Mac or PC. I'll get them all set up for either my photos (first drive to go) or my music (the one that stopped working last night) and it'll work fine for a few days.... then kabooom. no drive. Just doesn't show up as being connected. I've been super careful to use the safely remove hardware on the PC and to eject the disc properly on the mac.Just thought I'd point out that the drives were both 160gb usb drives.forget these drives!
1,WD 60GB Passport 2.5 External does not work with PowerBook G4 by Macintosh.,WD 60GB Passport 2.5 External does not work with PowerBook G4 by Macintosh.The PowerBook G4 computer will not recognize this product so Passport cannot function as an external drive or to download data.
2,Great Drive But,"Great Drive but I had to buy an external power source so that it would work with my Dell D600. Just to be on the safe side, I would budget in buying an external plug. They say it doesn't need it but that wasn't true for me."
1,WD 60GB,I had high hopes for this drive. It was said to be compatible with MAC and PC.The MAC OS X recognized the WD but it never functioned.THe PC recognized it but speed was very slow.
2,Again with the Power Supply,"I just wanted to confirm that the power supply is necessary for many computers, especially laptops. If I wanted to use a power supply, I can get a bigger external HDD for the same price (so I did). Note that my 80gb iPod works great on my laptop - so its not impossible for a large-ish HDD to be powered from my USB ports.Almost EVERYONE should be concerned with this. Why? Well, if it works on your computer that is great. But if you ever need information off the drive when your computer crashes, you run the risk of not having one nearby that works (or that it works on your new computer). Second, if you want to transfer some files to a friend's computer, it may not work.WD should just ship every unit with the power supply, or solve the problem so that no one needs it."
1,WARNING!! Not compatible with Powerbook,"Although sold for the Macintosh, this drive apparently requires too much power to be driven by a Powerbook USB port. It works on desktops, but failed to mount on two different (15"" aluminum) Powerbooks. The manufacturers position is that if it doesn't work, you should buy an external power source which must plug into the wall"
4,Very useful and portable,The drive has been a good companion since I bought it and has not showed much problems. Sometimes it takes a little delay to get recognised after I connect it to my dell notebook.Data transfer is speed is excellent.
1,NOISE NOISE NOISE,"I'll have to agree the drive is easy to setup and use, however, you'll have to get used to the noise. There is no ON OFF funtion, no SLEEP mode. The drive has to be turned off, and unplugged each time it's used. WD has a sleep utility for download but it doesn't function, with my system.The spinning noise is annoying and to make matters worse the spinning causes a noise viration or humming noise on my wood desk. Double trouble. If noise isn't an issue the drive works as advertised."
5,Add Seven Sleeps to your Christmas Story Collection,"Stuart Adams' charming compilation of letters from Santa Claus offers readers of all ages new insights and pleasures with each read.Seven Sleeps Until Christmas is about giving the gift of ourselves and the ongoing discovery of oneself in the context of our relationships with others. This book reinforces important values; it emphasizes creativity and imagination, being with others and sharing, and the joy of giving.Some of the things that make 7 Sleeps a thoughtful book, are its attention to details...Santa's handwritten salutations, the font, and a built-in display stand. These sweet details make it a favorite and easy gift to give to teachers, family members, and friends.(***So far, each copy I have ordered from Amazon.com was signed not only by the author, but also Santa Claus himself!)"
2,Laborious Writing,This editorial type writing is not one of my favorites. I finally put the book down after giving it a good chance. There are much better books on the subject.
3,To live alone?,"The Tony Blankley proposal is quite radical, without diminishing the big truths of his reasoning. If you are on a human rights defense, definitely is not a book for you. If you agree with the extreme right, and truly believe the richness of big empires is done by the sole effort of their inhabitants, you will love it. Radical Muslims, as radicals of any name, are not good for the human development, but certainly the reasons for being radical should be addressed too."
4,Review of The West's Last Chance,"A scary book, which appears to be carefully researched. Easy to read and digest; probably would be a good idea for Americans to read this."
1,A must read,This is a thought provoking book that everyone should read. It is frightening and we can already see parts of it coming true in Europe. The book discusses the clash of civilizations in a very understandable way and should be in every thinking person's library.
1,A giant leap backwards for mankind,"The elements upon which this book is built are as illusory as a house of cards. Though seen from one angle it appears to be strong and solid, in truth it is about as substantial as a hot air balloon.I despair for civilisation when a book based on the fear-mongering of one group in society is hailed as 'superb'. It is a bleak day indeed if we must accept that multiculturalism is a myth. Can we all get along only if and when everyone is the same? Are we nothing more as a species than a community of ants (though infinitely more destructive)?Do Christians even believe in the golden rule anymore?Do not let fear rule your life, your beliefs, your humanity."
2,Shallow fiction compounds public ignorance inflames passions,"Aura of authority from psychology of the moment with fictional American politician is reinforced by consultation with expert in European art to provide the basis for fictionalized polemic to encourage paranoia about Islamic takeover of Europe. Author sources on and understanding of Islam shallow at best but he uses his skills as hired gun for politicians to create new fiction. Implication of how and why Islam might grow in Europe is right there with those who later scream that riots in France were entirely Islamic extrtemists rather than disadvantaged, unemployed, youthful minority. One needs to at least ""understand the enemy"" first. This mediocre fiction massages bias, shows ignorance, and appeals to those lacking depth to match their passion against Islam or their paranoia."
1,Another Slanted Rant from Regnery Publishing,"Regnery makes a living out of publishing one side of the story. This is red meat for its audience which seems to be much more conerned about having its ""feelings"" validated than getting all the facts. If you simply want propoganda to reaffirm your biases, Regnery provides it as in this book. If you want to know the truth about Islam, warts and all, read Bernard Lewis. He paints a picture that has many dark spots but keeps in context that 99% of Islam (like 99% of American gun owners) are law abiding and peaceful people. Mr. Blankley would like to suggest otherwise, but lacking the facts to support such a view he cannot outright state it. So instead, he takes the acts of a few and seeks to create a general bias out of those acts in much the same US gun control advocates point to a small number of handgun abusers and seek to create bias against all gun owners. It ain't fair and it ain't right in eirther case."
3,A few flaws that I couldn't look over.,"I'm 14 and love fantasy and medieval books so when I heard of this Trilogy I read some reviews and went to pick it up at the library. Unfortunalty, though the story was good, the author Hilari Bell had to add a bit of profanity in it (though mild). For me, it took away the quality of the writing and the story. And thus, earning it only 3 stars.The story line was pretty good though as said before, a bit cliqued. So maybe it would be best to think twice about reading this books."
2,Slow and too long,"I read The Goblin Wood by Hilari Bell before I read this, and so I was really looking forward to it. I ended up very disappointed. This book was long, slow and cliched. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
4,A Great Book,"I'm 18 and I got this for Christmas. I was kind of reluctant to read it, because it did not look like I would enjoy it. However, I was pleasantly surprised. This book was well written, and I thoroughly enjoyed how she told the stories. It's not random, like some of the books I have read. Children who are into fantasy, warfare, history, or sci-fi will love this book."
5,Good Start,"Probably the best thing that this book did for me is to make me read the sequel. I applaud the way this book is structured because it set the stage for a fast paced, truly inspiring sequel. That being said, on it's own this book is choppy and very puzzling. You must understand that if the sequel had not answered my questions and filled out the characters a bit, this would be a very different review. Kavi is very dislikable, and Jiaan is a goody-two-shoes, but they both evolve in the next book (Thankfully so does Soraya). My advice for all the people reading this book: purchase a copy of the next book and read them together. You will see the reason I am giving this 5 stars."
3,Historically significant,"I'm a huge fan of 50s horror and sci-fi but found these a little weak. Don't get me wrong, I'm happy I bought the set, but these are both better suited to collectors than to anyone wanting an entertaining film. If you're new to this sort of thing or just a casual fan, the Midnight Movies double feature The Return of Dracula/The Vampire, or the Sam Katzman collection (featuring The Werewolf) are both better choices. If you're a die-hard fanatic (like me) buy this one too!"
4,Blood of Dracula,"I have waited a long time for Blood of Dracula to come to DVD. In the mid-1990s I had a VHS version of the horror classic and, being the age I was at the time, enjoyed the campy fun as well as the chill of horror. I suppose this film plays on every students idea that his/her teacher is experiementing on them in one way or another.If you have a young horror fan in the family this is a safe movie to enjoy as a Halloween treat and certainly has some history in their about the Arms Race. There is also a corny musical number that the family will enjoy laughing about before getting back to the vampire thrills.Happy Hauntings!"
1,False advertizing,"It always gets my goat when an exceptional band's name is modified just enough as to not get in trouble, yet draw the attention of fans of said band. I havn't even heard this album, but now I'm less likely to listen to it now that they've had me look at this page thinking it was another FSOL release...I guess it's kind of like Macdonald's advertizing regarding their vegetarian menu, stating in very small print that these ""veggie"" products most likely have come into contact with several meat products.The ""Fast-food-ization of the ""developed"" world continues."
5,Great Children's CD,"While visiting Bahai House of Worship, they had a visitors center where I came across this CD for $15.00. I'm so pleased with the purchase and wanted to review it. It contains affirmations/hyms from different parts of the world, so not every song is in English. Each song has a different child reading it as classical music is played in the background. Each song is approximatly 1-2 minutes in length and love the idea that my son can enjoy listening to such positive and lovely music while learning affirmations. You can preview the songs on Amazon's MP3 version of this cd."
1,A Fairly Decent But Annoying Read,"The part 3 of the Riverwold series. It's nowhere near as good as either of the first 2 books of the series were (To Your Scattered Bodies Go & The Fabulous Riverboat).One of the main faults of the book is that an excessively large number of chapters deal with science fiction writer Peter Jairus Frigate who by chance remarkably resembles the author Philip Jose Farmer.The main purpose of this character seems to be to serve as something of a mouthpice for Farmer to vent his views on humanity, the nature of people, religion and Riverworld....And all the subtly of a seal clubbing.This is worsened by the fact that every time the book really starts to get the reader involved it breaks to a chapter or 4 filled with the musings and incessant ramblings of PJF (you decide which) or filling in the backstory of Frigate WHICH GOES NO WHERE!I dread to think of what this book would have been like BEFORE it was edited."
2,A let down after the first two volumes,"The prose is remarkably bad -- remarkably because the first two volumes in this series, while not likely to win an award for style, were written in a solid, brisk and workmanlike way.This installment, produced about five years after the first two, reads like a first-draft. It is bloated with personal histories of even the most minor characters, pages of repetitious arguments and endless measurements of each and every object (come on, do we need to know that a fictious mountain is 9,144ft or simply that it's higher than our characters can climb?).Overall, Riverworld would have made a great trilogy. But one has the impression that the publisher, knowing that the first two books had developed such a following, decided not to whittle down Farmer's original 400,000-word manuscript for this book. That's a shame for readers, even if it meant that the publisher could sell more books."
4,"Well worth reading, but only for fans","The ""Riverworld: Including To Your Scattered Bodies Go & The Fabulous Riverboat"" series has fascinated me ever since the first book was published while I was in high school. I have read them all, more than once. ""The Dark Design (Riverworld Saga)"" does not reach the literary heights of the first book, but then, follow up books seldom do. As in any long-running, multi-book series by a modern author, the prose in this one needs a good copy editor. There are a number of useless scenes and meaningless dialogues. Still, for someone who loves River World and wants to spend as much time as possible exploring it's landscape, The Dark Design will provide the exhausting immersion they are looking for. The Dark Design is well worth reading, but only a true fan will have the patience for it."
3,Was great in the beginning then the end.......,This book was great in the beginning then it just lagged on in the end. I like the part where there was this girl they introduced. She was gay so it was neat but shocking. Then after that chapter he totally got rid of the character. It took me awhile to finish the rest of the book and it wasnt worth it. My favorite book is the first book in this series.
1,Going Steadily Downhill,"I just finished reading The Dark Design. What a chore. I kept hoping for something like the first book in the series, To Your Scattered Bodies Go, but no luck. It's like the author lost all control of the story. Several times I lost track of who the characters were and which story line they belonged to. The first book of the series was one of the best I'd ever read and I had such hope for the series. I really wanted to find out why the planet was created and humanity transplanted there, and ""who done it"". But, by the end of this book I'm not sure even the author knows and from the reviews I've read of the fourth book in the series I don't have much hope there either. I made it through the second book and the third (barely) but I think I'll stop there, thank you."
3,"overwritten, careless","severe and brutal editing would have greatly improved flow and quality. Frankly the Frigate character should have been left out of books 3 and 4- reducing page count, pretentiousness, and improving flow"
2,Down We Go,"Call me silly, but I think that the level of the story drops steadily from book one through this one. Now, after the Riverboat is built, dirigibles come into the picture (now why didn;t I think of that!?). Okay, Sam Clemens and his cohorts are hot on the heels of King John the dastardly. Are they going to get him? The enterprising dirigible pilot Jill Gulbirra (of the Clemens lot) finally reaches the mysterious tower at the center of the polar sea. I won;t spoil it for you by giving it away. Let me just tell you that it is ..ahem.. less than revealing. But the absolutely worst sin of this book are the endless parentheses dedicated to Peter Frigate's dreams and reminiscences which say absolutely nothing. At the start of the book, Farmer points out the autobiographical genesis of Frigate's character but he still is (at least so far) a very minor character that simply does not justify the soporific dream sequences."
2,"Great Concept, poor execution.","Great concept, but terrible execution. Pacing is off...dialogue is ok. Plot seems thin and overly drawn out for what is in actuality little action. This feels like a guy just going through the motions. The sections where he indulges in reverie about his childhood are agonizing...So much of this book could have been cut down. The parts where he should expand, draw it out, he rockets through. The opportunity to juxtapose historical figures is not utilized to anywhere near its full potential.Overall, if I hadn't invested so much time with these, I'd just stop. Kindof wish a solid writer would have taken his concept and gone with it. So many fun directions to take this world, but instead we get a meandering, meaningless, worse than middle of the road effort."
3,Too much ramblings!,"I really enjoyed the first book. The second book was okay. I thought with the return of Burton, this book will be much better. It just was not so. Burton and Clemens now are not the main characters. There are a multitude of other characters now that we follow up the River. And some of the characters are really interesting. However, the complaint I have about this book is its length. You could probably cut out about 1/3 of the writing and it would still be fine. It especially got annoying in the second half, when there was so much action involved in one chapter. The next chapter suddenly stops and rambles on about Frigate's life. I may or may not read the next book..."
1,The dumbest designers in the world,"I bought this product for my IPOD Nano because I wanted an arm band holder that featured cord management and didn't cost an arm-and-a-leg. So when I got it I went to put my IPOD in it and discovered that whoever had designed it must not actually own a nano because whoever did design it put the holes for the headphones in the wrong place. There are holes for the headphones both on top and bottom of the nano pocket, but in-order for it to work the nano has to be turned with the nano face facing in, making it impossible to actually operate the nano while it is installed. The unit is too tight to run the cord through the holes and then plug it in to the correct side. I thought about taking a knife to it to put the holes in the right spot, but ended up just using my old one. I should have returned it but it just wasn't expensive enough for the bother. If you want a good armband for your nano look elsewhere."
4,works fine...,"Works fine so far, but it's a bit tough to manuever the Mini in and out of the case [tight squeeze]. My arms aren't skinny by any means, but the armband is still a bit big and loosens up while running. Lastly, if you perspire, the material can get pretty damp."
2,"good, but a little shallow like the main character","This was my first Lorna Landvik book and I was mildly entertained. But, the only character that was fully developed was the main character. Maybe ignoring the other characters was the author's way of reinforcing the main character's self absorbsion and arrogance."
4,Retirement means do something different!,"Like Maeve Binchy's populace of Dublin, Lorna Landvik's characters are good people. It's very nice to read a book about people who do the right thing, address their faults and take what they learned from their own past into an evolved new chapter of their lives.If there's a handsome prince too, all the better!"
3,Somewhat disappointed,"I remember when I picked up Lorna Landvik's ""Patty Jane's House of curl"" on a whim some years ago. I thought it was great! So, when ""Your oasis on Flame Lake"" came out, I snapped it up right away. I liked that one a lot as well. Then came ""Tall Pine Polka"", and things changed for me. I didn't like it nearly as much as the two previuos ones, and lost interest about halfway through. I finished it, but not with much enthusiasm. I just finished reading ""Welcome to the Great Mysterious"" yesterday, and once again I was disappointed. Once again, I lost interest about halfway through. It seems Landvik has lost some of what made the two first books so great."
4,Landvik is getting back on track,"""Patty Jane's House of Curl"" is one of my favorite books and, when I first read it, I thought I had found one of the next great writers. I did enjoy ""Your Oasis on Flame Lake"" and, to a much lesser extent, ""The Tall Pine Polka,"" but it was obvious that Landvik's skill seemed to be going down hill.""Welcome to the Great Mysterious"" does have its problems. The biggest one being that the character development is shallow. More minor are the holes in the story (Ann and Riley go to Italy so Riley can teach, but he never DOES teach; Geneva's mother isn't motherly, but we never see why Geneva feels this way).All that being said, I did enjoy this book and it did bring me to tears. While it wasn't as fulfilling as ""Patty Jane's Houst of Curl,"" it was definitely worth the time it took to read it.If ""Mysterious"" is a sign of things to come, it looks like Landvik is back on track."
4,Very uplifting,"This was a sweet story of family love and close knit friendships. Lorna Landvik writes a story many of us can relate too. At first I wasn't sure how she was going to tie all the characters together, but she slowly develops the story never giving away the ending. I read it in two days and wished the epilogue was longer...."
5,Stay with Canon brand ink,Only canon brand ink will work effectively without causing damage to the print head of the Canon Pixma printer/scanner/copier/fax
5,"It's a necessity (extra black ink, that is)","Well, I'd like to say that I'm using my photo printer for photos only and I do, most of the time but, from time to time, when my laser printer is out of toner or because it just happens that the photo printer is closer and it's on and I feel too lazy to do the right thing, I print a few pages of ordinary text on ordinary paper and, invariably, I run out of black ink faster than I consume the other colors.So, getting some extra black ink is a necessity and this happens to be a pretty good deal. At this price, I see no reason to bother with cheap deals because, if you do, your prints quality is likely to suffer and your printer is likely to suffer."
1,Not Canon Ink,I purchased this product based on other reviews that said they received genuine Canon Ink. I was very disappointed when I received my shipment and found that I did not get Canon Ink. Because off brand ink produces photos with an unknown life I will be throwing these in the garbage.
3,"There's a lot in it, but...","I trust Time Out for background info (maybe I shouldn't?) but I've found that, particularly with this guide, they seem to like every listing they've put in (and there are a lot) without really differentiating between them. Not much help when you know you don't have time to explore everything..."
2,Blah,"i was really hoping this would be a great book, but i was severely disappointed. this was the only book i bought for Venice, and i wish i had saved my money. i ended up getting a DK eyewitness book and it was way better. the information didn't seem to be up to date, and we found better suggestions from our hotel."
3,Good Value,"Not very accurate, not easy to use, not very stylish but a good value non the less. If it falls on the floor and breaks your not out that much. It's much better than guessing."
3,The title is misleading,"The title of the book and its description here made me think the book would be relevant to all cognitive disabilities. However, the bulk of the book is about Down syndrome. The anecdotes are about people with Down syndrome and information about reproduction, etc. is specific to Down syndrome. Also, although the anecdotes kind of give you a warm fuzzy feeling, there is not a whole lot of practical information about teaching your child anything related to sexuality, dating, the birds and the bees, etc."
5,great for NiN fans,"the DVD starts off with how Industrial music started... it goes on on that for about 40min. then when it hits NiN it pretty much leaves out any Industrial band that was after them... I got this DVD because of NiN so I really enjoyed watching it but if you want to buy a DVD about Inustrial music and bands I dont thik this is for you. The DVD covers Pretty Hate M. all the way to ""The Slip"" It has awesome interviews and clips of nin Vids. No Trent though. I would say this is a great buy for hardcore NiN fans! :)"
3,Great but could have been better.,"As part of the saga remaster series, softworks is remastered by steve negus and is mostly a cd rom interactive. However the songs THE CALL and PERFECT STRANGER which are not on saga albums are here and playable in a cd player. The disc is cool but why not include songs like GOTTA LOVE IT or their version of SOLSBURY HILL released around the same time as THE CALL. So this is cool but could have been better. Dont miss other sage remasters. if it says 2002 or later its a remaster under the bands supervision."
5,Super,This bar is one of the best I've tasted. A mix of a snicker and a butterfinger with the addition of peanut butter that Reese is known for.
2,Overpriced,"I have no doubt that this is a good product. A power switch is a power switch. However I thought everyone should know that if you have a large scale computer store such as fry's anywhere nearby you they probably offer this for $2 to $3. I know that the Fry's in my neighborhood sells this exact same switch for $1.99. Simply don't pay this much for a power switch. Amazon has other switches and even power, reset, hdd led and power led combos for between 4 and 6 dollars."
5,Erudite,"This is the Oxford Book of Snobs, and displays the erudition that one has come to expect from that press. Utilizing quotations from a variety of sources (many literary, of the highest quality), it presents a sophisticated view of snobbery that transcends more simplistic sociological and anecdotal books."
4,Easy like a Sunday morning...,"ATTN: peopleI usually don't give rave reviews and announce my best/worst dress list; but since I'm the first to give comments on this album, I say, oh! what the heck...Anyways, this CD is one of the best Lounge/Chillout albums on my collection. This one's a ""must have to bring with"" in my car/cd changer when I'm heading work to-and-fro, starting to go out barhoppin' or coming home tipsy (suggestion to play: track#10-Sunday's Child) from barhoppin'. The songs and it's progression from one track to another is flawless. From a groovy start 'Milano Bossa' to my personal fave-'Promise'(Cassioppe), the oh-so loungey 'Honey' ('luv! Tosca) and the very kewl-witty track 'Your Revolution'. I very easily get bored and extremely hard to subjugate, but this CD will continuously be scratchin my player... well, at least until I get bored again...äleczänder..."
3,"Good, but not a nail-biter...","The book is certainly well written and could form the authoritative account of the ""Flying Enterprise"", but I found myself stalling in some of the detail. The storm action really ends after the first 100 pages and the attempted towing of the wreck takes up the remainder of the book. It's a well-written book, I learned a lot about the shipping industry, and the making of a hero, but this isn't an edge-of-the-seat page turner, if you are looking for that."
1,Needlessly verbose with too much hero-worshipping,"I was massively disappointed by this book. What transpired on the Flying Enterprise in the early 50s was an extremely exciting story unto itself. If the author had simply relayed the day by day historical record of what had happened on board the ship prior to sinking, I would have been satisfied. Instead we are presented with chapters upon chapters about the Captain's good character which frankly could have been summarized in about two paragraphs. Something tells me that Kurt Carlson himself would have been embarrassed by yet another ""ass-kissing"" tribute. I would have liked to have seen more interviews or accounts from other crew members or passengers incorporated within the book. For a non-fiction story about the sea which is exciting but focuses on the historical record, I would strongly recommend ""A Voyage for Madmen""."
3,Could have been 100 pages shorter,The story of the Flying Enterprise is great in itself. I found myself bored reading about the authors experiences & narration on how the story affected him. It was very redundant.Pick this book up & skip the authors personal comments & enjoy the tremedous story!
5,Mozart: His Time Under Heaven,"Mozart's divinely inspired genius radiates harmonic bliss in these interpretations of his compositions. Dixit Dominus, the Word of God, beckons the listener to attend to the exquisite musical voices of St. John's College Choir, the Wren Orchestra (Guest conducting), Schola Cantorum of Oxford, and the St. Martin-in-the-Fields Orchestra (Marriner conducting). Listening to Laudate Dominum is a lovely way to celebrate Mozart any year, but particularly, in 2006!"
2,Not Too Much New Here,I still don't understand what the Goebbels Experiment was. I saw a lot of the speeches of the Nazi propaganda chief.
5,Cleverness is not the same as wisdom,"It's funny that it has taken this long for someone to do a documentary on Joesph Goebbels. He is an excellent subject for this treatment. He operated in that most public of political operations-propaganda-and he was next to Hitler the prime orater of the Third Reich. Also, he left a rather detailed diary from the 1920's to his death in 1945. The makers of the film wisely let goebbels speak for himself,with an actor reading from the diary through the film. It presents a man who was certainly very clever and ingenious-but to what appaling ends! If ever there was a lesson needed on the difference between even the most brilliant cleverness and wisdom, the life of Joesph Goebbels is a prime example. And the ending, showing footage of Goebbels burned and chared corpse,is the final and inevidable comment. How horroible and completely unneccessary it all was."
1,"A self-congratulatory ""diary"" of yet another Nazi thug","Maybe a Nazi in his eighties, pining for the good old days of the ""Thousand Year"" Reich might find this meaningful. It reveals nothing about this wannabe except his constant self-congratulation (""My speech went very well."") in almost every entry. His low-class Rhenish accent (Deitsch for Deutsch), humble origins and the fact that he had no friends and was disliked say it all. This well-edited video and good clips really don't give any insight into the Nazi obsession with communism, Jews or snuffing out democracy. Watch Verdict at Auschwitz instead - amazingly revealing and detailed - and bypass this crap. Branagh, why did you waste your time on this?"
4,TRACK LISTING for the CD:,1. Orphan's Theme2. Pretend Face3. The Waiting4. Fantasy5. Mystery River6. Where I Belong7. Blue Car8. 9119. Black Moon10. Phrenophobia11. Upside Down
4,after shower,I bought this after using Vaseline's Aloe gel.I absolutley love the smell for after a morning shower.I bought this for only 3 dollars at target! Its worth it
3,Rip off,"Umm.. can we say AMERIE rip off. This girl sounds like amerie, her MUSIC style sounds like amerie. Amerie came out before this girl, so it's obvious she's ripping off amerie. I mean seriously, when i listen to this album, i think amerie is the one singing. This album isn't original, this is a rip off. There are only two good songs on the album, and ya know what they sound like amerie. lol. If you like TEEDRA, YOU'LL love amerie."
1,Absolutely Boring :(,I am so sorry I tried and tried listening to this cd over and over again...her voice isn't anything special...her songs are boring...I think the only time I played this was the first day I put it in my car...now it's under my bed near the garabage can with spider webs around it...*Maybe I should vacuum there* but that is all :( Huge Dissappointment
4,have you ever heard an angel sing?,"Teedra Moses is the best singer to come along in a good while. Her voice has a special quality that you cannott quite put your finger on; it's soothing,uplifting,and so sweet that you can taste the sugar on your tongue.Teedra is not only a fantastic singer;her songwriting skills show us how multitalented she is. This is a cd that you can play from beginning to end without having to skip over any of the songs because they are all very good.""Rescue me"" is my favorite because of it's ""jazzy"" feel. This young lady will be around for a long time. I look forward to her next cd."
4,Who is Teedra Moses? You betta ask somebody.,"I honestly didn't know who Teedra Moses was until i heard her song ""Take Me"" and her rendition of Musiq's ""Who Knows"" on the show ""Noah's Arc"". She is truly a talent to be reckoned with. Not only is she beautiful and has a beautiful voice but check the song credits out and see who wrote them. I don't know who her promoter is but he needs to be fired. This is a talent that the world needs to hear. I love the album almost straight through. Overall, the album is a worth having."
4,Didn't get the recognition she deserves,"this cd is a good listen the entire way through. The cut with Raphael Sadiq is definitely my fav. i really don't understand why this cd and this artist didn't get more attention, its much better than what some other R&B female singers have been putting out lately."
5,Teedra Moses,"Definitely Teedra Moses is an artist that has unfortunately been overlooked. Her CD Complex Simplicity is a great listen from start to finish with no need to skip any tracks. Anyone looking for above average R & B with stellar production, trust me this is the CD you are looking for"
5,Must add to your collection!,"Ok, I'm not a big R&B; fan, I'd rather listen to rap. BUT, one of my friends turned me on to this CD and whenever I am in the mood to listen to R&B;, THIS IS IT!She speaks on a variety of topics that I'm sure you will be able to relate to or at the very least understand. Great vocalist.You rarely find a cd that you can play from start to end without skipping wack tracks. With this cd, I can play every song, hell, I even go back and play some of them again.I love this cd and wish that she would come out with more!"
5,Simply AMAZING!,"This album was so overlooked its unbelievable and sad. Its just as sad as Faith Evans 3rd album that was overlooked as well. This woman has amazing talent with a voice and looks to match. All the songs on here are certified gold and have a great sound, but these are the hand picked fav's...1) Be your girl (first single)2) You'll never find ft.Jadakiss (second single)3) You better tell her (3rd single,also featured on t-moble caller tunes)4)Caution5)Complex Simplicity6)For a lifetime7)Caught up8)My last dayTeedra Moses is worth supporting,hopefully she will make a housefold name for herself.Check out this album, you will not be dissapointed."
5,Best R&B Cd of 2004 & most Under rated,"If you don't have this album you definitely need to add it to your collection. I generally dont write reviews about cd's, but I couldnt let Teedra slip by without giving her props. I have a 6 disc changer in my car and Complex Simplicity is always in the rotation! This is an excellent collection of sultry r&b tracks. She has a great mix of upbeat and mellow tempo relationship songs that we all can relate to. This is a winner from beginning to end, with the exception of 1 or 2 songs. The only problem I have with this masterpeice is that her label's promotions team didnt push her the way they should have. This should be multi-platinum album by now. Its definitely the best r&b cd of the year!"
4,I good CD,"I first saw teedra moses on BET, then I heard her whole album and to my surprise it was really good. I love her voice, she can actually sing, so I am really enjoying this cd, I love number 1, 4, and 5."
5,Who Woulda Thought...,"Someone signed to Lil Jon's Label would come out with quality Music. This CD is not your ASHANTI or Ciara. Even though she does not have an A+ singing voice(maybe A-). Teedra's album is something that R&B; lovers will really enjoy. Standouts include:1. You'll Never Find (A Better Woman)-One of the singles2. No More Tears-""Sippin, Puffin, passing"" how do you sing this and made it soulful3. Rescue Me-Nice little diddy4. Take Me-Raphael Does it Again5. You Better Tell Her-This song is hilarious6. I Think of You (Shirley's Song)-A tribute to her motherYou will not regret getting this album. Lyrics, production, and beats are all on point. You wont find yourself pressing the SKIP button"
4,a very good debut . but why no airplay?,i think that teedra's vocals and production are top knotch to say the least i just think it really bad that she isnt getting the promotional support she deserves but i know its hard to get mtv and bet to rotate and srtist who is on an idependant label bottom line if she was on j records she would be platinum plus already
5,A Breath of Fresh Air,"This is the first review I've ever written but this cd has compelled me to. I'm an avid lover of ""GOOD"" music, to the likes of A. Keys, Badu, Musiq, Usher, Charelle, Cameo, Prince, and so many others, and Teedra is among those artists in my book. I think she deserves all the success of a Beyonce and more. I picked it up over the weekend on a wimb and was so truly surprised by the quality, originality (influences can be heard), and ""you gotta feel me"" factor of EVERY track, BIG UPS to Pauli Pol, producer, for giving us what we want to hear. For all those who hate getting ripped off by empty cd's sadly over-marketed, BUY this one and ""Breath Easy"" from what Teedra has brought to the body of music and what you've given in return through you're support $$$, a win win NO DOUBT!!"
3,Enjoyable read that keeps you intrigued,"Perhaps it's not the best way of endorsing a book seller, but I actually borrowed this novel from my local library and found I couldn't put it down. Though the characters and setting aren't anything extraordinary or enthralling, I actually found the story to be very well written in that it really kept me intrigued to learn the answer to Kirtsten's mystery. The characters and their relationships were subtly written yet still had complexity about them. I found myself empathizing with both the Kirsten and Clive characters and really felt Kirsten's frustration in particular, and how tormenting it must be to lose one's memory and feel you're living a life that doesn't belong to you. Not what I'd call an oustanding book but well written and a truly enjoyable read. I'd recommend it for a rainy day."
3,Organized crime boss,"It was okay....but a little self indulgent.Defintately written with a onesided view...but entertaining and at times interesting.Other ""boss"" books are better written but I would probably still recommend it to organized crime readers"
4,really enjoyed it,"Good book to read if you're a mafia story fan. The beginning is great. It only gets a little boring towards the end, but I guess since he wasn't as active in his older years, there's not much to say. Good book though."
4,a man of honor,"This was a very good read as I enjoyed the information that this book made available.Sincerely,Kathy Klein"
2,A little dull at times and not a complete tell all,"The book was a decent read but I found Bonanno to be quit repeatative at times. He goes on and on about the Sicilian way of life, and how American's more or less don't understand it. Furthermore he tiptoes around all violence that comes with being in the ""Family"" as he so eloquently puts it. I found it to be a little dry, not so ""tell all"", and in the end I find Mr. Bonanno using his Sicilian background and way of life as justification for being in organized crime. Although he himself would never admit that the ""Family"" he was apart of was organized crime, the crux of the book. He calls himself a ""Man of Honor"" yet he admitly cheats on his wife and lived a life ingrossed in organized crime, hypocritical to say the least."
4,Air purifier,"This purifier (Austin Healthmate Jr.) seems to be a very good purchase for the money. Although it is not cheap, we are using it in a loft and it seems to be doing a great job with the air not only in the loft but also in the living room which is below the open-air loft."
2,A thorough discussion of the politics of the times.,"I didn't enjoy the endless discusions of the politics of the times. The book is really 300 pages long with 100 pages of sources. The passion of war was lost in the endless quotes and opinions of politicians and officers during each event. For example, I still don't know how the battle of New Orleans was faught. Who suffered? Who was outflanked? A few americans dead and a lot of british. The vote in congress was 13 to whatever and the bill didn't pass. The book is for serious scholars who can appreciate the hard work and detail the author has included and not for the casual history buff interested in the human condition."
2,A Dry Read,"Another reason not to buy books that are neither Pulitzer winners nor best sellers on-line. While this book may appeal to a true academic.....the prose does not stack up against Chernow, Catton, Shirer or Foote. Had I been able to physically examine the book before buying, I wouldn't have bought."
4,America's First Defeat,"Donald Hickey provides a reasonably detailed study of the war of 1812, that is well written and concise. The books only real failing is a loss of objectivity in the closing chapters.The war of 1812 is interesting as an early example of American imperialism (It's greedy eyes cast on acquiring Canada) and of the fledgling nation's first defeat. And defeat it is: Despite the loss of the Battle of New Orleans for the British (Fought after the treaty of Ghent was signed, effectively nullifying its political value) the USA pretty much walked away with no concessions whatsoever; Its ""Success"" at the negotiating table was the same as that. Ie: It was lucky to walk away with the status quo re-established and nothing of value taken away from her.There are probably better single volumes treatments available, but if there are I have yet to read them. Recommended."
4,The War of 1812 the pride of patriots,"Not since 1776, has the United States and Britian fought. But in the year of 18 and 12 this on going battle was fought once again and once and for all. This books tracks America demanding it's rights to neutrality , to the bitter sweet cries of battle for a second independance. The Author of this book has pulled a forgetton lore from the bowels of history , and recreated it for todays age. So that we may never forget the War of 1812. I recommend this books for any student , any one with an inquiring mind , but most of all I recommend it for the American Patriot."
5,Superb Locomotive Illustrations,"What an incredibly impressive book this is! From the moment you open it, you are struck at the beautiful, detailed photographs of majestic locomotives. This book illustrates locomotives at Britain's major workshops which came into the possession of British Railways in 1948. In the workshops, outside the sheds and on the mainline after overhaul, the photos are absolutely superb. The variety of locomotives is equally impressive. It's fun to see the engines in various states of dis-assembly, painting and awaiting attention. Each workshop is a chapter, and is accompanied by a page to a page and a half of text explaining the history of the workshop. Most of the photos are from the 1950's and 60's. Some were taken during open houses to the shops and sheds. If you have an interest in British locomotives and where and how they were overhauled, you really should get this book!"
3,A Step in the Right Direction,"Even though I didn't agree with everything that Eng had to say, I found the book very helpful in aiding me to find my own path as an Asian American woman. While reading the book, I expected and was looking forward to Eng giving me detailed advice about how to run my life! What really caught me off guard was her message that there is no one path and that we should pave our own!"
2,Better Left Unsaid,"If I were a Chinese American woman I would be grossly insulted. However, since I a lower middle class white woman, I was merely insulted. By the fourth chapter I was so tired of reading about her ""victimization."" If she worked as hard as the many Chinese Americans I have met in this city, she might have a point. However, she came off as another self-serving yuppy who interviewed other self-serving yuppies who spent their collective lives trying to be tried so hard ""not to be viewed as secretaries"" (women who actually work and who haven't been given her economic opportunities). Ms. Eng, please suffer through a real job or at least interview people who do before writing another book."
4,A Great Guide for Asian American women,"I really enjoyed reading this book because the author used many different interviews to make a point. She raised my issues that i am dealing with in my life as an Asian American female. The reason that this book went over really well for me is because of the ""lessons"". I liked how she offered solutions to problems."
5,"great product, fast delivery","We bought two of these, they offer plenty of room for my boxer (55 lb) and australian shepherd. Best part was the shipping was extremely fast (they arrived two days after purchased). Easy to set up and fold down (with a latch so they stay folded for travel). A little on the heavy side, it was challenging for me to move it around without help, but very sturdy. Will last a long time."
4,an invaluable companion for the long distance walker !,Early last year my friend and i attempted to cycle along the path of the Southern Upland Way by using the guide by Roger Smith (despite advice by the author that it was not a cycle path ).Needless to say we failed although this was due to the Scottish weather and not being prepared .This short venture on to the trail had us amazed at the countryside and scenery although there were more clouds pouring rain .We decide to come back later on that year and this time we would walk and be better prepared .On our weekends we went to the local hill s and exercised and practised our mapreading skills just in case we needed to put them to good use .When we complete d the walk in August we had the guide and maps to thank as it kept us on the correct path right to the end .We now have a map each as a reminder of our wonderful walk over 212 miles of the most beautiful Scottish countryside . Worth it`s weight in gold !!!
5,Great instrument,"My 3.5 year old loves it.Drum set sounds great, easy to assemble. You'll be puzzled if you order and see the small box it comes in but it's all there and the size is just perfect for a 4-7 year old. Great for the prize."
4,what I think of Puzzlemaster as a game,"The puzzles were not very original. Rather Common. Colors, however, were great. Not very good subject matter. Really like ability to change degree of difficulty. Too many similiar puzzles."
3,Could be better,"I really enjoy the Puzzle Master series, but was disappointed in this version. I thought I would receive a new set of puzzles, but instead received a slightly expanded version of Puzzle Master 4 which I already had."
5,mother loved it!,"perfect gift for my mother. loves puzzles but hated all the space they took up. no worry with them being on the computer! she really enjoyed the ability of changing the difficulty, shape of pieces, and most of all that you can quit and pick right up where you left off on another day. seller was excellent and extremely prompt."
4,Very Good Quality But high ink consume,"The quality of this printer it's very good, it prints very reality photos, as if they were printed on a professional laboratory. It really surprised me. The only problem it that the ink goes fast in the best quality mode so you'll need to replace them very often."
2,it works,This is an excellent printer when it works. I have had four of them so far. #1 was DOA. #2 worked for a while. #3 was DOA. #4 is doing a good job.
4,HP PhotoSmart 7450 Inkjet Printer,"I had always been told that HP printers were the best inkjet units on the market and after my experience with this PhotoSmart 7450 I am now a true believer. There is simply no comparison between this printer and the Canons, Epson, and Lexmark units I had previously owned. This thing spits out color prints 5 or 6 times faster and with at least twice the print quality of any of my former units. The only fault I can find with it involves the cost of the ink cartridges. I really like the memory card reader built in the front of the printer also. I have not had a chance to print any photos with it yet, but with the quality of the regular prints it produces they should be impressive. As long as you can afford to feed its cartridge habit, I would not hesitate to recommend this printer to anyone!"
5,a must have printer two tumbs up all the way,since i have bought this printer i have had no problems.instaling it was a breeeze the quality of the prints are excellent even when it is set at its lowest quality i dont no why other person are complaining about the ink life i have no problem at all and i have printed so many documents and have not change the ink. if i could have given this printer 100 stars i would have. a must have printer
2,Paper jams,"I use this printer for a few days, and the main problem with it (and probably with many HP printers) is demands for a good quality paper.If you put cheap 80gm paper in it it will jam each second page (too light paper - it pick up 5-6 pages at a time) :(If you put cheap photo paper it will not feed it (too heavy paper - it doen't bend properly in the feed unit :(The old cheap Lexmark Z25 work with this paper without any problem.So buying this printer you bound yourself to buying expensive paper (HP of course :) expensive cartriges etc...Another problem is drivers. There is so many of stuff installed and hangs in memory. Even if you choose minimal installation, which should be a drivers only, you got HP Image Zone and some other software installed. Just to say - installation themself (copying/installing files) takes ~15 min on P4 2.5G.Otherwise it is fine - printing quality is good and photos are perfect."
1,Another awful HP printer,"I have went through a frustrating run of HP printers, and this model will be the final one I will ever buy. I used to enjoy the dependability of an HP printer, but lately every one I have purchased has malfunctioned in some way shortly if not right out of the box.This printer offers a decent amount of function for the price, however, it repeatedly wasted at least two sheets of paper with noise every time I turned my computer on...a problem I have had with several HP printers. After this, it began to kick out paper at random and print starting in the middle of the page. If this printer actually operated as advertised, it would be a nice deal for the money. As it, I would recommend going with an Epson if at all possible. I will do so in the future."
2,"very easy to use,,,makes good pictures,,printing is lousy","my 7450 makes good pictures,,,,,,,,, with out any problem,software is outstanding,, my problem is in the printing mode, the print starts out on the left side of the paper, right,,then as you get to the center of the paper ,, it gets higher, from the center it drops down, in other words it has a curve from left to right,, hp sent me a new on today, it does the same thing[...]"
2,Open channel hydraulics,This is not a book for novices of fluid mechanics. The example problems are very vague on the applications of the theorems introduced in the book. I found this to be more of a reference handbook for experienced individuals.
5,State of art,"Words are meaningless to Professor Dr. Ven Te Chow, as he is the best by far, in his field of knowledge. This book is highly recommended. truly, the very first to grab."
2,its ok,"this book is an ok read and is quite helpful when trying to get your head round the vast field that is forensic science but you wouldnt want to read it more than once.i recommend crime scene to court, the principles of forensic science which is much more interesting"
