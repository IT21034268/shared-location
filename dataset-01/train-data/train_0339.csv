2,A bit thick,"This book is, good, on the whole, but it's not very engaging. In order to translate the sentences into understandable english, you have to constantly flip back and forth to the notes in the front or many words will make no sense to you. get a different version, I pray you."
3,These guys make the Hell's Angels look respectable,"Fascinating book. Pre-Christian gang of thugs rapes, robs, pillages, murders, and kidnaps each other's wives. These guys make the Hell's Angels look like charter members of the National Organization for Women.These guys must be Bill Clinton's role models."
1,arthur,this book was a waste of timedo not read this its too long and is boring. Nothing goes on in it and the charecters are stupid. this book is not worth your time. If I was you I would buy GTA Vice City .
5,Dial this....,"I first heard these guys on a bouldering video called Inertia. I was blown away. I didn't know who sung MacFly at the time... so I went and checked out every band that was in the Video til I found Dial 7. Man, these guys rock. What a find!"
5,"""Never Enough Time"" is an incredible CD everyone should get","If you are looking for something a little different then buy this CD.You will not be disapointed. The songs are widely diverse ranging from smooth reggae beats to harder pseudo punk to phunk. This is a band that is going to explode very soon. Check out the songs ""Mac FLY"" and ""SJL"" especially. They are sort of a combination of 311 mixed with Pharcyde and Lenny Kravitz if you can imagine that. The songs are incredibly catchy. I can't stress it enough. It is a great change of pace from all the stuff out there right now. This album is for real."
5,"Get out of the old, into the new","Dial 7 is like putting 311,Bob Marley,Incubus, Sublime, and Bone Thugs n Harmony in the same room, pressing record and saying, ""All right guys, make an album."" This compilation is incredible!!! This band plays very tight, and their different influences definetly shine through on NEVER ENOUGH TIME. No matter what mood your in, Dial 7 will have a song for it. It's groups like them that make you wonder why people actually go out and buy Puff Daddy and Matchbox20. It's time for the mainstreamers to move over and let Dial 7 take the wheel."
5,LEADERS IN THE NEW MUSIC REVOLUTION,"Dial 7 is one of the coolest bands I've had the pleasure of meeting and listening to. Their music knows no ethnic or social barriers. If you want to jump on board the music revolution, buy this album today, it doesn't matter if you've never heard of them before, take my word for it: You'll be emensly satisfied!"
2,"Once you wash them, you have to iron them!!!","I was in love with my new sheet set!! The color was amazing and it felt like sateen. The problem came when I wash them for the first time. After they dry up, they were so wrinkle that I had to iron them. I never had to iron sheets in my hole life!"
4,"""Out From Nassau""","I loved ""Out From Nassau""! Fia Scheyer is a wonderful writer and did a marvelous job of creating and developing her characters. Having some knowledge of the Bahamas and its people I find the story of the out-islanders very authentic, as is the plot and the various relationships. I could hardly put it down! It is very readable. It is indeed a pleasure to find such a fine book.Rufus Broadaway"
4,Out From Nassau,"Fia Scheyer's book, ""Out From Nassau"", really captures the feel, sounds and smells of the Bahamas. Written with unusual sensitivity for the indigenous population, the book drives home the importance of human relationships. Ms. Scheyer's knowledge of the local seas as well as the local people, comes through on literally every page. And her weaving of this tale makes it amply clear what human values should be as Hannah makes her tough life choices. Good book!"
2,"Wake up, Hollywood!","This is a great story, so why won't Hollywood put it out on DVD in English?The major actors, Caine and Brosnan, are perfect for the parts, but I'm gettingtired of watching it on an old VHS. Please light a fire under Hollywood toput the DVD out again in English, Region 1."
4,A great movie,"The Fourth Protocol is as suspenseful from the book it was adapted from. In some ways it is better since the book does spend 100 pages going off on a tangent that the movie condenses into a 10 minute introduction. John Preston (Michael Caine) is an MI5 agent who happens upon a plot to detonate a nuclear bomb in the United Kingdom and must convince his superiors of the threat. Against him is Vladimir Petrofsky (Pierce Brosnan) who is deadly and ruthless as the Soviet agent sent to carry out this act. It's a race against time to see if Preston can put all the pieces together and stop Petrofsky. The movie adaptation has a higher body count than the book and throws in a bit of sex but is otherwise a faithful adaptation. The biggest complaint that could be made is that the movie has fallen into obscurity which is a shame considering the stars and the story. If you can find it, it's highly recommended."
3,Well Done but Plot Recycling,"This is a very well done and enjoyable Cold War thriller. The plot is clever and suspenseful, the acting, featuring the outstanding Michael Caine and an excellent supporting cast, is first-rate, and the direction is solid. The defect is that the plot is partly a retread of Forsyth's The Day of the Jackal. Forsyth's books tended to make very good movies. The Day of the Jackal, starring Edward Fox and directed by Fred Zinneman, is excellent and his book, The Dogs of War, was also made into an excellent thriller. Anyone who has seen or read The Day of the Jackal, will quickly recognize Forsyth's self-plagiarism. An amusing feature of this movie is that the Soviets, with the exception of Pierce Brosnan, are played by American actors."
3,A Slow Afternoon Favorite,"This is just an interesting movie to kill a couple of hours with.Without saying a lot the use of various actors as various nationalities is interesting.Pierce Brosnan is good and Sir Michael is here,to me,Harry Palmer a little further down the road."
1,I AGREE!!!,"I agree 100% with Raven. This is a taut suspenseful thriller, one of the best of it's genre. To not put this out on high-quality DVD in English or Blu-Ray is ridiculous. What Hollywood idiot makes these decisions???"
1,You will root for the bomb to explode!!!,"THE FOURTH PROTOCOL (1987)Directed by John Mackenzie. Script byFrederick Forsyth and Michael Caine. Based on the novel by FrederickForsyth. Score by Lalo Schifrin.Starring Michael Caine, Ian Richardson, Joanna Cassidy, Ned Beatty,Julian Glover, Michael Gough and Pierce Brosnan.The head of the KGB plots to detonate a nuclear device near anAmerican air base in Britain thus giving strength to the Nuclear freezemovement and the breaking up of NATO.Same plot as OCTOPUSSY but extraordinarly dreary and lacking insuspense. Most of the cast is wasted and Brosnan is somnambulic.Somehow in spite of the Cold War plot, the film seems divorced fromreality. As goofy as it is at times, the aforementioned Bond film hasa more convincing versimiltude. Someone had the dumb idea of havingall of the Russians speak with midwestern American accents.Not hideous. Not worth watching either."
4,too hot for me,"This is a very large heavy duty coffee pot warmer, not a mug warmer. It would have worked for me except there is only one setting and that is scalding hot. Too hot for me to drink anything I keep warm with it. It is also 100 watts ."
5,BUNN warmer cool look great function,"Recently members of our family have had to start drinking decaf, much to the dismay of the remaining heart healthy of us, that need our daily fix. The warmer has solved the problem, it fills in with a second carafe to hold both brews in the AM, and it looks good doing it on 100w of electricity."
2,Not as good,The case gets hot. A Bunn flat-sided pot does not sit solidly on the burner. I had one in plastic that I like better and it cost less but couldn't find it.
5,GREAT Product!,"I got this coffee warmer for my coffee mugs, due to my slow drinking of coffee while I get sidetracked on the computer.I figured it was probably more intended for coffee pots, but it defiantly works great with all sizes of coffee mugs.It keeps my coffee at the perfect temperature, where it's hot enough to have to sip it, but not burning hot where I burn my tongue.The shipping was awesome too, I got the cheapest shipping and it was here within 4 days and it also came in the morning right before I made my coffee, so I got to test it out! :)All reviews on other coffee warmers, more specifically for coffee mugs, were all negative saying it didn't get the drink hot enough. That's why I had chose this product instead and I am very satisfied!No more running to the microwave ever half an hour!"
4,Super color and actual drama,"What a nice surprise. This movie actually had real drama, as opposed to the trite fare currently produced by special technological feats. It produces no weeping but it might. The setting, knowing our current affairs in North Africa, is at best skewed and distorted. The color in the film though is extraordinary and the scenes impress."
4,Fabulous early movie,"This is one of the first coloured movies picturing a romantic story in the desert. The story is passionate, the images beautiful, and definitely worth seeing."
5,BEAUTIFUL,"This picture is the first movie entirely in color, and is beatiful. The story is simple: a monk in conflict with his faith meets a lovely lady who confuses him more. The subject is touched with tact and in a delicate way. Very recomandable. Timeless."
4,Wavishing! Womantic! Wisible!,"A Technicolor fever dream of a movie, GARDEN OF ALLAH is a guilty pleasure par excellence. Any dramatic tension that depends on the burning passion of Boyer and Dietrich is doomed from the start; two more self-absorbed performers never graced the camera. But, in parallel universes of suffering, they pout and posture and preen so gracefully, all is quickly forgiven. Joseph Schildkraut and Tilly Losch bring a touch of Mittle Europe to the Exotic East, and David O. Selznick's over-the-top physical production is as hyperbolic as the story and stars. Quentin Crisp said that in his youth, most movies were made for melancholy middle-aged women. This picture is what he meant. Open a box of chocolates, and wallow."
2,Very hard to watch.,"This movie absolutely made no sense. It skipped around from scene to scene, and even though they were related it seemed like 2 different movies. The director was an ex music video director, so of course it seemed like a 80 minute bad 80's music video.The concept of the Richard Nixon mask killer was great, but of course the movie didn't deliver at all in any way, shape or form."
1,Inexplicable,"The box says, ""They were young and in love, he was crazy, she was dead."" Not only does that no make any sense, it has nothing to do with this incredibly bad movie. A man in a Nixon mask (credited as ""Ronald Reagan"" at the end) kills people. Two brothers in an ugly house fumble around; one is supposed to be retarded, one is supposed to be crazy. College kids keep wandering into the house for various reasons, and they all get killed. When a beer-guzzling jock runs over the Nixon-killer with his car, his girlfriend tells him, ""You must have a low IQ!"" It barely makes sense, it's supposed to be funny, but can only manage to be weird and boring. All of the actors are strange looking, and the director made music videos. The only upside is that the original score of punk/surf/psych instrumentals is actually really excellent."
5,Top Notch,"If you like FGTH than this is the one you MUST buy ! All (well almost) the original mixes from frankie on two cd's...And if you know Frankie you will know that all the mixes are something special, they'll amaze you everytime !Conclusion: For every (casual) fan a must have.Enjoy ..."
4,A win-win book that will change your life!,Our entire company was required to read this book as it offers solid basic information on how to win customers and keep them for life. This book will affect you on a personal level. A must for any sales person.
4,Salon Professionals Rave,"Young stylist who come to work in our salon always comment on the number of clients that I have had of many years. I always tell them to read ""HOW TO WIN CUSTOMERS & KEEP THEM FOR LIFE"". I first read this book many years ago and I can honestly say that it taught me about quality customer service. It is now a part of our in house training program for new employees."
3,So-so erotica anthology,"I have always been intrigued with the topic of fetishes. As a writer who's researching said topic, I want to get my hands on the most literary and erotic fetish books out there. I thought I'd found it in Best Fetish Erotica, but, unfortunately, this book leaves a lot to be desired.Most of the fetishes in various stories are rather amusing, but the erotic part is nowhere to be found. However, there are some well-written tales of lustful fetishes, like ""Love Me Tender,"" ""The Naked City,"" and ""Office Hours.""The overall book is a disappointment though. I shall continue my quest to find intelligent erotic anthologies that stick to the subject in hand."
1,Uphill battle that I lost,"I thought the concept of this novel was interesting, which was why I bought it and took it home. I should have left it at the bookstore. While I don't mind the occasional Manly-man main character and his doormat token female story, it's got to be a well told and well written story with characters that are somewhat engaging. Barring good characters, the universe and the people who populate it have to be exceptional. Again, that didn't happen in this book. I felt like this books was a poor rip off of a pulpy detective novel with none of the intrigue. The alien races all blended into one another to the point I couldn't keep lizards, chipmunks, and bulldogs straight. Evil coral like the brain slugs from Futurama is an out there concept, but write it so it doesn't put me to sleep. Needless to say, I will not be seeking out and reading any of the sequels to this book."
2,Disappointing,"This book is fart below Zahn's usuall standards. Nothing exciting happens. Even the few surprises are hinted at transparently far before they happen and are disappointing. I had several ""Is that all?"" moments while reading this book.Don't buy it."
2,Meh. Stumbles along.,"I found this book based on the SCI FI ESSENTIAL BOOK tag, as well as having read the Heir To The Empire trilogy numerous times.Alas, I found this book to be plodding, inconsistent, and just plain boring. It attempts to be a sort of futuristic Raymond Chandler-Noir story. I think it failed at this.I admit that I have not read much of his non-Star Wars material; maybe I had to lofty expectations for Zahn. Whichever, I can still fall back and appreciate that man purely on his past work."
4,good reading,Interesting start to the series. I am looking forward to the continuing series and further character development. I am happy that the first book is now available on kindle.
3,finished but just ok,Average work from a great writer. Pace was not fast. Really should read earlier books in the series first. But not bad and has interesting aliens and premise.
3,Average train book,"We read this at a bookstore. I thought it was o.k., but way overpriced at $16. My 4-year-old has been begging me to buy it ever since, though. It has a nice ending, and if it were closer to $7, I would buy it."
3,God Scent,IU like this scent but it didnt come with the sprayer on top...I wanted the oldschool feeling but I think maybe the mens fragrence doesnt include it. Although that was never told to me.
5,Very Nice Smell,I brought this item because I smell it in a store one day but i didnt purchase. So I bought the cologne a couple months later and it was way better that time. Once you spray it and it come in contact with you skin the smell changes and smells even better. Very light long lasting cologne and I recommend this to all my cologne junkies. THIS IS A MUST HAVE PEOPLE. And you cant beat the price. Great gift also.
5,Great men's fragrance at a great price!,Complex and sophisticated fragrance - not your usual man's cologne yet not feminine. Does last a long time and the bass note is pleasant in the afternoon. Great price at Amazon.
5,"If you enjoy soapy scents, look no further","In terms of quality, Prada Amber is up there with the very best. Longevity and projection are excellent. As mentioned, this fragrance is quite ""soapy"". But think of very *expensive* soap. I imagine the soapiness has a lot to do with why so many people describe it as very ""clean"" smelling.An hour or so in, Prada Amber takes on a slightly powdery dimension, which very nicely counterbalances the soapy aspect. The whole fragrance really mellows out at that point into one of the smoothest scents you'll find. I should also note that some find it borderline unisex, but I personally couldn't see a woman pulling this one off.All in all, Prada Amber is very unique. I've smelled 100's of fragrances, and this one definitely stands out. If you're looking for a long-lasting, very high class and quality soapy scent that can go with everything from your work clothes to your best suit, check out Prada Amber Pour Homme."
1,pump spray top no good,"I order this product, which smell great, however because it didnt come as a seal top, it wasted in my over night bag, which was because of the spray pump that you have to attach. now Im out of prada and my money. wow!!!!!"
1,FAKE BEWARE,This is clearly a fake. Liquid is clear when it shold have a light blue color to it. The word PRADA is the wrong size on the bottle and worst of all it doesn't smell anything like it should. I thought being sold by Amazon it would be okay. How wrong I was.
5,Classy and long lasting.,"I cannot tell me how many times women have asked me what I am wearing when I used Prada for Men. Honestly, I get embarassed when a beautiful woman asked me. The funny thing is my wife isn't crazy about it. It is always strangers."
2,The one true power,"I am down to the last 60 pages of this book and NOTHING has happened! Rand had one confrontation in some alley. That's it! There is a lot of women bickering with one another, we get to hear everyone's deepest thoughts and view the most mundane of actions in grueling detail. In my opinion, Jordan is drinking deeply of the one true power (MONEY). At this rate he is going to write 20 more books in this series and be only halfway to the end, but Blood and Bloody Ashes! I am probably going to buy them all! I'm hooked. Oh well the wheel weaves as the wheel wills...."
3,Again?,"Good lord, man, finish it already.I am getting more and more demoralized by Mr. Jordan. I began book 1 when book 2 came out and have patiently bought each volume since. I don't know that I can handle another.The stories were fantastic but have since declined into repetitive and monotonous filler. I hate to see such an amazing and grand franchise fall so low.The books themselves are fantastic. The epic story is tremendous and offers the reader access to a dramatic world with realistic approaches to myth and magic. The main characters introduced in the first two volumes have become overburdened with plot twists and literary short cuts, but still reverberate strongly. Mat Cauthon is as real to me as some of my friends (and all of my co-workers).Do I recommend the series? Yes. . .but I have to say that the series has gone on too long and the reader should be prepared to be bored from book 6-9. Hopefully book 10 will revitalize me."
4,Finally!,"The series is at last starting to feel climatical. Rand and company overcome (or at least it seems that way) a pivotal antagonist while further evolving in character. A lot of the questions I had have been answered, to some extent, in this latest chapter. My only problem lies in the first few chapters that deal with Perrin's plight; an outcome is never reached. The book is amazing though."
3,Approaching the end,"If you haven't begun reading the Wheel of Time series yet. My advice, like others, is to wait. I started reading the series in the early 90's when book four had come out, and really liked it. I have too much time wrapped up in it to not complete it, but it's lost a lot of the charm it once had.I'd say the series is great through book six, but after the Wells of Dumai, something's changed. I think Jordan may either a) be tired of writing about these same characters or b) letting pressure from the publisher to put the books out before they're complete screw up the series.My biggest complaint is that in the beginning, major plot lines in the books were wrapped up in the same novel. Now, unless it's Rand, we're having to wait five to six years for plot line resolvation (is that a word?), which means that while there may be an overall outline, the individual books aren't outlined anymore.Wait for the movie, kids."
4,I honestly don't remember 80% of the characters anymore.,"Like most people I have enjoyed this series since the beginning. However with each new volume coming out, I remember less and less of the previous characters. When you read the first few chapters and don't remember half of them, that's a problem. I guess I'm gonna have to go a re-read all of them before volume 10 arrives or I'm gonna be totally lost.However, even if I didn't remember the characters, I did remember the overall plot, so I was very happy when the big, hairy, epic moments began happening. The cleansing of the male half of the magic was a loooooong time in coming. I was going to give this 3 stars, if it weren't for the last few chapters. The battle-royale between tons of characters was one of the best battle-sequences I have EVER read! I hope the next one has that same level of excitement!"
2,A shame,"I'm afraid Robert Jordan's good writing stopped at Book 6. It hasn't started up again. The plot-line has become glacially slow and RJ only seems interested in: (a) drawing out the nuances of the tiniest of inter-personal relationships between his main good characters that NO-ONE cares about (braid-tug, sniff etc); (b) creating new characters no-one will ever remember; (c) forgetting about those existing characters that one does recall (hello, RJ, there's one called Mat); (d) laughing up his sleeve at fans puzzling to work out the Adeleas/Asmodean/Demandred threads that have been happening for, oh, 3-4 books now & badly need to be cleared up. And only spiced up at the end after the publishers realised that nothing had happened in the book. I'm waiting for someone to write a 100 page summary of books 7-9. Shouldn't take long."
2,Addiction,"Reading Robert Jordan is like being addicted to drugs. Before you read it, you know that you shouldn't do it. It won't be good for you. But you can't help yourself. You have to get that Rand Fix. Once you start, you can't stop. But when its over, you are left feeling a little worse than before. You realize that the reality does not match with the expectation.Robert Jordan needs to have something happen in his books. There are a number of storylines that are started and dropped. Why even start the book with Perrin and Faile? Their story disappears.What is the need to introduce ""Seekers of Truth""? We all know that Terry Goodkind has taken liberties in the ""Sword or Truth"" series, but why does Jordan recipricate.Robert Jordan needs to get the story moving. We need to finish some stories and create new, and more interesting, plots surrounding Rand."
3,A step up from the previous book,"Like one reviewer said and I concur, the hardback books are no longer worth it anymore. I will wait for paperbacks, or I may just stop reading this series all together."
4,sheer escapisism,"while i must conceed that this book is better than the last few, the whole series has been great.because i have waited impatiently for the next in the series, i find that i tend to read very quickly to finish the book. however the story is so gripping and so well planned and constructed, that i find that i can reread after a while and enjoy the book as much if not more than reading it for the first time.if you are so fed up of the series - don't read it. or wait until the whole series is complete. i find that the attention to the detail and mundane matters makes the escape that much more real.it is the mark of an author if he / she can make you live with - like or dislike the characters and can make you wait for 10 years to finish the series.besides if the series was finished what else would you read ? thanx to robert jordaan for allowing us to share this."
3,Agh,"I think that becouse of constant pressure and breack neck pace of writing , jordan run out of steam. It happens to the best of them, stephen king and anne rice are the best examples. What he needs is to kick back take a few deep breaths and lay the series off for 5 years or so. Let the ideas tricle back. While RJ does tie up major plot lines and has some progress, most of the book (99.9%) is still cannon fodder. HE needs to focus and have a story line for a chance. The only reason why i m still reading is becouse of my reading style. I have read his book in three days by skipping all the irrelevant plot details. Skimming until i got to the juicy parts. I reconmend any other reader to to the same and if RJ is reading this, take a breack man youve done enouth."
2,It's Ebay Time,"Look, everyone seems to be hacking at Jordan now because his once great epic story seems to be bogged down in repetitive descriptions, slow moving plot, added, useless plot lines and slumber parties. Well, I would like to join in. This sucks. I am nine books into a series that should've been over by now. I've been limping along (like so many) since book eight and clearly Jordan has lost his ability, his nerve and his voice. I'm only hoping there are enough die hards out there to buy my collection on Ebay.Mr. Jordan: You should feel like Al Gore, you are done, you just have no idea."
2,If you have to...,I may have written a review for this book already but I'm writing another one. I think it got a higher rating than it should have. Book eight kind of lagged and nine was much worse. I don't even want to read ten. Jordan better make his books better. I was dissapointed with this book and I will be quite angry if the rest of the series is like this.
1,Looking up again,"UNlike some of the previous works in this series, this one contains very little filler. Major plot turns happen regularly, and no characters are utterly forgotten. However, it's simply not as strong as the early books in the series were, though it's a considerable improvement over those immediately before it."
2,still too slow,"OK, we know Robert Jordan is arguably the best fantasy writer since Tolkien (or was till George RR Martin started his series), but he's now lost the plot. Literally. From a gripping first three books, to a mediocre second three through to a far too slow and intricate third three that add almost nothing to the overall plot and don't take it very much further. And Winter's Heart is no real exception -- still far too much braid pulling and blushing by the female characters and not enough dialogue or action or historical reference points. I'm very pleased Mr Jordan is now making lots more money than if he had kept this the tighter 5-6 book series he clearly originally planned, but he has now completely wasted his historic opportunity to create something of lasting merit and now is merely doing something good. Still a clear cut above the rest of the field, but well below what we know he is himself capable of. A great pity."
2,I Agree,"I Have to agree with North Olmstead, Ohio, the series has gone down hill since book 7, i am really tired of reading about all the pretty dresses the ladies are wearing. Get on with story of Rand and finish it off, it's time to start something new. BTW, George RR Martin has passed you by Mr Jordan, he is a great storyteller. Bring it on George, i'll have plenty of cash now that i'm not buying WOT anymore."
2,Make the hurting stop ! End the damn series already!,"The wheel of time series. Loved the first few books - but really, I started getting bored after book 4. There all more or less the same after that. How many plot twists can I endure before I finally stop caring. And what the heck is the deal with Robert Jordans female characters ? Is it just me or are they schitzophranic wenches or what ?"
2,too much and not enough,"I have spent much time reading this series. I started late and read the first 8 books in succession. Now, waiting for the next book and wishing for something more, I am left wanting. This book is too much. Needless detail on needless people and things. I wish that the story would start anew, as in the first few books of this series, when I cared about what was going on and who the characters actually were. But, if you are like me and have invested so much time in reading this block of books, it is hard to walk away. My shoes are on."
2,Disappointing - Jordon is not focused anymore.,"Jordon goes on and on about useless and boring details which does not adhere to the standards he set earlier in the series. Very few things really happen in the book. If you want you could skip 75% of the book very easily.. I'm still a big fan of the series... but not sure how long I can keep up after last two books...Jordon, wake up...."
4,Of course it's excellent,"Almost all the main characters (only Egwene is missing) share the limelight in this important addition to the saga. There are numerous twists and turns in the tale which advance several character issues and plot directions. Rand and Nynaeve work together (actually, they've become a real action team) to bring about a fundamental change in the nature of the world. Good stuff. But then, any book that features the post-Aelfinn Mat Cauthon is good. Mat - supernaturally gifted, sardonic, witty, and yet in some ways still a naive boy from the outback - is one of the most engaging characters I have ever encountered in literature. I cannot help but laugh with gusto whenever I read about his antics, and yet admire his bravery and fortitude. Jordan has given us distinctive characters that hold together and ring true after thousands of pages. Start at the beginning, read 'em all, and reread them often. Only ""Lord of the Rings"" wears as well or better. Bon voyage."
1,Please.. Please.. Please.. Make an end!,"I must join the chorus of folks who've grown weary of the wheel of time that will never end. I've bought each of the volumes in HB as they were released, and I don't want to add up the total I've spent. I loved the first few volumes, but they've gone downhill from there. ""Winter's Heart"" is better than ""Path of Daggers,"" but not by much."
1,"More money, less enjoyment","Like a lot of other reviewers, I find this series more irritating as it goes along. It gets really confusing - you read pages not having a clue who you're reading about until suddenly you remember, or you read something that rings a bell, and you have to go back and reread it. A full list of characters at the back of the book would help, and also maybe a synopsis...."
2,disappointing,"I must say that after reading all of the books in the series up until now, I am very disappointed. Even though the ending of this book is OK, there are still to many unanswered questions, too many sub stories to follow. In his first few books of the series, I enjoyed the plots because they were relatively few and easy to follow. Now though, there are too many plots and questions; when is the series going to actually approach some sort of ending? The way things are going, it will take another 9 books, especially if Jordan continues to answer half the questions posed by previous books and introduces more than were answered. I really wish I could give the book more stars but in good conscience, I can't."
2,Finish the damn series for Gods sake!,"Nearly 800 pages and only one major event took place in this book. Ever since the dragon reborn, this series has begun to drag....and drag!. It took 300 pages in Winters Heart for anything significant to occur. The book kept my interest....but just barely. Robert Jordan spends entirely too much time setting the scene and describing the battles of will between the HUNDREDS of characters is these books. It is nearly impossible to keep every character straight. I very nearly did not purchase this book because of the same long windedness in the previous 6 books. If this series extends beyond 10 books, I will give up on Robert Jordan and the Wheel of Time series."
1,"Too Little, Too Late","Once again, Mr. Jordan has toh to all all his faithful readers. The tip off that this book was going to be more of the same nonsense is the title - Winters Heart. Very exciting, huh? In the future, if there is no verb in the title, I'm going to think twice about buying any book.Jordan seems to get some perverse pleasure by creating endless new characters who are virtually undistinguishable from other characters - there must be 1,000 by now. Who cares about them?Imagine the excitement and power of a final book that resolved all of the major prophecies. If Jordan had decided to make a 5-book series, we would be happily into the sequels 5-book series now. There is absolutely no point to a 10,11,12. . .part series, other than to be greedy and an egomaniac.Jordan could have been *THE* Fantasy writer of the century - but he continues to diminish himself by dragging this out and spoonfeeding us bits and pieces."
2,"Mr. Jordan Seems to be ""milking"" the series","I agree with Rich from Canada. Not again..., November 18, 2000 I was disappointed with Crown of Swords and Winter's Heart is even further evidence that Mr Jordan has run out of ideas or is trying to milk the series for all the money he can get. This series has become a soap opera with no action, no plot, and no momentum; ""just endless scenes of pointless bickering, traveling, and whining, with a tiny bit of action thrown in at the end of each book"". I will wait until the next one is in the library before reading it."
1,Literary M@sturb@tion,This is yet another in what's become a looooong line of:1) Jordan's introduction of dozens and dozens of irrelevant characters2) Eyeball-glazing descriptions of irrelevant places & items3) Fights with the forsaken that end in either escape or are reincarnated by the dark one4) Expounding upon a dizzying array of barely relevant subplots5) RJ expecting author-worship for every tree-killing page he spews forthI humbly propose a boycott on this series until the story is moved substantially closer to it's finish.
2,the plot thickens and my skin thins,"I quickly became a fan of Jordan at the onset of the WoT series. I had read some of his other stuff, jumped headlong into this particular series, and quickly became miffed around book six.While I enjoy the plot, the neverending line of new characters, subplots, minor drivel between inconsequential characters and a diluted diatribe have turned me off.Jordan doesn't keep the reader enthralled at this junction in the series. It is quite beyond time to wrap this series up and move on. DO NOT begin this lump of work unless you enjoy the aforementioned.With the amount of time I've invested, I'll continue the series, but I don't recommend it to anyone else."
3,When Will It End?,"I started this series many moons ago when the first book came out. Since years pass between the release of each book, I'm losing track of the characters, plots, and which book I'm on. I don't think it's a lack of intelligence or reading ability on my part--I have a bachelor's degree in English and an MBA.Meanwhile, I can't help but notice that Mim gets glimpses of the future, but it's a future that shows no sign of coming about."
1,Is there a cliff notes version???? Please,"In all my years of reading, I have come to the conclusion that no writter is capable of keeping a story going longer than 3 books. I don't know if I will be able to finish this one. It has so many meaningless plots and characters that its impossible to keep up with what's going on. And in a lot of parts there is a lot of dialog or whatever and nothing happens. Parts of the book seem to exist that should have been removed by an editor. What I would love to know is, where was Jordan going early on. Did he loose the original idea? Anyway, I'm sorry to say. Don't buy this book. If you have to read it. Go to a library or borrow it from some poor fool who bought it like me..."
2,Oy!,"I'm not going to tell you anything different from the other million reviewers on here. In a nutshell, very little happens in this book to further the story that Jordan began so promisingly... NINE books and more than three THOUSAND pages ago. He hops around in the story like a child that's eaten too many sweets, and manages to move his plot lines along not a whit. If you've read this far in the series you'll probably finish this novel and read the next when it comes out. You won't really enjoy it though. Even Rand, who I thought was the most exciting character to follow in the first seven books, is flat and one dimensional. So, I will await the next book, without bated breath, and will purchase it despite the queasy feeling in my stomach brought on by the thirty dollar price tag. Oy!And apparently those fellows at Tor were awful rushed trying to get this masterpiece out for Christmas judging by all those typos."
2,Wait for the Paperback,"Another disappointment. What Jordan does in 100 words, most authors do in 10. This series started out great but in the last few books, it's just dragged on. I have about 10 years into this series and I'm just about at the point of saying enough is enough. There has been so many characters and subplots introduced it's difficult to figure out what's happened between books. It's almost as if Jordan does not know where he's going with it and hoping he will think up something. In the meantime, he is getting rich writting crap. Get with it Jordan and move this series along."
1,I give up...,"This series started out fantastically, but having read Terry Goodkind(now that's a man that knows how to save a series!) and others, Jordan is a waste of my time. This is the first book I will have ever only partially read. I've read 200 pages or so and have agonized over those. See ya 'round Jordan."
3,"Average ""Wheel of Time"" Filler","""Winter's Heart"" is mediocre filler for the ""Wheel of Time"" series. The plot is sluggish, at times almost coming to a complete standstill, but it's not made up with character development at all! Instead the complete opposite happens. Rand, Elayne, Mat, the Seanchan, the Forsaken, etc. devolve to childish one-dimensional characters. Lots of sex and talk about sex, giggling and needless chatter. Felt more like a cheesy cartoon than a serious fantasy epic. The few plot-twists are amateurish and can be seen from a mile away. With the finale so rushed and hastily arranged it's downright comical. But to be fair I think these rough edges will probably smooth out once the epic is completed and able to be read uninterrupted. It's just not a great book solely by itself, a momentary blip in the great ""Wheel of Time""."
2,The Wheel Of Boring,"As much as I enjoyed the first 5 books in Mr. Jordan's saga, I hve been very disappointed with his latest additions. Winter's Heart continues his passion for long winded, over done descriptions, with enough characters to make your head spin, and a story line that goes nowhere until the final 50 pages. It's time for the author to step back and look at what made his first books so enjoyable, an engaging and fast moving plot with a group of characters you actually cared about."
3,Not close to the best work but a turn for the better,"Out of the last three books this is definitely the best. I hate to see the series in this postion though considering I burned through the first 8 books in about as many weeks. At the end of book eight what I was looking forward too was the Tower war the to have Egwene be non existant was a let down. But hes been doing this sort of thing with Perrin and Matt for ages so I guess its par for the course. Rand, for me, finally got interesting as a character with this book I finally got to see him go back to working with Lan.For me this book is the fulcrum Ill buy the next one but if its more the same Ill probably give up on the series all together untill its finished."
4,"Not the best, but still a good read.","Although this has been the best series I have ever read (and I think I have read each book at least 4 times) I think it's starting to slow down a bit. I would love to say each one gets better, but the first book (which I would rate about 6 stars) is still the best. I liked Winter's Heart very much though."
3,Again??,"RJ writes about the same old thing AGAIN.. This book is not that bad , it ties up all lot of loose plot ends and mysteries. Like whether saidin could be cleansed or not. Or the identtites of the 'reborn' Forsaken. However his writings leaves much to be desired. Unlike the first 6 books , where the plot was fast moving, this is rather slow. And where is MOIRAINE?? With all clues pointing to her return, where is she?? (Maybe she might still come back later in the series, but that's alittle late, isn't it)However , I give praise to its FANTASTIC ending. That practically saves the book."
4,Solid Fantasy,Good solid work on a great series. Now that it is finished I'm rereading to refresh my memory. I'm looking for good stuff form Brandon.
5,was a gift.,got it for Husband. He said it was great. it arrived in great shape too. So I would recommend these books to anyone that wants an adventure.
3,A pretty good entry for a late one...,"I read this and liked it. The camera was held pretty tightly on the action. It let Mr. Jordan write in his active style, and when he does that I find that I like his books in this series somewhat better. The trade-off is that we don't get a lot of sweeping action sequences, but that's a good thing here. The claustrophobic view is held on individual characters and so we get to see more intimately the actions they undertake in the story. In other words, what we do get is less ""watered down"" than the stuff we read in, say, The Fires of Heaven."
3,A spectacular finish saves this book,"Sadly, the pedantic prose of Book 8 creeps into this book frequently and early on in Winter's Heart. It takes quite some time for anything of consequence to take place. The return of Mat's plotline definitely helps, but the Faile/Perrin chapters are stuck in the mud and a waste of pages. It's not until the final scene (which is foreshadowed at the beginning) do we get a return to Jordan's great writing in the first four books of the series. The shifting viewpoints from all of the main players in that scene really build up the suspense and deliver an ending that put the series back after seriously slipping in Book 8."
2,Not Free SF Reader,"Don't care any more after two dull books in a row. Perrin has to find his kidnapped wife, Mat actually does a bit of potential wife kidnapping.Rand gets vengeful on traitorous elements among his magic dudes.The Aes Sedai continue to bicker, like, well, violent sorceresses.Sound familiar? Sounds long and drawn out and badly in need of editing, basically."
3,Get on with it man.,"Robert, dude, you loosing steam in this series. I could live with the first five volumes and then its just starting to drag out endlessly. I will still have to read through to Book 11, but it's starting to kill me."
3,"3 1/2 Stars, actually","A year or so ago, after trying to read this novel twice, I turned my back on Jordan. No more, I thought. Never again. Well, I tried to get away, but they pulled me back in.Actually, I was just too curious.All of the faults of this over-bloated epic are here in force--the repetition, the non-stop skirt-tugging and sniffing and glaring and eyebrow-scrunching and endless bickering between characters who really, by this point, should have more important things to worry about. Minor cast members come tumbling in, only to be introduced at length so that they can utter one or two lines of dubious importance and move aside for the next one. It's enough to make you tug on your braid, isn't it?However, the plot DOES move forward, if only in baby steps. I skimmed sometimes, but I kept reading. Call me crazy, but I'm going to keep slogging on to part 10 to see what happens next."
1,Wheel of Time needs winding up.,"I have read all of the Wheel of Time series and have become dismayed at the change in style with the last three books. Mr. Jordan is belaboring old issues and is not at all clear how new ones relate to the plot. He does nothing to assist the reader's memory in recalling characters and their importance. A prologue would help or, at least, a more elaborate glossary which includes the dozens of minor repeated characters, locations, and events. Certainly one motivation for this stretching out of the story would be to continue his revenue; his editor would gain by that tactic also. For number 10 and beyond I will wait for others to read and review his production and not automatically get the book."
3,"Close, but no cigar.","For those of us who have been eagerly awaiting each of Jordan's books, hoping that finally-- finally!-- the story will actually go somewhere, this book is a dissapointment. Not much actual progress is made until the very last few pages of the book, which seem like theycould have come a couple hundred pages earlier. It has its good parts, though. Mat reappears, Rand confesses his love to the feminine trio, and something actually happens with the One Power. It's difficult to see when the end of this series actuall arrives, but when it does, I'm sure we'll all be relieved."
3,Jordan Coasting on Foregone Conclusions,"I have been reading the series for nine years. I was hoping that RJ would get back on the plot development bus, but instead he has chosen to write mind-numbingly boring descriptions of Elayne's political dillemas, and a completely pointless section on Perrin. Bottom line, if you haven't started the series yet, wait another four years to start. If you have, go and read; it's too late for us to stop now."
2,And I love the series?!,"This book is about 90% mush and 10% plot advancement. ""The Eye of The World"" entranced me from the first chapter and kept me going straight through the next 8 books. Then I had to stop and wait, and wait, and wait, and finally ""Winter's Heart"" arrived. The worst part is I bought it in hardback, oh! the money! I love this series, I greatly enjoy this author, but he is falling into the trap so many epic authors succumb to. Where do we go from here? So many fights, so much heroism, so many twists, is Jordan beginning to lose the threads? I hope not because even now, so many months and years after beginning this series, I still occasionally wonder, what's going to happen to Rand? Mr. Jordan, are we there yet?"
2,Series starts well!,"When I picked up the first book of this series I was pleasantly surprised. Good characters, nice story line, good action. Unfortunately, book two wasn't quite up to par. Book three a little worse, book four even worse...you get the picture. Way to much time spent on needless details and insignificant characters. Books 6,7,8,9 were a major struggle. Save yourself the time, read books 1 and 2, and create the rest of the story on your own."
5,Jordan does it again!,I enjoyed this book and found it a very fun read. I do think he has too many charactors but it is still good. If you liked the other W.O.T books you'll like this one.
4,GOOD GOOD GOOD,"I have to say this is a very good book, despite everything I read. It wasnt that boring. Some things were necesary. Plots so intrincate and complicated need time to unravel; I do have to say that I ve forgotten half of the characters and got really angry to read more new plots beginning again... Nontheless I think finally there is, as the end says: ""A message of hope"" that Jordan will finish this series soon enough. I love it as much as I hate it because now that I ve finished Winter s Heart I need to keep on reading more and more. I did not give the book five stars just because of this eternity. Please , please Jordan bring up the 10th one and help us get through with this soon!"
2,"Terrible, except the last chapter","Found myself skipping over half the book due to elaborate details about womens clothing and their squabbles. Criminey.1000 pages about women straightening their skirts and wondering if they were showing to much 'bosom' Excuse me, wasn't this an adventure series at one point?Lost in the wilderness, they stumbled upon Redbook...and that was all she wrote. Jordan says he is going to write until they nail his coffin shut. He's nailing it shut himself..neat trick.R."
1,"Review of series, not just book","OK, I thought fantasy was supposed to be fun, supposed to take you away. This series has gotten harder to read than a John LeCarre novel. Granted Winter's Heart is better than the past few books, but I am beginning to believe I deserve at least a dinner and a movie for what Jordan is doing to me. Like everyone else, I just want to see the end. And if you are like me and remember when fantasy was fun, do what I did and go back and read Edding's Belgariad or The Lord of the Rings and see if you still have patience left for this series. At the end of the Belgariad I still cared about those characters and was disappointed to see their story end (until the Mallorean) but with the WOT I hope they all die in Book 10 and we wrap this up. Who truly cares anymore? Lucas will make 5 more Star Wars movies before this thing is done."
1,Its Like Watching an Old Boxer Get the Snot Beat Out of Him,"I wonder how much Jordan has been manipulated by his Editor and Publisher. Milk it baby! He has probably described ""wool dress"" close on 1,000 times. I remember reading about a proposed 8 volumes about five years ago. This garbage is no better than a soap opera and is probably worse since formulaic suspense has at least a rhythm and flow that is predictable and comforting. This stuff is like a car that's missing on one cylinder. So much incredible promise having degenerated into such pathos - its a crying shame."
2,Had enough!,"Mr. Jordan has finally gone too far by not going far enough. I've been faithful from the beginning, but this one reads like a bad soap opera and his fixation with manipulative women borders on boring. Too many characters, too many subplots and not enough happening to the main characters, at least I assume Rand is a main character. The menage-a-trois plus one is too much. I enjoyed the series up until Path of Daggers, held out hope for a conclusion with that one and now there will be yet another book, which patterns woven tell me will also not end it. At this point I don't care if it never ends, I'm finished. Read it at your own risk, but be prepared to skim pages just to find out IF anything is happening. A real disappointment for what was a potentially good story - in the distant beginning."
2,Much ado about nothing much....,"I've been an avid reader of the series, enjoying each successive Jordan missive as they've been releases. For books 4-8, I re-read the entire series before reading the latest release, just for the continuity and because the books are, well, re-readable.But now...ugh!See, to me, it's all about ""suspension of disbelief""...or, in other words, the ability to be immersed in a story line so convincing that your right-brain takes over and mundane things, such as time, cease to be.Just didn't happen in this book. I actually found myself forcing my hands to pick up and continue where I had lost dropped the tome in distracted disgust. I think this is the last Jordan issue I will buy. Part of my problem with the story line is that the characters lose their ""other ordinariness"" because they take so damn long to *make* things happen. Rand as a re-active (as opposed to proactive) character just isn't a convincing sell.Sorry...on to other novels..."
2,Robert Jordan does not deserve our loyalty.,"Ah, it coulda been good. If only we could rewind to book 5 or 6 and take away all the bad, boring nothingness between all the great character building and plot. I feel personally betrayed, as at this point I have invested god knows how many hours in pouring over this story, and I think jordan has actually gone and stopped telling it."
4,Welcome back RJ,"I have to say, He's baaaack. After muddling through books 7 & 8, the story line came back to what had me enthralled with the first five books. I read the book in three sittings including a flight to Texas to visit my daughter who is also reading the series.The original main characters have returned to the lime light. They are again playing major roles, and it seems that all the loose ends will soon be tied up. I hope Moiraine Sedai returns."
2,BORINGG,"I feel as if Robert Jordan ran out of steam and is trying to milk as much money from this series as possible before readers catch on to his scheme. I absolutely LOVE the first five or six books now but I have lost a lot of my interest. I didn't even finish book 9. It usually would take me a day or two to finish a good book. But after three weeks, I cannot find myself reading any more of Winter's Heart. It is a little bit better than book 7 where nothing was accomplished. My attention is now drawn to the Sword of Truth series. check it out if you haven't already"
1,Go Back To Writing Conan.......,"Dear Robert,I recommend you stop wasting everyones time and hard earned cash and complete this mess. Go back to writing 128 page Conan books or better yet just stop writing period. Anyone interesting in reading a story with substance pick-up some George R R Martin.I for one will never buy anything written by Robert Jordan ever again."
1,Complete waste of time,"This book could easily have fit into 200 pages of higher quality writing. I'm sick of the cardboard cut-out characters and repititious descriptions. 680 pages of absolutely nothing. I loved books 1 - 5 and I even liked 6. Books 7, 8 , 9??? Why bother...the story summaries given on the net provide better reading and won't waste 20 hours of your life.Jordan has the talent...he absolutely needs to cut [this stuff out]."
2,Please make it stop!,"Would someone please smack the editors at TOR and tell them they are doing Bob a disservice by allowing him to DRAG this series out? The series should have been completed in six volumes max! As I read, I found myself skipping the unnecessary chapters that focused on minor characters because I don't care enough about them to bother reading their stories.I am so fed up that I refuse to buy the books anymore. I only read them when a friend loans one to me. Please, someone, anyone, make it stop before my friends waste any more money on Bobby J's annuity!"
3,BOOOORING!,600+ pages of ABSOLUTELY NOTHNG. It seems Rob Jordan's only concern is dragging this series out to make as much money as possible. Some of the main characters are not even mentioned in this book.
5,Makes you crave for the remaining books,"Great sequel to the best fantasy epic I have ever read. Can't wait for the remaining parts. Jordan is a master in creating characters and making you love them, hate them, and think about them whether you are reading one of his books or just going about your day."
4,Getting there.,"OK, so there was too much filler in there.. but those last 50 pages made up for it all, they really did! Hey, even if i have to read another 600 pages in the next book to another 50 pages like that, i will. Robert J, you must know yourself that those last pages were awesome, you have such a tallent, PLEASE bring it on!!"
4,Finally Jordan is on the path to redemption,"For all of those who say that too little happened in A Path of Dagger and A Crown Of Swords I agree with you. Jordan could have not written those two books and nothing would have changed. Yet in this book he does not give the reader a whole lot (certainly less than in the first five books), but there are some monumental changes that make this book worth reading if you wish to read the rest of the series. For those who truley loved the first five give this one a try and read it all the way to the end and you will find that the series is starting to pick up again."
5,getting back to his better style,"I've been reading Robert Jordan since i was in Jr. high, and soon i will be a senior in college. this new book ran much of the way like the last few, which isnt all that good, and somwhat depressing, but the last 100 pages made up for the last 3 books alltogether. The last pages are much like the style Jordan had for books 1, 3, 4, and in parts of 5. (book 2 was good but was much like books 7 and 8) and that kept me reading the last 100 pages straight through."
5,This is how i like a Jordan Book,"With the last book used as a setup, this one showed more of the excitement that Lord Of Chaos and Fires of Heaven showed. It rekindled the Mat storyline which i was glad to see and it had that action packed ending i always love. Im glad he left some storylines hanging so the next book will be similar to this one and not another setup book like Path of Daggers...now if i can only wait that long."
3,Need I say more...,"I'm sitting here reading reviews of this book, trying to determine whether I should go ahead and purchase books 6 through 9. You see, I haven't read them yet. I made it part way through 6 and then lost interest. My wife bought me number 7 for Christmas a while back, and I haven't even opened it.What startles me is that I've read about 50 reviews so far, many of which contained ""spoilers."" None of the spoilers surprised me, and I was familiar with all the plot lines referred to by the reviews.Scary, huh?"
4,Slowly getting better,"With the exception of the last 100 pages of this book, Winter's Heart is just as over-inflated and boring as the previous two. I am tired of reading about women's dresses! I am tired of infinite sub-plots that are never revealed. What about the land beyond the waste? What about the athan mere and their Coramoor? Lets resolve the sub-plot with Matt, Rand and the Seanchan already! And how about an end to Elaida!Anyway, like all WOT fans, I am frustrated with this series. But the ending of this book is momentus and offers a promise of more to come. If you don't read the book and unless someone clues you in, you will be a little lost in the next book. This is more than I can say for the last two."
2,A Long Days Journey Into Futility,"Well here we are Book 9 of the Wheel of Time series and I still scratch my head wondering why I continue to bother. True, as others have mentioned, after investing so much time in this, it's almost mandatory reading now, as if I was still in school. Winter's Heart is an improvement over the preceding 3 books, but it in no way captures the spirit of the early volumes. Jordan is obviously in it only for the money now and suckers like me will continue to line his pockets. The ending by the way, had the potential to be terrific, but Jordan drops the ball by failing to complete the narrative action on many of the point of view set pieces. He becomes lazy by setting up the individual conflicts then abandons them. You only discover threads of what transpired when it's all over. Very sloppy, and not considerate to the reader who had to endure much minutia before reaching the climax."
4,Getting Better,"Crown of Swords marked the begining of a comeback for Jordan. It's so hard to keep track of all the characters and I(a big Robert Jordan fan) think it's quite annoying. But this Winters Heart does a great job for Jordan, making this one of my favorites. The plot doesn't change to much and there's more characters to keep in track with, but he's writing the script a lot tighter in stead of long wordy thoughts.The ending of this book is awesome. It's the best ending so far in the series and Robert Jordan does a pretty good job it most of his endings."
2,"Here's Book 9, now pay me.","Okay. I have read, waited, forgotten, read again, waited, forgotten. I started this series years ago, when it had promise, and like everyone else, I am sick of this drawn out drivel Mr. Jordan is passing for a fantasy novel. It all boils down to this: He is padding his retirement portfolio! What was originally going to be an eight to ten book series, has ballooned into the 'teens! Or more, from what I've heard!It's all about the Benjamins now. Too bad, as this series was one of the best, if not the best, since Tolkein. Then came Book Seven...then Eight...then Nine. God forbid Mr. Jordan should have a heart attack. We'd never know how the series ends."
2,Winter's Heart,"Even though this was sold new, two of the CDs were defective and chapters could not be listened to. In the auto, even the slightest bump caused the cds to skip."
3,Great find,this is a great book from a series. they are hard to find in hard cover. Even their own web site sells them for more than double Amazons prices.
3,Barely An Improvement,"Better than the last one, but just. Something important happens in this book, which is more than I can say for the last few. If you're still with the Wheel of Time, I guess you should read this one. What a ringing endorsement, huh?"
3,Desde el principio al fin!,"He leeído la colección completa de la serie ""The Wheel of Time"" escrita por Robert Jordan. Al igual que muchos de los lectores de ficción épica que inicialmente nos enviciamos con los primeros libros de esta serie, tengo que reconocer que los últimos cuatro libros dejan mucho que desear y pueden catalogarse como engorrosos y aburridos. Para el próximo a salir esperaré por la revisión de otros lectores y/o la versión en carpeta blanda que resulta más barata y menos dolorosa la decepción de resultar tan mala como los últimos tres libros (The Wheel of Time Books 7, 8 y 9). Es una pena por que la serie prometía mucho en los primeros libros, pero parece que Jordan quiere estirar demasiado la trama."
5,"Not the Best, not the Worst...","Winter's Heart had the best ending since Lord of Chaos and Dumai's Wells, but was slow the first 200 pages but picked up greatly and didn't stop. Then you add Mat and his shenanigan's, the girls bonding Rand, and a bunch of answers to questions everybody has been asking (who's Cyndane? Is Dashiva Osan'gar? Is Taim Demandred?) What you have is a book that pleases the nitpickers and the casual readers alike, and I imagin Jordan will be relieved to discover that the majority of readers enjoyed it immensely.Also Recamended: The Harry Potter series by J.K. Rowling, The Saga of Darren Shan series by Darren Shan, The Lord of the Rings by J.R.R. Tolkin, The Shannara series by Terry Brooks, The Left Behind series by Tim LaHayn and Jerry B. Jenkins, and the Remnants series by K.A. Applegate"
4,The wheel picks up the pace and turns faster...,"Everyone knows that the Wheel of TIme series is excellent through The Fires of Heaven. Lord of Chaos, although it did have its moments (coughcoughDUMAI'S WELLScoughcough), was overburdened with too much politics. Its name shoulda been ""How to [Anger] Aes Sedai in Three Easy Steps."" A Crown of Swords and The Path of Daggers started to pick up the pace a little, but some events got dragged out way too much. Although this fault keeps up in Winter's Heart, it is much better and puts some adventure back into this epic.Although Egwene ought to have deposed Elaida, Elayne should be queen be now (and why doesn't RJ just go ahead and kill Faile already???), there are some truly great parts, such as Mat's return to the series in Seanchan-occupied Eby Dar, and Rand's quest to cleanse the Dark One's tain from Saidin. Although Winter's Heart isn't the return of WoT in full force, it does promise an amazing (The Shadow Rising-Quality) sequel."
1,Its Like Watching an Old Boxer Get the Crap Beat Out of Him,"I wonder how much Jordan has been manipulated by his Editor and Publisher. Milk it baby! He has probably described ""wool dress"" close on 1,000 times. About [.....] for the latest in the series too. I remember reading about a proposed 8 volumes about five years ago. This garbage is no better than a soap opera and is probably worse since formulaic suspense has at least a rhythm and flow that is predictable and comforting. This stuff is like a car that's missing on one cylinder. So much incredible promise having degenerated into such pathos - its a crying shame."
2,"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","I strongly suggest not buying any of these ""The Wheel of Time"" series books until the final conclusion book is out in paperback. It just isn't worth hardback dollars.Sadly, I would not be suprised if Roberts Jordan's creative talents ever again rise to anywhere near the level that he had before starting ""The Wheel of Time series."" Mr. Jordan's creative ability has been so misused by this publisher, who seeks to get so many volumes out of a good story that the story begins to die of boredom, that it may have been deeply harmed. He has spent about 10 years doing this series and probably has lost his creative desire and is left with a talent that is covered with mold and dust.This story is one that has been page stuffed well beyond the 3 volumes it could easily be condensed into. Mostly, when the series is finally (if ever) concluded, it need to be sent to the Reader's Digest staff to be condensed into it's proper size."
2,Another tedious entry in the series,This is another tedious entry in this seemingly endless series. Jordan needs to start wrapping it up. He's losing his audience.
3,How many more are to come and how long is the wait?,"As always Mr. jordan writes a good book, what this lacks from the previous books is the character interaction. He describes the scenes in vivid detail, but he leaves out how this affects the characters themselves. In this book he resolved a lot of issuses that readers speculated about for along time but he started a lot more with no end in sight. I like how he describes Rand's struggle with stress, Mat's problems with women, and Perrin's despreration to find his wife. I hope we see in the next volume the consequences of Rand's enemies and allies continually pushing their own good ahead of everyone elses. Other than that this book was insightful into the world Mr. Jordan has made famous. Can't wait for the next one."
3,Better than the last few,"This isn't 9th and I gotta believe last 're-read of the series as we approach the release of the last e-book in April. I am enjoying it but I am glad to be getting closer to the end. If memory serves, the plot tightens up from here. Enjoyed this one more this time through."
2,LOTSA ERRORS!!!,"This book is sloooooow... at least till you get to the end. There are lots of charactors that are very unfamiliar and to make it all even worse, there are tons of gramatical errors (one of my pet peaves). The previous 8 books weren't nearly so poorly edited and there seemed to be some effort at keeping charactors somewhat familiar. It got 2 stars simply because I didn't ""HATE IT"". But I do need it to get to the next one. If book 10 is as poorly written, I probably won't be going any further in this series."
1,What more can be said?,"Well, this review is a little late in coming. I read this book a few months after it first came out (over 10 years ago). After trudging through book 8 I just kept hoping for things to get better. This book was a painful read for me. By the the end of this book the Robert Jordan rose colored glasses cracked, the spark went out, and my enjoyment of the series turned to disdain. I swore off the series because of this book. Although, after 10 years I decided to pick up book 10 to see if Jordan redeemed himself (book 10 is probably even worse).The creative reviews of this book, far, far exceed the actual book itself! A sore disappointment."
3,editing is increasingly dismal!!!,"This review is based on the Kindle version but I can't imagine the editing is different in the hardcopy. This is not so much a review of the book as a complaint about the editing. I am/was addicted to this series. I have noticed however that the editing from books seven to nine has been horrible!! I have just started book ten, and usually I am totally sucked in. But the plethora of editing mistakes even in the first few pages has made it difficult for me to continue. This sort of thing totally detracts form the pleasure of getting lost in the characters and storylines. It has become so distracting at this point that I'm afraid that as much as I want to, I won't be able to complete the series."
2,Really Unremarkable,"This installment of the series borders on unnecessary. While Mat and Rand have plot lines that are actually resolved in the end, despite hundreds of pages with no development, Perrin's quest to get Faile back continues to go unfulfilled.I loved the atmosphere of the novel. It's a shame that such a striking change in the aesthetics wasn't accompanied by a big change in the story itself. We have gone through eight books of the Wheel of Time series with no winter. Finally the natural order has been restored and we have snow-covered lands and a world of white. This changes the dynamic of the world we've come to know in interesting ways. It's not until end of the book we have great sweeping changes in the story to accompany the snow."
2,Time to put this dog to bed,This series would have been one of the BEST fantasy series ever had Jordan kept it to 4 - or maybe 5 - books. He's no longer beating a dead horse - he's now beating the greasy spot where the horse used to be.
3,"Good, but we expect better.","I liked this book. But I LOVE the series. How slow can this series get? I love the characters, I love the abundant sub-plots, and I hate the lull we seem to be in. I thought this book had an AWESOME start and finish. What happened to Perrin? We ended book 8 with Egwene beginning the war with the tower, wow that progressed in this book, NOT! I can only hold my patience in check for a book or two. Robert, HELP, I need some more action. We seem to be going in slow motion.All said a good book, but I expect better from the author who stole Tolkien's crown."
3,WINTER'S HEART,"At first all I wanted to do was throw the rotten thing away, BUT finally I did start to enjoy it. If Robert Jordan had stuck to the one storyline or joined them together in an obvious way it would have been more enjoyable. I didn't get interested in it till Rand and Cadsuane joined forces.What really burns my shorts though, is I didn't start reading these books till last year and of course I got to read the first eight one after another. The wait for this book seemed like forever and now I see after reading the other reviews that it's not unusual to have to wait two years.If I have to continue to wait that long only to have a mediocre storyline again I think I'll just stick with Kate Forsyth's books ""The Witches of Eileanan"" series."
4,"Enjoy the read, Resist the Naysayers","Winter's Heart is a nice read, with full three-dimensional detail and a complicated plot. This book is what it should be for a volume that is not the beginning or the ending of the story; a few plotlines are cleared up, but they mostly hint at more complicated layers underneath. For Jordan fans that are along for the ride and are collecting the hardbacks, get it and savor Jordan's rich descriptions and multi-leveled plots. But, if you're a casual reader, you probably should wait for the paperback."
3,Losing the thread of the story. . .,"I loved this series early on -- the detail was great, the characters seemed very fleshed out. As I grew up, I began to have a little trouble with the way women are portrayed: tempers and ""snorting"" are not always the way to handle the situation. My problem now is that with the 2 year gap between books, and all the complicated past events, I'm losing the thread. I can't remember why Mat can't remember his life and had to go back and find it in other books. For the last 3 books I've had to do this: go back and re-read sections from other books. The glossary keeps getting shorter and shorter and I can't remember what everything and everyone is these days! I still enjoy the series, but I'm thinking maybe I'll wait till the very last book is published, then buy them all and read from start to finish. If there really ever is an end . . ."
2,Jordan Not Back on Track Yet,"As with the last book in the series (Path of Daggers) I was very disappointed at the waste in failing to address the major plots and focussing on minor, boring plots. About half the book is wasted on Elayne and her political machinations to secure the throne of Andor. When Jordan finally does get around to the three main characters (the three men from Emond's Field) there finally is some action and resolution to some questions, but these interesting sections are less than half the book. The book also fails to advance chronologically. The events in Winter's Heart are contemporanius with the second half of Path of Daggers. Obviously these two books really should have been one book, but they were stretched into two books and a lot of boring filler added, making the series suffer tremendously."
1,Get a box of NO-DOZE -- you're going to need it,"I used to eagerly await new books in this series but now I've decided to walk away from it. This lastest installment is just boring. If your into political intrigue that has very little to do with plot then this is your cup of tea. However, I honestly believe that Mr. Jordan has gotten a sizable extension from his publisher and is now milking this series for as long as possible. Its a shame. It was a great series."
2,I'll be brief.,"There are two side of the issue, and a stunning debate that I'm not really qualified to approach, so I'll just say this: Jordan doesn't have an evil strong enough to carry 13 novels. He started well (really, really well), but the whole thing is getting old. And the inactivity! It's like Shakespeare stretching Hamlet out for aproximately 8,000 pages, it just isn't happening.I agree with the other reviewer that action is not the most important ingredient of a fantasy novel, but it is an ingredient. If there was an evil strong enough, this would work (maybe), but there isn't the ""presence"" that drives good, and without it, it loses urgency, and falls flat. For heaven's sake, I practically fell asleep reading the TEASER!"
2,Milking it,BRING ON TARMON GAI'DON! I'm getting tired of waiting for books that barely move characters thru the story line. I don't think I'll buy the next book.
1,*sigh* What happened?,"Winter's Heart is a big disappointment. I've read all of Mr. Jordan's Wheel of Time series and this book has little or nothing to offer. It's filled with bitchy, foul-tempered women and weak, no-impact characters. It's time to end the Wheel of Time series."
3,"Finally, altleast one of the many plot lines advance.","As a big fan of the WOT, I have watched the series slowly fade from the exciting, adventurous, and well written books(1 thru 5), to the ""see Jane run"" books(7 thru 8). Although better than the last book, Robert Jordan once again comes up a little short in advancing the plot line of his series with meaningful content. I felt this book had too much filler and not enough meat to account for over 2 years of writing. I don't mind the wait so long as it appears an effort was made to satisfy his loyal fans. Aside from the final chapter, which completes one of the major plot lines, this book....If you feel like I left you hanging, get used to it, Jordan has a knack for doing the same."
3,C-SPAN meets the light,"Jordan is unfortunately out of control of his series. As has been true for the last 3 books, I found myself skimming whole pages of descriptive text, searching for anything that appeared to be plot movement. The political and palace intrigues are better done on C-SPAN, and major plot threads are simply dropped. If you're a series fan (and you need to be to even read this review), save yourself a lot of time by checking this book out of the library and reading the last 3 chapters. You don't need to do anything more until the next book."
3,I'm beginning to yawn.,"I have the WOT book nine on my wish list. However, I have to agree with those who are becoming slightly restless. The intricacies of the plots and the large cast of characters of the WOT are fine -- the pace is not. RJ needs to speed things up.If you want to experience truly great writing with plots and characters as rich as Jordan's, but at a pace that never slackens, try George R. R. Martin's A Song of Fire and Ice series. This is true genius."
1,"Finish it, already!","Don't buy this book until Jordan finishes the series -- I have my suspicions that he never will.This series has degenerated into books, written a year or more apart, that detail a myriad of character plots, but do little to advance the major plot. Jordan has a cash cow here, and he's going to ride it as long as he can. I started reading this series many years ago, and by the time Winter's Heart came out, it took me several hundred pages before I was even close to up to speed again. And how much is really happening here. Not much. We keep meeting new people and being diverted by new character plots.Is Jordan stalling? Does he have no clue how to finish this series? At the rate he is going, he is going to die before book 47, the final in the series, can be written.Personally, if I was doing it over again, I'd wait until the series was done, then read them all back to back."
3,I like this one better than the last 3 books,"There are finally some movement this book!!! I understand the author may want to set up his plot lines and so on. However, I was so bored with the last 3 books that I groaned every time when the author introduce yet another side plot or clue. I think this book is the start of the ending. Although I hope the author to hurry up, I don't wish him to just cut the threads and let us hanging and unsatisfied. I agree with a previous customer reviewer that the author probably will need to write 2-3 books in order to complete all the threads and end this series well. I will be more disappointed if the author hurry through the ending and not doing a good job after he has dragged us through the last 3 books."
4,"Better,but not best.","Interesting to read the highly critical reviews written by readers of this very long, and at times ,tedious series. I agree that books 7 and eight have been merely ""getting there"" in their structure,but I think book eight,""Winters Heart"" has actually moved on quite alot. I noticed the stories about each of the main characters were longer,less changing the subject. Each had a suspenseful ending,and were much more complete. Good,Good. However,my complaint is the difficulty of remembering the characters names! Was this one good or bad ,were they a Darkfriend or Black Ajah ,or whatever. With the long downtime between books I wish the list of names in the index was more complete,so that very similar names could be recognised.Particularly the Aes Sedai,so many of them. All in all I feel Jordan is coming back on track,but however many books are their going to be!!"
2,It keeps going and going...,"With so many reviews I'm suprised that this book rated as high as it did. Jordan obviously gained many devoted fans with the first few books of the series, which were among the best I have ever read.The problem is that Jordan has introduced so many side characters, that 90% of recent books is taken up by useless dialog that does nothing to further the main plot. If it wasn't already taken, I would recommend that the series be renamed ""The Never Ending Story"".If you haven't yet started the series, read the first 6 or so books and wait for the last one, if it ever comes out. There's nothing in the more recent books but filler dialog."
2,Disappointed,"This book went no where. It took me 4 months to finish because I kept putting it down in favor of more interesting books(like my dish washer manual). If its content were edited to half the number pages and a small climax and partial conclusion were added, the book would have been much more enjoyable. I don't consider the encounter at the end a climax. It seems like it was just pasted in. I won't buy book 10 unless it's the conclusion, and that's only because I've invested so much time already."
3,"Better, at least","Like almost everyone else, I've been frustrated that the pace of the last few books has slowed to a crawl. Although, as another reviewer has noted, I'm not ready for the series to end yet, but I don't see the point of having the last two books contain hundreds of pages of filler leading up to the last few chapters, where the only real action happens.Winter's Heart is at least better than the last two books. I don't want to post any spoilers, but in this book, we have some long running plotlines finally being resolved. The ending, in particular, was quite satisfying - perhaps moreso than any other book in the series.Overall, although the book could have been much better, I enjoyed reading it. Hopefully it marks a turning point in the series, and that the next book will return to the quality of the earlier books."
3,Big time disappointment,"Ok, I read all of the other reviews and unlike most I didn't think the ending was up to par. After all, hasn't this been building for 9 books, and thousands of pages. And there's going to be a 10th book!! I was very let down by how unexciting Rand's cleansing of the Source was. Very ho hum. It was about as exciting as if he had just finished his chores, not something that will change the world forever! After finishing the book I kept saying but what about this???what about that??? All of the story lines that I wanted to know about were either left unfinished or barely mentioned. Why do I keep reading these books? First of all, I DO want to see how all of the storylines end. Second of all, I've committed so much time to this already that I can't bear not to finish all of the story."
3,Not bad but finish the series already,"Trilogies work because humans can not hold interest for too long on a single plotline or story. That is a fact. Short stories are wonderful because one can finish an entire story in one sitting. Also a fact. There is honestly no end in sight for this series and Jordan is not getting any younger. So sit back and wait another two years for the next installment of this -at least- decology. Maybe if he has a son, HE can finish it in less than twenty more books.Some stuff happens in this book at least. But not enough for the amount of pages it contains.If you are one who seeks closure in life do not read this series.Personally I hope the bad guys win just so I can stop hearing the characters whine and moan. Go Dark one go!!!"
3,600 Wasted pages,"RJ spends 600 pages to get us to the last 50. Then we have some serious action. He spends so much wasted time giving us minute details of people that mean very little.Why doesn't he give us more of what whe want? Action! My guess is that he want's to drag out this money maker forever. At this rate Rand will never get to face the dark one at the last battle.Some spots in the book are just great,the three women linking with Rand,but their is too much gravy and not enough meat."
1,Book 9 of The Wheel of Tedium,"How very sad to observe a gifted writer like Robert Jordan become trapped upon his own wheel..The Wheel of Tedium. The plot meanders, the pace is like marching through molasses. Characters are named and seemingly never heard from again. Questions raised books ago are never resolved and new questions are raised with little hope of resolution. I skimmed entire chapters at a time. Worst of all, Jordan no longer loves his characters. He's probably becoming as bored with them as we are.Robert, please...from a devoted fan whose been along from the beginning: do us all a favor, take what remaining new ideas you have left, bundle them together in a final book and end the saga. And if it's about the money, not to worry: just start the wheel turning again with book one of the next epoch."
1,what a stinkeroo,"I loved the first six books in this series. Books seven and eight were the beginning of a slow decline. This book was the worst. It was about 600 pages too long. If I could speak directly with Mr. Jordan I might be inclined to say something like,""Get to the point, fathead!"" The best advice I could give anyone thinking about reading this series is DON'T!"
3,How many books is this series supposed to have?,"I know that it's impossible to change someone's perspective on this once great series: either you love it, or you quit reading it several books ago (I once was in the first group, but now am in the latter). I'm writing this view for one reason: while whatever her name is continues to pull on her braid due to the ""complexity"" of men, George R. R. Martin's latest book came out in the Fire and Ice saga and I can only hold my head low in shame at what a gifted author he is. Ironic that there's a review by Jordan on the sleeve! While Paul Atreides, oh, I mean Rand battles evil and the Bene Geserit (oops, sorry, again with the incorrect reference) et. al. continue to spin their wheels I have been thoroughly enjoying Martin's work. If you haven't read this other series, put down Jordan now and do so. You can thank me later...."
1,He's lost the plot - because he never had one to begin with,"There's a very good reason why this series is wandering all over the countryside doing nothing in particular.This is from the mouth of Robert Jordan at a book signing a few years ago (when I was still reading the series - I've since stopped)""how many books there were going to be in the series?"" - 7 to 9 he says, not quite sure yet.""about the plot - do you have it worked out?"" - Making it up as I go.To put it simply. HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT HE WANTS TO DO WITH THE PLOT - HE HAS NO PARTICULAR ENDING IN MIND.So, if you have any illusions about Robert Jordan being a great writer who will safetly bring you home to a brilliant conclusion to this series - put them at rest, BECAUSE HE WON'T.Still it's been interesting reading how frustrated all his readers are - the question I have is - why are you still reading this if it is so bad?"
1,"read the last 50 pages, the rest is filler","Another miserable 650 pages to slog through in Mr. Jordan's Wheel of Time series. The first several in the series were good, but this is ridiculous. Not even the L. Ron Hubbard's (hope the Church of Scientology doesn't mind me using his name in vain) Battlefield Earth series was this painful, or this long.Seriously, this has to be longest series ever written to not have a conclusion, and yet promise one. His minor characters, and small plot twists spanning multiple volumes add nothing to the story. which are issued out every two years.It takes this long to write a book that has no major plot events, adds nothing noteworthy, and manages to skip through the admittedly interesting conclusion to get to the end in a length readers might stand?Ask yourself this, when the ending that you've read ~7000 pages (and running) to get to happens, will you look back and say ""oh, yeah, that added to the story?""Don't even bother with the first 32 chapters. Nothing happens."
4,Ouch!,"I love the series that's why I'm buying it. Those who hate it then don't buy it. I don't get the point of the people who criticize Mr. Jordan's WoT series. They are on a hard trail of campaigning to discredit and series and dissuade the fans from buying the book, when they themselves bought the 9th of the series. THE NINTH! Am I missing something here? I am a fan and I like to read what other fans think of the series and share some of my own. Constructive criticisms are healthy and very welcome. But please, this is THE NINTH of the series and you're still at it? If you hated it so much get off and forget about it. I, like the rest of my fellow fans continue to appreciate Mr. Jordan's WoT. Sure we have complains on some points that we wish to ventilate but it does not harm the talent of the author who is giving us our money's worth everytime we pick his book. Winter's Heart is another pleasurable read!"
4,"Patience is a virture, but. . . .","This book reminds me of the first 5 books of this series. Those books I could not put down until I was finished. This is less so in part because it is so difficult to keep all of the characters and subplots straight after leaving them behind for two years.If anything, I would ask Mr. Jordan to put a list of characters and where they fit into the plot in order to help out next time around. The glossary is not adequate.But, Rand is getting it together. Women are fighting less over stupid stuff and realizing that the world is in a precarious position.Tedious, yes, but truly, getting all of us to realize that the world is in a precarious position takes a lot of patience!"
4,Much better!,"I greatly enjoyed the last Wheel of Time. After the muddy indecidedness of books 7 and 8 some stuff actually happened, but the lack of attention paid to Tar Valon was quite annoying. The new chapter icons, return of Bayle Domon etc. were really cool however, and the series has finally resumed progress towards its end, though even so it can only be hoped that the series ends before Robert Jordan dies."
2,9 Books and ....to go,"10 years and 8 books ago, Robert Jordan got me hooked with good, solid writing (please note the term ""solid""), but may lose me with all the ""fluff"" and indirect writing that has appeared in books 4-9---wait I'm still reading them! It seems that I cannot stop reading this series due to all the time and energy I have invested in memorizing all the names and places, wondering when Nyneave will pull out all her hair, or if the Aes Sedia are actually Bene-Jeserits in disguise. I still see glimpses of the writing that got me hooked, but they are so few and far between, I find myself skipping paragraph after paragraph until I see something that cathces my eye. Word to the wise (that wouldn't be me)read the first three books and then wait until the last book in the series and then only read the last 100 pages of that book--it will give you more time to read the George Martin series."
2,How Many More?,"Yet another Wheel of Time book where nothing happens except one of the Forsaken getting killed in the end.How many more of these do we have to endure? Hey, Mr. Jordan, END IT!!"
3,Good but could do better,"After the last 2 books, I was really hoping that Jordan could put together things like his first 5 books. I was pleasantly surprised that Winter's Heart did do that to a certain extent. The storytelling is a lot more sharper and it appears that the series might finally proceed to some conclusion soon (atleast there is a hint of it). After having dragged us out like the ""Lost Ones"", Jordan finally comes up with a better book. Like many folks, I am hooked and will read the books as they come. But definitely, this book is something to look up to for anyone still interested in the series and were put off by the previous 2 books. He could still do better......."
2,Winters Heart,"The first 6 books are my favourite books, but the series has gone rapidly down hill. 7 and 8 were ok just very slow paced. But this book takes the biscuit. Nothing happens until the last 30 pages (out of 650) I kid you not.I will probably give Jordan one last chance ( being hooked on the series) but this book sucks bad due to the entire lack of action or plot."
4,The plot finally starts to move again.,"After the fifth title in this series came out, I figured it would take three more volumes to tie up all the loose ends. Now, after the ninth, it still looks like it will take three more volumes, at least. If you like complex intertwining plotlines, then this series is for you; if you like plots to be resolved, better look elsewhere. Don't by this one without reading the whole series in sequence.This volume nonetheless makes some significant advances towards a final resolution. Several events forshadowed since early volumes finally occur; so do some surprises that can't help but affect the final outcome. I won't spoil things by getting specific, but things move farther forward in this volume than in the previous three combined."
2,Another Disapointment,"For all the Jordan fans waiting for the series to finally get back on track...don't hold your breath. Jordan starts off with an utterly useless section about Perrin and continues with hundreds of pages about Elayne's political troubles. There is virtually no major advancement of the main plot until the very end of the novel. Remember what the main plot is? Don't feel bad if you forgot. It's been a long time since anything important has happened in Rand land. As for those who think this series is as good as Tolkien's 'Lord of the Ring', get real! On sheer imagination, Jordan's series is immense. However, it's too unfocused and divergent to be ever considered as good as Tolkien's."
3,Wait until he's finished,"Unless you've JUST started reading this series and have been kept abreast of all that's gone on, I'd honestly suggest doing what I'm going to do from now on: wait until the series is COMPLETELY finished. The book *is* better than the last couple (which, sadly, isn't saying too much), but I'd just suggest waiting until the series is over, then rereading the ones you've read and then the newest ones, so you won't have to wait the 2 years between each book! *sigh*"
4,Worth Reading,"Although Jordan does tend to spend too much time on the perpetually stagnant characters of Elayne and Perrin, there is a definate move towards the resolution of the series. Many things which had not been previously known are revealed in the book, and it also has new surprises. Definately worth reading if you have read the other books, and if you haven't, you should."
2,THE WHEEL OF TIME IS STILL FROZEN IN THIS WINTER'S HEART,"as an avid reader if the wheel of time series, i can't help but continue to be disappointed. where some questions were answered most were not. and can someone please tell me what is happening w/perrin and fail? this story line begins the book and then just disappears. also, did i miss something, or shouldn't winter be over? i could have sworn that was what the bowl of winds was for. as w/the last 3 books, i spent much of the time just skimming pages looking for something of real interest. it is no longer the series that enthralled me w/magic and monsters galore. now we are lucky to have rand channel to just to bring a pitcher of wine to himself or to see a grey man pop up. where has all the fun and action gone? i just want to get to the last battle and be done..."
2,Not worth it.,"I still don't know why this book has such a good rating...It was much worse than the 8th book yet people seem to like it more. I have to say, you really only need to read the last 100 pages or so if you are a WoT fan. The rest is junk. I don't criticize books very often. I understand that the author has to make a living. But sheesh...Jordan sure is making a living at the expense of those who have grown to love his series. Hopefully, he'll write some better stuff in the future..."
1,And in yet another installment....,"...our heroes spend 600 some odd pages waiting for the light to turn green so they can cross the street. Does anyone need to point out that Tolstoy wrote the entire War and Peace in about 1600 pages. Must we keep killing trees for this poor Tolkien rip-off. Poorly written, boring, goes on and on and at the end you're just waiting for the next part to see if it could possibly be more boring...and it is!!!!"
2,Like getting lost in a maze,"I loved the beginning of this series, so much so that I turned on 2 or 3 buddies onto it as well. Started out great, the plot lines, sub plots, deep characters and just a great read.But enough is enough. I find myself hoping a plague or magic will wipe out 3 sub plots as it is getting too confusing.There is such a great story underneath all of this, but when 4 main characters turn into 6, then 8, then 10, now 27...Crimanry, I have to re-read it before I'm done to keep on top of things. One of my friends started a outline of characters just to follow along and another had abandoned it all together.Simplify and find the heart of this series, it had such promise."
1,ridiculous,"I find it hard to believe that the last few books were written by the same author that wrote the first few. This series had more promise than any other fantasy series I have ever read. Robert Jordan got bogged down in his many plotlines and minor characters. Nothing happens. When you can skip whole chapters and pages of description, and pick up right where you left off, that's a bad thing.Some editor needs to slap the author and make him write again. Simply compare his writing style (descriptions, level of dialogue, advancement of plot, action) between the first 5 books and the last 4. He has begun writing simply for the act of writing, not for the reader. It shows, and it sucks.I would no longer reccommend even starting this series as it has become such a gigantic disappointment."
3,What the hell?,"Is Jordan now going to have 12 books in the series? Only two things really get resolved in the whole book. When I was reading this it felt like it was something that was rushed, almost like it was written by someone else. I am disapointed in this book. The rest of the series is wonderful, but this book seems to be the sequel that is terrible by itself, but you have to read it to finish the series. Lately the books in the WoT series have been getting much shorter, and I am wondering if Jordan will end up writing more than eleven books by the time this series raps up."
4,"Better than the last one, but not saying much","Well, anyone else getting worried that Mr. Jordan will die (god forbid) before this series ends! I can't imagine it ending in the next book... maybe in book 11 or 12 but not much before, so I'm getting worried that we'll never actually see the end... And of course Mr. Jordan is the first to say that he's not gonna tie up everything which leads me to believe their will be parallel novels when he does finish the bloody thing. And for those of you who complain and fuss, guess what, the supposed master, Tolkien, has as many flaws as Jordan, and to tell you the truth, every writer has flaws, PERIOD!"
2,Not again...,"After Crown of Swords I resolved not to buy anymore books in this series. Jordan's first few books in this series seemed to be going somewhere but then I realized he was just writing a soap opera: no plot, no action, no momentum; just endless scenes of pointless bickering, traveling, and whining, with a tiny bit of action thrown in at the end of each book.I decided that if the next one(Winter's Heart) was the LAST book in the series and he FINALLY wrapped it up I would buy the last two but low and behold I read the sleeve description that said: Rand continues his journey, Elaida continues, continues, continues... on and on it goes. That's it. I'm NEVER reading this series again!! Ten years is ridiculous."
1,read only if you want to grind your teeth in frustration!,"sections from the crown of swords to the crossroads of twilight, meaningful to the orginal story, can be contained in one single book! the rest is all about hair tugging, description of clothes, anotomy etc. robert jordan is probably dead - the publishers are milking it for all it is worth!"
2,OK at best,"I used to be a big fan of Robert Jordan. Then he started milking the series for all its worth. As one of my friends would say, ""After the 4th book in the series he started describing useless things. He would spend 4 or 5 pages describing some guy's horse and then you never hear about the guy or the horse ever again.""I do like Robert Jordan's style of writting. His characters are rich, vivid, and realistic. If you get sucked into the Wheel of Time books, then it is hard to not finish them. However, save yourself some time and money and don't get hooked."
4,Jordan has comeback!,Jordan has the knack to keep you anticipating the novels. I would rate the series higher if the publisher would publish the novels sooner rather than keeping us waiting for so long. This one is one of the better books (comparable to the first 2 or 3).
4,"The heart of ""Winter's Heart""","I had been waiting a long time for this book. I admit to being completely enthralled by the entire series and this book was not enought to satisfy my appetite for Jordan's creation. This new book did not have the character details that I feel have been bogging down the plot for the last two books. When you reach the ninth book in a series, it is safe to assume that most of those who will be reading have read enough of the other books to know what is happening and who is who. The book really pushed the pace of the plot throughout and I found it much more fulfilling than the last two. I didn't want the book to end."
3,Time to move on....,"I think the first three or so were pretty good. I got sucked in and kept reading, waiting, hoping for some closure. There does not appear to be any in sight. I've even forgotten some of the connections between characters. I discovered that I really don't care what happens to Rand anymore. I feel like the storyline is slowly grinding to a halt. I can't sit around and wait for ""The Wheel of Time"" Book XXVII, ""Sleep falls"".But there is hope! I was recommended the ""Sword of Truth"" novels by Terry Goodkind. Almost through the first one and it's awesome. Much faster pace and more action overall."
5,The best WOT book Jordan has turned out in awhile...,"The last few books in the series has been pretty unsatisfying, but Winter's Heart brings the WOT back, with gusto! Something finally happens, which is more than one can say for the others, and the ending makes logical sense with the rest of story, also a feature I'd missed. I hope this is a trend that keeps on going!"
2,Winters Heart,"Subpar book in the Series, But more importantly it appears that The WOT are no longer available on the KINDLE for USA Amazon Kindle Users and that is disappointing because I have been re-reading all WOT books on my Kindle Fire. I was actually going to buy Crossroads of Twilight on my kindle tonite. But unfortunately I cant do that because it is no longer available on the Kindle for USA Amazon users"
3,Much to think about,"With well over 300 reviews already this book has sparked a fair amount of praise and criticism. I found that there were a lot of things explained in this book that we had been wondering about before. I won't ruin anything for you (like others feel inclined to do).The pluses: We saw how Rand decides to deal with the taint on the source. We get back to Mat and he meets the daughter of the nine moons. We discover a lot more information about who, what, when, where, and whyThe minus: local politics and the Seanchan seemed to dominate a large portion of the book.I think that it would be great to head back in the direction of Trollocs, Myrrdhral, dark hounds, and Drakkhars. I have a good feeling that we are, but we have to be patient.Bottom line? If you've lasted this long, then you honestly care what happens to the plot and the characters. You won't be disappointed in what you find out, but just wishing that there was more there."
2,Finish it already!,"As the series drags on with so much build up towards a supposed end, I don't know how Jordan will ever finish without the final book being anti-climactic."
4,"Good book, and please stop with the spoilers","I've only read this particular book once, but I really enjoyed it. (And I'd appreciate it if folks would stop posting spoilers in their reviews. That's really pretty low.) The characters, as always, were well defined and seemed to flow very well. The plot moved at a reasonable pace, too. It was nice to see the three 'major' characters touched on, Rand, Mat, and Perrin. And although I don't particularly care for Faile as a character, the female leads were brought in at just the right moments.Looking forward to the next book(s)."
3,Nail shut on who's coffin?,"The last sentance in this book is in the 'About the Author' section. It states: ""He has been writing since 1977 and intends to continue until the nail shut his coffin.""I am wondering if they will nail my coffin shut before he finishes this series! To anyone who has read the series to this point, here's a tip; skip the first half, it will all be repeated either in the second half, or surely his next book!Personally, I'm done with WoT until the final book is published. Then I'll read them all over again, assumming I that I won't be so old that I can't read!"
2,"Fair, but not horrible","The most frustrating part of this book is its failure to advance one of the most critical plot points from Book 8: The Rebel Aes Sedai War against Tar Valon.Rand's and Mat's stories move forward nicely. The complication with Faile and Perrin, even while interesting, ultimately detracts from the flow of the story that has been established over the previous eight books.From reading this book, you don't get the feeling that the series is drawing to a conclusion, which after almost 7,000 pages is sorely needed for te sake of all our sanities."
3,When will it end?,"Give me a break, Robert Jordan. I have to say I'm losing patience with this series. The plot is not that complicated nor are the characters that interesting to require 10+ volumes! C'mon, Tolkien did it in three, speed it up will you?"
1,Put me out of my misery,"I sure hope RJ has written the ending for this series, because this really has become the never ending story. With so many characters it's easy for the author to take a diversion when the ""inspiration"" isn't there. The first few books in this series were quite remarkable, but it's become a chore to get through each successive tome. I think I've ordered my last hardcover, I'll just wait for the paperback to go on the discount rack."
2,not to happy,I just finished Winter's Heart and I have to say that aside from the end of the book I am not too impressed. It seems since A Crown of Swords Robert Jordan has developed a formula: short books with minimal plot development. There are so many storylines that he only addresses once every other book that it makes the waiting between installments seem like wasted time. I would prefer to wait a couple more years and get a big honking whopper of a novel instead of these 600 page snippits. I am beginning to lose faith...
2,What a shame,"There was a time when I was in love with the Wot series. Unfortunately, I have gradually fallen OUT of it. In my opinion, when reading a book starts to feel like studying for a history final.. it's time to put it down. What happened to this series? It reminds me of an aging horse. There's a time when you just have to put it out of it's misery. If only Rand would go insane and kill all of the females the book would improve dramatically. But honestly, what people claim is rich storytelling is actually a bunch of BORING RUBBISH. I read to enjoy myself, not to fall asleep 10 minutes after cracking the book. Am I the only one who SKIPS PAGES when the focus of the story turns to the women? If Jordan skips all the useless female chit-chat he can wrap this series up in two books EASY. I say have Rand kill EVERYBODY, then kill himself and be done with it!"
4,The Wheel turns a little faster,"I waited 2 1/2 years for this book, and it was worth it. Once more Robert Jordan has picked up the pace of action as several plot threads are resolved and the final battle between good and evil draws closer. Per usual, RJ juggles four plot lines in simultaneous time. I found 2 very interesting; one plot thread concerning Elayne was less interesting, but it had one very good and surprising scene. The plot line concerning Perrin was good, but too short--here RJ did not advance the plot enough. The great story lines concerned Mat and Rand--both are nearly as good as the best in the series.I rate this book in the top three or four of the 9 book series. Only The Dragon Reborn and The Shadow Rising are clearly better. Read it and enjoy."
2,Can we please get on with it...,"This series ground to an almost complete standstill 2 books ago, and this newest one is upholding that fine tradition. These 600+ page books seem to be written so as to draw this serious out as long as possible, dribbling just enough actual story at the end of each to rekindle your interest in the next one.I've lost any respect for Jordan as an author, this is shameless. Keep in mind that this series started over 10 years ago, it's actually LIKELY at this point that Jordan may die before finishing it. He'll have spent at least 13 years on it, making that just over 1/5 of the average human lifespan.(edit) Yep, he died before finishing it."
2,More of the same,"This book is better than PoD (that's why I gave WH two stars instead of one). The writing is technically good (not elegant, but solid) and the plot limps along, but at least it limps, which is more than I can say for PoD. Some plot lines, esp. the one handled at the end of the book, are closed in a rather lame way, but some people might like it. My advice: buy the book if you are a die-hard fan (but wait, if you're a diehard, you already have it), but if you're not a fanatic, wait for the paperback."
1,What happened to the Plot? the storyline ??,"Just lame : no progress in the plot, actually went backwards !!"
3,Finally Some Development.,"I've been reading Jordan like a madman this year to catch up to his tenth book. This is the third book in the series I've finished this year. Things finally start to move in the second half of the book and it finishes with a major series altering development. Jordan sometimes seems to have created too many characters and subplots for anyone, including himself, to keep track of. ""Heart of Winter"" starts with Perrin and his party, but gives way to Matt and Rand, leaving you to wonder about Perrin after his temporary disappearance. I suppose this keeps you waiting to see what happens to him and his wife, but it can get frustrating not to get a clue as you finish the book. However, I recomend that you stick it out if you've gone this far. This novel renews my faith in the Wheel of Time series."
3,Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time Series,"The first book was great. The second good. Now I'm just praying he'll finish in 10. A good read, but buyer beware, if you get hooked, you'll be waiting with the rest of us."
1,Jordan has set a new standard for boring,"Jordan unfortunately has sold out and it seems is only interested in the money. Another boring book that is tiresome reading, i'd say about the last 30 pages were worth reading. Whats next 700 pages on how the sea folk build ships. Someone e-mail me when the last book comes out, maybe in about 20 years. I'd ask for Jordan to e-mail me but I couldn't handle 600 pages of boring e-mail."
1,There are no endings to the Wheel of Time...,"It is hard to come away from reading this latest book in the WoT series and not give credit to the critics who charge that Mr. Jordan is only for the money at this point. In 600+ pages, no effort is made to progress the plot that has become very stale over the last few books. This latest book doesn't even have a complete sub-plot, rather it closes some sub-plots from previous books and starts new ones.I have come to expect more from Mr. Jordan and whether he only now cares for the money, has run out of ideas, or has taken to writing only while on weekend long benders the result is the same; a poor ending to a great start. I will buy the next book(s) just to finish it out, but they will be from the used book store and not pre-ordered at full price. At least then I will get my money's worth."
3,"Remind me again, where is this series heading?",Get the next one from the library or a friend...let someone else do the spending.
2,What Happened,"I am trying to remain faithful to the amazing story created in the first five books, but after the last few books in this series I'm unsure. The main plot is not advancing and main characters are not present, but you've got plenty of detail on not as interesting sub plots. I will buy the next book, but if it continues like the last two I may put the series to rest."
2,"Mr. Zipay, Puh-leese!","Some readers apparently confuse length with depth. An epic is defined by its content, not its length or complexity. Beowulf is an epic. So is the Song of Roland. So are the works of Tolkien and Herbert and MacCaffery. But they seemed to be able to tell their epics in a few thousand pages or less. Can any reader out there really say that he or she is following everything that's going on in WOT? I downloaded a glossary/cast of characters after three or four books from a WOT site that was 100 pages long! Jordan needs to tie off some loose ends, ignore others, focus on the three ta'averan and can the travelogue, architecture tour, and fashion show. At $25 a pop, I'm starting to think he is the Dark One!"
2,I have a vision...,"...of Robert Jordan in his writing study working on the next WoT book. The walls are covered in thousands of Post-it notes for every character name, plot, place, and thread in the weaving of a decade of writing, over 7,000 pages. Every once in a while a note coated in dust falls to the floor, only to be forgotten under a desk or stuck to RJ's shoe. Another character lost. No matter, there are plenty more where that one came from. New notes are created and pasted over others - insuring that pages on pages will be filled with detailed descriptions, names, and quirks of characters who have very little to do with what plot is hidden on the walls behind them.Stubs from publisher's advance checks litter the desk and floor as well. Characters stuck to the live ones get top billing in the next 1,000 pages."
2,"Quickly, while were still young!!","This series will never end. It goes on, and on, and on, and on...Opps! Now I'm doing it. The content is a continuing re-hash. What started out as an interesting series has been exploited by page stuffing, cut and paste authorship until the glow has been completely erradicated by this effort at milking extra dollars from loyal fans. Too bad, Robert Jordan once had me as a fan but this is too much...will it take 10, 12 or even 15 books before the publisher lets him out of this overdone dollar game he has been in? It reminds me of ""Friday the 13th - part 13"". If they bought the last one, let's sell the 10 more like it with a fresh coat of paint. Would someone please bring in Reader's Digest to condense this series down to 3 novels?"
3,a thought on the series as a whole,"i started the WOT series and devoured books 1,2 and 3. However RJ's lack of ability to move plotlines along grows ever more irritating. I know a million people have said the same thing, i guess this makes it a million and one. I want to like the books but the more progress you make into the series the more you realize RJ is just spewing nonsense. There must be 1600 pages devoted to CLOTHING styles in who-knows-where! THe series is more or less a pile of gold under a bigger pile of garbage. RJ is a genius author and his storyline and characters are unparalleled. However whenever i try to love the genius intricacies in plot and characters, i remember how the later books are: 50% clothing descriptions, 30% describing facial expressions, 5% braid tugging, 9% describing weaves of saidar,2% character development and 4% plot.Blood and bloody ashes!!!!"
1,what happened??,"Its still hard to believe how the Wheel of Time series that started as one of the most promising fantasy series ever has become what it is now, an endless annoying soap opera with hundreds of flat characters who dominate 90 per cent of the books. Winters Heart only continued that way downwards although the main plot line finally moved a little when Rand cleansed Saidin (on the last 10 of 7 or 8 hundred pages) but altogether the story became even more unbearable. I almost stopped reading this book when I came to the part where everybody suspected that Perrin had an affair with Berelain. Unfortunately I decided to continue reading it but I won't make the same mistake twice!!"
1,Interesting tid-bit for the fawning masses,"How many of you know that Jordan's editor at Tor happens to be his wife? Hmm, strange coincidence, eh? He's the cash cow for the company, so it's no surprise he keeps pumping out books in this series. Tor is letting him run wild, with no editorial control.Give him another editor who will force him to pare his books down by 100,000 words per book, at least.Otherwise, this book barely moves the story forward. I suggest folks read Martin, Kay, Sean Russell, Glen Cook or Robin Hobb for good fiction that has a beginning, middle and end."
2,Molasses Up Hill,"I am now on page 183 of this strong competitor for slow torture and absolutely NOTHING has happened. A majority of the main characters haven't even made an appearance as of yet. The entire 183 pages could be condensed into twenty without ANY loss in plot line. So does the other two-thirds of the book get any better? It does appear that criticisms of ""hair tugging"" seem to have taken effect, only to be replaced repeatedly with ""breath cold enough to see"" comments for every character thus far. Imperfect behavior modification? The series has come to standstill after the battle of Dumai Wells. Unfortunately, too much time and money have been invested not to see this through to the end."
2,Lets get to the point,"I found the book frustrating. I realised by the end that there will be no end to the series. The author seems to have researched his varied cultures very well, but I find he has stereotyped the women characters to one style, good or bad.Please end the series!"
3,Can he move the story along?,"I am about 500 pages into this book. And much like the last3 or 4 books in this series, the plot just barely moves ahead.I mean 200-300 pages of hair tugging, man hating women and woolheaded men is enough to make you yank a few strands.Also, now Jordan is either introducing new characters as if they are old ones, or they are old ones that havn't been in the story for so long, I don't remember them.Robert, end it already. I love your style of writing but pleasemove it along."
3,Not a fairytale,"I feel this book as well as this series catch a bad rap based simply on the scope of it all.Personally my only complaint is the time between publishing although even this is somewhat excusable when considering the magnitude of what RJ has undertaken.I would now like to take this oppurtunity to remind people that this is not a fairytale,you are not expected to like all the characters even the ""good guys"" have faults much like real life.Bad things do happen to good and bad alike,this story deserves better than to simply be wrapped up and tied off with a pretty little bow like some thoughtless hollywood movie.My advice is to revel in the length of this series as you will not find a better written more in depth set of novels in this genre.Finally I thoroughly enjoyed Winter's Heart and anxiously await the next installment after some admittedly slow going."
2,Paid by the word,"At least that is what is seems like in this 9th installment of the series. The ratio of pages worth reading to the pages of fluff has become completely inverted during the life of this series. If you buy this book, be prepared to skip lots of pages. You won't miss a thing."
2,Get on with it already........................,"This story has branched out so wide, Jordan doesn't even bother to address all the major plots in this, the ninth book of the series. The end of book 8 has Egwene transporting her army to depose Elaida while book 9 never even addresses what happens. I read at one point this series would consist of 10 books -- good luck. I figure at least 3 or 4 more just to straighten out the various conflicts/competitions and then probably a couple more to give a second by second description of the final battle. It's too bad that RJ seems to have slammed the brakes on this story development as the early books were very enjoyable. I will continue to purchase and read the new books as they become available but despair of finding out how it all turns out until I'm a grandparent (my son is 2 months old)!!"
4,Great addition,"First I must address some issues about Robert Jordan and The Wheel Of Time series in general. For one thing Robert Jordan is not focusing on minor characters the last few books, if you think about it during the last book Mat was recovering from injuries, now that would be exciting and relavent. Second his characters are very well defined and so is his entire world. The Wheel of Time is a very long series, but that makes it so much the better. In my opinion if you can write the worlds biggest conflict in less than 10 books it is not worth it. Now Winters Heart is just the latest addition to this wonderful series. Finnaly things are begining to come together. Now Rand finnaly makes some signifigant gains in his war against the Shadow. If you have read the previous books this is a must!"
2,Addicted--which is not a good thing.,"Yes, I am addicted to Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series. I need to know how the story ends, but unfortunately, Jordan's Wheel of Time books (aside from the first few) do not have conclusive endings. Winter's Heart is no more than a segment in a soap opera. This entire saga has rambled on too long. There are too many characters and subplots to keep track of. This is made worse when many characters and plots are not even visited from one book to the next. While Winter's Heart does provide some answers to the mysteries posed in previous books, the story in Winter's Heart could have been told in almost half the pages that were used. Do not buy this book if you have not read the previous eight books in the series. This one is only for the serious addicts, like myself."
3,Better than the last two but seems filled with artifice,"I was delighted when I read this book and found that a lot of questions that have been floating around for a long time were answered... But, I felt like they were answered just for the sake of being answered, and a lot of times, the answers were irrelevant and artificial-seeming. The book would have been so much better if the irrelevant revelations had been replaced with, say, the thoughts in Rand's head, and his reasoning, which lead up to the *SPOILER* cleansing of Saidin. That is, we hardly understand what is happening, which of course may be because Rand himself does not, but in that case I would like a little more insight into Rand's uncertainly, fears, etc. On the whole it feels like RJ has stopped story-telling, and is now using the books for an extended Q&A session with mystery-obsessed readers. Still, I have high hopes for the future, and of course I'll continue to read them."
2,The Neverending Story,"For anyone thinking of jumping in to the Jordan series, I'd recommend waiting until it finally ends before buying any of the books. I coughed up the cash for the first five, but this series has really died out in the last three books.Series as a whole: excellent take on the epic fantasy concept, but the basic limitations of the genre are truly taking their toll on this reader's interest.Nothing happened in this book. At all. I haven't bought the last three books, I just checked them out from the library. I wouldn't recommend the investment of time, much less cash on this book.I'll probably check the next one out of the library when it comes out, but if Jordan continues his trend of churning out mass quantities of pointless text, I might not make it all of the way through."
2,This series is on life support,Nothing happened in this book until the end and the ending was not really very intriguing......I am cutting my losses and bailing
1,Trees Sacrificed their lives&#65533;for this?,"If there is divine justice, the karma piling up from the loss of plant life due to rotten WOT books will inspire Robert Jordan to write a good sequel. In case he does not, I suggest printing Book ten with biodegradable ink, and pressing little seeds between the pages. This way, if the next book stinks as bad as this one, the reader can dig a hole, bury the book, and with luck...by the time WOT ends, have contributed back to the earth at least one tree to atone in some way for the needless slaughter of it's brethren."
2,"Please, God, make it stop. Just make it stop.","The first couple of books were decent formula fantasy potboilers -- nothing to write home about, but nicely imagined and certainly better than some I could name. At some point, though, it all has to end. There's simply no conceivable excuse for spinning out exactly the same exhausted plot elements, over and over, book after book, until the end of recorded time. This thing is longer than the Bible. It's longer than the Bible and The Lord of the Rings combined. It's longer than the Bible, The Lord of the Rings, and the Annotated Works of Stephen King, with a little Proust thrown in for desert. It's even longer than that, and NOTHING IS HAPPENING. The girls get into trouble. The girls get out of trouble. Rand is tormented. Rand kills a Forsaken. Over and over and over and over and over. Just END IT, Mr. Jordan. Please.On the other hand, of course, there is a lot more spanking here than one generally finds in epic fantasy. If you're into that kind of thing."
1,Disappointing,"An otherwise tolerable installment in Jordan's once-great Wheel of Time series has been ruined by exactly one character: Cadsuane. If you thought Jordan's women were annoying in previous books, you will probably despise Cadsuane. I was hoping that Rand would balefire her or at least show her how to treat the Dragon Reborn. Unfortunately, Rand, in a stunning (and, in my opinion, extremely out-of-character) move continues to accept her abuse. The other women in the book haven't changed from being annoying and ludicrously hypocritical, either. This trend throughout the series has always detracted from its epic atmosphere, and in Winter's Heart it is simply unbearable. I would love to finish the series, but I cannot bear to read such ""tainted"" books. I will always wonder what compelled the author to give the vast majority of the women in his books such characters."
3,Can we be saved?,"I have enjoyed the series up to about book eight and nine, His entourage has been great, but the series is lacking in the greatest reason people read the series in the first place, nothing is really happening. For this particular book the characters are getting to thin and far too many of them are seeing storytime. I think that having up to twenty characters infiltrate the scene is powerful, but it is bogging down the story. Truly only one important event has taken place, the cleansing of the male source, but nothing else except a setup of a multi-story cliffhanger that by the time the next novel ocmes out there will be little in my mind about the series remembered. Hopefully it won't take two years for the last novel to break page."
4,QUESTION,IS ROBERT JORDAN AND TERRRY GOODKIND THE SAME PERSON.THE WAY BOTH SERIES ARE WRITTEN IF NOT ONE IN THE SAMETHEN THEY GOT TO BE TWINS.
2,Would you please get a move on?!,"It is unfortunate that what had promised to be such a great series at the beginging has bogged down into a morass of niggling details that could easily be left to the imagination of the reader. I, for one, prefer to have something left for me to do with my brain beyond passive entertainment (or I'd be watching TV instead). I'm afraid that Mr. Jordan has stretched 6 books worth of plot into 9 books worth of pages in a distressingly Jean Auel (Clan of the Cavebear series) like manner. I appreciate the fact that complexity of plot is important but GET ON WITH IT!"
2,This book is only for hardcore fans,"Along with other fans of this series, I was anxiously awaiting the next installment. But all I can say is that I hope Mr. Jordan will slow down and take a bit more time before publishing the next book. This is a disjointed, dull effort with little plot, not at all on par wwith earlier, exciting novels. Characters who were developed at length in other books do not appear here. Most of this novel's characters -- and their often complicated backgrounds -- are never reintroduced. It is assumed that the reader understands the most casual of references to events that occurred in previous books. But only those who have thoroughly digested all eight other books have a prayer of understanding what is going on. I was very disappointed in this novel."
2,ummmm,"things can only get worse.....if your still reading these books, do yourself a favour and find a series that actually goes somewhere....starts off alright and ends in boredom"
1,Please finish the series,"I read the first book in the series and couldn't wait for the second, read that one two and then the third, fourth and fifth. I've read all nine so far, but quite frankly have become lost in the details. Some of the early books in the reviews ""eye of the world"" talk about a trilogy, then in another book its eight novels. Enough is Enough, I'm not investing anymore time or money until the last book is finished and Everyone is at home. Then I will start again at the beginning and read from book 1 to book 10 ( I HOPE)"
1,Ho Hum,If speed reading becomes a sport this is a great one to try it on. Unfortunately the only parts I found myself reading and enjoying were a few chapters smuggled here and there. There are chapters with Matt in them that caught my attention. Dont ask me who the other characters were. They fell by the wayside.
2,slow...few action sequences,"This is the first Wheel of Time book I attempted 2 read and it was overly-detailed and long. I liked the meeting though between the darkfriends and when Osan'gar sat laid on the hill, watching Rand. But now Im reading The Eye of The World. A hell of alot better than Winter's Heart. Its true then that the series does go downhill after the first six"
2,"""Winters Heart""","Like the last 3 books in his Wheel of Time series, ""Winter's Heart"" is pretty much a waste of good paper. There's no plot, little action, and little apparent effort by the author to do more than meet a publisher's deadline. What started out as a truly great example of fine story telling has become nothing more than an effort to make a buck.I would not recommend this book to anyone, nor will I waste another dollar on anything ""written"" by Robert Jordan. Like I said above, it appears that the author has worn out any interest in the story line which he so carefully created in the first four or five books in this series. It's on to better literature for this fantasy reader."
2,Disappointed Again,"As someone who has been reading this series since the first book was released, I have to say I was extremely dissappointed in this book. It used to be whenever the next Robert Jordan book was released, everything would stop for me until I finished reading it. With Winters Heart, I found myself struggling to get through most of it. In fact, I read several other books while trying to finish it. The first half of the book was extremely slow filled with what seemed like mundane details, focusing on events that just weren't very interesting. Not to mention the fact that I was having a hard time remembering what had happened in the previous books.I know I sound like I'm being disloyal, but I'm ready for the series to end. There are some cool things that that occur in the book, so if you can make it through the first half, you'll have some intersting reading. Hopefully the next book won't take as long or be as boring."
5,Winter's heart was the best book of jordan,"I really liked winter's heart, it was really great, a lily in the winter was fantastic. And for the ones who are complaning about the length of the series and about jordan losing controle of the story, meet him and you know that isn't true. I met him and he is so cool!bye a twelf year old:)"
3,Ha Ha Ha,"This is hillarious. I've given up on this series long ago, but I enjoy coming back again and again to read the reviews. Most complain about how wordy and stale the books are, but the hundreds of reviews always average out to a pretty good rating. Why should Jordan change anything? He is selling lots of book and obviously has a huge readership hooked. I feel for you people, but nothing is going to change. Accept it, or get over it. Good Luck"
1,You've got to be kidding...,"Let me begin by saying that this is the most effective teaching tool that I have ever encountered, with the likely exception of Crossroads of Twilight. If you want to teach students the effect of early success then burning out and milking the cow, this is *the* book for you (again, with the notable exception of CoT).Having somewhat mildly said what I really think, I will offer this suggestion: novel writers, like songwriters, really don't care whether you love or hate their work, they just don't want you to be indifferent. If you are indifferent, then the book/song won't get any attention at all (do people often write reviews about a mediocre book? No)and the next book won't see the light of day. That's what authors fear.When the wheels fall off, as they have in this series, then ignore it. That will get the author's attention."
2,Another long on words short on plot effort,"I'd like to start by stating that I'm a huge fan of Robert Jordan's previous books, but every book since # 6 feel like he is milking his readership and writing for the money rather than for the story. Literally 3 or 4 events occurred in this book - Nothing is happening in the series since book 6.Please Mr Jordan, give us a book like books 1 - 6 and let us know how the series ends. Some suggestions... Moiraine returns from limbo where she was sent (book ?), Lan unites the north behind Rand, Perrin unites old Manetheran, Matt is the general, they all meet to fight the Trollocs, etc., and Rand and company win. Rand writes a book entitled ""From there and back again"" and sails off with the Seachan. The end. Please, please, finish this up versus making me read through endless details of no value to the series. The last few books have felt like reading the phone book. These books aren't cheap and you are close to loosing me."
1,Winter's Heart,"My God!... If I have to hear about Nyneave tugging her braid and smoothing her skirts for another 1000 pages I'm going to scream. This book was the worst yet. How can Mr. Jordan waste that much time and never get anywhere? I am hopelessly caught in a never ending loop of useless description of charactors and what they are wearing. Why does Mr. Jordan spend so much time describing what someone is wearing and then only devote a couple of pages of a very long book to any real action? Of 766 pages, only the last two chapters did anything to advance the story. I got caught into what I thought was going to be a very good series and have now been left feeling I have wasted my time. I am just glad I never wasted my money on the hardbacks. I will be waiting patiently for my turn at the next grueling book(at the library!!). Mr. Jordan PLEASE finish this!..."
2,What's with the clothes?,"I think many other reviewers have said it well...the series had promise but as it goes on, too much is happening (plot lines aplenty) and too little is happening (none of the plot lines go anywhere). I have only one thing to add: has anyone else noticed that Robert Jordan seems to be obsessed with clothing? Pages and pages devoted to descriptions of what everyone is wearing. I can't keep track of who anyone is anymore, but by gum I know what they all are wearing in excruciating detail. Perhaps Robert Jordan should consider writing for Cosmo."
2,How To Waste Your Time . . .,"Have read all of RJ's books and really wished I had waited to read the reviews of WH. Way too many characters, and plots that require access to a database just to keep informed. And yes, I agree that action is not a requirement for a great book, but action is usually required to tie up all of the 1012 loose ends that are still dangling after this book. Count me out for future editions, I will read the reviews that are written in less than a 1000 words and will chalk up the last four books as written by someone barren of inspiration and clouded by greed."
1,get on with it,"too longtoo obscureI wonder if Jordan is still writing these books?The style has changed, he repeats himself endlessly to fill pages, and nothing ever happens."
1,Wrong product sent,"I ordered the 9th book in the Wheel of Time series by Robert Jordan in unabridged CD format. I paid immediately, but was sent the cassette version, which I have no way to play. I listen to these books as I drive, and I do not have a cassette player in my truck. I suppose I could go out and buy a portable cassetee player and drive all day using earphones, but that seems a lot of trouble and expense, especially after the seller advertised that he was offering the CD version. I am very dissapointed with this purchase. I have subsequently purchased the CD version from another seller. But now I am stuck with a book on cassette for which I have no use."
5,Robert Jordan is a God,"So many people say that Jordan's writing is too wordy and to involved. That's the idea. You can't paint a picture without descriptive imagery, and that's what he does. Winter Hearts was a great ninth book that leads readers to want more. For anyone who loves fantasy, and anyone who has read Jordan before, they'll love Winter Hearts plot and intricacies."
3,Heading Downhill in a Large Spiral,I must say that I had high expectations for this book. I was expecting a large detailed book with a great storyline and the beginnings of a resolution. I don't know whether this is the first half of a book nine (Part 1??) however it appears to me that Mr. Jordan is spending more time on his Conan series books than this series these days. The last few books have been shorter and left out a great deal. Do your fans a favor and start focusing again and return the series to its place it should be. At the top.
5,good book,Number 9 in the WOT I was not let down it caught my intrest very much and when I went on to read the online reviews for it I found a bunch of people chritisizing this book and for u people who havn't read it yet don't listen to them. THere just a bunch of idiot's who wouldn't no good literature if it bumped them on the head.They complain that there's to much description and that his character's are to complex and that nothing happens. Well there wrong. There is a lot of description but it makes the book interesting. I agree that in some parts I do get bored but in what book do you not?So take it from me this is a good book and don't let people's bad reviews get in the way.
2,"A little bit better, but not much","I have been an avid Jordan fan for a while, but recently, I have been getting more and more impatient. There is only so much a normal human being can read without going crazy over the lack of action. At least this book actually has more action and less politics! Of course, only Rand and Nynaeve actually do anything, but thats okay. Its and improovement over the Path of Daggers, which was possibly the worst of the series(with the possible exception of the Crown of Swords). The beggining was so great, lets try to end this thing in the next 2000 pages okay?"
1,MIND NUMBING BOREDOM!,"I have read the other books in this series and I have to agree with other reviewers. The first four books were fantastic and I counted myself fortunate that I found them after all were printed. I have been waiting for Winter's Heart for a long time and needless to say, I am very disappointed. It feels like Robert Jordan is simply shuffling through drudgery in the attempts to satisfy publishers. This book is REALLY hard to read. Not for difficulty, but for sheer boredom. The women in this book are irritating and mindless. The CONSTANT references to sniffing, snorting, pulling of braids, blah blah blah. Come up with some new descriptions. Also the fact that ALL the women are so full of themselves it makes you want to throw the book in the trash just to escape them. Bottom line: Save you money. The Wheel of Time has finally stopped turning."
1,Boring and far too long,"This series started off as a great story and was comparable to the best. But Jordan seems to be more concerned with filling pages with meaningless descriptive paragraphs, and introducing more and more charactors. Now it does not compare with the shorter excellent works of other fantasy writers like Gemmell or Eddings nor the Dragon lance series, all these leave you with a wish for more, Jordans books now leave you with an ""I'll be glad when its finished"" feelng"
1,I wish i didn't want to know how it will all end.,"i loved the first half dozen books of this series as much as the rest of you. but we've reached the point now where it is just painful to continue. i don't want to give anything away about book nine, but here's a hint. NOTHING HAPPENS! remember how awful book 8 was but you were trapped by the exciting ending and forced to look forward to book 9? well, you're going to have to wait another 2 years, because the battle was never discussed. didn't happen yet. that's right. 650 pages worth of two days where NOTHING HAPPENS. you want the cliff note version? read the the book summary. i swear. everything is in there. even the ending. had i just read that, i could have saved 8 hours of agony. the sad thing is that i'm going to read book ten. but i'll be damned if i spend a dime on it. i beg all of you to take it out of the library like me."
2,Becomming Stale,"Unlike other people, I prefer to read when travelling rather than work. I find that you can engross yourself in the novel and time flies.Robert Jordan has the ability to be one of the great writers, but has unfortunately lost his way.The Wheel series started off with an excellent entrance and I sincerely believe he intended this to be a trilogy. Commercialism rears its ugly head and he has seen a long term money making machine. He has run out of ideas and the plot drags on. The entire last four books could have been condensed into one without loosing any of the plot.Mr. Jordan, please bring an end to this series and take time off to reflect on a new series that does not take years to finalize. Only the masters such as James Clavel and Frank Herbert had the ability to become better with each book."
1,Gak... the agony continues....,Next book - we get from the library (if at all) rather than send Jordan and the book co more $...
4,"Not the best in the series, but better than the last two","I'll make this short and sweet.What to expect with book nine? A bit more action than the last few, and a resolution (perhaps) of a few major story lines. Apart from that, there were several hundred pages of political maneuvering and character development. Not that those are necessarily bad things...Yes, the story moves slowly, but that is what happens in an epic of this scale. Yes, sometimes story lines get ignored for an entire book, but other story lines get developed. My biggest criticism is the use of convenient plot devices that have not been mentioned in the past eight books, but make their appearance here for the first time. But I digress.Have you been reading the series? Well, you will enjoy this volume more than the last few. Are you new to the epic? Start at book one (Eye of the World), and enjoy. But be warned - the epic isn't finished, and won't be for some time."
1,This is it. My last book of the wheel of time,"I am fed up with it. I started reading the series just few months ago and I went through the first 8 books in a flash. Since book 6 the story began being boring but I stick with it. This book does it. There is no way of following the plot. Probably I am stupid but I don't remember all the 10,000 names there are and stories keep intersecting in a way that you don't even remember what you're reading. Were the hell is Faile? And what did Elayne accomplish? Is the Dragon Reborn mad or not. Stop with those side wounds I am sick of it. It's since book one. This story is never going to end. DEAR MR. JORDAN EVEN THE BEST STORIES HAVE AN END AND THIS IS NOT THE BEST ANYMORE."
4,Finally! Something happens,"Robert Jordan suffers from the NES complex (Never-Ending Series). Finally, something of note happens in this book, though not until the very end. Oh, and Mat shows up too.Whew.One message to Mr. Jordan: NO MORE CHARACTERS! At this rate, we'll need an encyclopedia to keep track of all the plot threads."
2,I give up,"That's it! I can't stands it no more.I used to think that this was one of the best fantasy series in a long time, it sure started that way. Length may be the problem now. It's taking a long, long time between books and I get the feeling he's dragging the story out to milk more money out of us for his retirement. Bob, you're already rich, get on with the series.This could have easily been wrapped up in a dekology if he had desired to do so a few books ago. I love the world and characters, but have gotten so tired of the random injects of side characters and sub-plots. Every scene and action seems drawn out, and I guess padded is the right word. I can't keep it all straight anymore and don't really care to.Never thought I'd say this around book 5, but I'm done."
5,Old School,"After my utter disappointment with Robert Jordan's last addition to The Wheel of Time books, Path of Daggers, this books renewed my faith in the series. Many fans dislike the complexity of a series so long and drawn out. Howevern I view the length as a testament to Jordan's magnificent ability to create an entire world that includes (as worlds do) more than just a few three people, after all who can tell history through the changes that only three or six people have made. No, true history is a collection people with a few leading, creating, or simply a the focus of the change. Winter Heart returns with the non-stop action and completion of prophecy that was evident in the first books but lost in the last. Jordan has again captured my sole attention for receation literature! Buy it and you won't be disappointed!"
4,Path of Daggers,"What a discouraging reviews. Back here in the Philippines, we haven't got our copy of the 9th book. But however much the (professional) reviewers rate Mr. Jordan's WoT series, I still am waiting with anticipation the arrival of the next installment. For me, his work on WoT is one of the most enjoyable books available on shelves right now. Luckily, i read the book for my own pleasure and not for the sake of other people's literary dissection. There are some merits on the pacing observation, and I agree with the other guy when he said that the completion may come out in 2040. But the way I look at it, that's another 40 yrs. of enjoyable reading."
3,An addition to my call to arms...,"I forgot to mention...anyone looking for an excellent realistic fantasy series based more on true medieval history (with excellent editing, no filler, and great storytelling) should check out A Song of Ice and Fire by George R.R. Martin. Book one is titled A Game of Thrones (up to three books now; all three excellent) but be warned: this series is not for the squeamish or faint of heart; medieval life was not pretty. Please support authors who put out quality work and care about the reader's satisfaction, not authors who produce shoddy work and only care about the size of their wallets."
4,Don't be impatient!,"All of you who wish the series was over, don't you realize that a story this big does need a lot of time to finish? True, the books could be a bit more condensed, but even if it has slowed down since The Fires of Heaven, it's still the same epic story and all it needs is some time to wind up to a satisfying conclusion. So don't be impatient - stick with it. Though I do wish a few of the books after Winter's Heart were out as well."
4,the greatest series that never ended,"first, let me say i like this series. I do. really. the problem is that Jordan dispite all his good points never resolves one thing! sometime while reading this series i feel like im watchin a soap opera? when i first started this series about four years ago a figured definatley no more than ten book max, probably less but at thi point it looks like the series could go on for another nine or more. in this most recent installment there was some closure at the end, the taint was finally removed. hopefully in the next book a few more things will get resolved hell maybe will even find out who killed asmoden who died several books ago. I certainly wish rand would take care of bussiness, he jumps around too much he needs to consolidate his power. establish a firm grip on the 'empire of the dragon' so to speak and deffinatly get more involved in the black tower.all in all it is good it just never ends. hope this helped a little."
2,Take a writing class.,"I don't think the fact that this series has reached nine books gives the author or publisher any mandate to allow the writing style to go to hell. I know five-year-olds that can write with more clarity. When I took my one writing class in college, I got reamed by my teacher to forcing metaphors in where they didn't belong. I think that Jordan is the king of stupid comparisons. The book is frustratingly packed with ""medieval cliche,"" terribly slow, and not worthy of the acclaim that the first eight books might have received. I got to page 300, and realized that only maybe one or two things had actually happened so far. I could have written this entire series in 600 pages."
1,Jordan is more driven by money than passion,"I have never felt the need to publicly critize someone, untill now. Jordan may be a good writer but none of us can hide forever what we really are. Somewhere between book 3 and now Mr. Jordan decided that by dragging on this story he could milk more cash out of it. It is truly sad, not because I will not read this series any more, but because Mr Jordan no longer has my respect as a writer."
3,"Love the details, but this has got to move forward!","I have shared the Jordan series with new readers for years and I love the complexity, but the story is not moving forward enough even within these THICK books. Nice to touch upon Mat and Perrin, but so... What of the White Tower and Egwene? I will be sad when the series is completed, but I hope it is within my lifetime!"
2,10 years...Will Jordan live to finish the series,The Wheel of Time started off as one of the best series i'd ever read. The last three including this one have been really poor. And I'm a fan. Jordan's really struggling now but seeing as i've given it 10 years I'll hang about for the last two or three. Tell you what even with Mat coming back in this one its still poor. The next book cannot get any worse!! Maybe Jordan needs to read one of the Malazan Books of The Fallen for a bit of inspiration.
3,Had potential,"Winter's Heart is book number nine in the Wheel of Time series by Robert Jordan. The story starts slow as the first part of the book concentrates on Elayne and Perrin. I like Perrin, but his story doesn't move much here. Things pick up with the return of Mat, whom we didn't see in the last book. Rand's thread is slow for most of the book until we get the climactic scene . This had the potential to be the most riveting scene since Dumai's Wells at the end of Lord of Chaos, but it was unfortunately not as great as it should have been and failed to improve an otherwise lackluster book."
2,Save the World Already,"When the series first started, it was great and wonderful. I was amused at the attention to details and the not so subtle jabs at other fantasy series. However, it is the 9th book already and it feels like it. It's great and wonderful that Rand's three loves are bonded to him but I am finding all of the ""extra information"" slowing and I am finding it somewhat trite. I remember inhaling the earlier books in only a couple of days. The thrill left me after having a building drop on Matt and having to wait a whole book to find out what happened to him. I might fall in love with the series in the future but right now I am looking at other books in my digital library."
4,Good book in this series,I enjoy this series and unlike the previous book there is a lot of action and everything flows well. If you are a Jordan fan this will be an enjoyable book.
3,SLOW,"definitely the slowest book in the series, nothing happens. yes mat is back after fans demanded him more coverage in the series after bring excluded from the least book but to this extent is extreme. he just sits and does nothing the whole book. I'm not sure why this book is ranked higher than crossroads of twilight or knife of dreams"
2,Treading water,"Blood and bloody ashes, 766 pages of treading water! Mr. Jordan needs to get an editor (perhaps a life). It is somewhat mind boggling that this volume received such high praise by the majority of reviewers. Note to newbies to Wheel of Time: You can skip this volume without missing much of substance and hope that Jordan actually writes something worth reading next time."
4,Common now,"Jordan has proven himself as master of his work. The last few book of his have been slow but anybody worth half of their brain would recognize that Jordan is building the story up and setting up for Tarmon Gai'don. If you can't sit through it and soak everything up the 3rd or 4th time you read it, this story is not for you. Me, i love it"
3,Muddled Motivations,"Like books 7 and 8, book 9 is not up to the standards set in books 1-6. Motivations for actions appear muddled; people feel more like cardboard than like living, breathing characters. Not a stinker of a book, just disappointing."
3,Argh...just finish it all ready...,"Last June, I stumbled upon one of the best books I have ever read. After The Eye of the World, I devoured the rest of the series. Unfortunately, the series started getting worse and worse after The Dragon Reborn. Finally, Winter's Heart was released, and I was hoping for some kind of retribution for the terrible writing that I endured because I enjoy the series. I found that, but only with one part. Yes! Rand FINALLY cleansed the male half of the One Power, but that's the only thing that happened. Nothing else. Perrin is still looking for Faile, Elayne is still trying to be a queen and Egwene...well, what happened to her? Mat's bit was interesting as well, but it took him long enough to figure out who the daughter of the nine moons was. Please, Mr. Jordan, either end the series while you still have some dignity or start making the story move again."
2,"Wheel of Time? Gee, that sounds familiar....","I loved the Wheel of Time series and I started reading them years ago. However, it's been so long since the last book came out that I've lost track of everything. It's gotten so convoluted, that I feel I have to reread the whole series again just to refresh myself with what has happened. I'm sure Jordan still spins a good tale, but this reader has a life and can't wait years and years for the next unfinished chapter. Because that's what the story has become-unfinished and only the most die hard fans can keep up. I'm afraid the rest of our attention spans are not quite blessed with such fortitude. Maybe I'll return once the series is wrapped up and and I can enjoy a good story, but until then I've already moved on."
4,True Fans,"I can't believe all of the complaining from fans about this book. If you went back and actually took the time to re-read the reast of the series - you would realize all of the nuances and events that are occuring instead of being bored due to ignorance. Admittedly, the books due take QUITE a while to be published between each other, however, that is all the more reason to re-read since you forget so much! Jordan has built such a real, elaborate world that it would be cheating us to skip over minor characters since that attention to detail is what made us love them in the first place. Any who are bored with this book are not true fans and should just go back to reading their quick-action, no-think-required stories and leave the intellectually-pleasing, challenging world of Jordan to those of us that have the tools to appreciate it. (oh, and they should DEFITNITELY quit all their whining as well!)"
2,"""better than Book 7/8"" <> ""good""","Yes, Jordan/Tor is milking us... can you blame him when he can put a hardcover on the bestseller list?For those of you defending him... marvelously detailed worlds do not make good writing. Encyclopaedia Britannica is detailed but is not a compelling read. The only reason this book was better than the previous two was the action in the last 50 pages. So I paid for fifty pages of action and 600+ pages of dull plotting between Windfinder/Aes Sedai/Andor factions that just aren't that central to the plot?Please, take your hard-earned dollar and go buy George R.R. Martin, a writer who can take a detailed world and make it sing. I promise you after reading Game of Thrones et. al. that you will have a greater appreciation for what fine writing can be.... something missing from Wheel of Time since the 6th book if not earlier."
2,"Please, kill me now.","This would have been a good book, five books ago. I appreciate complex plot developments. I appreciate fully-fleshed out deep characters. I appreciate grand scale and scope in a series, but for the love of G-d, we are nine books deep and there is no end in sight!Even L. Ron Hubbard could wrap up a series faster than this.Complaining aside, it is a good series and we have been well and truly hooked. If there was something more to this book than the last 60-100 pages, it would have rated higher."
4,"Good, but not enough to buy the hardback next time..","It's much better than the last two books, this one at least keeps your attention, and keeps the pages turning. Hopefully, Jordan can finish this with as much impact as he started..Mat Cauthon's sexual adventures are quite humorous. He's everybody's favorite tramp, and should occupy a signifigant portion of each book along with Rand, ElayneEgweneMinAviendhaNynaeve(they should only get one portion together, it's boring), and various Forsaken and Darkfriends. Two very intriguing characters that don't get enough attention are Cadsuane and Lan.. I think both need a real battle so we can measure the strength of each against the other heroes in the book. This looks like it may be a 15 book series ,if Jordan lives to be 120!! A mediocre Jordan is still in the top 5% of all fantasy, but save your hardback cash for the top 1%, maybe Jordan will get back to that level with the next book."
4,Another good installment of a great series...,"It may be that this series is only for the really hardcore fan, but happily I am one of those rare few who started reading this series ten years ago and still wait nervously for each new book.If you don't have a lot of time or read very slowly this series isn't for you, but if you enjoy long sweeping world shattering epics ""The Wheel of Time"" has few equals when taken as a whole.And if you cant handle a rather lengthy wait for the next book I suggest you wait untill the series is completed before you start reading it as most of the major complaints seem to be over how long it people have invested themseves in this series without getting the payoff."
2,Winter's Heart is boring,"I have to preface this review with the information that I ordered Winter's Heart and a Storm of Swords by George R.R. Martin at the same time and read the Storm of Swords first. Storm of Swords was a great read and Winter's Heart just couldn't compare to it. So I may be more critical than I would have been if I had just read Winter's Heart.Winter's Heart is boring. Well at least, large sections of it are. The first six hundred pages could have been edited down to two hundred pages without losing one bit of important information. The last fity pages could have been expanded to two hundred pages with the timeline advancing a bit more and this book could have been a good, maybe even great book. As it is, I'm just hanging on to this series by my fingertips. The next one in the series is not on my ""have to have"" list."
3,What?????,I have mixed feelings about this book. I thought that RJ cleared up a lot of loose ends in this book but that it seemed lacking in content. He left a lot of the characters out of this book. It was really short compared to the other books that started the series. He focused on Perrin for the first couple of chapters and then there was nothing about him in rest of the book. He barely had anything in there about the White Tower issues either. It felt like everything that had happened in the previous couple of books was totally ignored in this book. I can't wait for his next book but I hope that it is longer and more indepth then this one.
2,Winter's Heart,The book is ok. SOMETHING finally happens. But Mr. Jordan's seemingly endless colthing discriptions may do him well in getting a job at Vogue but after nine books it's getting a bit old. Have you all noticed that the tpye is getting larger and the space between the lines seems to be expanding? Good tactics - less writing means more money faster. If you want more book for your bucks read George R.R. Martin. His is a tale you can sink your teeth into.
4,Many plot lines resolved,"Those who have faithfully read the Wheel of Time series will enjoy the plot resolutions of Rand fighting the Black Tower rebels, the mystery of Taim and Demandred, the revelation of the Daughter of Nine Moons, Rand's multiple romances, Mat's romance with Queen Tylin, and the use of the figurine sa'angreals.There are further developments in Perrin's character as he meets the Queen of Ghealdan and seeks to rescue Faile. Mat gets into another amazing scrape, and causes incredible side effects as he extricates himself.There is a climatic battle scene involving most of the Forsaken but NOT Rand al'Thor. That's a nice twist.There are some slow chapters, particularly with Perrin, but fewer than in Path of Daggers. This book is at least as good as Crown of Swords, and I think it is better, tighter, than Fires of Heaven."
1,Quick Read,"I started reading this book word by word.....Then just read the first line of each paragraph and then the first line of each page. I never missed a thing. There is no story..there is nothing but description after description of unimportant events, thoughts and environment. Over and over again and again. I got the book at the library....Why anyone would spend money on this nonsense is beyond me. Books like this should be condensed from over 600 pages to less than 100. Then it might be interesting reading. On a scale of 1 to 5 I give this a zero."
1,How much longer will this go on?,I thought this series of books was slated to end at number eight. It's too bad that it didn't really. I gave up reading them after the 5th installment and haven't regretted it. It's been so long since I read one that I became curious and picked up a copy from the library. Thank goodness I didn't pay money for this snoozer! I gave up on this series and urge you to do the same.
2,when will it end?,"I hate to beat a dead horse but Jordan needs to finish this series soon! I know some will say that creating a tapestry this large requires many books but please, more than 9?! Unlike some Jordan fans, I do not have time to re-read previous books just to remember who someone is...and I don't mean the obvious main characters. Some of the names are so similar that I don't remember if the character is a Darkfriend, a Wavemistress, or a Aes Sedai. This is extremely frustrating. Get this book at a library or skim it as I did to catch the major events."
3,Not as bad as it's been.,"Like the below reviewers I too wonder why I read this series, perhaps like the others it's simply wanting to see how my investment of time will ultimately pay off.The last few books have been laughable, with the trademark Jordan 'women are tyrants' characters, next to no plot development and, of course, Rand's tired self-loathing (didn't see this better with the Covenant series?).But I didn't hate this one.Why? Maybe it was a bit sleeker. Maybe the women seemed a bit more like human beings, maybe there was the hint of resolution. But I actually enjoyed the reading of it.Jordan's sin, if one can call it that, is that as the genre's most popular face, he draws attention away from more deserving authors like, of course, George Martin. But so be it."
3,Its out of control,Robert Jordan has lost control of this series after Lord of Chaos (the sixth book)books 7 and 8 were very bad Book 9 seems to be an attempt to get back control . But Jordan needs to get atleast some of the sub plots to a logical conclusion and get on with the main story. The main problem is that there are too many sub plots which do not get closed. I got nothing against sub plots but they should get over in two books or so. Carrying them on and on dilutes focus from the main plots. Further the new books come with more sub plots and when the old ones are not closed it just becomes too much. Best thing about this book is that Mat resurfaces
2,Will it never end?,"I'm a long time fan of ""epic"" fantasy. However, Robert Jordan is trying even my patience. The first 4 or 5 books of this series were some of the best I've ever read. In my honest opinion, Jordan has writing skills in the top 10 of this genre. However, having said that, I'm extremely displeased with the progress of this series over the last 2 books. Characters and situations are left hanging from book to book. Mat was entirely left out of book 8, and Perrin only touched on in this one. I can't even keep track of the Aes Sedai anymore. Their names and previous deeds all begin to mix together as I wait the two years for the next book.I hope the snail's pace at which this series is progressing picks up soon, or I will seriously consider abandoning the remainder of the series."
3,Getting too long...,"The first half of the book was pretty tedious as lots and lots of characters, sub-plots and sub-sub-plots have to be accounted for. The 3 women-and-Rand angle is getting ridiculous and annoyingly soap opera-ish. The story and pace gets much better when Mat reappears and the last 1/3 of the book almost makes it all worthwhile. Having started this series, I still want to see how it ends and will thus read the next book. However, if you haven't started the series, don't."
4,Keep on plugging away,"My girlfriend bought this book for me for my birthday last year and I decided to re-read the entire series so that I could refresh everything in my mind before I read the most current installment.In the course of the re-read I found myself getting just as excited in the first 5 or 6 books and then found the myself using that earlier momentum to plow through the last ones.The series is truly excellent, the characters well defined with an amazing backstory but the end is long in coming. I enjoy the secondary plots that Jordan introduces but following these ancillary plotlines does not leave a lot of time to move forward the main characters, even in an 800 page book.I'm in for the long haul and when the end does come I'll still think it was time well spent."
2,Emergency Liposuction...stat,"Would someone please edit this book! After wading through chapter after boring chapter of wasted paper you get a little action at the end. Would someone remind Robert Jordan of the old adage ""short sweet and to the point"". This series started out wonderfully, but has grown into a bloated behemoth. I skipped whole chapters and missed nothing. Take a razor and cut out every other chapter except the final one, you will not miss anything important."
1,Fantasy Filibuster,"Jordan took about 10 pages worth of plot and turned it into a few hundred pages of agonizingly slow descriptions of attire and addition of yet more characters that I could care less about. I actually dropped the book upon finishing it, and said ""That's it, I'm done with this series."""
4,Don't stop!,"It might just be that I've only spent the last five years reading this series as opposed to others who started reading when the first book came out, but i'm at the point where i don't want the series to end. I personally am enjoying the rich world and 500 story lines - still. I struggled through Book 5 but ever since then I have devoured each book, and continue to want more. I'm pretty sure that if you haven't enjoyed the last few books, you won't be enjoying the next 3 (Jordan has said that it will take at least 3 more to finish it). Stop looking for an end and start enjoying the world again! The reason the first 4 books were so exciting for all of you is because Jordan brings a new world and cultures to life. Now you're used to them but I still enjoy my little trips into this strange land."
1,Don't get too excited over this book . . . .,". . . . The worst is yet to come.I was actually impressed that something significant happens at the end of this book. I won't spoil it, but I would like to in order to save you the time and money. Besides the last chapter or so, NOTHING happens in this book. And if you are stoked about this Event happening at the end, do not, I repeat, DO NOT read the tenth book. You think that the plot is really going to pick up in the next book, but it does not. I thought it would, so after I finished the ninth book, I waited eagerly for Ten and I am still traumatized from the utter disappointment. So save yourself from the pain by not reading this book and especially not the tenth book.If you want something interesting and really funny, read the customer reviews--I mean bashings--for Crossroads of Twilight. You get a summary of this book and the next all for free told a hundred times better than Robert Jordan ever could."
2,The downward spiral continues,"Busy with a project of my own I have finally found time to catch up on the WOT series. Unfortunately RJ has continued to add subplots with out closing out some of the existing ones. In short, WOT has become infested with too many major and minor characters running around doing their own thing. One of the more aggrevating additions RJ has made is the insertion budding technology into WOT in the form of steam engines, gunpowder, etc. It basically detracts from the main storyline and everytime I run across it I skip ahead. Winter's Heart does not move the story ahead much."
1,Winter's Heart,"What is wrong with Mr. Jordan? Did someone else write his last two books?What happened to the fast paced, heart pounding stories from the first 6 or so books? I made up my mind that if this book stunk, then I was not going to finish the series. Well, the book stunk!"
2,Dragging on,"The operative word for this book, along with the previous few and apparently the next one is... FINALLY. As in: when is Egwene FINALLY going to get to the White Tower to (hopefully) consolidate her power? And FINALLY Elayne lays claim to the throne of Andor, only to be beseiged by multiple plots and problems. Does any main character in this epic ever just DO anything? Obviously NOT, everything is extremely complicated with gobs of details, most of which should have been left out to move the plot along. Jordan should learn from the movie makers who have taken this art to new highs (or lows: DUNE, 2 hours, come on now).Thankfully, Jordon does include one significant event at the end of the book. That being, of course the cleansing of Saidin.I've got a great idea, in the future we can take the significant parts from books 6-10 and combine them into one smaller book. It will make Jordon look like the literary genius he was supposed to be after he wrote the first few of this series."
2,"Descriptions, no action","As the series has progressed, Jordan has grown more and more fond of his own flowery descriptive style, at the expense of story and action. I frankly do not care to know the color of the piping on everyone's coat, or to live and relive sceens from various character's points of view! In this book, we visit every group of characters...and none of them move! Literally, except for Rand (and retineu), they are in the same place at the end that they started at the begining! Maybe the story has grown too complex, but frankly I should get half my money back because I didn't read every other paragraph."
3,Improvement - but that isn't saying much.,"Was Robert Jordan beaten by his mother? What else could possibly explain his treatment of women in these books? While the level of detail is impressive there is a lot of stuff that is just plain irrelevant. He could cut 5 pages by putting a little note at the start of the book saying that, unless otherwise noted, when Nynaeve is mentioned she is tugging her braid."
2,Tsk tsk name callers,"Just because some of us are disenchanted with these books is no reason to insult folks.WOT was a fabulous story, WAS, IMHO it as become bogged down by it's negative sterotype behavior of the characters.I was re-reading all the books before I got to book 9 so it isn't from a lack of memory that I say this as some reviewers would assume.I've read a lot of multiple book series and the one thing that always turns me off from a book is when the main charaters become so unsympathetic that I want the bad guys to win. That is where this series is headed at this point. I only hope RJ pulls it out of that rut by book 10 or I may never read his stuff again!That is my humble opinion. If you still like it, I am happy for you, but don't tell me I have no right to disagree with you."
1,Wait for the next book - this one's the pits,"Talk about a wordy waste of paper. RJ has contracted Stephen King Syndrome - make 3 pages of babble where 1 paragraph of literature would do. Seriously, the plot slows down even more than before. There is more plot movement in any 2 chapters of the first 3 books than in this entire volume. RJ must be paid by the word and Tor is trying to make this series go on forever. Don't get me wrong, I like the story, but it could have been done in 4 books, and done well. But Jordan/Tor have decided to milk this out and make it a lifetime project. Don't waste your money buying this book now - wait for the next book and buy THIS book at the used book store for 99 cents. If you don't die of old age waiting first."
3,The Fun is Gone,"This is a better book than at least the previous two...but it's not that good. He has too many plots going on which hardly get addressed, and are never resolved in one book, often not even two. He has finally resolved some issues here, which is nice, and he finally brings Mat back, which is better, but now Egwene is MIA. I used to be a big fan of the series but it has now become more like a chore to read the books than a joy. He could still use some editing help, as his writing style is still somewhat bloated and awkward. If you still enjoy the series then you should like this book, but if you are hoping for the book which will re-kindle your love of the series.....this one isn't it either."
1,Lowering my rating...,"After confirming that Jordan's wife has become his editor (which I have suspected from the last several books), I am lowering my rating of this book to one star. No wonder Jordan writes such stereotypical ""tough"" (arms crossed, hair pulling) female characters, and such meek men; he doesn't want to ... off his wife! And what a poor editor she is: I have never read a book with so much fluff and as many spelling/grammatical errors. Word to the wise: avoid buying these books until Jordan gets a better editor (perhaps the one he had from the first several books), and pick up George R.R. Martin's Game of Thrones instead!"
3,Could have been better.,"Although wonderfully written the most important events of the book could have taken 100 pages. Leaving 500+ pages for other events.Some parts were predictable. Like the Mat and Egeanin part. He needs a Blood and sul'dam and there they are.The chosen/forsaken are weaklings in this book. In the end of the book there are a lot of them wanting to put an end to Rand. They can do nothing. A bunch of Aes Sedai and Ashaman can hold of the most powerfull channellers of the world and make them flee? Very disappointing.I also expected the battle of Tar Valon in the beginning of the book. This will have to wait untill book 10/11/12 or 13?I would like to read something about Shara and the Seanchan homelands in the future.You can wait for the cheaper softcover. It was a nice book, but not much better than the previous two.I am waiting for book 10 ""Less Boring For The Reader"""
5,"Very Good, Took a while to go through","A good book like all the WoT Series, Very interesting about the Taint as well as the sea folk, it has a great story and what he's trying to accomplish is fascinating, can't wait till I can read the next book."
3,Trudging through the snow,"The artwork on the cover of this book couldn't be more appropriate. I would love to say that Jordan picks up speed here, but the pedestrian pace of recent volumes in the series continues. Numerous subplots still await resolution (some barely advance at all), while still new characters and subplots hit the scene. One begins to wonder if Jordan is creating a literary Frankenstein here--how will he be able to control what he has made? On a positive note, I will say that the ending of this book is vintage Jordan and is actually one of my favorite scenes from the entire series. That still doesn't redeem the book to a higher rating, but I offer this as encouragement as you wade through this one. Fellow WoT fans, you have to read this one, just make sure you bring your snow boots."
4,Finally the series picks up the pace it lost after book 6,"I'm a huge fan of Jordan, regardless of the waste of time the first halves of books 7 and 8 were. This book is a breath of fresh air - not only does it finally move the plot along in a direction that makes it look like Jordan might actually complete the series in book 10 (Believe me, if it goes to book 11, I will be fast on my way to losing RJ fandom state), but this book is actually well written! Some of the things that we've been waiting for are finally starting to happen (unfortunately, not all of them, so lets hope book 10 remedies that in 2003...) I won't say more, but the book is good. It's NOT like books 7 and 8."
4,low budget horror,"Pretty good collection of low budget horror but if you're looking for great special effects or great story plots,this is not the collection you want to have.It does have some gruesome scenes in them and some of them have some good horror humor.Worth $10.00 just to get some violent bloody scenes and a few good laughs.James."
1,crap,why are stores selling this and stealing my money sernairo like patrick from spungebob gee why don't i make a movie da even elvia is showing better movie some movies that are old and newer are being sold for 5.00 if i bought a candy bar on sale for .50 and it was bad i'd return it telling but your selling on line i can't return that easy i'm trusting you and amazon
2,Great Album Marred By Ending,"Typically hysterical stand-up gets marred by novelty songs at the end. He begins the bit(s) at the end of the album by talking about how he's being pressured to release a novelty song to promote, but ends up spending way too much time with his take on them, including a full length song at the end. The crowd eats it up, but as per irony, that's the point - but it never should have been put on the album. Absolutely worth the purchase price for the first two-thirds of the album, though."
3,Angry but at times predictable,"Schimmel is funny, but not as loaded with ""classic"" lines that you instantly memorize - you find these in superb Denis Leary's acts.Sometimes it feels that he could go easier on four-letter words; excessive usage lessens the effect and blunts the sharp edge. This is a shame.The title track - cheerful, silly and hilarious - is probably the highlight. I catch myself humming it every now and then."
2,Potentially great but disappointing,"I love a good biography, especially those of musicians. I love all of Dave Grohl's creations esp. the Foo Fighters. I was really looking forward to learn more about the man. Unfortunately this book doesn't focus much on Dave but rather on the Punk music scene and a who's who of punk music. I didn't need a whole chapter on Cobain either. Who's bio is this anyway? The book does have some really good pictures, just not much personal info on the man. I grew bored and didn't even bother to finish it, which is rare for me. Not recommended."
2,Okay To Rent. Bad To Buy.,"I rented this game recently and it had awesome graphics and ok gameplay, but the loading was horrible. Everything on that game had to load. Even the loading screen had to load.Tricks were really cool on the game...if you could do them. Most of the time you would hit the wave at the wrong point and crash or pull out.I would consider this game an okay game to rent, but pointless to buy."
1,Looks pretty but...,Control is absolutely horrible. I do surf and have for 15+ years. The control on this game makes it worthless in my opinion....
2,Ehhhh! COULD BE SO MUCH BETTER,"Well here we are..H30!1 YEAH wait um, how the.?. why?oops (wipe out) That is what you will be saying when you play thisgame. Then after about 30 minutes you will throw your controller down and curse Sony for putting out a game like this . I (a surfer) was all excited to see this game come out, but was very dissapointed the controls are just hmmm hwo to say this nicely STUPID. THe bottom lineis save your money. Hopefully they will put a game out that is easierto control. the graphics are cool, and the idea of the game is great,but the ... controls just are horrible. Rent it first see what you think."
3,A Good Rental,"I borrowed this game from my friend for a few days, and at first, it is pretty hard, it takes a lot of getting used to. But don't listen to what everyone else says, this game doesn't take an hour to master, it takes more like 20 minutes to a half hour. The graphics aren't that great and the contol scheme is pretty akward. But once you get the hang of it, it is pretty fun. The other problem is that this game is really short, I beat it within the three days I had it for. But it is a good rental game, it will keep entertained for the short period of time you have it for. I would not reccomend buying this game, unless you are a huge surfing fanatic, a three or five day rental is much better. But I found this game a lot better than everyone said it was."
1,...,"since when do you press up on the analog stick to go right and down to go left. The controls are very bad its hard to do a trick and you really can't play with someone who never played, unless you spend over an hour teaching them how to play also the game is short. I really don't have anything good to say about this game ..."
1,horrible,this is truley one of the worst games i have ever played. i'm in the ocean almost everyday and i was very excited to see this game come out. but its ohrrible. most of the time you just surf a wave (really just a blue slope) collecting floating orbes for points. .... this game is very very bad
3,Not Horrible,"Ill be honest the only reason I bought it is becuase it was on sale... The physics are nice and the controls arent as bad as everyone says. The only thing that (makes me mad) is there is no practice mode, so you have to play tournament mode and only get 3 falls before you have to wait for it to load again...I would say the game is good for about a month... :)"
2,kind of boring!,"i have only played this game once, but i really wanted to try a surfing game ... there is not much out there, i'd rather waste my time playing cod or halo ."
1,I OWN THIS GAME,I own this game i bought it at the Circut City in Vestal NY i got it and i thought it was gonna rock and be one of the best games out there i had to choose between surfing h3o and ssx snowboarding i now regret getting surfing h30 on top of that i didnt even get the surfboard to put on your dualshock 2 analog controller.
1,Not cool. 10 year old gamer from Charlotte.,This game is so bbbbbbbbbad. Who ever likes this game is messed up in the head.I spent $30.00 on it. Which was 30.00$ to much.
1,I just had a gut feeling...,"When i went to the store i had no intention of buying thisgame. However, surrounded by ... games i found this game for ... I figured if it is priced ... less it can't be great but hey, i like surfing it cant be that bad, can it? Well yes, it can. Surfing H30 just plain ... The game is hard to master, and has horrible controls. WHy would you have to press the R3 button down to stand up? They don't take advantage of the PS2 control which can handle more than the anolog and R buttons. Also, the camera angles are horrible. Whenever you turn the angle switches, i almost ... my food let alone my money. This game is made by an ameteur company who has no right producing a game at this point. Get some more experience before you try and come out with an enticing ps2 game. Bottom line if you see this game with a bargain price tag, pretend it just isn't there."
1,Atari was fresh,"I bought this game without renting it first, oops! this game should be recalled it is so weak. If you like surfing you will love to take this game and pee on it. I didnt get the little surfboard either, that was 70% of the reason that I bought the game. Everybody, write rockstar an email telling them to send me 49.99 in the mail."
1,Is this a joke?,"I beat this game in 1 hour, that's how easy it is. I can't wait to return it and get some money because it was a Xmas present. I would have never paid good money for this s**t!"
1,Surfing? More Like Death........,This game was the worst game ever.... I'am like a proffesional surfer and this is just terrible.... DO NOT BUY IT.... I REPEAT DO NOT BUY IT
1,I cant take it anymore!!!,"This game is SO bad, i would rather watch cheese grow mold. I mean, seriously, the waves look like blocks of ice. I've never seen anything so pathetic. Every time i play it, i usually end up throwing the controller and screaming at the top of my lungs. Sometimes i smack my head against the wall. The controlls are SO HARD that i usually get a big blister on my thumb. Yeah, gross, i know right? Well, you want it to happen to you? You wanna be smackin your big air head against the wall? You want goo spillin out your big fat thumb? If you do, go ahead and buy this game. Have fun in the hospital."
1,I was Lucky - I got my Money Back,"I think this is the worst PS2 Game out there. When I returned it to the store (Wal-Mart) they said NO returns after the package was opened but when I told them how BAB it was they understood and said I could have any other PS2 game of my choice. Surfing H3O is very hard to play, graphics suck. there is a lot better games to spend your money on. I wouldn't play this game if it was FREE."
1,bad game,"This game is weird. it has ok wave graphics, and terrible human graphics. it has pitiful controls. it is hard to master but one you do, its way too easy. i would not buy on any day unless you want a... bad game."
1,This Book is Worthless!,I think I was cheated out of my money. I hate it. The spells will not work. I hate it. I also think I paid too much. Did I forget to mention I hated it!P.S. I only gave it one star because I had to! I loath this book
3,Shoot me!,This one was very Marlon Brando; the brother shoots his sister's lover because he suspects the lover is abusing his sister. Strange plots twists.
4,An entertaining whodunit with a great sense of humor,"A witty romp with two heroes having very different approaches to life and investigating. Lots of references to 90's media and political characters, which will either date this book in a few decades or make it a nostalgic favorite. Some untypical (possibly unrealistic) actions from cops and mobsters, but who am I to quibble? The wrapup is a little slow, but overall, it's delightful reading. The alternating first person usage is done very skillfully."
5,Worked well,This product works very well with me. I would still prefer degree products but for the price this does the job well.
3,"It smelled nice and performed great, but it ...","It smelled nice and performed great, but it goes on wet and stays wet for a good amount of time. It also seems to be used up a lot faster than the solids. I personally wouldn't recommend it because of the discomfort of feeling wet for one to two hours afterward."
2,Rice Krispies,"On his Greatest Hits, I was expecting to get a clean CD of songs that were taken from the original masters or reel-to-reels, but the first 9 songs were recorded off of vinyl.I gave this CD 2 Stars because you can hear all of the snap, crackle, and pops that expect to hear on old records. If this might be a concern of yours, then buyer(s) beware..."
4,Old Skool,"I have MC Shy D's first OG on cassette. In the shower, I still bump his muzik and re-live the old skool lyrics I grew up to when I was a kid. I'm now 24 and still enjoy listening to it as much as I did back then; even more now cuz I can appreciate the muzik and dig what it is he's rappin' about."
5,Packed Full Of Hits,"I've been looking for this cd for years. I talked to SHY D(Peter)a couple of years ago and asked him to come out with a greatest hits album. At the time he wasn't planning on it, but i'm glad he listened and finaly released this album of old school Bass hits even though it's still hard to find. Thank you Shy!"
1,DREADFUL,I'm trying to award this ZERO stars but am forced to give it one.CAREFUL - most of the reviews here are for the 1994 Broadway revival - which give high marks. THIS MP3 recording is for the 2008/9 London revival. The London recording is DREADFUL - Truly AWFUL. Carousel in a cockney accent and badly sung. Give this one a miss. Try any of the others you find here instead.In fact this is so badly misrepresented by Amazon by using the wrong reviews I'm going to ask for my money back.-----------------------------------------------------------------Amazon duly issued a refund within a day of my request and agreed the wrong reviews are linked to this album. They are working on correcting the links! If you arrived here from the link on the Broadway Cast Revival CD page - this is not the MP3 album you are looking for. At least on July 3rd 2010.
3,Not Great,"Michael Hayden is really the weak link here. Everyone else is pretty fantastic. Unfortunately, Billy Bigelow happens to be the lead of the show. His voice gets whiny and thin as he has to sing higher -- it's especially noticeable on ""Soliloquy."" Other reviewers have mentioned that he puts character first, and this makes up for his weak singing. To that, I say that this is not a play -- it's a musical. The music is the most important thing, and Hayden is really amateurish."
3,Buy the 1993 London Cast Recording,"""Carousel"" is the great American musical. Hands down, neither Rodgers and Hammerstein nor any other composer has surpassed this work.While I am a huge fan of the Nicholas Hytner ""Carousel,"" I have to agree with Arne Andersen that this recording misses the mark. The casting is poor, the performances are weak and the numbers just don't have the dramatic impact they have on the London recording made a year earlier.As a huge fan of R&H; and of American musical theatre, I must urge you not to purchase this disc. I only bought it to have a recording of ""Give It to 'Em Good, Carrie."" It's not worth spending (money) just for that."
1,Worst Thing I've Ever Heard.,I thought this was a joke when I first listened to it. It is SO BAD! The guy playing Billy can't sing at all. They have someone else come in and play him for Soliloquy and thank god they do because the rest of the time you want to poke your ear drums out. DON'T BUY THIS unless you just want to listen to Soliloquy over and over again.
3,"Good, but not great","The playing is very good. But, the music itself leaves something to be desired. The pieces lack variety, and after listening to a few many amongst us would be able to see the same tonal structures appearing over and over again.I think the music of Weiss (recorded by Robert Barto on Naxos) is a far better example of well played and truly well written lute music."
4,I really liked the deodorant. Nice consistency and ...,"I really liked the deodorant. Nice consistency and it was comfortable to """"wear"""". I would definitely recommend it. The only thing I would change is the top of the dispenser. The openings are a little too big, making it somewhat hard to dispense just the right amount of deodorant. I ended up getting way too much out the first couple of times I used it."
4,I liked the scent of this product and ...,I liked the scent of this product and it wasn't too sticky either. I prefer this over a solid stick. I would recommend this product to others.
4,The product performed as expected. It kept me ...,"The product performed as expected. It kept me fresh and clean all day! No sticky residue, easy roll-on application. The scent was a wonderful feminine, yet clean, scent. It was also hypoallergenic, which was a big plus in my book! I would definitely recommend it to friends, family, and even neighbors! I'm sure I'll be purchasing more of this item since the price is great too!"
5,region 0,"unbelieable the fact that it's only region 1!!!!!!!!!!!! we only can enjoy cyndi in at last dvd? what about making a region 2 or 0 for europe? and the other past tours of cyndi, lost in the past forever? what a shame rain on me..."
5,Interesting sound choice,"The sound quality on this DVD is not just good, it's almost too good. What Cyndi Lauper and her team seem to have chosen is to record each of the instruments at the live performance directly, then studio mixed the sound so that there's never a vocal fallout of a screechingly loud horn moment or whatever. The sound is beautifully modulated, so much so that it sounds too good to be live, if that makes sense.At first, I must admit I was taken aback by it in a not-so-positive way. Then a few songs in I got used to it. By the end it almost seemed innovative. Every artist mixes their studio albums for perfect balance, so why not do the same for a live recording?When you watch a live concert on video you have a certain expectation about the sound quality. This DVD will definitely surpass your expectation. Whether that's a good thing or not is up to you."
4,Recommened reading for city slickers,"A superb book! Lots of information about people and how they lived in the Wild West. The illustrations and photos are very good, they brings the persons alive and makes them real."
4,Very attractive and functional,"We use this to convert a small dining table for bridge use, and it works very well. Color is very attractive."
4,Good table cover for cards,"I'm am very pleased with this table cover. We play quite a bit of bridge and other card games, so it gets well used. It doesn't slip around, and washes well. I would recommend this. I also bought the 36-42"" round cover, and also like it. Though it is not cloth, it feels like leather when playing on it."
1,Try again,"This and any other aquariums with the same design fail to tell customers that for a fish to be healthy, the tank it's in has to have a wide surface area. What's wide about a 3 inch by 20 inch surface area?The fish also have no room to turn around. Most fish will grow larger than the few inches this tank allows.You can't fit a siphon in it, which means you can't remove the poop from the tank, which means the built-up ammonia will kill your fish in a short amount of time."
2,enCHANTING but....,"I absolutely loved the chanting BUT when the applause came at the end the mood was shattered I ENDED UP GIVING IT AWAY. There are a whole lot of better chant cd's out there. Try ""Laude Mea Dominus"" or ""Laudes Consortium Vocale"" GREAT and NO CLAPPING."
5,"Terrific book,",I really enjoyed this book and think that most people who read it will agree. Nice Job!
1,Deceiving,"The title ""Mahogany Sheet 1/16 x 3 x 24(15)"" leads you to believe you will receive (15) 1/16"" planks. Instead you will receive one very small wooden sheet, wrapped many times in paper and many more times in plastic in the middle of a million packing peanuts, all within a enormous cardboard box. What a waste."
4,great performance,I don't think that there are any other similar performance which can compare with it.
3,Average,Average game. Nothing speacial. Very fun for fans; not so much for not fans. Now all we need is an Angel game(i sure hope so)
2,This game blows,I love Buffy but I hate this game. It is a little hard to control at times and is generally uninteresting. Oh well.
3,Relaxing Music,This CD is perfect background music to listen to when you want to relax and destress. It's also a favorite of mine for background music at parties...at the beginning of the night. You'll enjoy his twist on old standards.
2,What happened?,"THe magic is gone. After reading the liner notes, I learned that someone at the studio asked Previn to make an album of just ballads. BIG MISTAKE. I think he was not in the mood."
4,Useful Contribution,"This book does provide a useful review of the Source evidence from Roman writers, and, from a military perspective, draws a rather more convincing narrative than that generally trotted out. In particular, the suggestion that Verulamium was sacked before London makes good sense, and a much more convincing location is found for Suetonius' final victory than the west midlands one generally advanced.I'm sure some commentators will pick on some dubious passages, and the overall style, to dismiss this book, and one fears that the key arguments will probably be ignored until presented by someone eminent.Overall it is a useful contribution to the debate, and should be given serious consideration alongside the other books on the subject."
3,not the book I wanted,"Disappointed by the end of the second chapter, I sent this book back to Amazon. The writing style reminded me of that of a freshman year college student trying to stretch her measly research to fill out a ten page paper using the sort of logic that is generally limited to those newly entering the world of academia. (To wit, I have a fact: it could mean one thing, it could mean another. Or perhaps a third.)The premise of the book is an excellent one: a sort of verbal archaeological exploration of ancient events. Instead, it read as if the author discovered he lacked the sources to make that exploration, but decided to go ahead with the project rather than attack differently or scrap it altogether."
3,I've never used waxes so I can't compare ...,"I've never used waxes so I can't compare this to hot wax, etc. Personally, I prefer shaving. By the time I prepped my legs, waxed, and used the oil, I could've shaved both legs. It hurt, but not too badly, though I did say """"OW"""" with each pull. Worked pretty well on the hair between my brows without any pain. I'd recommend it for facial hair, but I think shaving leg and underarm hair is less painful and quicker."
3,This product is good and has easy to ...,"This product is good and has easy to follow instructions people can really follow. But the product doesn't contain enough strips. There were only eight. So basically the product will be gone after two uses, unlike other Nair products, such as the 15-minute microwaveable warm wax. It has so many strips that one can use it for at least 4 times -- or more. But overall, the product has a good presentation and it's effective."
2,I had high hopes for the Nair Cold ...,"I had high hopes for the Nair Cold Wax strips. Unfortunately, my hopes were dashed once I tried it. It was messy, ineffective, and literally a pain. I have used other Nair products with great success, so this is, hopefully, a rare occurrence."
4,FINALLY!,A deodorant that actually WORKS! I've been looking for an unscented anti-antiperspirant for a while - my body does not do well with the perfume stuff - so I was elated to have found it here. It has no scent but it keeps me dry & fresh ALL day.
3,needs a little work,"This puzzle would have been a lot better if the puzzle maker had thought like a child instead of an adult. My son is quite content to put the oval piece into the rectangular cutout, and it fits without any difficulty, although this is clearly not what the designer had in mind--nor does it help my son learn to match shapes, merely sizes. The same is true for several of the other shapes, as well."
5,Superb!,"I bought this puzzle for my son's first birthday. I was impressed with the bright colors and the large knobs. Perfect for little hands. Each shape is plainly labeled, which will be a good teaching tool when he's a little older. I also liked that beneath each shape, there is a picture of something that is that shape. Like a football beneath the oval piece, or a slice of pizza beneath the triangle. Being only a year old, my son is just barely aware of what a puzzle is all about. He's more interesting in chewing on the knobs and banging the puzzle pieces together. But it still holds his attention, which is definitely saying something. It's so well-made and durable, I'm sure it will last forever, even with all the abuse it endures. This puzzle is worth every penny!"
2,too expensive,this puzzle costs entirely too much for what it offers. you can get the same quality puzzle for $15.00 less at a local store. It held my 2 year old's attention for about 5 minutes and that was it. B-O-R-I-N-G.
4,Multi-Educational Shape Sorter,"I purchased this shape sorter for my 14 month old. At the time he mostly enjoyed watching me work on it as I described the colors and shapes, and now at 16 months old I honestly have to say this is by far one of his favorite shape sorters. It isn't something that he will spend the whole day on, but I have noticed that he is now trying to do it himself. I love this toy because it teaches colors along with shapes, and there are pictures under each shape to help with the relation aspect. I think it's a shape sorter every household should have primarily because of it's simplicity and it's tiny hand friendly nobs. My son and I work on it together once or twice a day every day and I can tell that has appreciated it more and more as he has grown. I give this toy 2 thumbs up!"
4,"Excellent puzzle, but who lives in a pentagon house?","This is a great puzzle, it's very durable, the handles are big and great for little hands. My daughter loves to take the pieces out and bang them together like cymbals. Under each shape is a picture of something of that shape, you know stop sign under the octagon, etc. However, there is a house under the pentagon and it drives me nuts - whose house is pentagon shaped!?!!?"
3,Pass The Chutzpah,"Some of the stuff in here is very, very funny and thought-provoking but, as is the case with much comedy, the real element of greatness is in the delivery, in the actual performing of the thing. It's swell for students of the man, for those already acquainted with him and his work, but definitely not a place to start. Unless you read it out loud. Like a genius."
1,I am still waiting for the book,"where is the book? the book has not come, i am waiting for the book, this is not what i thought would happen"
1,NO STARS,"First, the adhesive/velcro fasteners which attach this cover to the stroller were inadequate to say the least. Second, it is opaque, so the kids couldn't even take in their surroundings. Since it resembles a parachute, the only reason that the kids even got fresh air was because the *stupid* thing wouldn't stay attached to the stroller, the kids probably wouldn't have had fresh air. Go for hats and sunscreen/protective garments instead!"
4,A delightful overview of the history of writing and printing,"This book got me started with calligraphy in my early teens. It's an easy to read overview of the history of writing and printing--the most recent edition touches on the very beginning of computer-driven typography.The author's love of the subject matter shines through; Mr. Ogg was a fine calligrapher and did the examples of the various hands in the text. In this era of grunge typography, which runs neck and neck with the Victorian era in the race for the title of Cloaca Maxima of type, Mr. Ogg's delight in the simple and elegant is a jewel to be shared. If you know a young person of an artistic bent, by all means get him or her a copy of this book!"
4,"Good, but not as good as their other albums IMHO...","Sorry, you all can cream in your jeans over this record all you want, but their other albums where guitarist Bruce Stuckey was the lead singer (EVERY album after this one, in fact!) I've always liked more: ""Kill By Remote Control"" (2nd LP), ""Bullets For You"" (4th LP), ""Dedication 1979-1988"" (5th LP) (which is NOT a ""greatest hits"" compilation as some people have said!), and the import only ""Anything For Money"" (6th LP) (which IS available on CD unlike the others!) are all superior albums IMHO. Toxic Reasons are my favorite punk band of all time... I should know : )"
4,tasty stuff,"Not only is this a danged good disc, but I actually found it - brand new - at that store that sells everything for 99 cents ( can't say the name here) - along with D.O.A.'s ""War on 45 "" cassette.... whaaa??Anyhow, I had these guys on a few comps in the early 80's but never had this album. The album has a rough-edged approach which, if it were to be released these days, would be labelled ""streetpunk"" - akin to what bands like Oxymoron are pulling off now, but 20 years before its time. The only place where this recording falters is in the slowed down, reggae-tinged tunes like Ghost Town - these boys were listening to a bit too much Clash, and the results are a bit grating. All in all, though, a nice slice of seminal punk-ola."
2,Disappointed For the Most Part,"I ordered this CD for the songs that are on there, especially the song ""Hot Music""; however, I didn't know it was a CD of songs mixed into each other, and I didn't know how short each song would be. Although 90% of the songs on this CD I love, I give it 2 stars because none of these songs are in its entirety, and it's very misleading to the music lover that wants to do his/her own mix and add to his/her own collection."
3,Good soap - lite scent,"My husband uses this soap and I can detect a slight hint of it right after he showers, but that's all. He loves the soap though - and I'll buy it again for him."
2,"Another outline, informative but not comprehensive","Do not rely on this as your only reference for tax issues. While it helps to identify pitfalls and points you to seeking and obtaining professional advice, it does not work as a ""DIY"" guide."
2,Kindle Version Lacking,Looks like a great book but there seems to be a lot missing in the Kindle version. The text keeps referring to figures and lists that I can't find.
5,I can't believe how much I'm learning!!,Okay...I've owned a business for nearly 20 years and have an accountant...but I figured I might as well educate myself a bit and WOW...this has been a revelation. I have learned more in a few short reading sessions with this book that have ultimately led to my discussing items with my accountant which will save me a lot of hard earned income...and just make me a heckuva lot better informed in general.I generally find the NOLO books to be definitive but of the half dozen I own this is the one that I find myself reaching for most often.If you are beginning a business I would rate this as nothing short of essential. Had I been aware of this book from the start my life would have been so much easier and my bottom line a bit better as well.
5,True Original Talent,"A combination of Jazz, Hip-hop & Great Taste. This album is definately not for the american idol or commercialized music fans. If you're a true musician, like real talent and good, original music you'll like DJ Zeph no doubt about it."
3,solid debut!,"tracklisting:1. percussion discussion2.the movement3. get this4. southpause5. rubberglue6. bronx zulu7. freehand8. mirrors on sand9. imperial's theme10. transmitterfuture primitive head, dj zeph will definitely have some heads nodding on this 10 track album featuring cuts from dj zeph (duh), quest and imperial. rhymes via azeem and uptempo jazz comps from bay area and widehive records artists. in the opening track, ""percussion discussion"" zeph hits us with some ritualistic type sh!t with sprinkles of the sitar. ""mirrors on sand"" brings us azeem with a live, irrie rhodes and bass rhythm section. ""bronx zulu"" features heavy brass and a sax over zeph's funky beat. layered, lush and very very busy are the words to describe his album. with the wide variety of sounds in dj zeph's self titled album, its obvious that the bay area's environment has influenced the direction of the album. and indeed, thats a good thing."
4,An unexpected surprise!,"What I thought would be a typical low budget flick, turned out to be a high quality and highly entertaining movie. I really recommend buying or at least renting a copy!"
5,Amazing!,"This is an amazing independent film! I'd call it the edgy brother of ""Pulp Fiction"" with shades of ""Memento"" smoldering on the side. Gritty and raw with cutting satirical social commentary, make this a must see movie. The dialogue, acting and cinematography are tightly wrapped and drop kicked into your consciousness. A definite find and great addition to any DVD library."
4,Exciting and educational premonition.,"Stirring page turner is a refreshing break from the current 911 genre that descibes what mother nature can do on her own. Picked this up over the holidays and couldn't put it down. As a physician I was as excited as the novel's protagonist in piecing together the puzzle, and just as afraid of the implications of what he might find.Like the previous reviewer, I found the vaccine issues prescient and had it not been for the real events w/ the flu vaccine I would have dismissed this as improbable. Makes me a bit wary of the as to how other events in the plot might unfold in real life.Also paints a lovely picture of a part of the NE USA that is probably not well known in most of the country.Captivating, educational, and foreboding."
2,Made cat act weird,This flea collar might work fine but I couldn't leave it on my cat any longer.It had a powdery smell so it didn't smell like chemicals or anything but from the minute I put it on my cat she started squinting and acting lethargic.She just wasn't acting like herself so after a few days I took it off.
3,"If they can't read, don't buy it!","I bought this for my 5 year old daughter. She was quickly disappointed because the only way to figure out what to do is to be able to read what the characters are saying to one another. It is very easy to navigate around and if it is on the easy setting, there is usually a small arrow that lets you know which way you need to move the character. Very cute, but as I said--If your child can't read yet, don't buy it!!!!!!!"
4,Help!,Hi I was wondering if any one knew how to get past the part where Laura has to find her Mom's Jewelry for Tommy? It would be really helpful.
3,"Waiting, waiting, waiting, mediocre ending","Started out pretty interesting. Middle was a little drawn out. Ending was a head scratcher. I was looking for a interesting ending to make up for the slow middle and,,,,,nothing.Keep in mind that this was written at the turn of the century so wording and writing style are consistent with that time and takes some getting used to,"
2,The Purple Cloud,"After reading the reviews on this book, and learning what the plot was about, I was excited to give this book a try.Unfortunately, I really got bogged down in the details as the author describes the main character's journey to London. He could have tidied that part up a bit, perhaps shortening it dramatically to give the story the opportunity to breathe. Instead, it became such a chore to slog through each page that I finally just gave up.Disappointed...should have been a much better book."
3,Written 100 years ago (not this review),"Early on, this story impressed me. Well written, good story line, good syntax, minimal expletives,courageous main character--all features of a good read. When the protagonist and the reader realize that he (we) are it, the last guy, the Lone Ranger, the only chip left in the bag--then it falls apart. He begins to dither. The author starts writing the same thing in different ways. It's like he had to fill his quota of words for the book. Other reviewers describe him as going crazy, but I think he just went boring. Anyone can write bad stuff (like this review?) but I was expecting better."
5,beyond expectation,I ordered an old paperback and was delighted to see it was in good condition. It was as described by mab1218 and the price was very good. I was especially pleased with the service of mab1218 because I received my order in a matter of days. So it was beyond my expectation and I am a satisfied customer.
5,Excellent horror/scifi,"Lovecraft mentioned this novel in his ""Supernatural Horror In Literature"" essay, and had good things to say about it. The novel deserves the good words. The first half, before our hero finds the inevitable woman to complete him, is really dark. A man alone, totally alone, with only corpses around him. I think that would send me ""over the edge"", too. Shiel captures the pathos of the situation well. Unlike Lovecraft, though, I like the ""romantic"" ending. At least the human race will not die out. This is well worth reading."
4,Genesis Redux,"This book indeed establishes the ""Last Man on Earth"" genre. The main character had an encyclopedic knowledge which seemed a bit of a stretch at times; he was a scientist who had an amazing ability to sail the seven seas alone. He was also an architect who managed to build a palace all by himself. His grasp of world cultures was astounding. But, aside from that, the book was entertaining, along the same lines as Robinson Crusoe."
5,"""It does not require many words to say the truth""","This is a little book, but so involving and so inspiring.Ohiyesa speaks of his own childhood, of his own life, of the believes and values he grew by, and he does it in a very simple, almost candid way. He doesn't use philosophy, although you may find yourself considering philosophical aspects of life while reading this. He just says what it was taught to him, and why it is valuable to him, with regard to life, to the way people should treat people and the other beings sharing this world, and the world itself.He does speak about misunderstanding regarding his people and especially their more profound believes, but never in a polemical way.It's really as if he were saying: ""This is what I was handed down by people who came before me. This is why it's important and valuable to me. I'm handing it down to you. You're free to receive it, if you think it's worthy.""It's as simple as this."
5,Dr Eastman,I have bought several of doctor eastman's books and will continue to buy them until i have all his works. I plan to have them as required reading for my son as he matures.
2,Egg Ring,I was looking for a way to make eggs round...like McD's does but this product was more trouble than help.It's not heavy enough to keep the egg from running out from the underneath. I finally gave up...scooped the egg back in the ring after it had run and set some and plopped it on the english muffin...sadly it was too big for the muffin so the whole thing was kind of disappointing.
2,Egg Rings,Did not realize ring was not solid where the handle connects. The gap lets the egg white leak out and the egg sticks to the ring.
2,Would not buy again,"The little handles on these egg rings fold down, which is great for fitting them in a drawer, but bad because the ""seam"" where the handle is attached makes for a place where part of the egg seeps out of the ring during cooking. So, you don't get the perfectly round cooked egg that is the whole purpose for the ring! I used them twice and have never used them again. On the plus side, they are indeed non-stick."
3,A Mess To Clean,Not a great design. The folding handle makes it easy to store but the split also gives egg a place to flow and stick.
4,pretty good,i like the new look for batman but they culd have been a little closer to hasbro with his design nightwing is ok. finnaly a toy company tryed to play the cape a little closer to the show by making it drape over the shoulders. i think they should try to make something like detective batman with a soft vynle version of the cape
4,A New Orleans lover's dream!,"If you like New Orleans music -- cajun, zydeco, r&b, etc, this cd is for you.With groups big on the current New Orleans scene like The Iguanas and the Dirty Dozen, this live cd will take you back to New Orleans in no time.The Mountain Stage always puts out great releases, and this one is no different."
3,A very different style of Hildegard,"This CD isn't quite the shining example of Hildegard's music, but it isn't dissapointing either. The new-agey music and the chanting go well together, but at times the mix is a little akward, and it is those moments when it seems that the vocals are just stamped on top of the music that takes away from this album. Otherwise, the music is pretty rich and conjures epic and heavenly images. I'd have to side with the 'purists' on this one: if you're a stickler for authentic sounding Hildegard music, go for the other albums such as Luminous Spirit because this one might come across as a little weird."
4,"Sweet, soothing. Good Music","I heard the song 'Vision' in a different CD and I knew I had to get more of Hildegarde Von Bingen's music, so I got this CD. The music is altogether very nice and pure. I agree with another reviewer that it would have been better if it had been left more pristine than tarnishing it with modern sounds but nonetheless, this CD is still a good buy and the music is higher.You can feel the spirit in which Hildegarde von bingen would've composed this music (or gotten inspired).I did see some other composers who have produced her music so I would say listen to their samples as well, and see if you feel they are better. But I found more songs in this CD than any other I could find.Recommended."
5,SUPERB MODERN CLASSIC,"SOARING, ETHEREAL voices are followed by haunting, vaguely Middle Eastern new age sound. HILDEGARD meets ENIGMA. It works. The purists make no room for this kind of interpretation of Hildegard but I remind you that the Louvre built a separate museum to house the Impressionist art not because they were so valued but because they did not consider it serious art and would not put it under the same roof with the classics. Time made buffoons of them. Listen to the sound clips and judge for yourself."
4,Very different. Hauntingly beautiful,"I bought VISION, THE MUSIC OF HILDEGARD VON BINGEN without even hearing it first. I couldn't resist the album's cover art and the premise of recording the chants of a 12th century nun with modern original scores. I was delightfully surprised at how well the experiment works. The tracks are absolutely beautiful and haunting. In listening to one of the chants accompanied by an almost jarring drum beat, I felt as if I were dropped deep into a dense African jungle where a safari of large powerful natives are escorting small white hooded nuns to some mysterious lost city. A very different, very intriguing, very fine work."
1,I agree with Amazon,"I, too, bought this cd used for a very low price and found out why when I got it home. I was looking for Hildegard and was vastly disappointed. I'll remember next time that you get what you pay for."
5,Musical snobs need not apply!,"This CD is one of the most beautiful i have ever heard. The last track, the full version of ""Vision"", gives me rapturous goosebumps and brings a smile to my lips and tears to my eyes every single time i hear it, and that's frequently! Unfortunately there are a lot of what i call ""musical snobs"" out there who somehow have the idea that innovation is a deadly sin and ""reinterpretation"" is a dirty word; by adding - horrors! - MODERN instrumentation and - gasp! - ETHNIC beats to the pristine vocals of Hildegard's plainsongs, Richard Souther has committed a dastardly deed in their eyes. So, if you are only interested in your own narrow definition of how her music should be presented, don't bother buying this album. It will be your loss, though, because it is stunning, blissful, rich, exotic, moving and worshipful. Personally i think if Hildegard could hear the magic Souther has woven with her songs, it would just take her breath away."
1,Vision,The music of Hildegard was very haunting and screechy. I have one of her songs on another CD which was beautiful and calming. That is why I bought this one but was very disappointed. I cannot even listen to it a second time.
2,"Interesting idea, inconsistent execution","Some people take offense at the very suggestion of modernizing medieval music by adding electronic accompaniment. I have no problem with the concept of this recording, but Souther's understanding of Hildegard's music seems limited and simplistic. While there are some really gorgeous moments when the synthesizers truly complement the modal structures of the melodies, too often Souther falls back on cliched romantic chromaticism that is only a cut or two above Yanni in inventiveness and clashes with the purity and elegance of Hildegard's music."
3,"Interesting experiment, mixed success.","Richard Souther's electronic, sometimes techno arrangement/accompaniment of Hildegard's pure and intense melodies is an experiment that works well for certain pieces (Virga ac Diadema, O Frondens Virga, O Euchari in Leta Via) but fails for others.In any case the voice and performance of Emily Van Evera is very uplifting, even if the final product is not exactly what she was expecting."
2,Not for purists.,"Richard Souther's project melds world beat with liturgical songs of the 12th-century abbess. The result may work for those who regularly plumb the shallows of New Age music, but purists of Hildegard von Bingen will roil at it as vapid and unnecessary distraction."
2,Not much happening,"Some of Ms. Warlick's writing is better suited for the short story form. I found myself wondering where this novel was going. While the language is beautiful and lush, I found myself wanting more. More plot, more character, more risks."
3,Lyrical sentences do not a novel make.,"Although sometimes beautifully written, this work does not stand up to literary scrutiny. The overly sophisticated-for-her-years main character is simply a device to showcase some Southern eccentrics. The incestuous lust between Mavis and her Uncle Owen creeped me out--as well as the constant skin-groping of every character--I haven't read such a touchy-feelie novel before, and hope not to again. By the way, the editor should have explained that no American except poets actually uses the word ""'neath""."
1,Disappointing approach to young women,"Reading Warlick's work, I wonder if she spent time creating this world or rather wrote it in a day. The characters do not have the continuity that makes to many writers truly great. I felt a letdown as I followed the heroine through a rather spastic journey throughout the novel."
2,A work in progress,"I felt reading this piece that while Warlick has had experience writing, her characters all cry out for further development. This is something I would more likely see in a beginning fiction course, where her style could be developed into something more refined. Overall a writer and work still in the making."
1,The Ginger Man Sucks,"I tried very hard to finish this book. Could not do it! J. P. Donleavey must have been as drunk & tortured as Sebastian himself. The reason I bought the book was because I read J. P.'s book in which he narrates what it entailed to ""finally"" have it published & printed by The French. It could have remained in France ad infinitum as far as I am concerned. Pamela Levasseur, New Ipswich, NH"
2,"Not Exactly a Waste of Time, But Pretty Close","Here we have what has been billed as a comic masterpiece that by my standards just doesn't seem funny. Perhaps my problem is that I went to medical school and trained in psychiatry and consequently can spot a no good psychopath when I see one. Yep, That's what Dangerfield really is and his recurrent pattern of abnormal behavior, his lack of guilt, and his failure to love anyone (even himself) prove it. Spend your precious time reading something else instead. About about The Magnificient Ambersons which came in one behind Ginger Man on the list of the 100 best novels of the 20th century, but happens to be 100 times better."
1,Boring and Senseless,"Gosh this book sucked. What was so funny about it? Am I missing something? Ok, a few sences were comical but highly not worth wasting your time to get to them. The rest was just rambling BS. Only good feelings the ending left me with was that, WOW, If JP D could get this published and on the top 100 list, there is hope. Write some abstract BS with a bit of a comment on society and humanity and you're set. Anyway, dont read this book. Well, fine, read it. Go ahead. But if you're really looking for some good Irish Lit check out something else."
1,Please don't believe the blurbs,"""A comic masterpiece"" The Nation. No, it wasn't the least bit funny.When I saw that this book came out in 1965, it struck me that it's main character represents all the worst characteristics of that era- self-centered, irresponsible to the point of being dangerous to his family and anyone he comes in contact with.Not funny. Who cares if it was ""well-written?"" If Hitler had written his memoirs, and they were ""well-written"", should we care?"
4,Rabbit Angstrom's Older Brother?,"I'm into THE GINGER MAN right now, and enjoying it tremendously. I wonder if John Updike read this book before he wrote RABBIT, RUN. Rabbit and Sebastian have similar qualities; they are both scoundrels to love. Also, I'm wondering if the title is derived from the rhyme: run, run as fast as you can/you can't catch me/I'm the ginger [bread] man!"
2,what? no gum drop buttons?,"Here are the ribald, picaresque (choose your own hackneyed adjective) adventures of Sebastian Dangerfield in Ireland and London, as he drinks & scrumps & sponges his way through life. Perhaps it is unfair to Donleavy, but I happened to read this at the same time as I was listening to the audio version of Angela's Ashes , so I just didn't find it amusing when Danger drank the family's food money & beat his wife and girlfriends & so on.But even taken on it's own terms, it's just not a particularly entertaining book.GRADE: D"
4,Shake off the shock,"Jump right in and be prepared at first to hate Dangerfield. He's everything you want to despise in a someday-will-be trust-funder jerk. The antics, strangely, will grow on you. After I finished I found myself reading certain choice chapters again (do you feel a breeze?--although my favorite- the Christmas tirade).A worthwhile read that does not waste any time-- while giving us that aspire to write a fresh look, and those of us going after the Top 100 a checkmark...."
1,Irritating,"At 368 pages, this book is 368 pages too long. I see it is number 255,203 on Amazon Best Sellers and that just about sums it up.I read this book about 15 years ago and I am still amazed that I finished it. I remember thinking, it can't be this bad when so many people like it and say it is funny. Well, it was that bad and I don't know what they were thinking.It certainly isn't funny. Nasty, stupid, boring are the words I would use.On a scale of 1 to Catcher in the Rye overrated, I would give this a Catcher in the Rye."
1,Not funny at all,Critics quoted on the back of this book called it a comedy. But I saw nothing funny about the scenes where he mistreats his wife and child or any of the other people in his life. Do not understand at all how this book made it on the Modern Library's top 100 list.
2,Imitation Joyce,"Yet another book about drinking,fighting,and whoring in Ireland. Author is a good writer, but uses a ""poetic"" style that is not always effective. A rather bleak book with little comedy.I really would not put this book in the top 100,no matter what Random House thinks. I suspect the book is somewhat autobiographical, which would explain why it has such a weak plot. If you must read it, I suggest speed-reading ;if you invest too much time you will be disappointed."
2,Donleavy Proves that Art Doesn't Have to Be Pretty.,"A college professor once told me a profound truth that is very pertinent to this work: Art Doesn't Have to be Pretty. This novel certainly isn't! I think I could have enjoyed this novel, but I kept on waiting to be amused. Unfortunately, I didn't find Dangerfield very funny at all. The author presented the character in a fairly sympathetic, yet not pathetic way. I especially enjoyed the stream of conciousness writing technique.In the final analysis, I just couldn't overlook the fact that I thought that Dangerfield was a poor excuse for a human being. I will be very dissapointed if ""Ulysses"" focuses on a character just as dispicable."
1,"Unpleasant, uninteresting and unfunny","I found this book to be a complete waste of my time. I didn't laugh, I didn't cry - I just didn't care about whatever it was the author was trying to convey. Who wants to read about the crap between his character's toes, not I, and I am not easily disgusted. If you want something funny read Confederacy of Dunces or David Sedaris' stuff."
1,not 99th best novel,"This is on the Modern Library panel's list as the 99th best novel in English in this century. It is an awful and nauseous book, telling of Rodney Dangerfield, an American in Ireland and England, who is immoral, blasphemous, and extremely uninteresting. I was sure glad to get to the last page. The blurb on the jacket from Time says Donleavy makes the reader love Dangerfield for his killer instinct, flamboyant charm, wit, flashing generosity--and above all for his wild, fierce, two-handed grab for every precious second of life. This is all false, IMHO--I despised him and thought he was a stupid, asinine bore who did revolting things."
3,Wild and Lusty,"Three hundred forty seven pages of mayhem. About the moral degradation of one Sebastian Dangerfield, a rake from hell and St. Louis, who is supposed to be studying law in Dublin, on the G. I. Bill. He is a a cad with women, a con artist, deadbeat, philanderer, boozer and brawler--not a very likeable bloke.This book is an entertaining read and very funny at times, but a bit low on redeeming social value. Stream of consciousness, with occasional lapses into surrealism."
2,What WAS so great about it?,"Let's just say I finished the book only to find out what happens to the character. I was sorely disappointed. Where was the development of the character? I kept waiting for a change in his outlook, hope of things to come - anything - it never came... At least with George Amberson, he grew out of his selfishness and became human. The stream-of-conscious writing was effective - I did start to feel sorry for the character. In the end, I was disappointed he never learned anything."
1,Couldn't squeeze an ounce of enjoyment from this one.,"I must agree with Dave_Gannon@msn.com regarding this ""abomination."" Reviews on the front cover called it a ""comic masterpiece"" but I found Sebastian Dangerfield a terribly depressing character with absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever. There was not a single character of which to endear me and as Gannon said I only finished the book because I have a strict policy that I finish each novel I begin hoping in this case that Mr. Donleavy was going to surprise me at the end and justify my decision to finish the book. Unfortunately the last paragraph left me frustrated and confused and feeling that maybe I should rethink my policy."
3,morality vomit,"the things sebastian dangerfield does in The Ginger Man are human. its donleavy's ability to paint this humanity that makes the book sing. all the goons hung up on sebastian's moral code should screw off.if you could get away with no work, infidelity, and champion drinking you'd do it, too. If you're looking for a portal to the dirty truth about the pain of being a man, read it. and for the rest of you ..., you should check it out, too-it'll make you feel righteous."
1,Not Funny At All,"Great art? I guess. I'll take the serious critics' word. Art need not be pretty? I can accept that. Lusty? Sure enough, but there are many lustier tales around. But wildly funny? A comic masterpiece? Not for me. I could barely manage a smile now and then. Buy and read it for art's sake or to admire craftsmanship, but you will waste your dime if you want a laugh."
1,This book ticked me off!!,"I could not get past page 76. I tried, but I don't like the main character. I can see some humor, but not enough to save the book. And I don't respect people who manipulate others and cheat other people. So glad I bought it used!!!"
2,Did I Miss Something?,"Even if I don't particularly like a critically acclaimed novel, I can usually understand the reason for the acclaim. Not so with ""The Ginger Man."" I honestly don't understand why this book is so praised by the literary establishment. It doesn't break any new ground stylistically (in fact, I think J.P. Donleavy's writing is pretty anonymous) or thematically. The description on the book's back cover would have you believe this is a rollicking farce about a lovable cad---don't you believe it. This book isn't funny. The ""lovable cad"" is actually a jerk and by the time he'd gotten drunk and abusive for the thousandth time, I had made up my mind that the literary establishment that loves ""The Ginger Man"" must have all been drunk themselves when they decided this book is a must read.It's not difficult, but neither is it in the least bit interesting."
2,Bored in Space,"Graphics - 1/5Very low poly count for a PS2 game. Horribly bland art design.Game Control - 3/5Controls feel sluggish but are thankfully simplistic.Gameplay - 2/5Extremely generic shooter, but has decent challenge at least.Story - 1/5Although some work went into it, the story is far too cheesy and generic.Music - 1/5Bland as all get-out. Sounds like it was pulled from a PS1 BGM bargain bin.Overall Score - 1.6 / 5Qualities range from mediocre to horrible. I don't recommend this purchase for anyone; it is easily the worst space shooter I have ever had the misfortune to play."
3,I liked the product -- it beats shaving ...,"I liked the product -- it beats shaving any day. However, it seemed to take longer and didn't take all my hair off in one try. I have lots of hair though, so maybe it might work better on a different person."
1,No thanks! I'll stick with my razor. The ...,"No thanks! I'll stick with my razor. The Nair itched and stung while it was on, didn't take the hair off very well, and my legs were all red afterward. Shaving is quicker, less irritating, and works better."
4,This product worked great on legs and arms. ...,"This product worked great on legs and arms. It takes off all the hair in one application and really does leave your skin very soft and moisturized without the very strong smells that I remember from earlier products. When I used it on my upper lip, it was very irritating -- leaving my skin red for several hours and actually causing little blisters on the top border of my lip. It's possible I left it on a bit longer that the minimum four minutes they recommend, or that I may be more sensitive than the average person, but I certainly didn't leave it on longer than the 10 minutes that the product packaging recommends. I'll use this product again because for certain areas it did a fabulous job... but I'll certainly be cautious about using it on the more sensitive areas of my body again."
1,This product was very disappointing. Even though I ...,"This product was very disappointing. Even though I showered right before using Nair 3 in 1 to soften the hair, it still worked poorly. My legs weren't as smooth as with shaving, and they became irritated. I used the product three times in one week and the only difference between that and shaving is that the Nair moisturized my legs. That one benefit is not worth me sitting for 10-15 minutes to wait for the product to work. I feel the package needs to be clearer, as well. I had to read the tiny print of the """"warning"""" to learn where on my body I could and couldn't use it. I won't be purchasing this product for myself, and certainly won't recommend it to anyone. Just keep your razor."
4,This product smells very pleasant (I remember the ...,"This product smells very pleasant (I remember the smell being horrible a few years ago) and it really works. It gets rid of even the toughest hair, and a little closer than shaving with a new blade. (I'd say it gives you about a four-hour """"head start"""" over shaving.) The negatives are that you can get a wicked rash. I do NOT have sensitive skin, and three days later I still have some of the rash - eek! I'd think that sun would exacerbate this, so be careful and test first!"
1,AWFUL,"This whole collection is awful, don't waster your money. My husband and I love ""b-horrors"" but these collections are the worst of the worst. It looks like a junior-high film project at best and is literally shot in someone's basement. Plus unlike most other ""B-horror"" movies, it's just boring. Would not recommend even to ""b-horror movie"" lovers!"
2,Get what you pay for,"Exactly what the title says!!! Wish I would have gone with my gut instint of not buying this one. When you have 6 movies on 2 discs for the price that they were offering, I should have known better but I thought I would at least give it try and hope for the best."
3,Stay Put Suction Bowl - sometimes,"Maybe it's just my wily 14-month-old grandson, but nimble toddler fingers can muscle the bowl off the highchair tray. I think the bowl is great, but he thinks it's a challenge. I'll continue to use it and hope he gets bored with the game, as it is a great way for him to feed himself."
2,Does not suction,I like think the idea of our child not flinging his bowl on the floor while his was becoming more independent.These suction bowls did not do has promised.They become just another baby/toddler bowl in our cupboard.
1,What's the point if they don't suction?,"None of the 3 bowls suction. I've tried wetting them, drying them. Tried them on many different surfaces. No luck! I'll be contacting Munchkin directly. What a disappointment."
3,Suction wears out,"These worked in the beginning, but after repeated washing, the suction didn't work as well. We found that if you moisten the suction cup before pressing it down on the tray/table, then it stuck pretty well. They do not suction on to wood, laminate, or any surface that has texture. It sticks best to smooth plastic (like the highchair tray) or glass. The lids are difficult to put on, but once on, they are really secure and do not leak.These are not microwaveable.We now use plates as the bowls were too deep for our toddler to scoop her own food out with a spoon or fork.The bowls are deep, which helps cut down on the mess factor, but also makes it difficult for baby to see the food inside the bowl, especially when it is on the inside part closest to baby. I guess it depends on the height of your tray and your baby's height.I recommend for short term use for one baby."
2,SUCTION DOESN'T LAST,These bowls only stay suctioned down for a few minutes. I prefer The First Years Meal Mates bowls. They stay suctioned indefinitely.
4,Works For Me !!,"I have used these bowls on several surfaces. On my table, I wipe the table first with a little water and the bowl is nearly impossible for my baby to move. Some of you old reviews should give that a try. If your baby can still remove it after that trick, then try stepping in and teaching him some manners!"
3,Nice bowls...but only as bowls.,"I bought these because my son loves to push his bowl, plate, cup, etc all over his highchair tray and then pick them up and dump them (usually on his head). I thought the suction base on these would alleviate this, I was wrong and other reviewers were correct. The suction does not work. I tried the water trick and put all my force into sticking the bowl to his tray and within minutes he had it loose and had dumped his dinner on his head.It is nice that they come in bright and fun colors with secure lids though, makes it easy to store in the fridge or take snacks along on outings."
4,Lets me eat my dinner,"My little guy is so pleased to be eating by himself and showing us all what a big boy he is now that we can put his food in a bowl that will stay put enough to not fall off the highchair tray. He can pull the bowl off if he wants to perform his gravity experiments instead of eat, but if I keep the bowl full of something interesting, that isn't usually an issue. Love that I can fill these up and not worry that my bag will end up a mess."
1,doesn't stick,"These bowls don't stick to the plastic tops on high chairs. My daughter is only 1 and can rip them right off. I bought these in the hopes of her learning how to eat from a bowl, but she just pulls them off and throws them."
2,"Suction mediocre, lids ill-fitting","Like many other reviewers, I found the suction to be mediocre on these. I bought 2 sets and some of them stick really well and don't come off at all and others don't suction at all, even with a little water on the bottom. Fortunately, my toddler is starting to get over the 'let's pick up the bowl and dump everything on the floor' phase so the suction thing doesn't bother me as much anymore. However, the lids are really hard to use. They are really ill-fitting and it takes a lot of time and effort to get them to snap on. Who's got time to mess with lids with a young toddler running around? So, if you don't need lids much or suction, then these bowls are nice and deep and the variety of sizes available is very handy (although that would sort of defeat the purpose of buying these, right?)."
1,Poorly made,The materials used to make these attractive bowls stinks! It comes out of the dishwasher with white crust that won't come off. When I washed the first bowl I thought it was a fluke and even tried to scrape of the stuff (didn't work). Then I realized it happened with all three bowls. I've thrown them away because now they're ugly!
3,"Suction is sucky, not in the good way","We were hoping these stay-put bowls really would stay put through the toddler terror of dumping food out. No such luck. The lids are tight and food doesn't spill out while travelling so that's a perk. The bowls are colorful and make eating more ""fun"" and enticing for my toddler. I suppose the purchase wasn't a total waste just don't expect the moon and the stars, if you know what I mean..."
2,Doesn't stay put,I bought this because I thought it would prevent my 6-month-old from tipping the contents of his bowl - I was wrong. My son is easily able to un-stick this bowl from his high chair tray. Maybe it will be useful when he's a little older and learning to eat with a spoon. But it doesn't help me now.
4,I have a love/hate relationship with these!!,"I love the colors, sizes and durability, plus it's dishwasher safe top rack. I hate the fact that it doesn't ""stick"" or ""grip"" the high chair table I have at all...so, my son does pick the thing right up! Hence, 4 stars not 5..still a good buy I use daily."
2,"Stay put? Yeah, right.","Cute, sturdy bowls. They are a wonderful idea, but they don't stay put. These bowls don't even require pulling on from my infant, and up they come. She thinks they're super fun to dump out. I think the clean-up game isn't quite as fun.I wouldn't recommend these bowls, and I'm debating on just throwing mine away.Save your money."
2,Suction isn't strong enough,"We have 2 types of trays for my 8 months old, these bowls do not stay on either of the trays. I leave the bowl with food in it, leave and come back in 1 mins, he is grabbing his bowl hitting the tray. Of course, the food is all over."
2,no suction,"I was so excited to get these suction bowls, but they dont suction very well. I wouldnt buy this again"
1,I would not buy,I have purchased both the bowls and plates and both have been disappointing. The suction does not last and is no better than any other plastic (cheaper) product.
1,save your money,"I bought these thinking it would help my daughter learn to self-feed without dumping her food everywhere. I put cheerios in the bowl, stuck the bowl to our glass top table. It took my 14 month old (literally) ten seconds to unstick the bowl. These bowls ""unstick"" so easily that a brush from the dog's tail (when a bowl was ""stuck"" to the coffee table) also knocked the bowl over. I thought it might be a flaw with one or two bowls- all 6 that I purchased do the same thing. Save your money."
2,doesnt really suction.,I bought the 3 bowl set with the hopes that it would hold the bowl to his high chair tray just enough to enable my son to pick out his finger food without spilling all over his lap. Alas it did not. I feel dissapointed that i basically just bought 3 plastic bowls as the suction part is non functional for more than 3 seconds. Ive tried using dampness to create a better seal and its to no avail. my advice? save your money. this is a great idea but someone has yet to put it into practical implementation.
2,Suction sucks.,"These bowls are a good size for my son (10 months when I bought these)--the large one for meals, smaller for snacks. But the lids are very hard to get on and off and the suction took him all of about 10 seconds to get loose. Not so great."
4,"Decent, but not what I expected","I definately should've read the reviews before I bought these bowls. They don't keep my daughter from tossing her food 'overboard' but I think they *will* be quite useful when she is learning to eat with a spoon on her own. I really *do* like the bowls themselves, and the lids (they seal nicely and transport food pretty well). I wish the suction was better, but otherwise, these are great bowls."
3,Doesn't stay put,"I bought these for my daycare, particularily for a one-yr old and I put them on and she pulls them right off. Maybe for a younger age it would work, but I wanted to be able to put hot foods in them like mac & chz, etc... and have her be able to grab it. Not very impressed."
5,I love them!,"I am surprised by the other complaints. We have had these bowls for a few months, and they work great with my toddler. As long as I make sure the table is really clean, they suction well. If he really works hard with his little fingers he may be able to break the suction, but mostly, they do the job. My son was dumping every other bowl or plate we tried. I love the different sizes and the gender-neutral colors. Also, the lids stay on tight and are safe to put in the diaper bag without spillage. I have bought them for gifts."
1,They do NOT stay put,"This bowls are worthless. The suction cups do not work. I've tried everything. I make sure the surface is super clean, I add a little bit of water to try to create a greater suction, no luck. My 16 month old daughter pulls them up with ease. The bowls are a good size, but if you're looking for something to stay put, these are not a good buy."
2,Sucks...not in a good way,"these suck because they don't suck for long. They worked at first but time has proved, getting a cheaper regular bowl would suffice."
1,"Great idea, but doesn't work","These bowls would be great if they worked. We've had these bowls for 2 years and they never stick to a tray for more than a few seconds to a couple of minutes. Just when I let my guard down they'd come loose and were easy for a little one to fling across the room. With regular bowls parents wouldn't expect them to stick in the first place and would be more prepared. (The lids on these bowls are very difficult to snap and unsnap, so I'd recommend another set of bowls entirely.)"
2,Should have returned...,"These are really cute bowls. Unfortunately I find them completely ineffective.Pros:Pretty colorsNo sharp plastic edges or seamsCons:Suction cups are ineffective at keeping the bowl in one place - very easy for the baby to get them unstuckThe bottoms of the bowls are not very wide, so once the suction cup has been disengaged the bowl goes overThe covers don't reliably stay on if you want to put them in a diaper bag or even a lunch boxI suspect that if you don't ever put them in the dishwasher (they are listed as top-rack safe) or even wash them with hot water, they might work better... but who has time for that?"
2,Suction cups don't stick!,"The suction cups on these bowls are no match for a toddler. They fail to stick, which defeats the purpose of buying the product. The bowls still work as unbreakable bowls, and the covers make them good for carrying food on trips if necessary, but if you're trying to thwart a little dumper, don't bother with these."
3,Wish the bowls would stay put like the lids do.,"These bowls are very cute, but that's not what's important here. As a parent you know that cleaning spaghetti out of your hair and grout is importnat. These bowls only stayed suctioned to ANY surface a handful of times since I started using them 10 months ago. I thought it was because sometimes I would put them directly on the highchair tray without the washable tray insert on it first. Nope. Didn't matter. I have never washed these in the dishwasher as I am not a fan of exposing plastics to high temps and then putting my baby's food in it. Not to preach. So the dishwasher isn't causing malfunction. Now on the other hand the lids...wow they stay put. I even have to put my weight into it to get it closed. So kudos there Munchkin, but no go on the suction! I also like the fact that it's BPA free. I don't ban it in my house, but like to see there are reasonably priced BPA-free options out there. Overall if I had to give these bowls a grade....C-."
2,Suction cup sucks!!!,"The product looks good...but the suction cup does NOT hold bowl in place for more that 1 min!!!I've tried every single bowl with suction cup on it, hoping to prevent my daughter from dumping the bowl with food on the floor...so far I haven't had any luck!I would suggest the maker of this product to try a bigger suction cup...this one is to little! Won't do its job!"
1,"""Stay-Put"" Bowls Don't Stay Put!","Don't waste your money. The suction doesn't work. I learned the hard way after I wasted my money, filled the bowl with applesauce and within seconds it was all over. This company shouldn't even be allowed to call these ""Stay Put Suction Bowls"". Another parent duped into a useless baby product..."
4,Love them - just high maintenance!!,"The bowls are great, the suction works well, and I will be buying another couple sets. However, the suction ring can be ruined if it touches anything (prong) in the dishwaser. One of my bowls rested against a prong and melted, I guess you could say, and it now has a notch in the suction ring which makes it impossible to suction down. Annnnd the bowls are NOT microwave safe. So I should be giving them a low rating but I can't find a better bowl that suctions and has the attributes these bowls do have - otherwise they are just high maintenance!!! So if you hand wash and don't use them in the microwave they are great :)"
2,my expectation was a cup that stayed on the table,"Many of the other reviewers say that these are good as long as we have the right expectations. Well when I order a ""stay put suction bowl"" I EXPECT it to STAY PUT. The suction lasts a few seconds on granite, less on the wood dining table. (Also tried glass, tile, aluminum, and marble- none work). I am very disappointed. Also, although their website says ""very few of Munchkin products contain BPA"" no where does this baby product say that it is BPA free, let alone phthalate and PVC free. Does anyone know if I can still get my money back even though I already opened the package? I give two stars because I like the size and that they come with lids, that's good. They will make good little bowls for something."
1,waste of money,These are terrible. 2 out of 3 bowl lids do not fit at all. The suction does not stay on tray. Aweful product!
3,"Ok, but don't expect them to stick!","I like these bowls because they discourage my son from flipping his bowl, but they do not completely prevent him from doing so. The suction on these bowls is not strong at all, so be prepared!"
1,waste of money,The suction cup does not work. It did not even hold the first time I used them. All they do is take up space in my cupboard.
3,"Cute, but not great suction","These bowls are super cute and I love the lids that come with them. The suction doesn't seem to work that great though. We bought them specifically for use on our coffee table and my son seems to get them off with hardly any effort at all. Honestly, I turned around for 2 seconds and he had it off, so it wasn't like he was working on it for awhile. They work a little better on the high chair. If you are expecting them to hold when a toddler grabs them, they won't. If you just want them to help keep the bowl still for toddlers trying to master using utensils, then they are great."
2,"Lids stay put, bowls do not.","I have the new style and they don't stick well to any of our surfaces (2 different trays, kitchen table, coffee table, kid table...). We tried a bit of water, a bit of oil, a bit of spit--no luck. They are instantly removable by our son (14 mo.) and unsuction without his help after about a minute of not being touched. This was before we put them in the dishwasher, so that is not the problem.I wanted some suction bowls to help him to learn to self feed. He is doing great, but gets frustrated when bowls move around when he tries to scoop his oatmeal. These not only popped off when he was trying to use his spoon to scoop the food, but then they flipped over because of the rubbery suction instead of just sliding like other bowls. Not fun for mommy!Back to looking for a good suction bowl!"
2,Suction cups don't work,"The other reviewers on here are right-- the suction cups don't work. My fifteen-month-old yanked it off her tray with minimal effort. I also wish they were a little shallower to make self-feeding easier. They're ok for transporting snacks, but in retrospect, I would not have bought them."
3,But what else is there...,"My wife purchased these and what a great idea, unfortunately the suction is not that great. Licking or wetting the bottom does work but only moderately. But is there another choice, maybe a $20.00/piece set from PeopleWithoutAnyFinancialSense.com that matches their $1000.00 stroller."
2,Do not stick,Cute bowls but do not stick to the tray. They do stick to the regular table better so I can see them being better when a child is older. But for my 13 month old it doesn't stop the bowl from flying over the side.
3,semi-satisfied,My only complaint-one of the lids-(for the large bowl) would not close...the others were fine but that one didn't shut...too bad.
3,It does what it's supposed to..,"But my six month old could pull it up off her high chair tray quite easily. I think it would be useful if you're just worried about it accidentally falling over, but if your kid likes to throw things.. this isn't the one for you. The lids do fit well."
4,Love the suction cups,"Nice colors, three sizes in the pack, practical design. What's there not to like? I use them every day. Going to get a second set for the travel bag."
1,Holds food..... that's about it.,This is the worst way to spend your money. My 11 month old who was born prematurely and has the fine motor skills of a 9 month old ripped this bowl off his tray within a nano second. Lame.
3,Doesn't stick as well as i would like,"The suction cup is not as strong as i would like. My baby has pulled these off of her high chair tray a few times. Especially if there is a spill on the try and any liquid gets near the base it can make the seal come undone. The lids are difficult to put on too for some reason, although i would still buy these again. For the price the benefits outweigh the risks so to speak."
2,Agree with other reviewers...bowls don't stay put,"I got these when my son was 12 months old and already a strong little guy who enjoyed dumping his bowls of food onto his high chair tray. Trying to outsmart him, I purchased these hoping to keep some food in a bowl. Much to my disappointment, they only stick to the formica countertops well. The littlest one doesn't even stick to that. None of them stays on my son's plastic high chair tray for more than a second or two.On the upside, the lids are secure once shut all the way (which can take a little work), so they make great storage for on-the-go finger foods in the diaper bag...I haven't had one leak yet, and I put things like applesauce in them to test them. Not a total waste of money, now that I found this alternate use. They wash well, without any noticeable breakdown of the plastic, on the top rack of the dishwasher."
1,Suction does not work,"I was very excited to get these bowls in the mail because they are so cute, and the concept of having a suction bowl was (and is) appealing to me. My son loved the bowl right away, as he was able to reach into the bowl for some puffs to feed himself instead of having to push the puffs around the table until he could finally grab one in his fingers. I'd also like to add that he ate tofu cubes for the first time out of this bowl and loved them! However, I'm disappointed because the suction on the bowl does not work for more than a few seconds. I'm constantly pushing the bowl back down, which is disruptive to his meal. Despite some of happy memories I've had with this bowl, I would not recommend buying these bowls because as 'suction bowls' they do not serve their purpose."
1,stay put doesn't stay put,"The suction on these bowls is so weak that the baby pulled it off the highchair and dumped the contents in a few seconds flat. They do come in lovely colors, though."
1,Not Microwave safe,No where in the product description does it tell you these are not microwave safe. This is a deal breaker. Amazon needs to work on their product descriptions.
1,What a WASTE!,"I hate these bowls. I'm going to return them. The lids are super hard to get off and the suction doesn't work at all! Sometimes I can get the bowl to stick for a matter of seconds, and I can't get them off. Then my son reaches over and pulls them off with no effort at all.If these are washed in the dishwasher and the suction cup is touching anything during the dry cycle, it will become deformed and ruin any chance you ever had of it suctioning.I wouldn't recommend these to anyone."
2,Waste of time,"Thought these would be a great learning bowl for my daughter to use. She figured out how to un-suction the bowl in about 3 seconds flat. Totally defeats the purpose of the suction bottoms. The lids do hold the food in well for traveling, but quite bulky. You're better off using plain ole tupperware when toting around food."
3,Cute bowls but they don't stay put,"I like the bowls, but I only gave them 3 stars because the big appeal is that they are supposed to suction to the tray or table. They stick to the surface for just a few seconds and then release the suction. They are still nice bowls with lids, just do not expect them to stick. If you don't need lids, save some money and get the five pack of bowls without suction cups."
2,"Suction Sucks! (By sucks, I mean there's no suction)","I bought these bowls because they had suction cups underneath the bowls, but the suction does not hold. The whole reason I spent the extra money was for the purpose of the suction keeping the bowl on the high chair. The suction sucks (or doesn't suck, whichever you prefer). I would NOT recommend these bowls."
1,dont waste your money these are worthless!,I read negative reviews and bought these anyway because I was tire of feeding my son off the high chair tray or dirty tables when we went places! These bowls do not suction! He scoops them off and throws them! Its terrible wasted that money!
2,1 out of 3 lids don't fit!,"I ordered two sets of these bowls. In both sets, the yellow lids did not fit the orange bowls. And don't mean that the seal was just less then perfect; the sizing is so far off that the lids won't go on at all. A real dissapointment,"
3,They don't really stay put,"These bowls are great for holding food and treats, but the suction cups don't really adhere well to highchair trays or tables."
3,The trick is to wet the bottom!,"I have already purchased them and I figured it was wasted money. NO IT IS NOT! To get them to stick you just need to wet the suction cup and stick it whatever. It works great for me that way. Question, would I buy these if I knew that before hand? ABSOLUTELY NOT! Im just stuck with them. If you are stuck with them as well, wet the bottom. It works great!"
4,Great Product!,"The only reason i didn't give these a 5 out of 5 is because it is difficult to get a strong suction. However, that aside, these things are great! My son is learning to eat with a spoon and these have been so helpful to have. The colors are fun as well! I do wish they were microwavable but i understand that that isn't possible because of the rubber so you just can't have both and thats ok. These serve their purpose and I am thankful to have them."
1,doesn't stay put!,"The bowls are fine, but the suction doesn't work for even a minute on the smoothest plastic. Definitely wouldn't buy it again."
1,suction not up to par,"they're great bowls w/great lids, but will not stay suctioned to tray. my son was able to pull it off the tray instantly & toss it."
2,No suction,"I saw these on one of my surfing trips though amazon. My son takes any dish that is set before him and picks it up to take a look at it, and the contents go wherever they fall. In my mind the idea of a dish that is not pick-up-able was brilliant. It still is. But I have to find a dish that fits that description and these do not. The suction has not lasted for longer than 3 minutes. At first I thought it was because my wooden table is porous and air sneaks in. So I started shopping around for plastic place-mats that would not be porous. When I finally found one, the suction did not last any longer on it. Once my son starts trying to pull the dish up it takes him less than 10 seconds. He has figured out that you have to scratch at the bottom and this will make the dish come up pretty fast. I like the design, the colors truly are gender neutral and these bowls have turned into a cute toy for my son. But they don't really work the way they are supposed to."
1,Does Not Stick,These bowls look great but don't buy them if you want bowls that actually stick and stay put!
1,Needs stronger suction,"I, thankfully, tested this product with my 9 month old BEFORE putting food in it and he was able to lift up the bowl within a minute. Nice idea but doesn't work."
2,ok but not great,"These definitely do not ""stay put"" as the name suggests. My son (1 year old) gets them off of the tray in about 5 seconds. The sizes are good though and the lids are super tight and secure which I definitely appreciate."
3,Rather play than eat,"These are great for keeping snacks in the container. He would rather shake it and play with it than eat the snacks. He has a hard time getting the snacks out, but he is pretty young. It does keep him entertained in the car."
3,A very hot story,"Passion's Web is a very hot romance - if you can call that a romance !! It's all about sex. The whole relationship is based on sex, actually they (Bryce and Natalie) have sex all the time !! The book is well written - the reason i give it three stars - but, in my opinion it isn't a romantic one, there is a lot of adventure but definitely it isn't a love story. Can you believe that they didn't marry in the end !!!That book is against all that I believe and care in a real relationship but, if you ara a BIG fan of Cassie Edward you are going to like Passion's Web."
3,Ending Disappointing,"About 80% is very engrossing but then the last 20% was a mish mash as far as I was concerned.The plot at the end became too convoluted.. I have edited my previoud review because I gave away the killer & don't want to spoil it for future readers. Sorry if I did it for those who read my review before. I have pretty much read all of her mysteries & the cream of the group,, in my humble opinion, is The Murder of Roger Ackroyd & The Moving Finger . The last doesn't get that much publicity but I thought it was fabulous!"
4,A modern performance of an older radio broadcast,The recording is very good quiality since it is a recent reproduction. We found the voice and portrayal of Poirot a bit cloying at times but the story retains its great qualities.
5,Extraordinary powers of perception.,"""Speech is an invention of man's to prevent him from thinking. It is also an infallible means of discovering that which he wishes to hide."""
3,"Good, Not Great, Agatha Christie","The A.B.C. Murders strength is also its weakness. It has a very unusual twist. That is typical of the Agatha Christie of the superb Murder of Roger Ackroyd and Murder on the Orient Express. The only problem in this mystery is that, for once, the twist seems a lot more forced, with a group of suspects that are not particularly unique or interesting. It still is alway good to read about Hercule Poirot and Hastings has returned for this adventure. And, of course, for those desiring a higher than usual Christie body count, this mystery provides a healthy dose of dead bodies. It makes for a pleasant summer read but is not up to the usual Christie standards and does not bear up to repeated visits unlike many of the Christie classics."
2,it was okay.....not the best,"I tried reading the book and it was really slow in the beginning so I didn't want to. Well, I kinda had to so when I finished I realized it's a pretty well thought out novel but I thought it was rather boring."
1,Great!,"This is the second Agatha Christie book I have read and I really enjoyed it. It keeps you hooked till the end. You won't be able to guess the murderer! I also recommend ""Death in the Clouds,"" which in my mind, is better. Agatha Christie is the best mystery author of all time."
2,Fair condition,"This book was listed in ""Good condition"", but actually arrived in ""Fair condition"". However, it did arrive within the expected time period."
3,Reading with Tequila,"The A.B.C. Murders was an average mystery, which is to say that is was good, but not Agatha Christie good. It had the possibility of great excitement and tension due to the notes Poirot was receiving before each murder but failed to capitalize on it. There was no real thrill.Poirot is known for using his ""little gray cells"" instead of doing typical physical detective work. A reader is used to seeing Poirot ponder while others scurry looking for ""real"" clues. In this novel, everyone seemed to ponder, with no real action of any kind. While the killer was surprising, if perhaps a bit improbable, the book itself was ultimately forgettable."
4,Agatha Christie's A.B.C. Murders,"In my opinion, this was one of Agatha Christie's best mystery stories. In this story she brings back Hercule Poirot and Captain Hastings to solve a mystery together. They must stop a serial killer. This killer is killing people in alphabetical order. Hercule Poirot receives notes from the killer in advance notice of the date of each murder. The killer adds the date and location of the murder in all his notes. Hercule Poirot arrives at the crime scene always too late. The killer always leaves a railway guide beside each body telling Hercule Poirot where the next murder will take place and at what time. The killer has already murdered up to letter ""C"". It is up to Hercule Poirot and Captian Hastings to stop the serial killer from getting to the letter ""D"". The plot of the story is very suspenseful and the ending is surprising."
3,"an ok book, average","Hercule Poirot is the main detective in a murder mystery where there is a murderer on the loose. This murderer is on a killing spree killing people in alphabetical order. The killer is leaving clues behind him on where he will strike next. Hercule Poirot, with the help of Hastings and Japp, travel throughout england to stop this ruthless killer. If your into murder mystery books this is one of the books to choose. I would'nt recomend you buy this book but I do recomend you go to your nearest library and get it on audio. It's only 3 hours long!"
4,Completely unexpected twist!,"As an avid fan of Agatha Christie's Hercule Poirot, I entered into ""The ABC Murders"" with high expectations. Those expectations, I felt, were quickly dashed. The books became more about the narrative of a detective investigating a case than an attempt to solve the mystery oneself. I was all set to give this book only a couple of disappointed stars, but the twist at the end made it all worthwhile. Christie does a truly marvelous job of manipulating the reader, leading you where she wishes you to go. If you find yourself doubting & second-guessing this book, take my advice: read to the end; it's worth it!"
5,Original entry in the Poirot series,"The plot for this book could not be more unusual -a killer who selects victims in alphabetical order! There appears to be no connection between any of the victims other than that the first letters of their names form an alphabetical sequence. Can the killer be a madman and what is the reason for his fixation? Poirot as usual is the middle of things, since the killer keeps writing him taunting letters before and after each crime. But that is where the murderer has made a mistake because Hercule Poirot is determined to get to the bottom of this mystery...An excellent book that is well plotted and pulls the different threads of the mystery together much more logically than in some of Christie's other works. Another nice touch is the return of Captain Hastings from South America, just in time to help solve the mystery. I feel that Poirot is really at his best with Hastings around to serve as the perfect foil. Great fun and a holding read."
3,Weak!,"A slow, bloated, overdrawn example of a total Sherlock Holmes rip-off. Christie relies to heavily upon the charm of her detective to keep the reader interested, hoping they won't notice the slow, rather dull plotline. The characters other than Poirot are paper-thin. When an author can't make a delusional psychopath interesting, you start to wonder if it's worth the effort."
4,Clever twist,"A clever twist, which has been much copied by others, makes this a well worth read. Not the most outstanding of Christie's novels, the characters are a bit too wooden, and it is never exactly clear why Poirot recruits the families of the victims as fellow sleuths, but it might just steal a place in the top 20."
5,Comedy and Suspense,"All of Agatha Christie's mysteries are well-crafted and suspenseful. This one, however, also manages to be very funny. Don't get me wrong, -- it's no comedy -- however Poirot's perpetual sidekick Hastings is at his best here. There are many funny moments with Poirot, Hastings, Inspector Japp, and another cocky inspector whom Poirot is forced to work with. I don't want to give anything away, but I will say that the story is quite unpredictable. When Christie strays from blood-curdling terror, she is a very witty comic writer."
5,Defininetly one of her best,"One of Agatha Christie's greatest books in my opinion. As in all of her books, there is a mind boggling plot and ending. It is the endings of her books that set her far above most other writers. This book was particularly satisfying because even as you near the end, there are still ironic twists and turns in the plot and detective's investigation. The detail in which she unravels the solution is even more gripping. I could not put this book down until the final page."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Bump 'em off in order, see if I don't then.The murderer in this case sends one Hercule Poirot advance notice in the form of letters of what he intends to do, and it seems he is perhaps loopy enough to have come from Arkham.His string of killings follows the alphabet by place and by name of the deceased.Poirot will strain his grey matter to work this one out.3 out of 5"
4,There is no one like...,"Christie.This book started a little slow, but soon picked up the pace. It's about a murderer who tells Poirot where the murder will take place but Poirot never seems to be able to get there on time. But, Poirot waits until the murderer makes a mistake. I know this is redundant but; the clues are there to point you in the right direction, but as usual unless you're POIROT u aren't gonna solve it."
4,exciting,"though this book is nto as good as 'and then there were none' it had me hooked after a few chapters, the surprise ending was very amusing and the way she makes you think ""oh this one was easy to figure out"" and then at the end you realize you were wrong, she never fails!"
4,This book was a suspenseful and exciting story.,"The book THE ABC MURDERS was an exciting and suspenseful story, about a murderer who killed his victims according to an alphabetical pattern. This story is one of the ""best"" I've ever read, and combines an excellent narrative with exciting events. I would recommend this book to people who like mystery and murder stories, since it is a combination of both."
4,One of Christie's Better Ones,"Agatha Christie's mysteries are always at least very good. This one is excellent.Poirot and Hastings are back together in this mystery. The book starts with Poirot receiving a note indicating that something will happen to someone whose name begins with ""A"" in Andover on a given date. The something of course is murder and the chase is on as the murderer proceeds deeper and deeper into the alphabet.Atypical of Christie's works is that the murderer calls his shots in advance. As can be expected, there is the typically fine sleuthing. Unexpected, however, best describes the ending.A fun read and highly recommend. Poirot is at the top of his game and is his usual immodestly engaging self."
4,Agatha Christie is the Queen,"It is difficult to write a review of Christie's work, as any hint of the plot could give away a clue. So I'll just say that this is one of her best. I liked it better than ""And Then There Were None,"" but not quite as well as ""The Clocks"". This book didn't have as much suspense as that novel; there was quite a bit of lag time. Christie's detective, Hercule Poirot, is annoying until you get used to him, which I am starting to, so first time Christie readers may like to start off with a non-Poirot novel.I read Christie hoping to really unravel the mystery everytime before it is revealed. Once again, Christie beat me to it! Enjoy..."
4,ATTENTION!,"I think that this was a good book. It really caught my attention,so I was able to complete the whole book. It was very detailed and the killer was not revealed until the end. Attention Attention read all about it ""THE PATRIOTIC MURDER"" is a great book."
4,AN excellent mystery!,"I'm a big fan of Agatha Christie's books, especially the Poirot mysteries. The first one I read, Murder in Mesopotamia, got me hooked, and now I've read almost all of her books. They always keep me guessing, and there are just about two books in which I knew who the murderer was. ABC murders is not one of them, so I really liked it. My personal favorites, though, are Murder on the Links, Five Little Pigs, and The Murder of Roger Ackroyd. My least favorite ones are Big Four, Hickory Dickory Death and Curtain (Hercule Poirot fans may know why). I would recommend any Hercule Poirot mysteries any day!"
4,Good book. Worth to read.,This book is good in sense that everything has been plot well. Note for the reader that the one who appears to be the murder is not but the murder is the other one we are familiar with.
2,Handle lost grip easy,"Although the 2 section is good as it allows to fix a small towable, the handle lost the grip easy.After 3 rounds I had to glue the grip again, and every 3 days I had to do it again. The grip is glued on the wrong side, having the seam toward the dragging line, here when the rope and handle is in the water being towed by the boat, the water rips the grip out of the handle.The color received is not the one n the pictures (I got a black and white one)."
1,"Don't write another book, please","Bob should stay to training horses, this book is poorly organized and written on a grade school level. I have never been so annoyed with the writing in a book, he uses ""I"" constantly. The content is shallow and gives the reader no further insight into the high end racing world."
4,Bob Baffert - The Boy - The Man,"The BAFFERT book is an easy read and actually gives you a bit of a feel for the man, the horse racing industry (mostly thoroughbred), and its players thru 1999.It sometimes seems the book is meant to be cathartic, as Bob fairly candidly relates a number of mistakes (as well as good decisions) he has made with horses and clients over the years; still the book helps you to appreciate the little boy personae so evident in the successful man who's central to nearly every major horse racing event today.Although the book was published in 1999, a number of the people and horse bloodlines are still relevant as I write this review in April 2006."
5,"A Delightful Journal, Quintessentially Early American","This marvelous anthology of American music from the years 1750-1850 ranges from early patriotic songs to dances to anthems by the likes of William Billings, all rendered with exceptional skill by the dependable Waverly Consort, whose performances pretty much never fail to satisfy me. Most of the selections are songs, sung for the most part by a chorus with an occasional vocal solo. Accompaniment varies from just percussion to small ensemble that includes lute, bass viol, banjo, flute, recorder, harp and dulcimer, among others. The dance pieces are actually some selections form Playford's English Dancing Master. This is a bit more than fifty minutes of stirring and atmospheric Early Americana, not to be missed."
5,Fig 6.,"Awesome cd,anyone who knows anything about music has this cd in their collection. One of the greatest EP's I've ever listened to."
4,Excellent overview of this topic,"This is an excellent book for the beginning information literacy professional. Not only do the authors discuss background and points of view that you should consider when working with faculty on IL programs, but many sample materials are reproduced that you can easily tailor to your situation.Brief discussions of the types of surveys and programs you can implement are included, as well as ways to promote an IL program with your faculty and students.Overall, an excellent and practical overview of the topic."
5,"Wonderful, sensitive playing....","Ah, reader, consider this album. I have been listening to Bayless music for years, from Bach Meets the Beatles to his crazy happy birthday album in a dozen styles (Stravinsky's Rite of Birthday, a favorite), but this one has something special going on. The playing is so beautifully, and sensitively played that one is really swept away by the original movie tune, interwound with a classical piece, so seamless and amazing. One of my all-time favorite albums."
5,buy it,"Hands down one of the best pop-neuro books I have ever read. I'm working on a PhD in neuroscience and while this book obviously does not contain any of the molecular biology relevant to my career, I re-read it continuously.I'm somewhat of a connoisseur of pop-neuro books, having read well over 100 of them in the past four years. And the only book that compares with in terms of overall quality is Ian Glynn's Anatomy of Thought.Whether you are in the field or not, you should find Ratey's book to be an enjoyable read."
5,Excellent material,"This is by far one of the best books i have read in my life, it explains everything so easy that you actually understand what is going on inside your head. it has many real cases that show the application of what he just told you. if you are thinking to buy this book, dont think, just buy it."
3,Good in parts but flawed,"Summary:1. Tedious writing style - too verbose.2. Hard to distinguish opinions of the author from what has been established scientifically.3. Repeats - obviously without checking - the feminist lie that there was a ""Rule of Thumb"" which permitted men to beat their wives with a stick no thicker than their thumb. This casts doubt on his credibility.4. I stuck it out to the end because there was enough useful information to keep me going. Next time I would advise the author to get a ghost writer and have someone check the facts for him."
1,A Users Guide To The Brain,"As someone living with hydrocephalus for almost 40 years and as the p.r. director for the Hydrocephalus Support Group/Seattle, I take issue w/Mr. Ratey's definition of hydrocephalus and how his misconceptions of the condition are presented here as fact. In fact, they are fiction. There are millions of us who live very full lives with little or no mental impairment from hydrocephalus or having a shunt. Sadly, there are still those, like Mr. Ramey, who insist on perpetuating myths and misconceptions of what hydrocephalus is and how incompatable it is with a functional life!"
1,too verbose,the introduction alone was enough to make me return this book. this author writes extremely long winded setences and does not make good use of his commas. the sentences are so verbose that the i found myself reading them mutliply times and placing my own commas and periods where necessary. reading this book reminded me of the days i had to read my biochemistry textbooks for a college class. his writing style does not belong in a consumer book.
1,DO NOT BUY...,This book is full of ignorance. Read anything but what this manipulative author puts forth in his books.
3,Love the teapot - hate the pour,"I love my little squirrel teapot, but it doesn't pour well. If you are more into collecting unique teapots, this is great. But, to use it daily, it doesn't pour well, runs down the side and goes everywhere."
1,Can't record a thing on these. My Staples CD-RW work fine,Bought these thinking they would be better for audio CD's. Should have read the reviews first. So far wasted up 5 of the 25. May try them for data CD's to get some of my money back.Avoid these unless you have a stand-alone recorder.
5,A Must Have for Serious Readers of Poetry,This book (the first volume) is over 600 pages. And they are 600 pages chock full of intelligent analyses and overviews of all the poetic schools in Britian and the US since the 1890s. This book is fascinating in its content and a joy to read because of Perkins' clear and humane style. It is amazing that one person can know so much. But don't let that intimidate you. This book will do wonders for your working knowledge of American and British poetry.
5,awesome product,bought this for a friend. she loves it. never knew what it was but shes got me wanting one of my own. thank you for having one and giving me a chance to learn about taco holders... i seriously never knew about them.frustrated with amazon as this is the fifth review ive left for this fantastic item.
3,why did I get this???,"I thought it would be useful when preparing tacos but in the end, it turned out to be totally useless. I am not using it and it probably will end up in the donations bag one of these days."
4,Very useful Kitchen Device for Taco Lovers!,Lightweight but sturdy.Makes filings tacos so much easier and faster.The only flaw is that the rubber handles aren't oven safe.All in all a worthwhile purchase.
3,"taco,taco,taco","Well, it works. It's long, longer than a cookie sheet, but it works. They should send a taco serving platter with this. It is cheap enough to buy and it does hold taco's well."
1,Don't work well!,"These cones have a huge seam on one side that causes the henna to come out in a flat ribbon instead of a round strand. I asked for a return and they said to try cutting off more of the tip (but I wanted a thin strand so that wouldn't work) or taping the seam down. I tried the tape and it was better but still didn't come out in a nice round shape. For example, I couldn't make nice round dots with it. Then they said I could return it, but I had to pay the postage. Don't buy these."
2,"scratchy, not soft like previous hanes","i've buying hanes cotton panties for many years. i was looking forward to some new underwear, threw these in the wash as soon as they came in the mail, am very disappointed - very scratchy, not soft like all the previous hanes cotton undies i've purchased. would return if i could and it was worth the time and expense. also i saw these in a local drugstore after i had placed my order for less than i paid online. will not buy again from hanes."
3,Detailed and theoretical,"As a beginning mediator, I found this book very detailed and theoretical. I am sure that I will return to it again and again as I gain experience. I found ""Basic Skills for the New Mediator (2d edition)"" by Allan H. Goodman to provide a quicker and more practical overview. When used together, I believe both books are a good basis for the practicing mediator."
3,Helps with heartburn but...,"...wasn't quite the ""silver bullet"" that I was hoping for. I tried it every other day for several weeks, as the directions suggest, but saw only a moderate reduction in my heartburn symptoms."
1,Did Not Even Make a Dent,Perhaps this product works for others but it did not work for me. I took it according to instructions and there was no difference in the intensity or frequency of heartburn.
1,Do Not Purchase This,"This is the worst, it does nothing but increase the pain you have. I do not reccomend this product for heartburn relief."
2,Did not work for me,"I have had heartburn since I was 13. This is a family thing. I wanted to get off the proton pump inhibitor because of the side effects. Unfortunately, Heartburn Free did not work for me, I had hoped it would. Perhaps it would work for someone who has not had heartburn for a very long time."
1,Not Good,"Leave it to Thomas Hampson and his giant ego to title an album, Leading Man. We all look forward to that day when Hampson wakes up from his reverie and realizes that he cannot sing everything. Here is the album that states the case emphatically that Opera singers have no business singing American Musical Theater. Particularly Opera singers who THINK they CAN sing this repertoire. Hampson's indulgent, charicatured, pompous and bloated renderings of this strong material is an embarassment. His performance of ""Not A Day Goes By"" is painful, and for all the wrongs reasons. He uses his celebrated falsetto to mamby-pamby effect in ""Bring Him Home"", a song written for the tenor voice. Maestro Raitt must have cringed while recording ""Hey There"". Too bad Hampson couldn't learn from one of the true Giants of American Musical Theater. If you want a good laugh, or cry, purchase this album. Don't say you weren't warned."
2,"Not Great,","Too loud and ""rocky"" for Christmas music. Lyrics unintelligble with mumbling and loud screaming. Miss Terry Kath on this one. Will try another for next year"
5,"A bit untraditional, but unbelievably awesome","There really isn't a whole lot I can say about this CD as it more or less speaks for itself. If you like jazzy, modern renditions of Christmas music, this is as good as it gets. If you like Chicago, this is also pretty darned good. Quite honestly, the re-recording of ""Jolly Old St. Nicholas"" featured on this album is almost worth the cost alone."
2,Chicago takes the cheap road ... again,"Chicago - their incredible catalog of music has provided a whole gamut of enjoyable music throughout the years. However, in the last couple of years, the band has steered away from recording new music and instead focused exclusively on selling old music to old fans by including a couple of new songs.""What's It Gonna Be Santa"" is the same old. It's Chicago XXV (originally released in the summer of 1998), being reissued for the fourth time. This time, they've added six new songs to ensure that you'll repurchase the other 12 songs you already bought when you picked up Chicago 25 in any of its other incarnations. The cover is new, the title is new, there's a couple of new songs, but it's still Chicago 25, not a new album."
3,Not a jacket!,The picture is deceiving...it looks like a jacket is included but it is actually a vest.
3,A sad tale,"This is not a very uplifting movie, but one that makes us realize how differently we all deal with tragedy, grief and loss. Some can quickly move on with their lives while others let the death of a loved one become the death of themselves. the film also shows how helpless one can feel when a friend is in such a profound state of grief. Whether you admire or detest the main character, this movie is in a category by itself and is one that you remember."
5,The perfect Christmas gift!,"I've already purchased 7 copies of My Mother's Notebook. These will make great Christmas gifts from my own mother and aunt whom I intend to have fill out the areas left blank and pass down to the children and grandchildren. I can already imagine the fun at Christmas of everyone discussing new things they will have learned about my mom and aunt! i.e. first loves, words of wisdom, lessons learned, favorite scents, phrases and customs that have disappeared, and much more nostalgia. A great gift to bring families together!"
4,Just right...,"Just what I needed to complete the restoration of my Jeep. It takes a little practice to get tape this wide on without air bubbles underneath, but it looks great when you finally get it right."
4,12 Fold Power Soul DVD-Set,"Length:: 2:33 MinsThe Twelve Fold Power Soul is an awesome power packed Set of DVD's! Each DVD has a step by step guide for a Powerful Meditation. Each DVD allows for an individual to focus on a color sphere representing the Disciple and its' principle power. The chromatic visual is something to behold! The meditation is tricky but with practice one can master it. However, I've learned to hold the sphere in my mind's eye..... Now What? There has to be a part two to this....... When will it be available? This clip is a shortened version of approximately 20 minutes of video. Therefore the clip is a little choppy. But I hope you get a feel for the real product. This is something else.The Twelve Fold Power SoulGlenny"
2,About as deep as a puddle,"I respect Vanessa-Mae as an artist who has attracted public interest to the versatility of the violin in multiple genres. However, for a classically trained violinist, she seems to have forgotten her roots. While she demonstrates nearly flawless technique, that's pretty much all there is. Brief glimpses of musicality are its only saving grace. The Bach, especially, is excrutiatingly shallow. There's just not much to it. It is very immature for her supposed musicality. If you're looking for good unaccompanied Bach, try Heifitz-- a phenomenal standard --or even Hilary Hahn (her Bach is strikingly intuitive, despite her youth).Bottom line: She sounds bored, which makes it boring. If you're a hardcore V-M enthusiast, stick with the original, fiery, vamped-up Vanessa-Mae."
2,She's in over her head,"While these are not horrible performances, they are exceedingly shallow. Vanessa-Mae clearly has no understanding of how one is supposed to build and shape a piece of music. This is particularly apparent with the Bach Partita, where one cannot rely on spiffy orchestration to save one's [...] --- it's just the violinist and the music, and it's up to the performer alone to make the music speak to the audience.In this performer's hands, the music simply drifts along without direction or focus. Clearly there is no musical maturity here. For those apologists who would say, ""but she was only 17 when she recorded it,"" I would reply that she should do her musical growing up before stepping into a recording studio. Besides, I thought she was supposed to be a prodigy. This doesn't sound prodigious, only lackluster."
1,No Sense of classics,I was lucky to have not wasted any buck on it.Thanks for the lovely service!the sample of 1 minute aimless lousing on note leaded me to an immediate decision.
2,"well lady, could you go back and practise?","i do not mean she's bad, while any academic student could play like this. one could play down from classical to pop, and a pop star could use classical as a flavor; while now you started from below. if you go on like this, i'm just afraid that neither your pop fans nor any classical fans would stick on you. in addition, people would continuosly recall these ""similarities"" between you and pagnini as mentioned by advertisements, so, please, have more practices. one day, as you no longer have to struggle to play bach's partitas, hopefully you could be re-recognized as a moderate player, though i don't think that's the right way for you to go. why not go on with your commercial performances? don't get ashamed, there would be people like that, even if i'm not one of them."
5,Its everything it says it is,"It makes me want to put my keys up to my CBR 900, and play all day. The moto cross is awesome. The graphics are great. Another great game from infro."
3,Just isn't what i thought it would be.,"i saw the commercial for this game and immediately bought into the hype thinking it would be the most entertaining game for me since Driver, but after plying for about an hour, found it to be a huge let-down. Maybe i'm just not a big enough video game jockey, but i really would reccommend that any prospective buyers RENT this game first."
3,"Nautica Jeans Cargo Pants in Canvas, 32",The overall quality and appearance of the pants was very nice. I did not like that I did not get to choose the length and therefore I had to pay to have the pants hemmed.
3,Oddball attempted tribute,"As a tribute goes, this doesn't truly give credit to that iconic Dunedin band, The Clean, who with the Chills and others defined the Dunedin sound. Head Like a Hole's cover of Beatnik is quite good but otherwise you're better going to the real thing."
4,"About 1"" too long","Excellent quality hose, was about 1"" too long for my 2008 Forester. When I test fit the hose, the hose kinked a bit. Trimmed a bit off of each end and it fit just like the OEM hose. The hose was the correct shape, would recommend keeping the packing slip and marking which hose is the top and bottom. They are almost identical on the Forester."
5,Fits very well!,I bought this for my Avalanche and I have to say it fits very well on the windshield. I should have gotten this a long time ago.
2,With great pain I rate it two stars...,"The producer team of George YOung and Harry Vanda came back for ""Blow Up Your Video"", and they truly succeeded in giving the band a raw, typical AC/DC sound reminiscent of the ""Let There Be Rock"" album.The ten songs are generally good, according to AC/DC standards. The beat is steady and strong, courtesy of Simon Wright,a totally different drummer than Phil Rudd; Cliff Williams's bass reached an all time low in the final mix, you can't barely hear it. Johnson's vocals never sounded so bad, totally obscured in the back of the mix, as if singing from another room ina big house. Very weird. The tunes, however, are definitely very good. (I'll not talk about the lyrics, because, just when you think these guys, without Bon Scott, are beginning to be capable of writing better lyrics than ""sex, sex, sex"", how theyhad demonstrated in ""FLICK OF THE SWITCH"", they go back to the silliest lyrics ever.)"
2,The one i care the less...,"I love all the albuns from AC DC with BON SCOTT...The albuns with Brian Johnson are good, i really like Back in Black, FLICK OF THE SWITCH and FOR THOSE ABOUT TO ROCK...But after Back in Black, the AC DC albuns start to bring a lot of filler songs! Blow Up Your Video in my opinion is the one with more fillers and maybe only 2 decent songs, That's the way and Heatseeker! Well, every great band got uninspired moments in their career..."
1,AN ALL TIME LOW,"AC/DC reached an all time low in this one. With VBand and Young again in produuction, this was not enought to release at least an average AC/DC albu, but the worst of them all ever."
4,Don't listen hoping for Back In Black,"The songs are great on here but much like Fly On The Wall - it's the production that hurts the album. It's better than Fly in that aspect but not by much. That's a shame because Brian's voice was still in top shape here.It's no Back In Black but it's not trying to be. Great stuff on here - Heatseeker, That's The Way, Meanstreak, Ruff Stuff."
3,Headbanger and rockin',"AC/DC keeps with their formula...you like them, tolerate them or hate them, but you know what you are going to get with them - ROCK!"
3,AC/DC's lost effort,"If there ever was an AC/DC album that could be considered a lost effort, ""Blow Up Your Video"" would be just that. Actually, it's not a bad album(therefore the middle rating), but the creative level on here gets a bit pitiful at times. The reason for this is incredibly weak choruses--which I believe are a strength for AC/DC. Besides the choruses, that's the only problem. Some of Angus and Malcolm's guitar work on here is downright nasty and chock full o' grooves!Weak tracks include: ""Go Zone,"" ""Ruff Stuff,"" ""Sin for Nuthin,"" and possibly ""Nick of Time."" As I said before, these tracks are strong with their guitar licks, but have really awful chorus.Stand-outs include: ""Heatseeker,"" ""That's the Way I Wanna Rock N' Roll,"" ""Meanstreak,""(my fav), ""Kissin Dynamite,"" and ""This Means War."""
4,Not the best....but good,"This album isn't as bad as people say. If you like AC/DC then you'll like the album. ""Heatseeker"", ""That's the way I wanna Rock n' Roll"", ""Meanstreak"", ""GoZone"", and ""This Means War"" are all classic AC/DC songs. Pick up this album if you get the chance."
4,FINE ALBUM WITH A COUPLE OF WEAK PARTS,"This is a really good AC/DC album with great tracks like HEATSEEKER, SOME SIN FOR NUTHIN', RUFF STUFF & TWO'S UP. It also contains one of the worst AC/DC songs in GO ZONE. The rest is okay to good."
3,Grade C+,"AC/DC has always had a problem of their music sounding like music off any other of their cds, with lyrics changed. You get the same feeling upon listening to this cd. But this time around, unlike their last 2 studio cds, they have more than one good song on the cd, they have 3. THIS MEANS WAR, THAT'S THE WAY I WANT TO ROCK-N-ROLL, and HEATSEEKER. This time also Johnson, sounds like he is singing with the gusto of his first two cds with the band. Prodution is also better on this cd. But for the rest of the cd, same old AC/DC."
4,Good Music is Timeless...,15 yrs old and one of the better albums they produced. Yes I said it! This IS one of the three or four best albums that AC/DC ever made.
3,Better than I expected,"To be honest, I thought this was a decent one. After listening to ""For Those About to Rock,"" where I think they went a tad overboard, I found this one to have some better rhythms. Brian Johnson seems to be at his best when he has something with a good beat, which most of the songs on ""For Those About to Rock"" seemed to lack (a lot of slow, droning anthemic rhythms on that one). This one has some good riffs throughout, and while it's no BIB, I did find myself enjoying it quite a bit, surprisingly. The first 2 songs are the best, but the first 4 are actually all rather solid in my opinion, and there isn't a loathsome moment here as on other albums. The final song was probably my least favorite, but it certainly didn't make me cringe the way other songs have.For an album of the Brian Johnson era, I like this one. I'd say give it a listen. These lesser known albums aren't too expensive and this one is worth the purchase."
3,let's get it straight,"Ok, let's be rational here. Of course this is not Back in Black, nor Highway to Hell.....maybe the Young brothers are not very proud of this one, but one star?? C'mon, let's get serious...it was 1988 !!!!!!!!!!!!!! Judas Priest had Ram it Down (ugghh!!), Ozzy released the mediocre No rest for the wicked, Van Halen slaughtered us with OU812 and everybody was starting listening to rap!! Believe me, this was a jewel in his time."
5,Quite good! Way good! Too Good! Cool Man!,"Perlman did a very good job pulling off the klezmar. His classical style does show through. A bit to much vibrato, but he did a very nice job."
2,Fiddler's Delight,"I used this CD as background music at a recent Seder Meal. It's not a piece that I would otherwise use, but served the purpose well in this setting."
5,In the Fiddler's House,"Perlman at his best. If you want to buy just one CD with Perlman performing, this is it."
3,CODA HAS AGED BETTER OVER THE YEARS,"The problem with CODA was that the collection felt like outtakes when it was released. The re-assessment of Zeppelin has made many of CODA's tracks more appreciated. Still, the main problem with CODA isn't so much with the individual songs -it's with the mix.The songs here just don't sound as good as they should because it's so assorted. To fully appreciate these tracks, buy Zep's 4 CD Remasters set. Somehow the magic of Zeppelin isn't captured here, except with ""I Can't Quit You Babe"" - an edited version from the Albert Hall concert in 1970.Only hardcore Zep fans should get this..."
2,Doesn't Compare,"This doesn't compare to any of the other Zeps. Of course it can't because it is just a bunch of outtakes, though it still has some good songs like ""Wearing and Tearing."" This should not be your first Zep album, but if you have all the others, I'd go for it. After all, bad Led Zeppelin is better than most else."
4,Coda,"I am a really big Zep fan. I really fell in love with this album. The song We'er gonna Groove is great. I dont know why this was not on one of there albums. It is a shame that this is the only cd. I can find it on. I Cant Quit you was great as well. I have heard around 11 versins of this song and well, this is the best. It was really just a sound check that they were doing before there concert. This is a great album and is a lot of fun to listen to. Jimmy Page was not on the top of his game when some of the stuff was recorded,, but give him a break,, he is the best even when he is not on. Jimmy Page is in my opinon, one of the top 10 guitar players in rock history. I know you will love this. PS. Please by all the Led Zeppelin records that you can, because Maria Carry has sold just a few million records more than Zeppelin. I hate that. It just goes to show you that people dont know where it is at any more. Give It Back to rock and roll!"
2,the last poor career ZEPPELIN!,"This last album is for ZEP completist only. the band did alot of musical direction without taking any noticement of the early albums. The new version of I can't quit ya baby had been appeared in the 1st ZEP album. Poor Tom has been appeared as a single in the early 70's but never been released on Cd or LP. Some times I dunoo understand why some fanatical said that this band is the best on ein rock history, Plant has lost his voice in the last 15 years, since he reunited again with PAge on Wlaking in to clarksdale. is Led Zeppelin the best rock band of all time? you can answer it by your selves!!"
4,Worst Doesn't Necessarily Mean Bad,"It's not bad. I understand those that think this album is great and those that think that it's not so great; they're both right. The first side contains some really good live cuts, ""We're Gonna Groove"" and ""Can't Quit You Baby"", and two decent songs.(""Poor Tom"" and ""Walter's Walk"")The second side sounds like an unpolished, yet harder rocking ITTOD. I would of rather seen ""Ozone Baby"", ""Darlene"", or especially ""Wearing and Tearing"" replace tracks 4 -6 on ITTOD. ""W&T;"" kicks major [behind]! My biggest complaint about the entire album is ""Bonzo's Montreaux"", I understand that drum solo's are take'em or leave'em, but the synth programs are just too much.I actually prefer most of these tracks over some of the [stuff] that was on ITTOD (aka ""Carouselambra""). While definetly Zep's worst, it's still a decent CD. Not a great classic, but something different to pop in every once in a while."
3,For those who are real Zep fans,This the last of the 70's genre of real rock 'n' roll. when the world lost Bonzo they lost a piece of history. By far this album is not the greatest however it is truly unique a good buy for the true fan not just the people with Led Zepplin IV and II
3,"Well, it's LED ZEPPELIN...","Of course, this is LED ZEPPELIN and most of the songs on CODA are way way better than most anything in the world of music...but this is trully the last Led album to hear after all the other masterpieces...this is a compilation of nice songs, but only if you already love LED ZEPPELIN..."
3,"Leftovers can be tasty, but not always","Led Zeppelin / CODA: Zep's version of an `odds and sods' album, this is just ok. It has a few interesting tracks but nothing essential.The version of the album in the Complete Albums box set has a few bonus tracks which makes it more appealing.This one gets Three Stars"
5,Led Zeppelin's Coda,"Led Zeppelin acomplished so many things in their career they released this not too long after John Bonhams death. The band had called it quits and figured to release this with studio recordings, and outtakes. I bought this not too long ago at Fye Music for a great price. I have to say I dont listen to this as much as my other Led Zeppelin CD's but I still love it. I love to listen to Led Zepppelin's studio recordings as well as their live recordings so this CD soothed me well. I love the version of I Cant Quit You Baby on this CD its very powerful. I also love Wearing And Tearing without a doubt this is one of the best Zep Cds. This is up to a true Zep fan either buy this and be satisfied or dont and miss out. So Enjoy!"
4,"And lastly, CODA.","As a collection of songs, CODA has some great tracks. The version of ""I Can't Quit You Baby"" is astonishing. ""Poor Tom"" and ""Darlene"" are also both worth having. ""We're Gonna Groove"" is alright-it has some nice effects by Page. ""Walter's Walk"" has a nice groove itself, and ""Ozone Baby"" is an average but catchy song. ""Wearing and Tearing"" is a bad attempt at punk and Bonham's skills are more entertainingly exhibited on ""Moby Dick"" than on ""Bonzo's Montreux."" If you buy every other Zep album and like them, buy this. GET THIS LAST."
4,Essential for true LZ fans.....,"Not for the casual LZ listener, but definitely has something to offer LZ enthusiasts. Obviously this is not their greatest material, but songs like Poor Tom, Ozone Baby, and Wearing and Tearing are good enough to warrant buying."
5,suprise - good,"it's good, buy it...i didn't see any real hits so i didn't buy it at first, but when i did - i didn't regret it."
3,A Final Offering to Salivating Fans (2.5 STARS),"The entire world was shocked to hear about John Bonham's alcohol-related death. The rest of Led Zeppelin said that they knew they were done instantly after it happened; they refused to find a new drummer. But the band was kind enough to put out some unreleased material shortly after the tragic incident.Of course, they knew as we know now, that it wouldn't be a classic... or excellent... or even good... it's decent. A five star album out of ten, which isn't terrible; there's some good music and I'm glad I have the album. ""Poor Tom"" is a great song. Same with Bonham's drumming on ""Bonzo's Montreaux."" The other six songs are okay, but nothing really essential. But that wasn't the purpose for ""Coda's"" extrication. It's to let fans have a little bit of dessert after the full-blown meal of IV's, II's, Houses of the Holies, and Physical Graffities. Thank you boys."
2,... bad album!,"I give this album three star because I have my own reason,...the whole songs have no inspiration anymore, and most serious of all that this album was released in 1981 after the bad had splited,.....WHY? The only one songs I have loved were Bonzo's montreaux and I cannot quit ya baby. Perhaps Jimmy Page needed money for his tax revenue office?? If this band had been called the best one in the rock history, they should have released the good one last album,..but not like this!"
2,This is simply not very good,"This album is listenable. That's about the most I can say for it. Poor Tom is an excellent song, and I can't understand why it was left off of Led Zeppelin III. The rest of the songs on the album are just not very good. They're not TERRIBLE but they don't feel like real Zeppelin at all. As has been said previously, don't buy this album unless you have bought everything else in Zep's catalog and feel the need to complete your collection."
2,Some things should stay unreleased,"Buy this for two songs: ""We're Gonna Groove"" and ""Poor Tom"". I don't like the rest, though it's interesting to hear outtakes from ""In Through The Out Door""."
2,"Coda = End, Finito","Zep fans, as I, probably expected more here and after years of waiting to purchase, it was a letdown...the band was going through the motions I felt and not exploring."
3,3 = good,"Like others say, listen to the 8 studio albums first. If you want more, then get Coda. About as entertaining as much of the work on their last two albums, and more entertaining than the solo material I've heard.The box set version of Coda includes the single ""Hey Hey What Can I Do"", a good idea."
3,Good.,"This is it. The final bang of Led Zeppelin. Sadly, time has not aged well on this album. All of it is leftovers that don't really have the power of the old stuff. And that's ok. Wearing And Tearing was the only thing that blew me away. Not much, though. Very simple, and yes, there's a great outtake of ""I Can't Quit You Baby."" That alone is worth the price. Ok stuff."
4,But 4 Led Zeppelin Stars actually equal 5,"I remember clearly when this album came out and people were so down on it since it was culled from out-takes. Reviewers slamed it, radio DJs refused to play cuts. But I bought it and liked much of it. ""Darlene"" is an excellent blues rocker, the kind of tune Robert could sing convincingly. The variety is refreshing, from the funk of ""Poor Tom"" to the kick of ""We're Gonna Groove"" and ""Ozone Baby"". ""We're Gonna Groove"" was recorded at a sound check and gives you an indication of what the band's live sound could be like on a good day - dynamic and hard-edged. If you like Led Zeppelin in general, you'll find something to like here, especially if you liked In Through The Out Door, since three of the songs were from those sessions. ""Wearing and Tearing"" is one of those three and I consider it a classic."
5,Led Zepplin,They were so good at trying different style's of music and exploring different way's to play. They will always the kings of rock.
2,Nothing Extra...,"The music gets 5 stars. Let's face it-(ALL ZEPPELIN MUSIC GETS 5 STARS)! This particular packaging(mini lp)gets 5 stars. There is no new remastering here, so I take away 2 stars. There are no ""extra tracks"", like on the ""CODA"" disc in the ""Complete Studio Recordings"" box set. So, minus 2 more stars. Then, I just HAVE to give back 1 star, again, for the packaging! Sorry, but in mho, mini lp packaging should have been the industry standard, from the beggining!"
2,Unreleased songs should have stayed that way,"So much for the notion that Led Zeppelin may have had a great repository of unreleased songs in their vaults. Their best song not to make it to an album, ""Hey Hey What Can I Do?"" is not even featured on this collection. The songs that appear on this disk are for the most part forgettable. They certainly do not live up to any notions of what classic Led Zeppelin material ought to be."
3,only fool people who said this one is a good one,"the final studio recording with ZEP, and then they had split, of course the die hard and blind fans always said that this album is a good one,....think logically buddy! CODA is not the best of their albumI only like one track bonzo's montreaux in this cd."
2,left over,"it is not neglected, but this album is the last testament of poor Zeppelin,..the only one songs I loved are I can't quit ya baby and bonzo's montreaux. If Zeppelin would be the best rock band, they would not be broken up in 1981."
2,last testament of this band,The only one song I admired was Bonzo's Montreaux (solo drumming Bonham!) the other one symbolized the end of ZEPPELIN as a super group. need I say more?? Thank you!
2,Led Zeppelin at its worst,"Let me say this first: I am a huge Zep fan, they are the best band ever, but this is sooo bad, that I wish they didn't put the name Led Zeppelin on it. I only recommend this album if you are a Zep fan that most own every album, that is the only reason this even got a 2."
1,worst zeppelin album by far,"there is pretty much nothing good out of this zeppelin album, but if your a big fan its a must have."
1,Coda is (or should be) an embarrassment to the band,"Actually I would have given this 0 stars, but the menu didn't allow that. This album should never have been released. No serious Zeppelin fan could enjoy this garbage. A similarly bad album is ""In through the out door"". Led Zeppelin was over after Houses of the Holy. Physical Graffiti was also pretty bad - with the exception of Kashmir (which was probably left over from Houses of the Holy). Too bad the record company felt it necessary to try and make some money off fans who would blindly buy anything with Led Zeppelin's name on it. I don't imagine Amazon is going to post this review - since it certainly won't help to sell any copies of this. At least they let you preview the songs; so don't take my word for it, listen yourself to how bad this stuff is."
3,Zeps Last Goodbye,"I am saddened in writing this even though years have passed since John death brought the band to end their reign of the Master of Rock. Kings? Perhaps. John is missed to this day. CODA was a last treasure released by Led Zeppelin, a compilation of previously unreleased material. Like a ""lets give them the rest"" type deal. many of the songs aren't great but we true Zeo fans never were ones for lacking the desire for wanting anything and everything they did. Not disappointing by no means but it is just a collection of songs over the years that were not put on any other album. I never did understand why the crunge was put out when there were clearly better songs to take its place."
2,Missing Song,"The first time I heard about this album was right after Robert Plant released his 1st solo album. I was anticipating a lot of new material (looking at the track listing on the back record cover). Only to be disappointed at the quality of the songs. Thus with my entire Led Zeppelin collection (I have them all), this is the least played album with the exception of the song ""Wearing & Tearing"".And with a limited amout of studio recording material to put on the album, I was suprised they didn't include ""Hey, Hey, What Can I Do"" which was only released on B side of a 45 RMP record instead of a live version of ""I Can't Quit You""."
2,The leftover bin,"Like most posthumous leftover albums, this one is weak. Not entirely bad, however: on ""Wearing and Tearing"" they proved they could still play fast and heavy, and ""Poor Tom"" and ""Ozone Baby"" are not without their charm. This is definitely not the Zep album to buy first. However, fans will want it to complete their collections."
4,Back to Dance,"This CD has many excellent past tracks which are great remixes for the only one dj Jan Wayne.With perfect effects,great melodies and of course excellent vocals.is the perfect cd for someone who likes trance!!!Don't miss it!It's one of the best trance cds in the world!"
3,Doesn't sound like trance to me,"This is the fist CD that I bought by Jan Wayne. What can I say? It has some great songs, like ""Because the Night"" and ""More than a feeling"", but that is it. For $20+ I wouldn't buy this CD if I were you. You can definitely find something better AND cheaper."
1,It does not work,I made numerous attempts to install WinFax Pro and it did not work. The help screens took me in endless loops back to the starting point. I use Windows 98 and Office 2000.
3,"Good, Bad, Sometimes Ugly","Winfax is a nice bit of programming. On a machine that doesn't spend much time in other communications programs it works great. If your machine, like mine, is packed full of software, Winfax is almost guaranteed to find something to fight with.For me, the solution has been to have one machine that has office products such as Word and Access which also has Winfax. It is pretty reliable. Other machines are very busy watching the web or doing processor intensive tasks. These do not have Winfax. This division of labor has kept fights among the programs to a minimum. And, when I try something new on the Winfax machine, it is easy to find the culprit if things start blowing up."
1,WinFaxLite 4.,"I received my Winfax 4.0 for Christmas. I have uploaded it and to this day I have not been able to fax. Is there anyone out there who can help me? I have not been able to reach any tech support. All phone #s, which are available to me are no longer in service. I have not been able to get any help searching on line."
1,WinFax Pro 10.0,"This product was advertised as being compatible with windows 7, but it was not. I through it in the garbage can."
1,WinFax is not a winner,"Struggle to install, struggle to keep working, some nice features if they will work when you want them.If you can find another program to meet your needs, try it."
1,Modem Problems/Poor customer support.,"I purchased WinFax Pro 10. and installed it on my PC. The nexttime I tried connecting to the internet, I got an error message thatmy modem was tied up by another device(obviously WinFax). They have no free customer support; their support is very expensive. I solved the modem problem by uninstalling WinFax Pro. I will not install it again, as access to the internet is a million times more important to me than using WinFax. A waste of money. Several years ago I used software called QL2FAX and had no problems with it."
4,a great program,"I have not had a single problem with WinFax Pro. After upgrading from WinFax Basic I found everything was much as I had hoped. I was able to make my own fax cover sheets as easily as sending a fax. And sending a fax is as easy as a right click on the file you want to fax! You never need to call up the entire program to send a fax, and after a while you'll find that you will either right click, or do a simple drag-and-drop of the file to the WinFax Depot icon. The hardest thing about Winfax Pro is the book that explains how to do things. The book is very hard to understand, and shows the long way to do the simplest things. Better instructions would give this product a perfect five stars."
5,Simply the best!,"I have had several knives over the years and many Swiss Army types be it Wenger, Victorinox, Buck or some Chinese knockoff. In any case, the tool selection on this knife is simply the best. The Huntsman is a good start but the Huntsman lite really takes it to another level. I have owned mine for approximately a year and it is always on my side. There is not a day that goes by that I do not use it for something. A key feature to this knife is the philips head screwdriver that opens up on the end opposed to the middle section in place of the corkscrew. It also includes a pen and a pin that are not found on the Huntsman. The ruby color is attractive and the LED lite is a handy tool to help round this pocket knife out. The Huntsman Lite will help you out of a lot of tough spots when you didn't have the time to pack your tool box. Don't leave home with out it. I would recommend buying a leather holster for it as it can be a bit awkward in the pocket although doable if need be."
5,Probably the only Swiss Army knife to have,"It actually has a real Phillips driver - enough said. So many of the Swiss army models are annoying - because they are always either missing the Phillips driver, or the cork-screw - this one has it all."
3,Baseball Fan,"This is a collection of movies shot by the players themselves. It's a great look at baseball past....however, I'm not old enough to know who a lot of the players are and it would have more enoyable had the producers added the names of the players."
2,What a marvelous way...,"to make money off of 8mm home movie films!You know, back in the day people used to laugh at how bad home movies were. And they really were pretty bad. Well, these home movies really aren't much better. And the total package is really raunchy.It's sorta neat to see some of the old ballparks and players. For about five minutes. Then the narrator starts to become mega-annoying, and you're wondering just where the heck this stuff is happening and who these people dressed in uniforms are and just why am I being shown poorly-framed movies of a paunchy guy on a fishing boat?It's a surreal experience. If you can accept its surreality and just go with the flow, you might manage to find some sort of enjoyment here. Otherwise... don't bother."
1,You get what you pay for,"I received this product on time as expected. Once I tried to install it in the car I noticed the rotor was cracked, the cap was O.K. I wrote a complain about it to Amazon and was given three options on of those was to get it replaced for free, I chose this. I received the second product and had the same problem.So Amazon service was very good. Product purchased was very low quality. Amazon please check the quality of the products you offer for sale. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BWAK48/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title"
4,"Pretty good, confusing in parts","The Maas salient is truly a forgotten battle. With responsibility of the sector switching from British to US hands, it fell to the Dutch to write the book about the battle. As you might expect, they focus some on the hardships undergone by the Dutch civilians in the area. The book keeps a fairly tight lens on the battle, but it sometimes looses perspective. It's easy to get lost and wonder ""why are they attacking again?"" All in all, it's an interesting book, and recommended for the WW2 history buff who needs another book."
3,Fi-Shock,"Good Product, just wish the click was a little louder, you have to look at the indicators to see if fence is charged, the click it makes can't be heard. I would purchase again."
5,Works great,Used it for about 2 months now. Use it to keep away animals out of the vegetable garden. Didn't want to mess with weaker chargers so I got this charger for medium size garden and it does an excellent job keeping animals away. More powerful than I need but just what I needed to ensure some of the weeds don't short the fence. 3 lights show how much energy is going through the wires which is convenient. The charger also clicks when it discharges to the line. It's not very loud but noticeable. Recommended product.
1,Stay away from Fi-Shock Products,Do not buy Fi-Shock products I used Fi-Shock PT-200 poly wire and it cut my hands no warning on using gloves. The instructions do not tell you how make electrical connection. Made 4 calls to company and sent 4 emails No Help.
1,Bad music badly recorded,"I must disagree 100% with the previous 5 star review. Being Polish and knowing quality Polish folk music, this recording is a disgrace. It is a self-indulgent family recording lacking melody, let alone ""music."" What you do get is a repetitive muffled thumping that looses its beat and alternately speeds up and slows down. Added to that are fiddles (or other string instruments) that saw out a one-note buzz, occassional whistles from family members, and the sound of feet dancing. A lousy listening experience. I took a chance on this one as there were no reviews at the time nor any sound samples and am very disappointed. It isn't even funny as a joke, which is what some people I've exposed this to thought it was."
2,what happen' there?,"Being one of the 125,000 people at the 08/02/03 gig at knebworth i have to say i'm really dissapointed on this album 'cause i was actually waiting to hear the entire concert and remmember being there, it gave me the chills just to heard it but i know it could have been better, i was waiting for a 2 disc with the entire concert or from the 3 days best selection. I wanted to hear the mini Take That reuinio with Mark Owen wich was on the last concert, i was hoping to relive what that saturday in august made me feel and to be able to have it forever now the only thing i have are the memories and the hope of the DVD is better, and as he well said it that day after being hangin' from the celling upside down ""For the next 2 hours your arse is mine"" So the only question is what happen' there!"
5,Magnficent show from the Robster !,"I've seen many live performances of great artists, but Robbie beats them all. Robbie is a first class entertainer, and the mixture of his humour and energetic popsongs makes his concerts an experience you'll never forget. All tracks on this CD are brilliant: from the kickstart ""Let me entertain you"", to the stadion classic sing-along-song ""Angels"". No doubt about it: Robbie Williams is absolutely the best popstar of this decennium."
2,It's ok,"I thought this would prevent the steering wheel from freezing but it really does not help the cold. The finishing on it is not very good so if you run your hand over the wheel while driving, you'd get hurt.......I got nicked....but the pictures of the tweety are very cute. The only reason I didn't return it is coz am lazy!"
5,"tweety products, floor mats, stering wheel cover, and holograph","very good quality, and will give it to my son for Christmas, and know he will agree with me, very happy with both orders i purchased"
3,wheel,I would say find something better.I bought it because I had tweety carpet.carpet looks great but the wheel's yellow park get black within 2 weeks.its not that comfortable either.
5,something smells funny in here......,"The lead 'singer' of the Stinky Puffs is a mere child. Yet his lyics ring with a suprising clarity, belying his years. ""I am gross, I am gross."" ""Buddies aren't butts"" Precocious, indeed. Rest easy, friends, the voice of the next generation has been found. The glory of the Stinky Puffs lies not in their soaring harmonies and intricate guitar work (as one might expect), but rather in their uncanny ability of improvisation. In the liner notes, Simon boasts that most of the lyrics were ""made up on the spot"", though (judging by their depth and magnitude) i find this a little hard to swallow. If life has taught me one thing, it's that genius is not born overnight. Still, the Stinky Puffs (with Simon at their helm) have accomplished in a short time what takes many bands years; The innate ability to know yourself and have confidence in your music. Want music of a caliber like no other? Buy any Stinky Puffs album you can get your hands on. You'll thank me later."
1,Almost a waste of time,"I dont know who actually writes reviews. At least one I can identify from the company Virtual Machine design, the company that sells the integrated development environment UMPS , where Myke Predko is so fond about, and recommends throughout its book. I am only halfway the book, but I have this very strong feeling its a waste of time.It is written in a proza way, just like it pops up in the mind of the author. Skip half the book and read the ""old"" intel datasheet on 8051 for free.The intel datasheet is an excellent example of clear technical writing. I rate this book only one star to get the average ranking down, just as others try to get the ranking up. fair is fair."
2,"Disorganized, Unclear and Wordy","I found the book disappointing because key sections are poorly explained, and the overall poor writiting style, and too diluted technical info.A very critical aspect of learning the 8051 is understanding the instruction set. The author included a fairly large graphic with each instruction that turns out to be a big waste of space because he never explains the graphic well. Luckily, the instruction usage can still be deciphered from his limited verbiage.In addition, the technical info on each page is diluted with non-essential side information that should have mostly been omitted. This is compounded by his overly wordy and disorganized approach to most topics."
1,so poorly written it's agonizing to read,"This book is so poorly written it's agonizing to read. Instead of trying to grasp the intricacies of the 8051, I find myself correcting poorly worded and badly structured sentences. It seems as though it slipped through the editing process and went directly to print. If all of the nonsense drivel were eliminated, the book would be half as thick and probably make more sense. It's as amateurish as a paper describing a high school science-fair project. I don't think I could recommend this book to anyone. I definitely wouldn't recommend it for beginners. And, if a well-seasoned designer wanted to learn how to implement the 8051 into his/her next project, this book is an entire waste of time."
1,Poorly Organized and Shallow,"My neighbors son purchased this book as an intro to the 8051, and then let me read it. I was not impressed. The organization of this book is poor. The examples shallow. It contains a few of the authors pet projects, but little else of substance. It provides enough information to make the instant satisfaction crowd feel they have learned something, but those of us who make our livings writing 8051 applications will tell you that if you want to learn, REALLY LEARN, about the 8051, find a good college level textboox, and work through the chapters. Amazon sells several good choices. Ask your local College for a recommendation."
2,Too many information and not enough knowledge,"This book covers many aspects of the MCU design and interface issues. Both hardware and software have been touched, however, many of them have not been treated to a sufficient level. It would be better to address less issues and but explain them clearly."
2,Don't judge one book by its thickness...,"The author give me an impression that he just started to learn about 8051 right before starting to write this book.In this book, it is not much explanation on the hardware features. Being able to connect to external memory is one of the biggest strength of 8051. Surprisingly, the author failed to eleborate on it. His book on PIC is a great book. However, I think he treats 8051 as PIC, which is not the objective of the 8051 book. The projects included in this book are more like PIC project, where small memory, I/O circuit is needed.However, the programming portion in this book gives rather simple and not bad explanation to assembly language beginner like me. I think that is the only useful part in this book."
3,It laundry detergent,"What can i say it is liquid laundry detergent. It got the clothes clean. The concentrated liquid was nice not having to drop a lot of it in. It got most of the kids clothes clean, but the real dirty one still had to be pretreated to get cleaned."
5,wonderful!,Great music! A master on the fiddle. Heard it at a friends house and had to get it for myself! Moving ballads and great upbeat tunes.
1,Tom Jones 2007 release,"A big disappointment. Still a leterbox, it means 3:4 tv format. No information about it. On purpose?"
3,Dated Film,"I had much better memories of this film than reality as the recent viewing proved. I thought fondly of this film after having seen it in the theatre when it was first released. I recently purchased it as a gift for a friend and we watched it for a current review. I was quite bored for the most part and realized that I confused much of it in my mind with Far From The Madding Crowd, which is a better film."
1,"Worst ""Best"" Picture Oscar Winner Ever!","When you think that ""Lawrence of Arabia"" preceded this and ""My Fair Lady"" followed this it boggles the mind that something as terribly bad as this film could ever be mentioned in the same breath as those two brilliant all-time classics of film. I thought that ""Gigi"" was the worst film ever to win the Best Picture award until I saw this. Much of this film reminded me of the typical Benny Hill comedy and we all know just how ""well"" those jokes have aged over the years.Not only is the film itself extremely mediocre but so is the dvd; the picture quality is extremely poor as this hasn't been restored at all and the sound quality is just as poor in mono. I only hope that the book itself is a lot better than this waste of plastic.Highly NOT recommended except as a cure for severe insomnia!"
2,disappointing,"It was pretty hokey. It's an old movie and the sound, movement are abrupt. Some of the characters are funny. Maybe it's a comedy? I just didn't feel it was an authentic treatment of the novel."
1,A Hit and a Miss,"Tom Jones is one of the greatest movies anda biggest hits ever made. Sadly, this is one of the poorest DVD reproductions of any movie ever made. From start to finish, the brightness is so low that it is difficult to see the action, and several times the video and audio are out of sync. Having waited forty years for the chance to see the movie again, I was hugely disappointed. So I'm not rating the movie (which would get five stars) but the DVD."
2,Tom Jones - spotty transmission,"Movie quality was fine. ( For a 40 yr old movie) but the transmission was very poor. Repeated stops for ""loading"" with problems re-starting at the proper spot. Decidedly lower customer satisfaction on this event.."
1,disappointed,watch this on PC. Reception terrible. Saw Tom Jones when first released. Shameful that you release such a dreadful transmission.
2,Couldn't finish it - What was Academy thinking?,"I picked up this DVD because it won the Best Picture Oscar in 1963. I found it to be trite, boring, and terribly stuck in the 60's. It's hard to imagine how this film won the Best Picture Award over much better films like The Birds, Dr. No, Mad Mad Mad Mad World, Cleopatra, etc.Tom Jones was so bad that I quit watching it half way through. I couldn't see wasting another hour on of my life."
4,an oddly fun movie,"I watched this movie in my Intro to Film class, and I learned that in the time this movie was made, it was revolutionary in its uninhibited style. I liked this movie because it's quirky, thoughtful, and satirical all at the same time, even without any profanity at all."
3,Great movies deserve great mastering,The picture quality of this so terrible- it is a shame that such a classic has not had any attention given to it. The scenes that relied on natural lighting are very dark and some of the scenes have serious color washout.
2,Great film but poor-quality transfer is upsetting,"I purchased this with fond memories of the film, which I know well, and watched it with a friend who had not seen the movie before. As reported, much of the film is too dark to make out what's going on, so I had to explain to my friend what was transpiring on screen. In essence, all the night scenes are in total blackness (in the original, there was enough light to see the action), and even some of the other scenes are also difficult to make out entirely. Shame on the releasing company for putting out this classic film in this sorry condition."
1,Silent in 2012 ???,"The movie DVD is a silent one. The seller never made that clear anywhere that I saw.It was a very good and funny movie with sound, but save yourself feeling dumb by buying a silent film.It is 2012 not back in the 20s with silent films!! I should have asked for a refund. Instead I tossed it!"
1,Extremely Poor Visual Quality,"The visual quality of this DVD is grainy, murky, scratched and wanting....The video I have of this is far superior.....its a great movie but this DVD transfer is very poor...and detracts from the greatness of the movie..."
5,A MASTERPIECE,"I was having a hard time figuring out what to rent in the video store. Then my eyes fell on Tom Jones and I am grateful that I rented it! For the next two hours had I been involved in the story of the playboy Tom Jones, his one love, Sophie Western, and his evil cousin Bifel. Then the next day I went to Amazon and bought the video. Buy this! The scene at the inn between Tom and Mrs. Walters/Jenny is worth it."
5,A great Tom Jones!!,"A great mix of action, mistery, fun, good mood!! The best version of Tom Jones. Very faithful to the novel!!Henry Fielding would be proud of this version of his literary masterpiece!!"
4,Excellent WW2 map,"If you want to do research using old maps, this is helpful. It is a 2 dimensional map.I wanted it for a wall-hanging (e.g. mounted in a frame).The Michelin map is folded, but a little steam ""work"" flattens it nicely.If you are not interested in the historical view of Alsace, this map probably has little value to you.I am an amateur military historian and found the map very useful for reference against various regimental histories (available via the San Jose, CA library).It is an excellent historical check-and-balance map (e.g. some town names have changed, road names, etc. from the mid-twentieth century).Although I have not used it in this way, it is probably very useful as an overlay of modern maps, if you are doing a WW2 tour. It is, of course, a map from that time period, so you would have to cross reference memorials and monuments from a modern map and then find the associated reference on the Michelin map.Pete"
4,Decent bag,"Seems like a decent keyboard bag, haven't had too many chances to use it yet. My only gripe is that there is no regular handle to lift it from in the middle, where the shoulder straps are. Your only option is to use the shoulder straps. The two big pockets are pretty handy for carrying power cords and the sustain pedal."
1,Best product--but don't buy it,I love this product but will not buy it again since I bought the last two they both have broken off at the top and every time I have used it the top keeps breaking off. I can't afford the product any more.
3,"Not terrible, but probably rental material.","Gungriffon Blaze can be pretty fun when the action gets intense, but it's too shallow and too short for my taste. The graphics aren't bad, but they are definitely first-generation PS2 graphics. There are some options for customizing mechs, but they're pretty sparse. It can be hard to figure out exactly what the real objectives are on some of the levels. That can be frustrating. The controls aren't too bad, but they can be a little awkward. Overall, it might be a good rental sometime if you're into mech games, but I wouldn't buy it until it hits the bargain bin."
3,Oh Yeah-Ace,"For being a 1st gen ps2 game ggb is not bad. Especially with its realistic game environment. It's lack of mech's to pilot (only 4 and i have 496 medals) is a serios downside. But the weapons amd equipment partly make up for it's mech lack. The ability to look and observe your enemy in the weapons system option is cool but you kind of wish you could pilot everything. Even tanks, helicopters, and that one jet fighter. Overall the gameplay is one of the most realistic in mech games. But I still wish i could pilot the Brutal crab>sob!"
4,Better than you'd think!,"A sequel to the 2 Saturn games(the second was not released in the US), Gungriffon is now here in the states , courtesy of Working Designs. Most people will compare Gungriffon to Armored Core 2...while they are both ""Mech"" type games, the Armored Core series has always been more ""sim"" like than Gungriffon(which has always been more arcade like)...so of course, Armored Core has more parts to customize, etc. While it is the general belief that Armored Core is better than Gungriffon, I'd say that they are on equal ground. Gungriffon Blaze has a lot going for it. Graphics are good for a 1st gen game, and as usual, Game Arts gameplay is excellent. The sound is excellent, and Working Designs made a good choice in bringing over this title. A solid game, but if you want customization, than you'd be better off with Armored Core. If you like more fast action paced gameplay, than here you go. Mech fans will get both."
1,Not so good.,The graphics are pretty good. The controls are o.k. However -The mission objectives are unclear. The mech customization is limited. The missions become difficult quickly. The background dialog is annoying. Weapon and special equipment specs are not spelled out. I quit playing after the fourth mission and I don't think I will ever pick it up again.
2,Not good,"I'm glad I rented this game first, it really stinks and the graphics are not that good,for a playstation2, that is. This game is pretty borring too. All I have to say is, rent it first."
2,surprising....a waist of money,"Im giving this game 2 stars and thats just because im really nice. First of all this game is horrible. You have no raidar so you cant see your enemy, the graphics are terrible, your guns suck and last of not least i would of had more fun spending my ... dollars on bubble gum then buying this game. I could go on but i wish to stop just to be nice to the people who made this game."
2,very bad and im not kidding,"i gave this game 2 stars and thats just because im a nice guy. the game play is horrible, you have no radar only for a light that goes off when you get close to a bad guy, the graphics are more suitable for a nintendo 64 game, and last but not least i would of had more fun buying bubble gum for ... dollars then this game."
1,A Diamond better off kept hidden...,"This is one diamond that should stay hidden... Sappy elevator music, can you say B-O-R-I-N-G!!! Yawn..."
3,Realistic portrait of classroom dynamics,"Every classroom has to have a class clown, and in Miss Mackle's second grade class, Horrible Harry takes the honor. His vivid imagination generally amuses the class and teacher, but his latest stunt, involving purple people that only he can see, has raised the ire of Mary, one of his classmates.Kline, a teacher, has painted a realistic portrait of classroom dynamics. You can tell her characters are drawn from real life, even if her scenarios seem a bit unreal and sketchy. The conclusion is a bit hasty, and we never find out whether the purple people are real, or why Mary is behaving like such a pill. But the humor is gentle, the drawings illuminating and kids should enjoy the easy read."
4,Excellent book for young readers,The creative illustrations capture the emotions and activities as if the reader were part of the story. This book is very well designed with an equal combination of text and artwork. The carefully chosen words create a stream of energetic curiousity.
4,Fun Movie for the Whole Family,"I brought this movie home for my nine year old son to watch and ended up watching it with him. The acting and story line is good, and expect for a few bad special effects at the end (the flying carpet scenes are a little rough) it was a really good movie. (It helps that the princess in the movie is easy on the eyes..). A good rental choice. Four Stars."
5,DVD,My son loves these type of movies. They have action along with being funny just enough to keep your interest. The DVD was just as it was said to be from the company.
2,enjoyably stupid,"little kids might enjoy it. Apparently Aladdin's wife, daughter and his evil brother Luxor very British. and the gene was a [...] hipster. In 8the century arabia they knew how to read English world 'Pizza deivery' and knew what Pizza was.This is hilariously stupid"
1,Don't waste your money,"This was horrible. We were a captive audience at someone else's house and it wasn't fun, it wasn't original, it was just painful."
1,as enjoyable as a toothache,"This sequel to the disney movie ""Kid in King Arthur's Castle"" is as pointless a sequel as Son of the mask. This is really a disney ripoff. The lamp looks the same as Disney's aladdin. The part that gets me confused. If the lamp vanished like 80,000 years ago. How would it end up in a pizza place. Don't waste your money on this stupid movie."
4,A smaller version of the Liturgy of the Hours,"This is a great book to help improve and deepen one's prayer life. However, if one is unfamiliar with the Liturgy of the Hours, there is little instructional material here to help get started."
2,Annoying typography,"My 2 star rating is based entirely on the typography used for the book. As you can see in the sample pages, a font was chosen which is sort of vertically stretched and horizontally smooshed. I find it rather uncomfortable to read. Your opinion may vary, but it makes me want to avoid spending much time reading the text.What I have read, though, looks useful."
1,Not worth the time!,"This book is rather brief. This book is like a brief assortment of topics.It didn't help me much. For time management (which possibly is the greatest skill that any student must master), the authors just mention very briefly."
5,"Good flash, great bounce","I purchased this because I hate shadow buddies and the harsh flash light. This flash gives a soft lighting, is lightweight, and easy to use."
4,Good buy,"Great little flash unit for Digital SLRs that are compatible. Unit is small and lightweight and low profile on the camera allowing for better maneuverability. Has a boune function as well which is great, best for horizontal shots rather than vertical shots because it does not swivel. Uses 2 AA batteries. Would recommend as a value purchase over the SB-900 which has more bells and whistles, but is 5x the cost."
3,Small flash packs a punch,"This very small flash does a decent job. I use an SB900 as a rule, but when you are in tight quarters or just need a little fill flash...this flash does a pretty good job. It will even rotate up so you can bounce light off ceiling. Not bad for the price. Also good for a novice shooter."
4,Great synching with a Nikon D-40,This little flash does a great job with even exposures for a Nikon D-40. Aiming the light up and bouncing it off even 17 foot ceilings will allow for nice soft lighting.
1,Different than advertised,The picture in the description shows a low profile oval light. The light is quite tall and does not pivot like the description says & does not work on ETTL cameras as described
5,Works well,"I've had mine for a week and I am pleased with the purchase. It seems to work very well. The main advantages are its small size, it doesn't drain the camera batteries, and it can be bounced vertically which reduces the harshness of the flash in some situations.It seems to recycle even faster than advertised with NiMh batteries.Metering w. my recently purchased D80 is always perfect."
5,Just what it looks like.,"This is Nikon's baby flash. It doesn't have all the bells and whistles of the larger, heavier, more sophisticated (and much more expensive) SB-600 or SB-800 flashes.What it does have is:It's small and light and low profile (you won't be as paranoid about busting it off like the big ones that stick way up in the air) so you'll be more likely to just leave it on the camera all the time instead of having to dig it out of the bag whenever you want to use it. It only takes 2 AA batteries so it's a lot lighter than the bigger units which take 4. It's very easy to install and use.I originally bought it for my D-50 and it worked fine on that and now on the new D-80 that I upgraded to. It also works on my little Nikon Coolpix P5000 which is really handy when I don't want to lug all the heavy iron.Oh yeah...the pics are a lot better than when using the built-in flash too. And you are less likely to get shadows when using a big lens hood."
5,Took several hundred pictures in two weeks with the SB-400.,"I visited Africa and got shots that others, with more expensive cameras, didn't get. Why? Because I had the compact SB-400 Speedlight to use with my Nikon D-40; and others didn't want to be bothered with carrying their big flash units. I took some great pictures of Leopards and Cheetahs in low light. If I need flash, I hardly ever use my built-in flash. It's so easy to just clamp on the SB-400. Often, I would just leave the flash on the camera, it takes up so little space. So....I really recommend the SB-400 Speedlight. I just keep it in a small nook in my camera bag; and I can get 60ft.+ coverage. Oh, be sure to angle the flash up for portraits. It gives you wonderful flesh tones."
4,"Nice add-on for my Nikon D7000, but......","Nice add-on for my Nikon D7000, but limited to small areas that need extra flash. For large areas and distance you need to go bigger."
4,"Like the big ones, in small package","only bad thing i found in this product is the automated iso mode, it cranks up to Iso1600 works with the camera exposure so you bounce flash and it cranks ISO, should be always at iso 100 and when bounced it should flash a powerfull light not cranck the iso to reach for a good light condition"
4,Super easy to use...,"I love the compact design and that ease of use of the flash. I like the fact that it uses batteries. I like how you can bounce the flash in such a small flash. Pretty great flash for the price. Some things I don't like though is there are only 3 angles to bounce the flash. wish it had more. also don't expect it to do a great job in really large rooms with high ceilings (i.e.: church, anywhere above a 15 ft ceiling pretty much). But for the price you can't beat it."
5,Great speedlight,Very compact and portable speedlight. I definite improvement over the in camera flash. Probably one of the best investments for improving the look of your indoor pictures.
4,Good Flash,This is the first external flash that I have purchased. I am very happy with my purchase. I think I may eventually purchase a larger one but for everyday use it is great!
5,Changed the way I shoot,"Being fairly new to the DSLR world, I'm constantly learning how to get the best out of my D50. This flash has been the most important piece to the puzzle to get the results I want. I was very frustrated when I always got the washed out look when shooting indoor photos of my newborn son. Once I learned about flash bounce and purchased the SB-4oo, I really started to get the results I was looking for. The skin tones are much more natural and it really illuminates the background and provides great fill light. Excellent purchase, a must if shooting indoor shots."
5,Nikon's Little Jewel - SB400,"Just recently acquired a used but in great shape Nikon Coolpix P5100 point and shoot. I mated the camera to my SB400 which has transformed the coolpix into a rather impressive dslr competitor. Sb400 can really get the job done while keeping portablity and convience in the fore-front. Best of all, it seems to be a perfect, well balance, match for the camera. Sure to please the pickiest photographer. Best use is for casual and family pictures. For more demanding photographic capture consider Nikon's excellent line of DSLR cameras.Pro:1. highly portable2. very easy and convient3. good scene illumination4. fast recycle times5. good battery life (2500 mAH, Ni-H)Cons:1. limited bounce functions2. no auto focus illumination3. only ttl and manual mode4. no ""slave"" function"
4,Great product for the price.,"Being an amateur photographer, I didn't need anything extravagant in terms of lighting. The built in flash just did not give me the control I wanted for lighting shots, and I needed to be able to bounce light as desired. This is a great way to give yourself some control over on camera lighting and not break the bank doing it. I am sure pros would want something more powerful, but for hobbyists this is great. Works as advertised, and I have not had any issues in terms of usability or reliability."
5,Perfect for the Nikon P7000,"I bought this speedlight before purchasing the Nikon P7000 because I knew I wanted a Nikon with a hot shoe.I went on a trip to California last year, and I forgot my point and shoot. I love my D90, but attaching my rather bulky SB-600 adds so much weight to the already hefty D90. Attaching this speedlight helped reduce the bulk when I was doing some sightseeing. This speedlight, however, is perfect for the P7000 (or P7100). It doesn't tip over the camera when you attach it (unlike attaching an SB-600 or bigger), and it gives you that soft light that you want because you can angle the flash up to 90 degrees. If you have a P7000 or P7100, this will help you with your indoor photography."
4,A good step up.,"I own a Nikon D5100Nikon D5100 16.2MP CMOS Digital SLR Camera with 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 AF-S DX VR Nikkor Zoom Lens. The on board flash was actually not bad. however it's very limited and can be very harsh. This little unit helped a lot with that by being able to tilt the flash head to bounce the light. It also extends the light to make it somewhat useful in macro shots as it gets past the problem of lens shadow. I'm sure it would not compare well with a pro model with all it's settings, but for the amateur, even a serious one. this would be great. Light weight,easy to use, small in size (no trouble finding a spot for it in my camera case), comes with it's own soft case. Great price.Nikon SB-400 AF Speedlight Flash for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras"
3,Not what the Doctor ordered...,"I saw all the reviews before I purchased the the flash and was soooooooo excited to finally get it, but after that very disappointed. The flash is not strong enough, and it's no stronger than the built-in flash on my Nikon D40. I was trying to capture the spontaneity of my niece Sweet 16 birthday party I was VERY disappointed with the pictures that I took with the flash. When I removed the external flash, then used the built in flash I have beautiful memorable pictures..."
3,Weak and takes forever to charge.,"I wasn't expecting much and that's what I got. After a half-dozen shots it starts taking several minutes to recharge and shots are missed. It's really only suited for fill, and the built-in can perform that role. I think I will return it, bite the bullet, and buy an SB-600."
3,Too dark,Just processed my images from the first use of this flash on my D300S. Oddly enough all the images came out too dark. I had to enhance every one with Aperture. Did not get any red-eye with this flash and it is compact and has no settings. Like the ease of use. Amateur photographer.
5,Great size.,I bought this for my Nikon D80 and it goes along really nice. Not as big as the bulky SB-600 or 800. Its a great carry around flash for leisure shooting. If your wrking a wedding or something I would go for the upper models but if your just starting out and dont need the big guns then this is for you.
2,Disappointed,This SB-400 AF Flash did not work for me as expected. I notice that there is a split second delay in the picture being clicked and the flash going off; hence the pictures are dark frequently. Some pictures come out ok. I am disappointed with this purchase and do not think that the money spent was worth it.
1,Poor Nikon Quality,"I bought this flash to go along with my D40x. After struggling with poor quality photos, I took the D40 back to the shop where I bought it from, and they agreed that the camera needed servicing. So out the camera body went to Nikon for a few weeks. Nikon agreed the camera was defective, repaired it, and it came back working normally. The flash then worked fine for 3 months, but it too has stopped working. Now I have to go through the hassle of shipping my flash off to Nikon for repairs again. My camera is used primarily for taking family and baby photos, and I handle the camera very gently. I am very, very disappointed in Nikon quality. Either I am particularly unlucky, or Nikon makes cheap junk nowadays."
4,Compact and cost effective choice for a basic flash unit. I take it everywhere that my Nikon D7000 goes. Basic up-down swivel.,I get an amazing number of cycles on a set of batteries. This is great value for a quality flash unit.
2,Handy to have,It leaves a shadow and bright hot spot light. I need a larger flash with indirect flash to avoid hot spot.
2,I need help!,"I just purchased this product & I've noticed that its hard to get on my camera body & when I did get it on & turned it on, it came on but wouldn't flash! I'm wondering if its compatible with my Nikon D5000???? Hope that someone can help me!"
4,"Works well, but battery life a bit short","I first should say I own a Nikon D50 with an SB-600 flash. The SB-600 is a bit large and unwieldy, so I was happy to hear about the SB-400. I was heading out on a trip to Europe, so I bought one figuring its small size would work better in a crowded tourist environment than the rather bulky SB-600.The SB-400 worked well, but recycle time was a problem. Within half a dozen shots, I started to experience 10-second recycle time. I could work around that, but I don't like to. I switched back to the SB-600 and had no further problems.The SB-400 has two batteries, while the SB-600 has four. I'd guess that's the reason."
5,Perfect for my needs,"I was looking for a smaller flash unit to go with my wife's camera. The SB-400 fits the bill, and it works seamlessly with her D3000. She only needs to slide it on the hot shoe, and turn it on - all the other controls are managed in the camera. A very powerful unit for its small size, and perfect for our needs."
2,not very bright,I have a Nikon 5100. I was hoping this flash can help indoor photography. But it is almost as bright as my camera flash. not very satisfied.
2,A good flash while it lasted,"My SB-400 died after less than 500 shots. Unfortunately, this was long after the warranty was up. It's completely gone--no sounds, no lights.It was an excellent flash. The biggest downside was that it could only bounce the flash off of ceilings in landscape shots. Put your camera vertical, and you can only bounce off of side walls. It doesn't swivel.Unfortunately while looking for a replacement today, I've found that the SB-400 is out of stock at large retailers, and only available at about 50% more than what I got it for in 2008 (and close to what the SB-600 used to go for)."
4,Nice little flash,Nikon SB-400 AF Speedlight for Nikon Digital SLR CamerasI bought this flash for my Nikon D-80 SLR and I a very happy with it. I don't need to break out my large flash for every occasion.
5,Hot Shoe Flash for Nikon D40,"Have not used it to a great amount yet but what I have done has shown a great addition to the cameras function. A larger unit may be better for a pro but for an amateur this unit is handy, compact, and much easier to use"
2,SB-400 Loved It While It Lasted,"I loved this flash while it lasted! I shoot a D90 indoors a few times a year for parties and such and my pictures looked much better when bouncing this flash. After using it maybe 10-15 times, it up and died, so I sent it in to Nikon for repair (I was just out of warranty). I got the repair estimate back today and my jaw dropped. Total cost was $103!!!! Seeing how I could (but won't) buy a brand new one for $17 more, I was in total shock and called up customer service. They didn't care and a supervisor declined my request to speak with them.A+ product when it works.F- for product support and customer service.I won't buy another one."
3,Not as good as the SB-600,"I got this to go with my Nikon D40. It is an improvement from the built-in flash for sure, but not as good and versatile as theNikon SB-600 Speedlight Flash for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras. I ended up returning this one and buying the SB-600 instead.Pros for the SB-400 are size and price - best for portability. It is definitely an improvement over the built-in flash for light quality and ceiling bounce.Biggest weakness is that I can't use it for portrait photography bouncing off the ceiling. Please see review ofStroboframe Press-T Flash Rotating Bracketfor details."
5,Great piece of equipment!,"I bought this flash about a year ago & it works beautifully. Will provide lots of light for great pictures, I use it w/a Nikon D40x. Made a great flash for night time pictures in Paris in the last year - and I angered quite a few people trying to get candid shots on the Paris Metro! I recommend this flash highly to anyone who's serious about photography."
5,excellent entry level flash,"The Nikon SB-400 is a very good unit. I have taken some excellent pictures with the bounce feature.It is simple to use,but puts a lot of light out for a small unit,I am happy with mine."
5,Very versatile flash unit for cheap!,"Bought this unit after reading up on [...] just how well it worked for such a little investment. I use it all the time to angle upward and use ""bounce flash"" on my Nikon D40. Makes for much better light for indoor than a direct flash. Generally, I angle it up one notch for shooting across the room (12-15 feet) or all the way up for a fairly close-range shot. For those that don't understand the concept, bounce flash basically uses the ceiling as a giant reflector and diffuser for a more natural look. For $120, you wouldn't believe the difference in your photos.I've also toyed around with using my hand as a reflector, and even an inflated white grocery bag as a diffuser/reflector with some interesting results. It also works great on outdoor shots for a fill flash, so no more shadowed faces on bright sunny days."
4,Great flash and compact size,"I bought this flash for my Nikon D40x...it's a great little flash with a nice swivel feature for ""bounce"" flash options. I've gotten some great pics using this indoors andd outdoors. In addition, it's compact size and low profile help keep the D40x in perfect balance. Highly recommended!"
5,I have a Nikon SB-900 and SB-400,The SB-400 with a Gary Fong diffuser paints light in a precise manner that is just as good (just less power) as the SB-900 with it's built-in whitecard but much more compact and much less weight as well. I save the SB-900 for weddings and large events and the rest of the time the SB-400 is always on my camera. Travels well in a coat pocket. It's simply a must have.This lens is very very easy on lithium batteries and recharges very quickly.Perhaps the best selling feature is how well the SB-400 works in concert with Nikon cameras. It takes your mind off correct exposures so you can concentrate on photography and not the equiptment. 3rd party flashes can't hold a candle to Nikon flashes.
3,Can Do Without It,Bought it so I'd be able to get better lighting when taking pictures. Doesn't seem to make that much difference. Straight on or bounce flash no different. Product is very delicate. Broke the battery door within the first year and had to pay to ship/fix.
5,Nikon,"Purchased for my son for Christmas, this was a product that he had requested and is very happy with it."
4,Flash,I dont think it is much stronger than the original flash on my camera but I am sure it helps. I still have some low light problems. It makes it easier to do rapid shots though.
4,Exactly what I need and as I expected.,"work properly, perfect fit to the camera and easy to carry. Arrived before predicted and in perfect conditions. Great value acquisition."
4,Great flash in a small package,"I am relatively new to the digital world, have converted from film cameras two years ago. My big problem was with the built in flash on my digital Nikon. While good for most applications, definitely not sufficient for portraits, weddings or any other application where control of the light is an issue. This flash has a great range and because it has a bounce feature makes it ideal for many situations where diffusion, or red eye, or reduction of shadows is needed. It also is economical to operate and a set of batteries lasts a good long time."
5,Simple,This beauty is incredibly easy to USO. Snap it on and shoot. Perfect exposure every time. Fits in a pocket when unneeded .
5,Great Album,This album has a nice variety of selections. I particularly like the solos by Buddy. He plays the smoothest trombone you will ever hear.
3,OK but keep shopping,Not an easy read. I just could not get into this book. Read the sample pages to see if this is the style of writing you enjoy before you buy it.
5,New century's new genius,His way of interpreting the pieces is perfect. I had a chance to listen to him in Aspendos (Ancient theater). That was great. He is also a good composer. I strongly suggest you to listen this CD. It gives you a clue of Fazil Say's creativity.
1,VERY VERY BAD BAD BAD BAD! ! WORST BOOK EVER!,this is the worst SVH book i have ever read in my life
5,only way to go,"These flash cards are the best way to drill the info into your brain. And the older versions still work too. Keep them around for any and all exams, essay, quizzes."
5,A huge help,Myself and a lot of my classmates used these for our final exam and I have to tell you that they were a HUGE help. Notes and books are great too but myself and a few of my classmates used this as one of our primary ways of preparing the last few days before exams. I highly recommend.
2,Not a good example of his work. Disappointing.,"The mention of a man who gets a thrill out of abusing a woman sexually and then killing her has no place in a Fabio novel. I know that he has coauthors but the woman who coauthored this novel must not be in sync with the Fab. Romance Fabio, Romance!!!! No abuse of women in your books even if the abuse does not involve the main characters:-"
1,just plain bad,"I can't believe it's not butter? I can't believe this guy is a writer! The characters don't make any sense, they are all two dimentional, predictable, and have no motivation beyond their own carnal desire. Real people are not like this, and yes, I know, it's fiction...but as Mark Twain once said, ""fiction has to make sense"". Nothing about this book did."
1,I can't belive he's a writer...,"This book was a joke... Fabio should just stick to his... ""I can't believe it's not butter"" commercials... I would give this book a half a star if possible. I would also give a longer review if I didn't find this book to be a utter waste of my time and money!"
1,take away his word processer,"the French have a word for books like this...""Le Pew!"" This guy is supposed to be romantic? and he treats his women as two dimentional characters who can be beaten and killed? Please, give a contract to some starving author who can write a novel. This is why I stick to reading the classics."
3,durability limited by gel padding,"I've used this pack about 40 times per year for four years, and have really liked it. It's a comfortable simple pack, without the unnecessary special-purpose features you find on most packs. The nylon ""Airlift"" straps have an internal layer of red ""gelastic gellycomb"", which makes for comfortable padding. There's a small plastic window on the strap that lets you view this layer.After about two years, I noticed that the gellycomb was starting to melt. It was morphing from a criss-cross pattern to a blob, but this didn't affect the pack functionally. Now, however, the sections of the straps that rest on the shoulders are becoming covered with a red sticky substance as the gellycomb slowly melts and oozes out through the cloth. The pack has become unusable, even though the rest of it is in excellent condition.If JanSport produced this pack with a better strap, I'd rate it 5 stars; but the sticky oozing strap limits its durability."
3,works alright,"I had heard a LOT of talk about this deodorant. Turns out it really was all talk. it's 25% ALUMINUM so when you apply it you literally begin to start to smell like -metal-. that seeps into your skin and can cause all sorts of reactions. This deodorant worked great the FIRST TIME I used it. however, every subsequent time AFTER is just didn't cut it. I'm back to square one."
5,A book that helped change history,This report by Elie Weisel on the Jews of Silence helped increase greatly Western interest in the Russian Jewish community. It helped rally the Jewish world in support of the emigration movement. And eventually it helped in the liberation of the Soviet Jews from their prison. Over one million were to come to Israel in the decades ahead.It is rare that a book has so much influence. A courageous witness like Elie Weisel deserves great credit for this historical ' miracle'.
2,They went too far.,"While Jonathon pryce did an amazing job with Fagen, I was not impressed with the production as a whole. I do not like the added songs. The songs were the cheesy stereotypical songs that I think people hate about musicals. Also, I think the horribly graphic murder of Nancy was completely inappropriate. It was so horrific! Some of the best things about theatre is the emotions and actions they ""imply"" it doesn't have to be in your face to have an impact.For me the best will always be the Original Broadway cast from 1963. (although you have to love the film version with Ron Moody, carol Reed and Jack Wild)"
2,Disappointing,"Just not as good as the original movie soundtrack. I had high hopes, based on other reviews here, but it didn't have the same magic and over-the-top quality to the production numbers."
2,Sally Dexter Is Awful!,"This recording of Oliver is okay! It is nothing in comparison to the original Broadway Recording. Although the orchestrations are better, the singers in the original cast are much better. Jonathan Pryce is good. His singing voice sounds very different from when he speaks, although I'm sure his stage presence made up for his minor flaws (but that doesn't make a good CD.)The Oliver has a beautiful voice but maybe a little to pretty. He sounds much older than the character is intended to be. But he does have a good voice. What really turned me off from this CD was the Sally Dexter. She is the worst Nancy I have ever heard. She puts no feeling into the music and her rendition of ""As Long As He Needs Me"" needs a lot of work. Her voice is nice but not incredible. Nancy is probably one of the greatest roles in Broadway history and she brings down the whole production. If you want to hear a good Nancy listen to Georgia Brown!"
2,Overblown Revival,"I too looked forward to this recording. Oliver was one of my favorite shows from the 1960s. This recording lacks all of the charm of the original recording (Broadway cast.) Songs go on forever, orchestrations and choral arrangements are overblown and go over the same territory tediously. Stick to the original Broadway or London cast recordings - you'll hear the show as it was originally intended. Short, to the point and quite poignant. And besides, no one can come close the Georgia Brown!"
3,"Oliver, More Please!","If you love the Musical, you will love this CD! I keep a copy of this in my travel cd case because it is lively and fun on the road! Great versions of the songs!"
1,Oliver,not original oliver not what I would have bought in store or if I had heard it before purchase thx
2,What can I say?,"""Becket"" does rise an interesting question about honor, but I didn't enjoy it too much. It was interesting though, how Thomas's instincts, beliefs and morals change when he is appointed archbishop. I don't think there is any possible way that he can change so drastically overnight. Sure, he could have become a religious man, but his WHOLE life changed so quickly. Who knows?"
2,I wouldn't read it again,"There was something about this book that I just didn't like. Even though its a true story, it seemed a little exaggerated, especially in regard to the king."
4,Not too bad,"There were a few passages that were very hard to read as the writing was so very bad. But I stuck with it. The main reason why it got this rating from me, was I really liked the plot, and I liked the way the characters developed. I like that background that the story is set in. Although, I have read only the first four books, I liked this one the best."
3,Nomads of Gor,"Before Twilight, before 50 Shades, there was Gor. These books have been around a long time. They are some of the earliest ""Mommy Porn"". Back when I was a much younger me, I read most of the Gor books. This one was one of my favorites. Besides being sexy (they are all sexy), this one was also very funny. Most people will agree that sex is psychological. You won't find the graphic details in these books, but as far as I am concerned ""Hot"" is a frame of mind, and this book is ""HOT""! I hope you enjoy it as much as I did. Please note: I would have given this 4 stars, but the writer is a bit long winded in places. A few skipped pages may be required."
2,disgusting ideology,"disgusting ideology, such as claiming true love between woman and man could only be found if the woman is a true slave to the man, under fear of the whip. Women are abducted, forced into slavery, and risk their lives if they try fleeing. They are slept in chains and kept in very harsh conditions."
5,A true Sci-Fi fan's treasure!,"Definately the best of all the John Norman books. The characters leap from the pages into your heart and the heroes tear cheers from your lips! Without doubt, the best book I have ever read."
3,an up and coming singer,a very good begining for a neo-soul singer. he should get better with age. his next one should be a hit.
3,Wouldn't it be great if it was like this all the time?,"This album features other people singing the songs of Van Morrison, and is co-produced by Van himself. Most of the performance are good, particularly the ones by Sinead O'Connor, Cassandra Wilson and Elvis Costello. The weakest track is probably the baffling spoken word version of ""Coney Island"" by actor Liam Neeson. Van's daughter Shana is featured here in a duet with Brian Kennedy, and it turns out that she has a beautiful voice. Fans of ""The Man"" who want to hear other artists performing his songs will probably find this CD interesting."
4,Vintage Williams,"Tennessee Williams is, of course, one of the country's master dramatists. So much emphasis is placed on his plays, however, that it is easy to forget that Williams--poet, novelist, essayist--was a true man of letters. While it lacks the intensity of ""Streetcar"" or the heartbreaking tenderness of ""The Glass Menagerie,"" ""The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone"" is vintage Williams just the same. Williams once said that he was interested in characters who ""were frightened of life. . .who were desperate to reach out to another person."" Karen Stone, a lonely, fragile woman who is desperate to ""stop the drift"" following the death of her husband and her own fading youth and beauty, is such a character. It will never be considered one of his masterpieces, but it will touch your heart in a way that only Williams can."
5,I liked it just fine,It was just what I expected. I liked it just fine. I don't know what more you want me to say.
3,Adapter,I ordered it but it was the wrong one for what I needed it for. I am sure that it is a good product.
2,Does not work,"I had planned to use this item so I could listen to music on my phone. There is a lot of crackle if you move the jack whatsoever. Also, when the headphones are plugged all the way into the device sound only comes out of one side of the headphones. If you pull the headphone jack partially out of the adapter and hold it there, you get sound from both left and right headphones. Completely unsatisfactory. I will be purchasing something else. The good thing is that this item is so cheap that I'm not out very much money."
4,good almost great,i purchased three and one had a bit of a short in it but overall the product is much better than one that i used before.
1,Deceptive sale,It is not producing stereo sound with my cellphone ( MOTOROLA W755).Bad product description. also I ordered black and received white.Seller does not facilitate return. you have to pay the shipping cost both ways.
2,Doesnt work W/Xbox Controller,"I purchased this item to use with my Xbox controller. Rather than purchase a whole new microphone, I figured I could grab this and just use my mic from my PC. Unfortunately, it does not work. The fit into the controller is very loose, but I've tried wiggling it around while talking and I still get nothing, so I don't believe that is the issue.On the screen it shows the microphone as repeatedly being connected and disconnected, and at times, outputting audio (though my friends tell me it's nothing but static when it does decide to output sound). Overall, I only spent $1.35, so it's not like it was a ton of money wasted. That said, it is annoying that it didn't work as I now need to either purchase a different dongle or an actual mic made for the Xbox."
2,get what you pay for!,"Firstly, the item I received is not what is pictured: there is no wire, just a straight plug. Second, it worked well the first time I used it to listen to music from my phone through my auxiliary output in my car, but it now only plays out of the left speaker. I tested it with a couple pairs of headphones and it's the same story. It makes an annoying clicking sound when moved around in the jack.At $1.20, I didn't need nor was I expecting anything fancy... just for it to work!"
2,Cheap adaptor...,"But you get what you pay for. I'm sure for just a regular audio setup, this plug style adaptor would be ideal. As it stands I feel ever so slightly misled by the product photos. I was really looking forward to a cord style adaptor but instead received the straight plug in type that does not fit flush with my phone.It works, but only mono sound. There is a stationary ""sweet spot"" that I can find to get the stereo sound to work...But to much hassle. All in all I'm just going to go back to the two cell setup I had previously until I find a better cable in store."
2,Warning : picture may not match actual product,"I ordered this item because the picture showed a 90-degree male plug (a plug with an L-bend). However, what I received was a male plug with a straight plug instead. When I contacted the company they apologized for the using an outdated photo (that was the middle of September 2010) but they said that the written description of the product never actually mentioned any 90-degree bend... They offered me the option of returning it but frankly the return shipping cost would have been at least a third or a half of the product cost which just didn't make it worth my time to do. Maybe I'll find a use for it somewhere.I just wish they'd update their photo appropriately."
2,It was cheap but..,"When I use it as a cell phone adapter, I have to pull it out and wiggle it a little bit to get the headphones to work. It also cuts out or falls out on a regular basis. I have to hold my phone still to keep it working."
1,Crappy Mono,"I bought this to use as an adapter in my car. It plays only poor quality mono, not stereo as the product description states. I'm getting a refund."
1,If you have LG Lotus do not order from SF Planet,I ordered this from SF Planet twice both times it was defective on an LG Lotus Phone. SF Planet does have good service but the product will not work with an LG Lotus.
3,Not as displayed,"Picture shows the 2.5 plug as being angled. This was why I bought it, to use in a case. It works good, but does not fit the need I bought it for, because it is not as dipicted in the picture."
3,be warned,"it does what it was made to do, but not what i wanted it to. i wanted to plug my favorite 3.5mm headphones into it and use them to listen to music on my phone. it works like it should, but it, like all adapters, only plays music through the right headphone... if your planning on using it for a phone you need to buy headphones with a 2.5mm plug directly on it for both ears to work."
3,Just passable,"- Needs adjustment when actual headphones are placed within.-When used in a car, for conversion from a tape to your phone, only half the sound works in the vehicle.-Cannot place headphones all the way inside the port; awkward halfway point for both sides of sound to work.Alters phone settings when left plugged in; a hassle. For those who expect something real good, its more like 2-stars."
3,wrong adapter but good service,Headphone jack did not work on the BB 8830 even though it said it was universal. Bought another one from Best Buy that did work. The plugs look exactly the same but tolerances must be different. They refunded my money without even asking so overall I am satisfied.
3,Not for LG enV,"This is a perfectly fine product, but I should have bought the adapter with three little black bands instead of two. The three-banded adapter is the one that works with my LG enV."
1,crappy shipping and i got the wrong cable,"ordered a 2.5 to 3.5, instead got a 3.5 yo s 2.5 and it took way too long considering the size and weight."
1,Not a standard device.,"This is not a standard product.The 1.5 mm slot did not work as an interface for my 1.5mm Samsung headset. The 2.5 mm did not work for my laptop, so this product is either incorrectly designed or I got a bad deal.Stay away from this interface. Buy a proper 2.5mm headset instead."
1,dissapointed,This item works but only in one ear. I plugged in two working headphones but could only hear out of one ear. It is useless to me now.
5,3.5mm to 2.5 adapter,I use the adapter every day to connect my E71X Nokia Cell phone to my earphones or powered audio amplifier. It works great! It eliminates the phone speakers sound distortion. For $1.98 shipping cost it's a real bargain.
1,Junk,This adapter is not worth 1 cent. It only provides a crackly fuzzy sound through one side of my headphones. If you wiggle it around it eventually will work for a second. It reminds me of 10 year old headphones that are ready for the trash. Don't waste your money. They are a good price but a bad bargain.
4,Adapter,Item arrived on time and packaged well. It is what it is and does the job. Would buy again if needed and would recommend.
2,very cheap,the cord is very flimsy and small. it seems like it could break very easy. the picture makes the cord look thicker than it is.
1,Wrong Item,They sent the wrong thing. The ends were reversed it was very inexpenive so did not bother sending it back.I put in another order thru amazon and got the right thing.
1,What the heck?,"I got this product and it was a 3.5 male to a 2.5 female, avoid this product unless you need what I just listed."
2,Mono Only,This item didn't work in STEREO with my cell phone or other electronic devices. It might work with other devices than the one's I own?
2,"Not sure if this works, it did not work on my cell phone.","Not sure if this worked, it did not work on my cell phone. That is why i bought the device. I have a feeling the problem was my cell phone. Who knows. Price was cheap to find out. So I'm not too upset. Found out a jupiter jack solved my issue of using my cell phone as an mp3 player in my car."
1,I should have read the description more closely; it clearly says headphone not headset,"I don't know it this thing works or not, so I can't honestly give it a review. I would suggest to anyone that they read the description more carefully than I did.I bought a wired headset; this thing was included in the ""frequently bought together"" thingy on the page. The price was right; I figured, ""why not"".Why a headphone adaptor was included on a headset page is beyond me; I assumed when you buy a headset, a headset adaptor would be included not a headphone adaptor.Next time, I'll read the descriptions more carefully, so the reasonable price could be considered a cheap education :-). (I couldn't mail it back for a refund for what it cost me)."
3,Good product compare to price,"It is good product for the price. I am getting static noise in certain position, after twisting the product with 3.5 headphone it works."
3,Wanted to use it for regular headphones - nope.,"Part arrived promptly, but it would not work as I had hoped. Nothing wrong with it - but don't buy if unless you use a 3 section plug."
1,"Not worth the price, and definitely not worth the shipping","Almost useless since there was a short. The wire needs to be laid in the right position so that both channels work and there is no static. Forget about using it on your person, e.g. in your pocket while walking. I would say order several at this price, but shipping for Amazon Affiliates is per-item and could get expensive.I have a few different types of these connectors - one at work, one at my mom's house, one in the car. They all work flawlessly, so the problem is not in my phone.Spend the extra money and get a name-brand adapter."
4,Not For Palm Centro,"I learned the hard way, palm centro requires a convertor with 4 lines on the jack and this one only has 2. The Centro will act up if you buy this particular convertor"
1,doesn't work properly,"This product does not work. Well let me restate that; if you do not touch your cell phone after you plug this in it may work for you. Any slight movement to the jack will prevent this adapter from working. I can't say I'm all that upset with this product b/c it cost me less than $5.00. However, after purchasing this adapter jack and discovering it does not work I went to radio shack and bought an $11.00 adapter and it seems to work perfectly. If you're trying to turn your cell phone into an MP3 player this is not the product for you. Spend a little bit more money and get something that works."
1,Don't have it to review it.,"Have not received the product.Therefore,I can not review it.the previous item was received,I need this to work with it and see the function."
3,Its a crapshoot...,"Some people complain that they got a 3-contact adapter, thats what i wanted. Ive bought 2 of these and they are the 4-contact ones that are pictured. Seller must have poor quality control at the warehouse because there are pictures of 2 different items. If you're looking for an adapter its a toss up wether you'll get the one you need. Unfortunately i lost the toss, but for a dollar i'll gamble again."
5,Very handy,"My android is a bit unusual in that it has a 2.5 mm jack. It came with special ear buds that had a 2.5 mm jack, but I really don't like using ear buds unless it's just too inconvenient to use headphones. So rather than having to spend a bunch of money on special headphones with a tiny jack, I was very relieved to find that this product exists. Thanks to this little converter jack I can use my good ol' big headphones with my android. And I think probably the best thing about it is that these things are so cheap that it's not a big deal when I loose them hahah."
3,"Seller sent another one for free, new one also has the same problem.","I received a new one for free as the previous one has a problem (Did not returned). But the new one also has the same issue, only one ear works, the other ear is not working. When I adjust the socket to somewhere in the middle (not plugging/inserting completely) I get some disturbance but both the headphones (both ears) are working in that scenario. But it is not possible to use them holding it in that position. I tried using this for Panasonic KX-TG6533B DECT 6.0 Cordless phone, with my Apple headphones."
2,dud?,I plugged this in and I only hear in one ear. When I wiggle it I can almost hear in the other ear but just for a sec. I don't know if it's the phone or the connecter. It sounds like crap though. At least I only wasted a buck-twenty. I ordered some headphones with a 2.5 jack so we will soon see if it was the connecter or not. Good luck with yours!
2,Not thrilled with this,"the price was great but the quality is not there. If I push my headphone connector all the way in, I only hear music out of one channel. I have to pull the connector half way out to hear both channels. a pain in the butt but I only paid a few dollars so I guess you get what you pay for."
1,Works - for 0.5 seconds.,"As soon as I plug it into my juke to listen to music, it just goes to the voice commands menu. Waste of money."
3,"It works, but it's not perfect","I got this to hook up to my phone so I could use regular headphones with it. The 3.5mm plug in works fine, but the 2.5mm plug that goes to the phone does not fit very tightly. It works, but if it gets bumped or jostled it will stop working. You just have to be careful and if you are planning on using it while running or something like that it, I do not recommend it."
4,works; afraid I'll lose it,"I bought this for my second-hand Palm Centro. It fits well in the Audio jack slot and firmly connects to my 3.5 mm jack earbuds. I don't worry that it will fall out. However, it is tiny. The right-angle 2.5 mm jack is a nice touch and makes it stick out less from the bottom of my phone."
2,Breaks fast.,I only needed this to last for a few days. It did... barely. There is an internal short in both of the ones I bought.
2,You get what you pay for...,"Purchased two. Each adapter's audio quality is poor. Songs cracked and cut out. But, I only payed $1 a piece, so I can't complain too much. Seller shipped quickly, Thank you."
1,Flimsy junk...,"The wire is too thin and ripe for breaking, the jack was bad and tore up the plug I was trying to insert into it... On the upside, the shipping was free... Don't waste your time..."
1,Get what you pay for,"I've been looking for an adapter for my 3.5 headphones to fit my 2.5 jack on my phone for a while now so, when I found this for 61 cents and no shipping needless to say I jumped at the chance... well it arrived on time and was as described appearance wise... it fit my headphones and it fit my phone BUT it did NOT work..... Oh well, you get what you pay for I guess...."
2,Does not work for cell phone retro handsets,"Purchased this to connect a retro handset to my older cell phone with a 2.5mm port. It fits, but only transmits sound through the earpiece - I can hear my caller but he can't hear me. At least it wasn't an expensive experiment."
1,made only one earphone work.,I won't be buying from this seller anymore.I have a cricket TXTM8 that needs a 2.5 jackand even though the jack was 2.5 it only made one earphone work.glad I only paid $1.10 for it + shipping.
1,Cannot get stereo.,The product arrived on time. But doesn't do what it is supposed do. I cannot get the stereo. The sound comes only in one ear.
1,Doesn't work for LG enV2 (vx-9100),This item does not work for the LG enV2 phone for playing music. It will only play one side of the output for speakers or headphones.
2,PLEASE DO NOT BUY!,"I just got this adapter and tried it out. It absolutely does not work correctly! When plugged in properly, you can only hear sound through one ear. However, I discovered that upon moving it around, you may obtain sound in both ears but only when you just insert your headphone end about halfway. This means that it can work if you are very still and do not move at all, but as soon as you move, obviously the end of your headphones will come loose. The only reason I gave it even 2 stars is because I figured out a way for it to work, but IT IS NOT THE CORRECT WAY! In reality, this product is not even worth the three dollars I paid. Once again, DO NOT BUY!"
5,phone mp3 to casset,"I've been using this to go from my MP3 player mode on my phone into a cassette for my tape deck in my car. It works great, no sound quality loss that I can tell (besides the cassette itself). The only thing is that you can't hear people talking when someone calls and you pick up. But that is good, I wouldn't want people getting instant feedback because I picked up the phone with this connected to my cars audio system. I haven't used it in any other method so I don't know if there is any talk back features for mics, but the audio works great."
2,One side of headphones only works!Bad sound quality!,I got it 2 weeks after i ordered the product.the product is very delicate.You got to be careful and i plug headphones into them and only one side of my headphones work and my headphones are brand new so it wasnt my heaphones that messed up it was the adapter.I put them into a speaker set.and only one of speakers worked.sound quality was mono.not that good.and i touched the adapter and i hear a blur in my music.like a static noise.so its delicate again.This was met for my phone but now im just gonna buy 2.5mm headphone instead plus it come with a mic.
1,Not good,"The item did not work with my phone at all. Customer Service was great! But the product did not work and I had to get a refund. I think it was not compatible with my phone. Otherwise, good product if it's compatible!"
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!!,this product is junk it barely works if you can get it to work at all. when im using it random screens pop up on my phone. its not worth the shipping don't buy it
1,beware they send you the wrong product then argue via email,"I ordered the 2.5 male adapter to 3.5 female, item #245645. Instead, I get the reverse, 3.5 male to 2.5 female, I wrote to the eforcity customer service, they asked that I submit a picture, then no response, then 24 hours later, they inform me that they shipped what I ordered, in the photo's submitted I place a mini 2.5 plug next to their supposed 2.5 and of course theirs was much larger as it is in fact a 3.5.IN SHORT - DON'T ORDER FROM THESE FOLKS - IT SEEMS THAT THEY WANT THE FAULT TO BE YOURS, INSTEAD OF THEIR INEPTNESS.I wanted to save a few dollars and now will end up paying more - and now I will go to the local Radio Shack and get the adapter that I actually want."
3,Buyer beware,The item in the picture is not what was sent. I wanted the 90 degree plug but the item I got was a straight plug instead and the item was white as well. However the adapter does work. For a penny plus 2 dollars shipping I can't complain too much.
2,Pretty basic item,I bought this item so I wouldn't have to buy new headphones for my phone at $15 a piece. Since I have two of the same phones in my household we each got one. Neither of them will allow sound to get to each one of the headphones. We can only hear sound through the headphone designated for the right ear.After letting the seller know this we were sent two replacements and we have the same problem. We will continue to use them as its better than nothing but if I want to listen to my music with both ears I am out of luck.
1,did not work with verizon voyager,this product did not work with my verizon voyager. when i pluged in my headphones the sound only came out of one speaker
1,Does not work with E71x,"Well i bought this item quite som time ago and it arrived promptly without any hassles so 5 star to Efforcity. But when I plugin my earphones into my E71x I get only mono output. I don't know why is that, but my guess is Nokia E71x produces mono sound through the earphones jack and the compatible earphone doubles up the sound. I primarily needed the converter for listening music with my favorite earphones, but will have to look for something else now."
5,"Work Great, but NOT FOR CELL PHONES","Don't be ignorant as I was when buying this - this product is not for cell phones, which require a 2.5mm male with THREE rings, not two.This adapter is for converting one-way stereo audio (TWO rings)."
1,Useless junk - doesn't work with Palm Centro,"The title just about covers it. If you have a Palm phone, don't buy this adapter. It doesn't really work (there is sound, in both ears, but for some unfathomable reason the sound quality is absolutely abysmal). Of course, you can't return it - it's not worth the shipping."
3,"Cheap product, Cheap cost","Product is pretty cheaply made, but then again I paid about $3 for 2 of them... its to be expected. Doubt it will last too long, I think I will order some of the straight(no wire) adapters that typically last longer.I ordered from LTdash LLC, which is located in NJ, and I am in PA. Took 4 days to get to my house, but that included Easter Sunday."
2,Slow to receive,"We found an adapter that fit the earphone jack and it was a good thing. These come from some far far away place and even though they said they were sorry for the wait, it was still quite awhile before we got them."
1,Dead on Arrival,"Product was a 2.5mm - 3.5mm stereo phone plug adapter (wire pigtail). I was surprised at the very light wire they used, disappointed when a metal shoulder on one of the female connectors broke off on first insertion, and fed up when neither of the two items worked at all. It's trash but so cheap it's not worth the effort to return."
3,"Eh, I don't know.","My item only played music through one ear when a 3.5mm headphone jack was plugged into it. Unless you only plugged the headphones halfway in then both ears play but some of the instruments may not be present. If you have a few bucks buy a more expensive one. Another heads up, the 2.5mm jack is not curved as it is in the products picture but is straight along with the rest of the chord. (not a problem at all to me, but some people may be looking at this) What do you expect for a dollar and change?"
2,Wont work,I got this for my xbox 360 controller so i could use my Oovan headset but when i plug everything up nothing happens. So sadly it doesnt work for what i need it for but i only paid $1 for it so i didnt lose any money really.
2,does not work for LG Octane (VN530),"i bought a couple of these to use to hook up to my LG Octane to my car stereo using a 3.5mm male jack.LG Octane---2.5mmTo3.5mmAdapter---3.5mmMaleJack---CarStereohowever, only one channel comes out (ie. only hear one side when using headphones). bummer!i bought the nokia ad-61 (also found on amazon, but, more expensive) and works to produce stereo sound (ie. you can hear both left and right headphones).you might have better luck than me in getting sound out of this adapter but they didn't work with my phone."
1,poor sound quality,"I can hook my phone with a 3.5 socket up to some speakers and get great sound. If i use these adapters with a phone that has a 2.5 socket, the sound comes out only as loud as the phone. Very poor product."
4,Does The Job,"Arrived a little late, but as-described, so no complaints! Works on my Palm Treo 650 so I can use normal headphones."
4,It only plays on the left side of headphones.,1 problem: It doesn't play on both sides of the headphones.It works just as mentioned but remember that this is mono and stereo.NOTICE HOW THE PICTURE HAS 2 STRIPES ON THE JACK (THE SILVER PART OF THE ADAPTER). YOU WANT ONE WITH 3 TO GET STEREO.This doesn't apply to regular headphones.
2,"Better than nothing, but...","This storage case would have worked OK, but the zipper was broken when we received it, so it stores the games, but cannot be closed. It would be nice if someone would make a simple, slotted plastic box that would hold 25-30 or even 50 games in one place. The individual cases are nice for day to day transport, but not functional for finding the game you want in a collection of games. Also, you cannot see the game title through the plastic. Other than throwing them in a drawer (not allowed) my sons have no convenient storage spot."
1,Mistake,Just got my order today and was disappointed. They shipped the box with a bag in it but no charm. How do you mess that order up? How do you stick a bag in a box without the charm inside??
3,Nice Charm But Falls Slightly Short,"The charm itself is perfect. The luster on the laquered shell is nice and the color really stands out against a silver charm bracelet. I felt the clasping method, however, was poorly thought out. For any charm bracelet that is robust enough to wear on a daily basis, the split ring style clasp will distort and not return to its original shap after it has been placed on the bracelet. My wife kept getting it caught on her clothes (sweaters were constantly snagging). I had to remove the split ring and replace it with a purchased locking c-jewelry clasp. I am not a fan of having to upgrade jewelry after a purchase, thuse the low star rating. The"
5,Perfect! Just what I wanted!,This was just the right size and shape for my charm bracelet. My grand-daughter loves lady bugs and this reminds me of her everytime I wear it. It is perfect - on time and just what we wanted.
3,ok,"I love ladybugs, and I bought this for my pandora bracelet and it didn't fit, I had to force the ring open with some tweezers to get it in, also the ring it comes with is not as good looking or flattering as all the other charms. The back of the ladybug is hollowed and it has the word CHINA written on it. thankfully it's not that easy to see in plain sight. Otherwise, the quality is good so far, I've had it on for three days now and everything is ok."
3,Not for Pandora,"I love this little charm...It's very cute, and does look pricy. The only problem I have is that I'll have to make alterations for it to fit my pandora bracelet. The hoop the lady bug swings from is too small to fit on my bracelet."
5,raw-k in your face!!!!!!!!!!!,"if you like fu manchu,or stoner rock(qotsa,kyuss,hermano,floating widget)get that one,it rock from the track one till the end,king of the road was my favourite album from fu manchu till that one came out,they kinda slow down fore there latest album(california crossing)but they came back with a slap in you face with start the machine,faster and a lill touch of punk to spice it up,loud crunchy and RAW!!!"
5,strong fu release,"the fu can do no wrong. i've been a fan since 1991 and this is a great album. scott r is an awesome drummer, following well in brant's style and there are very well constructed songs here with the usual great riffs and lead. best songs: hey, it's all the same and i wanna be."
2,MONGOOSE AND PIGEON TOE,"Returning once again to the candy metal shenanigans of TAIG and CC, Fu Manchu have apparently reneged on the promising power resurgence of KOTR--probably for good. Age has a way of mellowing even the hardest of metal tacticians. For those who wish to revel in Fu's pinnacle of power, please seek out the Eatin' Dust EP from 1999. The last two songs, as cited in the header, form one of the heaviest, most primordial one-two punches in the entire metal canon."
1,Possibly the most awful tribute album ever made,"There is literally not one track on this album to recommend. The Blasters' musicdoes not do well in the hands of others, particularly these others. Buy the real thing instead."
4,Good job,I bought the item form Eforcity. It is unbelievably inexpensive for how well it works. Since it let me use my headset for my cell phone.
4,"OK, but doesn't work with microphone","Bought two of these for my children's W300i in December. So far, both are working fine for headphones. But, they do not work for ""headsets"" as advertised. According to wiki, a ""headset"" includes a mic."
1,Stay Away!,I ordered 2 of those which never received and seller never replies emails!Stay away not recommended.
1,public service announcement,I just want to let potential buyers of this product know that this adapter does not seat properly into my W760a phone. I bought three knowing they don't last long but they are so cheaply made they don't even work unless you hold them in place physically or with tape or a rubber band. I'm not a person to return a 2 dollar item but i am unsatisfied enough to write this message. even at two bucks these are a rip off. don't say I didn't warn you!
4,Radio for Sony Ericsson w580i,Radio component when my previous one broke in a flag football game. Here's a clue don't play football and listen to the radio at the same time! Unlike the more expensive version this one does not give you the option to have wireless phone calls and only is a headset jack interface. Mine only works for one ear bud (where music comes into) just like the original one ear jack & wireless phone option. I play the radio on speaker or if at work deal w/ the one ear bud working thingy. Its ok. It works.
1,Do not buy this product,Do not buy this product. I have bought three separate products from Eforcity. All three broke within two months of use.
2,Bought 5,"I've purchased 5 of these in the time space of a year. Every single one of them broke. They sound great and do the job when you first get them. But after a few minor tugs here and there, there goes the sound. I'm basing the 2 stars on the price and the time that they each lasted for, 2 months. Oh and if you buy 2. u get charge 2 shipping charges, even though they can clearly fit about 20 in the cheap packaging without an issue."
1,Do not buy,"As soon as i bought it i knew this thing sucked. I have to force this product into my phone and i am putting it in right. The headphone jack is two small i have to force all my headphone related products into it. I tried regular headphones and the headphone to tape thing for my car, both were a terrible fit. Listen to the reviews and don't buy it."
1,Worthless,"This was the most wrothless thing I've ever bought on amazon. I bought this for my Sony Ericsson, which only lasted a month before it broke. Right out of the package this never fit what it was supposed to. I would of returned it, but I figured that the shipping would've cost more than the product itself. Waste of time & money."
5,Great for the car,"I got this to connect my phone to my car stereo. It's much easier to have hanging around than the one that comes with the phone. No microphone, so calls won't work, but you're in the car, so why should they?"
3,works,"the head set works well with my sony phone. the only complaint i have is that the ""radio tuner"" feature on my phone doesn't work well with this product. the original plug that comes with my phone works better because the plug actually acts as an antennae for the tuner. this after-market one doesn't hand the antennae duties at all, but the headphone part works fine. i use it often enough."
4,Makes aftermarket hookups easy,"Quick shipping, had some trouble at first, guess the connectors didn't hit just right the first couple times. But it works great. Originally got it so I could use rca plugs to connect to my car stereo. Being as they were so cheap I ordered two just incase something happened. But still working fine."
3,"Glitchy, bro.",The adaptor frequently comes loose and easily loses connection with my phone. Pretty annoying for someone who simply wants to enjoy some music.
4,Works great...,Bought this for my girlfriend's phone so she could listen to music on it.. Very stupid you had to get this for a Walkman Phone.. Great Price and worked as intended..
4,Headset Adapter for K800i phone,I purchased this adapter for my Sony Ericsson k800i phone. The adapter is required if you plan on using the radio feature of the phone as the radio can only be used with headphones. The adapter also as an antenna. The cable works great and I have not had any issues with it. You can plug in any 3.5mm stereo audio earphones.
2,Not too pleased,"I received my adaptors but one wasn't working. I forgot to tell the seller that one was not working. but overall I was satisfied, for now."
3,Sony Headphone Adapter,"This product didn't work as well as I had hoped and I coincidentally do not own the phone anymore. It did not secure a connection with the mobile phone as well as I would have expected and therefore was frequently having to secure and resecure the connection to the side of the phone. Overall it did the job when I wasn't active or mobile and therefore would not be good to buy this product if you plan to use it while jogging, running, or exalting excessive energy on the move."
3,"Works fine, and the price is right","This does exactly what I expected - it works as a cheap replacement for the stock hands-free attachment, as long as you ONLY use that attachment to listen through headphones.This is much shorter than the stock hands-free cord, and has neither the microphone nor the talk button to allow you to answer calls while using headphones. The decreased length also means that, without headphones attached, your FM radio reception will be slightly worse than with the longer cord of the stock hands-free unit.Fit and finish are not as nice as the original--I was very nervous the first time I put this unit in, as it didn't seem to fit, and I almost had to force it. However, it has gotten much easier since then, with no ill effects on my phone so far.Bottom line: you can't beat the price!"
2,Cheap,"I bought this adapter for my TM 506. At first I thought I bought the wrong one because it didn't fit in the phone, but eventually I realized it was just hard to push in. It is really cheaply built, so sometimes it cuts out. Pretty lame, buy I don't think there's much of an alternative."
1,"Cheap, junk, broke immediately","I was very careful with this product because i read in other reviews that it is flimsy. Two of the connector teeth broke off immediately, and it would not stay connected tight enough to maintain connection. Sound was horrible using this connector, and it was a waste of time to even order this."
3,"Works well, but doesn't last long.","This device is dirt cheap, which makes it worth buying because you can get several of them. You'll need them too, because they don't last very long. I've gone through about 4 of them over the last 2 years so you should expect about 6 months out of it. The sound quality is good and there doesn't seem to be any interference while it's still in good condition, but when it starts to short you might hear static or lose a channel of audio. The plastic clips sometimes break and the wire shorts out after a while. Still, for the price, they're a good buy."
3,Works but not for portability!,"This item works to my surprise, but once you plug it in, its a giant piece of plastic stickign straight out of your phone.. I use the w810i and if I were to take this running, it just feels awkward to have it sticking out. If you really need it, you should get it, its worth the price. Just make sure you have enough space for music (get enough memory)."
3,SE W518,"The wire between the connections is a little on the flimsy side so the first day I cut a strip of plastic wire wrap and reinforced the wire. The input connect to the phone needs to be lined up exactly before pressed into phone and is a little tight at first, but could be easily broken if not careful. My phone has a FM radio and needs a headphone jack for an antenna and this works great with out headphones attached, just switch to speakerphone in that mode. The sound quality through headphones attached is a little quiet, but I bought this to to play the MP3's off the stereo and that is loud enough to make up the difference. So the reasons I would recommend spending $3 on this device is if you: A)Want an antenna for the FM radio in the phone or B)Want to connect to the stereo to play mp3's. For the headphones with a mic I went for a Sony Ericsson W518a Black Left/Right Ear loop Hands-Free Headset from [...] only cost $9 and has better sound quality but not offered through Amazon."
5,Sony Ericsson Headset Adapter,This is a must have adapter if you want to use the AUX input in your car with your Sony Ericsson. It works great
2,Ughhh!,It was a pain because the sound quality sucked even though i don't really pay attention to it and it also kept popping off the phone so i would have to hold it in order for it not to fall..I didnt really expect for it to be perfect since the price is so low. You get what you pay for
2,Unsure,"I recently purchased this item. I used it for less than 1 week and it worked just fine. Buy today when I plug my headphones into them, the left headphone does not play any sound. I requested and exchange or refund from the provider and I am awaiting a response. I would recomend this product only if my replacement request is met."
4,Great customer service.,"When I recieved the adapter I plugged it in and I got static through my headphones and my car stereo that I didn't get with the sony/ericsson original equipment. From the looks of the other reviews this seems to be the exception, not the rule.When I told Eforcity that I wasn't happy with this product the company refunded my money no questions asked."
1,Avg durability is less than a month,"This product is exactly what I needed to fully enjoy my SE w580i's walkman and stereo FM capabilities.Unfortunately it is very flimsy.For a daily commuter, the average durability is less than a month.I have already bought 6 units but cannot find a better quality product."
1,"JUNK - Mic does NOT work, broke on the first day!!!!","As soon as I got it, it seemed flimsy, it does not work with a mic/headset and after using it about 4 times it broke. The pins became very loose and yes I know how to remove it properly like the rest of the sony adapters.DO NOT BUY!"
5,great accessory,"I love Sony Ericsson phones and would never buy any other brand, but because of its proprietary headphone jack, I never used to use my c905a for music. With this accessory, I get to use my Sony Ericsson to its full capacity. The product is solid and a great value. I especially like the small size. It barely adds any bulk to the connection between phone and headphones."
1,The picture lies.,"The seller sent an adapter that routes the cable awkwardly perpendicular to the side of the phone instead of neatly parallel to the side of the phone, which is what the product picture promised. The wire is flimsy - I don't think it will last very long."
1,avoid - sucks the life out of the sound quality of your phone/headphones,"Don't even waste the $2 to try this garbage out. Use the Sony plug. The sound quality is extremely reduced. If you've never used the sony attachment, you would think your phone sound is terrible or your headphones are terrible. Without a doubt, this plug produces undesirable sound. I don't even give it one star, but amazon forced me too."
3,One word: overrated!,"When I saw these sessions had been reissued, I pulled out the 2-record set on which they had first been released, the 1978 ABC Impulse album The Dedication Series Vol. VII: The Village Concerts, and listened to it again. While I love Ayler's quavery, gospel-tinged tone, his technical limitations ultimately get in his way, and he ends up treading a very narrow stylistic path. The songs never really develop, and when Ayler is not playing the other musicians seem lost. For a better example of free tenor playing mixed with a solid command of the instrument, check out Sam Rivers' trio release in this same reissue series."
3,"Fanfare, or free jazz ?","That's always the question when a song starts.And the answer comes soon, as always with Albert Ayler.In short : good, but not as well inspired as in Witches & Devils."
5,Technique?,"Ayler was a pioneer of sound and emotion on his instrument, making him an inventive virtuoso, and if you ever get to hear any of his ill-conceived late sixties fusion albums you'll hear that he can sound better than Maceo Parker at the drop of a hat. But who cares?! This is music of great emotional depth and spirituality, technical debates aside."
3,good,soy un fan de esta obra en todas las verciones en mi opinion esta version y la de mexico no son muy buenas que digamos pero las voces tampoco son muy buenas que digamos pero pasan
3,the best judas,no way nobody and i say it again nobody sings the judas part like Murray Head and nobody plays jesus like ian gillan and thats enough.Although the camilo sestos version is not bad at all
1,Are you sure?,Are you all sure that this game works? I don't think it does. I think all of you are just lying. You seem calm after knowing this game actually works! Please tell me the truth.
3,Tried it and it worked,"They wouldn't ship to Croatia, so I had it shipped to a USA address and then re-shipped. Pain in the butt. When it finally came, we tried it and it worked (althou none of the things ""said"" happened so far). We protected the workspace with a circle of rice. After the session remember to pick up all the rice and throw it into a running water (a river in our case). We only used it once. As for product itself, we had candles burning so I dont know how long it would have glowed in the dark. Also, the board is a bit on the smaller size."
4,"More than two people, but probably more...","Nothing happens, or at least nothing with just two people... we tried and tried... nothing. I wish it were cheaper, my mother was really excited but really let down... she was too open minded me thinks."
5,Ouiga Boards Are For Real!,"Once about 8 years ago, my mom and my cousin were playing with the ouiga board. My other cousin was there in the room and he told my mom to ask it when he was going to jail. It said ""tonight"". He said to ask it where he will be, It said "" at Chris's house"". He had planned on going there that night, but changed his mind. Later they posed the same question to the board-when was he going to jail, it again said ""tonight"". I was on 3rd shift and went to work. I came home at lunch, and there were police officers surrounding my mom's house. Guess what. He went to jail THAT NIGHT! My mom got so scared she burned the ouiga board. I still like to play around with them though. I can't help it, it is interesting."
4,regretting,this thing really works and i regret buying it because ever since i started playing bad happenings has been happening all around me
3,SO NOT COOL!,listen I'm a Christian not Catholic not but listen i play with ouija board's and my best friend i told her i was not catholic and she told me that i would not go to heaven for that so you no what ouija can be good and bad i think i've been stabbed in the face with the sword of religion so anyone who likes it fine people who don't fine who really cares i like it you may not it's just a game!
1,paid for it but never got it,im paid for this item but it has yet to come to my home. it has been over a month and i still have NOT gotten it. I AM VERY MAD
1,Warning,"Just a little tip. Not to scare you guy's off but i'm a Wiccan and i have much interest in Spirituality.. A word of advice: Never use the board alone, Never talk about god and especially DON'T ASK WHEN U DIE. I know this might as well sound stupid.. But i'm sorry it's true. Always have someone with you who knows how to do this stuff. Or start learning and get books first.. Then buy this.Many Blesses,Bryan,"
3,FICTION OR FANTISY,"The Ouija board was intended to be a playful spiritual game.I too have played this game, when I was a kid. If you believe in the answer to the question you've asked it, you've asumed the answer to be true. I really don't think it's a bad game, it's all on how you precieve your answers to the unusual questions you may have asked it."
1,SCARY EXPERIANCES WHILE USING OUIJA,"A LONG TIME AGO ME AND MY BEST FRIEND GOT A OUIJA BOARD AND DECIDED TO PLAY IT AT HER HOUSE IN THE DARK. WHAT A MISTAKE! SO WE SET THE GAME UP, LIT CANDLES AND STUFF. 8 MINS INTO THE GAME, I HEARD A KNOCKING SOUND AT THE DOOR IN ONE OF HER SPARE ROOMS. SO WE WENT TO CHECK IT OUT; THINKING IT WAS HER SISTER OR BROTHRS PLAYING A TERRIBLE TRICK ON US. NOTHING WAS THERE. THEN, WE FELT REALLY COLD AIR RUSH TRHOUGH THE ROOM, AND WE BOTH GOT A COLD UNEASY FEELING LIKE WE WERE BEING WATCHED. FROM THIS DAY FORWARD, IM AFRAID OF THE DARK, AND IM AFRAID TO GO INTO ANYWHERE DOWNSTAIRS, ALL BECAUSE OF OUIJA. I KNOW MY STORY SOUNDS LAME AND NON REAL, BUT ITS TRUE. 2 YEARS LATER AT THE AGE OF 14 I FEAR OUIJA BECAUSE OF MY BAD EXPERIANCES. DONT BUY OUIJA."
2,It does work... but ask benign questions,"Hi, I came across these reviews and decided to write about my personal story with it- 28 years after the fact. It works. When I was 11 going on 12, a girlfriend had a slumber party. The board was out and candles were lit, then they flickered hen the questions started. Two questions are vivid in my mind: I asked: Who will I marry?""(remember how young I was) The response was ""Leo"". Another friends asked ""How old will I be when I die?"" The response was ""17"" At that point everyone freaked out completely and we stopped playing. I don't remember the other questions, but these are the facts after the experience:- I married a man whose father's name is Leonel (and, no, I have never had a thing for my father-in-law)- The girl whom I was friends with ended up going to a different middle school and high school. She died in a horrible car accident at the age of 17.It is real and it is definitely not for kids."
3,for you religous folks....,"for all you people who are saying that if you are good and don't play with magic and all that, you will go to heaven. how do you know there even is a heaven? then all your praying and living like that would be pointless. please consider that..."
2,Screwed over with plastic,"If your really interested in buying a Ouija Board that will last a good couple of years,this one isn't for you.Buy one that is actually wood.This ones just plastic on paper.I wasted [my money] on something that isn't really fun by yourself.My advice:don't get one to actually use;only buy one for the [heck] of it(remember,get a real one and not this one!!)"
3,The Ouija board,"My daughter really wanted this and we have used it a few times , not quiet how I remember mine being but it does the trick . Kids enjoy the thought of being able to ask questions to a board."
1,ouija board,i bought it because my son asked for it. would never buy for myself. my son liked it and thought it was cool.
1,Here's some advice for those who use it--DON'T.,"Trust me, if you use a Ouija board, do NOT. Those who do do not know what they are messing with. This board is used as commonly as tarot cards, and for the same purpose, too. I've never used one, but I know what I'm saying. Those of you who befriend spirits by means of this board, break all ties with them, because this ""board game"" is Satanically inspired. Only pure evil can come from a device such as this. Seriously, if you use this thing frequently, you are inviting evil into your home.Some say that this board is actually controlled by your subconscious thoughts, but I'd rather not take any chances and invite a succubus, or something even worse, into my home. Trust me, you're messing with things that it would be in your best interest NOT to mingle with. If you want a board game, get Monopoly. (P.S: Monopoly rocks, too!)"
1,This is not a toy,"Do not let this thing in your house. It may seem like an innocent game but the fact is it's not. It's EVIL and the spirit's it contacts are evil not good. 6 years ago my 48 year old cousin was innocently playing with an Ouija board, at a party, and became possessed by an evil spirit. She had to be exorcised"
2,Religions,"I am christian, and i dont think that it is superior to other religions. just because you use the board doesnt mean u are an atheist. The parke brothers version isnt as bad as others because the symbolysm and style is different. So if u think ure goin to hell if u play with this, dont do it!!! otherwise, have fun!"
4,About the kids review for burning in hell,Ok first of all THERE ARE OTHER RELIGIONS OFFERING SALVATION I AM CATHOLIC AND CHRISTIAN BUT THE ONES WHO WILL BURN IN HELL WILL ALSO BE BIAS PEOPLE LIKE YOU AND MANY OTHERS SO IF U SAY DONT BE DUMB OR ULL BURN IN HELL HOW DO YOU THINK ULL TURN OUT?

3,ouija great but bad....????,hey all i am a wiccan and have use the board for over 2 years now and yes im only 16 but a great channeler anywho i bought my frist board without promisstion from toy r us and use it for a while getting great answer most where true but some where just way off so the board can be unreliable so dont put your trust into it but aprouch it with an open mind (...) it is possable for you to get in contact with truthful spirits on the ouija it is just a mtter of time and consentration...and wither you are giveing off bad energy....also IF A SPIRIT FEELS BAD TO YOU PUT THE BOARD AWAY FOR THE NIGHT cuz it wont leave till then then next time you come to the board make sure not to think of the passed times on the board cuz thats whats going to come trough.....so yewa thank you for reading hopes this helps(...)
3,i'm still laughing!,"After reading the previous reviews, I had to write one too. I'm just wondering why our illiterate, Satan-fearing reviewer was looking up Ouija boards in the first place? I mean, I think the theory that the devil is in league with Parker Brothers is entertaining, but I'm not really sure when Mexico became the ""Darkside."" Someone needs to call George Lucas immediately. Just a side note, chess is a battle game that teaches the use of strategy in war. I have nothing against chess, it's just interesting that you would recommend this as an alternative. So, I guess it's time to throw away my Monopoly and Clue, cancel my vacation to Puerto Vallerta and start looking for your recommeded reading, ""How to Avoid Hell,"" which, coincidently, is not available on Amazon. Hmm, I wonder why?"
1,This Sucks,You think your getting something that moves on its own but all it is is plastic it is crsp i give the a 2 thumbs down!20 dollars for plastic is a rip off!!!
3,freaky fun!,"a bit more flimsy than the old ouiji boards, but still a barrel full of teenage girl screams and giggles...."
3,"Yes Yes: Oui (French) Ja (German),","I grew up in a strict family, and we played with the Ouija board. We initially saw it as being like ghost storys, but then got bored with it. It always led to arguments as to who was pushing the planchette. We heard rumors that if you throw a Ouija board into the fireplace, you would hear the devil scream. We thought this was silly, but of course had no fireplace to try the truth of the matter for ourselves. This is a game where you need one or more partners to play with, so you can't play it by yourselves.The glow in the dark aspect is cool though, and I'm considering buying it for a Christmas gift. Having to spell out our messages, which we did as deliberate jokes, probably honed our reading skills, which makes me a regular book buying customer of Amazon.com."
1,missing pieces,"too much trouble to send it back, not to ,mention it was delayedvery disappointed with this productshould be replaced"
5,the best ever!!!,This is the best Ouija board ever! One time i asked it to call my house and the phone rang with no one else on the other line. I made a friend named Steve and he gives me answers to my homework. TRY IT!!!!
5,LOL Fun-ny Game,"I loved it. I played a trick on my friend with it. I prtended to be like taken over be a sprit and said like ""I am comming after you"", and like ""you are not going to get away this time"" I had a blast. But it is even more fun to ask it qustions and then move it but say you arn't. I would only let kids play it if they are 10 or older. Because you never know if a real sprit will cotact you or not. The glow-in-the-dark one, I think, is much cooler than the orginal one, because you can turn out the lights and still see the board."
5,Scaarryyyy,"Let me tell you that the ouija board is fun and all, but it can get scary when you really get into it. I got an ouija board for my birthday last year on December 13th (yes, Friday the 13th), and we were going to try out the board. We talked to this little boy named Tim and he was 7 years old when he died. Tim told us to keep track of where we go because he said there was a demon following us. Tim said the demon is the person who killed him. I think the demon's name was John or something, I truly don't remember. I had my birthday party the next day, and we went to the movies and I felt something breathing down my back. I turned around, and the seat was empty, so I thought there would be a breeze or something in the theater. When the movie was over, everything was fine but that night my cousin and I went on the board to talk to Tim and he was gone."
4,Just for fun,"This arrived in a timely manner and we use it for fun. I can be very entertaining, but if someone is gullible, it can scare you."
3,ouiga board,purchased this for my grandson-age 12. Played with this game many years ago and we all had fun with it.
1,Tiny piece of junk,"Hello there. I've been a collector of Ouija boards for many years. They keep getting smaller and junkier. They used to be almost two feet wide and now they're barely 12 inches. Ouija boards are alive and well, but not the ones made by Parker Brothers. You would be much better off getting a handmade wooden board for just a little more than this cardboard and plastic piece of junk. Just go to Google and search for ""wooden ouija board"" and find one there. Don't waste your money on Parker Brothers. And, keep in mind that this IS a game. Don't miss out on a fun game because of religion. Greed is a sin too, but Christians can still play Monopoly. You don't have to worship the devil to play with a Ouija board. Silly, silly reviewers. :-)"
4,The Ouija Board,"I've played this game all my life and I have always loved it. It doesn't work the first time you play it but you really have to believe in the unknown to get the spirits to answer you. Don't play around with it, it's not a game. But also don't take it too seriously or you'll start basing your decisions on it and it might not make you do the right things. I think it's a really good thing to have when you're looking for answers and it's a lot of fun. The glow in the dark feature is really cool and it sets the mood when you're playing. To get answers from your board it is important that you relax and concentrate only on your question. Try to clear your mind of everything else. The Ouija Board is my favorite game and I thank my aunt for introducing it to me."
3,Uh...what am I doing wrong?,"I love spooky stuff, i thought this would be fun considering the reveiws. I wish with all my might that it would work, but it simply won't. I tried and tried, nothing happened. Even the slightest movement took ages. I followed all directions, concentrated, cleared my mind, etc, but it won't work! I think it was a waste of money. Maybe if someone could tell me how to really work it, I would change my mind. I'm not saying don't buy it, but I just don't know how to work the thing."
2,Ideomotor Effect: The Game,"I'm very saddened that so many people are scared of this silly toy, look up the Ideomotor Effect. Yes, I was creeped out too as a little, uninformed kid. Then I learned science. Now, if someone has this, then have a Ouija session with the participants BLINDFOLDED (with an observer or videocamera recording the results). Now, what does it spell?"
3,They don't make 'em like they used to?,"The glow-in-the-dark version consists of a paper-covered cardboard game board and a plastic ""planchette"". The board art looks cool enough, but the planchette doesn't slide very well, making it harder to cheat convincingly enough to scare your child into cleaning their room. I vaguely remember the board from when I was a kid being actual chipboard with some sort of laminated surface that was pretty slippery. Just like the version I played with back in the day, the letters on the board are too close to the edge, making it hard to spell anything without the legs of the planchette sliding off. (Except for ""Goodbye"", in which this is the desired effect.) Still waiting for Captain Howdy to move it all by himself."
2,not like it used to be,"Ouija boards, at one time, were mysterious and mystical to play. This new version has a great box and cover, recalling those intense hours of the future of my youth. the contents in this version is cheap, made entirely of flimsy cardboard. It does not live up to its promising cover"
5,freaky....,"Spirits really talk to me, it works as long as you truly believe it works. It's been in several cultures for thousands of years and they've found it successful. Never ask serious questions about your future or its past. This is definitely not for kids under 10, this is no plain game. Remember not to put ANY pressure on the control.."
5,Mystifying ouija,"The ouija board is not a toy.....I'm only 13 and I know this already. DO NOT let your children under 13 play with this UNLESS they know what can happen. Yes, you could get posessed but highly unlikely. There's a good chance your house will have spirits after using this board, so PLEASE know how to close realms before you decide to use the ouija board."
5,I Love This Thing,I love this thing. It told me that the one boy I liked will ask me out on the first day of school. I was soooooooooooo happy. I just can't wait until school comes. It also told me that I will die at age 96 from onmonia. This thing freaks me out. I want this thing either for Christmas or I really want it NOW!!!!!!!!!I just love Ouija Boards. I love them because it tells me things I really wanted to know. It also makes me happy and makes me laugh that is why I really want one and why I love OUIJA BOARDS!!
1,Glow in dark ouija board,Was sent the wrong item was sent a cheaper regular board.want to send it back on there dime or give me the $6.00 difference.
5,awesome ouija,"This is a must have,if u belive in this stuff. If u don't it doesn't work. It is so amazing and i could personally play it all day if u get a good spirit. also dont lose the plastic thing with the nail in it. If u do it might not work. so defitnally buy this. But...it is not a game. do not joke around. so many times this thing has benn acurate...."
1,Interesting,"As a prospective buyer, I looked forward to reading some customer reviews, I hoped to find out what this GAME is about, maybe even some directions and I found that the review of said GAME, MADE BY FLIPPIN' PARKER BROTHERS, has turned into a heated religious debate over who, what, and how to be Christian or otherwise...all of you people trying to top one another's arguments, while trying to appear believable, when most of you cannot go as far as spelling words correctly. Interesting. Stop thinking that everybody hates you and what you stand for and blog your preachings somewhere else! Thanks."
4,Fun!,It's a great way to scare your friends who have never played before and have a good time. I love Ouija boards!
3,? - anyone modified the feet with felt? Can one person use it?,"Hi, was thinking of getting this more for display however after reading several reviews I thought of a couple of things-1. Some complain about durability of the glow surface from using the board- the planchette feet are rubber not felt? Has anyone modified the feet of the planchette successfully (little socks? lol- would the spirts like that?) so as not to damage the surface?2. Has anyone used this alone, as one person? If so what were the results?If I do decide to get this (had one in my 20s) I will then write my review of the item.thanks."
3,It really works.,"This is very real it, and it is NOT a toy. It may seem like fun, but many people who use this thing often eventually get involved in the occult (not everyone, but you run that risk if you use it enough). I would really not recomend using it. Even though it is not a ""devil communicator,"" you are communicating with demons, not spirits. Ouija Board users: If you don't believe me, ask your ""spirits"", in the name of Jesus Christ, if they're demons. Don't doubt me until you ask. These boards are very real and very dangerous. Demons are not something to mess around with, and there is only one way to get rid of them."
4,Lots of Fun,I think that this is alot of fun. It not bad and is something you would definetly enjoy. Mostly older kids would like it though. Overall it is alot of fun and you should buy it.
2,Good,"I bought this for my 14 year old son for his birthday. It is more of a collector's item, but I couldn't find any ""new"" games on the market. The seller represented it well in their ad. I was pleased with the overall purchase, and it shipped quickly."
1,WARNING!!! This is not a game or a toy!!! DANGEROUS!!!,"Anyone who says that a Ouija Board is just a toy or a game does not know what he is talking about. Anyone who says that it is not dagerous has not yet had a bad experience from using one. I have had a very bad experience and the only way to get relief from it was to start going to church!By the way, William Fuld who marketed this ""game"" in the early 1900's went to court to prove that it was an occult device and not a game! And, the court ruled that it was not a game!These ""spirits"" that operate the board are called demons and demons are bad or evil or whatever you want to call them. They are no good. Don't let your children ever use them! Make them stop. And don't ever use one!Anyone who says you can use them safely are either fools or liars. These New Agers are misguided souls turning to evil spirits instead of God.This is no joke! Please take my advice!"
1,You all are crazy.,"All of the reviews warning people not to use this particular board make me laugh. This board is JUST PLASTIC AND CARDBOARD! They are all made in the factory where all of our favorite dolls and board games are made. They are all made the way Monopoly and other fun games are made. They can't be posessed because you would need to have the board cursed by a witch person. They are made by the thousands just as all other toys are. I bought this and you have to move the pointer yourself and the board overall is just basically nothing. It is like paper and pencil. However, there are homemade boards you can buy on eBay that are posessed and that are dangerous. But I think it is ridiculous that some supernatural being would want to hang out in a peice of cardboard for all eternity."
1,Terrible,This game was not fun at all and I don't think I will be buying from amazon ever again...complete waste of money
1,"Sorry, its not exactly about the game...","Look, I've been reading about reviews but, alot of them are'nt about toy. For crying out loud!! One of these reviews has book listings for books about God. Okay I'm Cathiolic but please don't judge me! One of the things most people don't like are judging them by RELIGION. So everybody come on stop doing this to people like me. Oh and guess what? I'm 10 and I'm correcting people's mistakes.Atheist is fine with me,so's jewish,I just don't care!"
1,what??,"oh my gosh- a ouija board aint a toy, come on im 13 and i no that. youve got to be so careful cos you dont no who you could be contacting! i read somewhere that if youve got an evil spirit that it can haunt for for years and years! my mum also said when you do it dont b silly and start laffin and askin the spirit silly questions cos it could get angry. my mums friend also told me not to ask it about death and that, but i dont no whether its tru or not, never asked one lol. me n my friend did a home made one today in my house which is haunted. the glass didnt move but we herd bangs and when asked whether it could nok 2 times for female and 1 time for male, we got 2 noks. we also found out that it was young(under 18) and we felt tingling on our skins! freaky! and before you start ask for protection against bad spirits or things could turn nastycya"
1,Fake,"I played this, it made no sense at all..The thing didnt move at all. I played with my lovely boyfriend and nothing happened,no ghosts came out nothing happened, It wasnt movieing its just a urban legend to trick you."
1,"THIS IS NOT A GAME !!!, Highly Dangerous.","Do use people know how dangerous a ouija board is, my good i can't beleave use recommend this ""game"" for 8 years and up....Do u know that useing a ouija board, can bring fourth very strong and powerful demons...when useing the ouija board, when u call upon a spirit, 7 spirits come forward...this spirits are confused and dangerous and have probabaly died of a terrible death, eg, suicide, murder, etc etc.i myself am a paranormal investigator... and i have seen what troubles it has brought for people...this game should be banned....spirits take more advantage of young children, espically when they go into puberty...u have been warned, this game can lead demonic posseoin...or u can have a demon follow you around and drain ur energy"
1,PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS!,"I am a mother of three and wish that people would stop selling this as a toy because this will never be a toy.When I was a teenager I had a ouiji board and life was never the same after.I became obsessed and used it on my own alone it worked by myself but a grave mistake it was.I went through hell.The movie the exocist is based on a child using a ouiji board it is a true story.Whether you believe in the supernatural or not don't take the risk I was a naive teenager then,now I know the consequences, but it was a severe price to pay."
1,Ouija Board is demonistic.,"About a year ago me and a couple of my friends were at had a party and decided it would be fun to play with a Ouija Bored. We were sure it was just fun, not evil like some people believe. So we asked it stupid questions like who we were going to marry and stuff and it didn't appear to work. Then I suggested we ask the Ouija Board what it was because I was curious if it would work. The answer we recieved was ""Be not afraid. I am demon."" I have never touched one since because I know the truth. For awhile after that night I always felt like someone was behind me watching me. Now it is only once in a very long while. I opened a door I shouldn't have and there is no way to close it. All this is the truth told by a 16 year old American girl who wants to help others from making her mistakes."
1,BE CAREFUL!!!,This game is not a good game! It is very dangerous and can do bad things thjat can change your life! Do not buy it! Its not cool! Take my advice and stay away unless you want to risk something.
2,This is No Game,"I am 38 years old and played with an Ouija board when I was 7 and it has disturbed me ever since. This is no game. It is fooling around with something you don't want to mess with. Please don't introduce your children or grandchildren to it. It does work by demonic power, not the power of angels. It may seem like a whole lot of fun but it is dangerous to say the least. This ""game"" should be sold in back alleys, not reputable toy stores."
1,THIS BOARD IS POSSESED!,"ONetime, I saw these people, and they were all possesed by the ouiji board, and they were all saying weird things, And my uncle playd it and it scared him to death, because they asked questions and the board actually new the right answer... So only get the board if you wanna take a risk of being possesd and being scared."
1,don't be so sure.,"okay. this is more than a game. games dont move around on themselves and talk to you. It has worked for me and my friends and it is bad news. They are not real spirits, they could say anything to trick you. When you are dead, you go either to heaven or hell, you dont stay around and talk to ouija boards. God would not do that with spirits, but satan would with his to trick them. Be careful guys, it's some sort of strange force that causes it and it is not ""just a game"". Wether you are religious or not, you can not deny stuff that has really happened due to those boards. It's satanic wether u believe in it or not. do your research"
3,Whoa!,"Okay, I've only used this game twice, it's really fun and all, but CREEPY! My grandma, my mom, and I put out all the lights and lit candles and things. So, we're playing the game, and to test it, we ask a couple of questions of names, it gets all of them right! It was soooo weird. It's REALLY FUN, just scary at times!"
4,ouija,"Firstly, it is really insulting [to me] when people speak or write of pop psychology, when they are absolutely ignorant of the profession of psychology (as my parents are not --they both have PhD's). Those who speak of the unexplainable, in my own opinion, are most likely of ignorant and weak minds. I don't like making assumptions, but I believe this is a safe one. I've had a Ouija for years, it's fun, it's made by parker bros...And nothing unusual has happened, of course, initially it was weird, but w/ logic....it was simple"
3,Ouija,"It's fun but didn't work. There are some who say you shouldn't dabble in the unknown, but as far as I'm concerned, it's still unknown."
5,Got what I wanted.,"I'm not sure how to review this since it's pretty basic what you're getting. The glow in the dark Ouija board (Which does glow super bright and evenly, however I prefer not to sit in the dark to use this.)Don't believe everything people tell you about superstition and that these boards printed with letters actually spawn demons. It's fun for a few friends to get together and use it. Hell, I've played it with my mother. It's entertaining for a while and it's always creepy when you get words or names you wouldn't understand, then you look it up and it means something creepy.After I placed my order, it was shipped immediately and I got it only the day after it shipped!"
2,Any Ouija equals a big no-no,"Any Ouija board game is NOT a toy and should not be bought as one, unless you are not a believer!"
1,DONT USE OUIJA BOARDS!,please dont use ouija boards. They are very VERY dangerouse. They bring negative spirits into the atmoshpere and people get haunted by those spirits. PLEASE LISTEN TO MY WARNING!
1,... board,"i tried the quija board out cause i thought it would be really cool if it actually worked. my wife has seen people use one before and she believes that they really work. so one day we bought one then that night we took it out. turned out the lights and gave it a try. we must have sat there for half and hour and nothing at all happened. i was already somewhat of a skeptic even though my wife said she saw it work before. but this just reassured me that i was indeed right, they don't work unless someone moves them. as far as fun, well if nothing happens its not really fun now is it? as far as educational goes, i learned two things. not to believe that something is real just cause someone tells you it is, and that i wasted my money on a goofy glow in the dark piece of cardboard and a piece of plastic. and durabily...well, its plastic and cardboard so its not exactly child resilient."
1,IT'S A REAL BOARD!!!!,"This board is real!!!! You wouldnt suspect that from a toy company would you? I wouldnt, but bad things happen when you use it. When u use it, You allow spirits to come into yur house. Good Or Evil, Theyll come in. Im not gonna risk trying this, but the reason i know about it is because I know someone who got this. The bad part is, that the evil spirits can possess you. That explains all of the death stories here..."
3,TOY? I THINK NOT!,"Let me start off by saying I am big on spiritual contact and they make this look like a toy! People have been reported to have been driven insane by things like this and it is anything but a game. Another thing is the fact that you don't have to buy this, but more simply make one yourself out of wood. Just simply carve the letters into the wood and some key phrases, then simply find something to use as a pointer. It works even better because really the board is made of cardboard, not some magical substance.-Just remember, this is NOT a game!"
2,Ouija Bored is boring,I bought the board but it was very lame. It wouldn't show real words unless I moved my self. Don't waste you money buying this toy.
1,missing pieces,"got this brand new, factory sealed from amazon. there are barely any pieces to the thing to begin with, yet somehow the jerks at Hasbro managed to not put in the little rubber/plastic feet that make the thing slide across the board. job well down folks...classy...this is of course in no way, shape or form amazon's fault, it's Hasbro's fault."
1,RIP OFF!!! Didn't include ghosts!!,"Everyone else claims that their board comes with spirits or - better still - demons! So I eagerly bought one, hoping to finally find definitive proof of the supernatural. Boy was I disappointed to find all this toy did was perfectly demonstrate the ideomotor effect ... I feel cheated."
3,Ouija is OK,"I haven't found anyone to participate with me yet. Hmmm...not sure why, lol. The package arrived in great condition, brand new."
5,Weirdos!,"yes, like everyone is sayiing, its a toy you evil people! you can't stop havin fun because 'god' wants you to! god doesn't spreak to you and tell you that, does he? (muhhaha, unless you had a vision...... but that would only happen if your evil or weird eh?) anyways please enjoy la toy and dont let assies bother any of you guys because you rule! (except for dissas and over religious ppls on this site...tete) - Kandimandi"
4,Fun,Lots of fun with a couple of friends to spook about yourselves. I do take ghost and spirits seriously and so we dont make fun or mess around but it does show who has the courage and who doesnt when you realize that your not the one moving the piece! Nicely constructed and well marked
3,Are you people SERIOUS!!!!,"I just HAVE to say that some of these reviews are utterly ridiclous! This IS a TOY, made by Paker Brothers NOT a Satanic Board Game!As I KNOW for a fact this 'game' works, but in NO way shape or form am I afriad of being, 'attacked' somehow by Demon's.IT'S SOLD at Toys 'R Us for ""G..'s"" SAKE!!!"
4,"everyone, calm down","this is a toy. not a satanic devise forged by the devil. yea, im a chrisitian, but like i said, its a TOY. it's a fun thing to play with. it messes with your mind. get a group of friends and play it. all you chrisitians, if it makes you feel better, say a prayer before you use it. but this is plastic and cardboard, its not going to hurt you. if you want to have fun with friends, buy this. dont be scared of getting possesed or anything stupid like that from a piece of plastic."
5,works good,i bought this cause both my inlaws past away and my husband wanted to talk to them well it worked. my husband got his answer to bad it only worked the one time now we are not getting anything
1,This toy is bad news,Ok first of all this is a tool used in Wicca and this is not a kids toy this is bad news for people i really suggest that you do not buy this kind of thing for a kid unless they really really really know what they are doing this is something that shouldnt be played with and shouldnt be used as a toy this really does contact spirits may they be good or bad. Using this makes you very open to the spirit relm and is like leaving your door open and then going on vacation BAD NEWS don not buy this sort of thing unless you know what you are doing. THIS DOES WORK and can make you posessed if u dont know what you are doing!
1,You need some tipe of protection with this.,"You mighte need some protection against the evil spirits that live in the board. I suggest using a pentagram... But use whatever you want for protection. And if ur using a pentagram, Its the 5 pointed star made from 1 line... And if the pentagram is upside down, it wont protect you!!! The upside down pentagram atracts evil spirits"
1,don't buy this,this is not a toy. i'm in the group to ban this ouija boards. it's a disgrace for it to be soo easily bought. i am a parents and if any parents think of buying this...please don't buy it. so help u God is with u
1,DANGER - YOU CAN BE POSSESSED,"This is not a toy. Several numerous accounts of possession, madness, and suicide are documented regarding this dangerous board. DO NOT get this board, DO NOT have it in your home, MOST ESPECIALLY DO NOT let your children play with it, it is highly dangerous!"
1,Mistaken purchase,"I did not read the text initially. Out of habit I just purchased what Amazon offered as options. I later learned that 'Region 2' was for European VCRs.I realize your have a world wide market, which we don't always take into consideration when purchasing on the internet.It seems it would be more cost effective to isolate country specific items."
4,Blame it on Rio DVD,"Blame it on Rio was just as good as I remembered it. A lighthearted comedy about friends who get caught up in ""forbidden"" romances. I enjoyed it. The DVD quality was pretty good too."
3,Sounds dubbed.,"This rating is for the disk and not the movie.I bought this and found I couldn't stand to watch it.This movie was filmed in stereo, but the DVD has monosound. Normally that wouldn't be a problem except theyscrewed up the levels.As a result the sound seems totally detached from thevideo, like when a movie is dubbed without attentionto action.I should have returned this, but waited too long, I soldit to a used book/video store."
5,"Warm, funny postcard from Rio de Janeiro","Gorgeous cinematography, great samba-tinged soundtrack, a hilarious script, and a wonderful cast make this a very enjoyable film. It remains as fresh, warm, and funny as it was when it was first released. Michael Caine's comic timing is, as always, dead on, Michelle Johnson conveys both innocence and teenage hormone-psychosis perfectly, and Joseph Bologna and Valerie Harper are the right combination of buffoonery and bitterness. I think the irreverence and intelligence of the film shows through in the smallest details: the advice of the umbanda woman, the uncommunicative maid, the camera-happy Japanese tourist, the very English Peter and Elaine, etc. With a less sensitive, less intelligent script, this could have been a tawdry tale of illicit love, but instead it is a delicately-crafted farce which perfectly captures the hedonism and sensuality of a cidade maravilhosa, Rio de Janeiro."
5,Blame it on Rio,"I love this movie. It's funny, and sexy, and witty. I received the movie quickly, in great shape, and at a great price. Thanks"
2,"Bad script, nice scenery","I can't believe we were watching the same movie here. Apart from the gorgeous body of Michelle Johnson and the scenic shots of Rio there is very little to like about this flick. Michelle's acting is bad, the script is sophomorish, the audio is amateurish, and subject matter borders on disgusting."
5,extremely funny,One of the funniest movies I remember. Michael Caine has a special talent when it comes to delivering a line. I especially enjoyed how he made his viewing audience a part of some scenes. This would be a great seller if the video were available for sale.
4,It's like La Cage Aux Folles,"I just saw this movie at a friend's house. Oh my God this is so funny albeit the moral issues. It's like The Birdcage- that old French school of hysterical comedies you can watch a million times. Caine's best friend was the best part of this movie. This guy really made me scream on the floor because he's like Robert Deniro's character in ""Meet The Parents"" on Benzedrine (""iF YOU DO ANYTHING TO CORRUPT MY PRECIOUS FIRST BORN DAUGHTER i WILL BRING YOU DOWN. I WILL BRING YOU DOWN TO CHINA TOWN!)And remember the look on that maid's face when she walked in on Caine and his friend in a suggestive position?!Although an old guy shagging with a young girl can make one hurl- it works in this film. You know- in a Froggie way.Good stuff!"
2,Why it's worth watching,"Come on guys lets be honest...Only reason to watch this is Michelle Johnson. She has an amazing body, and she's topless in several scenes. If Mindy Cohen (Facts of Life) played the part this video would have been out of print by 1988."
2,The DVD is too dark,I wrote a 4-star review of the VHS version of this movie on 11/22/00. Later I bought the DVD version. The DVD was much darker. Some of the night scenes were almost completely black. This was annoying and made the DVD useless to me. It made no sense to me why they did this. The VHS version is great!
4,Fun 80's Flick,"Matthew (Michael Caine) and Victor (Joseph Bologna) are two middle aged pals who take their teen daughters, Jenifer (Michelle Johnson) and Nicky (Demi Moore), on a vacation to Rio. Matthew's wife (Valerie Harper), apparently having doubts about their marriage, insists on vacationing by herself. Matthew ends up being seduced by Jenifer and the rest of film flows from there.This is actually a very well made movie for this type of screwball comedy, with excellent acting by Caine and some clever dialogue. The setting in Rio is extraordinarily colorful and sensual, with the whole city seemingly one non-stop party. It also harkens back to the ""anything goes"" spirit of the 70's-early 80's with it's sexually controversial subject matter. This is the type of movie that couldn't get made by a major studio nowadays because of political correctnes. It's a fun movie from a different era and one well worth watching."
4,Blame it on Rio,It is hillarious. We saw it years ago and it is as funny as we remembered. We just loved Michael Caine and Joseph Bolonga. Their walk on the beach was great.
4,MADE ME FEEL YOUNG AGAIN,"GREAT SCENERY. GREAT MUSIC. MADE ME WANT TO CATCH THE NEXT JET TO RIO AND SEE IF IT WAS FOR REAL. VERY FUNNY AND ENJOYABLE ACTING. MICHAEL CAINE IS SMOOTH AS ALWAYS ,AND HE MADE ME FEEL YOUNG AGAIN. ENJOY THE MUSIC AND FEEL THE BEAT OF BRAZIL."
3,hmmm..,"Three stars go toward the movie being really funny, but then its subject matter is a bit actually more than a bit disgusting!"
5,Absolutely maginficent!,"I found this recording to be one of Sondheim's best. It perfectly captures the magnificence of the score and the performers. Marin Mazzie's lush voice is perfect for the role of Clara and Donna Murphy is Fosca to a tee. The plot can be sluggish (this is more of a problem in the video, than on the CD, but the video is one of the best recordings of a musical that is commercially available and is well worth the money.) All in all, though, it is a pleasure to listen to and great for any musical lover."
3,"Beautiful, But Unmemorable Score","Stephen Sondheim's score for 1994's Tony-winning ""Passion"" is beautiful, but does not contain any standout songs destined to become classics.Donna Murphy has a wonderful voice and shines particularly on ""I Wish I Could Forget You"" and ""No One Has Ever Loved Me"".A nice addition for theatre lovers & must-have for Sondheim enthusiasts. Otherwise, checkout Mr. Sondheim's better works: ""Company"", ""Sweeney Todd"", ""Assassins"" or ""Follies""."
5,Beautiful - a 1st choice performance,"I cannot agree more with the sky reviewer - earlier. This performance of two Schubert's piano trios is truely sublime, musical and colorful. The sound is gorgeous and alive. This performance was also highly acclaimed by Gramophone as one of the best. Highly recommended. I absolutely love Schubert's Arpegionne Sonata. But, the best performance of this piece is Rostropovich/Britten's version on Decca's legendary performance. Just listen and you'll love it."
2,Spiritless technology,"Very disappointing. True, the technique is superb. Every sound is heard, in absolute accordance with the score. The recording is more than satisfactory. But the performance is spiritless, especially when Schiff is playing. Perenyi does make an effort to put some life into the music, but the cello alone is not enough to compensate for his coleagues."
2,batman joker,"this batman is not very well made. batmans cape is of poor quaility fabric. both charaters have only minimal articulation, head shoulder & hip. if you want the joker to complete the justice league collection this is the only way i know to get one.... sigh..."
2,Camisole,It's okay. It's a lot more skimpy than the descriptive picture indicates.I kept it because I needed it and wasn't willing to run from store to store to find a better constructed garment. Greatly overpriced.
2,Built up Camisole,"This camisole did not fit my purpose. The idea is great, but it didn't fit me correctly"
1,"Do not buy General Books LLC ""The World as Will and Idea""","This ""translation"" of The World as Will and Idea printed by General Books LLC is terrible.No translator is listed. It is incomplete, missing important parts, and was total waste of money.The disclaimer at the beginning of the book says in part:""...While the publisher and author have used their best efforts...they make no representation or warranties with respect to the accuracy or completeness of the contents of this book..."" Further down it says:""We have created this book from the original using Optical Character Recognition software to keep the cost of the book as low as possible. ...please forgive any spelling mistakes, missing or extraneous characters...""That pretty well sums it up. General Books LLC books clearly aren't even worth the money put into making them.If you want a usable copy look for more well-known publisher. This is unusable for anyone studying the text academically, and fairly worthless for anyone else."
1,Kindle edition,"The Kindle edition of this work is a disaster. There is no Table of Contents, much less a Contents with active links. Worse, the text itself is full of formatting problems and typos. We very much need a Kindle edition of Schopenhauer's main work (in particular, the two volumes translated as The World as Will and Representation). But this is NOT that edition."
3,Not as it seems,"Unfortunately this title is misleading and starts in the middle of the book. It is a fair price for what you get but this kind of heady reading is not something one wants to start in the middle. I was unable to find a ""part I"" to this series so instead purchased an abridgement of the entire work so I intend to read the abridged version until it catches up with this, more detailed part of the work.It comes from a source that allows you to download books very inexpensively but I didn't look into that as it is not for me. It may be a way to find the volume I of this series.G"
