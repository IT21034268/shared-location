3,Scoops,"Product mostly OK, but found that old method of scooping contents of melons, avocados, etc. is still easier and more efficient using good old thin-walled strong spoons. Delivery was prompt."
5,Love These!,I love these scoopers. I use them to scoop all sorts of things. The color coding is great and they really work on the melons.
2,Disappointed,"I read the other reviews and was very excited and looking forward to trying my new ""toys"". I tried the largest size for a canterlope and a small pitless watermelon with no success. It made the biggest mess. I wish I knew how other people were able to get the small circle to cover the entire half of the canterlope/watermelon. I am reluctent to try again. I think my old way was better without the tools."
5,Very useful kitchen tools,"I love these fruit scrappers. I use the smallest one to scrape the mango out of the skin, after I use the mango cutter. The large scrapper is excellent for cantaloupe. You can use the fruit scrappers for making twice baked potatoes or potatoe skins, the small one works great for that."
1,I don't get it?,"I tried these ""scoops"" on watermelon and cantelope to no avail. The term ""scoops"" indicates you can actually scoop something out. Not so. Yes, it would cut through the melons but you cannot ""scoop"" it out as the fruit just falls through the hole. Very disappointing and I should have known better. Would not recommend for anything. They are colorful."
4,Works like a charm,"I just ordered these because I was looking for an easy way to cut up melons which I love to eat, but hate to prepare. I haven't used them on the melons yet, but this morning when my daughter and I were cleaning out our pumpkins for Halloween, they worked so well that my daughter asked me ""where have these been all my life?"". If they can handle pumpkins, they can handle melons. Now I can't wait to use them again."
5,I love these scoops!,"I have found these to be very handy. I've used them for kiwi, mangoes, even for making potato skins (I use the red one to scoop out some of the potato from its skin, leaving a nice shell to fill with cheese, etc). Because of their shapes, they are better than using a spoon to scoop stuff out. It takes a little finesse to use them, but I have found that they make certain prep jobs easier, safer (I don't need to use a knife in some cases), and less messy."
3,Just iffy,"These items are made of plastic and although they work to some extent, they tend to bend easily so it's a mixed bag."
2,Interesting ideas poorly written,"Norman Klein is a professor and he writes like one! Meaning he doesn't seem to want to express his ideas simply because that would not be learned. This is ironic when he bemoans the powerful using ""speacial effects"" to deceive the huddled masses, that he couldn't write more clearly."
5,awasome,"hi !this one really works, great thing to use to extend your WIFI range. great bargain for the money.hey it works for me. and i love it."
3,Wish it worked better,The only way I get this to work is by standing on it!!! but the result is great
3,"Low quality, sometimes gets job done","I purchased this item to create something DIY for my wedding this September. Ot of the box, my sister tried to use it on plain office paper but was unsuccessful...the bits of paper became lodged in the punch and some effort was required to free up the punch.It will work with ample, even pressure, but there is still a tendency for it to become clogged. It does not work well with thicker papers but I will punch it through aluminum foil a couple times to see if it will sharpen it up."
2,Age makes a difference,"Although the 2 batteries were of the proper design to fit my phone, they were manufactured in 2004. That's 8 years sitting on the shelf. Because of this, one of the two batteries that I got died after 1 month of use, the other is still working but has a very low capacity and will have to be replaced soon. Not a very good deal!"
4,a different way to read Paul,"This book is a good one for Sunday Schools. It is grouped into ""themes"", can be divided into individual sections for study. A little history and sociology puts these important letters into perspective, while keeping them relevant for today."
2,Cheap and Slightly defective,"I have had this for over a year now. I bought this to stash away in the closet as part of an emergency kit. Overall it works ok. The reception is a little questionable. The look and feel are sturdy but kind of cheap. My big complaint is that the volume dial which turns the radio on and dials up the volume the farther you go... does not work on mine. If you turn it on the volume is full blast no matter how much you turn the dial. The dynamo works good, that and the price are what made buy this radio. But looking back on it now i am willing to spend some money for something i expect to depend on in a bad situation where power might be out and i want to know whats going on.So all in all i can't really recommend this radio to anyone. I don't believe it will stand up to regular use. And i don't trust it for an emergency radio as it is defective."
4,Be ready to get fit,I just got this DVD a week ago and it will be a challenge if you are like me and have not worked out consistently for about 6 months.
3,"7 is bad, Cantamos is great","Seven has about two decent songs on it, and I am a serious Poco fan. Worth the price for the excellent Cantamos alone. The problem with Seven is the uncharacteristically disjointed harder rock sounding songs that Schmidt and Cotton wrote. Just not the right sound for this band. I realize they were on the rebound from Richy Furay leaving, so they hadn't yet found a direction maybe. Rusty Young seems to have started to contribute more on Cantamos and it has the consistent acoustic sound they perfected in that era."
5,Seven/Cantamos,I bought this for my husband as a present. I have come to enjoy this as much as my husband also.
5,Nice long read for a rainy day,"This book is a great adventure tale for all ages. I really enjoyed the story and the art is simply beautiful. If reading short duck stories leaves you crying ""more!,"" then this is the book for you."
4,A Door Opens... And Closes!,"This is a long adventure serial starring Huey, Dewey & Louie, Donald Duck and Uncle Scrooge. The ducks are transported to an alternate reality, where they help human beings battle against alien barbarians. It is well written, with great artwork. This is very different from other Disney comic books, but it's a lot of fun."
5,Excellent album,"A word of advice, pick up the two CD compilation ""30 Massive Rock Tracks"" and also pick up ""The Best of Gillan"" which is out of print but you can still buy used from Amazon, you will get 46 differant songs for a low price that pretty much covers Ian's solo career from 1976 to 1991 you won't be disapointed."
2,failed...,after about 2 years of ownership now BOTH 30V outputs have failed. First one a few months ago - now the second one. Disappointing.
5,Turn towards Hope,"We're riding the crest of a wave, here, back to something human.This country's 20-year-long, wild, combative ""Free-Market"" ride off the Extreme Right end of the scale is brought into question as Ms. Zoglin dares to utter the dismissed term ""Collective"" again.But she's not talking about Politics! There is no discussion of Democrats vs Republican, Conservative or Liberal. She is using her extensive credentials in community development to blueprint a simple, grass roots plan that promises to harness the boiling megatons of energy in today's disenfranchised youth. Her world focus is from the bottom up, working one-on-one, using old fashioned concepts of humility, respect and love to inspire us. She embraces the existing system and offers a real, workable plan that relies on nothing more than a bit of ""trickle down"" from the Have's. Fund us, she challenges, and we can work miracles... for ourselves, the country and the World.This is a brilliant, postive work."
3,Danger: Will not hold a charge!,"I have had my Solio for 6 months. While it has performed adequately, it WILL NOT HOLD A CHARGE for the 6 months suggested on the Solio website. I, at best, get it to hold a charge for 7 days. So, don't count on this as a backup powersource when holding a charge is important. Also, the Solio folks are not very helpful when contacted."
5,Biography and history,"This book is an expansive overview of the life of Louise Brooks and also of the early days of the movie industry. Very throughly researched, it gives a nuanced look and the beautiful, brilliant and maddeningly self-destructive icon. It also is a wonderful history of the entertainment world in the 1920's and the personalities who populated that world. A must-read from fans of Louise Brooks."
5,Understanding Louise Brooks,"Superb biography of a simply fascinating personality. Here was a women who literally and figuratively had everything: stunning beauty; talent; training; desire; intelligence; in the right place at the right time, and knew the right people, to achieve both stage and screen immortality and who, multiple times--not just once -- multiple times, snatched defeat from the jaws of victory. What a story!"
5,Read well before purchase,"The books are great, but do not be in such a hurry that you so not realize that there are THREE authors McCaffery (Crystal Line), Weis (Short Stories) and Bradley (Witchlight), if you already have some of these as I did you will feel that Amazon should list the books."
3,"pretty good, on second thought","Early on, the batteries seemed to struggle to maintain a charge or to deliver power to the three ""main"" tools. Over the past two months, however, I've been pleased with the set. Using the reciprocrator, I was able to fully modify a steel bike frame and cut down a large bush on one charge. I've used the drill on a variety of jobs, mainly installing deadbolts and mortise locks on several doors, as well as many smaller jobs with no problems. The circle-saw is pretty good as well, and has successfully cut through 2x4s without trouble.I can't explain the early problems, but they seem to have disappeared completely."
3,some gray requires 2nd treatment,"This product is advertised to work ""only on the gray"" and that just isn't true. I have a goatee and on the right and left ends of it, I have patches of very color resistant gray. If I would leave the product on long enough to get those patches to color, the rest of my goatee would be midnight black. I normally have to color my entire goatee and then do a 2nd process just involving those 2 resistant patches (and I normally leave the product on 2 minutes more than the directions state for the 2nd process). But after it's all done, the end result is a nice ash brown goatee, free of the gray that ages me 10 years. If it could happen in one treatment, I'd change my rating to 5 stars. Growing old sure sucks."
3,good to lose that Santa look after Christmas,"Got tired of the Santa look, so the Ash brown can work, but I think I rather have the Med Brown"
2,Color Match With Hair Color Disappointing,Mustache color does not match the same color I use on my hair. It has more of a black shade to it.
3,Field Guides need illustrations for ALL the animals/plants!,"I bought two of the books in the 3 book series. The writing is excellent, however, what good is a ""field guide"" if illustrations are not included for all of the featured plants and animals? If the publisher is ever going to consider a new edition, perhaps this could be taken into consideration. I will keep these books, however still look for a ""Field Guide"" that offers more reference material."
5,Regency Delight,Judith Lansdowne has done it again. The Mystery Kiss has unique but loveable characters and a plot that keeps one enthralled. The book is a delight. It is even better than the Nightingale series-- though I know few will believe that to be possible.
4,Great Info on Natural Hair Care,"I enjoyed reading this book and I refer to it quite often. Still a relative newbie to natural hair care, I particularly appreciate the way Diane has interwoven lists of hair care products that have proven success on natural hair with stories of her celebrity clients' hair care issues. There are also some wonderful photographs in the book.I'd highly recommend this book as a must read for anyone who is pondering going natural, as I was at the time of reading the book initially."
3,textured tress,This book is a good book for stylist that do all types of hair not just naturals. This book also has a styles and commercial products.
2,Not a good source,I was not happy with the way the book read. It seems to me she was mostly talking about her clients. I found that some of the information was useful to me but it wasn't worth the time to read it.
2,"Book would be okay if it took ""Ultimate"" out of the title","If you're newly nappy, this book is probably for you. It gives some general information on hair textures and has some interesting styles. ""Ultimate"" it ain't. The author apparently isn't aware that there are several excellent natural hair care texts that cover this ground more thoroughly than she does. She even claims to have invented the twist out. Now for all I know she may be right, but there is at least one book out there (Pamela Ferrell's Let's Talk Hair) that already addresses this style by that name, and another (Lonnice Brittenum Bonner's books) that use another name but is essentially the same style). If you've been nappy for a number of years and are looking for an ""ultimate"" style book, give this book a pass. If you're newly nappy, buy Pamela Ferrell's Let's Talk Hair, and take this book out of the library for some additional styles."
2,Not for do it yourself naturals,"I thought this book was a waste of money for the fact that it doesn't really teach you how to maintain anything. There are some minor things in there about self care, but mostly she is saying to see a stylist and buy these products. Yes major advertising in here. There is information on braids, and even relaxers(def not natural) I don't know I thought the title was very misleading."
1,Not A Good Book For Natural Hair Care,"This is not a book for Naturl Hair Care, esspecially if you are thinking about going natural or transtioning. This book is all about a but of pictures of celibirites and name dropping. In the beginning I thought it was going to be great and have pictures of different natural hair styles I could choose from. NOT!!! She talks about its ok to use chemicals in your hair if your go to a professional, and just all of this other stuff that has nothing to do with Natural hair care or for a sista thinking about going natural and is looking for some real information on how to care for her hair. I was totally disappointed that I sent this book back and got my money back. If your're looking for a book with a bunch of celebrites in it then this is for you, but you want to go Natural and you need some great information on how to care for your hair this is not the book for you."
4,"pretty good, offers step by step techniques","offers alot of techniques, but didn't have anything that was too different. good for basic styling tips"
3,OKAY for starters,"I ve read other hair care books ,and this wasnt the best as far as informative help-Care tips .Da Costa focus on how to style hair and not on how to keep it healthy.For those who need helpful tips on how to take care of natural hair I would suggest Lets talk hair or No Lye.Both are more informative and less ""advertised""."
2,Not Quite for the Natural-Haired Woman,"This book really confuses me. Instead of calling it the ""Ultimate Guide to Maintaining and Styling NATURAL hair"", it should be appropriately titled ""The collective guide of photos with models wearing weaves or chemically altered hair"". I pretty much just use it for decoration on my coffee table, because there isn't too much information in it for someone like myself - an ALL NATURAL, chemical free woman with a huge afro."
3,"Good Reference, but not a DIY Guide","I found Diane DaCosta's book long on photos and celebrity gossip, but short on practical advice for the sistah (or brother) who wants to do her own hair. While DaCosta offers step by step instructions for a handful of styles, I expected more. I was also annoyed by the weird layout of text, which made it hard to match photos with their descriptions. If she ever does a second edition, I hope it will include bigger captions. This book would really have benefited from more color photos and more detailed advice for people who are making the transition from relaxed to natural hair. The photos of men's styles are a nice touch. To truly get your money's worth, share a copy with a friend. Better yet, just check it out from the library."
1,Nothing new...,"I also was really excited when I heard this book was coming out, but became quickly disappointed. I was hoping Ms. DaCosta would offer added information to the care and styling of natural African hair. There isn't anything that has been displayed better than Pamela Farrell's Let's Talk Hair or Tulani Kinard's NO LYE in this book. Unfortunately I saw nothing new."
4,Nice mid size wood block,I have about 4 wood blocks and 1 bamboo. This is a well finished product. Will need seasoning which I suggest you commence with as soon as you get it. Continue daily for 2 weeks until the board is saturated. I use the mineral oil and Boos wood cream in combination. This should handle most cutting jobs. Its not as heavy as some but no lightweight nor was it meant to be. The cut of the end-grain wood is nice and smooth. Would have given this 5 stars if it had handle indentations or feet to lift it off the countertop. As far as quality I like this board and it will likely go into the top of my rotation when preparing larger meals. Be careful not to slam this board down when maneuvering it as this will eventually cause the board to split and peel apart no matter how well oiled the wood is. So be gentle and you will be fine.
5,JK Adams 16-inch square maple wood end-grain cherry chunk cutting board,"We oiled it about 10 times with mineral oil (from Target) before the first use. It works great! We bought little feet for the bottom. Wipe it off after every use, but don't immerse in water. Store it on end. It is heavy, but is a great size. Seems obvious, but measure the space where you want to use it and store it. Love cutting on this board!"
5,"The best peeler, period.","I came across this peeler while volunteering to cook a meal at the Ronald McDonald House. I knew right away it was no ordinary peeler. By the time I finished the salad I knew I had to have it! I went home, found it online, and peeling has never been the same. Whenever someone uses it they comment on the fact that it is a remarkable kitchen item. Thanks Mario.The only draw back is inevitable texture of the serrations. What can you do."
2,Not what I ordered.,"I was not pleased when I received this knife because it is not the one pictured. I wanted burgundy and silver, my knife was gold and brown. Do not trust this seller's pictures. I kept the knife because I needed one and didn't have time to exchange, but acually it is not what I ordered."
4,Satisfactory CD Player,"This CD player is pretty good, but not the best. First with the negatives, is guzzles up batteries SO fast that I bought a recharging kit for them. Its also not that easy to navigate around a 200 song MP3 CD. With multiple headphones, I started only getting sound out of only my left ear. The sound quality is satisfactory. The car kit is nice as well. It is pretty durable, I dropped it around 15 times from pretty high while working out until I started encountering problems. It stopped playing MP3 cds, and then one day it randomly stopped playing all CDs. It had a lifespan of around 10 months for regular CDs, and 8 for MP3 CDs. But it still might be working if I didn't drop it a lot. It was a good CD player but I will be buying another one this time, that is a little more expensive. Overall, it is a satisfactory CD player."
5,Approachable and Engaging,"I've read more academic books (and think those are important, too. For that, I recommend ""Demystifying Borderline Personality Disorder""), but this one was accessible and engaging, and had useful and practical advice for people with the illness and those around them. Because of that, the book gives the reader a sense of hope. In this field, that can be rare. There is some sexual content, and I can understand why some people would find that offensive. I personally didn't. Any misgivings I have about the book are offset by my enthusiasm about its readability and its usefulness to the people for whom it is written: borderlines and their families."
1,Caution,"Beware: A full HALF of this book is written like a novel... and a cheesy, awful one at that.Borderline Personality Disorder Demystified (Friedman et al) was far more informative and respectful. And Borderline Personality Disorder for Dummies, despite its unfortunate title, was also excellent; very complete and easy to read."
4,A easy to understand book on BPD,"A comprehensive book with medical bullet points and real life stories from people who suffer from this illness. It is extremely easy to read and you won't feel overwhelmed by medical jargons, but instead feel you have having a person-to-person conversation."
3,my thoughts in brief,"I've done plenty of DPB reading, and this is useful in some ways. It is pretty comprehensive. This book tries to offer information to soothe the borderline and those in contact with him/her. As a borderline, I felt even guiltier than usual reading about the negative effects of my illness on my loved ones, which was unnesessary. Not good. On the other hand, it is one of the few BPD books I've found on the subject that briefly outlines other, often concurrent, illnesses, which was helpful. If you're a dedicated student of the illness and feel the need to read everything available on the topic, read the whole thing. If you've done your research already, you'll find it somewhat redundant. If you're new to it, you can get everything you need without the clinically technical chapters."
2,Not helpful for the BPD patient,"As a person with what I would consider ""moderate"" BPD, this book is not very good for the BPD sufferer. The stories in this book are very cliche and in my opinion do not capture the essence of living with someone who is BPD. In ways it is harder living with me than the examples in the book. In other ways though I am not nearly so silly as some of the examples given. When I bought the book I had thought that the authors had a diagnoses of BPD. When I found out though they they were simply experts on the subject I was taken aback. As I began to read I noticed that this book did not seem to understand the reality of a BPD diagnosis, it seemed very clinical. I found the book ""The Borderline and the Buddha"" the best book on BPD that I have read and I would highly recommend it. As a plus it is written by a actual BPD patient!"
4,this one's better than Hate You,I liked this book better than I Hate You--Don't Leave Me because it offers more case studies. The authors don't get on a soapbox about the negative aspects of modern life that may bring about more folks dealing with BPD.
3,"Fair picture, difficult to use menu",Fair picture quality. Difficult to use menus.Wait for price to drop as market matures.
1,"plenty of problems, little to look at","I can't comment on the picture quality, after two days of trying the frame still would not accept any images. It's USB port was not recognized by any of our computers at home (Mac or PC), which seems to be a common problem. The manual (and website) states the obvious and was not verry helpful. Returned it as soon as possible."
1,Same issues as others...can't read card,"I bought this at an outside store and inserted an XD card and it told me it had no media. I'm a ""techie"" so I know what I'm doing. Back to the store it goes."
5,GrandParents got one!,Got one for Christmas. Love it! Put it in the kitchen and when we go in there we are greeted by so many wonderful photos!!!!A GREAT gift for grand parents!
2,"Looks good, doesn't play pic from computer","The product would be great if it played jpg's stored/copied from a computer. It will only play pictures taken from a camera on that card. Once the pictures are uploaded to a computer and downloaded to a card in the same format-jpg, it will not recognize the file. Westinghouse reps admitted to this flaw, but did nothing to replace/upgrade my viewer"
1,Piece Of Crap!,"We were missing the charging cable to the frame. So, I put batteries in it, and it will only display 3 picture and then the thing shuts off! I put brand new batteries in it, and the same thing happened! I bought this as a gift for my mom, and she hasn't even been able to use it. Worst money I have ever wasted!!!"
2,Cute style but the fabric is too rough,"This is a cute style to use as a ""hang-around-the-house-and-garden"" dress, but unfortunately the fabric is much to rough and coarse for my tastes, despite washing it repeatedly. It feels heavy and unpleasant, not soft like denim I'm accustome to wearing."
2,Sizing isn't accurate,"I purchased this, following the sizing chart. The 1-X is way, way too large. I'll be sending it back for a smaller size. I'm planning on using this as a smock."
4,"Good quality, good value",The dress arrived quickly. The quality is nice at an affordable price. I have ordered several more dresses for my mother.
1,Disappointed,"I love the LIVE Radio City Music Hall Christmas Spectacular but was very disppointed in this DVD because they continuously show the people in the audience! I did not buy this DVD to look at a bunch of strangers in the audience!!! I don't know why film makers do this when filming a show or concert. I regret purchasing this and if I had known they were going to be cutting into the show to show the audience, I never would have purchased it. If they did NOT show the audience, I would have given it 5 stars. If you don't mind looking at a bunch of strangers making stupid ""oooo"" and ""ahhhh"" faces, then buy the DVD!"
2,Stay Away! It's Widescreen Format In A 4 X 3 Aspect Ratio,"How dissapointed I was when I popped in this disc on my high def TV and found this show to be matted in widescreen on a 4 X 3 aspect ratio. Like some of the other reviews here, this is inexcusable TIME-LIFE! What the hell are you doing? If this show was shot in high definition widescreen, it should be that way on the DVD. Why not just release it on Blu-ray next year, the correct way? That's the way this really needs to be seen. Stay away from this unless you plan to watch it on a 4 X 3 analog television. Dissapointed! Dissapointed! GET WITH IT TIME-LIFE!"
1,dissapointing quality of Rockettes Christmas show,"The basic sound and photo quality of this DVD of Amazons 'Radio city Christmas spectacular starring the Rockettes""was of incredibly amateurish quality. tinny sound, dark underexposed pictures.Dull listless performances. Only little children in audience seemed to enjoy this show.there is nothing in the show that is exciting,performers seemed bored.Only interesting actors were two boys, brothers -older one is cynical and thinks Santa is just an old phony--while his younger brother is entranced by the magic of the holiday and believes Santa is real-needless to say that by end of the show the older boy becomes a true believer in the magic of Christmas and give the -M.C-Singing-., Santa, a great big hug.I would give him a hug for finally ending this lifeless show.."
3,"Great Performers,Terrible Director","I would have loved to see this great production but an egotisical director who wanted to make himself the star ruined 'total' enjoyment..If you have seen the filmed productions of 'Cats' or 'Into The Woods',you probably noticed thatthe camera focused on the production...and we got to see the entire performances...However, Ego brain never allowed the camera to focus on a dance routine or a singer for longer than five seconds without switching focus..He would pull the camera away so we saw more of the theater than the show..I know no one who goes to the theater to watch the 'audience'...but Captain Ego showed as much of the audience as he did the show...The 'show' deserved SEVEN stars..the filming deserved a TWO....What a waste!"
2,"Low Resolution, Old format.","Buyer beware, this DVD is a low resolution, standard 4:3 format DVD. It is much different from the one broadcasted in PBS television, which was in widescreen 16:9 with full 1080p HD resolution. I am very disappointed with this poor quality DVD. My advice is that, don't buy this one and waste your money."
5,Radio City Christmas Spectacular,"This has to be the most entertaining DVD in years,it is 80 minutes of sheer pleasure.I recomend it most highly."
4,Radio City Christmas Show 2008,"Having gone to this show in 2007 as a New Zealand visitor it bought all the happy memories. In fact, it was the only stage show I saw in New York due to the stagehands strike in 2007.The picture and sound quality was fabulous, and I have be able to relive the joy and glamour as well as the Christmas symbolism. Great DVD and I'll treasure it."
4,My 89 year-old father loves it!,"I watched this with my dad after i got it for hm for Christmas -- It's O.K. in my opinion, but he loves it! I'm giving it 4 Stars for him. At 89 he doesn't have much patience for most movies and often can't follow the plot, so this is ideal entertainment for him. He lives in a senior apartment complex where they have some organized entertainment and some more spontaneous events. He loaned this to the entertainment coordinator and the folks who saw it raved about it so much they had to do a 2nd showing for the ones who missed it -- no charge, of course."
5,Dazzling,Saw them live last year Dec 2007 and it was really special. My very favorite is the wooden soldiers march...dazzling choreography. Nice that they're coming out with a DVD. Hope that the DVD will do justice to the show.
1,Bad Editing made this unwatchable for me,"I tried to watch this but could not. I thought I'd enjoy this as I enjoy Christmas shows(free with Prime,so wanted to try something new). However, each shot lasts about 1 second, so I never get a true view of what the dancers are doing, there is no continuity, and eventually I started to get a headache. I had to quit watching within the first few minutes. I don't know much about TV production but would like to see this show edited differently."
2,Terrible transfer of a spectacular event,"What a shame this wonderful event had to be mastered so poorly. It was filmed for high def, but the transfer is 4x3 matted! They could have easily done anamorphic. It's also a single layer DVD. Avoid this unless you're a big fan!"
2,DVD not enhanced for Widescreen TVs,"Watched this program on PBS [which is broadcast in HD]--but was stunned to find that this stand alone DVD is a non-anamorphic release, which means it is hard letterboxed. BOOOO! I hope a Blu-Ray release will do this program justice."
5,VISUALLY PERFECT!,"The picture quality of this DVD is amazing! It's filmed in HD, so it looks almost 3-D during the tour bus skit. I've read the reviews by the people who rated this production only 1 or 2 stars for poor visual quality. What are they talking about?? This DVD is truly amazing, and I've seen the show live. There are only a few shots of the audience, and this makes me feel like I'm sitting there, too.Also, I watch about 5 DVDs a day in my line of work, and this DVD fills up my big screen TV almost entirely, with just a small bar on the top and the bottom of the TV. The format ratio does not disrupt my viewing pleasure at all.If you're a fan of the Radio City Music Hall Spectacular, please don't hesitate to buy this fine DVD!"
5,Great Christmas DVD,"This is a great Christmas DVD. I have never had the pleasure of being in NY for Christmas, but this DVD really makes you feel that your are there. The Radio City Christmas show is wonderful, and the quality of the DVD is superior. If you want a DVD that really get's you in the Christmas spirit, this is it. I also received the DVD very quickly upon purchasing it."
5,Down Memory Lane,"I attended the Radio City Christmas Spectacular this year with a friend and was very happy to be able to share the experience (somewhat) with my sisters for Christmas. It was a family tradition as we were growing up, to go to the show at Christmas time. After viewing the dvd and realizing that it is the exact show I saw, I was even more pleased that I had purchased it for them. They were on sale at Radio City for a lot more money, by the way. Well done!"
2,radio city,"i was a little disapointed because i thought i ordered the wide screen version however, it was not."
1,the requirements have changed,"I remember the Rockettes had to be identical in appearence, height, weight, etc. That was the tradition. Now they broke every rule. It's very disappointing."
3,"great show always when you are there, disapointing video","My wife and I live in NYC and have seen this show a number of times and it is always great, we ordered acopy for my mother in law in California , and got one for ourselves the show featured in this video is the 75th anniversy show which we attended. and we loved all the new stuff that was added and who does not love the rockettes. if you have never seen the show at Radio City Music Hall, get this video the touring show is good , but no where near as good as at the music Hallthe director of this video should have kept the cameras directed at the stage, stop with the difeerent angles and the audience faces this should have been recorded from a center Orchestra seat view point and the shots of the faces of the rockettes were dumb . they are a precision dance team show the complete routine from the audience view point not from the side or back"
2,A COUPLE GLIMMERS OF HOPE AMID A POORLY PRODUCED MESS,"Let's face it. Genesis didn't really become Genesis until ""Trespass"" came along. Most of the lyrics here are very amateurish and the production is attrocious at best. What makes it worth a casual listen is Peter Gabriel's voice. He hadn't quite perfected his trademark rasp yet and it's interesting to hear him sing at the age of 18 in a voice that is more sweet and clear than what we all know and love him for.Amid the the mess are two songs that I actually like. ""In The Begining"" and ""The Conqueror"", but even these fall very short of what was to come over the next seven years or so. I would strongly recomend spending the money on the Volume One Archive box set. You'll get more than enough of this material as well as the classic line up of Gabriel, Collins, Rutherford, Hackett and Banks which fell into place in 71."
3,From the Phil Collins Band Back To Genesis,"In my opinion, begining with Abacab all we heard was the Phil Collins band, the mere pop frenzy, money hungry tunes that sweptthirteen year old girls and boys into some boringly romantic dream of bliss. With ""From Genesis to Revelation"" however, we return to virgin Genesis. Although the orchestration takes away from the genesis sound this CD shows use the true Genesis style with songs remenicent of their works on ""Lamb Lies Down on Broadway."" For me this deserve a place in my Genesis collection where those CD from Abacab on are fit for the heap!"
2,Didn't do much for wheatgrass,"Admittedly we've only used this once, but it really didn't do much at all. We ran two of the 4x4"" flats of wheatgrass through it and got less than an ounce of juice and a lot of mess.Probably should give it another go some day, but for now it just gathers dust."
4,"Pretty good, even if it's kind of annoying.","Like: Suction cup mount, good juice squeezing ability, fast, reasonably priced.Don't Like: Get a dish or bowl and put it under that hairball of wheatgrass coming out so you don't end up cleaning juice off the counter. Make sure you rinse off every bit of grass before putting in the dishwasher, lest it be baked on forever. Prepare to take a few times to get the hang of it, just kind of awkward all around."
5,love it,awesome juicer for the price. easy to assemble and use! easy to clean. i am pleased with this. buy it!!!!
3,is it juice yet?,"This little juicer is ok for the price. I am not really using it much. It is easy to clean, this is true, but it is hard to find a spot to clamp it to. it is hard to crank, At first you are ok, but believe me by the end your arm is getting tired and you are geeling like any more of this my one arm is going to be built, and my other arm is going to be winpy! i think neext time i just want an electric, but at 4 or 5 hundred? I will just have to use little trusty here."
3,GREAT FOR LEAFY VEGGIES,"I am a avid juicer, i love my breville but it doesn't really extract much juice from leafy vegetables. I read the reviews for this wheatgrass juicer and was a little hesitant to purchase. I have to say i am pleasantly surprised, i did not realize that i could extract that much juice from spinach. It is handy, it works but it is not perfect. I would not recommend it for long term use though, i am saving for a triturator so this will do for now. I am using it in conjunction with my juicer."
2,"works good, but breaks easy","been using this one for a couple years on wheatgrass only. Handle just cracked from cranking too hard. I'm going to look for metal version. Otherwise, works petty good and grass is not heated too much, thereby keeping the valuable enzimes in tact, unlike electric machines."
1,Design Flaw,"Actually, it seems constructed very well with sturdy material. I returned it, however. It had a design flaw in that when you are juicing, it is very hard to keep the juice from pouring out onto the table. The ""catch"" container wraps around the base of the unit. The juice pours (is supposed to) into the smallest edge of the container. If it moves even a quarter of an inch, you lose a lot of your juice. Where was their mind?? As it turns out, I lost in that I paid shipping coming AND going, AND they charged me a hugh restocking fee. :(("
3,nice product for the price,"Works pretty well for a manuel juicer. It's actually more efficient to hold steady with your hand rather than securing it to the countertop. It's a little difficult to keep the cup in place, because the crank occassionally hits it. Also, it's not the fastest juicer...but it gets the job done. It's easy to assemble and even easier to clean. Overall I like this product. Most of the electric wheatgrass juicers were over $150 dollars, and those were the cheap ones. Personally I think the price makes it worth the couple extra minutes it takes to use it."
1,Weak materials,"The materials used bend and soften with regular use. The first time I used it, it had warped where the crank handle meets the auger-- the second time I used it, it broke completely. The overall design is good, but a harder material is needed if you plan on using wheatgrass..."
2,Too messy & horrible design,Lots of things that I was disappointed in. MESSY MESSY MESSY! The area where the juice actually comes out is literally right next to the manual turn handle. The reservoir moves at the slightest bump and green juice goes everywhere. Poor design if you ask me. My counter tops aren't smooth so the suction-lock function is useless. The clamp that is suppose to secure it to a countertop didn't open as wide as the sides of my counters so there was the whole issue of 'where in the heck am I going to do this messy job??' It's the biggest pain and I wish it hadn't been because I was looking forward to an ounce or two of this miracle serum daily :( Discouraged. Selling it on Craigslist.
3,Not so sure yet,I got this on Saturday and have used it daily. I am finding that when I juice I turn the handle clockwise a few times but nothing comes out until I turn it counter clockwise. Then it starts flowing. Is this how its supposed to work?How many bunches of wheatgrass typically makes one shot? I find I am using 3 - 3 1/2 bunches.
3,Tricky juice spout.,"This machine really chews up the greens, but the juice spout is in a really tricky spot and leakage can be profound. The juicer is really easy to use and easy to clean. However, I wouldn't purchase the product again because my juice is too precious to allow it to leak all over the counter."
2,Wish I had not bought this,"This product worked great the first time I used it to juice wheatgrass. The second time, the juice just sat in the tube and I had to flush the juice out with more water than usual. The third time, nothing came out. Now it is just stored under the counter and considering the price, it is not worth it to pay to ship it back."
3,As described.,The product is well made and I had no trouble assembling the unit.My negative response is solely based on ethe amount of labor involved in getting a useful amount of juice. Too much time to get too little juice.Well packed for shipment and prompt shipment.Paul in Texas
1,Juicer worked poorly,It leaked more on the floor than it put juice inthe cup. I guess it was just a lemon due to others rate it highly I was not so lucky. Jim
5,Great little juicer,"This juicer is exactly what I was looking for, it works great and is easy to clean. The unit is very easy to put together and take apart. Very few pieces to keep track of. I'm using the juicer for wheatgrass and could not be happier. Truly a great buy."
4,It works great and is easy to clean,"I like the wheat greass juicer it works well, its easy to put together, easy to wash. My only complaint is the metal piece that holds the juicer to the counter does not fit our standard tile counter so I have to hold it in place which is annoying and then I have to tilt the juicer back so the juice falls into the cup. It would also be more convenient if the juice tray somehow attached to the base."
2,Juicer was not suitable for juicing large quantities,"Juicer was packaged well, and shipped on schedule. For the type of use that I need, I need to have more advanced model."
1,Very Difficult and Unpleasant To Use!,"I bought it because the price was right, but this juicer is definitely wrong. I lack the upper-body strength of a weight-lifter (which is required to turn the crank) and the patience it takes to produce any juice at all. It makes a terrible mess and is annoying to assemble and disassemble. I WANT A REFUND (AND SOME BAND-AIDS, PLEASE)!"
3,Juicer works fine,"The juicer worked fine the last time I tried it. It's way too soon to know how durable it is. It does not work on hard small seeds like flax seeds. I have not tried sesame seeds, but I think the results will be the same.I made peanut butter. It's chunky, like what you can get from the store; more chunky than I want. I want smo-o-o-th.Maybe I will try a mixture of walnuts, cashews, and peanuts, but I doubt the result will be smooth."
4,good for wheatgrass,"I decided to give wheatgrass growing a shot,first to save money and second because I thought it would be fun.I didn't want to sink alot of money into somthing I might not stick to.I think this little juicer works really well on wheatgrass and other greens.I've pressed carrots and apples in it but that's more time consuming.It's cheap and very easy to clean.If I continue my little wheatgrass farm,I may buy a metal manual juicer and save the plastic one for when I travel.My main concern with this juicer is the strengh of the handle under stress .Time will tell."
2,Didn't work for wheatgrass.,I tried several times to get it to juice wheatgrass and only a small amount came out. I was very disappointed. I ended up sending it back.
2,Melamine and BPA Polycarbonate Auger,"I was ready to buy this juicer for my leafy greens, but then i found out from Lexen the Auger is made of Melamine and Polycarbonate with BPA. I chose this model over the Z Manual because it has Melamine. Lexen is planning to have a newer BPA & Melamine free model in next year. So, I will wait or go with the All Stainless Steel model. Their website ONLY says polycarbonate, which is misleading if you ask me"
5,the best,"i love it not because it was affordable but because of the end result...love it, love it, love it..."
3,Healthy Juicer,"Great product, but my broke after 3 months of regular use. wheat grass pulp came out very dry. Company will send out a new part withen 12 months but you have to cover the $10.00 for shipping."
2,Not for me,"This product shipped quickly, and I had read great reviews about it, but it did not work for me. The juicer leaked a lot out of the bottom and came apart easily when I juiced, even coming off of the counter all together a few times (not a fun mess!). Some of the pieces did not come off with the tools provided and it took a lot of effort to dismantle it. After I took it apart and washed it, the pieces would not go back together, though three people tried to put it together. I returned it because it wasn't working as I expected it to after reading positive reviews. It extracted a lot of juice, though, and might be good for occasional juicing or as a temporary/back-up juicer."
5,Great product!,I love this product. Thinking of getting the electric one next. Does a great job on wheatgrass and leaf verges.
5,Maximum juicer,I love the Healthy Juicer. I believe this juicer extracts every bit of juice from my wheat grass with little or no waste. Easy to clean....great product.
4,worth the money.,this product is worthe the money. it is a bit tough to work and i feel it could be easier to get the juice out but once you get the hang of it you are good to go. It is also priced well considring some of the juicers are over a 100 bucks.
4,Works well,"For the price this is an excellent juicer.I did notice others say that the plastic can break though it seems well built to me (20+ juicings). Just realize it is plastic and to do not put too much torque on it. If I feel the tensions getting too high I reverse it, go forward and repeat till it works its self through.Jucied:apples, parsley, cilantro, kale, cucumbers, celery, chardFails with:carrots and beets, these are too firm and may break the unitTakes about 2-3 minutes to clean, easy.Enjoy!"
2,broke 6months,"This juicer for wheatgrass works well for small amounts of grass, in fact it works better than the more expensive cast iron, metal juicer, the auger takes the grass in better. But it is plastic and I put a nice load on grass in (something everyone will do) and the crank just snapped and that was it for Healthy Juicer. So I am using my metal one that I can crank on without fear of it snapping"
3,"Works, in my budget","This juicer is kind of funky, for one, the area where the juice comes out is wayyyyy too close to the edge of the counter, which is worrying. Also, the clamp doesn't work unless there's plenty of counterspace jutting out. I had to use the breakfast bar, which sits above carpet. Again, the issue with juice spilling, or my arm knocking it while cranking is worrying. However, I was able to juice apples and carrots quite well. It's inexpensive, not too difficult to use (and I have NO upperbody strength to speak of)."
3,Very fast delivery,"Thanks for the fast delivery, it was much quicker than I thought. The packaging is also very good. This hand powered juicer can be used anywhere as long as you can find a very smooth surface to attach it on. It's also good with hard veggies such as carrots and cabbages. But it's too small and it takes a lot of time to juice a cup full of veggie juice. I've bought a centrifugal electric juicer before with about the same price, although it produced less dry pulps, but it was powerful and much faster. I will keep this juicer in my collection though, it's good to have it for juicing hard veggies."
1,Pain in the wheatgrass...,"If you like assembling a lot of little plastic parts each time you want to press a shot of wheatgrass, this may be for you. If you like disassembling a lot of little plastic parts to clean after pressing a shot of wheatgrass, order now. If you like your hand pressed wheatgrass all over your countertop and floor, this is just the tool you need. If you are looking for a something that may suction part of your laminate countertops into a tightly lifted air bubble, you have found it. If you are waiting to see the review that guarantees this cheap plastic contraption will gather dust in the back of your cabinets until the next yard sale, here it is! I feel really silly for even trying this juicer."
1,Not Recommended,The 2nd Time I used this juicer I was locking the Juicer to the Cabinet with the handle provided and the knob snapped off. I sent it back
1,weak juicer,"This grass juicer lasted two months. I bought one and returned it thinking I had a ""lemon,"" the replacement unit was not any better. Very difficult to crank the handle for juicing. I'm six foot three and weigh 215 lbs. I recommend saving your money to buy an electric unit."
4,Happygrass,This juicer is great. It is really easy to use and clean. I found that if you crank the handle going forward several turns and then a do a few turns backwards you get more juice from the grass but overall the grass comes out dry so it juices really well. You should realize that it takes quite a bit of grass to get a full two ounces but I have very easily been able to juice a nice 1 oz shot every day with minimal clean up. This is really easy to assemble and keep clean. I wash it after a couple of juices for convenience every other day. It works best if it is clamped to a counter or table for stability.I am very happy with this product and it really beats paying $2.50 per day for a shot and having to drive from place to place to find wheatgrass.
1,didnt work for me,"I bought this for wheatgrass but I tried it and it didnt seem to work very well for that function, you can juice other things in it but I think I got two drips out of it, it would take years to get a cup of wheatgrass juice, probably wont use it again."
2,"My first day with this juicer, and I am MIGHTY FRUSTRATED","First of all, it does not affix to either my dining room table OR my tile countertop. Second, I have done nothing but get wheatgrass and its juice all over everything, except where it's supposed to be. The cup that catches the juice has only a small area to catch the juice, which is near the hand crank, so most of the juice goes on the floor or elsewhere. The juice dispenser ought to be elsewhere, and the cup should AFFIX to the unit, not sit next to it. I am very close to either returning it or throwing it out the window."
3,Good investment for the money,"This machine puts out the juice. I was pessimistic at first based on the all mostly plastic parts, but this machine is solid! My only complaint is using it for wheatgrass. It takesquite a bit of those box types of wheatgrass you buy at the store. I think the juicer would be perfect for the leafy type greens and wheatgrass if the tube that processes it were of a smaller scale. It was excellent at crushing tomatoes and celery. Definitely would recommend this product to anyone wanting to make their own juice. Customer service is by far the best I have encountered on-line."
4,not bad,"you just have to remember its MANUAL. for wheatgrass it works great, but of course being a manual juicer it takes longer than electric, otherwise good product"
3,slow is the key,"this juicer is made well but must be used slow! also you really need a firm smooth area to attach. read the directions before you try to put it together, do not get in a hurry to crank out the juice It does work and clean up is just like anything you must take it apart to clean use the tool to take off the front hands will not do it for the money it is o.k."
3,"Good, but not great","I'm still trying to work with this machine. It doesn't handle the wheatgrass as easily or as quickly as I'd like. The metal piece was making a weird scraping noise that makes it sound like it's not put together properly, so I'm not sure. More later after I monkey with it a bit. It's not intuitive to put together and it doesn't work as well as I had hoped. There are some set up challenges."
1,Piece of Junk - don't waste your money,"This is a piece of junk that tries to do what a stainless steel wheatgrass juicer is designed to do. It is cheaply made, and you will waste your money if you buy this juicer. It is not made to last. Under the stress of juicing wheatgrass, it will crack and break. The gears of the handle are molded lexan plastic, and will not last. The handle will break too under load of wheatgrass. You can crank a stainless steel wheatgrass juicer and not have to worry about the handle breaking in half. The stainless steel crushing blade will also crack at the seams after a bit of use. After a dozen uses, it cracked on each seam. Don't listen to the seller by email, they lie. They said it is tough. That is b******. Get a good stainless steel wheatgrass juicer, and it will last."
1,Disappointed,"I was so excited to get this juicer. There aren't many for wheatgrass on the market at a decent price. Putting it together and washing it can be a bit of a chore, to be honest. And I juice veggies every day with my other juicer, so it's not like I'm not used to washing parts and the whatnot. One has to be very careful to make sure it is secured tightly on the ends, and to the ledge - otherwise you are bound to get a mess. The biggest disappointment has to be that the plastic collecting bin cracked on the 2nd use! Not sure when it cracked - while using it or while washing it in warm, soapy water (I old hand washed it). Not thrilled at all. I think the idea is wonderful, but the execution is poor. Buyer beware."
2,"It leaks & is messy, also the extract is wet, not dry.","If you are on a budget, you can make this work with some experimentation, which is why I gave it 2 stars. For example, you can chew on the smashed wheatgrass when it is extracted from the juice, to get more of the juice out of it. You can stop up the little square hole at the back of the bottom of the grinder with a cotton ball to keep it from leaking...much. As for me, though I am on a budget too, I am buying another one, a stainless steel one that reportedly gives much dryer smashed grass results & hopefully doesn't leak. [Uodate: If you have any tendencies toward carpal tunnel syndrome, don't buy a manual juicer. They will aggravate it badly. I gave up & bought a Green Queen electric model.]"
3,Value?,For a manual juicer it is ok. If one were going to be serious about juicing wheatgrassthey might want to invest in an electric unit.
4,Nice juicer,"I've used the juicer now for about 4 weeks. It was easy to assemble, it comes with clear instructions. The unit is built well, it uses suction to attach to a counter and it does not slip or move when clamped down.overall I would recommend this juicer for someone not wanting to invest $200-$300 in a electric juicer."
3,"Okay Juicer, wheatgrass gets ""jammed""","I got this juicer because I wanted to make wheatgrass for myself rather than buy it at the juice store. The only problem I've found with it, is that it seems to get jammed up pretty easily and doesn't juice the grass as well as I'd like. I have taken the pulp back through it a couple times in order to get more juice out of it. The juice tastes really good though, which may be in part to the wheatgrass seeds I purchased."
4,Just wish there were more for the price!,"My son enjoyed this toy since I got it for him at about 15 months old. He couldn't turn it on and off himself til maybe a couple months later, but he liked playing w/ the gears. Now when he plays w/ it once in a while, he usually leaves it running, but we haven't had to change the batteries very often. Not sure why it's rated for 3+, probably for the small size and stickers, but the smallest gear is about 1 1/2"" in diameter and would be pretty tough to choke on. It's well made. The stickers haven't peeled off after a lot of handling and the magnets are firmly in place. The gears turn very smoothly. It works great on the fridge or on magnetic dry erase boards."
5,Best toy ever for all ages,"I bought my first Gearation for my refrigertor primarily for an 18 months old grandson. He loved it and still goes straight to my refrigerator when he comes in. ... BUT ... everyone else in my family plays with it .. ages from 3 years to 70. It is fascinating, very sturdy, strong magnets, and long lasting battery. I have not had to replace the battery for 6 months. I tell everyone that this is the best toy I have every purchased for the price.Joan in Louisiana"
2,Gearation Refrigerator Magnets,"My grandchildren seem to enjoy these but they are very limited in their play value, especially since they are run by batteries. There are also very few pieces, so there isn't much opportunity for expanding play."
3,Kinda cool,"It is a fun little toy to go on the fridge. The kids like to turn it on and then walk off and leave it. One of the gears makes a clicking sound that can grate on your nerves after awhile, but it is good that it is there so I can hear it and turn it off when the kids walk away. I am a grown up and I want to add more pieces and stuff. I wouldn't say it is for hours of entertainment or anything, but still fun for brief bursts of time."
3,Tomy Gears,I think that my husband and I play with this more than my son does. He is 4 and once in a while he will turn it on but loses interest rather quickly. It is really cute and I would still recommend it.
1,High LEAD Levels,The blackboard contains very high levels of lead...the magnets have medium levels of lead. BE careful with this toy! Check out the details at [...][...]
4,Great for a short while...,My son was very interested and curious about these. Then all the magnets ended up in his toy box and all over the house. He finds the gears interesting by themselves. The main unit is still on the fridge. He'll turn them on (I purchased two sets) and leave. It was a fun toy for... oh ... about a week. I'm still glad I got it though. It really kept his attention even if it was for a short time.
3,A good starting set of gears,"This is a great starting set of gears, but it is quite small and limited. It taught my son how to put the pieces together to make them all work at once. The only complaint I have is that it is a bit loud and gets annoying after a very short time. My son has tons of loud toys, but this one just has a weird clicking sound when one of the gears spins. After a short time, he became bored with the set and we purchased a larger set of gears that are not magnetic and those seem to hold his interest much more."
5,Brilliant,I'm 27 and I still have a lot of fun with this. Bought it initially only as a novelty item to populate my other dull refrigerator. But its become much more than that.I can only imagine how much fun kids would have with this. They'll get initiated on Gear ratios and how to assemble a proper gear pattern. Very very cool.
4,Good product. Engaging for our kids.,"It's a pretty simple toy, and it's not much of a toy for imaginative play, but our boys enjoy playing with it. I think we got our money's worth from this toy.The older one (he has an ""engineer"" personality) especially likes to examine the gears and its geometric relationship as he spins the pieces manually. He has learned to attach gears in a chain, instead of just directly to the main hub.We have a very small apartment with a very small kitchen, so it was a little difficult having them in there to play with it (and magnetic letters) on the refrigerator - we now have them play with the toy on the washer which is in the little space between the living room and the 2nd bedroom - that works well for us."
5,Generation refridgerator magnet,Our little neighbor boy just loves this toy. He is only 22 months so it takes a beating but keeps on going! Sometimes his 4 year old sister gets caught up arranging the wheels for about 30 minutes too.
3,Fun toy for under 2 yr olds,My 14 month old enjoys turning the lever on and off and trying to create a link between the gears. It is very durable as he keeps dropping it on the floor but nothing seems to have broken. I would recommend this product.
4,I got my copy autographed!,"This is a CD single of Jane Wiedlin's song ""World on Fire"". It's a very good song, and there are two mixes of it here. There are also three other songs on the CD, including Jane's biggest solo hit, ""Rush Hour"". The CD comes in a special cover that is designed to look like a matchbook. Here is the track listing:1. World on Fire (LP Version)2. World on Fire (Justin Strauss Mix)3. Tangled (Acoustic Version)4. Lover's Night (Extended Version)5. Rush Hour (7"" Version)"
5,great spatula,"I love this spatula, its really small and cute, and it does an amazing job! OXO products are the best!"
4,blue spatula,"This spatula is as described and shown. The larger handle is curved and enlarged sufficiently to fit the hand well and make it easier to control and manipulate the spatula head effectively. This is an improvement on the straight, narrow handle most other small spatulas have. Another improved aspect of the handle is that is relatively flat on the sides parallel to the flat sides of the spatula head."
4,Smaller than I thought,This spatula is comfortable to use. The only negative was that it was smaller than I thought it would be. It's bigger than the narrow jar ones but not as big as a standard sized spatula. The handle is a little short but comfortable to hold. I wasn't sure exactly what I was getting when I ordered it but I kept it because it works.
1,Networking with Millionaires,"Misleading title! It will not teach you how to LEARN to become a millionaire, it will only teach salesmen how to SELL to millionaires. Too long, (4 cds!) too uninteresting!"
5,"Brassey's Artillery of the World, by Shelford Bidwell","I was very lucky to obtain a copy of this book. I am disappointed that I did not have this book while in service. This book is the best training aid I have personnally reviewed for identifying various artillery pieces that are still being used in many countries today! I also enjoyed it because the majority of the artilery listed was still in use while I was an artilleryman. This book is an excellent book, for reference and historical purposes, with a great many photographs.I wish to congratulate Mr. Shelford Bidwell and all persons in the service of their countries who who made this book possible. Thank you."
2,Mediocre bags at best.,"I will be fair to the seller, these bags provide adequate performance with my electrolux. The problem is the are simply too thin, too much dust and particles get through. If you have light housekeeping, these bags will work just fine for your needs. If you have pets, kids, allergies, or respiratory problems I would advise you to try a different bag. Thus far the Electrolux anti-allergen bag has been great. Of course I am always looking for a good alternative. Again this is a good bag for light housekeeping, but that's all."
4,"Nice Bags, Nice Price",.The quality seems fine so far. The bag material is a heavy-enough white paper that feels as if there is some cotton content. The attachment panel and rubber gasket seem fine.Not yet enough experience with these to give 5 stars.
5,Better than originals,"Well worth the price, works perfect, and fits perfect I won't need bags for a while and when I do I will reorder from here"
4,Cheapest bags I've found,"Look around... so with the shipping and price, the cheapest we have found...Double check your bag size before ordering...Be BlessedLliam"
3,still have this camera,"I still use, it was my first digi camera bought it in 2003 or 2004? cant remember but it still works but not that good, dropped a few times. it uses lots of battery juice. Rechargables dont work long in it. I paid about [...] or so then. wowwww how things come down"
3,"Not Made in New Zeland, But Rather China","I looked carefully at the product photo before ordering this blade and it says ""Made in New Zealand"". But, the one which actually arrived says Made in China. Somehow I wonder if the materials and construction are still the same. I haven't cut with it yet, but you should know what you are getting. Personally I think Amazon should be required to post country of origin information with their product listings. When I buy in person at a store that information is always available to me, but on Amazon it isn't."
2,not my first choice,i bought this gun about a year ago and still never had a problem with it. its made out of pretty solid plastic so if you break it you must be geniuse(hope thats how you spell it). its not very accurate over a long distance better for indoor or close combat. its got ok power and the magazine sucks you have to feed it one bb at a time.
2,"Okay, when its not broken","I bought a gun simular to this one and it shot okay. It didnt go through the cardboard, it just bounced back. The FPS wasnt very good. Within about 5 days the thing broke. Its VERY inaccurate at about 25 and above feet, and the BBs drop really quick. Its a good gun if your going to use it in the house, but for airsoft wars, horrible. Also the Laser thing is a scope that has a + sign, personally I would've preferred a dot."
3,It was ok...,"The color is a bit off from what is shown and not exactly what I was looking for. However, I did like that it's very creamy. While I won't be using this often, again, not the color I was expecting, I will use it now and then."
5,Well rounded,"John H., Phd Martin constructed a well-rounded neuroanatomical textbook. The material covers every anatomical aspect of the n.s. including chapters on embryonic development and vascular anatomy. The text is continuously tied in with detailed images (ct, mri, & myelin stained slices of c.n.s.). The reading material is exceptionaly easy for its class. The book gets very detailed, and will make you a leading source on neuroanatomy. Author comment: ""Even though this book came out a few years back in '96, the material today is still very similar and they do not get any user-friendlier."""
4,"""Really acceptable""","First functional then regional anatomy, not a bad idea. Makes u hard to forget, good ""real"" diagrams."
4,Great source!,The book is easy to follow and understand and has simple diagrams that complement the reading.
3,"I expected more, 3 3/4 stars","I expected more from this album,""will rap for food."" I'm not saying it is a complete waste of doe, but i felt like a lot of the tracks were directed towards people that were depressed, and im not saying i don't like deep songs about trying to get by in life, but they lyrics and the beats on some of the tracks reminded me of some corn lincoln parks stuff. But to tell the truth some of the tracks are nice, like ""Lynguistics"" ""Mic Like A Memory"" ""616 Rewind"" ""halfanimal"" these tracks are nice and some others. Overall i would rather buy a nice BCC album like ""Dah Shinin"" by smif N wessun. Those are the true classics or ""Nocturnal"" by heltah skeltah."
5,HEY CRACKA CRACK,"this review is going straight out to ""cracka crack"", who gave this album the only 1 star review, dude your entire review simply read "" cornball garbage"" .... if this is considered cornball music to you than you need to go listen to your puff daddy cd while you have a mocha frappachino because what you previously thought was hip hop actually turned out to be fecal matter. listen bro, these guys are original and innovative, from the beats to the rhymes they simply own it....effortlessly blending quazi loops of ecclectic beats coupled with the flow and delivery of 2 of hip hops best mc's. this is true undergroound hip hop, they have been around this long only because they can produce pure fire every time they touch wax. so do us all a favor why don't you pull out your IPOD nano and put in your ear pieces and just bump some of that new justin timnerlake cuz we don't need ya!!!...HAHAHAHAHAH"
4,A Very Dope Album,"After hearing about this group for sometime, I finally decided to check out they're first album ""Will Rap For Food"" and I was shocked, its a great album.The lyrics in this album are really good. I felt a lot of them, and the idea of ""Fukinwichu"" was cool. But yea these guys can spit hands down, some of the songs got some feeling to but yea good stuff.The production is very dope. I basically like every beat on this album. Some beats that I like alot are ""Lynguistics"", ""Mic Like A Memory"", ""Half Animal, Half Man"", 616 Rewind"", ""Missing Children"". This album is basically a true Hip-Hop album, lyric wise and production wise.After I listen to this album more, I'm going to definitely check out the ""Southernunderground"" album. But overall, I highly recommend this album to all true Hip-Hop heads!!My Top 5 Songs1.Lynguistics2.Mic Like A Memory3.Half Animal, Half Man4.Missing Children5.616 Rewind"
4,terrific,"If you like Cunninglynguists, then how could you not like this album???? It's classic material by them, their first installment to the world."
4,Buy this!,"Deacon and Kno combine to make CunninLynguists, but that's not all. They come together to create a album that will have you rewinding over and over. Every time you listen to this album you will notice another thing that you like about it and something you never realized. To this day I enjoy something new about this album everytime I listen to it. You wont be sorry you bought it. And I'll let you in on a little secret... their 3rd album will be out in the near future so it will be a great idea to see what they are all about with the 2 discs already out."
3,Ok for the price,"When I received this, it certainly wasn't as I expected. The materials are a little on the lower end scale side, but I suppose you get what you pay for. I certainly didn't expect for the bodice to be so flimsy, and be attached to the overskirt. Anyway, if you're looking for a costume with better quality that will hold up, I suggest spending a few more dollars, it's probably worth it. This is just too ""cheap costume"" like for me to even think about wearing to the Renaissance Faire."
3,Two long songs,"Not bad, but not my favorite. Well done drone ambient, with some interesting things going on in the background and foreground. I may decide to keep it."
3,Nice lightweight banjo case,"This is a nice lightweight banjo case. I'll retire my hardshell case and use this case all the time. Overall construction is very nice with plenty of storage inside for capo, picks, etc. The zipper works good & the top stays open when loading the banjo.The downside on this case is the shoulder straps which prevent me from rating it a ""5"". They are cheesy and lightweight. The snaps bent when I connected them to the case. I had to throw them away and use some nice shoulder straps from my Blue Heron autoharp case. I considered returning the case but I was able to do some ""consumer prep"" on it and make it a nice case.I would not recommend this case if double shoulder straps are important in the transport of your banjo."
5,Banjo Case,"Just received this banjo case and I tell you this. I am so very pleased. Exceeded my expectations then some. Whoever complained about the straps, don't let that review throw you like it almost did me. I could hook these up to my truck and pull another truck. Thank you."
5,Unique and wonderful experience,Love songs for the wicked is a beautiful composition of truly unique songs. The dusky loveliness of the music combined with the fun lyrics makes this great listening music for both home and travel. I wish some book stores and coffee shops would play their music because it is a perfect fit. Some songs make me what to dance around in my bare feet while others make me want to grab a blanket and sip on a steaming cup of tea. All together this CD is a celebration of life in its infinite variety!
5,Nice for corn bread,I love corn bread and this pan makes it very well. I like to do my cornbread from scratch and it usually is great to eat. This pan works very nicely with only the thinnest coating of butter on its sides. It cleans very easily also.
5,Dont know why more people dont have them,"I bought these speakers five years ago. no problems yet and no need for any customer service. They have suervived two moves and make clear, loud sound. I love the speakers I came to see If I could buy some more for my dad."
5,Changed my life.,"This Woman's insight to the human condition put into words feeling I've had for many years. For example; I've never could understand how otherwise rational people could tell me in all honesty that Bill Clinton was a good man. Ayn Rand says in Atlas Shrugged, "" People do not believe in the irrational, but they do believe in the unjust."" Even if you can't read the book, try this CD for the next long trip in your car."
3,Cheap,"We had no problems with the selller, but we were a little disappointed with the product. The oter cross is very weak. These come with the inner cross inside the outer cross and upon our struggle to remove the inner cross we went the out part. It was ok, they serve the purpose but would have wanted something a bit higher quality."
3,Exciting adventure,"Jane is a freelance journalist in Vermont whose relationship with her girlfriend (using the term loosely) is coming to an end. She and her best friend Victoria both have a fierce love of horses, so when a horse Victoria considered buying is brutally murdered, Jane can't help but get involved in the investigation, especially since the police aren't doing anything. All too quickly, Jane is hurled into danger. The trail takes her to Montana, where she encounters a strong woman who helps her in more ways than one. Overall, the story and characters would've benefitted from more exposition. It seemed like I was being hurried through the book so Jane could get on with things, whereas I would have much rather lingered. ""Night Mare"" is an exciting adventure that leaves the reader begging for a sequel."
3,Not recomended for cold weather,"My husband is a redskins fan. When we just got it, he was so happy because it looks very cool. We live in VA so it gets cold, my poor hubby's hands freeze everytime he drives. They will get hot in the summer but it's not too bad."
3,More fundamental than I expected,Gergen is a great writer and always has sound material to offer. I just found this volume a little more basic than I expected. But content was good.
3,Just From Experience at a Friends House,"This car works great on wooden floors for kids but if you want to ride with your kid, or by yourself while playing tag with your kids then your better off buying the flying turtle because your legs will have a hard time staying on this car. You also don't have to tighten anything with the flying turtle. The only downside to the flying turtle is that a kid has to be taller to use it two year olds would be to small."
1,mp3,Just yesterday it was fine but today I tried to get it to work it is stone cold dead. I almost fell for the well put together mp3 with at least four stars well what difference a day makes. With any notice it went dead not to ever play again. I wish I could have gotten my money back too. You learn as you live!!!Mickie
2,Was Great At First....,this was a great mp3 at first i loved it... the only thing weird is it says it holds 2gb but after u put so many songs on it which ain't much maybe 30 songs they just start disappearing and what I mean is if you hook to the computer the new songs are there but you can't find them on the mp3 when wanting to play them. I had mine for almost a year until the other day I hooked to my computer to charge and when it was done charging I went to unplug it and the screen froze and after 2 hours it just went dead and won't power on at all. Too bad its way too late to send it back but this purchase is a bad idea and I would stay clear of if I was anyone else. If I had the choice again I wouldn't have bought it and listened to reviews at the time. So do yourself a favor and save up for the ipod I know I will be.
3,Bottle wasn't full,The bottle was only 3/4th full which maybe is ok since it did say it was a tester. But it was also leaking. You could smell the perfume even outside the shipping box.
5,All beginners - buy this,"This is a must for beginners at backgammon. Paul's writing style is clear and easy to read, making the most complicated concepts manageable. Each chapter is peppered with warnings and tips, highlighting the most important points. The exercises at the end of each section ensure that you have understood and remembered what you have learnt. My copy is well worn, but my game has changed beyond recognition and I keep going back to it."
5,This is the best beginner book out there!,"Hey I've read most of the backgammon books. Some are more comprehensive and some are better in certain areas but this book is the BEST book for a beginner. It is not a simple here's how you play book. It introduces a lot of complex ideas for strategy, doubling, math, and counting pips in a compact book. If you are a fairly new player and especially if you are playing for money with friends or at a backgammon club, then you should read this first---that's why it's named ""Starting out in backgammon"". Then of course move on to the more advanced books. While you are at it, download GNU Backgammon (free) which has a tutor mode. Backgammon is a lot of fun and if you're going to play, you may as well win when you can."
3,Disappointed,I am disappointed in this product...The description for it quotes that the wool is an inch deep but mine is not at all and also very thin and sparse - nothing like what I expected for Australian/NZ wool (I should know since I come from Australia) and nothing like the photo - the picture shows a lush sheepskin with the baby's hands disappearing in to the wool...a baby's hand/fingers would not disappear in to the one I received... not the quality which was described nor what I expected after reading the other reviews
1,My mechanic said he wouldn't install this on my vehicle,"I have a very trusted mechanic, he said this belt look like it been sitting on the shelf for years or was used. He said it just simply didn't look right and would not recommend putting it on my vehicle"
1,Why?,"What on Earth would you need a guide to this game for? The game is so simple and straight forward. All Guides are good for is walkthroughs, and maybe some special moves, but this game tells you where to go, and there aren't really any special moves. So why buy it?"
5,Does exactly what it's supposed to... looks and feels nice too!,I've never bothered with a pizza slice before but finally decided it was time. This one works wonderfully and cuts through even thick crusty pizzas in one movement. It washes up perfectly in the dishwasher and has a nice 'weightiness' and feel to it too. Definitely would recommend.
5,"Solid, well made pizza cutter",The pizza cutters at the local kitchen supply have a thin handle and only one leg supporting the cutting wheel - this one has two legs - it won't fold under pressure!
3,Pizza Cutter,Its kinda lose where the cutter is kinda wonder how long it will work. And its a cheep stainles steel it may rust soon too dont leave it in the water. Good stainless steel is where a magnet wont stick to it. Im not saying its not stainless steel but i work with stainless steel so i know about it.I do like the handle its got a lot to hold on to makes it easyer to cut the pizza.
2,No more oxo,"This is not a good product, oxo I have found is really over hiped. I purchased one of these and would not buy another. Unless you take the pizza out of the pan it will not cut. I make only fresh pizza in my house and if you use a stone be sure you never try to cut the pizza on it with this wheel. No more oxo for me."
2,WOBBLY,"After searching through the comments, there were some people who said this roller arrived and the blade was wobbly, but there really isn't enough emphasis on this.This product arrived for me and while the handle is very solid, there is too much play in the blade itself which makes it seem flimsy. With the wiggle room from side to side, the tip of the blade touches the metal spoke and makes an unpleasant sound while rolling.I've decided to keep it because in the end it's just a pizza cutter, but I definitely would not give this the rating it has."
4,It cuts!,"We needed a pizza wheel... As a kid I grew up in a store that sold a TON of pizza, so I had been spoiled when it comes to this utensil. This one is nice and sturdy, cuts very cleanly and seems to be quite durable. The handle is also nicely designed to not slip and feels full in my hand, not like some of the tiny bargain cutters."
5,Perfect Pizza Wheel,"I've lost track of how many OXO products I own, but I do know I have reviewed quite a few on Amazon. I don't think I've ever owned anything by OXO that I haven't liked a lot which is why I have stuck with the brand. This pizza cutter is no exception. I recently got a microwave/pizza oven and am so delighted with the gooey warm pizzas that have been coming out of it that my pizza wheel has been getting plenty of use. The round blade/cutting edge when applied with slight pressure provides a sharp and well define cut on a pizza or a fruit tart. One cut tends to do it with no repeat passes. This kitchen tool is easy to clean and it is durable. A simple soap and water wash is pretty much all that is needed. When I am exceptionally lazy or just forgetful, I've tossed it in the dishwasher with no ill effects. It is comfortable to hold and it is an easy and efficient way to take care of what might be an otherwise messy job."
5,"Like most Oxo products, excellent","A large wheel, nicely angled and a good grip make this a no-effort pizza wheel. Some of the other manufacturers have lots of wobble in the wheel, making it difficult to cut straight and apply even pressure. This wheel is comfortable to use and the manufacturing tolerance is impressive for something as inexpensive as this. Highly recommended."
3,Pretty dry,"I listened to an unabridged recording of this book, and found it distant and uninvolving. Asprey seems to rely heavily on the official records rather than first-hand accounts. Indeed, the first-hand accounts are fairly few and far between. I was never tempted to quit listening; Asprey keeps things moving at a pretty quick pace. But he seems to assume that the reader knows what is going on in trench warfare and in actual combat. There was little of visceral, jarring descriptions of fighting to which we've become accustomed today, and which really drives home the horror and the fear of it. Asprey keeps things at a official-sounding, abstract level for most of the book."
5,Be far warned; VERY LARGE!,"Inside this massive well packed box was a very beautiful and LARGE awesome Mopani wood. So so beautiful. It was actually hard to decide which side to put in viewing area of my angelfish tank. Very neat and also a great place for plants to grow and hidden cave like dentures great for small tetras!!! So love this piece, cannot wait for all my friends to see this!"
3,"Not horrible, but not great either.","The piece I received is about 22""x12""x4"". It's pretty flat and 2 dimensional. Looks very cool though. I'll just go down to the river and collect driftwood next time."
5,Bigger than advertised,"The description says 24"" x 10"" x 12"". Mine was 32"" x 10"" x 6"". I'll take it! So it wasn't as high as claimed (Mopani is rather 2-dimensional by nature) but the extra length and the beauty of the piece make up for it. The wood is excellently textured and knarled. It even has two arches/tunnels where one side of the branch wasn't completely worn away. It will look fabulous covered with java ferns."
2,Never ending tannin release,"Nice big piece of wood, that would have looked amazing in my tank, but it never stopped releasing tannins. I've done regular 20-30% water changes every two weeks, for almost 5 months, but a permanent tea color stained the water the entire time. At times I even tried to do a 50% water change, hardly any difference. I boiled it as well. Found it frustrating, as I could handle a little tannin release, but would rather look at a 'clean' aquarium. I wouldn't recommend this wood if you want good visibility inside your water tank, probably perfect for a dry environment."
2,Don't put in a fish tank,"I read all of the other reviews, and expected to need to soak the wood in water. However, i soaked it in hot water in the bath tub for 2 weeks (changing it every time I remembered) and it still leeched. Then I soaked it outside in a kiddie pool for another week. Finally decided to see if the tanks filters could handle the tannins. After 3 weeks of tea colored water I took it out. My tank returned to it's clear color within a few days. The piece of wood itself is beautiful! However, wouldn't put it in a fish tank. Instead the wood will be used in one of my other pet's tanks--hermit crabs or reptiles, so I am going to store it for now. To replace it, I purchased a beautiful piece of resin wood and my tank looks great!"
4,Great Blade,Aggressive cut. Blade stays sharp longer than most. Oregon knows how to cut wood. I would buy again. Price was very competitive
4,Other Comment misguided,"I just read a reviewer who said this is sauce is not authentic. Then the reviewer went on to list their version of authentic Pad Thai sauce (that they had obtained online. As if this meant it was authentic. Ha!). Their recipe had rice vinegar and paprika. Odd.Most Pad Thai sauces in Thailand are made with tamarind, palm sugar and salted radish -as Taste of Thai's sauce does.There are numerous variations on Pad Thai sauce throughout Thailand. Every chef makes his or hers in their own way. However, usually tamarind, garlic, shallot, fish sauce, sugar, chili pepper play roles in their creations."
4,"Tasty, I was surprised!","I bought this product at my local grocery store because I couldn't find an ingredient on our ""from scratch"" pad thai recipe. I was super surprised, this sauce is pretty tasty. I followed the directions on the back of the package (with chicken) and everyone in my family liked it. My husband even commented that he liked the flavor of this more than our local take-out Thai place (which we LOVE). In the future I think I would add two packets of sauce, but seriously I'm planning on keeping this as a pantry staple from now on! Very yummy!!"
2,Nasty!!!,This pad thai sauce is gross. i have had many and it doesnt taste anything like the original. if you want really good pad thai sauce get the stuff from thai kitchen. that is much better.
2,"Meh, too sweet for me","I love pad thai. I bought this sauce hoping to recreate my favorite dish from a local thai restaurant.Conlusion? It just isnt the same. Reading the ingredients, this is definetly not ""authenic"". Palm Sugar, Tamarind, Soy Sauce, Shallot, Pickled Radish, Garlic, Soybean Oil, Salt, Chili.Its too sweet for me. I just dont really like it. This sauce uses ALOT of tamarind, you can see the chunks in it. I'm pretty sure that my local Thai restaurant does not use tamarind, their sauce is not as dark brown. (Maybe thats the Americanized Pad Thai?)I found a Pad Thai sauce recipe online and I think I will use instead of this sauce.2 1/2 Tbs. brown sugar1 Tbs. lime juice2 1/2 Tbs. Thai Kitchen Premium Fish Sauce1 Tbs. rice vinegar1 tsp. paprika (optional)"
2,"It's not a 5/8"" arbor","Just some kind of misunderstanding somewhere along the line, I am sure, but this blade does not have a 5/8"" arbor, it has a 10mm arbor, which is 3/8"". So I returned it. No biggie, but the ad should be changed to reflect the blade's true arbor size."
5,A Must Read!,"This book will be a great addition to any teachers, managers, or parents bookshelves. It explores the psychology of intrinsic (vs. extrinsic) motivation and shows how supervisors, and other people in ""one-up"" positions, can be more than managers, but true leaders who foster autonomous, authentic growth and responsible decision-making in their subordinates. A must read for anyone who recognizes the lack of responsiblity and accountability in people today and would like to foster positive change in our schools, our companies, and our society."
3,"Autonomy, competence and relatedness","This is a very interesting book to read if you are a leader in your organization, a coach, a parent or have a role leading or motivating people.It does not have an easy flowing style and could well be re-edited and updated to include the changes technology has brought up in how we communicate and create social networks.A lot of emphasis is put on self-motivation and respecting autonomy, yet I could not envision how to apply it in the business world.The consideration of three fundamental human needs: autonomy, competency and relatedness is very interesting.a good read to understand how to encourage autonomy. I wonder about its applicability for self-determination in groups of people, within an organization or a society."
5,Great Book,This was a wonderful book that really helped me out with motivating my students. It also helped with my classroom management. I would recommend this book to any teacher.
3,ok,"This book is ok, but the author seems a little self interested. The motivation concepts are good, but My advice would be to read the Mindset by Carol Dweck. Understanding intrinsic motivations is very interesting and she explores this a lot more effectively with the basics of labeling and self labeling."
3,THIS NOVEL PROVES CRIME PAYS!,"Only a national success about the Parisienne underworld in the early 1800's, featuring stark realism but no socially redeeming qualities; an inferior mediocre work from the same pen who wrote a World class internationally successful serialized novelization and single most celebrated treatment of the ""Wandering Jew"", now available from SALE (""Salt-of-the-Earth"") ISBN 1-895507- www.wanderingjew.freehomepage.com"
3,Nice case but it smells awful,Functionally I love this case.It holds the nook very securely.It feels nice and sturdy in your hand.I was able to fold it back and hold it quite comfortably.I like having a pocket on the inside front cover.The only problem is that after two weeks I still can't get over the smell. I've had leather products before and have never had a problem but when I hold this cover the chemical smell is overwhelming.If you're not sensitive to chemical smells then this is a great case. Sadly I'm looking for a new case.
4,Seems like a decent case,"The case seems to be overall made well. The stitching is straight, the magnetic clasp works well and the Nook retaining elastic and corners seem to hold the reader securely in place. The interior is a gray cloth that is a microfiber type of material that I suppose is intended to appear like suede. Overall, the case generally looks nice.The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I have my doubts that this is made of genuine leather. It seems to me that the case is just a rubberized vinyl with a leather look to it. I have asked the company for clarification. They have responded with comment that the item is indeed leather. At this price, I'll take their word for it.As for smell, there is an initial rubbery smell that seems to dissippate to almost nothing over the space of a few days. It shouldn't be a negative consideration.Edit: The case is overall leather. The latch and the pocket are not."
4,Good quality for great price,"I didn't want to spend an arm and a leg to get a cover for my Nook, just so I could say 'I own a Kate Spade Nook cover!!'. That said, there isn't a lot out there that isn't expensive and also not ""cheap"" or ""tacky"" - this was truly a great find. The overall quality is good; the construction looks sound, it doesn't have an obnoxious smell, the snap works consistently and well, and it looks sharp. Overall I would definitely recommend this to someone who wants a simple, understated cover that doesn't break the budget."
5,My Nook Cover,My Nook is now protected by this cover and is easy to use. The snap fastner is hard to snap but I'm getting better at it. Have received several great product reviews from other Nook owners who plan on getting one for their use. Have several Kindle owners wondering if it would fit their reader and am sure they will buy one if it will. Amazon did a great job getting the product to me.A very satisfied customerDick Basler
3,does nit fit properly,the one corner strap that holds the Nook in place is right on the off/on switch and have to leave that corner unstrapped
4,Back to Basics,"The only thing that is funky on this product is the magnetic clasp. At first I thought I had it backwards, but it is as the picture shows in the ad. The strap folds behind to the right. . .This doesn't bother me in the least and the product protects my Nook for travel. The exterior is soft and easy to grip. The interior is has a suede feel to it. I love the side pocket- great for putting odds and ends or a slim line note pad.Good buy for the price. :)"
4,Nice leather case for Nook,"The case is of good leather quality and does protect the Nook. It fits snuggly and you can read with the case on. I would have liked the case to have covered the sides and top and bottom of the Nook, protecting it if it is dropped on its side. It also had a chemical smell that lasted quite a few weeks. Overall, I really like the cover and think it is a good item for the price."
5,Great quality for a reasonable price.,"This case for the Nook is high quality and very sturdy. The clasp that holds it closed has a magnetic snap to keep it in place. It snaps on the back of the case, not the front. This ensures that the metal snap does not touch the Nook screen. This neat design feature reduces the chance for damaging your Nook. The cover will also fold all the way behind the nook, which keeps the cover from getting it in the way if you read lying down. I think this case rivals the quality of the more expensive cases at a very reasonable price."
2,Otherwise Good Cover Ruined by Design Flaw,"I liked this cover until I brought my Nook on vacation, and had two occasions when the Nook fell out of the case. This happens because while two of the corners are held in with elastic straps, the other two straps are fashioned with strips of cloth that are sown in the shape of a pocket, and both of them quickly became loose with wear. Based on that problem, I cannot recommend this product."
2,Nook case - with clasp and simulated leather.,"I thought this would fit my nook better.The clasp seems to thick.Overall, just looks cheap to me.I did not use this at all and it was a bad purchase.Maybe some people will like this and I'm too picky.This case is more like a $10 case at most.Currently I use just a regular ""slip"" case that haseneoprene for the padding... I had this first and thoughtthe other one would work better.Also, if this is leather then I don't know what leatherlooks like. Looks simulated leather to me, or if leatherit is very cheap. I have had simulated leather cases thatlook better. Matter of fact, I have s simulated case formy iPad and I LOVE it. So, the problem is not that it'snot leather. Just looks cheap to me and not all that wellmade.Basically, I ""thought"" I would be able to use it while inthis case. IF I have to remove the nook, it loses it'svalue. That is probably why I only used this case a day or 2.Another bad purchase."
1,Nook cover,This cover arrived in a timely fashion but it was constructed backwards and upside down. Ok of you don't mind having the embossed label on the front and the clasp on the back.
1,nook case,"The reader, protector, and case came as a package deal. The reader was great. However, neither the protector nor case fit. I have resolved the issue with the protector but have not resolved the case issue. I AM NOT PLEASED with this purchase."
1,crap quality,"Very Very disappointed when this arrived. Crappy quality, poor workmanship.Will probably last about a month if I don't send it back tomorrow."
4,Like it.,"The nook cover is a good value for the money, providing adequate protection for the nook. It beats paying $30 for a similar cover at WalMart."
3,Good Case,"Good nook case has a sleek look and is pretty functional. The only problem i had was that the item was backordered and didnt tell me until a few days after i ordered, but it still came before Christmas so I cant complain"
3,"Not as good as Talisman, but solid","This book is fine, but does not live up to the standard of the Talisman.I notice that many reviwers feel that there is some conflict with this and the Dark Tower series. Having never read those books, I was able to comfortably associate this and The Talisman, based on the desciptions and people in both. I was, however, left with a desire to learn more about Roland and the Dark Tower series, which I will read in the future.This story focuses more on present day USA, which is where it falls in comparison to The Talisman, whose strength lay in its descriptions of the alternate world called The Territories.Good book, but less mentally stimulating than its prequel."
1,These guys sure could do better.,"This is just another Dark Tower installment, mostly made up of Mr. King's schtick. This book lacks the solid plotting that the Talisman has. Plot elements and devices are brought up and made a big deal of, then dropped, and other elements come out of the blue. Geez, I'm disappointed."
1,"Horrible book, horribly disappointing","I very much liked the Talisman, and was excited to read Black House. I could not get past page 44. The writing style was awful. Everything is in present tense and is described as though you are floating through town with the author. But the topic of child murders was even harder to get through. Not just child murders, but murder and cannibalism of young kids. This was much gorier than it needed to be to get the point across. If you have children of your own, you may have a hard time getting through this book. Hug your kids instead."
1,owwww,"Please, someone kill me so I don't have to finish this book. What overwrought garbly-gook boring nonsense. I can't even be mature about it. Spare me King at his worst -- I've avoided his Dark Tower fantasy stuff only to find mention of it creeping into this one. No wonder it's so bad. The cover should have warned me what I was getting into.What ever happened to that imagination of his that helped you to ignore the over-writing? This book is a waste of brain space, his and mine."
2,Too graphic for me...,"While I am a heavy-duty Stephen King fan, I was disappointed with this book. I just read The Talisman about 2 years ago and it was a good read even though it was a bit dry here and there. I was very excited to hear about The Black House as it is the long awaited sequel to The Talisman. This story is also a bit dry in a good many places (Stephen King should stick to writing alone - the stories are always better). However, as the mother of a young daughter, I was shocked and horrified at the graphic detail in which a murder scene of a child is described. I can handle pretty much any murder and mayhem King can dish out when it involves adults. If it does involve a child, I know King can get the point across without describing it in such detail. That's just plain disturbing. I was very disappointed. I expect more from Stephen King and he usually delivers."
2,BAG OF BONES,"FOR STARTERS I'M NOT A WRITER. BUT I'VE BECOME USED TO A CERTAIN LEVEL OF SUSPENSE,HORROR AND HUMOR FROM MR. KING. BAG OF BONES WAS NOT UP TO HIS USUAL STANDARDS. AND PLEASE NO MORE DARK TOWER. I REALLY DON'T CARE ANY MORE IF ROLAND FINDS THE MAN IN BLACK OR THE TOWER, ACTUALLY I WAS HOPING BLAINE THE TRAIN WOULD RUN THEM ALL OVER, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF OY, MAYBE. MR. KING SHOULD STICK WITH FAR OUT STUFF LIKE INSOMNIA WHICH I THROUGHLY ENJOYED."
3,Black House,"The book was ok in typical King/Straub fashion. However the writers seemed to have a hard time being harmonious, thus making the read somewhat jerky."
3,I can't wait for the next one,"This book is really more of King's creation than Straub's. The Talisman was a wonderful, imaginative book. Black House is pretty good as an installment of the (endless!) Dark Tower series. At any rate, it was nice to hear about the Ted Brautigan character in ""Black House"" too, just to find out what became of him after the novella ""Low Men in Yellow Coats"". The book is a bit dark, but certainly entertaining."
1,Terrible,"I read the Talisman a long time ago. Then I got this book, and decided that before I jumped into it, I should re-read the Talisman.I cannot begin to describe the disappointment of attempting to read Black House only hours after finishing the Talisman. The way the story is told is just horrible. The whole ""we"" thing is completely unbearable. Simply put- the writing style was so bad I couldn't read the book. I had to put it down after only a few pages, for fear I would vomit.I skipped several hundred pages just to see if that particular writing style persisted throughout the entire book, and it appears that it did. I was horrified.So yeah, it's a horror book. Just not what I wanted. Unreadible. I'm sure, somewhere in between the terrible prose there is a story worth reading about, but I couldn't get there. I'm disappointed to say the least."
2,Overdone,"They try to be creative in their narrative but it doesn't work. It's like an actor doing asides, they're letting us in on a secret instead taking us through a story. Didn't work for me."
2,A Complete Disappointment,"I don't know whether it is because I was so excited about the sequel to my favorite novel and ruined it for myself, but Blackhouse is a total disgrace and a bore to read, until around page 500. Even the ending is a disappointment by The Talisman's standards. Where it takes me less than a week to finish one of King's novels, this book took me 2 months! It was just out of pure respect for King that I finished this novel otherwise I would have returned it after the second chapter."
1,Yuck!,"I just finished reading the TALISMAN (again) the day I got BLACK HOUSE. I started reading BLACK HOUSE today and I doubt whether I will finish it. This has happened to me with many of King's newer books. I feel like I am wading through a quagmire of words that threaten to suffocate me with their imagery. It is just too much! Especially in the light of recent events, I find it difficult to read a book that on first read appears to be so unrelentingly grim. If I were you, I would wait until you can get it at the library. Something this dark needs to be read when there is a glimmer of light somewhere."
1,"""Totally disappointing.""","Being a fairly new reader of the macabre, I felt like reading a book by the master of terror (Stephen King). Considering the synergistic power of two famous authors, I thought this book would be the ultimate. I felt that my time in reading this book was a waste of six+ hours, and would advise readers to read other materials. Every strange twist and turn in this story was totally predictable. The topic, while gruesome and sadistic, seemed almost normal. I was hoping to be gripping an armrest and losing sleep as I read this book. This definitely wasn't the case. I do believe that with a lot of re-structuring, this would make a fabulous horror film. especially if directed by Mr. King. I was far from impressed."
1,MAJOR letdown.....,"It is hard for me to believe that any fans of the TALISMAN couldfind anything to like in this 'Sequel.' So many missed opportunities....no sense of wonder, no time spent in the Territories, no interesting POV's from a villain to help sustaininterest (SO unlike the memorable evil of the first book).It is obvious that Straub just let SK take the reins; why not,this book will sell more copies than PS's last 5 books combined.The ""Dark Tower"" stuff is mostly just silly, and I think it issad that this book was published at all....how could he NOT haveintroduced Henry to the Territories...the only interesting character in the book (including JACK), and we don't evenget to see his extraordinary senses reaction to the Territories.If King/Straub had written this 20 years ago, it would have beena MUCH, MUCH better book. As it is written, it is completelypointless and un-necessary."
1,Artificial Style Overcomes Plot!,"Why do authors feel they have to interpose an artificial style between the readers and the story?Although the plot and characters were fascinating, the precious and condescending stylistic devices employed by the authors made this book almost unreadable. As a fairly enthusiastic fan of both authors, I anticipated another thrilling ride...but unfortunately the authors chose to tell their story in a highly obtrusive style in which the narrative voice takes on the persona of your 6th grade teacher, constantly reminding you that you are reading a book rather than experiencing a story.Too bad...it could have been really good."
4,"Folks, this is a nice ride. Gratefully NOT a rehash.","Simply put, if you liked the ideas of multiple worlds in ""The Talisman"", then thius murder mystery with a twist is for you. That kind of statement usually sends me away, repelled, but it really fits here. Also soem great suprises for fans of The Dark Tower series and I beleive, also The Stand..... ( maybe i was reading to far into it.)"
2,"The DT information was good, but...","the plot's a little thin, the writing style is very rambling and confusing, and it will make very little sense to someone who hasn't read the DT series or the Talisman.Also, I found Jack Sawyer to be extremely irritating. He's handsome, rich, good at everything he tries, everyone (with the exception of the ""bad guys"") are in awe of him through the entire book, and of course, he's one of the Best Cops Ever. Gag.In case you couldn't tell, I'm pretty dissapointed. Both these authors are capable of much better."
3,What a SLOOOWWW start!,"I had a very hard time getting past the first 100 pages. I'm not sure that it's up to the level of the Tallisman, but it's still a good read."
4,nice book,"i just finished this book a couple of days ago and it is a great second part to the talisman. the first hundred or so pages were a pain almost to get through then once it hit page 150 the book disappered faster than a pizza at a weight watchers convention.if you read the talisman read this, or if read the dark tower then read the talisman then black house, you won't be disappointed."
4,"Wonderful, if a king fan.","This book is a great piece, if the reader is familiar with King's former work, and I would say reading the Talisman is necessary. If your a Towers fan, then you'll enjoy this. When meet old acquaintances in this book, like Bobby Dulac, and Bruatigan is even mentioned. The first half is slow, but it definently picks up towards the middle, so stick with it. This book wasn't really suspenseful, as many of King's others have been- this time, the boys are simply telling a story. I loved the way that this book was written, and it was an enjoying read."
2,Not a good addition to the Dark Tower series,"I ordered this book the instant it was available because on Stephen King's web site it says:""For those of you who are Dark Tower fans, Black House will answer many questions you may have about the Crimson King, who/what are Breakers, how does Ted Brautigan fit in, etc. It will be the closest thing to a DT novel you'll see before the fall of the Year Three ('03).""Hopefully Black House is the farthest thing from the Dark Tower novels I hope to see in 2003. Of the 640 pages about 5 of them related to the Dark Tower series. After the literary triumph that was Wizard and Glass, Black House falls short of what you would expect from Stephen King. Let us do remember that this book was co-authored by Peter Straub, who will hopefully play no part in the Dark Tower books to come.Independent of my Dark Tower expectations this book would have gotten three stars from me as there were some entertaining elements but it moved too slowly to rate any higher."
3,Hmmmm....,"I am having a lot of difficulty typing this review. I am having the same difficulty trying to really like this book. I have been a fan of Stephen King's for 24 years and have read every one of his books. This is not one of his better ones.First of all, this is not the Talisman, it is after the fact and as fans, we do not want to believe that life goes on and changes. Well, guess what? it does and there are some things that us, as readers, are just not going to like in this book, but. . .Anyways, you've gotta read the Talisman first (GREAT book) and then you can read this. Also, reading the Gunslinger series is a recommendation because they are ALL tied in which is a nice thing.They will eventually make this a mini-series as I hear they are doing with Talisman. I just hope they get a great actor for Wolf."
1,Tedious,"It doesn't help that I find Peter Straub's writing style boring and I think Stephen King hurts himself cowriting a book with this person.The only thing this book did for me was put me to sleep. It didn't make sense, didn't have a glimmer of reality in it, and it most certainly did not scare me.Stephen King is best at taking ordinary, every day events and turning them into something really twisted and scary like Needful Things and The Shining - his early writings.Don't waste your time with this book - take a look at Clive Barker's books instead.A disappointed reader."
1,Ouch what a stinker!,"If you want a realy great book read the Talisman or reread it but don't waste your time or money on Black House. I was amazed that the same authors wrote this book. The plot staggered along and one of the best characters from the Talisman ""Parkus"" now becomes just another gunslinger character from the Dark Tower series. I was sooooo disapointed in this book!"
3,Feels like I've been down this road before...,"Having been a big fan of King's work since 1975, I found 'Black House' to be predictable. It took me a while to warm up to it. Although it doesn't make the top ten of my favorite King books, I enjoyed it nonetheless. I still feel that 'The Talisman' was a better overall book. This story was more representative of the Dark Tower series than it was the Talisman, and it even had a Tolkeinish feeling to it towards the end.If you are a true King fan you will enjoy the book. But, if you are just getting started with King I think that 'The Stand' and 'It' are a better bang for the buck."
3,"Okay, but nothing special","The first book, The Talisman, was a joy to read. You couldn't wait to turn the page to see what happened next, but you also didn't want to finish it because then it would be over. Everyone feels that way about books they love. I knew the sequel wouldn't be anywhere nearly as good, and it wasn't. There was no joy in reading it, but only curiosity to see what they were going to do with (and to) the characters. I had never cried before just from reading a book, but I did when Wolf died in the first book. This one doesn't elicit anywhere near the same kind of emotion.Still, it was somewhat entertaining, and it was interesting how it was linked to other Stephen King books. If it wouldn't have been for that link, someone would have had to convince me that Black House was written by the same people, because the writing style is so dissimilar. Not a bad read, but not a great one, either."
2,Not one of his finest...,"I have been reading Stephen King since I was a little kid, and have been really disappointed in his writing lately. However, when I saw Black House, I was intrigued.I became wrapped up in the story almost immediately. I fell in love with the vibrant characters and the unique narrative approach. Then I reached the final section of the book, and was soooo disappointed. The ending felt as if the authors were bored with the book and just wanted to finish writing it already. I felt cheated!The book was off to a great start, and is worth a read if you have already read other books in the series. Just be warned- the ending will leave you disappointed."
2,Disappointing,"When I discovered that there was a sequel to the Talisman, I was so excited. Talisman was a classic with me.Mr. King has drawn yet another of his creations into the Wizard series. Now, although I have read and enjoyed 'Dark Tower', I don't want everything to relate. A lot of my disappointment stems from this.I also found that the comments directly to the reader were disruptive and unnecessary."
3,Letter from the Dear Constant Reader,"Dear Mr. King,I'm following your work from the first book you've published and it is awhile since I realized that you're actually just preparing to write one book - the book about your childhood. You almost skipped that part in autobiography On Writing and you were once almost there with Hearts in Atlantis - but you backed out (writing about the childhood of the hero in 3rd person and about his high school years in first?) Now you're loosing yourself in scattered parts of the Dark Tower and in the end it all comes down to freeing the suffering children out of dark jails bellow the ground like in this novel?I still haven't lost hope for THE book about your childhood but we're not getting any younger. So long live the King!Your dear constant reader"
4,Jack Sawyer returns to the Territories,"It's been about 20 years since I read (and thoroughly enjoyed) ""The Talisman"", and I always wished that the authors would do a sequel. Now my wish has been granted (sort of), and I have enjoyed this new book by two well-known authors of the genre. The story line is quite well done, and the characters, even the relatively minor ones, are well drawn. The plot, once it gets into gear, moves along briskly, and you get caught up in the excitement of it all. Once again, we see a connection between this book and Mr. King's Dark Tower series, and at least he keeps the plot lines consistent. My only complaint about this book (and it's a big one) is that it's just too darn wordy! An editor with some clout could have seriously reduced the size of this book without compromising the story in any way. Sometimes less is more, and that would apply to this book."
1,Intollerable,"Ten minutes into this book I had to check to be sure that I was actually reading the sequel to The Talisman. Granted, this book was not intended to be a smooth continuation over from the Talisman but the writing style even changed. The 'guided tour' styling that is used throughout the book is absolutely maddening. I can't stand it and to make me even more frustrated I cannot understand why they would completely change writing styles from one book to the next when it's THE SAME SERIES.A slow start combined a horrid writing style brew up a very bad novel. As hard as I tried, I could not finish this book. Even if you've read the Talisman, I suggest you point your spending money at a more worthy novel! Black House is garbage."
2,A big disappointment,"Not only was the experimental narrative style a challenge to embrace, but the book was long-winded and bogged down in detail. I loved the Talisman, but Black House just does not measure up as a sequel."
2,Not greatest.,"Disappointed. Interesting bad guy(s), ghoulish demons. Ending was a bit if a let down. Glad for happy ending, as always."
3,"Readable, but not nearly as good as the Talisman","I would like to say that I found The Black House to be somewhat dissapointing. It did not nearly involve the territories enough and I liked jack better as a boy. However, I liked how King tied in his other stories to the book such as The Dark Tower. I found that to be a very interesting angle. Characters such as Beezer, Doc, and Speedy were well done in this book. I would say read it because of the Talisman and wanting closure, but that is about it."
3,"Not a bad story, just not what I expected","I picked up Black House thinking that it was going to be a lot like The Talisman, and I was somewhat disappointed that it was so different. I enjoyed the story line about the killer, the fisherman, and I thought that the idea of Jack being a Police Officer was a good one, I just wish that more time were spent in the territories.All in all, if you like Stephen King, then this might work for you, just don't expect a story like the Talisman."
5,Sequel to Talisman...,"If you enjoyed the Talisman, of course you need to read Black House. If you have NOT read the Talisman, I suggest you do so before Black House. A slight departure for King, it has a unique style that may be the Peter Straub influence. (Koko and Ghost Story are highly suggested reads by Mr. Straub) This book (House) has ties to the Dark Tower series. Different and well scribed this book is 'another' must read for King fans and detractors alike."
5,just as good as the talisman,I enjoyed reading this book alot.Jack is one of my faveorite characters.I just love how King ties in his dark tower series to almost all of his books.King is a masterful story tell and this is one awsome book
4,As good as The Talisman.,"I finished this book last night and I must say, it was very good. I liked it every bit as good as the first entry, The Talisman. I say again: Stephen King and Peter Straub work together with very good results. I recommend this along with The Talisman to all fans of Stephen King and Peter Straub.P.S. I suggest you stop at page 639 (this paperback edition has 659 pages) in the book and draw your own conclusions about what happens next. The last 20 pages are really not worth reading."
2,tough going,"I just started this book. I've read the first few chapters, and I'm finding it tough going. The narrator, an omnipresent we, is obtrusive and offputting. There's too much description, and too little action. The main character has yet to be introduced.I'll try reading a few more chapters, but I don't expect a Steven King/Peter Straub novel to be something you have to struggle through. The best part of reading Steven King (normally) is how he immediately and effortlessly focuses your attention and gets you engrossed in the story."
2,Certainly not King's best work,"After reading The Talisman and Black House, the only obvious conclusion is that the King/Straub collaboration is not a particularly effective one. Neither book grabs the imagination; both are tedious and overly drawn out. The narrative style of Black House is particularly annoying and constitutes the book's major weakness. I can't recall another King work that uses it (thankfully). Severe editing would have made this a much better read. The first third of the book is almost unreadable; however, the last 150 pages or so are much more enjoyable and offer an interesting glimpse into the Dark Tower's Territories. Your reading time would be better spent elsewhere unless you are a big fan of the Dark Tower series and must read every available word about it."
1,A COMPLETE LET-DOWN,"I'm sorry, but Stephen King lost me.( I never realy carred for Mr.Straub's writing..)I live in Holland and for some reason his latest book; "" From a buick 8 "" was published here first...Such garbage!!!!!!It looked like he had some notes laying around from the time he wrote Christine...plain awfull!!But anyhoe, I picked up this book and after 50 pages I had enough.I like to be drawn into a book and not read some dry comments about where we're going and how the curtains look.I know a thing or two about writing but enough with setting the scene allready!!!No, I think I'll even pass on everythings eventually.No more King for me alas."
1,Bid Disappointment,"- Easily the worst book ever to carry the name of Stephen King. What was he thinking, I wonder? Fulfill a contractual obligation, perhaps?- Shallow, flimsy plot, characters you just can't care about, no real element of horror whatever, and an ending not even good enough for a comic book!- Skip this book - it isn't up to snuff and it isn't worth your time."
1,The Black House,"I can't remeber the last time I was so disappointed in a book. It is long winded and down right boring. The freakish float- around-and-look-at-everything style makes it very dificult to get into the story as does the constant introduction of characters that have no bearing on the plot. It is a waste of time and money and I considered it to be a very poor sequel to a great book, The Talisman."
2,Two mediocrities better than one?,"Well,the King of schlock is back for another installment of self-repetition and lame references to his other books.The ever so boring Peter Straub(except for Ghost Story)is on board for this not so thrilling thriller.I guess King is doing the old boy a favor.Short but sweet:King is totally out of ideas.Nothing he has written in the last 5 or 6 years has the least spark of originality.He is now on autopilot,relentlessly pursuing more royalty checks while regurgitating by bits and pieces every book he has ever written.I've read every book of Stephen King,but this piece of garbage is the final insult."
2,Black House,"I loved the Talisman! It is in my top 5 of all books. The Black House was a typical Stephen King book..I'm surprised that Peter Straub even put his name to it. The only redeming part was that it did add some explanation of the Dark Tower Series, but it still wasn't enough. Read at your own risk."
2,In Need of a Good Editor!,"I've been an avid Stephen King and Peter Straub fan since I was in junior high. As a huge fan of The Talisman and The Dark Tower series, I was hugely disappointed Black House.The beginning of the booked is plaged by boring descriptions of the of the town of Parrish Landing. The use of a ""floating camera in the sky"" technique did more to irritate me, than enrich the experience. The editor of this book should have red-inked the first 300 pages of this novel!About half-way through the novel, the authors begin tying in the Gunslinger Series to the territories of The Talisman. For those of you who have been eagerly awaiting closure after The Wizard and the Glass, prepare yourself for disappointment. These two story lines do not jive well together.If you don't have the patience of Job, leave this book on the shelf."
4,Worth the wait,"I have been waiting for a sequel to ""The Talisman"" for years. It was worth the wait. If you have not read ""The Talisman"", read it before you read ""Black House"". The characters in ""Black House"" are richly developed, the narrative-though a bit daunting at times-is fast paced and wonderfully descriptive. This book is a treat for all King fans, reading more like his older works than his newer. I thought the ending was a bit contrived, hence the 4 stars instead of 5."
4,Black House Another Book Fit For A King,"I was very pleased with Black House, although I really dont think it seemed like a sequel to The Talisman. The territories only made brief appearances throughout the book. Still, it was a great story all the same. Henry Layden has to be one of King's most memorable characters and thats why I was surprised..oh Ill give it away, sorry. Come to think of it, there are many surprises in Black House. Dont listen to all those other know it all reviewers who dissed the book. I think any Stephen King fan will enjoy it. Its quite a comeback from the disastrous Dreamcatcher."
2,If you thought this was about the Black Hotel....it isn't...,"I remain firm that Talisman (prequel to this book) can and actually does stand on it's own. But Black House would be a dismal failure without the Talisman.I began this tale and immediately realized I had to read the Talisman first to get the most out of this book.There is one saving grace (actually two) for this book and if you are reading instead of listening, I honestly would chuck the written version and grab the unabridged audio. Frank Muller is a GENIUS - pure and simple. His character's voices are clear and distinct. Muller is what makes this book. Period.I had hoped that the black house was somehow tied to the black hotel in the Talisman, but alas, no. The second saving grace -- the times when we do get to return to the 'other world,' the Territories. Both King and Straub seem to be most comfortable there as well."
1,Black House is blah,"AW steve and pete, I so loved talisman I read it four times. Looked forwardto this but what a disappointment. No point to it unless you guys weregetting back at your Hollywood hatees. I think this book should be calledthe novel that should never have been written and didn't know when toend. No at all scary, no subtley, no moral nothing. come on guys, you knowyou could do better. you have. You guys are a couple of MY authors,please entertain me again."
5,Perfect companion to the Dark Tower series,"Not only is it a good companion to the Dark Tower Series, it's also a great sequal. Not only do you not have to read the Talisman the first book, or the Dark Tower book, it's a good stand alone book, it helps if you read the Talisman first but i don't have too, i didn't. Later i went back and read it but i read this one first, but i don't know many sequal books that you can read without reading the first. Good read, starts of slow but when things start to happen, you just have to hold on tight."
1,"Disappointed. Not a sequel, more like a companion novel.",This was not at all what I expected. More Dark Towery than The Talisman was. The style is that of the Dark Tower Series also.I own 2 first edition hard cover copies of The Black House. (both given to me as B-Day gifts by friends who know the I am a Constant Reader) but I'd trade them both for a tattered copy of The Talisman!
3,Black House was excellent,"Black House by Steven King was an excellent read. the third person view throughout the novel was difficult to follow at first, but you get used to it.In the peaceful town of French Landing, something has gone horribly wrong. a serial killer is on the loose, and evil lerks behind every corner. Three victims have died to the ""Fisherman"" and how many more are to come?Retired detective Jack Sawyer is summoned to the rescue. Jack has a feeling that this situation has been linked with other worlds. Jack knows he is going to have to face this mess one on one. After getting word of an evil Black House that is supposivly cursed, Jack thinks he found the link. Will Jack Sawyer be able to concor the evilness, or will ""it"" and the Fisherman kill again?"
3,Confused,I haven't finsihed the book but trust me...read the Talisman first. I didn't and i didn't read the Dark Tower series either. I am so confused. I get the story just not the bits about the Dark Tower or the Talismans.
3,Decent but the Talisman is better,"Now "" the black house"" is the sequal to the novel ""talisman"" and now when i 1st read the talisman i was blown away it was an amazing piece of literature and i was excited when i heard there was a sequal Now the black house is decent but far from King's and straub's best it was very hard to make a sequal to such a novel(talisman) and the black house just doesn't live up and its hard to get into but it gets better after the 200th page or so but i think they should have taken a different direction with this one."
3,Too Much,"I haven't read a lot of Stephen King's books, but I have read The Talisman, so I don't know how to compare to his other books. But I thought this was much more crude and disgusting than The Talisman. Being a sequel, I thought it would be closer to the original. It wasn't.Over-all I thought the plot and story-line were good, but I could have done without a lot of the details.I also found it difficult to ""get into"". All the talk of floating around as an observer made it difficult to keep interested. I was about 1/2 way through the book before I was comfortable with being the ""observer.""The double ending was also strange. I assume Mr. King did this to keep the reader unsettled. It worked. Even now when I think about it. I wonder what the ""real"" ending is supposed to be."
4,Black House,"I have been waiting for this book to come out for years. Finally, Jack is back! This book starts out extremely slow, but once it ""picked up"", I had trouble putting it down. I also had a few heart pounding dreams while reading this, which good King books tend to do to people. Buy the book, it is worth the money and don't forget to reread ""The Talisman"" first!"
3,Disappointing and not what I expected,"I did not read the Talisman, and I have not read anything in the Dark Towers series. But, I love Stephen King and always have. I have not read as much of his newer stuff as the older novels, (Cujo, The Stand, etc.), but I was really disappointed with this one, possibly because of the Straub collaberation, who knows?The bottom line is this - it has never taken me this long to read a Stephen King novel, ever. It's not that it's bad, but it doesn't hold my attention very well. It's also a very gory novel, so be prepared for that."
4,"Review of, Black House","For those of us who are ""the constant reader"" which I have, with no justification, been for years, this is certainly a good if not a must and hungry read. But I did not give it a five which I would certainly give to ""Duma Key"" or 5 ++++ to 11/22/63. The first half of this book is a little slow and bogs down in little to much description of relatively minor events, in my simple opinion. The next 25 per cent was better and the last 25 per cent of the book ( can you tell I read it on my Kindle) was the absolute page turner -click turner- that all of who belong to, the constant reader club, jones for the next buzz, seek. The last quarter of the story will give you that after glow and is completely worth it, case closed, game over, zip up your fly. And for those of you who want to know about Jack well there is that too"
2,Black House,"This was my first Stephen King book and I don't think that I would read another one. The 640 page book could have been condensed to about 150 pages. It was so descriptive - that the story/plot gets lost. I thought his books were suppose to be scary and thrilling - but I just wanted to tell him ""WE GET THE POINT, NOW GET ON WITH IT!!"" I guess if I was use to his writing, I would have thought it better; but I like the intense, non-stop thrilling, ""OH MY GOD WHAT WILL HAPPEN NEXT!"" kind of books and Black House was not one of them."
2,I wished for better...,"Maybe I am being a little harsh but I had such high expectations... There was way too much explanation of superfluous situations and people that have little to no impact on the plot. Unfortunately, this will probably be my last King novel. Once a big fan, I now just want him to get over his need to connect his books together (w/the Gunslinger series). Does Straub even get to contribute? King is all that is heard in this book where ""Talisman"" had a more colaborative voice.In addition, I too found the ""love at first sight"" of Jack and Judy unbelievable and unnecessary, unless there was more to the relationship that got axed in the editing. Come on, Travelin Jack and a married mental patient....They have always portrayed Jack as on the straight and narrow having an internal moral compass. Now he is hiding evidence and having an affair. I just did not buy it."
2,Got taken again??,This is not a Stephen King work.The story could be so much better but it's full of wordy crap that is not Mr. Kings style.
5,Little Beat up but so Was Jack,"I take long rides to Upstate NY on alternate weekends and I just got through listening to my favorite book of all time the Talisman and I thought I would follow it up with this. I am so glad I did. And it was in fine shape looks like it was loved and listened to once or twice, but well taken care of!"
5,Black House: Best book I've ever read,"This is the best book I have ever read. I never read the Talisman, but I think I am going to. The thing thats so great about this book is not just the extremely unique and suspenseful plot, but the characters. The characters are each TRULY unique, each with their own thoughts, points of view, and feelings. The end leaves us expecting another sequel (hopefully) which I cannot wait for."
3,I Was Horrified!!!,"This book with a very scary title really really horrified me. I expected a fantasy book, but instead got lots and lots of scary parts about some psycho fisherman. It was a little on the slow side so I had Keynote read it to me for sleepytime and that worked good except for the bloody bits. Very gruesome and scary scary scary too. An average horror novel if you ask me by two above average writers. Microwavable, yeah!!"
1,SO DISAPPOINTING,"The Talisman is one of my top 5 favorite books of all time. I was so jazzed to hear the sequel was coming out. What a piece of drek. This book had absolutely nothing to do with the Talisman. I didn't even finish it actually, before I gave it away. I never would have thought that Straub and King needed money so desperately; to publish something like this."
2,A real boring beginning,I am reading & reading to get over what seemed to be endless story telling without excitement.King should rewrite the part what Straub had written and relaunch a revision.Even die-hard fans of King will loose patience.
1,Unbelievable,"I have read every one of Stephen King's books. This was the only one that I have not read. I have struggled to get to page 105 and I have no clue as to what is going one. The style of Peter Straub stinks. Don't waste your money, you will put this book back on the shelf an never have a clue as to what the story is about. Stephen King has finally written a real clunker. This may be the worst book that I have ever tried to read."
3,This Aint no Talisman.........,"The Talisman was a one of a kind adventure leaving the reader longing for more. This one was an interesting read but it really leaves you hanging around waiting for the Talisman story to continue. It goes into detail with horrific and gory details of crimes against children. This book went more for the shock value than anything else. I am sorry, but I have to call it as I saw it. King is probably my favorite author but......well......"
3,slow read,"i can barely remember ""the talisman"" but this book stands on its own pretty well. it's kind of plodding in some places, as i find straub sometimes is. but it draws some very real characters as king alone and king/straub do. probably a good book for a couple of winter nights shut in."
5,Awesome and captivating,"Ok . . I will admit . . it started out a bit slow . . but once it got rolling I'm having a hard time putting it down, even at work - great plot that keeps you on the edge of your seat . . mixing reality with supernatural . . it's one of those books that just sucks you in and is a total page turner . . just like The Talisman was too . . what's cool is if you know these writers well, you can distinguish which parts of the book are primarily written by which author and I love that . . keeps things very interesting . . it has some gruesomeness to it so it you have a weak stomach it may not be your cup of tea . ."
5,Loved it!,"Any Dark Tower fans out there... This is a must-read. It is simply fabulous. There is darkness but like much of his work, it is tempered by light, and the message of hope and the sense of there being more to life and the universe is compelling and magical."
4,A bit protracted but well written,"I enjoyed the story even though it was a bit wordy. However I think they need technical assistance when it comes to describing firearm. A ""service revolver"" is a Ruger semi-auto? I found the parallel with King's Dark Tower series a good plot line. The descriptions of the Coulee area of western Wisconsin were spot on. One of the authors had to have visited there in person.All in all a very entertaining read."
3,"Closer, but . . .","The Talisman was clearly an early work by these two and Black House started off very strong, evincing more experience. Unfortunately, like its predecessor, it suffers from a weak and somewhat predictable ending. Still, until the last 100 pages, I found the writing highly enjoyable and the story engaging. In particular, Part I of the novel was riveting and far more scary than much of King's most recent work. If, like me, you are interested in the Dark Tower series, it seems clear that this story will tie in to Dark Tower V and therefore I'd try to get to it."
3,"Pretty good, but the Talisman was better...","I have waited for years for a collaboration from these 2 again.....well it was a little disappointing. I expected more magic and less real world horror. The real world is a scary enough place as it is and what they incorporated into this book was serial killer images with very little ""flipping over"" into the parallel universe. Granted, they left the door open for perhaps a 3rd book, but overall I feel that Stephen King is slipping. Peter Straub I don't read much of anyway. But Steve's last few books have been overrated and underread (by me at least). I still have ""DreamCatcher"" on my shelf and I just can't seem to get through it. I remember the days when I would read a Stephen King book from cover to cover, sometimes in one sitting, even if it meant staying up all night like a crackhead..."
2,Surprising disappointment,"I gave up on King when he stopped writing horror a few years ago, but had to pick this one up. The Talisman was one of the best King (/Straub) books, so it seems that a sequel would be a sure hit. Unfortunately, this is not really a sequel to the Talisman. Its more of a horror/mystery story with some talisman references tacked on to the end. It was a good story, but the whole time I kept thinking how much better it could have been (Imagine Jack, Henry and Beezer on a journey through the territories).The first 500 pages could have been a lot shorter, leaving more room for what we really want - Jack in the territories again.I think the high point was the tie-in to the gunslinger series though, wonder how he talked Straub into that?"
2,"Is this suppose to be a screenplay, a spoof or just bad?","I loved Stephen King and never really dug Peter Straub. I wasn't happy with the ""Talisman"" but figured I'd give the new book a shot.I'm up to page 32 and I'm so sick of the narrator having us 'fly' all over the place. I feel like they were writing the screenplay for the movie to save the screenwriter some time. I don't want to fly over scenes in a book. I want to be put squarely into the action and all that zipping around town pulls you of the story. It's not cute or clever, just annoying and distracting.There is one stand out line that I thought said it all:""The black house was pretty bad; in fact, it was terrible, but this...this is going to be worse.""You can't get anymore prophectic then that."
1,ZZZZZ....,"I love King. I really do...but this book is BORING. It takes too long to get to anything remotely interesting. I hated wading through endless pages of descriptions of every leaf on a tree or every house on a block. I really haven't read anything by Straub, but King should know better. FOR SHAME!"
3,BIG DISAPPOINTMENT,"Black House was my 16th King novel and I have read several of Peter Straub's (KOKO being my favorite), but none have been as disappointing as Black House. Of course I read Talisman which I thought was a fantastic, magical read, but the follow-up lacked substance and was bloated with unnecessary description and information, which seems to be King's latest trend. I certainly agree with other reviewers in the fact that we get way too much French Landing and not enough Black House. When we finally encounter the actual Black House, the end of the novel is near and it seems like King and Straub simply wanted to get the story over as quickly as possible. The ending is unimaginative and abrupt considering that it took over 550 pages to get to that moment. For any other writers, this would be a great story, but for King and Straub it is mediocre at best. Want my advise? Stick with the early novels!!!"
3,What a let down!!!,"I had such a hard time getting thru this book!!! I loved the talisman, and I was excited to find out that there was a 2nd book. Black house was such a BORE!!!! I found myself skimming page after page. I cannot stand when an author goes so much into detail that they have to have these 2 page inner monologs(sp)~ Don't get me wrong I love detail but this was way to much.I love the whole ""Territories"" premise. The characters in Black House were not as interesting as in the Talisman... It was good to see ol traveling Jack again, but it was also annoying how long it took him to get involved in helping find the Fisherman.. I think people will be dissapointed with Black house~Eventhough I was dissapointed with Black house I would definetly read any pre-quals or sequals~"
2,What happened?,"I don't pretend to be a book critic, but I was so very disappointed with Black House. I usually finish a SK book in 1 or 2 days - I've been reading this ""horror"" for (gee, scratch scratch) so long I can't even recall when I started it! I actually fell asleep one evening with the book perched on my belly.I didn't like the ""meandering gunk"". The rest wasn't even a horror. It wasn't scarey...just gory (the intestine thing wasn't even worth reading - you knew it was coming). There was a lot written and not much said if you know what I mean - I was three quarters of the way through it and was wondering when something was gonna happen - aside from Ty's kidnapping, and Judy's mental break down, can you think of anything? Oh.. Sophie was a nice .. but again...not enough development here. Everything was just kind of dangly..gearing up for another Jack Sawyer adventure?If you're a SK fan, then you'll have to read it of course. But wait and save some $$ and buy it in paperback."
5,It's Stephen King......... People!!!,"I am amazed that readers review this book with comments such as ""It's too bizarre"" or ""It's too grim"" and ""It's too scary""!Hey, this is Stephen King not Charles Dickens or Dr. Seuss. If you want to be comforted read a cozy love story or a western novel. This book is MEANT to be scary. Its a horror book!I found it an easy read and quite frankly....alot of fun! It's certainly IS creepy and the characters are described with that uncanny realism theat King is so good at. The book illustrates madness and human frailty along with some down right interesting, albeit weird, people.Read the thing and get a little frightened. But lighten up! It's only fiction. ENJOY!"
1,Disappointed,"What utter, pretentious drivel. This book is an insult to The Talisman. I loved that book and really looked forward to the sequel. After 18 years both authors have become long-winded and obviously in love with their own prose. Compare the two books and the difference will be immediately apparent. Over 200 pages in and Jack has finally remembered what came before. I have decided that I don't care how it comes out. I am going to move on to something that is written better and is more enjoyable to read such as one of Phil Rickman's novels."
4,"Finally, after all these years","I read the Talisman one summer many moons ago. I treasured the book and have put it at the top of my list. Enjoyed it so well, that as soon as I finished it, I read it again. Black House was not as well written or as captivating as The Talisman but was very glad to seen a sequel. Even though it was slow at times, I enjoyed reading it. The Characters, such as The Thunder Five and Henry, bring you even closer to the book. If you loved the Talisman, this is a must read but do not expect the same effect that you received from the first book."
3,Mediocre Sequel,"I can not and will not give this book 5 stars just because this is by the infamous Stephen King and Peter Straub. Once again it is a big fat wordy book. It is written from a strange point of view, like you are a bird, flying over a town observing things and going invisibly into open windows of houses. It takes the first 75 pages to get use to this strange stand point. I have no idea why they would choose to write this way because tryng to be ""creative"", actually becomes aggravating.It is good and sick horror stemming once again from the Good versus Evil storyline from the Talisman. Once again we have Travelin Jack as the main character and once again the two authors insist on killing off one of your favorite characters.The ending in the ""Black House"" once agains gets very very bizarre and certainly can not be predictable. I suppose if you have read the Talisman and you have waited this long for the ""god pounding"" sequel....read it."
2,"C. Montgomery Burns, anyone?","As already noted, by far the most interesting character in this novel is the pedophilic, cannabalistic child murderer-taken over by a demon, the elderly Burnside. Unfortunate choice of name, as I kept picturing that bad ol' man of Springfield, C. Monty Burns carrying out the killings (""Chop, chop! Excellent!""). The book also borrows outrageously from both the film EXORCIST III and the novel THE WORLD ACCORDING TO GARP. There are wonderful passages, to be sure, and I actually enjoyed the gimmick of the omniscent, flying narrator. I just didn't think the book, as a whole, ahem, flew."
3,Coulda Been A Contenda,"This could have and should have been a great book. The Talisman concept was great, and King and Straub seem to have recaptured the magic of their early careers. However, this book was prevented from being five stars by a terrible ending and by too much reliance on one's knowledge of King's Dark Tower series, which it is unlikely most mystery lovers, as opposed to pure King lovers, have read. So, I give it five stars for everything up to the ending and 1 star for the ending, averaging out to three. I do hope, however, that the ending at least means we will be seeing more of Jack at some later date. One last thing, though. Since the Territories were involved here, how could there be no wolves, oh, pardon me, wolfs."
3,Who wrote what part of the book???,"I've just finished Black House, and here's what I think: Stephen King wrote at least 90 % of that book!!! I'm sure Peter Straub wrote the very first chapter -- it just doesn't read like Stephen King's masterful prose -- and very few others, but SK did the main job on that novel! To my mind, it's not really a collaboration at all . . . I think SK just wanted to have Peter Straub's name on the cover as well (possibly because The Talisman sported both names on the front), and thus invited him to contribute a few thousand words to this admittedly moderate mystery/fantasy novel.I wonder whether they split the money 50-50 or, more fairly, 90-10. What do you think?"
3,The Talisman it ain't,"Disappointing sequel. Maybe you're damned if you do (stay too closely to the original so you get accused of re-hashing old material) and damned if you don't (stay close enough so that fans of the original will find many of the same things in the sequel that they liked so much about the original). Here, SK is damned 'cause he didn't. This is hardly a sequel at all in the commonly accepted sense. Not much 'travelin', not much territories, not much Speedy, no twinners etc. About the only thing the two books have in common is the name of the protagonist. That being said, it wasn't bad, just disappointing to this reader who counts The Talisman among the best of King's past efforts."
2,Get to the point,"I am ashamed that in my first review, I admitted I didn't finish the book. I felt so bad I went back to it, but unfortunately, I didn't change my mind much on it. It's another overblown, overly long Stephen King novel that should just get to the point. I liked his stories that did this, like ""Thinner"" and ""Christine"", and I have no problem reading very long books. I just wished this one was more focused and to the point."
2,Boring and draw out,"As a huge fan of Stephen King I was giddy to see this audio-book at the library. After listening to two tapes, I am convinced the story is not my cup of tea and seriously lacks any interesting story line. I hope his future books are much better."
4,Psychological expose of a successful man,"Leo Davies epitomises success with his work & in his worldyet he has vulnerability. As this book & as the series of booksabout Leo, progress, he develops a greater understanding ofhimself. Leo started off arrogant but age is humbling him.What will happen to Leo when he gets old?After an initial attempt at custody, he gave his son Oliver to his estranged wife, Rachel. He was forced to do this as hisemotions compromised his judgement. For the first time,Leo failed. Yet Leo has grown emotionally & may for the firsttime start to realise how to find happiness with other people.Caro Fraser has an excellent ability to understand the conflicts& compromises that people make in the fulfilment of their lives.I cannot wait to read what happens to Leo, in her next book."
5,Love it,"I love this book. I find it has many good ideas, plus excellent instructions that are easy to understand and follow. I would buy this again."
5,Great product but won't buy from Amazon at this price,"Hey Amazon, are you listening? The detergent is excellent. I have used Tide for years and they also rate high on Consumer Reports for front loaders. I won't buy it here at that price. As other reviewers have commented, it is way overpriced on Amazon. I can get it a lot cheaper at Walmart or even my local supermarket. Amazon pricing is great on a lot of items. They really missed the boat on this one."
3,TOO Expensive!!,I can buy this locally at the grocery store for $12/bottle. Amazon's price works out to be $17/bottle!!
2,"Quality Product, But Overpriced","High quality product, very efficient detergent, however the price here is $0.27 per load versus WalMart 110 load version at $20.87 which comes out to $.21 per load with tax. Apples to apples, that equates to $13.11 per bottle at WalMart (adjusted to 64 loads), versus $17.28 here. If you are buying 4 bottles, as with this bulk purchase, the cheaper option represents a savings of $16.68 which is well worth the price of a trip to the store."
3,A Little Spillage in the Box,"Tide is a great product as always. When my case arrived, one of the bottles had leaked detergent into the shipping box."
4,Satisfied customer.,I am happy to report that we received all but one case of our Tide and had it shipped super saver.
3,The Tide is Rising on Amazon's Price,"I am a lifeliong devotee of Tide, My mom used it, and 20+ years ago, I started using it. Bar none, there is no other detergent that can hold up to Tide.When I was a struggling student, I bought cheaper detergents -- trying them all. NONE was a workhorse like Tide.I would give Tide 5 stars for delivering it's promises. But am am taking off two serious points for the outrageously high price Amazon is charging for this ( even with the 15% discount). I live in Manhattan where things are super high -- and I can still get this cheaper."
5,Works great in my wash.,This product arrived in great condition and the product itself is very efficient in cleaning my clothes and makes my laundry smell great and the task of doing laundry just a little less troublesome. I love to order this product from Amazon using free shipping. It is a heavy bottle and I don't have to lug it from store to car and car to house. The delivery is to my front door and I can skip the laundry detergent section at the grocery store.
1,Itching like crazy!,"I finally went to my doctor after my skin would not stop itching. It was determined that Tide Acti-lift was the problem. I have NEVER been allergic to any detergent in my life, and used different Tide products before. When I first tried it, I noticed that my laundry room had an almost caustic scent to it. It was incredibly strong (and I only used 2 teaspoons in my HE machine), and burnt my throat. I was then prescribed a cream from the doctor ($50.00!) and had to re-wash ALL my clothes, bedding, everything in baby detergent to get the Tide off. What a pain! Supposedly Tide is notorious for causing allergies. News to me, and I am no longer a Tide user. A friend later told me that her friend's little guy was a very sick boy in the hospital and it was finally determined that he had a severe allergy to Tide. He is all better now. Again, I am happily no longer a Tide user."
1,No value for the money,"I bought this for my 4 year old daughter... One would think that a game for a 4 year old would last longer than 1 hour. She finished it and was ready to put it away forever in less than 1 hour and that included the time to install the software.In short you are better off buying the book for your child because that is really all this is, it reads the story to them and then has 3 of the lamest games that have likely ever been created for a computer. Don't waste your time on this one, save yourself 20 dollars and buy them the book."
4,Not for Win XP/7,"This Green Eggs & Ham is a fun computer story book. My 4 year old grandson enjoyed it very much (I use the read-to-me option).I couldn't get it to work on my XP, nor on my newer Win 7 computer.I had an old Toshiba Win 98 laptop, so I run this storybook off of it. This also gives me more time on my computer.If you only have Win XP, it might run in the compatibility mode for Win 95/98. In my case it did not.If you have Win 7, don't bother."
3,Will not work on newer Macintoshes,"Managed to get this to work on my husband's work computer. Our son absolutely LOVES. Big belly laughs. So disappointed that we cannot get to work on Macintosh running 10.5.5. Wish they would release an update, but the developer does not appear to be supporting any longer. Really too bad."
5,Music with depth,"Never knew Michael Perry had a musical group till recently. Have been devouring all his books. This music is easy to listen to but if you listen a little harder, there is a depth to the lyrics and the music. He has my respect as a musician and as an author."
5,Trance-like music,"I am not a musician. No rational nor much technical knowledge about music...nevertheless my upbringing was always surrounded by all kinds of music, mainly classical; so I respond emotionally to music. Dirk Serries' (a.k.a. vidna obmana)record is an intense piece for those who like trance-like music and for those who listen music for other reasons (meditation, healing,etc.). The reberberant sax and flute contributions by two Italian musicians make the piece haunting and kind of a new style for Mr. Serries. Good to listen near or thinking about a majestic landscape...or simply at home."
3,Better packaging than content,This book was exciting in places but disappointing overall. It's packaged to seem really cool but it's more about biblical history and research than it is about Indiana Jones-type adventures.
5,Ark Fever,"I've read all of Bob's books and this one is definitley a thrilling adventure from cover to cover. Once you start reading Ark Fever, you won't want to put it down!-Beth J. Lueders, author and speaker"
2,"Interesting, but not worth 225 pages.","Bottom line, the subject matter is very interesting, and Bob Cornuke's role in the quest for the Ark is worth reading about, but this book should have been 25 pages, not 225.Unless you're truly interested in an adventure story about every detail of every expedition, you'll agree. It's like he, when writing the book, struggled to come up with things to say to make the book long enough. I would not recommend the book; I'd recommend that someone who's interested visit the Web site for 20 minutes and call it good."
2,Nice But Not As Expected,"These baked custard cups , in the classic ribbed design and size we all know and love from Grandma's day, also make delicious high and light popovers. But alas, the rims are about as thin as stoneware teacups, not the traditional thick-walled ones that resist breakage (as shown)."
3,bottoms not flat,"Prefer a flat bottom for creme brulee. This is tapered and rounded at bottom. If you like the shape, the product is good."
5,useful small storage containers,nice lip on top to help opening container. Perfect size for small amounts of leftovers. Good for lunch.
4,Pashmina shawl,"While I doubt that this shawl is truly of the kind valued over $100 , I thought it was worth $20. It is very soft , feels nice on your shoulders and is the perfect weight for a summer evening. The huge variety of colors available and reasonable price make it possible to own several to match different outfits. It would make a nice gift also."
4,Very Interesting,"A lovely production of Rameau's opera-ballet. The form is set of essentially independent scenes united by a common theme, in this case the triumph of love. Rameau and his librettist capitalized on the Enlightenment fascination with exotic cultures, setting the stories in Ottoman Turkey, Inca Peru, Persia, and North America. To be sure, these are highly Europeanized versions of the settings. Much lovely music performed beautifully by the remarkable William Christie and Les Arts Florissants."
1,DONT EVEN THINK ABOUT BUYING THIS ALBUM!!!!!!,"This ablum was produced by Gull records, a company Judas Priest hasn't worked with for decades and thier just trying to cash in on the Judas Priest name. If you buy this ablum you do not deseve to be called a Judas Priest fan. Be supportive and by the real records."
3,Compilation of first two records,"This is really a compilation of songs from Judas Priest's first two records - 'Rocka Rolla' (1974) and 'Sad Wings of Destiny' (1976) - released pre-major label debut. Whether it is really the best of these offerings is debatable. However, what is notable is the inclusion of ""Diamonds and Rust"", which did not appear on these two records and is a better studio version than what would later appear on 'Sin After Sin' (1977).The interviews included at the end are interesting, even though they have been disavowed as rubbish by the current incarnation of Judas Priest."
1,Very poor job on Important Topic,"This book is full of appeal to authority fallacies, cliches, anecdotes and references to articles in newspapers which is sad state of affairs considering that one of the authors is a Ph.D. The ""used"" price for this book is in the basement for a reason. This may entertain a first year student at a low level college somewhere or a high level high school student but it's really unfortunate that this subject was treated in such a sloppy manner."
3,"Heavy topics, people with real and real big problems, difficult to read",This is third part of Valis trilogy and something not so readable as 'Divine Invasion' and waaay too heavier and less SF than 'Valis'. I didn't expect PKD novel to be so realistic and far from SF. That's why I got disappointed a little I guess.
3,Bizarre,"Not for the easily offended Christian.It's an engaging read, though at times it bogs down in its psychological ramblings. Like VALIS & The Divine Invasion, this book examines what we consider to be reality. Radio Free Albumuth is a better examination of the same topic."
3,Bishop Pike revisted,"An interesting book that seems to follow the career of Episcopalian Bishop Pike but throws in a bit of the paranormal before it was popular to do so. Philip K Dick's writing has some fascination to it, but this isn't his best novel. Nevertheless, if you're a fan you shouldn't miss it."
3,Very Personal Book,"Dick herein reflects, in fictional account, on his relationship with Bishop James Pike and some mutual friends. It's very personal and probably of limited interest to those unfamiliar with Pike or Dick's lives. But I will say that Dick does communicate a certain essence of his Christian-inflected beliefs and philosophy during the course of the book.It's not science fiction, and it's not really part of any VALIS trilogy."
2,Difficult,"I found this book very difficult to read. I have read Androids, Valis, Divine Invasion and assorted short stories before cracking this one. I found it very depressing to read, and I found myself wondering if Dick did indeed write the book.I am going to set it down for some time. Too much discussion of suicide, death, death of faith, etc."
5,My First Phillip K. Dick Novel,"I got interested in this Author after seeing the film Through A Scanner Darkly. This isn't so much science fiction as it is a feast of ideas. I like that it's in first person and that the main character is a woman. I found the writing very masterful. Also, being a sort of biblical history buff, found the subject matter very intriguing. I'm definitely going to check out his other titles."
2,Silently so-so,"Not so impressed after using it to strip old millwork with intricate detail. It worked great on flat areas, but did more harm than good on the details - paint was hard to remove from crevices, and then would dry hard and crusty and uneven as soon as you remove the heat to use both hands to get into the details, and made sanding even more difficult than if i had just left it alone. When I tried to go back and re-work an area, the exposed wood burned because there was no longer an even coat of paint to protect it from the heat. Some of the detailing I was removing paint from turned out not to be wood, and created damage by melting it. Gets really heavy to hold too, and hot! So hot in fact that it cracked a mirror. If I had to do it again, would use a non-toxic chemical based stripper instead."
1,Customer service is awful,"I needed a part to fix the Silent Heater. I have been using it for two years and one of the wires broke. I called to get the replacement part and and they were not helpful. I had questions to ask and they continued to refer me to a set they said I needed to purchase for 50.00. I tried to get some clarification to no avail. The product works well when it works. I have had to replace the bulbs twice in two years. The bulbs are spendy. Now I have an electrical problem. This delays my ability to complete my project. I wish they were more customer friendly, rather than to try to take my money."
3,A bit klunky for individual user,"It's effective but not flexible. Yes, it does work as advertised. However, you have to scrape by hand anyhow to get near the edges of the trim etc. Very expensive for a job that I can do with a heat gun and a good scraper. I could see it being useful for a large house that you're restoring."
2,Disappointing,"I looked forward to reading The Mystery of Aleph (interesting subject, interesting people), and was disappointed for three reasons. First, it is disjointed, with each story or miniature biography interrupted by another story. Second, the book builds up Cantor as a protagonist, but then does not build his story to any climax or resolution. (I do not expect people's lives to follow literary conventions, but I do expect books to do so.) Finally, the explanation of the mathematics of infinity is very vague: it is neither mathematical enough to follow as math, nor non-mathematical enough to serve as a purely lay explanation. (The same is true of the explanations of Kabalah, which contain just enough information to be frustrating.)"
1,Aczel's books are disappointing,"Aczel has gotten a lot of press, so I read two of his books to evaluate whether to recommend them to my students. I do not recommend his work to anyone. His topics are interesting and important, but his treatment is very disappointing. Light and fluffy writing can help ease laypeople into reading science, if it is organized and accurate. Aczel's is not. He wanders among ideas without developing them in enough depth to appreciate. He poses interesting questions as if he intends to answer them, but does not.Read Simon Singh or Timothy Ferris instead. Just as easy to read, and far more coherent and satisfying."
4,Interesting Book on Mathematics and a Mathematician,"Aczel offers an interesting book on Georg Cantor, the ""father"" of set theory (a branch of mathematics). The book covers a number of interesting topics, including a unique overview of infinity, a description of the inception of a new branch of mathematics and a mini-biography of Georg Cantor.I recommend this book to readers interested in mathematics and mathematicians."
4,Complex concepts explanied in simple language,I am not a reader. I started reading with this book. One might think I was crazy to start with this level of analytical complexity. I must admit I thoroughly enjoyed it. I plan to read more by Dr Aczel. I would highly recommend it to readers with an analytical mind and a deep interest in mathematics. This book is not on pure mathematics. It goes into explaining the evolution of the concepts of infinity throughout history.
2,Disappointed,"This item is very difficult for one person to use with a kayak. The configuration & length of the ""leg"" does not serve any purpose when loading....It requires a very strong person or two people to properly load a kayak. It works well once it's loaded."
1,Seller should be ashamed,"A trip to the dumpster with this one and a purchase from a competitor fixed all problems.Problems were same as many others found -1. comes with cable that prevents the carrier from opening, instructions don't even mention the cable or how to route.2. webstrap across middle is too short to allow carrier to accomodate kayak.3. kickstand is too short, carrier is tilted too far and falls over when using kickstand.4. foam pads are poor quality, don't roll to assist in loading kayak.The metal tubing, useless cable, and too short webstrap appear to be the only components with any quality, just don't work."
5,Inexpensive and effective,"Essentially no assembly required and worked ""right out of the box"". The wheels roll nicely making moving my kayak to the water's edge simple and easy."
3,kayak cart,the cart is sturdy in construction and looks good. The only drawback is the kickstand. it is short so it does not let the cart remain level but tilted about 30 degree forward (down). other then that it is a good kayak cart.
3,what a smell,This carrier works very well as long as you strap the boat tightly. Good price and fast shipment from Amazon.com. Everything seems good except there is a very strong hospital sanitizer smell that could fill your whole house. I think the smell is from the tires. But it was so strong that it took a couple of months to go away. So I took two stars off from my rating due to the smell.
1,canoe carrier,"this carrier is a real piece of garbage. the tires came uninflated and very difficult to inflate. and i will be curious if they stay inflated, stay away from this item."
4,Good carrier for most types of kayaks.,"Easy to assemble, solid made, moves most kayaks around as i had hoped. Good price, we are glad we purchased it. Straps included for securing kayak to carrier could be better designed for convenience is only complaint."
4,Good Deal for the Money,"I purchased this cart to carry my canoe and kayaks. Great deal for the money. Pretty easy to assemble. Works great. We'll see how it holds up. I compared it to other similar carts, and it was the best price. It does take a while for the rubber smell from the tires to dissipate. If you leave it in the car, it will stink for days!"
1,no es igual al de la foto,"el articulo llego y no trae la pieza con la que se sostiene, y llego a mi paiz sellado y no fue violentado pero no esta completo o no es igual al de la imagen con la que nos venden"
3,cable routing wrong,"When I received the product it was obvious the cable routing was wrong. There are no clear pictures of the cable routing and attachment and no mention of a cable in the supplied assembly,operating and safety instructions. I emailed Pacific-Cycle customer service and attached pictures. They acknowledged the cable was wrong but their reply as to how it should be routed was jibberish.The box it was shipped in was torn and damaged but luckily all the parts were still in the box."
4,quality control needed,"Product was shipped in a badly broken box with parts missing. Ultimately (and willingly)resolved by Amazon and Pacific Outdoors, but it would have been nice for them to do it right the first time. Also, the addition of a cable, which I suspect was motivated by the fabric strap not being sturdy enough, is not represented in the pictures of the product."
3,Somewhat dissapointing,"First thing, when I bought the book the edition was said to be, on the Amazon[.com] web site, Hardcover when it really was Paperback. Secondly, it was promoted elsewhere as ""catalogue raisonné"" when it does NOT include any comments on the paintings. Just as well the paintings are worth it by themselves..."
5,Excellent resource and reference,This is a must for any organization that is in the business of providing mental health services. It is the bible of clinical measures.
5,soon to be mom,"I went to Babies R Us and looked at all the cribs and I really liked this one. I like the look of the antique walnut finish, and the style. It is really sturdy and doesn't shake when pressing on it like a lot of cribs do. It is high quality for a affordable price. We bought it and it had all the parts and is in excellent condition. My husband had no trouble putting it together. It looks great in our nursery and we are very satisfied. It is harder finding wood furniture that matches the finish but the workers at Babies R Us say that some will be available but is a new line of furniture so it hasn't arrived yet."
1,Capri Lifetime Crib in WHITE,"I bought the crib with a white finish at Babies R Us. The white finish has a noxious odor similar to gas and mothballs combined. The smell permeated not only the nursery, but a sizeable area of my entire home. I returned the crib thinking that maybe the manufacturer had inadvertantly missed a step of the finishing process. I exchanged it for another of the same model and color crib. It had the same odor- luckily I checked it before we left the store. Apparently all of the white finish cribs had the same problem and others had been returned with the same complaint. Ultimately, because I needed a white crib, I had to purchase a different model.The maple finish was fine- it is only the white finish that had the odor."
1,TOXIC FUMES!!!,"I purchased a white Capri Lifetime Crib. When we set it up we smelled a bad odor but thought it might go away. We left the window open and washed it with soap and water. It just got worse. It is not only a bad smell but fumes that burn your eyes and if you stay in the room for a while, you feel like you can't breathe normally. It is the same way you might feel while cleaning the bathtub with a bleach product without proper ventilation. It has now been 12 days and the fumes are just as bad as day one. While reading the reviews on Babies-R-Us I found that 2 other people experienced the same problem and that it was only the white cribs. This crib should not be used near a baby since it causes breathing problems and eye irritation. I feel that it should be recalled. I will certainly be taking mine back. It really is a shame because the crib is beautiful. I hope the cherry finish ones do not have this problem."
2,"nice idea, but it was broken","Out of the hundreds of items I've purchased through Amazon from books to kitchen appliances, this is the very first thing I've returned. The chair looked great coming out of the box (and it should, being an $80 lawn chair!). Once I opened it up, I discovered the pivotal point where the bottom back of the seat joined the legs was held together by a tiny rivet-like fastener that was broken. The rest of the chair seemed to be made very sturdy, which made me scratch my head as to why the one critical moving part in the whole construction was an obvious cheap piece of metal that apparently broke in shipment. I was really dissapointed with the product, but very satisfied with how easy it was to return it and get a refund. Thank you Amazon, for being so easy to deal with!"
4,sturdy chair,"I really like this chair. It is comfortable and fairly durable. I only have two complaints. The bolts holding the chair together tend to fall off if not tightened every once in a while. Also, I am 6'4'' and the chair is a little bit too short for me. Otherwise, this is the perfect chair for it's price.Update: after a couple of months of use, another bolt fell off and the mesh is ripping. I am not sure how much longer it will hold up. Maybe I am too heavy for the chair (250 lbs.)."
1,LOW Quality,"I bought this movie for my daughter having watched it extensively as a child myself. I found that I could barely watch this video. I am surprised that Amazon is even selling this item based on the fact that the quality is that of a poorly pirated copy. I could have my old VHS copy restored to higher quality than this. If the description of the product was properly explained, I would have spent more money on a better quality edition. All in all, I guess that's what you should expect for a $6 ""DVD""."
2,"no ""quack quack"" song on this version","if you're looking to sing along with all the songs you loved in this movie, buy a different version--this one's edited. i got the whole way through it and thought, ""i wonder when they'll sing 'the quack quack song'""? lo and behold, it's not on here. glad i only spent a dollar (i bought it analog). caveat emptor!"
1,My car throws a diagnostic trouble code with this sensor,"Although Bosch says it is compatible with my car (1996 Toyota Land Cruiser) for the upstream oxygen sensor, my car throws a P0135 error code, which means the current draw of the heater is either too much or too little. The resistance of the heater is 3.8 ohms, but in the specs for my car, it says resistance must be 11-16 ohms. So it draws too much current. Either the oxygen sensor is broken or it's not built to specification. Either way, this sensor does not work for my car. I've called their warranty service line which is a recording, and haven't heard back from them.Other than that, the part looks and feels sturdy and fit perfectly. However the smartlink connector was a pain to set up, it took a few hours.If I had to do it all over I would probably by an OE style oxygen sensor not from Bosch."
3,You don't want to meet me in a dark alley!,"Seriously! You don't want to meet me in a dark alley, extra-specially if I have my Krav Maga: The best defense book with me. The book is your standard step by step how to book, you get what you put into it. Practice = Time, Time, I don't have much of, maybe you do?"
4,Great gift for children that want to know how things work,"I purchased the original big big loader for my 2 year old son, and he has been fascinated by the way it works. He watches as the equipment moves from location to location, to figure out how everything works. He often turns off the toy and hauls and dumps the ""rocks"" himself. The elevator and lift are especially fascinating. While his is the construction version of the big big loader, he saw the ""choo choo"" on line and really wants this one too. It is somewhat fragile, and the interaction is limited. But he comes back to this toy again and again. The extra piece of track connects this product to the ""big loader"" which I recently purchased for my son as well. You can use just one of the motorized bases, and save the other for when the first wears out."
3,"Repetitious, loud and frustrating","My 2 1/2 yr old got this as a gift since he loves anything train (especially Thomas and friends) and it's been quite disappointing. If you are thinking of getting this for your own child, don't! If you are getting it as a gift, don't, unless you don't like the child's parents! This is a LOUD toy. And repetitious. The toy does everything by itself, after an adult has spent upward of 1/2 hour assembling it, and cannot be reconfigured into any other shape. My son still likes playing with it but that also includes taking the whole thing apart, letting the train run somewhere, anywhere and losing the balls. After the initial ""cute"" this toy just becomes very frustrating and definitely not worth the money.Get another Thomas train with wooden tracks for a lot more fun and educational value."
3,Fun but Frustrating,"My 3rd year old received this as a gift -- He loved the action, but was not content to just watch, wanted to move the chassis vehicle often. Unless you position the vehicle correctly, it will not operate.... Also, my little engineer loved to disassemble the entire track... A nightmare for mom to reassemble (make a copy of the assembly instructions and keep them somewhere handy.) Also! the chassis truck 'runs' whether on the track or not; hence the instructions warning about not getting it close to hair, etc.... I once found ours running in his closet, caught on carpet and making an oily mess.....The toy is fun, but frustrating."
2,no fun to just watch,"I bought the other loader set for my 4yr old grandson. The problem with these toys is that the child can only watch it run. There is no interaction. And the vehicles all operate with the same motion unit, so the child cannot play with the toy at all."
2,Best for dads not kids,"Setting this up was not as difficult as others have made it seem. However, once set up, you just watch it. There is no interaction. In fact, my 5 year old wants to play with it and touch things, which just causes it not to work until I fix it back the way it was.As an engineer, I think I bought this more for myself. It is facinating to watch and see how everything works. Some people had a lot of fun designing this toy. Now I want the big loader to hook up so I have the big big big loader set."
2,Disappointed with Thomas Big Big Loader,"This toy was very difficult to put together, was confusing to use, plus the elevator did not work at all. It was recommended for children 3 years and older, but even two adults had a hard time with the toy."
3,Ugh!!!,"We bought this for our 3 year old. After spending close to an hour setting up, he couldn't even play with it! It does everything by itself. So, Cranky was taken off to play with.. very disappointed! But Dad enjoys watching the monotony of the train set (around, and around)"
3,"FUN, BUT YOU BETTER BE PREPARED......","Its more of a ""setup and look at "" instead of a play with me toy. My son wanted to help thomas, and once you set this thing up, there isn't a lot for them to do, and they quickly lose interest. I have held onto it, as it may be something to mount on a board, and show off later in life, but for now, its packed away, with the instructions (and God help you if you lose them!). If your child has a short attention span, just buy them something they can play with. This wasn't worth the price we paid."
3,A fun pain!,"I'm so glad I found this online...we've been trying to figure out how to put it back together again as it's been in the loft for a year! I've been looking for a picture so we can get it just right (it won't run otherwise!)It's SUCH a pain to put together & you canNOT touch it once it's going, but once it gets started, the boys just love watching it! It's not hands-on, as someone else said, but they (6.5 & 5yrs old) still get a kick out of it anyway!"
2,"it depends on the kid, but...","For my 4-year old son, this set was a disappointment. He spent his own birthday money that he received from his grandmother on it, and perhaps learned the lesson that the flashiest toys are not necessarily the most fun. The set up is not easy - daunting even for an adult (hint - make sure that the ramps for Thomas and the Lorry are correct - they look the same, but small difference will prevent the set from working if you get them mixed up). Once it was working, it was fascinating. . . for about 15 minutes. Then he wanted to play with it, but even the smallest jolt throws it off. The kids that would most enjoy it, I think, are younger than the 3-5 recommended range, but because of choking hazard, they are not suppose to use it. Overall, a disappointment - money would be better spent on other Thomas gear."
1,Disappointed,"Seeing my son's favorite characters, Thomas and Cranky the Crane had me excited when he received this as a gift. He is really into cranes and loading things, etc. It was a real disappointment to see that this toy offers no play value whatsoever. All children can do is watch it move. Although, my 2 1/2 year old, valiantly tries to play with it and make it do what he wants. Of course this means that it easily comes apart and it is frustrating since the vehicles do not move manually.The assembly instructions are not clear (I still have an extra piece of track which serves no purpose that I can tell), and once assembed the toy is very sensitive to movement.Although it is fun for children to watch for a short time they easily get bored. I would not recommend this toy to anyone."
4,Not worth the money,"I bought this for my 3 yo son suspecting that it wouldn't hold up, and it didn't. It comes with 10 little balls, of which 6 went missing the first day. Although it's fascinating to watch how the vehicles move the balls around the track, and is something of an engineering feat, it was difficult to put together, came with virtually no instructions on how to work it, and one tiny plastic protrusion broken off Lorry #1 has now rendered it useless.I have searched the net looking for replacement balls and a replacement Lorry #1, to no avail. It's a fun toy, but if you buy it, think of it as a week or two's worth of entertainment, not as a toy that can be passed down."
3,fun for the eyes!,"This toy was a gift to my boys ages 6 and 4. The toy needed adult assembling, and was fun to watch several times. The durability is not great, as each time someone banged or touched it, it would fall apart. Also, there is no interaction or active involvement for the child."
3,Danger undoing wrong side of chassis!,"Ok, so I didn't read the instructions, but when the motorised chassis ran out of battery power I picked it up the wrong way, undid the 3 retaining screws and PTOWINNNG.... gear parts fell out all over my lap. There was no way I could put them all back.The battery compartment is the other side, but there was nothing stopping someone with an ordinary screwdriver opening it up the wrong way and permanently destroying the thing.Why couldn't the manufacurers either SEAL the side not meant for opening or use those special / triangle head screws so the average 'Joe' realises it's not for mere mortals to open that side.BE WARNED.PS That being said, the local support centre were very helpful in sending me a new one."
1,BIG BIG...Pain,"It takes a lot to frustrate me or my child but this toy did it pretty easily. The toy is not hands on (try to tell that to a 3 yr old). As soon as you touch it it falls apart. Some of the parts don't fit snuggly , so they constantly have to be adjusted. It has a strong motor, so when it derails(pretty often) it falls apart. Would not recomend at all. Tomy has another toy "" THE BIG BIG BIG loader"" same idea bigger pain."
4,Pretty Cool,"This game is fun and suspenseful...but Barbie walks way too slow. It takes me hours to play because the locations are spread out and Barbie needs a walker to get from location 2 location! It's sooooo slow. But a fun game, at that!"
1,This only runs on Win 95,"I had high hopes for this Barbie CD-ROM. Unfortunately, it only has drivers for Win-95. It does not support Win 98, NT, ME or 2000 (and I assume XP).My seven year old daughter cried her eyes out because the software would not run on our Win 2k machine.When you go to the Mattel website, they claim it is not cost effective for them to write drivers for the newer operating systems. (seems cost effective for most other companies)If you are running anything newer than Win 95 and don't want your daughter to cry her eyes out, don't buy this game."
5,My Daughter loves it!,"We purchased this title for my daughter at her 10th birthday. She absolutely loves the game. It is easy to use, and highly recommended."
4,Great fun for my 5-year-old!,"I don't understand the Children's Software Revue at all. My 5-year-old loves this game. And we had no problems finding the clues. My daughter loved chasing the suspect, especially on the giant slide. We thought this game was better than Vacation Mystery, but we like both. I'm just sorry there aren't anymore games in this series yet. I do admit, however, that Barbie is hard to manipulate."
2,"Barbie walks into walls, benchs ...etc","My 6 year old daughter was initially very engaged and excited about playing. However, Barbie is very hard to manipulate, and a large part of the game is simply trying to get barbie to walk without bumping into things. My daughter was very tenacious and played for about 2 hours then was frustrated to tears when the game wouldn't let her in the room whe wanted to go to get the tools she didn't know she had to pick up. We finally just shut down the computer. I have three girls and would love some good software. Please make the games easier to use (not so very!! precise about where to move the mouse) and Barbie a little more intelligent."
4,Great for a used keyboard.,"Great for a used keyboard, but of course, it's Apple. :-) Seller was very honest about the condition, I'm satisfied."
3,Good product but not quite 'like new' as seller described,"This is the older Apple Pro keyboard which I already own for another computer. I did not want the new fangled Apple keyboard or to pay for it when the old ones are so good already, and this one was available for a decent price from the seller as a used item.My only complaint is that they described it as 'like new' which was not the case. It was an great shape, but not 'like new'. The seller should be more honest in their assessment of the condition of the used items they sell. To me 'like new' should mean that is actually like a new item! This one was in great condition for a used item, but not 'like new' and required some cleaning."
2,Not enough content,"The book is just too thin. The described technics do work, but are mostly a description of the buttons and therefore trivial.If you need one Photoshop book buy that of Martin Evening."
3,Good book for more experienced,"I personally found this book to be, in many places, way over my head and in fact preferred the camera raw material in Scott Kelby's book - The Photoshop CS2 Book for Digital photographers."
4,Excellent in spite of repetition,"This is an essential book for using Adobe Camera RAW. For those of us who want to know not only how to use the software to its best effect but also how it works, this is an important book.So why only four stars? The repetition. There is a lot of needlessly repeated stuff in this book - I suspect to get the page count up to what the publisher had been promised and to justify a $40 price. One example (of many): on page 87, Fraser tells us why he sets ACR sharpening to apply only to the preview because Photoshop has better sharpening tools, but when he has a lot of images to process quickly, he sometimes has ACR sharpening to apply to the images. Then on page 105, he tells us all that again."
3,Too scientific and technical,"I have been in the IT world and the photography world for over 12 years now as a profession and when I read the first 5o pages or so of this book, I was completely lost. If you want to know the scientific breakdown of how digital photography works, I guess this book is good but this book did not help me manage my RAW process.Scott"
5,Advanced but not impossible,This is good reading even if you are an amateur. The logical way in which the author has meticulously advanced in stages is quite remarkable.
4,Real World Camera Raw with Adobe Photoshop CS2 (Real World),Excellent text on the use of photoshop CS2 - the tips really work
2,Old LPs are better quality,I am shock to say this but my mother's old LPs have better quality than the 2 CDs that I purchased. We can barely hear several of the songs. Very disappointed!
4,A must for parrots,UVB is a must for parrots. It really brings out their colors and makes them much more active. My bird spends a few hours each day sitting under his bulb.
1,Avian Sun Lamp,The Zoo Med Avian Sun 5.0 Compact Florescent Bulb was defective when I received it but Amazon was quick and professional with the return and refund. I was pleased with Amazon but obviously not with the bulb.
3,Would be great if it lasted...,I bought this in October for my Love Birds and it burnt out in January. You're supposed to replace them every six months. It would be nice if they would at least last that long. My birds do perk up when they are supplemented with the light...It's worth it and I would recommend to anyone with birds. I also purchased the heated perches - They LOVE them!!
1,Bulbs+Shipping=broken,"I purchased this bulb and also a lamp at the same time. I should have thought twice before I ordered a bulb through the mail, because it did not work. These bulbs are very fragile and apparently it got blown before it got to me. I just paid the extra money and bought one from my local pet supply."
4,Good bulb for birds n good company to buy from,This bulb plus the Lamp Fixture provides needed uv and ua rays for your pet cockatiel to get needed uv for feathers and health....Bulb lasts about one year then get a new one....The company was very reliable fast on the order and fast to help you if you have any problems....A very reliable and good company to get the bulb from and a good product needed for your pet bird.
1,Dissapointed Display,I thought that this game would allow me to play more then just 2 sports: Snowboarding and Skating. Although the 2 sports were fun I would prefer more variety then what is given. I rated it a 1 because I really didn't approve of this game!
1,Doesn't Work With Windows XP,"I tried the suggestion from Weihong Yang from Sunnyvale, CA United States and it didn't work. So if anyone else can find a way to get this to work with XP please let us know. Sad that they sell products that don't work with current operating systems. Sad for our children who get them for gifts. I think the software company owes us a fix."
1,Barbie Super Sports,"Beware it you buy this game. It does not run on Windows XP system. My daughter was very disappointed, because it was a reward for good behavior. We did get it to run on a old computer and my daughter loves it. It is very difficult for a 6 year old, but she can grow into it. She was also a little disappointed you could not control the game using the keypad arrow keys, like the other barbie games. Using the mouse to control barbie on a snowboard and rollerblades in a little tough."
3,Very fun!,"A LONG time ago, I had this game and it was really fun. I loved dressing up Barbie and the games attatched. It was not too challenging but not too easy, and it didn't end when you got to a certain level. So, I played it for a long time. Then, fast forward, and I have a little sister who wants to play the game. But it won't play because now we have windows xp. So, if you have windows 95, 98, or 2000 (i think) have fun! If not, don't bother."
3,Not too fun,I am 13.I got this two months before. At first I found it very good but there is no competetion or target so it's not to much enjoying.You may get confused it if you are under 7.So you may need help of an elder.It's only better for ages from 8 to 10.
3,Just for kids 10 & under,"This game may seem very dull and boring to most older kids. Because the will be able to beat the games just like that. Its just too easy for us older kids,or at least me."
1,"Not ""Fair"" to charge money for this","This was, quite possibly, the slowest and most boring book I have ever read. The most interesting character in the book was Elizabeth - and she didn't utter one word. The others were stiff and wooden and not one of them caught my fancy. No real storyline was ever developed - I kept reading because I could see several possibilities, but the author left everything hanging. My best advice in this one is - don't waste your time or money."
1,Included Driver Is for LG Chocolate KG 800 Model Only,"Consider yourself lucky if the USB cable at least charges your phone. It doesn't do anything for my VX8600. The included software is designed for the KG800 Chocolate only.The car charger seems to work fine with the VX8600, and the shipping was fast. These guys could avoid a lot of negative feedback if they just updated the description!"
1,Product provided included defective software,"The electronic products, the cable and 12v charger, appear to work correctly. However the provide CD was defective and the drivers and other supporting software were unreadable on multiple PCs. After emailing a request for a replacement CD, I was provided an internet address to download the related software. The site proved to not provide the matching software. I sent a second email indicating the issue, and have never received a response. I had to search the internet for drivers and use BitPim 1.0 open source to get the cable to work. I would not recommend this vendor to anyone."
2,Works but...,This product worked great but one end was somewhat lose. It still works fine with my LG phone but I have to be careful to not bend the end that goes into the phone else it will break off.
1,Not As Advetised,The USB Data Cable does not work with the LG 8700. The software contains no reference to the 8700. Does not allow data transfer of any kind. All the cable will do is charge the phone. The phone came with a charger.
3,Not what I had hoped...,By reading about this pick I was very hopeful. If you are a acoustic guitar strummer this is not the pick for you. I honestly didn't feel a difference no matter where I placed my finger on the pick. Sorry I just wasn't impressed but that is just my 2 cents. If you want to get a good strumming pick buy the Dunlop standard nylons.
2,Dava Control Guitar Picks,I didn't really have a purpose for these picks other than to experiment a little. As an acoustic rhythm player they are not for me.
4,Picasso Sieze Peintures,"Very rare with Picasso Prints in very good quality, Cover with some aging marks. Bought in an action house in the USA. If anyone want to see photos of the book by e-mail."
1,Not All It Was Cracked Up To Be,"Although I have found some of Petersons's guides helpful in the past, this was not one of them. The information contained in it is pretty basic as far as law school stats go. The book rarely provides any information that you can't find on a law school's website. Even the listings of law schools that it provides are available elsewhere for no charge. It is nice to have all the information put together, but the editors provide no student opinions or answers to other quality of life issues which need addressing. Overall, I was not pleased with this purchase at all."
2,Why not just read the original books?,"Mountain Journeys excerpts a number of good books, although Vermuelen unaccountably picks what seem to be the most boring chapters of each. You'll have more fun if you just read the original books."
1,"Unfortunately, it wouldn't play for us on XP","""Santa"" bought this for my six year old daugher who is horse crazy. She was so excited to play it, but unfortunately, it crashed repeatedly on our Windows XP laptop, so we had to give it up. We've had good luck with other Barbie software, but not this one."
3,"Tried everything, doesn't work on Windows Vista","My 3 kids like this game, although they don't play it ALL the time. It is a nice break from the typical games they have. But I had to install it on my computer that has Windows XP. I tried it on my computer with Vista many different ways with the compatibility settings. Also searched online for a fix. Nothing is avalible that I could find. So don't get it if you have higher than XP is my recommendation. Thanks!"
4,could be better,"this game is okay.the graphics aren't to good,and you have to choose a GIRL name for your horse.Although the horse may be a boy in your mind,Barbie calls them all a girl.its pretty good though."
5,Giant Popovers!,"This is a great popover pan, but be aware that it makes really huge popovers. If you are used to the standard six cup pan, this will use the same quantity of mix. The popovers rise very high, and don't stick, although you still have to grease the pan thoroughly."
5,A GREAT PSYCHOLOGICAL THRILLER!,"This book kept be reading past my bedtime! It was a fast read, and as another reader noted, even though one knew from page one who the killer was the plot was so cleverly entwined that the reader was kept on the edge of her/his seat until the very last page. I can't believe this book hasn't made the best seller's list!"
3,"What excitement this cd has created with me, awesome","What i'm wondering is how one individual can have soo much talent packed into a body. Everytime I hear one of Derek's performances i'm blown away. This man has got to be one of the best jazz pianist around.For this project, Derek was his usual brilliant self. He came up with some dynimate arrangments and keep me entertained for almost an hour. His performances have just about left me speechless.The only complainet I have about this cd was the repertoire. There were a few songs that I didn't like. Even on the disliked songs Derek did a great job of playing them. The repertoire being performed is the only reason for not giving this cd a higher rating.Recommendation: Please buy this cd to see what a legend sounds like."
4,Grace under pressure.,"No family is perfect, and every human being has flaws. The grace in life is in loving our imperfect friends and family members, and in finding our joy regardless of hardships.Bonnie Glover drives this point home in her debut novel, The Middle Sister, a sensitive and well-written story of a young girl growing up in urban America. Pamela's nearly idyllic life is rattled when her father leaves the family, and her mother begins a steady slide into mental illness. Pamela and her two sisters close ranks and take matters into their own hands, caring for their ailing mom and raising themselves.This is a great novel for young female readers, as Pamela struggles with her emotions over the changes taking place in her life."
1,Wrong Item,"I ordered the pink ones and received the blue ones. :(I contacted the seller and they told me to follow the return instructions in the box, well, there weren't any return instructions in the box."
4,Good overview of brewing process and components.,"As a newcomer to home brewing, I looked at some of the books offered by my local brew store. This is a short volume chock full of useful information on types of beers, brewing equipment, beer ingredients, the brewing process, basic recipes, problems, and an appendix of conversion tables. While this book may not contain enough information for all readers to get brewing, most will find enough here to gain a confident knowledge in future shopping and/or conversations. I would recommend picking up this one alongside a good book of recipes."
4,Good Intro to Home Beermaking,"This book was a great introduction to home brewing. It is short, readable and informative. It is a great way to get started brewing your own beer."
5,Another Good Summer Read,"It wouldn't be summer, without a Jackie Collins' book to read. Although I'm still hoping she will write another book about the Santangelos, Deadly Embrace did not disappoint me. Once again, her colorful characters come to life in this fast paced story. I enjoyed it very much. If you are a fan of Jackie Collins, you will not be disappointed......"
5,COULD'NT PUT IT DOWN,"THIS WAS A GREAT JACKIE COLLINS BOOK, YOU COULD'NT WAIT TO FIND OUT WHAT WAS GOING TOHAPPEN TO THE CHARECTERS NEXT"
2,yawn,"This is my first J. Collins and I got it on audiocassette. It's an OK story but I wonder what possessed J. Collins to read it herself? She either has a lisp or she was munching on something the whole time she was reading, it was pretty damn annoying. To make it worse she made every character sound like they were reading a script, people supposedly in love didn't sound in love, angry people didn't sounds angry and on top of it all nobody was very bright. I was easy to put the book down and not really care about what happen to anybody."
3,you'll HATE it badly if you've read lethal seduction,"I read lethal seduction which I read and fell madly in love with, then i decided to read this considering its the prequel. 2 words, pure crap/ trash (u're pick). It was highly disappointing. It seemed as if she were rushing to meet a deadline, and just didn't pay as much attention.She focused purely on michael and some drama, she repeated most of the stuff you will know in lethal seduction, it was very annoying, and both I and my aunt hated it, and were pissed of.BUT if you haven't read Lethal Seduction yet, go on and have a blast you'll love it."
2,"very misleading, but sometimes amusing","This book is almost useless if you're using it to find a good movie to watch. The only movies that it says are good are the ones that you already know are good such as Citizen Kane and Casablanca. Halliwell obviously favors movies made by the British or feature the British. If the movie stars Anthony Hopkins or is directed by Stanley Kubrick than it is sure to get at least one star. This book also shows a preference to Westerns. Most movies with this theme are sure to get a star. As for all the rest, it's like pulling teeth trying to squeeze a star or two out of this Halliwell guy. I'm baffled at how a movie like ""This Is Spinal Tap"" gets four stars while ""Titanic"" only gets two. The best part about this book is reading the reviews of the bad movies. Halliwell's poetic style and clever use of vocabulary when slamming a movie will keep you entertained."
1,Worst film guide I have ever bought.,"This pathetic guide is almost totally useless. The first five movies that happened to be on my TV this week, were not even listed. There is no index of actors or directors and the star system is incompatible with most film goers expectations.I WILL NOT buy the next edition."
1,As useless as Walker's pedantic introduction,"I have long been searching for a good film guide, and this is definitely not it. First of all, the editor's introduction is an updated listing of the retail prices of DVD players and DVD videos! Excluding the opening sentence, the intro does not contain one comment about the book that it is introducing! Also, the author's reliance on the social and critical acceptance of the films blinds him to the true works of genius in the under-appreciated. The work is as bland as possible, the writing dry, and the reviews without conjecture. If you want a cynical compendium of overdone epithets by the author and other stuffy critics, than this book might be for you. Otherwise, if you enjoy movies like me, I advise you to stay away."
4,Big Band Hawkins,"These are just about the only recordings of the short lived Hawkins big band. Taken from various radio broadcasts in 1940, they show a solid band with some good soloists including Joe Guy on trumpet. The sound is prety good for radio recordings.The band never took off and lasted less than a year. Hawkins went back to small bands and rarely played with a big band again."
5,"19"" Heavy Duty Plastic Hangers - Set of 12 - White by Merrick",This is what you need if you have wide\open neck shirts. Good solid hangers that will last.
1,not very interesting,"I bought this hoping to give it to my son for his 10th birthday so that he'd have a new outlet for thoughts and emotions. Turns out the book is intended for girls (all pictures on the cover are of girls) and the ""prompts"" that are given to inspire the child to share their thoughts are very girl-centric. I might hold on to it for my daughter, but I'm not even sure that it would be the tool that I'd want her to have. I'd rather have her thinking of more important things than clothes."
3,camry bushings,"The picture is generic, the real bushings are close to the short fat ones with the metal sleeves in the picture, but with one side lip only and there are 8 pieces all together. Also they are not control arm bushings but actually trailing arm bushings, they go at the bottom of the spindle. The positive side of this kit is that it fits camry models from 88 to 98. Keep in mind that you will only need 4 bushings per vehicle. They fitted perfectly on my 88 Camry wagon and my 94 model LE 4 cylinder."
5,Better than Great!,"We have both a double kayak and a single kayak. It was an effort to hump both kayaks to many of the out-of-the-way spots that are accessible to kayaks only. I purchased the carrier for my husband's birthday, and at first he was affronted that I thought he couldn't handle the boats himself, being a manly outdoorsy kind of guy. However, when we assembled the carrier and he tried it out, he fell in love with it! The carrier is easily maneuverable and the full-sized kick stand allows stable loading, unloading and parking.We are anxious to put it to the full range of use next spring, but it has already opened up many more opportunities to access more remote locations that we otherwise would have avoided due to the length and difficulty of getting to the launch site and/or portage.I finally found a gift my husband is excited about. The shipping was prompt, the packaging was secure, and the assembly was easy."
4,Canoe carrier,Am using carrier to transport 2 kayaks with two people navagating over dry sand and rough stone. We put the smaller on top and strap to carrier. Total weight is around 170#. It is far better than carrying the two separately and making additional trips.A wider larger tire would be of help. Am overall satisfied with product.
1,Hate items not ready-to-go out of the box,"Both of my unit's inner wheel guards were factory installed backwards. Therefore when you tighten the locknut, the inner wheel guard presses against the spokes preventing the wheels from turning. The unit is welded, so I do not see a way to flip the inner wheel guards. It took some time to determine what the problem was as the blurry black and white pictures on the instructions are virtually worthless. Pacific Cycle placed a red piece of paper in the instructions begging the consumer not to return the product to the store but to call their toll free number to correct any problems. Unfortunately, it's Friday, the 3rd of July, and they're off for the holiday. Since my 4th of July plans are not important enough to Pacific Cycle, I'm returning the product."
4,large enough for the larger kayak,"This is my second carrier. The 1st one, smaller, (2 years old now), works great for my 14'. The extra weight of my loon 160T needed a strong, easy to wheel through sand, grass, dirt cart. My camping sites are always a few hundred feet away, this carrier makes the walk easier and possible. Attaching the kayak takes some work to stay where I wanted it, but I solved that."
5,attractive and well made,I installed mine in the side of a bathroom cabinet next to the throne. I used the recommended bracket without the spring. It is a good looking well made product in satin nickel.
1,No hardware included,"The holder does not have the necessary hardware to install it. It came only with two screws. According to instructions, the mounting bracket with a spring is required to install the paper holder but it has to be purchased separately. The company's web site does not sell anything and no store in our area carries this brand. Without mounting hardware the paper holder is unusable."
2,Incomplete,"This paper holder looks great and functions fine but does not come with the necessary hardware to install. No spring is included, no installation kit is offered separate from the paper holder. Your only choice is to buy another paper holder, through it away, and install this one using the hardware from the one you threw away."
1,Piece of C***P!,"Purchased this item, and while it was nice enough looking, it broke within 4 months. The side brackets that hold the roller seemed to be riveted on, with no chance of repair once broken. Try the Franklin Brass 9097SN, I just purchased that, and it's solidly built, with the brackets screwed on from the back."
4,Toilet tissue totty,"Given the small confines of my ""john room"", this recessed paper holder is perfect! This was the only satin nickel version I found - almost all others are available only in chrome. Looks nice and allows for sufficient elbow room while sitting on the throne."
2,Satin Nickel ??? Looks like grey spray paint.,"Finish is very poor quality. Looks like a spray paint job. Spend more money and buy elsewhere. This was one of the cheaper satin nickel recessed holders...and like they say, you get what your pay for....it looks cheap!"
3,Satin Nickel? My Unit Doesn't Look the Color in the Pic,"My unit does not look like satin nickel, but brushed nickel - a dull chrome color. It looks nice, but doesn't go with the light fixtures I purchased (the color in the picture does). Not the end of the world, just disappointed we installed it prior to noticing the color mix-up.Purchased Gatco 783 Mounting Hardware to Install."
3,toilet paper holder,"If you want a recessed toilet paper holder this one is your basic type. I ordered this through Amazon because I could not find a satin nickel finish in any of the local stores. The disappointing part of ordering this one is that it does not come with a backing plate, so if you want to mount it to the side of a vanity cabinet you will need to purchase a backing plate for it (at an additional cost)."
3,So-So quality,"I have bought other Gatco items and been very happy with the quality for the price. However, in this case, the product needs some quality control. The items, two recessed toilet paper roll holders, both had the same problem- the arm on one side that holds the spring loaded tube in was installed crooked and I was unable to remove the retaining screws without stripping the screw heads. A small detail, but one that should not have left the factory in that condition."
3,looks nice but...,Its a really nice item but it doesn't come with the installation hardware that you need to buy separately...I wish it was mentioned somewhere...
2,Not up to par,"The finish is much darker than the other nickel items in my bathroom.It was difficult to get the screws started through the slots in the spring loaded bracket. The first screw went in a little way then stripped. I had difficulty removing it -- I had to use a pair of vice grips. Luckily I had a left over nickel screw from my shower installation. This one started easily and tightened ok. I should have learned from the first screw. The second screw (provided with the unit) finally started, but stripped when it was ALMOST tight. There wasn't enough of the screw exposed to get it out, so there is a small gap between the fixture and wall on that side."
4,Not fancy but works fine.,For the price it's fine. It's not fancy and does what it is supposed to do. Cheaper than Home Depot
3,"Cheap, but it works",I also installed this into the side of a bathroom vanity by cutting a hole and reversing the (not included) mounting bracket and holding it in place with two nuts and bolts purchased from the hardware store. For whatever reason the outside frame is a little warped and does not rest flush so you see a little gap at the top. Other than that it works... but only with small sized toilet paper rolls.Lowes sells this exact same item for $80. I would be extremely upset if I bought this for $80.
5,It does the job!,"What can I say about a toilet paper holder? This one is attractive, appears sturdy, and does what it is supposed to do. I like it."
2,OK for What It Is!,We needed a recessed nickel finish toilet paper holder. This was the only one that I could find at a reasonable price. It works fine and was easy to install. At a glance it looks fine but is very light weight almost kind of tinny feeling.When the toilet paper is in the part that shows is fine. I think that before we installed it we could have bent it in half. Hopefully it stands up better than it looks. I can't believe that there aren't more choices out there.
4,Toilet Tissue Roll Holder,"This item is very nice. It was received very quickly with no damage. My only reason to down rate the item was because it included a special ""in-the-wall"" holder to mount the device. I didn't need this and would have preferred to not chose it and had a lower price."
3,OK--but not what I was expecting,"This is a handy little translator, except for one glaring problem: There's no search function. It's full of great phrases, but you have to know exactly where to find them to use them. If you're in a situation in which you need to find a phrase quickly, you can't search for it by keyword--or by any other means for that matter. The manual actually says there's a search function, but it seems to be referring to another model. The search function on this particular model is completely missing. Anyway, I had gotten it for my sister who was traveling to China (with no knowledge of the language whatsoever), so we returned it when we realized it simply wasn't practical. The seller was extremely helpful and offered me a refund promptly upon return of the item. We ultimately purchased the more expensive Besta MT-7000, which was a far superior machine that did everything we needed it to do--and it saved my sister more than a few times in China!"
4,Very Good Story But With Poor Editing Problem,"Very interesting story from a very talented writer. The only problem of this book is the Editing. I just could not believe that the professor guy in the same name had died twice and died quite differently. But still, highly recommended if you like 'White Star,' 'Point of Impact/Black Light/Time to Hunt.'"
5,Excellent book for anyone who is into character creation etc,"This is an excellent book featuring original art from all of the warcraft games including Warcraft3. I'm studying to become a character designer for games/movies and I love this book as a reference and ispiration for various weapons and clothing/armor pieces as well as characters. The book gave me a glimpse at the production proccess of the games. This book will also be good if you're into drawing/illustrating since it features the original works of the designers of the games before they've became the final product. Would probably also make a nice collection piece for anyone who is interested in the warcraft series, but I'm not sure about that."
3,Good Book Bad Service,"I spent 7 Dollars for expedited shipping on this product. Product showed up bended in half ruining the artwork. And then crammed into a 5,5 mail slot rather then left in the office... Good book but I don't recommend anyone use priority mail shipping. Nor bother with expedited shipping use a real delivery service not USPS."
3,"Good product, however: lousy instructions & difficult installation for a DIY","The product appears to be high quality. It is remanufactured, the drive gear appears to be new. Functions (speed, sound level) identically to the original.The supplied instructions were incorrect, referring to 3/16"" drill and rivets. This particular motor is attached with 1/4"" rivets, which are harder to come by (try NAPA) and require a much more expensive rivet gun.Installation is not easy for a DIY, at least not on my 97 Suburban. I would do this again if needed (since I now have the experience), but would not have tackled myself had I known the learning curve."
3,textbook,"I had to read this book for a class. some of it was very intersesting, but some of it was also pretty boring!"
2,Fun for a few minutes,"Although the idea is neat, this toy lost its fun factor after a few times. The smoke solution is dangerous for children and a parent should handle it at all times, which is not by idea of a fun toy. If a child is scared to touch the toy then it is not so fun anymore. Also, after it smokes and you shoot the cannon your child might get bored. My 7 year old sure did. It's a cute cannon, but not worth the money."
1,BULLSH*T,"They, whoever did this, placed a really cheap product with a photo of a totally different and a lot more expensive one. You think you are getting a deal? well.. you will get a small box with a pen and some stickers.. not even worthy to take the time to return it back...I am very dissapointed... THIS IS A FRAUD, AND SOMEONE SHOULD DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS. They are lying to people."
1,Not for the Serious Student of Palmistry,"When I bought this video I had hoped to learn the basics of palmistry through actual readings on tape. It turned out that the sound is quite badly done,and the British accents of the participants are (for me at least) impossible to decipher. Over and over I have tried to glean whatever information I could from this video and each time the sound, the accents and the quality of the videography prevent my doing so. The information given is not organized either. I consider it a waste of my hard earned money."
4,Worth Reading for historical value,"St Elmo was one of only three American works of literature to sell more than a million copies in the 19th century. Almost unknown today, it is the story of a wicked and evil man who is saved by the love of a virtuous woman. Augusta Evans owes Jane Austen some debt for the plot."
1,save your money,I lived in Florence for 6 months and made the mistake of taking this book along...worthless!
4,Very comprehensive grammar,"This is one of the most comprehensive grammars available on Japanese. Although old layout and typesetting has a detrimental effect on the readability, this is a must-have for any student of the Japanese language with aspirations towards linguistics."
3,This book is for linguists,"This book is for serious linguists studying Japanese. If you are looking for a reference book as a learner of Japanese, you'd better find another one."
5,I don't buy any other brand of spatula,"I have several Oxo spatulas - they don't warp, bend, peel, discolor or melt - even if used to stir things in a hot pan. So far, none of them have broken, and I have had several of them for a few years. Great quality."
5,Best Spatula Ever!,"The OXO Good Grips silicone spatula is the best spatula ever. Great size, great shape, and the tomato color is really cool. Sooo tired of all the glow-in-the-dark colors these things are being made in these days."
5,Works great!,"Strong handle, firm yet flexible head. Has lasted through a year's worth of dishwasher runs and still looks and works great!"
3,Nice for cat lovers,This is a nice book for cat lovers. It doesn't really show much in the way of gardens. Was hoping to get some nice ideas out of it so was a bit disappointed.
5,"NEWS RADIO, 1ST AND 2ND SEASON","THIS IS A COMEDY FOR THOSE WHO DO NOT LAUGH EASILY TO TODAYS SITCOMS. THE HUMOR IS FRESH AND ORIGINAL, AND OFTEN BASED ON THINGS WE ALL THINK, BUT DON'T SAY. THE ACTORS FIT TOGETHER BETTER THEN MOST SITCOMS I HAVE SEEN IN YEARS. IT IS A SHAME THAT IT WENT OFF AIR AND I AM GREATFUL IT IS AVAILABLE NOW ON DVD."
3,Not as funny as I remembered,I think I remember the other seasons were funnier. I enjoyed this but I'm not adding it to my keeper shelf
5,Need more NEWS RADIO,Everything about this sitcom is essential to escape from the world we live in - the more I watch the first three seasons the more I think...WHEN ARE THE REST OF THE SEASONS COMING OUT ON DVD...hurry please I need more News Radio!!!
5,News radio- why did it go off the air?,"This DVD was probably the best bang for my buck. It's hilarious, I mean laugh out loud, slap the knee funny. In addition, the DVD's are jam packed with episodes, each of the 4 has 10 episodes! Great show at a great price."
5,Utterly delicious!,"Anything I might say has already been echoed by so many others, so I'll only add one personal concept, which is that ""Luncheon at the Waldorf"" is without a doubt my own favourite episode in this box... Everything just came together perfectly - especially the pacing... The whole series, though, most particularly season 3 later on, was just a series of strokes of genius!"
5,Wrong disks arrived,NewsRadio is a great show. No complaints there. But the two disk set arrived with two of the same disk. I am missing half of the product and now have to find out how to get the rest of my set! Make sure you save your product slip in case you have the same problem.
5,Is it really shipping?,I pre-ordered this DVD about a year ago (hoping to get it as soon as it was available) and I got an email yesterday saying it had shipped and I would receive it in 5-9 business days! Is this true? Can't wait! I discovered this show after it went to syndication and it became a nightly ritual for me to watch it at 11:00 before going to bed. I love this show!! It is one of the funniest out there. I haven't found it playing anywhere or anytime now that I'm living in southern California... so I can't wait to own my own collection of NewsRadio. I only hope that the rest of the seasons are released soon because I know I will watch seasons 1-2 very quickly and be wanting more.
4,So cool,"Missing some of the original episodes when this series first came out,made this an excellent watch for me. Everyone is excellent in delivery and style."
5,Best of the best,"In the era of the extremely exhausted american sitcom, newsradio combines a brilliant character contrast with razor sharp humour. Bill Mcneal played by Phil Hartman will win you over with just one of his one liners, while Mr James and Dave spa intillectual jabs!! This incredibly underated sitcom easily competes with other influential greats such as sienfeld, spin city, frasier and blossom. Despite the consistant reliance on slapstick, (provided by Andy Dick falling over seconds before the theme tune in each episode) this sitcom oozes an intelligent portrayal of human behaviour exagerated for your viewing pleasure!! Take it from someone who knows american sitcoms THIS KICKS ASS!!!!"
5,Absolutely Hilarious!,"This has got to be one of the best sitcoms I have ever had the pleasure to watch. I was a Kids in the Hall fan, and truly wondered how Dave Foley would fare in this one when it began, and I must admit he took it and ran. The writers are ingenious and the actors chemistry together is amazing. Whoever is responsible for casting this show needs a star on the Hollywood walk of fame."
5,Sitcom perfection,"I have never been one to show loyalty to shows and collect episodes and watch them repeatedly, until newsradio came along. Tight, absurdist comedy that has heart and was near perfect until the death of Phil Hartman (rip). Jon Lovitz replaced Hartman, but the series seemed to falter a bit, although there are episodes (smart mathew- smathew) that can rank with the best of the previous seasons. Just Shoot Me came from the same production team and writers more or less, but never had the chemistry that newsradio had. It was truly an ensemble cast. I can only hope that so many buy the 1st and 2nd season dvd that they will put the rest on dvd as well. If you loved newsradio, write a review and raise the profile of this amazing show."
5,FUNNY FUNNY FUNNY,"I LOVE THIS SHOW NOW MORE THAN I DID WHEN IT FIRST AIRED. GREAT CAST, GREAT PLOTS, FUNNY, AND WHAT CAN I SAY-PHIL HARTMANN!!!"
1,terrible,"Very upset with myself for buying this. I think the other two reviewers were smoking something.This is bad on many levels, as a teaching aid, as art, maybe one could argue it works from a farcical humour perspective.I also bought the Tomas Cruz conga method which is a very good teaching aid.I write this in the hope that I might save someone the mistake of buying this like I did."
4,A Little 'Garage Like' But Great,"This DVD has the feel of being shot by your next door neighbor. At the same time, Jorge does a great job of explaining each of the different hand moves and demonstrating them. You are able to pick up the essentials easily."
5,Unexpected Suprise!,I purchased this book for my Dad for his birthday. We had gone to Dorney numerous times throughout my childhood. This book brought back many found memories(while I reviewed it prior to gift wrapping). My Dad is really hard to buy for. I was great to see his smile when he unwrapped it and immediately began to view it. We both discovered many new details about the history of the park.
4,Amazing wealth of international beauty tips!,"I've bought many copies for gifts. I also have two copies for myself. Though it could have been so much better with illustrations and some photos, it is still one of my absolute favorite beauty books!This is because of the rich diversity of beauty treatments, adornments, fashion, and grooming tips described. It would be a particularly great book for a young woman/teen of non-European or multiracial descent living in the United States where the beauty standard is still quite shockingly narrow.This book teaches pride in one's own unique beauty and cultural aspects (from China, Africa, India, Brazil, Japan, the Caribbean, Mexico, Indigenous Americas and more)There's also a great intro history of beauty and adornment from ancient times to the present, ""Beauty Throught the Ages"" which I totally love!"
4,Best deal,"Buy you own cheap - don't call in the furnace guy and pay $$$. Easy to do and much, much cheaper."
4,Great replacement filters,"These are great replacement filters for an Aprilaire system. They look and feel identical to the OEM products, but they do seem to wear out rather quickly (hence the 4 stars)."
4,BestAir A35-6 Aprilaire 35 Metal Waterpad,Our home humdifier is a life saver in Tahoe. No humidity at all here. This filter wasrecommended to us and works great. Change it once a year and the system performsas advertised.
2,Not really calibratable,"Purchased (3) of these.. One came with a broken glass. Poor packaging by Amazon (nothing in the box but the items). They are replacing it.But the real question is calibration? If you can't calibrate them they are useless. The two I got are off by 10% from each other.There IS a screw slot on the back but turning it turns the entire instrument in the case, including the scale. Removing the back allows one to carefully hold the scale and move the mechanism to calibrate it. Also, Amazon gives you no place to click and ask a question about the product. Grump Grump. I'll update this once I get the replacement and see how they calibrate etc. That may add one star if it all works. The description should be changed to ""un-calibratable for the average user"". They are really nice looking."
1,The product is not made by Apirlaire as stated but is is made by a secondary company not stated in description,The product is not made by Apirlaire as stated but is is made by a secondary company not stated in description
5,Thanks Wounded Bird!,"After giving up on if this album will ever making it to CD, along comes Wounded Bird to release it! This is a great, hard-rocking early 80's album, with standout songs including ""Ready Or Not"", ""Take It Off"", and ""Depending On Love"". The sound quality is really good too. Definitely worth checking out for fans of hard rock guitar."
5,RIGGS ROCKS,As I sampled this on amazon I knew I had to have it I first heard riggs from the movie soundtrack heavy metal radar rider and heartbeat the cd proves that they had a different sound than the movie but none the less this disc is hot it got a real good 80's metal/hardrock vibe to it ready or not is the first track that lets on knows what time it is brings on back to the days of popin the cassette in your 82 camero and hit the strip nobody cares is a nice hardrock boy meets girl affair thing but will have one singing along it's like one track after another will have you move and feeling good will drawing pity for todays youth who have no concept of real rock. this cd is a must have for all diehard eights fans this and anything from montrose as well this band was so underappretiated
3,Much Poppier than the Heavy Metal Soundtrack,This has nothing to equal Radar Rider and nothing as bad as Heartbeat. Still it isnt that rockin.
5,Selected drawings from his first thee books,"An update and review of his first three books, with selected sample included. They vary from simple benches to tables, candle stands, and cabinets.john (:>)))"
4,good gun - okay accuracy,"this rifle is very sturdy and looks authentic, for the price. However, the clip has trouble containing the rounds in the 5 seconds between when you put them in, and when you insert the mag.Accuracy is okay from about 50 feet, poor from further away. Actually i have a 20 dollar pistol that is more precise, partially because the carbon sight is easier to use (the one on this is poorly designed and akward).overall, not a bad buy for the money."
1,Zero Stars,"It's an inappropraite thing to put on a T-Shirt about any ""Moslem"" country not just ""Kuwait"". And I think every moslem agree. I actually got an email floating around the net which contains a link to kuwait t-shirts, now.. not all of them are inacceptable but most of them are. Definitely must be removed."
2,Hmmmm,"I started off enjoying this book. It was well-written, although some of the sentence structure could be puzzling. By the ending, though, I was completely let-down, and I will not be keeping this book to re-read. After showing her strength through all the hard times, Madeleine seems to become wishy washy and a complete doofus. The ending seems tacked-on and ridiculous, and I don't buy it. Is the author trying to say that Madeleine becomes her mother in the end? I think this could have been a much better book with a lot more to offer the readers, if Madeleine had kept her strength and faced reality."
5,Collets,"They are a good quality product and work well, the price is as good as a person can expect to find."
2,Didn't Really Change Anything,When my dishes started looking filmy I looked into it and found about about the phosphate ban. Bought TSP and gave it a try. At first it looked like there was a small improvement. Over time though (even with continued use and changing up the amounts) things went back to normal. The only thing that worked for me was adding Lemishine (pretty much just citric acid I believe) to my detergent. After the first wash the dishes that had built up the film were noticeably cleaner. With the second wash they looked brand new. I'll probably look into finding just the ingredients of this product cheaper since I'll be using a lot but I think I'll add TSP every once in a while just to be safe.
2,No use for dishwasher,I put 2 tsp in my dishwasher and it doesn't do anything to make the dishes cleaner. Don't understand why people recommend it for that use.
1,TSP illegal where we live,"Yes, TSP is great! We used to use it for a lot of things, especially for washing walls, etc, before painting. Now, at least in NYC, it's illegal. Make sure it's legal in your area."
3,Real TSP (mostly),"This is real TSP, not the substitute now often sold as ""TSP"". It is 6.1% phosphorous, notably less than the 8.5% phosphorous of an old container of DAP brand TSP I have here. Neither is pure TSP, but the Savogran product clearly has more ""filler"" (sodium carbonate AKA washing soda). I use it to improve the performance of phosphorous free dishwasher soap. It works .. but I wish it was purer."
5,Excellent product,"This product is the closest i have found to the old Spic'n Span I used to buy for household and wooden deck cleaning. Works great on soap scum in the bathroom, grease on the floors and mildew on outdoor decks."
3,Savogran 10621 Trisodium Phosphate (TSP),"I read the reviews and most people said this was good to clean old grease splatters off walls and to mop with as well.I wasn't truly ""moved"" by this product. It had nothing to do with Amazon, but I was just disappointed with the product itself. I can get better results with a $1 bottle of Awesome.It was hit and miss....and this was a MISS for me."
2,This is not Trisodium Phosphate!,"I bought thinking this was pure tri-sodium phosphate, when it arrived I realized that it was simply a cleaner that contained only a small amount of TSP. Just know what you are buying!"
3,No Dramatic Results,"Bought this product after reading numerous reviews saying it performed miracles in the dishwasher, etc. I haven't seen any dramatic differences, though. Could be user error, as I have never used this stuff before, but it hasn't wowed me by any means."
1,BUYER SKIP THIS BUSSINESS,"This was the most disapointing gift i ever purchased,for a train enthousiast.absolute garbage.embarassing.so much so i did not give this as a gift.I passed a hundred dollars to him in a card and statedhe would be better served using his own expertise expertise as i was haveing ahard time finding a crossing that would meet his needs.PS when they went home i gave them to my four year old.GARBAGE AS CHEAP AS THEY COULD POSSIBLE BE.NEVER AGAIN,AND FROM BACHMANN THE NUMBER ONE NAME IN TRAINS.WITH PRODUCT LIKE THAT. IT IS WORTH RE THINKING OUT SOURCEING, TO THE LOWEST BIDDER.WHAT HAPPEND TO QUALITY CONTROLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.THE SHIPPER SHOULD BE EQUALY ASSAMED TO SELL SUCH TRASH.CHRISTIAN T CLEMENTSCLEMENTSCTC@LIVE.COMHAPPY NEW YEAR"
3,not for younger kids,"Have to agree with other reviewers here. Too much talk, not enough action . If you wade through all the somewhat manic banter, he really has a very good fundamental set of progressive drills for learning how to drum properly, but my five-year-old lost interest after about five minutes and so did I. Maybe older kids who are self-motivated will get more out of this."
1,Can't stomach this vid!,"Get to the point, already! This guy just talks and talks, taking forever to get the actual lessons. My son does not have the patience to watch this video, and he really gets into watching bands play. He absolutely loves the drums, but this is not at all holding his interest. Though he's young, I think he'd prefer to watch a drumming video that's targeted to adults."
3,It's ok,"Video is ok. Bought for my 4 year old to watch while he ""played"" his first drumset, but it didn't really hold his or my interest. Would be better suited for a child a little older. I like that the guys are silly on the dvd and making it fun for the kids, but it's also kind of corny and looks outdated. Maybe in a year or two my son will like it better."
2,Very slow,I bought this for my son and he loves music especially drums it kept his attention for about 10-15 min I was really hoping he would like this
4,My son likes it,I thought it was kind of cheesy but my 2 year old responds well to it and tries to drum along so I guess it works. Based on my son's review I would recommend this to anyone with a young one that wants to make some noise.
4,Good for the young or casually interested,"This book is a combination of a visual guide and a condensed history of pretty much all the Indian tribes east of the Mississippi-quite a bit of real estate for a book of 48 pages. The text is simply written and offers only the barest bones of a historical outline; the information on the culture, religion, clothing, artwork, and the fur trade is rather off topic (this is supposed to be military history) but was pretty informative and contained some information new to me. And like all Osprey books the color plates are the best part of the book (I always save them for last when I get a new book from this series). Overall, its usefulness as a visual guide and the information on the non-military topics led me to give this one four instead of three stars."
3,Just a little too easy,"I got this game for my 9th birthday. I zipped through it in less than an hour. It's probably better for kids under 7. My 7 year-old sister also beat it fast. The colors are great. The dolphin maze is a little hard, but the rest of the games are pretty easy. It might be better if there were some danger involved (like a shark or squid) and Barbie had to face it. Compared to Pokemon and Toy Story II, this game is really easy, the easiest of all the Gameboy games I have."
4,VERY EASY TO BEAT.,"This game was easy to beat. But I thought it was semi-fun. When you have around 15 minutes to kill, this is a good game. Plus, you can play the games over again to earn charms for earings, necklaces, and bracelets. Although it is definitly aimed at a VERY young crowd, this game wasn't a let down. Just a little easy."
1,A disappointed mother,"My husband and I purchased Game Boys for both our children, my son is 7 and my daughter just turned 4. This is the game we chose for her since she is into all things Barbie. It was a great let down. I played the entire game in under an hour and it didn't hold my daughter's attention for more than several minutes. As she told me herself, ""MOM, it doesn't DO anything!""She now fights with her brother over the Super Mario brothers, and she is quite good at that one!This game is just too simple. We all like video games that are challenging and where the character does more than swims around and around and around. That is what this game does. These games are just too expensive to waste your time on ones like this. The only neat thing was that this game cartridge came in a great plastic case. But that isn't worth the money!"
2,What a disappointment,"I bought this for my 4 year old daughter and when I sat down with her to show her how play, I was angry. The game is so simplistic that I found it to be an insult to girls. Does Nintendo think girls aren't intelligent enough to handle a more complex game?"
3,"Will not run on Winsows XP, 95 or 98 only","I bought this game not knowing about this but --- This game does not run on Windows XP. After some research, I found this web page: http://support2.vugames.com/kidsgames/answer.aspx?ID=3768This is the information from the VU official web site. If you have Windows XP, do not buy this software. If this information was helpful to you, please say so. Have a good day!!B. J. from Poughkeepsie, NY"
3,good for younger players,"""Barbie Ocean Discovery"" is a game about Barbie having to find a secret underwater treasure. To do this she needs to overcome a challenge like a maze or a picture puzzle. When she finishes a challenge she gets a piece of a map that will lead her to the secret treasure, or a gem that will serve as one of the keys that will help her open the treasure. For a girl my age this role-playing game was pretty boring with very little difficulty and one that I finished in about half an hour, but I think a 5- or 6-year old little girl might enjoy this more."
5,Quality,I find these never seem to fail me! This is #4 of 4 cables that I have used around the church! The shielding Technology is superior!
1,It's not fun if it doesn't install,"I bought this software for a young girl, who thought it looked like fun. But I couldn't get it to install on any of several XP computers.Either this product is a liquidation product that may not work on later computers or I received defective software. When I contacted the seller, there wasn't any customer service behind it and they wouldn't take it back. Buyer beware!"

3,Who can you trust...,"Imagine waking up to find intruders in your home. If that isn't horrific enough, imagine those same intruders, who you were fortunate enough to escape, murdering your next door neighbor right before your very eyes. This is exactly what happens to Denise Richardson, setting off a string of events that would weaken the resolve of the strongest person.Detective Terrance O'Neal is the homicide investigator working the case. Denise and Terrance are immediately attracted to each other, but Terrance is determined to not let Denise's beauty distract him from finding the murderer, even if Denise is the prime suspect.Will Terrance be able to prove Denise is innocent, allowing them to act upon their mutual attraction? Or will fate step in and deal them each a bad hand? The combination of romance, mystery and intrigue makes this debut novel an enjoyable read. I look forward to other works by Ms. Smith.Reviewed by Renee Williamsof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"
2,not mac compatable!,"probbaly a great product, but u should know DONT BUY THIS WITH A MAC!!!!!!!! it wont work. it was useless. and all the drivers for the samsung t629 are for pc's, so i cant even use the included software. macs and pc's should learn how to coordinate, and not make ervything such a hassle to figure out compatibility issues."
2,Not compatible with Mac computers,"Well, it will charge my phone through USB, but the sync cable is useless for data transfer on a Mac. Samsung has no software drivers to enable it to work. Everything must be transfered via bluetooth."
4,Good Value. Cable works with SamT629,"Got cable for 2 bucks. Came with a ""homemade"" CD that I didn't trust. Downloaded the program directly from Samsung website. Not tech savvy here but all I wanted to do is transfer pics/videos from cell to pc so I can share via e-mail. It works!"
5,works great,"it took a while to get, but it works with no problems. Just go on samsungs website and DL the program for free"
1,WILL NOT CHARGE SAMSUNG M619,"Door stop....They have the M610 listed so I took a chance, but it will not charge the phone. So, I'm out $10.00 (50% of the sprint price, however, Sprint is out of stock right now...)"
4,Works with D807,It works well with my Samsung D807. Does not charge though. Using Samsungs PC Studio I can sync with Outlook and transfer files. Not terribly fast though transfering to added MicroSD card. (Maybe 0.5 MB per second at best?)
1,Great cable but not for Mac,"I am sure it is a great cable but it does not work for Apple computers. Samsung does not have a driver that supports the cable and a mac. The company I ordered the cable from is great, easy to work with, but once again it does not work on a mac. Bummer. I have repeated that it does not work on a mac multiple times because I want to make it very clear that it doesnt work with a mac. I blame Samsung."
2,Do not buy from DLN Enterprises!,I waited 8 days for my order to be shipped only to receive an email today saying they are cancelling my order because this item is out of stock. Now I've lost more than week's time and I have to find another vendor. This is a terrible way for them to treat their customers. I will never buy from them again.
4,Great Product!,"Allows you to import/export pics and mp3 files. Also edits contact information, sends texts, and edits calender."
5,Got the job done,"Ordered this cable for my Samsung BlackJack works great. I was able to update my phone to windows mobile 6. Very pleased. Don't know if it matters but it does charge the phone, just not as fast as with an outlet."
5,Sync USB cable,The cable was shipped promptly and a great price. It arrived just as described and worked correctly. I am very happy
4,Back To Lochdubh for a good read,I'm glad that M.C.Beaton has written quite a few books as I will miss reading about Hamish Macbeth and Agatha Raisin when I have caught up with her two series.The Death Of A Traveling Man was a humorous fun read featuring Hamish Macbeth who is now a Police Sergeant much to his chagrin. A traveling man comes to Lochdubh and Hamish instantly dislikes him. Some of the town people soon start out of character. One of them is a minister who starts preaching hell and brimstone sermons from the past centuries. Hamish suspects the traveler caused the changes in the villagers.Hamish has also been given a sidekick P.C. Willie who is a cleanliness fanatic. They now share the police station as their home and their relationship is quite humorous.. A murder occurs and Hamish is on the trail again to solve the murder. I find the Hamish books to be a fun and relaxing read. Would read the Hamish books in order they were written if possible.
2,Manages to be at once both slight and offensive.,"Death of a Travelling Man is the first I've read of the Hamish MacBeth series, and it doesn't particularly inspire me to go back for seconds. Both the titular sleuth, an easygoing yet somewhat crotchety everyman police officer, and the small Scottish town of Lockdubh, while not the simply enchanting hamlet the PR material would have one believe, have promise, but the story is unambitious and largely mediocre, and the book's cavalier attitude toward its crimes and victims - impatient, desultory, and eventually devolving to the point where what is essentially a rape is milked for laughs - derails it. Could've used more compassion and depth, a bit more investment in its setting and characters; the resolution of the mystery is rather trite as well. Don't bother."
2,Have not read,Have not read this one. I tried to read the first in the series and could not get involved in it enough to finish it.
2,wish for more,This product does what it is supposed to..... But it is fairly tiny and will find itself falling off over and over again. Especially on the hand where the fabric is fairly thin and will un-stick itself and create a chain reaction that will end with the mini Lee on the cold floor....Sexy but disappointing....
2,Was really expecting A LOT MORE,Let me start by saying I'm decent at Krav Maga and other Combat Arts. These videos are well done as far as learning step by step. They break it down at least 5-6 times in every move so now madder how slow you learn anyone can grasp this. However they really don't teach much Krav Maga as they seem to teach girls self defense. This isn't a bad thing per say however advanced and deadly moves are know shown in these videos. Those wanting to learn enough to feel they can defend themselves from your average attacker THEN THIS VIDEO IS FOR YOU. However if you want to learn true Krav Maga look else were as I find all of these videos to maybe get you past your first belt.Sum: Good for learning THE BASICS ONLY. If you want to learn true/advanced Krav Maga ITS NOT FOR YOU.
2,Krav Must Be Practiced With Others,I thought I would learn more Krav techniques while recovering from getting beat down throughout a few months of actual classes. Not so much. You really need the physical contact to grasp the concepts.
4,Bought for a Friend,I did get this as a gift for a friend and he is thoroughly enjoying it......I knew he wanted this and was able to find it for a steal...Thanks so Much
5,Well Rounded Resource,"Dr. Geisler gives a well rounded survey of issues pertaining to the discipline of apologetics. I highly recommended it! If it is your desire to be a serious student of apologetics, this resource definitely belongs in your library."
2,Read with caution,"While this is a large and comprehensive collection of Geisler's work one would have wished he would have been more accurate in his description of Van Til's thinking. As most non-pressupositional apologists, he has many inaccurate representations which is a shame considering that Van Til was the most influential apologist of the century. For a much better study one should read Greg Bahnsen's book.However, there are a lot of articles that will encourage the beliver and give him more confidence in the Truth."
2,Not what I hoped it would be,"Though it is obvious the author put a lot of time into writing this, the subjects are not intuitive - that is, they are not the categories one would typically wonder about and look up. At least, the ones I wanted to find were not there - such as social subjects and how that relates to the Bible, etc. Further, each subject is written in a rambling style that doesn't seem (at the end of each) to reach a summarized conclusion of any kind. This was a lot of money to spend on a book that is so loosely created."
2,Faith requires no apology,"Geisler should apologize for his poor understanding of logic, reason and science. His restatement of Gould's evolutionary ideas would be unrecognizable to Gould himself. Dietrich Bonhoeffer and Philip Yancey have reconciled the distinct spheres of faith and science and have not tried to distort science to make faith look valid. Faith is valid independent of all science and this book fails to make that basic observation. Geisler does have more success in defending Christian faith against competing religions, while again the defense is a divergence from understanding the essence of Christian faith."
1,"Some good points, but Calvinism is attacked right and left","Some good points I see, but this book includes a lot of Calvinist attacks. This book rejects the gospel and thus, I will not give it more than one star."
2,Why go see a Toyota dealer to learn about Hondas,"Mr. Geisler is far from an expert on many of these topics. I feel he just flipped through other peoples books and wrote down what he wanted to present to others.Example is, his talks on say Zen. Anyone whose spent an hour online knows that the whole point of Zen or Eastern Religions, is to achieve an allocentric state of being, aka, enlightenment.One of the problems is, in the West (USA) the ego is taught as being part of the brain that...blah blah blahThe ego isnt part of the brain, its your symbol of yourself, resulting from being selfcenterd. By meditating, aka, keeping your attention on something else, aka, whats infront of you (the moment), you can go beyond this egocentric state, the state that leads to suffering.In this allocentric state, time feels to have stopped, life feels blissfull and one has gone beyond fear.The rulers dont want that...p.s....the fools will laugh, but the wise will understand"
4,"Good, but could be better","I have revised my opinion of this work. It is quite solid with a good amount of analysis. It covers a lot of topics and it covers them well. I leave off a star for a variety of reasons which would make my rating 3 1/2 stars.1) The book is weak where Dr. Geisler is weak. As was shown in Chosen but Free, Dr. Geisler does not have a good grasp of Reformed theology. This weakness appears from time to time.2) It is not an encyclopedia. It is a collection of Dr. Geisler's notes. If he has problems with a position (Van Til comes to mind) he will let you know. I like that, but that does not seem in keeping with the spirit of an encyclopedia.3) As was mentioned earlier, this book desperately needs an index."
5,Great for a Christian Library,"This is a great resource to have on apologetics by a top apologeist. Dr. Norman Geisler should be a house hold name for Christians everywhere, and this book is something that is a must. I read this text on my drive to Ontario Canada from Los Angeles and I finished the text cover to cover. I read this text in 2001 and it was damaged in the winter of 2002. I need to replace it. It's a great book, and it goes through so many different apologetical issues. Woldviews, textual issues, cults and religions etc. Dr. Norman Geisler is one of thee top defender of Truth."
4,manure bedding fork,This is a very sturdy fork. The quality is excellant and it works very well. The only thing I don't like is the length of the handle. I should have researched this a little better. I am very short and the handle is way too long for me. I have to hold it halfway down the handle to be able to use it. However other than that I am very happy with it.
3,Just not enough to pass the test,"I've used a number of this Series of Books to pass my MCSE tests and CCNA, but this book just didn't cut it. I estimate that it was missing 30 percent of the questions asked on the test. I don't expect the book to cover everything possible for the test, but 70% of the information was completely unacceptable."
2,"Book is good reference, but useless to pass exam","I totally share my thoughts with the previous critics. I also miss the exam for 1 question.The test is quite bad, as on a few questions, I was wondering if I was taking the right test...This book is not a ""cram"" book. To my knowledge, there is no such thing out there for now...If you take the test, be ready to apply your pure logic and deduction to it. The book will not give you the answers."
1,I do not reccomend this book.....,"This book is well formatted, has plenty of useful information to keep you interested, and is a good source for Administrators to reference to help them through Citrix XP installs and troubleshooting. What it DOES NOT do is prepare you for the test.I have a good amount of experience with Citrix, enough to prompt me to take the test. This book with out question is not in parallel to what the test throws at you. If you read this book to prepare for the test, make sure you also read another book!!I would start with reading the PDF file that Citrix has on the download site for Citrix admin's then go from there."
3,Yanni/Nightbird,"Good, very good, but, not his best. As he has come along over the years, he has become one of our finest. This being an older recording shows the magic starting to happen. A good CD for any collection."
3,Lid a problem,"The pan is great and the lid was a real help, until it cracked! Now the lid is practically useless as it does not stay on tight, plus the crack keeps the pan from keeping cakes fresh.If I were to buy another cake pan with a lid, I would have to look elsewhere."
4,love it,"it is a cake pan with a lid how can you go wrong? It is a great pan does not scratch easily, The only complaint is the lid can pop off easily if you are not careful. Other then that it is a good pan."
4,"Extraordinarily vivid...a honest, chilling novel well told.","An impressive debut by Christopher Andrews. This dark, chilling tale of Alistaire Bachman, a wealthy, deeply religious vampire who is created by Neil Carpenter. Through hypnosis Neil assumes Alistaire's identity.A simple game that takes a evil turn.The scariest part of this horror tale is that it could be real. Too real.Read ""Pandora's Game"" with the lights ON!"
1,What are these people talking about?,"This is a amatuer book disguised as a ""real"" book. Anyone can write, all of us have at least one story in us, but to write it down is not enough. It must be crafted and refined. One must not only have a good idea but have a style, a voice and, if not an interesting thing to say, an interesting way of putting it. This book does not have any of this, for the exception of maybe a good ""basic"" story idea. It seems that the author actually said to himself, "" I've done a couple of drafts and now I am done."" It is said that some of the best, most celebrated writers in the world never feel (felt) ""done"" with their work and only would release their novels into the world after they exhausted all the creative artistry they possessed. - Sorry to the author of this book, and ""Dream Parlor"". If you wish to truly entertain and shine, you must re-evaluate why you write in the first place. [...] - Thank you for your time - Sorry for the typos."
4,Four to Score,"A few weeks ago I clicked on the icon for ""High Five"" by an author I had never heard about. All the reviews seem to say how good the plot was and how funny the book was. Since I hadn't heard of the author before I did what I usually do and find the earliest book by the author and start there. The early books are usually in paper back and cheaper. Generally an author develops characters along the way so that is what I did. I bought ""One For The Money"". Well I just loved it and quickly read 2 and 3 and am finishing ""Four To Score"". This is one of the funniest and most enjoyable series I have read. The only negative thing I have to say is that I have finally ordered ""High Five"" and when I am done I will have a long wait before the next novel comes out. If you havn't read any of the books I do recommend that you start from the beginning of the series and I hope you get as much enjoyment from them as I have."
5,Does she know funny?,I ENJOYED ALL THE LAUGHS. PENCIL DICK WAS HILARIOUS. CAN NOT WAIT TO READ THE NEXT BOOK. HOPE IT IS AS GOOD.
4,"Hilarious,dangerous and fun!","As always a fabulously funny,life endangering,i interesting new characters. A great continuation and fantastic to read the next book. A great read."
4,Decent read,"Fans of Lovecraft will have a good time with this book. It's par for the course as these sorts of collections go, nothing groundbreaking, but a nice way to spend a weekend. I found only maybe 1 or 2 stories not worth the trouble, and for the most part all the authors did a workmanlike job."
1,What on earth is this rubbish title?,"This title does not form part of the ""Gods"" series of films. It is in fact a 1993 film from South Africa called ""THERE'S A ZULU ON MY STOEP"" or ""YANKEE ZULU"". It is not a bad film at all, something like an SA version of the ""HOME ALONE"" series of films and does in fact star Leon Schuster and is directed by Gray Hofmeyr.Whoever thought up this title and thought that they could fool the public (especially me) should be frog-marched out and shot. Preferably with a cannon loaded with some bodily fluid."
3,"F55 Heart Rate Monitor - new strap is not for those with 40"" + chests","The strap that is included is different than my previous Polar heart rate monitor that this replaced. For whatever reason Polar chose, the strap is not replaceable as prior versions were; the battery pack snaps onto the strap, which does not allow a different strap to connect to it (the front is sewn into the part of the strap that goes around you).Although the fact that is is nice to see that the battery on the chest strap could be replaced, the strap, although indicating that it adjusts from M-XXL, was loosened it to the maximum size and it was still snug. I have a 40"" chest and if that is XXL, they won't sell many of these units with that chest strap.Watch = 5 starsStrap = 1 star"
1,All that hard work and can't use it.,"I've owned my F55 for about a year now and have been happy using it as an aid to keep me in the zone for my runs.. but that is about all this Polar unit is good for. If you start to advance and want to get all the hard earned data out of this device your stuck with Polar's anemic PolarPersonalTrainer web site.. It is NOT supported by the overly expensive ProTrainer5 software and to add insult to injury you cannot create .HRM files to import into more advanced training software (i.e. Training peaks, etc). The other problem I've had with this HRM is the band; it's difficult to put on and take off and doesn't have the ability to be replaced with a quick Velcro band.. All in all after a year of using this HRM and not being able to access my data I've finally given up on Polar, I'm going to move on to Garmin or Suunto. (Yes I'm willing to pay more to have a well engineered ""solution"" over pretty websites and fancy marketing buzz words.)"
2,Moving on,"I am not a fan of the F55. I have owned a Polar HRM on and off for 10 years, but I am moving on. This was the worst of the bunch. The controls are fidgety and unintuitive. The watch stopped working in about 1.5 years, and no its not the battery and not under warranty. I will look into other brands."
3,Good watch but not worth the full price,I purchased this watch 2 months ago. I had another polar before and although I paid almost the same amount of money for both of them the functionality on the F55 are too complex to use unless you really dedicate time to it. If you are a gym freak then it is the product for you. If not buy something simpler to use.
3,F55 HR Monitor Watch,"Good quality, works well in the pool and river. Lots of features. Disappointed with the preset programs. They are not changeable, so you are stuck with them. But you can work around it. Watch does not record all five HR zones, just Z2,Z3,Z4.For quailty I would buy Polar again, for triathlon training, I would get another style of Polar or other brand."
5,Praying With Julian of Norwich,This is a well written journey in understanding this Anchoress's life and showings! For anyone wanting a new way of understanding God...this is the book!
2,Really awful. Buggy software,"My girls ages 5 and 7 begged me for this software. I finally gave in even though the whole concept of creating fake finger nails did not appeal to me. They enjoyed the music selections that play while you create the nails which is the main reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1. The program comes with some sticker sheets which only contain one set of nails each and wastes tons and tons of printable space. I found it completely impossible to line up the paper so that the little squares would print in the correct spots! Extremely irritating! Once I got them somewhat lined up, the girls were very disappointed in the final product. It sparkles on the screen, not on the paper after all! My five year old will on occasion go in and make up some nails and listen to music, but she will be bored in about 10 minutes and on to another game."
4,Rueda Salsa,Gigi has managed to avoid using several annoying phrases that bugged me in the original Dirty Sala DVD set and this explanation of Rueda is an excellent introduction to the dance.
1,DONT BUY,"DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK! It has none if very little factual information within it. The entire book is an argument on how the Cherokee are dependents of one of the 12 tribes of Israel! It draws comparisons between the beliefs but that is all! ITS WORTHLESS! and worse off it was pure speculation. A Horrible Horrible book, I am shocked that it is being presented as a book on the beliefs of the Cherokee people. If you want some crazy theories and don't care about the actual beliefs of the Cherokee then by all means buy this book. But if you do want to actually learn about the Cherokee then you need to buy a different book. A waste of money and time"
3,Good Lens for the price,Nice lens at a reasonable price. The 50 - 200 mm lens becomes a second lens to carry. Would only need single lens with a ~30 - 200 MM lens.
5,Its a zoom lens.,"what else is there to say? it works pretty fast witn the K100D autofocus system and when using manually it is pretty smooth on both zoom and focus rings.As for photos, with SLRs what you see is what you get and I havent noticed any obscurities in the lens glass at all.comes with a front and back cap. I wish it came with a soft felt bag though."
4,The Pentax DA 50-200: a very good quality economy lens,Very good quality for the money. Not a fast lens but satisfactory when the camera can be supported or when light is plentiful. Build quality is also very good and all operations are smooth and precise. Nicely augments the 18-50 Pentax kit lens that came with my dslr. With a tele-converter and a tripod this lens becomes a nice medium-long telephoto. I recommend this for those with a limited bankroll and a willingness to utilize a tripod or a solid rock when in the quest for crisp photographic results.
3,This isn't Acquarium Rescue Unit,"I like Bruce. I like all stages of his work. The best stage of his work was with the Aquarium Rescue Unit. That is why I bought this CD. Now, the CD is OK. Just don't be fooled into believing (as I was) that there are any Aquarium Rescue Unit cuts on this CD. In reading liner notes, I found no references to Jimmy Herring, Jeff Sipe, or Oteil Burbrige. So, the title is quite decciving. Amazon should NOT call this Aquarium Rescue Unit. It is a good Bruce Hampton CD. That's all."
3,Very shiny crome,"I was dissapointed with this purchase since I feel the ring is cheap-looking, but in fairness I must admit it looks very much like the picture. The metal is very shiny so it's obvious it's not silver."
4,Bosch O2 sensor,Product as advertised and receive din a timely manner. I have not installed it yet to determine efficiency.
3,Beware of fitment due to Amazon's part matching,"Amazon's ""does this fit my car"" software contains errors. It said to use this sensor for the front O2 sensor on my 1996 Mazda Miata. Actually Bosch's own website says to use part 15733 for both the front and rear O2 sensors for my application. It's best to check with the Bosch website prior to ordering any sensors from Amazon. I had to send this part back."
1,confused,Instructions were not very good.I returned it and bought a Walker brandthat fit perfect and has done the job.
1,Bosch O2 Sensor,This part failed 3 times and had to be replaced. Only worked for about 5 minutes when I did get 1 tyo work. Had to get an OEM version and return all of these I got. I would not recommend this part.
2,No me funcionó,"No me funcionó para nada en mi vehículo Honda CR-V 2002, perdí mi US$ en la compra de este Sensor."
5,Exactly as advertised,"Not much to say for or against it. I received the product I expected, which was this oxygen sensor, and it arrived on time. I wired it correctly and it works. This went on a '94 Mazda Miata."
2,"Avoid this universal sensor, threads melt","I installed this sensor about 1 year ago. I went to check my exhaust manifold for some issues and needed to take out the O2 sensor it was plugged into. The thing wouldn't budge. When I finally got it out and inspected it the threads where completely melted and fused with the threads in the manifold. Luckily I had a 22 mm tap and die set to repair the threads in the manifold. Avoid this universal product, it is cheaply made. I found a Bosch OEM specific model on Amazon for only $5 more and that model had sturdier threads, just look around and avoid this sensor!"
1,wrong part,"the part was not for my car would have used it if I could, cost me $4.17 to send it back the part I had to use was $35 more than the one so all together it was $40 to get things straightened out lessen learned"
4,Well made little flashlight,"The flashlight is well made and solid. It throws a good amount of light. Personally I would rather the color wasn't so bright and I don't really like the pen clip, but they are exactly as pictured, so I can't really complain on these items, just not my preferences. It has a twist on switch and at least appears to be fairly waterproof. I'm not sure if it could be kept submerged, but I'm guessing a brief dunk in water would be no problem."
3,Traction Set,"A little cumbersome, but overall it works. Used stones for weights instead of water to be able to adjust it more easily."
5,Help for Prayer Life,For anyone learning to pray or looking to get closer to Ouf Heavenly Father I would recommend this book.My Father's Names: The Old Testament Names of God and How They Can Help You Know Him More Intimately
2,One speck of dust and its all over,"This product is fairly different than the Kitchen concept product that came out several years ago. Unlike the kithcen concept product, the Cleartouch is absolutely clear with no texture, however, you only get one sheet with your purchase. You are supposed to be able to remove it and wash it when it gets dirty.While following instructions on how to apply this protector a speck of dust landed on the sticky side of the film. Unfortunately when I tried to remove it got worse. Annoyed, I pulled off the protector took it to the sink and rinsed it off. I brought it back and tried it again and again and again. After five attempts to apply the product, three trips to the sink to rinse it off and an hour and a half of pure frustration I simply gave up and decided that I need to return this product.If you want to apply this product successfully, wear special gloves and lock yourself in an-anti dust chamber or microchip facility and it should go on fine."
3,Oh so trading isn't easily done?,"The writer basically shows his experience how trading is no piece of cake, and many are fooled into thinking it is. Most traders don't need to read a book like this after they have been trading for a few months.He also ""exposes"" the brokerage industry as an industry filled with coke addicts and innept jobs. Supposedly these people would snort coke while on the lines with customers. Well, excuse me I have not had a job as a broker, but I find it hard to believe it is filled with coke addicts any more than, say, accountants.All throughout the book while reading the revelations that trading is not easily mastered you must contend with a giant ego, and statements like, ""when I was a loser, I had no idea what I was doing. Now, I am a winner, and I do the right things.""He also takes a story out of Charles Le Beau's book, an incident that happened in the sixties. I have no idea if he met the same person an identical individual or he is making that up too."
3,Dancing with myself,"This book does what it promises - it describes how one man stopped and realized how different it feels to have positive vs. negative P/L given the same market action. This is not a bombshell, but is quite readable and entertaining.""Feel the other side of your trade"" is how this book could be summarized. Then there's a lot of ranting about brokerage business and a bit of self-aggrandizement - which takes away one star in my opinion. Oh, and he knows two ""100% win"" traders... :-)Also, it seems that mysterious ""Trader X"" is really not-so-mysterious J.A. Jankovsky - you can read his book or listen to him on CBOT website.So let's sink another drink'Cause it'll give me time to thinkIf I had the chanceI'd ask the world to danceAnd I'll be dancing with myself"
1,Don't buy it!,"Although there are quite no photos of this case in the Internet, I decided to give it a try thinking it would be a nice looking, easy to use case and a good way to protect my new DSC-H1. But I was completely disappointed when I put my hands onto it. This case has two parts, one (the ""base"") that gets attached to the DSC-H1 camera using a screw that fits into the tripod socket and another (the ""case"" itself) that gets attached to the first one. Once installed, the H1 which is a small and good looking camera, turns into a big strange thing. Closing and opening the case is a hard work. When closed, the case is completely ugly when seen from the bottom. When opened, you'll get a thick camera that's difficult to grab because of the ""base"" and with a big case hung underneath of it. taking pictures with the camera with the case attached is a very difficult and uncomfortable job. Don't buy it. There's a lot of cheaper, better looking and easy using cases around there."
4,Awesome Bluegrass Album,"Bought this album for my mother as a Christmas present. We had heard about the band and found out that we lived in the county referenced in ""He Walked All the Way Home"". The music is great. The sound quality is excellent."
5,Wonderful Bluegrass Music,This is a great group. Love their music. Would recommend to anyone who likes Bluegrass.
3,like,"i like these guys. though theyre not as traditional as i had hoped, they have many unfamiliar songs, and they perform with zeal."
3,putter was not printed,"The printing was not present on the putter... annoying, but not worth the hassle of shipping it back to the retailer..."
5,excellant,I stumbled across this book at a used book trade. As an avid reader of military books I would rate this as one of the best I've every owned. The research that was involved is apparent. Complements to the author
4,One of the top five best true books about The Vietnam War,"I found this book hard to put down. The flow of teh story was better that some fictional accounts of the war that I've read. I am a writer, and I would recommend this book for anyone wishing to use it as a reference."
3,"Same book at ""The Silent Rose"" by Kat Martin","This is the same book at ""The Silent Rose"" by Kat Martin. Apparently it was put out under her pen name first and now reprinted under her other name. It dealt with ghosts and the afterlife -- something I'm not a big fan of, so I didn't really like that. The characters weren't very honest with each other and that always bugs me. The love scenes were hot. Overall, an ok book.If you want an excellent modern romance by KM, read ""The Dream."""
1,Non-denatured wheys,This product would probably work great as a drywall patch product. It does not mixwith anything known to mankind. Total waste of money. Immunocal is far better product.
2,Don't get it,"I enjoyed the cornet playing of Don Cherry, although I wonder if the rest of the musician really know how to play. I just did not get this album. Improvisation has to have some discipline or it sounds like you don't know the music. I would recommend Ornette Coleman if your looking for free jazz."
1,Awful quality. Really awful,"I was expecting a cheap product (the price was right). But I was shocked at just how awful this was manufactured. The bits themselves, although clearly inexpensively made, seemed usable, and I wasn't looking for a heavy-duty industrial-grade product.But the packaging was unacceptable. Trying to extract each bit out of the case was like prying loose an evangelical from the Republican Party. (Darn near impossible!)Thankfully Amazon has a wonderful return policy."
2,be carefull,"the quality is great but almost every piece is repeated, so is really like 60 pieces + Replacement"
5,Very nice assortment,"I bought this item for husband for Christmas when he said, ""All I want are tools. Tools are to guys what toys are to kids."" He's already used them on many projects, and really like the set. Just enough assortment to be useful, not frustrating. Great value."
4,Good assortment at reasonable price,"Quite a few pieces for not a lot of money. Of course, that means they are probably not meant for heavy-duty commercial use. But for around the home it is fine."
1,Don't buy it!,"It looks nice on the picture, but it's impossible to assemble, too large, and it pushes the mattress down in a way that an adult cannot sit on it with the kid.When trying to work with babyage the customer service was the worst I've ever seen. They only gave me the option of having a store credit even though one of the rails arrived broken.DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT!Then we went to BrUs and got the summer double bed rail that is perfect and comes ready to install out of the box!What a waist of time and $ with this bedrail ... not SIMPLE at ALL"
5,"Very nice, held together for embossing and well perforated",Title says it all really. I didn't run into any problems embossing or using these. I like the peel and stick of this product MUCH more than the lickable type :)
2,"Good quality, but not what I expected","It is very heavy and appears to be good quality. There is nothing wrong with the item itself. It is hard to put into words, but this looks very different installed than what I expected. I was expecting it to look like other customized frames I see just a different pattern. This however is a flat piece of metal that sits flat against the plate. There is no depth or dimension. Other than the chrome, it looks like something you could make in shop class. It also blocks the tags at the bottom of the plates....perhaps leading to tickets depending on how zealous your local PD is on enforcement."
2,Cheap and crappy but it works.,I use this for pulling flywheels off of RCs. It works fine but its made very cheaply. On one particularly hard to remove flywheel I bent the turn shaft at the top. the whole thing is made out of cheap metal. For the price its being doing fine for now but next time around Ill get something made out of better stronger metal.
2,underwhelmed,"I was really hoping this would be great. I love Lemon anything if its done right. This wasn't. The crust and topping were both seemingly uncooked. The filling was decent but not really something i would just have to have again. It made for a gooey mess really. The crust couldn't hold the filling in place so when i got it the tin had been bent in on one side, despite the copious amount of packing peanuts included, and the filling had bunched up in the middle. All in all not something i would order again."
1,"Michael Mello has "" I "" trouble and I want a refund!!!!!!","The story of Joe Spaziano sounds like an interesting read. Outlaw biker convited of two heinous crimes and there's doubt about the crime for which he is sentenced to death. What SHOULD be a gripping account of the twists and turns of Capital Murder disintergrates into a lovefest--Michael Mello' Self Love and Admiration Society. The book is over 500 pages. If the word ""I"" were removed, the book would be about 25 pages. This reader wanted to know more about the facts; for instance what was the reason his FAMILY testified against him, why was he a suspect in an out-of state crime. The book is woefully short on facts on the case, and written in a breathless,""Aren't I wonderful and isn't Joe the second most fabulous human being on the earth (next to me, of course"" style. Long on pages, short on facts about the crime. No wonders lawyers get no respect."
3,Este CD,"Soy fanatica de los Iracundos desde siempre y este CD es bueno, no uno de los mejores pero vale la pena."
2,Not Reliable,"I no longer believe the stories of Sidis's precocity are true, much as I wish they were. He was an intelligent child, to be sure, but the important claims have little to support them. Some of the claims, such as his sister's declaration that he knew all the languages in the world, are clearly absurd. But even those which might just barely be true turn out to have only his parents as witnesses or are second- or thirdhand reports. Even the positive comments by the credible Norbert Wiener about Sidis's lecture on 4-dimensional bodies at Conant Hall are equivocal upon examination.Ms Wallace records the reports accurately but not skeptically. She wants to believe. So did I, which is perhaps why I am a bit harsh with her."
3,Prodigy,The book had been in a library. It had excessive Library attachments. No bent pages or earmarks or ink stains.
3,"Okay...Not vital, but not bad.","Call me a completist. I've tried to collect everything I can get my hands on related to the Diablo series of games, so I HAD to get this book. If you're looking for in-depth strategies for beating Baal, you might want to look elsewhere. There are a number of fine websites where you can find that. The problem with strategy guides for the Diablo series is the fact that most of the action is generated randomly. Diablo II is not a strictly linear game where every player will experience basically the same thing. That is a large part of the games' appeal. Personally, I like having a book that I can go relax with after spending a few hours going toe-to-toe with the forces of Evil. Try dragging your PC to bed with you! But seriously, the best thing about this book is the nice overview of the new Druid and Assassin character classes, especially their respective skill trees. Also, there are suggestions for leveling up these characters. Vital information, nah...Just a nice extra."
1,Very few useful pages.,"Most of this book is just a rehash of the Diablo II guide... did I really need 80 pages on the Diablo 2 classes, which everyone is already familiar with? A pitiful walkthrough as well. How about some ideas on how to beat those annoying demon imps? Nope.Tons of errors as the other reviewers pointed out. A real waste."
2,MOOSE,"This guide is like any guide to a game, it has information about the 2 new classes and about the classes pros and cons and a lot more of course. It can be very useful in the begging until Bilzzard starts makeing patches. However if you only play single player and dont upgrade your game this guide is fine."
2,Finger Puppet Barn Animals Barnyard Knuckleheads,Useful for telling stories to little children using any barynard book for a theme. A little expenisve. Hard to find finger puppets.
4,For Those Who Have Never Written for Publication,"I purchased this book as required reading for a doctoral program. Iles takes you from the simple to the complex in a very easy to read format. The book is simple; Iles practice what he teaches. He provides plenty of examples and step-by-step instructions as the subtitle states.The book in not just about the basics of medical writing; Iles shares his insights into selecting journals and how to work with the editors. The ""Guidebook To Better Medical Writing"" provides lots of how-tos, but more importantly it provides a lot of valuable what not to dos. Iles' advice is combined with the encouragement that every novice medical writer needs.This is a perfect 'starter' book because of its simple and concise nature. I suspect it will be my constant companion as I venture into the medical writing world."
4,Guidebook to Better Medical Writing,"Simple explanations on tips to improve writing. At first glance I thought it was almost too juvenile; but the book did get the message across in simple terms, which actaully did help in the application of those tips. Very inexpensive for it's value."
5,Guidebook to Better Medical Writing,"This a very friendly, and yet, powerful book that allows the reader to review basics of grammar, punctuation, spelling, and general writing rules."
4,A bit too elementary,"A good deal of what this book covers should already be known to a professional writer. That said, the book reminds the writer about the special characteristics of medical writing."
2,Asimov did it better,"The format of this book is patterned after Isaac Asimov's Treasury of Humor, a short paragraph establishing a joke or anecdote with the punchline indented below in bold face. Unfortunately, most of the anecdotes also seem to be borrowed from Asimov's treasury as well as its sequel, Asimov Laughs Again, and Dr. Grothe almost uniformly chooses the most well-known, least amusing witticisms for his book. Added to this fact is Dr. Grothe's tendency to talk down to his readers and laboriously explain why a joke is funny. Bill Watterson wrote once that the essence of humor is surprise, and there are very few surprises in Viva La Repartee."
3,Geeky Choice,"This book has specific target audience that will be your geeky Girl Friend or perfect gift for your literature professor father-in-law or if you are in that age range .That is specific target audience as every one liner is accompanied by 7 lines of history behind it,Like at what time it was quoted and stuff....People who like history genre will definitely like it but ordinary HBO,Comedy Central nation will prefer other quick joke books .So Choose this book if you belong to talented audience but avoid if you want quick quirks ."
4,Viva La Repartee,"Amusing and clever, a compilation of quotes by famous wordsmiths and some anonymous sources as well. Not guaranteed to make you wittier, but definately worth reading!"
5,Moving and memorable poetry,"The poems of Sybil Estess' BLUE, CANDLED IN JANUARY SUN are subtle evocations of all the kinds of love and friendship that can be experienced. The allusive, emotionally vibrant scenes she evokes make the reader look at her or his own experiences with new eyes. Many Texas scenes come alive in this collection, as well as vignettes of other places. Everything Estess views is touched with transcendence and with a desire for social justice. These are compassionate and lucent poems."
2,Lots of Life...,"Well, this book has many different types of marine life. Everything from sea lions to sea horses, but many of the patterns are unattractive, really. They are sized for immediate use, which is refreshing becasue so many pattern books give you itty bitty patterns and they you have to run to the copy shop, so that is one plus. But if you are looking for cool tropical fish scenes like I was, this is not the book for you. Too many boring and bland patterns of strang looking star fish and sharks, and many other peculiar animals which just don't translate well to glass."
3,First Order,This was the first order I've place for a stained glass pattern book. I was disappointed not to see any of the pages in color. Even though one would choose their own colors a review of some contrast would have be helpful.
4,Great Book,This book is full of wonderful patterns! It is perfect for those who wish to use the individual fish and sea life patterns to create entire sea scenes or to use the scenes that the author has created for you. I also found the patterns easy to manipulate into simpler designs for those that are new at the art of stained glass. I definately recomind this book.
4,Great Post-Potter Read,"After finishing the Potter series with my 7-yr old, he had developed the ability to listen for long periods of time without pictures. Looking for another adventure book written through the eyes of a younger person, I found Children of the Lamp at the library. I liked the interesting facts woven into the story and the settings which were exotic. He liked the djinn's powers and hearing about how the bad guys were cleverly defeated. We are both looking forward to the next in the series."
1,One-dimensional and plodding,"I had high hopes for the book's premise --- twins who discover they're djinn (genies). And it's clear that the author spent a great deal of time working out the detail of the djinn world and the rules by which it operates. If only he'd spent a minute or two thinking about his characters and what makes them tick. The book is a plot-driven mess. Throughout the story, the young protagonists are uprooted from a mundane life in New York City, travel to distant places, face unprecedented dangers, possible eternal confinement in a bottle and witness brutality and death. But neither ever misses home, feels overwrought or ambivalent about their djinn status? Or maybe they did because actually at no point did I have a clue how either of them felt about anything. The book reads like a cartoon, with gags and one-liners, but no feeling, no heart. I didn't care a whit about any of the characters. I can't un-recommend it enough."
2,Good Idea....Bad Book,"Children of the lamp # 1 wasn't a very good book. It was a good idea for a book series, but the book was written in a slow way, and I was more than half way through before I got to an exciting part. There was a very interesting explanation about genies and magic, and in the beginning it seemed like it was going to be a great book. Though, there was one pretty funny part. I can't say the whole series was bad, because after the first one I didn't read any more in the series."
4,4.5 to be exact : Almost perfect,"I got this at a book fair and I liked it a lot. Very interesting plot, great characters. But do all kids in books have to be rich or have a fortune? I just wish that they're was more diversity. But I still think this is a great book. Another flaw is that it dragged a little bit in the middle, but it smoothed down to the end. I reccomend this to anyone who likes adventure. I for one, will buy more from this series."
3,From an adult's perspective,"I enjoyed this book and will read the sequel(s). However, not quite as good as some young reader's fantasy books (i.e. Harry Potter, The Compass, etc.) so I decided not to keep it until my daughter is old enough to enjoy it-resold it on Amazon. I would suggest give it a try."
1,Waste of Reading Time,This is a book meant to be enjoyed by children under the age of 10. Young teens and adult readers will be disapointed. Wish I never wasted the time of day reading it. Glad it was borrowed from the library and not purchased or I'd demand my money back!
2,Children's Librarian Point of view,"This book is not appropriate for elementary children. I found that it encouraged smoking and sexist attitude. The language and situations was too high for children 12 and under at our current level of education. Parents PLEASE be aware of the content of the books you allow your kids to read. This is better then some ""kids"" books but you can tell this was a first attempt by an adult author to write a children's book.This book is not as bad on the teen level. Their education and understanding should allow them to enjoy the book overall. For adults it is a nice read with some enjoyment.I do NOT recommend this for children waiting for Harry Potter 6. I think it is an ok read for Adults waiting for HP6."
3,Children of the Lamp,"My cousin had it so I borrowed it. To tell the truth I liked Kingdoms and the Elves of the Reach, Amulet of Samarkand, and the other stories it triest to be like (like Harry Potter) much better. I don't think I'll read the second one even if my cousin gives it to me."
5,It's Magic,"We read this book aloud as a family. It is such a wonderful way to redirect our thoughts on the subject of Akhenaten. We usually spend more time on his wife--- Nefertiti, and his son- Tut. This book appealed to our eight year old daughters sense of adventure, and the possiblities of magic. She loved all the characters, especially, NIMROD. We can only hope that P.B. Kerr will choose other dynastic persons for future adventures with John and Phillipa."
1,Not Very Good,"To be short, I thought this book was TERRIBLE. It dragged on, didn't make much sense, and has a dreary theme. I really DO NOT recommend this to people who aren't into ancient Egypt."
5,The Power of the Djinn,"Twelve-year-old John and Philippa Gaunt are extraordinary twins. They have powers to appear and disappear, capsulate themselves in lamps, and... grant wishes! How? They are djinn!! They journey to defeat the evil djinn and search for the lost djinn of Akhenaten.I really love this book because it has a theme that means a lot to me. The theme is : you are better off with your sibling(s) than you are without your sibling(s). This was revealed when the twins played Tesserae (a dice game). However, I found the plot was a little slow. There was too much talking at the beginning for an action seeker like me!"
5,Kiana's Rave Review,I think that anyone that likes adventure books should read Children of the Lamp. I myself personally think that the book should get an award because it was one of the best I ever read. I think the author is telling people that they are special and that people are. On a scale of 1 out of 10 I would give this book 10 and all the other books a 7.This book helped me learn about Egypt and Arabian things and also a little French.I hope you read all the adventures locked inside this book. This book made me think that there might be actual djinn in the world .More importantly I hope a lot of kids read this very interesting story. aia really hope that P.B KERR makes more books. That is my theory on the book.
3,Am I the only person...,"Who noticed the odd name of a ""perfume"" in the book: Air d'Onajeestring?Now, sound it out...Ah."
2,Has Jinn...Needs Tonic...,"First volume in the Children of the Lamp series. An interesting and fresh take on the 'genie of the lamp' genre and younger readers will no doubt enjoy it. Adult readers who enjoy such offerings as the Harry Potter books and Series of Unfortunate Events will be left wondering where the rest of the story is.The author takes very clever ideas, such as the whole concept of kids who are half jinn and half human, wishes and TV loving dogs; interesting characters and places both in a very linear plot.I will check out volume 2 just to see if the author takes off after stretching their limbs with the first book."
4,M moneys reviews,"The book The Children of the Lamp was an exciting story. It had a good plot and an exciting resolution. I think that P.B. Kerr did an excellent job in writing this book. I really enjoyed it.My favorite part in the book, was when John, Phillipa, and their Uncle Nimrod went to the musuem to try and steal the scepter that contained the seventy lost djinn. It was a very exciting part in the rising action. This story is filled with many twists and turns in the plot. I reccomend this book for anyone who enjoys to read adventure books."
5,"A ""fabulongoshoomarvelishlywonderpipical"" book!!","This is the first ""novel"" I read with my 7-year-old daughter. We had such a blast reading it and found it was hard to stop even when it was way past her bedtime.It was so exciting, and because my daughter has a younger brother, it was a great lesson on how siblings should stick together like John and Philippa did. I also loved that it introduced my daughter to some pretty big words - I'd like to think the side benefit to having read this is that her vocabulary is now improved.We would recommend it for anyone and were very sad to come to the last page!!"
5,Really cool book,"I was so excited when I first saw this book because I wanted the songs from sleeping beauty.It's a little bit harder than what I had guessed but that's good, It'll give me a challenge. The full list of songs that appear in the book are: BelleCan You Feel The Love TonightColors of the WindA Dream Is a Wish Your Heart MakesForget About LoveHail to the Princess Aurora/Sleeping BeautyHomeI Won't Say (I'm In Love)I Wonder, I'm Wishing/One SongIf I Can't Love HerJust Around The Riverbend, Kiss The GirlLove Once Upon A DreamOut Of Thin AirPart Of Your WorldReflectionSo This Is Love (The Cinderella Waltz)Some Day My Prince Will ComeSomething ThereThere's Only One ArielA Whole New WorldWith A Smile and a SongA few of the songs included are from the broadway Beauty In The Beast which is pretty cool. There's even a song from Robin Hood! Either way this was a extremely good buy for the price. I totally reccomend it!"
5,Great for advanced beginners and up!,"Buying music on-line can be tricky if you can't see the actual product. I would consider this a level 3 book. I've been playing for a few years and currently working out of a level 5 book, so for me the arrangements are a lot of fun. I think anyone who loves the music from the Disney films will love to be able to play these pieces. My favorite is ""If I Can't Love Her"", from Beauty and the Beast the Musical. It's such a great arrangement that I play it like I'm a rock star! A rock star or the Phantom of the Opera! It's fun!The only down side is that it is the ""big note"" edition which means that the notes are really easy to read, but the music takes up more space and means a lot of page turning."
3,Not exactly what I'd hoped for . . .,"Having grandgirls who are besotted with Disney princesses, I was hoping this book would be an updated version of a much older Disney songbook beloved of my now grown kids as well as the grandchildren. That volume has lots of cartoon pictures on each page, and music is condensed to fit on 2 pages per song. The new book has no pictures, other than on the covers, and the music is printed so large that excessive page turning is needed to play many of the songs. So, it's not nearly as much fun to share with the little girls. That said, the song selections are great and the music settings are very complete."
2,Do NOT buy for Musical Theatre purposes!!,"I bought this book because i thought i could use some of the songs in my musical theatre repitiore, and ten dollars seemed a pretty cheap deal. Bought when i opened it up i realized that it had ENORMOUSLY BIG PRINT and was made for little kids who were learning piano. The accompaniment, if you could even call it that, is very basic and would not pass at any professional audition. Its partly my fault, i think somewhere in the description it says that it has big or easy to read font. If i had known that i wouldnt have bought it. For little kids only!"
3,It's not too bad,"Being a Jackson fan, I just had to get this album to add to my collection. Although I got this CD a few years ago, I'm just now reviewing it. It's not too bad at all. I think this is one of his better CD's that I've heard."
2,""" F if for Format ""","To say that this is the most convoluted, haphazard and annoying book to read is an understatement. Talk about being all over the place and offering single lines and partial thoughts about a whole host of operas & related topics without ever getting to anything more substantial... And yet the photographs are good as are some of the one liners every now and again, such as when Marilyn Horne wonders aloud why everyone if focusing on Carmen's appearance instead of on her singing. Nice also is the inclusion of singers which I had little or no previous knowledge of from the 1950s at the NYCO and other venues. Glad I only paid under a dollar for a used copy in excellent condition, or I might have felt robbed. *JTQ"
3,No Extras Means No Perfect Score,"This is one of the best series ever on TV. I watch this DVD all the time and it still cracks me up. Sadly, Fred Berry died last year, robbing the world of the character Rerun.It would've been great to have some extras thrown in, and because none were, I have to give it three stars."
5,What's Happening On DVD!,Wow! what a funny show.I watched this show for years and I'm happy to see a DVD run in it's future.Funny cast and funny scripts makes this one of my favorite sitcoms of all-time.R.I.P. ( Re-Run )Fred Berry.
5,Excellent! Don't Miss Out.,"The latest DVD release of the first season of ""What's Happening"" is well worth the wait. The three disc set comes in an attractive package and includes a very handy insert with descriptions of all of the episodes. The quality of the DVD is good and it is just awesome to see all of those classic episodes packaged together. This is a great compilation and if you are a fan of ""What's Happening"" you will be pleased. This is not some shabby thrown together compilation. The appealing packaging and quality of the DVD makes this a good investment. Oh yeah, the classic opening is on the disc before each episode. Don't miss out. I will be waiting for the second season to come out too."
5,YES!!! FINALLY!,"This has to be the greatest and most classic non-animated show ever to be on TV. I mean, let's face it TV these days is pretty pathetic with the exception of The Simpsons, King Of The Hill, and Family Guy which was unfortunately cancelled well before its time.But What's Happening was a fantastic show with some of the greatest characters ever! It's hard not to smile just thinking about some of the greatest moments on that show.I just hope the DVD has some good extras. I would love to see some recent interviews with the cast to see what they are up to and what has become of them since the show (except for Fred ""Rerun"" Barry, God rest his soul).Either way, this classic TV show is worth having in any comedy lover's collection."
2,Patients are better.,This book is way too dense for medical school. It's like being pimped except that you won't remember the information after you read it. Seeing a patient with any of these conditions and going through their management with an attending is much more useful. Amazon is great for returns though!
4,Soft But Less Than Generous in Size,The full size sheets barely fit over the mattress and pad but are adequate. The material is incredibly soft and has a beautiful sheen that didn't suffer from the first washing.
4,Nice pillow cases,I got these standard pillow cases to match the white satin sheets/king pillow cases I received for my cal king bed. They matched perfectly and they are very nice. I highly recommend them.
1,What were they thinking??,"I have NEVER in all my days bought satin sheets and had only ONE side be satin. Not only is the other side not satin, it's actually ROUGH. With as much as these are, that is ridiculous and a rip off. My other satin sheets cost half the price and are WAY better. Both sides are exactly the same silky texture. Not to mention because of the large difference in texture on each side, the shade of color is affected by it and the sides don't match."
3,"Feel great, but...","I bought a set of these satin sheets in twin size for my 3 year old grandson who has a sensory disorder and has ultra sensitive skin. Since he loves these ""silky"" sheets, I think they are serving the purpose. But the product I received doesn't seem to be the product I ordered. The product I received has care instructions that include ""Dry Clean Only"" even thought the product description on Amazon states they are washable. I discovered this AFTER I washed and dried the sheets. Good news is they survived the first washing just fine and did not need ironing. The sheets are oversized, so if they shrank it wasn't too much. Finally, the quality of stitching was not great. So I'm concerned these sheets that are not stitched well and are supposed to be dry cleaned won't last very long. Only time will tell. But in the meantime, my grandson is loving them."
2,Poor quality,"Bought these sheets to go on my new queen size bed. I ripped one of the pillowcases putting it on a pillow, and the flat sheet is only one sided. The side that would seem to go against your skin is actually quite rough compared to the topside. Save your cash, don't buy these."
4,Very soft and slippery...,"I have never slept on satin before now. I must be honest and admit that i dont really like it. I can see how others would love these sheets as they are extremely soft and seem to be of good quality. They fit my king size bed perfectly and look great. However i think cotton is better for me since satin is so slipery, the top sheet seems to wander all over the pace at night. Too slippery for me.."
2,not worth the price,"These sheets are just ok, not worth the $99 price tag. They look and feel like a $20 to $30 set of sheets. The satin is very thin and they are not sewn well. I have had several sets of satin sheets over the years and these are definately on the lower end of the quality spectrum. I'll be surprised if they last more than a couple of times in the washing machine. Dont' waste your money on these sheets."
2,early reality vs. illusion,"The Cosmic Puppets starts with a promising idea, that of a man returning to his town of birth to find that in this world he died in infancy. All right. The novel (if it indeed qualifies length-wise) is a mystery/thriller in the first half. The 'Wanderers' turn out to be the real people, and this is a good interpretation of the common plot device, ie. ghosts. When the protag. and his friend (I forget their names) try to turn things back to normal, Cosmic Puppets seems a little like a precursor to Ubik, what with the layers of reality visible in a physical sense. At this stage, Cosmic Puppets is quite tolerable.But then the ending! It's awful. Terrible. Enought to stop you from reading. It all falls apart. Cosmic Puppets is an early PKD novel, and it shows. But it also shows in simple form the themes that PKD would pursue later.Only a PKD fan would find anything of interest, however."
2,2 stars but read it anyway,"This was the first science fiction I ever read: many, many books ago! It is probably only interesting to the fan of Philip K. Dick. Having said that, it really is fun, in its own way. All the Dickian issues are there: What is the nature of reality; do we really know what is going on; the man caught in the middle of realities in flux; the wife/girlfriend as super unsupporting person, etc. If you want to read all of PKD's stuff, find this and read it. Otherwise, it is only marginally interesting."
3,First incarnation of the grand theme,"Anybody who knows Philip K. Dick knows that most of his writing constitutes something of a quest to probe the nature of reality. 'The Cosmic Puppets' is where it all began.Ted Barton is the seminal Dick protagonist, drifting cynically between earth-shattering events, estranged wives and dark-haired girls, with only slightly more than a casual regard for anything secondary to his central motivation - truth.Unfortunately it took PKD twenty years (and quite a few short stories and minor novels) before he finally reached his epiphany with 'A Scanner Darkly'. 'The Cosmic Puppets' lacks the literary impact, depth of character and cohesion (Dick did have his own peculiar sense of cohesion)that would later convey Dick's real ambition. However, this book remains a useful starting point for anyone captivated by this brilliant man's unique imagination."
4,Ruark ramblings,"This book perhaps contains the cream of the crop, utilizing pieces of other works. If you have no other work of Ruark's, you would enjoy this one. The best part for me was a small section of magazine articles (not footnoted as to actual date and publication) that I haven't found elsewhere.Its easy to put yourself alongside the fire with Bob as you read, look through his eyes, and feel the bite of thorns, and the pride in shooting well, and the reward of matching wits with Mbogo."
5,Great book,"This book basically told the story of Lisa's life, from her childhood, to acting, and then about her marriage and parenthood. The chapters were well broken down into various aspects of her life, with her telling us what God has taught her at the end of each chapter. I loved the humor in the book, especially the words of wisdom from Lisa's mother."
5,"I'm Not a Reader, Yet...","Honestly, I skim through books and don't consider myself an avid reader. I look for the highlights on each page, but this book...this book was so entertaining and so inspiring that I had to read it slowly. I love Lisa Whelchel!!! She encourages all to look deep inside and upward to our heavenly Father with trust. I love her honesty and highly recommend this book to everyone! A+ in my book!"
3,the sack is back,"the shipping time was good, i got it a little earlier than expected. It came in a diffrent design than shown, im not complaining just dont expect to get the one in the picture, it looks hand stiched to me, (either that or the machine did a really bad job) and came with a tag saying made in guatamala 100% cotton. ill be glad to see what i can do with it. oh and it smells good.the beads will fall out though"
1,BOO!!,"Terrible bag, it got a little wet the first day i got it, and its already losing/leaking beads. I'm quite mad about that, but i bought a sand/dirt foot-bag instead and prefer those over bead bags. There a little more expensive then these ones but well worth it."
2,"Feels like it has a plastic bag inside, not soft at all. Bad quality.","Like the title says it plainly, it feels weird, like there's literally a thick plastic bag in the inside, also, it's not made with quality, so it starts to open up rather quickly, I'm thinking that's the reason for the plastic bag inside. Also, weird assorted colors. Mine came with the colors of the Gay Pride flag, so yes it's kind of awkward.Want a good hacky sack? Buy one made with sand instead of beans.Just an honest opinion. Cheers!"
4,Solid body guitar construction,"I purchased what were described as the three best books on the market to aid in solid body electric guitar construction. Hiscock's book was by far the best, very informative, lots of detail. It doesn't meet the standard of Benedetto's book on archtop construction, or the Cumpiano/Solomon book on acoustics but it is still the best on electrics. It just takes lots of reading and thinking to learn what you need to know from this book."
3,Make your own electric guitar,"This is quite an informative book for a beginner electric guitar or other electric instrument maker. There are three chapters which follow the course of making two guitars and a bass, and different neck/ body constructions are covered pretty well through these instructional examples. Different techniques for different applications are examined. I think the structure could be more logical and progressive for this book, but it's not a major detraction. I think that there could be a more fundamental analysis of constructing a guitar rather than basing the work on traditional and contemporary practices. In this way guitar makers could come up with there own ideas and approaches, but overall it's a good book in a subject area that seems pretty scant for want of information. Also sometimes the author is a little misleading for the sake of telling a joke, for instance about 'bashing in' frets. It could be edited better."
2,this book is useless,"if you have never built a guitar before, do not get this book. this book does not tell you how to build a guitar, it is just a book of tips on building a guitar. there are no steps and everything is out of order. first it tells you how to install a truss rod, then it tells you how to install frets, then it tells you how to build a neck, then it tells you how to put the neck on the body, then it tells you how to the body is made in 3 different ways. the whole thing is out of order and confusing, i am very disappointed."
4,good coupled with martin koch's book,"The book is somewhat jumbled, but still has a wealth of information, he discourages certain things to quickly like making a Flying V for your first guitar but does offer an array of resources such as Luthier suppliers in the UK, AUSTRALIA and US as well as some very useful templates.His book coupled with Matrin Koch's should be all you need but Koch's writing seems more impartial and easier to apply within the chronologically process of making your dream axe, All in all worth having with some exstensive historical insight into the birth of our beloved electric guitar."
4,Good But Could have been better,this book is good but could have been alot more presise i wanted a book that told me what i needed to do. a book that had specifics this was not really it.
2,Not worth the trouble,"Acoustic dampening kind of works but little better than orange foam or cork board. Whats worse is the smell, a cross between peppermint and a chemical spill...definately nauxious in an enclosed room. It has been more than a month and it still stinks up whatever room I put it in. If you have a nose on your face, your ears won't care the slight noise reduction. A towel or cork board worked much better for my situation."
4,Works,Not too much to review... It absorbs sound at it is supposed to. Good material... Just don't let a dog pee on it cause the stink cannot be removed and your studio will really smell... lol
3,FOAM,"It is what it is. I was not interested in the acoustical properties, but it suited my purpose just fine (re-purposing a violin case actually). Shipped quickly, but the shipping costs were a bit high."
1,the perfect title for this bit of self-indulgent madness,"If one reads this, they might do it with one of those foam collars about their necks that people use for whiplash, because that is precisely how you will feel when you finish this work. It's not bad enough the writer gets SO many facts wrong, out of order or does about faces on her own statement - it's a marathon of WRONG - she actually and consistently contradicts herself! One can write a small book on the errors this author carelessly makes.Take this as TOTAL FICTION and you MIGHT enjoy it. If you are looking for a feel for the period, look elsewhere. Save your money - and the headache! To see a writer do so much research and get it ALL so wrong, jumping around in chronological order with the consistency of a ping pong ball, had to be a fine madness.I don't think someone could deliberately set out to get something so wrong and do half a thorough job as Murray did."
1,Shoddy Fluff,"If it were possible to give this book half a star I would. The book is fluff. It would be an enjoyable time waster if it were not supposed to be fact. The chapters are littered with errors of fact, misidentified people,mistaken identies,and misdated events. There is a general absent of dates. None of these deficinecies would matter if this were a work of fiction. Unfortunately the book is promoted as non-fiction. If all you want is a cotton candy introduction to a fascinating period of English history, this book will do as well as any other novel; however, if you want a solid meal of fact, look elsewhere. It is a shame for the book is easy to read."
3,Gossipy account of high society in the Regency era.,"Serious historians won't find much to peak their interest in this gossip-ladden review of the Regency period, but lay readers will find it an interesting and entertaining read. The research supposedly comes from original sources, including newspaper columns about the foibles and follies of the haute ton. Admist the many amusing anecdotes, the author tries to cover all aspects of daily living in England at the time. Unfortunately, the structure of the book is such that there is a lot of repetition and I had trouble keeping track of (and interested in) the various many members of society that kept reappearing. An amusing read, but not a definitive look at the era."
1,A poorly researched book,"I hate to be cruel, but I think 'An Elegant Madness' is a truly shoddy book. It seems to have been written with no other purpose than to cash in on the popularity of the Regency period. It is not scholarly, it is not acurate, it is not even well-written. In fact, I think Venetia Murray gives a bad name to amateur historians. Her book is so second-rate that she makes the kind of general reader who likes reading social history look foolish for doing so. I am sorry to say this but it makes me angry to see a wonderful subject brought low by an ignorant journalist."
3,A Trial To Read,"I so wanted to fall in love with Murray's ""An Elegant Madness"" because I adore the Regency era. However, I was sorely disappointed.Tediously long paragraphs and excessive info dumps left me struggling to finish the book. I normally read a book in 2-3 hours. This one took me three months of forcing myself to pick it up and read a bit more. To be fair, I did find some useful information, but a great deal more was simply uninspiring and had me skimming pages."
4,Couldn't tear myself away,"There were parts that seemed a bit suspect as I read, but I didn't realize how inaccurate it was until I read these reviews here. Still, the book was quite entertaining so if you want to read it more as a work of historical fiction, then that's what I suggest. I recommend this as a source of entertainment rather than a source of information and as a source of entertainment it's very good."
4,New Years Fun,"This movie was made back in 1998 about a group of 20 somethings in new york trying to get through new years eve in 1999 going into a new millenium. The film succeeds where 200 cigarette's didn't quite pull it off as far as new years movies go. Noteable performances by Amanda Peet who you will know from ""Saving Silverman"" and ""The Whole Nine Yards"" also a great performance from one of my all time favourite comedians ""Steven Wright"" Showing he can still perform with the best of them. This is a definite happy romantic fun night in movie at a very reasonable price... check it out!"
4,Party like it's 1999,"This movie was never released at the cinema or on video so the only place you can get it is right here on dvd. Amanda Peet has a big role in this film and if you're a fan of hers the film is worth getting for her performance alone. The quality isn't perfect but it gives it that nice indy film vibe. If the movie wasn't already good enough the dvd has many extra features such as a hillarious Introduction by the director, Commentary and deleted scenes... all in all a great dvd check it out!"
1,Terrible,"I bought this movie for one reason only- Timothy Olyphant. I'm a big fan. Even his beautiful face couldn't keep me engaged. This movie is horrible- bad lighting, bad sound, bad plot, bad dialog, terrible camera work and my gosh was it BORING. I didn't laugh, I didn't feel any sort of emotion towards the characters. Didn't know much about any of them and didn't much care to. If you, too, are thinking of buying it only for Mr. Olyphant save your money. He's in it for a few moments and, as sad as it is to say, his performance contributes nothing. I was hoping both Garner and Peet would make the parts without Olyphant entertaining, but the suck was distributed evenly throughout the film. I'd feel jilted had I rented it. I'd probably go so far as to want my time back had I watched it free on television."
2,Boooooring!,"The only reason why I finished watching this movie it is because I bought it, but if I knew it would keep being so boring I would have not lost my time on top of losing my money...This is the boring version of the tv show ""friends"". It is the real boring version. There is nothing wrong with the actors or the acting but the plot is as lame as it can get.It seems like a bunch of people got together and tried to show us that they can act, which is true, they actually can, the cast was good but the story, what was the story, I don't think I have figured it out, and neither in my opinion did anybody behind this movie....Save your money!! don't buy it and don't rent it.....One star goes to Amanda Peet, and the other one to Sandrine...."
5,"Superb Review, Even For Us Laypersons","I am not a religious scholar, but I do enjoy reading a religious book on occasion. Father Brown's overview of the New Testament is fantastic, and should be read by all persons who consider themselves to be a Christian to better understand the New Testament. Father Brown will be sorely missed for his outstanding books."
1,Not Impressed,"Father Brown's style of biblical commentary is so speculative that his conclusions are always very questionable. His strong use of 'internal evidence' further weakens what he has to say as the use of said evidence has no real weight. His conclusions sound as if there is no room for another point of view, yet, as I have said the speculative nature of his scholarship does not lend itself to the kind authoritative conclusions that he comes to."
5,Access the New Testament on a whole new level.,"Great for personal study and introductory research. This book should not be limited to academics alone. Provides background on the origin of the New Testament books, guides to a deeper appreciation of the NT, background info on the history and ideas surrounding the NT writers, and an analysis with various notes for each book. This book is filled with bibliographies for deeper studies, so it provides a perfect access point for deeper, lengthier studies."
5,Give us a new way to study New Testament,This is the best N.T. Introduction in the World. Father Brown give me and my classmates a new way to study New Testament. I hope more Chinese Christian Scholars to read this book and improve their Bible knowledge.
5,The reference book for the NT,"Excellent, concise and perfect for anyone having questions or just wants to learn more about the New Testament."
3,religious,Don't expect to become a bible scholar but this book gives a lot of assistance for those that be interested in studying the bible.
5,Great resource book,This is a great introductory book on the New Testament and a great reference book to anyone who decides to pick up the Bible and read without someone to help them interpret it correctly.
5,Scholarly and Up to Date,"Raymond Brown's An Introduction to the New Testament is an outstanding example of contemporary Catholic New Testament scholarship. It covers just about everything you need to know, such as textual issues, basic history of the NT period, biblical interpretation, and the culture of first century Palestine.Brown takes takes the standard positions on most issues of dating and authorship of the New Testament books, so if you want to know, e.g., why most scholars reject Pauline authorship of the Pastorals, you will find it here."
5,A Ph.D. Student's Perspective,"I was assigned Brown's introduction to the NT in my Ph.D. program in New Testament. I read the book thoroughly from cover to cover and wrote a 46 page outline of it. Several key features stuck out at me: (1) Brown recognizes only 5 undisputed letters of Paul, (2) He identifies Marcan source and Q along the lines of the Two-Source Hypothesis, (3) He write from a Roman Catholic perspective but fairly evaluates the evidence. Overall it is an excellent textbook which is very readable. I like the chapters which have a one page summary of an entire NT book--a very helpful feature.David Ritsema"
4,A noteworthy book by a brilliant scholar.,"Both the Church and the Academy have desparatly needed an introduction to the New Testament which was both balanced in its approach and thoroughly academic. Thus, academics and laypersons alike will benefit from this outstanding contribution by the late Fr. Brown.Fr. Brown approaches the New Testament from a balanced perspective, acknowledging the various scholarly opinions and controversies inherent in biblical criticism, while at the same time retaining a great love for the text as the Word of God.I particularly appreciated the fact that if Fr. Brown was unsure about his position on an issue, for instance, regarding the authorship or dating of a book, he was willing to say so! What a refreshing lack of academic hubris!This book is suitable for use as an upper division undergraduate theology text, as a graduate level introduction, or as a seminary text."
5,Fantastic,"The best introduction to the New Testament on the market, hands down, maybe the best ever. A must-have for scholars, students of all levels and any English speaker who wants to know about the New Testament."
5,Air Supply rocks,"I can't get enough of Russell's voice. This is a great CD. Songs like Where Did the Feeling Go, Daybreak, Without You, Unchained Melody and Always are wonderful. I play it over and over and never get tired of it."
2,Pouring spout doesn't work properly,"I should have read the reviews more carefully. I don't care about how loose the lid is, I don't mind taking it off and didn't expect it to be a tight seal. But my problem is I loose a lot of liquid down the side and onto my counter when pouring. Even if I take the lid off. I'm not talking about a few dribbles, but puddles. I'm going to return them, they're not worth the mess."
1,Nice Looking. Not Functional,"The pitchers look great, however you cannot pour from them without dribbling your beverage along the side of the pitcher as well. This is regardless of having the lid on or off."
3,Satisfactory,"My lids certainly don't seal. There is a ""spout"" opening in the lid, but no matter which way you turn it, it will still pour or dribble if you tip the pitcher. I expected this from the reviews and ordered anyway, because at least there is some kind of lid. It's not easy to find a good pitcher with a good lid, so I settled. I'm just using it for water at room temp, so at least the lids keep the dust out of my water! The glass is thick, the shape is convenient, the delivery was timely and I'm satisfied with my purchase."
1,Poor design!!,"Unfortunately I did not read the reviews before purchasing. The glass is nice and thick and it keeps my water quite cold, however, I bought this to replace my plastic leaking water pitcher and it didn't fix my problem. These glass pitchers leak when I try to pour water into a glass. I've tried to pour quickly and slowly BUT THEY STILL LEAK. I now have two pitchers which I refuse to use. The handle is also close to the pitcher which makes it difficult to put your entire hand around it to pour. POOR DESIGN OVER ALL"
5,Two more,"I'm ordering two more. I get lots of compliments. Yeah, if you try to pour from them with the lids on it's a joke. They would probably save themselves a lot of headache by just having the lid seal it and not offer the pretense of being able to pour. However, it's never occured to me or anyone else in the family to try to pour with the lids on."
3,Quality is okay!,"The quality of the two pitchers are just okay, the glass or the lids are good in material. The glass is thick enough, the hurdles are reliable.However, there IS an issue with the lids. They do not seal at all, they only covers the pitchers so other things do not fall in.If you want to pour, you will have to REMOVE the lids, and be careful when pouring to minimize the leaking.I have to say the quality is good, but the design is kind of poor. So, use with care!!!"
5,great pitcher,I realy liked these pitchers. They are heavy and I found that the lids fit well and did not allow any sepage when pouring. They are a sort of retro 50's look.
3,OK..,Pros : thick glass & sturdy handle. fits in the fridge door.Cons : the lids don't fit. not so crazy about the lid colors (why not simple white?). it drips & requires constant wiping after use.
3,Good for the money,"These glass jugs are not perfect by any means, but the for the price they are pretty good. They are very solid, but not too heavy. The handle is strong and feels right in my hand. I think the handle is perfect for pouring and well designed. It is true that they are prone to dribbling. You just have to be careful. They could be better designed, but I am still happy with them. It's so hard to find glass anymore that I was just relieved to finally find something to put my tea in that wasn't plastic, and wasn't too expensive. Each jar is one liter, which is a little over four cups. They are each about the size of my Sigg. So they are not very big, but that is good because it allows them to be solid without being heavy.My jugs arrived in perfect condition and well-packaged."
1,you must be lucky if it does not arrive broken,"the packaging is paper thin cardboard & paper thin cardboard seperating the two bottles. I would be amazed the glass can survive any type shipping, MINE DIDN'T. the manufacturer needs to protect their product better if they want to sell it online."
3,Dribbles...a lot,"I ordered these because I love Bormioli Rocco. I have tried and tested their other products from glasses to bowls and never found a thing wrong with them. When I got these, the weight felt good in my hand. We just needed something to store water inside the fridge so I do not mind that they are not airtight. But I was extremely disappointed to find out that when I pour water out from them, they dribble. A LOT. There is a certain way to avoid this if you pour really, really slow or really, really fast. There should be a better way to do this since it is a pitcher, designed to pour out water."
4,Good for the price -- $7 at Ross!,I got my set at Ross for about $7. I have no problems with pouring or loose lids and I like that these 32 oz pitchers are glass and fit well in my fridge. But I did spent some time checking them out in person at Ross so I could get the best fit lid. They've been through my dishwasher just fine many times and I even went back to Ross to get another set.
2,"Dribble, dribble, toil and trouble...","These pitchers look so nice! The lids, however, don't fit snugly at all.But forget about the lids. I bought these pitchers because I was frustrated at the stupid, square milk and orange juice cartons in Brazil, which either shoot the liquid out across the room or drain the liquid down the side of the box. Well, these pitchers are no better. For my first test, I put a medium amount of milk into the pitcher and attempted an optimal pour into my cereal bowl. I eased the pitcher up, and milk dribbled down the side from the spout. This was under perfect pouring conditions. Fail."
2,glass pitchers,The size is fine but the handles are short. The lids are not a tight seal fit so pouring made me nervous. Hand washing was difficult as the top opening is small; getting an adult-sized hand in with a dishcloth was not possible. I gave them away to someone with much smaller hands.
3,Lid does not seal jug,"The glass is nice and the shape is great for fitting into the refrigerator door. However the lid does not seal the jug, so you can't shake your orange juice to mix it up. Also, if you pour your beverage with the lid in place, it causes the liquid to dribble. This means the contents will always need to be stirred, which is a nuisance and you need to remember to remove the nearly useless lid before you pour. My quest for some really useful glass liquid containers for the refrigerator continues!"
2,Broken upon arrival - not packaged well by manufacturer.,"The jugs themselves are not packaged well by the manufacturer. Amazon did everything possible to make sure they did not break (The box was bubble wrapped in two other boxes) however there is no padding in the original box, so there's not much Amazon can do. When I received them, one was broken and one was fine. Instead of returning them, I asked for a replacement in hope that I'll receive another one that is intact so I can have a set. Amazon is paying for the shipping so I'm not losing any money, however, the Bormioli jugs do not seem to be designed to ship.The quality of the jugs are fine; just be prepared for possible breakage."
3,Handle too tight,"We got theBormioli Rocco Gelo Refrigerator Jug 2 Piece Set, One Red Lid and One Green Lid. The handle on one is so close to the body that it is nearly impossible to grip, even for a woman with small hands. Something went wrong in the glass-making process. Very disappointing. We already had an old ""Frigorella"" brand that we love, and thought these would be the same. Would be great except for the manufacturing defect. Too expensive to ship them back, so will probably junk the one with too-tight handle, meaning that we spent nearly $12 for one jug. Otherwise, we like that the pitcher is made of glass and that the compact shape that fits easily in the refrigerator.Bormioli Rocco Gelo Refrigerator Jug 2 Piece Set, One Red Lid and One Green Lid"
2,Well......,"Good sellar, items arrived quickly. The pitchers don't pour well with the lids on, although they were designed to be used in that way. They are the perfect size for a packet of Koolaid or to use to fill my coffeemaker in the mornings. So I'm basicaaly happy. Wish they didn't dribble though."
1,Dangerous! Beware!,"I was filling one of these with 180f hot water and the bottom literally fell off and all of the water spilled on my legs and on the floor.Glass of that thickness should be able to hold liquids around boiling point.I'm disapointed, but happy that my 2 year old didn't get burned by the spilled hot water.Update: i just poured tea out of the one that didn't break and it drips due to a very poor design. Returning this just became an easy decision."
1,do NOT get them - terrible,"I liked the design, glass, and where it's made (Italy). But they are not practical. there is NO WAY that you'd avoid water all over the counter (or floor). I didn't believe it when I read the reviews from others, and had to try it for myself - big mistake!"
2,"Ordered two jars, received so many- into pieces",The pitcher itself is fine- no problem with that. I ordered two pitcher (a pair). When I picked up the box it did not sound right and guess what- one of the pitchers could not stand the fedex and break into pieces. Call this funny- the better packed pitcher suffered the early death. Amazon finally did the class act by refunding me 50% off the price I paid.
2,Lid Leaks,"These glass pitches are heavy duty and very nice....except that the lid leaks when pouring, making a mess. I replaced them with another glass pitcher within about 2 days of using."
3,"Nice Glass, Bad Lids",The glass on these pitchers is really nice but the problem is that you cannot pour liquid with the lids on. It spills all over on both of them so I have to warn everyone to remove the lid. The size is great and they fit well into the side door of the refridgerator but the functionality isn't good since the lids are so bad compared to the glass.
2,"It's true, they make a mess","They're very pretty and the glass feels well-made and very sturdy. However, the poor design makes them dribble down the side every time you pour. Defeats its purpose completely."
1,Could have been a good buy but...,Poorly packed and arrived shattered. The main packaging is fine for a store shelf but frankly I'm surprised anyone gets them in one piece. They might be good but mine were in so many pieces I'd have no way of knowing. It doesn't seem like a fluke so I'm not trying again.
1,Busted when it got,"How sad it proably would have been good but it was in million pieces so because there was no exchange I just got a refund , so I can't really say."
4,Lids do not seal,"Very nice, heavy glass, keeps milk cold, but as stated the lid is cheesy plastic that dribbles, and in addition does not seal the contents in any way. All it does is cover most of the mouth. I had hoped for better."
3,"sturdy, pretty, but dribbles","The glass is heavy and has a nice detailing (examine the photo closely), but the spout dribbles, making it a little messing for tabletop use."
1,Crappy Lids,"As many others have said, the lids fit poorly and the liquid drbbles down the side when you pour. You have to remove the lids before pouring which is a pain when you are holding a baby! Even if you have your glass in one had and pitcher in the other, you have to put the glass down to remove the lid so you won't spill. I did use hot and cold and had no problems."
1,Poor Pour,"Great Concept, but when i pour, the liquid drizzles down the edge of the jug even when held at a 90 degree angle. This isn't a problem if i pour without the lid, but then, what's the point?I use them for water only because otherwise it would make a mess.pros: fine without lid, sturdy thick glasscons: as above"
2,Bormioli Rocco Gelo 2-piece Glass Pitcher Set,"One of the pitchers was delivered in shards of glass. I requested a replacement , but was told a replacement was not possible but could get a refund with requirement that I return the item. I don't think the post office would mail a package of glass shards so I have not seen a refund. Needless to say I would prefer a replacement as I am enjoying the one received intact."
2,Smaller than described,"These pitchers hold closer to 32 oz each, rather than the 41 oz each that is described. Not as big as I had hoped. They seem nice if you want the smaller size, although the lids seem thinner and cheaper than expected, and the lids do not seal.I plan to return these and order the larger size of the same brand (I hope it truly holds the amount it is said to hold!)."
2,These pitchers are worthless,"No matter how carefully and tightly I put the lid on this pitcher; the beverage still leaks out of the lip and on to the counter, flow, guest, what have you. There is some serious engineering problems with these pitchers. The only reason I gave it any stars is because I like the style, that it has a cover and fits into the fridge door."
3,Weight and design,"Although the fit easily in the refrigerator door, the slender design has it's drawbacks. The mouth is too small it get my hand into to wash it. The pour spout is too small to pour very fast and the whole thing is almost too heavy for me to lift by the time it's filled with liquid. Also, there's not enough room between the handle and the side of the pitcher for a comfortable grip. About the only thing going for it is that it's glass, so I don't have to worry about PCBs or anything leaching into my drink except around the lid."
3,Does anyone know if the plastic lids are BPA free?,"Does anyone know if the plastic lids are BPA free? Also, is it really two pitchers or just one? I want to know before I purchase. Thanks."
2,quality,"very poor quality,the jugs had bubbles and chips in the glass,the lids didn't fit all that well either,sorry I bought them"
2,NOT air tight,These pitchers come with cheap plastic lids. The biggest problem is that they let it quite a bit of air so can in no way keep your contents fresh. I'm sending mine back.
2,Pretty but not perfect,"These are sturdy and pretty to look at, but make a mess when pouring. I was looking for a small jug that would hold juices and crystal light and these seemed like they would go the job. However first time I poured from one it made a huge mess on the counter."
5,Perfect Size,"I LOVE glass, yes glass can be heavy but I have no worries about plastic with this product. Perfect size. Pouring cap stays on well when pouring. Great for ice coffee, juice, water,etc."
1,Terrible. Don't waste your money,"These are beautiful glass pitchers -- but the lids are TOTAL garbage.I wish that I hadn't thrown away the box, because I would have packed up the pitchers and returned them immediately.So what's the beef? The lids do not seal, not one bit. I even spread plastic wrap over the mouth then put the lid over the plastic. Okay, that worked, but I shouldn't have to do it.So what's the beef? Liquid does not poor cleanly from the pitcher. Instead the liquid drips all over the place.Amazon, if you would be willing to accept these returned without a box, please let me know. Until then, the pitchers sit unused in a kitchen cabinet.PM"
2,"What could be wrong with a pitcher? Well, they manage to do it.","When you buy a pitcher, you don't expect anything great or bad. It is simple just a pitcher.Well, it is glass, if you fill them up with water/juice and put them into the fridge, you will get cold water/juice, they are a pitcher, right?The problem is with the lid, no matter what I do, I always spill water/juice, the design is terrible and you have to remove the lid before you pour the liquid out.What is the point to have a lid if you cannot use it. I wouldn't buy them again."
3,Glass Pitchers,"Love that these are glass, which is what I was looking for, BUT the caps do not seal enough to be able to shake/mix the contentsthat we want to use them for."
5,Great pitchers,"The size is perfect and the weight of the pitcher is good for people with arthritis. When it first arrived, it came damaged but amazon made things right very quickly. About the lids concern, you just have to take off the lid when you want to pour. I am very happy with it."
1,for decoration only,They look great. The tops are cheap plastic. More liquid dribbles down the side than actually pores. We gave up on them and stuck fake fruit in them.
5,Great!,The CD arrived quickly and it was in wonderful condition. I was very satisfied with the transaction. Everything went very smoothly.
4,The Other Israeli Writing,"This is an important collection of Mizrahi Israeli writers. Jews from Arab lands suffered (and still do suffer) from years of neglect and oppression in Israel. Here, Mizrahi Jews speak in their own voice, often subverting the values of the dominant culture in the process. Some of the writers in this collection have never been translated into English before --- and some, amazingly enough --- have never published their works in Hebrew.Alacalay's collection is an important benchmark in the history of Israel writing. This fine collection will expose the reader to new voices and perspectives within Israeli culture."
2,Keys to the Garden,"I am reading excerpts from this book as required by the instructor of a course I am taking. I am not impressed with any of the readings so far. However, since we will be reading several more selections in the next few months, it is too early to form an opinion about the entire book."
4,Hagerty is back!!,"This is a real loose rock n roll album that seems to be permanently on the verge of colapse, much in the same way as the best trux stuff and reminisant of Alex Chiltons ""like flies on sherbert"".The songs shoot off in freeform directions but always return to good old rock n roll. The best thing Hagerty's done since Accelerator."
4,Standout second solo release from the Hag!,"This is a very good rock and roll album. It's got Neil Hagerty's signature sound collage style of production all over it, but it also has a live, jammy sort of feel to it. Hagerty and his band really get down on a couple of numbers in that snakey guitar boogaloo that characterized so much of Royal Trux's material. On a couple of songs he even sings with a female backing vocalist, in place of jennifer herrema no doubt."
5,unbelievable plug !,"I just had my plugs replaced with these on our 2002 Honda CR-V that we bought new. The CR-V had these from the factory. The plugs had 119,000 miles on them and were in perfect condition. These plugs are well worth the extra money."
5,Just what you need for 110K tune up!,Got these for my 2006 CR-V.Difference in performance was almost instant.There is a reason why Honda OEM Manual recommend these.Happy with the performance so far. Will update if any improvements in the miles/gal.
3,Worked...but,"I received them and they worked in the vehicle, but I was surprised that they did given the condition that I received them. I ordered 4 of them. 2 came in laminated boxes, 1 came in a smashed up unlaminated box and the last came in a plastic baggie. 1 of them had the gap conduit smashed down into the contact. Prying it away to properly gap it was a p.i.t.a. They looked brand new so I am not sure what gives. The order took a long time to ship so maybe they were out of stock and found some in the corner of the floor or something. Anyway they worked, and I breathed a breath of fresh air."
4,NGK 6994,Price for this obsolete plug was good. Delivery was quick! I would recommend this item to other auto repairers looking for an older product.
1,the plugs do not fit Honda accord 2008,returned because the plugs do not fit 2008 Honda accord. Do not know why Amazon website stated the plugs fit. I was charged for shipping.
2,cheap material,Very cheap materialI try to put that sparking plug in my Honda accord 07 ....but during the installation one plug was brake in my car head I just put little pressure and its brake from thread ...don't buy from them
4,Good Russian Grammar Book for beginners,"This Russian grammar book is not the most comprehensive grammar, but it's very good for beginners or anyone who needs a quick reference guide.The book's explanation on aspect in Russian verbs is very clear as well. It explains that the imperfective past is used for processes, whereas the perfective past is used for results. After closer inspection, I realized that these two past tenses are identical to the imperfect and preterit tenses in Spanish. So if you're studying Russian past tenses, you may be able to use the acronyms that I explain in my book on Spanish grammar.Imperfective Past HIDEHabitual Actions (used to + VERB)Incoplete Actions (was/were + ING form)Descriptions in the pastEmotions/Feelings (most of the time)Perfectice Past STARSSudden OcurrenceTime Limit/Complete ActionsAction Disrupts action of Imperfective VerbResult/ReactionSeries of Distinct Events or InstancesBrandon Simpson"
2,Mostly Obsolete Info,"I was sadly disappointed in this book. I was looking for lots of photos of typical home offices from which I could get ideas from. Instead, I got lots of pictures of dated commercial computer and home office furniture from the 1990s that are no longer germaine to the more modern, compact computer equipment and peripherals of the 21st century.The book did briefly discuss office layout at its most basic level, but only in the most generic sense. I think the largest section was on out-of-date office furniture and ergonomic chairs."
1,Very disappointing,"I had hoped for the promised ""hundreds of photos, floor plans, and drawings to inspire..."" but instead got a book with grainy black and white photos of office equipment and individual pieces, with woefully few design layouts or floorplans to consider. If you are looking for an interminable discussion of chairs and lighting, then perhaps you won't be disappointed, but if you are looking for DESIGN, you will be very disappointed."
3,not good for interiors,"I read a review of this product before buy it, about interiors photo using flash; that customer was correct, you`ll see a shadow on the floor(half an orange), this is the shadow of the lens.I think this problem can be solved attaching a flash that come out far from the camera, no matter up or side.My camera is aSony Cybershot DSC-H2 6MP Digital Camera with 12x Optical Image Stabilization Zoom, great camera!In fact this lens is good, you`ll see a wider field but consider other than the built in flash for interiors, when flash is needed of course."
3,Do not buy from ANTOnline,"This lens simply gives a wider angle and most cannot tell much difference... However, If you are to purchase a wide angle lens get this one! As a side note, I would also reccommend to stay away from ANTOnline unless you want to take a risk in buying the product you plan to purchase, regardless of what it may be."
4,Glad to have it,"I bought this accessory lens, and another from another source. The other costs less than half as much, and claimed much wider view - but when I shot my first comparison pix they were close in coverage area. As expected, sharpness isn't outstanding, but when I covered a meeting recently, the best shot I got was a wide angle with this lens. All my comments are early and tentative - but as the subject says I'm glad this is part of my kit."
2,Can't see the difference,"As a convert from film SLR's to a fixed lens digital, I thought the wide angle attachment would be just the thing. I tend to take a lot of room interior and architectural shots with a wide angle lens - a 24mm on a 35mm camera being my favorite.After shooting numerous test shots with and without the wide angle attachment, I seriously can't see much of a difference - especially with a fairly short focusing distance - say 6 - 10 feet.Additionally, screwing the fairly heavy piece of glass onto the sun shade of the camera (the only way it mounts) makes for a very large, unbalanced camera hanging from your neck.If you really need a wide angle, save your money and buy a true interchangeable lens camera."
3,sword officer blue,I got this toy and a knight costume for my 6y son he love's it. It fit's in his hand nicely and it seam's well made. The sword and shield can come off to witch my son just love's.
1,This book seems to have been written for men,Unimaginative and boring. The only other book I've read that was worse or equally as bad was also published by Sapphire.
4,A must have,I have the 6.0 book and its pretty much the same stuff. I bought it so I could figure out the Title Maker better. It is a very helpful book.Easy to find the info I need and I wouldn't think of not having it around. Plus excellent for the price!
5,An audio delight,This audio play features original swing music and a talented cast. The pruduction quality is quite high and the listener really gets a feel of what was life like in the 1940's. It was a pleasure to listen to and I am looking forward to listening to it again. the story is a murder mystery which takes place while a female band tours the west coast. the actors used really brought each character to life and gave that character depth and a unique personality. There are also three original songs performed throughout the play and I have to confess are quite nice and romantic. If you like audiobooks and especially theatre of the mind this is a must to add to your collection.This audiobook contains 4 cassettes and is about six hours long. The packaging also contains large print and braile labeling so this makes a perfect gift for someone who is visually impaired. It is the first time I have seen such thoughtfulness go into a comercially produced audiobook. Highly recommended
4,My AeroPress Loves this.....,Great in the morning for a quick AeroPress coffee or two.....and the same goes for tea at night. I leave mine at 195 and seems to give me the best all-around temp. Convenient and easy to use and Highly recommend!
5,In re: temperature inaccuracy issue,"Given experience with a related unit, and what I know about this manufacturer, the manufacturing environment in which they operate, and the design of this heating/measurement system (and given the context of the other reviews and comments), I am actually proceeding to buy more of these units.I am betting either that the foregoing reviewer was shipped a rare defective unit -- or that the Zojiruchi's engineering standards for temperature measurement and quality control for product performance testing are in greater control than the consumer's, leading them to inaccurate measurements and conclusions. (For more information, see the two extensive ""Comment"" entries appended to the foregoing review.)"
4,"like it, but not very like it.","It is a not bad product, and it has big volume, quiet, and keep water warm for quite long time. However, I do not like the way to fill water, because I have to use a big cup to fill the water; it is not convenient. It has the Energy-Saving Timer Function which is nice, but it only can set from 6-10 hours, and I would like if it also has 2 hours, or 3 to 4 hours setting time."
1,Inner parts of lid near vent disintegrate after 1.5 years,"The water began to have a plastic taste to it after 1.5 years of use. The origin of the smell appears to be the lid. So I disassembled the lid, wanted to see if there was something that got lodged there. To my surprise, the inner structure around the vent crumbled upon touching. And that is where the plastic smell comes from. Basically, the plastic around the vent is melting and in the process releasing chemicals that smell and who knows what else they would do. Because of the way the lid works, vapor condensing on that part of the lid drain back to the main pot, hence the bad taste in the water.Zojirushi's store sells a replacement lid for $22 plus $6 shipping. It is a steep price to pay every 1.5 years. But the most important issue is the potentially toxic chemicals that we have been drinking as the vent slowly melts over time.Definitely a dangerous product."
5,should just work day in and day out,"used something similar at work few years back, where there were about 10 of us using it everyday for 2-3 year before we got something more ""industrial"". my boss took it home and continue to use it for home use.bought it about 3 weeks ago, and it's been very convenient to have hot water ready whenever I want to drink coffee or tea. 3 temperature setting is also good since I don't want piping hot water for my coffee/tea."
5,Great Product,"The water heater is a really great product, large capacity, and keeps water at a boil for continuously for instant access."
5,Zojirushi CV-DSC40E,"This is a superior product. If you have ever lived in Japan, these appliances are a necessary feature in any kitchen/home. This is a larger model and is suitable for large groups or a family. If you do not have large groups (12+) to entertain, I would recommend the smaller models. So far, this unit has been indispensable!"
5,Nice looking hot water dispenser,"I just got it and used it for the first day. It does what it says so far. It is a big item for the kitchen counter, but it looks very beautiful and high class (much better looking than the ones that are a grade below). If you can use up all 4 liters of hot water daily, I'd recommend buying this one, because it is again, a very big item and it stands out."
3,it's broken! what's the warranty?,"Less than a year and this water boiler got steam inside the readout window! It is acting abnormally and afraid to use it.Zojirushi CV-DSC40 VE Hybrid Water Boiler and Warmer, Stainless SteelTrying to reach Amazon to see what the warranty is for a replacement and got this action to write a review. Wish me success in getting a replacement."
1,not as I expected...,"I love this brand.. however, this boiler have some problem even if I did an exchange...On the top of the water tank, there will be some black dots or powder after using it. You can wipe if off some of them, but there will be some left at the bottom of the tank too.So...I try to load the water under the full water line, the black fonts printing on it.It is much better, you will not see those black powder. But it is not normal at all..."
3,Perfect for two years,Zojirushi was a really perfect addition to my kitchen and we used it every day. After two years the pump just stopped working.It made a strong noise and that is it. I need a new one.
4,Excellent except for one flaw,"I have two other Zojirushi boilers and this is the most quiet in terms of its boiling and dispensing. Probably the characteristic I don't like most is that the curved indentation is not deep enough (or the nose is not long enough, depending on how you look at it). This means that filling a tetsubin teapot (Japanese style teapot that looks like a flying saucer) is impossible because the tetsubin has very wide sides and its opening is in the middle. Would it ""kill"" Zojirushi to deepen the indentation or more simply extend the nose further? I not too crazy about the stainless steel look and prefer the older styles but this I can live with."
3,Leak Electricity,"This water boiler leaks electricity from its stainless body! If I touch the body with my fingers, I always feel a little of numbness. After I pulled out the power cord, the numbness went away. I repeated a few times, and they were always the same."
1,Non-stick Interior--Not Stainless,"Beware, I just received this unit and was trying it out when I realized it was not stainless steel inside. It has a non-stick coating. I am sending it back tomorrow."
2,Rust in one week.,"I thought I'd hit the jackpot with this model. Good size, looks nice and has some nice features. However it developed a rust area in the bottom of the cylinder at the bead within one week of use. That doesn't say much for quality control. As its been used I can't return it to Amazon now so we'll see how it goes with the manufacturer. Should it be replaced without issue I'll probably rate the item a four."
5,Exactly what I expected!,Our family drinks a lot of tea and my daughter drinks hot chocolate and this product is perfect! We love it!
4,Great product but not sure it is worth the price.,"Water Boiler works great, love it. But not sure it is worth 2x the price of the Wal-Mart one?"
3,Hybrid Water Boiler and Warmer,"Zojirushi CV-DSC40 VE Hybrid Water Boiler and Warmer, Stainless SteelDue to its vacuum insulation, it certainly saves a bit of power when compared with just an electric kettle and maybe some time. I am not sure it is worth the extra $100 over and above the price of a top-of-the-line stainless kettle though. Probably most appropriate for a large family of tea drinkers. Lots of bells and whistles that may - or may not - be worth it.I am hoping that it will pay off in the usual Japanese reliability and long life."
2,consider other options,"I just received this water boiler and hate to have to say it is going back tomorrow. The looks of it are nice. Its ability to function is another story. I poored the water in (which did not take as long as stated to boil) and the readout said 212 degree (I set it for 208). I poured a cup into a thermos type cup with a lid and checked the temp with the thermometer I use for my tea. It was 10 degrees off. So I dialed it down to 195. I checked the temp for this and it was off by 10 again. Finally I checked it at 175 and it was off by 12 degrees. So if you like teas that can boil at 198 max temp, this may be the pot for you. As for me, I guess I am back to boiling and using a thermo carafe."
5,The Zojirushi DSC40 is a great product!,"I've been using the Zojirushi DSC40 for almost 3 weeks now. The quality and build of this water broiler/warmer is superb. So easy to use and yet very high tech! My wife loves it. My mom now wants one for her place.The vacuum temperature (no electricity) option works great! It will keep the water termperature at 150 degree for eight hours. If you want it hotter, just press the ""REBOIL"" button and you will have 212 degree hot water in approximately 7 minutes. Oh and when it does boil water, it's design to emit steam slowly or as less as possible so as to avoid having too much water build up on your cabinet above the unit.Although the 4 liter capacity is a bit small for our family use, it's really no hassle at all to add more water when it's low. Come to think of it, the 4 liter is perfect because it's not too heavy to move it back and forth from the sink to the outlet when it's full of water.This unit is definitely worth the high price. You won't regret it."
5,Absolutely wonderful...,"This Zojirushi replaced an under-sink Insinkerator instant hot water heater (which seemed to fail every 18m). Bought this unit and love it -- fill it up in the morning, can draw a full 1.5l coffee pot (french press) much hotter than insinkerator. Then we set to energy-saver mode (no electricity, just insulated keep-warm mode). If I want a cup of tea in the afternoon and the water has cooled off too much, I hit reboil and in a short time (typically minutes), I can make tea...Saves energy, ready quickly enough for my needs to not have to keep it on any of the 3 keep-warm-at temperature settings. Quiet, nice design... Plan to get one for my Mother-in-law for Christmas. Highly recommended..."
3,Basic Alternature Stuff,"Smart Brown Handbag sound surprisingly like a 90's version of The Psychedelic Furs. Deadpan vocals, mildly alternative sounds and predictably maudlin lyrics add up to a not wholly unpleasant experience. There is nothing groundbreaking here, just the expected angst and unthreatening music. Proof that obscurity is no guarantee of greatness. ""Cleo In Her Sputnik"" is the standout"
2,hokey pokey rock,"Purchased this CD because back in the day my dad was in a band called ""The Continentals"" and cut a record. My brothers and I never got to hear it. Heard that this CD had the two songs & made the purchase. The recording is pretty bad. The songs are ""Continental Bop"" and ""Cool Walk"". Despite bad recording, enjoyed hearing the songs."
1,Predictably biased,"Normally I would have believed Phillips. But after watching Meet The Press and hearing the truth from Pres. Bush, I now realize that this book is just another example of dirty politics.You can skip this unless you enjoy reading fiction."
1,Yeah! What did happened to the reviews?,"If this isn't a perfect example of manipulating a book, then I don't know what is. Phillips like Howard Dean, comes out of the gate fast and then fizzles out fast.And look at all of the ""unhlepful votes"" on the under 1 star reviews. Something smells here?hmmmmmm?"
2,Innuendo After Innuendo,"For whatever personal reasons, Phillips has savaged the Bushes - both GHWB and GWB, as well as their forebears and offspring - by building upon innuendo after innuendo, and weaving them into a largely unsubstantiated web of intrigue and deceit. It is as though playing cards were tilted on their ends, resting one against the next, and precariously poised so that a slight breeze might blow the whole lot down.To trash the Bushes page after page, Phillips has used the wily techniques of a skillful writer, apparently unaccustomed to any critics suggesting that the ""[Emperor] hasn't got anything on."" If the innuendoes and the qualifications and hedging are removed, Phillips' theses fall like a house of cards. Clearly, vendetta or payback was afoot as he crafted each page of this tome."
4,Surprise!,"I was a little disappointed after reading the title that it wasn't easy potshots at the world's most worthy target, but rather a fact-based, rather dry account of the last century's rise of dynasty, military-industrial complex, and of course 4 generations of Bushes' feeding frenzy on said trends. But call me lazy."
1,Hardly Believable,"Sorry, but I don't believe Kevin Phillips. He was as we all know a close friend of President Richard M. Nixon and even wrote a book called ""The Emerging Republican Majority."" Now he wants us to believe that he is anti republican and attacks the Bush's?Sorry, I'm not buying it. This is all about writing and selling books and nothing about integrity or facts.By the way, check the standing on Phillips other books like ""Profits and Politics"", ""The Cousins Wars"" and other junk that he has written to see how well they did and are doing.They all seem to come flying out of the gate and then drop off quickly (once word of mouth spreads and people actually read this garbage)Save your money and buy a better book. This guy has no real credibility. Remember, this guy helped get Nixon elected. Does that tell you something? I mean, someone who supported Nixon, possibly the only President that was worse than Clinton and he expects us to believe him? Pass on this one."
4,...,"This is a good book. For those of us who are informed, however, the book provides little new information. The source of the information being from such a high-level, former republican does raise an eyebrow. It is refreshing to see some republicans can change their minds so radically and come out for the truth. Especially interesting are some of the new details about the October Surprise engeneered by the Reagan / Bush / Iranian Hostage takers. [...]"
4,A country divided!,"Phillips offers a vast amount of information on the Bush family. Unfortunately it is sometimes shrouded in nearly impenetrable language, or overshadowed by his obvious dislike of the Bush's, sometimes degenerating into name calling. He also introduces some fairly wild conspiracy theories that detract from his work reading like a scholarly historical account. The bottom line, as is clear if you read some of the other reviews, is that if you are a diehard Bush loyalist, you will probably hate this book, and your time would be better spent watching Fox News. If you believe Bush to be the worst thing that has ever happened to America, this book is a must read. I like the book because of the controversy surrounding it, but I think it is a rather sad commentary on how divided our country has become."
5,if you read the book you will find . . .,"that Phillips does indeed discuss the Kennedys and points out that while the Clintons are not currently a dynasty, if Hillary were to run and win in 2008, they also would constitute a dynasty. He also deplores appointments to major positions of the children of Colin Powell, Justice Scalia, and Strom Thurmond, a tendency that he correctly points out that the Founders would have deplored.Phillips point in the book is that dynasties are dangerous to America, and the focus is on the Bush family simply because a Bush--and not a Kennedy or a Clinton--is in the White House at the moment. [...]"
4,Eye-opener for a Republican,As a longtime Republican I was sure I would despise the book and the way it is written is definitely too one-sided. Yet one cannot deny the numerous facts it reveals and I will definitely vote against the Bush administration in 2004. They are not leading this country in the right direction.
1,"Bad, bad book","I am a liberal Democrat, so I was predisposed to like this book. It is the worst book I have read in ages. Phillips excels at innuendo. He does no original, scholarly research and quotes other books as his sources without wearing out any shoe leather . The structure of the book is horrible. He hops around wildly and uses filler shamelessly. Shame on the publisher."
1,American Dynasty - Writer's Tragedy,"To see Kevin Phillips resorting to using Vanity Fair as a primary source was just plain laughable. While the author looks for hidden conspiracies and plots against western civilization he loses the reader by not including any factual information (by his own admission in endless interrupting citations - his comments are speculative at best) or relevant source material. Sadly it would seem that Mr. Phillips is just another man with an axe to grind.While there are some interesting questions raised in the book - the arguments just don't add up and the endless polemics of Kevin Phillips are maddening. Save your time and your money - there's nothing here but empty accusations and hysteric declarations of a right wing conspriacy. For all the 'information' that's in this collection of words, you'd be better off listening to NPR or CNN on a regular basis."
1,"Another cog in the ""Hate Bush"" wheel.",I can not believe that I actually wasted my money on this dribble. I thought it was going to be a factual commentary on the Bush family. I couldn't finish it because of the author's poor writing This seems to have been written with an agenda in mind. It's just another cog in the wheelof people who hate George Bush. I truly have a hard time believing it's a best seller.
1,Buy two----makes great bookends!,"One thing that I can say about Kevein Phillips books is that they are thick and very useful. I would buy two copies, they make great bookends. Or can be used as a doorstop. Or can be used to swat maggots or cockroaches. Very versatile book indeed.As far as the content inside----as some other reviewers have indicated, if you enjoy reading tabloids and other trash, then you will enjoy this book. If you want facts or reality, then you will find more reality watching Pro Wrestling than by reading this trash by Phillips. Actually, I think that Pro Wrestling is more realistic than the idioms perpetrated by Phillips in this book....and more entertaining too!It's your money. Your choice. I'd spend it elsewhere. Anywhere but on this trash. Total waste of money."
4,Party Favors ...,"Warning I: If you're a Democrat, by the time you finish this book, your neck, like mine, will be sore from nodding in the affirmative following each woeful divulgence after woeful disclosure after woeful-realization. Oh, and the hair on your knuckles will look disheveled and your hands' backs will be raw from wind burn. Why? From continually punching your fists skyward as you whisper-squeal, ""Yes! Yes!""Warning II: If you're presently a Republican, you'll be a Democrat after having finished this book. Congratulations.Let's all contribute to Kerry's campaign to buy up all copies of ""American Dynasty"" so they can be placed in every hotel and motel bedside table drawer; you know, right next to the Kleenex.;-)"
1,Some poor tree got cut down for this?,"I have read some outrageous trash about the Bush family, but other than those cheap tabloids on sale in supermarkets, never have I read so much garbage as this. Save your money on this biased nonsense and buy a cheap tablid instead, that is if you like to read this sort of junk. So save your money on this and buy The Star or National Inquirer if you like this sort of thing.Looking at the 5 stars tells me just what a sorry state this country is in. No doubt these are the same people that think that Michael Jackson and O.J. Simpson are innocent too. Give me a break."
1,Full of trash,I read about 120 pages of it and I had to stop. Not one shred of evidence for the accusations that is written. If you like Al Franken's book then you may like this on too. go ahead waste your time and money reading these kind of trash
1,Like a candy bar for the brain!,"Just a ""feel good"" book for poor people who want to believe that the Rich are Getting Richer at their expence. Like candy for the brain, harmful to your mental health!"
1,Part of a liberal fantasy,"I read a lot of accusations, but no proof. The book will probably sell a lot since liberals now more than ever need a hug, and this is the book to do it. I found my copy on the ""fantasy"" shelf."
1,I just couldn't find anything useful in this book,"[...] I just came back from [book store] (they had 1 copy) and I spent an hour reading and re-reading this book while enjoying a coffee.There is absolutely nothing in-between the covers but dead air and empty space. This book is a loser and a snoozer. If it wasn't for the coffee, I would have fallen asleep...yaaaawwwwnnnnn. What a boring and stupid book."
1,A Waste of Perfectly Good Paper and Ink,"While Phillips is admittedly a reasonably good story-teller, the book is nothing but an unfortunate re-hash of old diatribes, biases and liberal conspiracy theories. The lack of primary sources and his continuous use of secondary sources with long-standing political axes to grind is unnerving and annoying. Whatever credibility the book may have had is destroyed by the lack of objective, original research or documentation. I'm both proud of having finished it - perseverance has not been one of my strong points - and a bit embarrassed to have wasted so much time. The book is neither informative nor charming. If you don't like President Bush, there are better, more effective attacks, and if you do like the President, this hash of old invective will merely raise your blood pressure."
3,"Interesting, but really disorganized","It appears that Phillips couldn't really decide if he wanted to write about history or politics. For this reason his story jumps around across the decades and between subject matter, attacking four generation of books for a wide variety of reasons.I bought the book because I am not a fan of either President Bush and there is plenty of red meat here for people like me, particularly in the chapter on the rise of the religious right. However, Phillips is just trying to do too much to be completely coherent. He offers side arguments off the top of his head without fully developing them and he really should have a lot more footnotes for what he covers.If you're looking for more reasons to hate the President, there are better researched and more satisfying titles out there right now."
5,"Exposes ... in-your-face, hate-inspired, corruption.","This book is an excellent compendium of all that is wrong with the Unelected Appointee who currently resides in the White House, aka, the pResident.It gives the reader all required information for completing the declaration: Given any current issue in the political scene, here are the facts of how this pResident is actively opposing the interests of 95% of the Amerian people.Great expose' of a monstrous family and destructive regime!"
4,American Dynasty,"American Dynasty: Aristocracy, Fortune, and the Politics of Deceit in the House of Bush by Kevin Phillips cleverly presents us with historical facts and memorable events. The book is very good and I enjoyed it very much. See it because it really makes an amazing viewing experience. I couldn't believe my eyes. From history, speeches to insanity and the mad world of politics. Happy reading and viewing!!"
4,An Important Read,"It's been said the world changed on September 11, 2001. But once you read Kevin Phillips's book, you may think otherwise. Why? Because Phillips offers an historical context for the Bush administration that few others offer. While the author's analysis of the Bush family's connections with big oil, big business, the religious right and secrecy seems thin in places, it's still required reading by any person who doesn't quite understand why the Bush Administration acts the way it does. By reading Bush Dynasty, I have a much better sense of contemporary history and the Bush family's place in it. It's a well researched, well presented and implicit indictment of the Neo-Con's dangerous agenda."
4,Good Information Not Well Written,"Phillips failed to keep me fully interested. I did enjoy the historical perspective that he takes with the family, but the lanugage is not 'smooth'. But since this is the only book that I have read about the history of the family I cannot fully judge the context in which it is written, I have read the House of Bush House of Saud, and find the 'flow' much better, but there is not history to that book. Worth the money though if one can labor through some of the 'down' parts."
4,Very Pleased,"This was an in-depth review of the rise of the Bush family in American politics and business, from a conservative writer no less. I was impressed by the amount of research and will certainly read my books written by this author."
3,Conspiracy Theory Writing Run Amuck,"Kudos to Kevin Phillips for writing such entertaining and imaginative conspiracy-theory prose. He highlights and expands on all the same nutty Bush-bashing rubbish spewed by the Left since before Election 2000. Using all the loaded buzzwords that stir anger in the hearts of passionate liberals: ""Halliburton,"" ""Iraqgate,"" and ""BCCI,"" Phillips makes sweeping assumptions, and draws cynical myopic conclusions in a profoundly ""Buchanan"" way. After reading his work, one feels Phillips left out critical information in building his case against the Bush clan. What about the secret phone line between the White House and the Trilateral Commission? What about the Rockefellers' control over Bush's appointments? What about the clandestine cabal of New York bankers that really runs things? Perhaps Phillips should consult televangelist Pat Robertson before sitting down to write again. Or maybe Phillips is just part of a conspiracy, too."
1,Is that all there is?,"I guess I expected something earth shattering given the sub-title of the book, but if this is ""intellectual and political dynamite,"" well, here's another example of journalistic hype.After reading this book, I voter for Bush."
1,Writer's Deceit,"Beyond the blatant anti-Bush fanaticism, this book represents a true collection of pseudo-intellectual babble that is a sure cure for the worst case of insomnia.Fact is difficult to identify amid the litany of references to other author's opinions, rather than hard sources.All one can hope for is more than $1 at the used bookstore."
1,Bias plus author fees plus freedom of speech = garbage,"Anyone who is politically aware knows the Kevin Phillips and Adrianna Huffington story. This book is garbage and does little to advance the understanding of an era where American leadership can do so much to set the tone for a more secure and free world. Kevin Phillips needs to listed under the Amazon section of ""Comic Books""."
2,Speaking High Frequency German,"For the money I spent, I felt this set of tapes was not worth it. The product description advertises 6 hours of tape, however, each of the six tapes played for less than one hour. In addition, the tapes are repeated - For example, side 1 on tape 1 plays again as a side on tape 3 or 4. Why? If I didn't get it the first time around, why wouldn't I just go back and listen to tape 1 again? In all, there might actually be 3 hours of lessons. Also, the lessons cover only an extreme minimum of vocabulary and key phrases. This product was definately not worth it."
1,Be careful,"this string winder is good and served its purpose. But be careful when using on expensive vintage, or clearcoated guitars, because it is not rubber, or a soft material if you spin it too aggressively and fast, and it runs into your headstock, it could chip or leave a mark on your clearcoat,if they rubber coated the arm part, that would be the best.mostly my fault tho, so go ahead and buy it if your'e thinking while reading this, 'this guy is an idiot'"
5,Fast and works well,Made changing the strings on my strato-clone extremely easy and fast. The cutting blade is simple to use and cuts through my .008 gauge strings without hesitation. The winding head fitted my strat fine. Would highly recommend this product to any budding guitarists.
2,"Cutter Ok, Pin Puller Weak","Overall it's a pretty good tool, but the pin puller built into the handle will only survive one or two re-stringings with tough to pull pins. The plastic handle does not hold up. The winder is ok, and the cutter has been great.I wish I could find a stronger longer lasting bridge pin puller. I guess needle nose pliers are probably the tool of choice."
5,Great for What it Does,Works well for what it does cuts winds and pulls pegs. ALWAYS let the tension off before pulling a peg lol. I forget that sometimes even though i should know lol.
5,Works fine,"It is a string winder, what more can I say. It works as it should and saves time. Very useful when restringing a guitar."
5,Nice,"Very convenient. Allows me to clip the end of the string very close to the tuning machine, as well as wind the strings very fast."
5,"Does what it says, great price","This item does exactally what it says. The string cutter works wonderfully. No problems at all, cut through the strings on my guitar with ease. The peg puller works better then the generic tool i used to use, again no problems with it, does what is says. The string winder also works very well, again better then the generic tool i used to use. This tool does exactally what it says and if you play guitar AT ALL or anything related you would have to be nuts not to buy this. The price is also very cheap, espicially because it isnt some cheap plastic piece of junk. If you play guitar and are afraid to buy this then get a new hobbie."
3,Not so great!,It doesnt look like it will hold itself together all that well. Plus I was having hard time getting the pegs out. In fact I had to use pliers for one of them. This tool is not all that useful.
4,Not sure about it yet - user lost it in her room?,"Well it may be a great device for restringing guitars, but the user lost it in her room some where. She just restrung her electric guitar, when I asked if she used the winder I purchased - ""I don't know where it is..."" Typical teen room - you can't see the floor most of the time."
1,crappy!,Mine broke after a few months! 13 dollars down the drain! Why not have a cutter that not only works but allows you to cut other things? An american made wire cutter and a string winder are more ideal- this thing is crap!
1,Don't bother buying this.,This guitar string winder/cutter is too big. Takes up too much room to fit in my guitar case. The end is so big it hits the next tuning peg when I turn it. Doesn't even have a way to pry bridge pins out of the bridge like the cheaper string winders have. Useless piece of junk but will cost too much to send it back. Will end up as a Gag gift.
3,Just So-so,"Truth is, I haven't needed to use it yet. But I'm not very impressed with the quality. The cutter doesn't look very substantial, though it looks like the winder part should work OK."
4,great product,Before I bought this I had to wind my strings by hand and cut my strings with a wire cutter. This is a very easy product to use and works great. It also has a good sized handle and is easy to hold.
5,Does its Job,"This versatile tool does what it says it does. Pretty good quality. But, after purchasing, I realized that a tool like this isn't too necessary. Some scissors and a little bit of elbow grease would accomplish the same tasks. But, it does make it a little easier and slightly more efficient."
5,Great product.,What more can I say? This is a great product for the money. It does exactly what it is supposed to do and does it well. I would buy another one if the need ever arises.
4,"Different than the image shown, but still does everything advertised","I was initially disappointed with this product because it did not appear to have the bridge pin puller that is shown in the image above. As it turns out, the pin puller is integrated with the tuning peg winder. An open notch allows you to pull the pin from the winder. A much better and safer option than pliers!Overall a great product, does what it says it does and is sturdy."
5,Super handy tool,This tool is perfect to have in hand when putting new strings on acoustics and electric guitars. The bridge pin removal tool helps you remove the pins without damaging the guitar.
2,Good winder...lame cutter.,The winder works great but the cutter is a little lame because it doesnt have a spring mechanism. You have to pull it apart to cut again. Not a huge deal but it adds a couple seconds to yoir string changing time.
2,NOTHING SPECIAL,ITS JUST AS QUICK PUTTING STRINGS ON WITHOUT THIS THING THE ORIGINAL WAY. THESE THINGS DONT SAVE ANY TIME AT ALL. I HAD TO GET ONE. TRIED IT ONCE AND PUT IT ASIDE. WILL PROBABLY JUST GIVE IT AWAY. waste of money
3,"Haven't used, bought as a gift, appears cheap",I haven't used this product as I have bought it for Christmas presents. Upon initial inspection it appears to be cheaply made. Pictures of the product make it look like more of a tool than it is. I wouldn't expect it to be a one-time buy item. I would say that you will be needing a replacement.
2,pin puller,I'm confused...where on this thing is a pin puller!? I just received this and have no way to get the pins out!
4,If only less bulky would be 5 star,"A bit heavy and large, but still very useful and comfortable compared to cheaper options. I'd buy it again if I didn't have one."
3,You get what you pay for.,"The product gives you what it advertises. Barely. Cumbersome winder, usless peg puller. However I like the cutters, E to E, no problem. Lightweight and worth keeping in your gig bag as a backup. Cheap in price and cheap in construction. Pretty much sums it up."
4,Pro String Winder and Cutter,"I have used this product. It works very well, and is small enough to fit easily in my guitar case.Winding is a snap and the cutting feature is nice"
5,Planet waves pro winder string winder and cutter,"This product is simple and functions as advertised. I am able to remove old strings, wind-up new strings, cut off extra strings all in a snap, and without having to have extra tools. Definitely recommend."
4,Strings ARE attached!,"This ""winder"" makes it a breeze to change guitar strings. The strings attach nice and firmly and it is so much easier than doing it manually."
5,Performs as advertised,I have been struggling to cut my guitar strings with a worn out wire cutter for far to long. Most guirarists have a string winder already. Adding the cutting tool was a great idea. The Planet Waves tool cuts through acoustic guitar strings like a new nail cutter cuts through a soft fingernail. I am very happy with this product.
5,Sames time and wrist,Honestly I didn't have high hopes for this product but bought it with the thought that I'd return it if it didn't work. I kept it. It really makes a difference; very convenient having one tool with everything. The pin-puller takes a little getting used to-- you have to use a little force to get it snapped on to the pin correctly. Good value.
4,great,great product for guitarist. can't beat the price for what it does. if you have a guitar this should be in your bag
3,does what it says (almost),"Well, you can pretty much still use a pair of needle-nose pliers to cut strings and pull the pins on the bridge, but I was hoping for a good string-winder that had all of those. It does what it says, but weirdly enough, the string-winder barrel isn't quite deep enough to go over my standard acoustic headstock keys, so it wobbles.Not bad, but certainly not perfect"
5,Cool!,It's so much easy to deal with your guitar using this string winder and cutter! A w e s o m e!
1,Junk,The metal will scratch your instrument if try to remove pins . And when winding it basically fell apart in my hands. I tries putting it back to get her thought it was a fluke but no chance.... Stick to the cheap plastics.
1,Broke in a Month,Worked okay - nothing special - for about 30 days. Then the cutter end broke in half leaving a sharp edge and an unusable tool. I would second the view already posted here: get a cheaper one and buy a pair of wire cutters. Both will last much longer and work just as well or better.
5,great product for the price,"This machine is perfect for learning songs, solos, or transposing. The loop feature is very handy and hands free. I haven't tried the new model but can't imagine any more it could offer. It is very simple to use logical in layout."
4,Works well,"I purchased this for it's effect on internal bleeding and on loose stool that comes with my Crohn's Disease.It has worked well for both. Although, hasn't cured anything. It has relieved those issues for the most part.The taste isn't the best but it hasn't made me gag so I can tolerate it.I am quite thankful I have found this product!"
3,Could not notice any real changes,"Product as described, but I could not notice any difference or improvements. That said, I was not sick or anything just wanted to try it and see if it changes anything. Did not cause any stomach upset either. Taste is ok in water."
2,unfortunately my experience was bad,"I bought this with high expectation, coz it's a genuine Kodak product. This diminished quickly while I was opening up the package. They made a simple charger a bit too complicated. The universal adapters is a good idea, but non of them snapped onto the charger base, I suppose this is an isolated case , unlucky for me, but then when I closely observed the snapping mechanism on the pieces, they are really awkward, and easy to break. I really would like to hear from ppl who actually was able to use this for more than a year. What's more is on the charger base, the metal piece were so difficult to be flipped out of the socket, I had to use a screw driver to do the job. Overall, good ideas, terrible design flaw. Hope you have better luck, coz in my opinion, buying this would be a gamble."
4,BEWARE labeling on Kodak packaging,I ordered a Kodak K7500-C battery charger kit -- and what I received had K7500-C on the bottom of the Kodak box. What was inside was the K7500 (NOT the -C as specified). The K7500 can NOT hold the Kodak KLIC-8000 Li-Ion battery. Amazon was very helpful and exchanged the mis-labeled and mis-sold unit and replaced it with the correct one. Shame on Kodak!
1,Horrible =(,"They sent me the wrong item, apparently in the correct packaging, and I was told I couldn't return it, so I was ripped off."
1,WORST Strap Ever,I purchased the strap for my husbands Polar Watch as his other one broke. This wrist strap didn't even last him a couple weeks before everything started fraying and then within a couple more weeks after that it broke as well. I am really disappointed as I can't seem to find another band for a $450.00 watch. Polar needs to do something about this thing. CRAP
2,Overpriced,"I'm pretty dissapointed. THis book was quite expensive. The cover of the ""book"" did not match the cover of the book in the picture above. The book I got is more of a glorified pamphlet. Yes, the information in it is helpful, but $10-$12 is a more reasonable price."
2,I should have read others' comments. Very pricey and poor quality.,"I was expecting a book, not a office boy copy. I am very disappointed with the quality. That is what I get for not reading reviews before I order. Then I order a book called releveling your manufactured home by the same guy, and it's the copied portion of the above listed book. I was stupid not once but twice. BUT WAIT...THERE'S MORE. In a very Billy Mays type move, he did provide 2 clear plastic hoses that came with their own hose connectors... And.. there's even more... They each have their very own corks. Sorry amazon, but this one was a loooooooser. I am usually very easy to please, but this one was one major let down."
2,Overpriced,"There is some good information in this thin book and I believe the author is knowledgeable on the subject but it is overpriced. Disappointing, wish I saved the $34.95."
1,manual for manufactured/mobile home repair and upgrade,This book is basically [not a wise choice]. Not many details or drawings. Just a few ideas. Value of about [zero].
2,Mobile Home repair,"This book was very general and lacked diagrams and specific instructions. I would recommend another book called Foremost Mobile Home Fix It Guide: Your Manufactured Home Repair Book. Amazon offers a deal on both books, but if you get the foremost book you really don't need the other."
3,Not for the Less-than-knowledgeable,"It is a decent book with much information, but it is not as detailed as I was expecting. The author does not explain many of the repairs or the ""how-to's"" but just assumes that you know how to do them. For example, to replace a toilet cut out the flange and put a new one in. But how? He doesn't explain. So, it can be a useful book if you already have a decent working knowledge of home maintenance and use of tools."
2,Good info but ....,"We found the information very useful, however, very disappointed in the ""manuscript"" construction(I wouldn't call it a book) considering the extremely high price. Don't expect this to hold up for any lenghth of time to use as a reference manual due to poor quality (such good information deserves better). No publisher, no ISBN, pricey"
5,OMG!!!!!!,"This fella is SOOOOOOOO big and SOOOOOOO realistic that my husband didn't want it sitting on our coffee table cuz it freaked him out :o) I do admit she is VERY realistic-looking!! The babies on her back look totally real, too. I'm giving it to my grandson who will LOVE it. Schleich does it again!"
1,Grandson will love it,Liked the feel of the plastic. Seemed heavy duty. But no babies came with it in the package. Still plan to give it to him.
3,Trestle Bridge,The Bridges directions were not easy to follow. Some types of toy trains will not clear the top of the bridge. The plastic stands don't work well.
1,disappointing,I purchased this book with the intention of adding to my library of art techniques used with the elderly in long term care. This book was a true disappointment. The techniques offered are simplistic beyond belief and completely underestimate the abilities of those living in long term care. If I offered these suggestions to the residents I work with they would be offended. Although the techniques I use are simple in structure and design they are not child-like as are those presented in this book.
3,Excellent value for average player,"I have used these clubs for numerous visits to the driving range and many games on local courses. I have had no problems whatever and am very happy with them; they are a pleasure to use. They may not be good enough for top players; I am certainly not one, but I believe they are outstanding value for money for the beginner and intermediate player. I find it hard to believe the guy who says his driver head broke after ten shots - he is so vitriolic I wonder if he works for a rival company."
4,Good Value Clubs,"Hey, I wasn't looking for anything special but I'm tired of playing with seriously old clubs. These aren't spectacular but I've played with them a few rounds and they play fine. I'm sure if you're a low handicap you'd find fault, but for an average player they are fine and you can't beat the value. I say get these and have some money left over for balls, globes, shoes, greens fees... and so forth."
3,"HiPPO X-P2 Complete Golf Kit (Men's, Right-Handed, All Graphite Shafts, Standard Flex)","I am a beginning golfer so I can't tell if my shots are bad because of me or the club. Overall these clubs performed rather well. The fairway woods were good and i had no problem with them. The driver isn't great, doesn't have a good feel to it, but it may be that I am not a good driver player. The irons were the best part of this se until about 3 months in when I bent two of the club faces. They actually caved in from hitting it too high off the tee. However Hippo says they will replace the defective clubs if i send them in. THe putter is alright a decent one and the bag has been flawless. Overall I'm happy with my purchase, you can't beat a golf set for 120 bucks even if I may need to send in a few irons or replace them."
1,driver head cracked wide open after hitting about 10 balls,"This club set is by far the worst I ever used. I bought it last December. Last weekend I took it out for the first time in a driving range. After hitting about 10 drivers, the head just cracked wide open. I didn't hit the ground or anything like that, the head didn't broke off, just literally cracked wide open. This is horrible!! No driver should crack after only 10 hits.Don't ever buy this brand. I would give it a 0 if there were such rating"
2,Deficient,"This is an interesting economic study, but is deficient in one major respect. The book assumes that separatism was entirely economic, rather than religious and political, and mistakenly supposes that the British actually supported Zionism, when quite the opposite is true.Beginning in 1929, for example, the British enforced Islamic law concerning Jewish prayer at the Western Wall in Jerusalem, thereby prohibiting Jewish worshipers from approaching the sacred wall within 10 feet, and from sitting there. Furthermore, the British actually instigated Arab riots against Jews, and prohibited Jewish communities from defending themselves.Furthermore, while the book rightly acknowledges Arab attacks on Jewish communities in 1929, it fails to note that such attacks actually began more than 20 years earlier, and therefore preceded by a substantial margin any ""economic"" development cited herein.--Alyssa A. Lappen"
5,great doc about the mob,"I feel I was let in on a secret I didn't want to know about. Compelling, disturbing, and ultimately sad to see the reality behind these damaged people. But, still peppered with a few humurous dashes like the ""Rat a Tat Tat"" cutaway. For a doc pretty stylish in both the camera work and editing. The cinematography was very well presented. Fast scene changes evoked the warning of watch your back. Unexpected movements in the film highlighted the dangerous and violent theme of mobster life. Fitting the topic, the film was also a little dark. Shifts from color to black and white were dramatic and well placed. The Real Casino was an interesting and entertaining look at how real mobsters rationalize their environment and justify their lives. A must for anyone into mob lore. Check out both the deleted scenes and the making of..."
1,Horrible,This movie is not at all what I expected. I would not recommend it to anyone. I was at best Completely Pointless. I am very dissatisfied to say the least.
5,An Instant Favorite!,"Any child who enjoys playing the familiar rhyming game of ""This Little Piggy..."" will truly love this fun holiday adaptation. The book has clear illustrations and sturdy interactive flaps My daughter asks t read it again and again. She loves to make the reindeer pop up and can even read the story to me. You won't be disappointed."
4,Practical - easy to handle and fits the purpose,"Good fit and the bottom layer prevents books from slidingIt would have been better to make sure the page turning process was easier, though"
2,Reads like a diary,"In this tome, Modesitt demonstrates a real talent for putting words down on the page without advancing the plot one whit. The story's OK, when it's moving, but in the meantime we get so much detail about the protagonist's workday at his consulting practice that we could easily write his invoices for him. Do we really need to know about every single time the character gets up to make a pot of tea, or what he had for lunch and what he thought about the quality of the food?If Modesitt had cut out half the pages, this book would've been a solid 80's-style cyberpunk yarn. As it stands, perhaps he should've gone for stylistic novelty by presenting the novel as a LiveJournal circa 2100, since that's what the content basically amounts to."
2,Tedious Dullness,"Borrring.It almost got good a couple of times, but that quickly passed as we got back to the mundane life of answering the phone and writing a report."
4,Sweet Cyberpunk,"Long periods of what can only be described as real life, punctuated by moments of violence that are, to most of us, unreal, made this book for me.What I thought was a bit stilted and slow at first rapidly developed into a storyline that I could not put down. From increased media intrusion, to far more user-friendly computers, to AIs with attitude, this book covered the ""is the future better or worse"" spectrum. Along the way there are some ideas about the nature of sentience and tech that are echos of William Gibson's work. Add to that the specter of sudden parental responsibility, major conspiracy among MultiCorp and the main character has more than he needs to deal with.The stlye is a bit wooden, but once I was into the flow of the work, I saw that as the way that we all describe our lives to ourselves. I really enjoyed reading this, as I have much of Modesitt's works."
5,Arguably the best value available,"I reach for this volume first among all my dictionaries, even for English spelling -- it's that comfortable to use. The tone is casual and reads native-written (rather than evoking the struggle of an American speaking French).With 55,000+ references and 80,000+ translations, differentiation of French and English dialects, plenty of up-to-date phrases, this is a great all-around choice for the frugal worksmith."
3,"It's a ""Pocket Dictionary"" only if you're a *giant*","Larousse has always been my go-to, and I'm going back to France next month and I wanted just a little something to keep in my bag in case I forgot some common word. This is NOT a pocket-dictionary! Back in the day I *had* one; maybe a 1/2 inch thick and no bigger than an index card, which was mostly what I was expecting. This is a more comprehensive dictionary, about 2 1/2 inches thick and about 4x6 in"
1,Hunk of Junk,"Pieces do not fit and/or stay together. The ""zip line"" is a joke. No need to worry about putting an eye out with the missles....they shoot about one inch. Stay away."
4,Love this,"My nephew also received this one. True the zipline does not work proper but it is a great toy for imaginative play. This was a real nice treat to add to his collection. Best part is everything folded up all neatly and all the pieces are in one place,"
3,Good practice but bad picture quality,"I like the yoga sequence (I did the 80 minute one), Cindy's instructions are clear and nice but the quality of this DVD is very poor. Even the classroom is kind of lame. Maybe I am spoiled by YJ beautiful beaches and mountains but I also own other DVD's in classrooms even one in a living room that are way more inviting than this one. With that said, what I did to get around that was to avoid looking up at the TV I'd rather just listen to the instructions and that seems to work for me. I hope Cindy comes out with other DVD's maybe next time in a more pleasant and realaxing location."
1,OM Yoga,This is not a beginner yoga dvd. There is not enough instruction on how to do each pose or proper breathing techniques. She rarely smiles! I would not recommend this video.
3,"Great Asana, Cyndi Needs to Shut Up","Overall, this is a great Asana with challenging pose sequences.A few gripes:1. The instructor (Cyndi) will not shut up for 5 seconds! It's hard to get into the poses when she is constatly speaking (often times not about yoga at all).2.It gets old. There is really only one class on the DVD and it gets old fast."
1,Not a favorite Yoga DVD,"This DVD does not ""flow"". SHe is not gentle nor slow enough for a beginner and she talks way too much through out.For being able to create your own classes , i thought there would be more to choose from as far as poses. Many of them are the same."
5,A review by an older reader,"Having just written a thesis on Irish Nationalists' administration of the Poor Law, I was very interested to read Conlon McKenna's book, which seemed quite honest in its depiction of the fragmentation of the local social fabric in the Irish countryside during the Famine. As a children's book, it combined the required optimism with some very perceptive social comment. It was a very entertaining read and I'd certainly recommend it for children, and adults too!"
4,Under the Hawthorn Tree,I liked this story. It was about 3 kids who lived in the potato famine in Ireland. I was in Ireland at the time I read the book so I understand what a big part of Irish culture potatoes are. I especially liked the character Eily. Her feelings were so strong but she acted responsible enough so that her brother and sister wouldn't see how upset she really was. She was really brave. I liked the character Peggy too but they don't tell much about her. She reminds me of my little brother. I admire all of them for not letting all the awful things they saw discourage them and they made themselves keep going. I was disappointed that they had to leave. I was surprised when they pulled a stunt to not go to the workhouse. One of the kindest characters in the book was Mary-Kate. She offered to let the children into her house and feed and shelter them. Over all this was a very good book and I would recommend it to many people who enjoy historical fiction books.
1,"Pretty, but doesn't do the job","I gave this charming infuser in a gift to a friend of mine and was there when she first used it. Although the cavity held plenty of tea, it was not diffusing into the water even though we stirred and stirred. She was using boiling water and a dark tea, but even after waiting quite a while the water was barely tinted. The tiny holes around the bottom edges of the ""shells"" are either too few, not big enough, or both! Pretty, but pretty useless!"
5,"A compilation of quotes, reflections, prayers, & poems","A Season Of Grief: A Comforting Companion For Difficult Days by newspaper columnist Ann Dawson is a compilation of quotes, reflections, prayers, poems, and heartfelt sentiment compiled for the specific purpose of offering hope and comfort to those surviving difficult loss. A Season Of Grief is very highly recommended as being an unusually thoughtful collection, with each vignette or passage brief enough for quick browsing, and a volume that presents a variety of differing, yet sincere, perspectives on dealing with the loss of a loved one."
3,"Packing foam, over priced",This is just plain old packing foam. No special acoustical properties. Nothing wrong with it other than it is way overpriced. We throw this stuff away at work all the time.
1,Misleading description,"When shopping for this item, the description CLEARLY stated it was a 3 pack, only one was sent, contacted customer service and they send another one, still one short of a three pack. contacted customer service again and was told that only one was in the item description. Not going to play this game of what I believe is product switching, I think I will cancel my account."
2,Dior Lip color - box office beige,"I already had a tester size of this color. When the full size one came it was packaged in Hong Kong. I was kicking myself - I thought this was a genuine 'from the USA' product (yes I know it is made in France). The color is very similar to the tester size I have, but it is not the same. the new one is slightly pinker in color and has more ""sparkles"" in it. the packaging looks as if it is the genuine article, but now I am wondering whether I wasted my money. I will buy another lipstick when I next go anywhere near a Nordstroms & then I will know I will have purchased the genuine product."
1,ERROR en los márgenes con el Kindle Papperwhite,"No tiene portada, no tiene índice y sobretodo tiene un error de márgenes que hace prácticamente imposible su lectura. ver imágen adjunta.PESIMA EDICIÒN, no pude leer ni la primera página."
2,Excelente novela. Mala edición para Kindle.,Esta es una gran obra de la literatura de todos los tiempos. Lamentablemente la edición para Kindle contiene numerosos errores tipográficos. Resulta muy desagradable comprobar que se ha pagado por un producto defectuoso. Amazon debe tener mayor control y no poner a la venta estas ediciones. Vale decir que no he podido encontrar otra edición digital que no contenga errores también.
3,"Buena traducción, pero con errores tipográficos","La traducción es excelente, pero desafortunadamente esta edición tiene muchos errores de tipeo. Además, se traducen al castellano los nombres de pila, lo que puede no ser del gusto de todos los lectores. (A mí, personalmente me resulta molesto, siempre prefiero que los nombres se conserven en su idioma original, sobre todo si hay muchos que no tienen equivalente)"
1,i ordered a book in spanish and i got a book in english,"im very mad because i ordered this book in spanish and i got it in english,so i have to gave it to my daugheter because i cant read that"
2,Terrible edicion la de kindle para un libro tan maravilloso,"Es triste leer un libro como este en una edicion tan pobre en la ortografia y digitacion. El libro es maravilloso, pero no comprendo como dejan salir un libro digital con tantos errores"
2,Kangarooby Polish,When ordering Nail polish the picture does not show or are you able to tell if it is a frost and not a creme. I would prefer Frosts but hard to tell when ordering til i see it. Would prefer to order frosts only if there is a way of letting me know when i have a polish which isn't a frost as this one was not a frost. Its ok but prefer frosts.
2,Excruciating!,"What a disappointment! The wonderful harpsichordist, Blandine Rannou is totally wasted here. Florence Malgoire's baroque violin suffers from intonation problems. Combine that with lethargic tempos and you have a release best to be avoided.Stay with Fabio Biondi and Rinaldo Alessandrini or Rachel Podger and Trevor Pinnock for wonderfully invigorating and stylish performances.Not recommended!!"
3,Needs An Upgrade!,"Good, but many lines are now seriously dated. Good for introductions and general ideas and some inspiration to play this mega classic opening for black. Perhaps a bit too optimistic for the black side of this long standing, and still unresolved, chess argument."
3,Don't go by the photo,"The battery received was not an APC battery. I don't know if I am having a problem with the UPS or the battery, but according to the UPS's display, the battery is not taking a charge. I gave this 3-stars because I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt that its the UPS that's faulty, not the battery. But I'm not happy with the bait and switch that the battery received was not the APC battery described and illustrated."
5,Go With OEM,"If you are replacing your UPS battery, go w/ this OEM APC replacement battery. Expensive as you know what, but in the end, worth it.I have a SU1000, original battery lasted ~4 years. I foolishly opted for an off-brand replacement, purchased Oct 08. Now dead 11 months later. It was 1/2 the cost and definitely not worth it.Pony up the bucks and go w/ APC."
1,Died after only a few months!!! Not actually a APC product. Untruthful product description,Don't purchase this item. First they said it was an official APC replacement it's it's a generic version. It died in only a few months. Don't trust this company. I'll be reaching out to these guys to get this resolved.
3,This isn't an APC battery!,"Obviously the battery in the picture is a genuine APC battery, but that's not what I received. I received a knock off. It works, but APC will only support their products if they are using a genuine APC battery. On top of this, the hassle of sending back the battery and getting a new one is not worth it."
1,Do Not Last,"1 year and 7 months after installing these batteries, my APC Smart-UPS 1000 UPS is telling me to replace the batteries. Ridiculous!"
5,Good OEM Battery,Good OEM Battery. Installed with no problems. been going good for 3 months now. Price is also very good well packaged.
5,4x4 Lines Post Its,Highly recommend these for those offices that are fast paced and need to jot down a quick note and not loose the note.
1,Invisible post it notes,I was very disappointed in the purchase of these popup post it notes. I was charged for these and received an almost empty box. It had bubble wrap and shipping invoice in it. No post it notes! I haven't received reimbursement or notes from Amazon either. The only way of communicating the problem was to send back the empty box that I could find.
1,Very disappointing,"This may be a good coffee filter - we don't know as it never arrived! Instead, we received a ""Swissgold Tea UNO gold-plated Tea Infuser"" - from the company called ""Home Naturals"" in San Diego, CA. After many emails back and forth, and many promises to send the correct product promptly, we gave up after 4 months.Not happy Jan."
3,not so good,it's not bad but not good also it could never help you with out a cd or an egyptian freind
4,An insightful book into Oceanic art and culture,"In his book Oceanic Art, Nicholas Thomas goes beyond the eye's view of the artwork produced from Oceania, giving the reader the background information and reasons why the distinct works of art were created. Thomas goes through each culture, giving and explaining examples to match the history of each respective culture. I was impressed by the thoroughness of Thomas, not only showing ancient artwork, but photos from Oceania today, as the respective cultures are being preserved. His analysis of the artwork was very well done as he not only explains the artwork, but gives the reader a sense of the culture also. Having studied art, I was impressed with all the examples and pictures in the book, then relating art with history. I would highly suggest this insightful book."
3,You think you'd get more for your money,"When I heard about this book, I was expecting an elaborate autobiography detailing the Sock Puppet's mysterious past. Unfortunately, I discovered too late that it was only a 64-page paperback w/ witty photos and equally witty captions written by the Sock Puppet for each photo.Don't get me wrong - the book is hilarious. But I guess I was expecting much more. This is an extremely fun book to read at a bookstore if you're there with nothing better to do, but only die-hard Sock Puppet fans should make a purchase."
5,Thank you,There was a problem with shipping but they went above and beyond to correct everything!!!!
3,so-so,"I teach art history. This video is ok, not great. I use it to skip around to specific works I want the students to see. The voice over material does not address in any detail: history, aesthetic analysis nor development,nor technique. For example it will say this is a mosaic but not discuss how it was made or materials used.I'm sick of mediocre art history videos. Art 21 is great for contemporary art."
3,It's ok for collecting rather than playing,I purchased this item as a X-Mas gift for my 12-year-old nephew who loves star wars and he loved it. This a nice gift for someone who loves to COLLECT star wars item rather than to play with.
2,DUNCAN HINES BAKE 'N ROAST PAN,"THIS IS A ROASTER PAN . I DIDN'T LIKE IT AT ALL THE FIRAT TIME I USED IT IT GOT SCRATCHED UP , BUT AS MY HUBBY ALWAYS SAY'S U GET WHAT U PAY FOR . THE PRICE WASN'T BAD , BUT IF U WANT SOMETHING THAT WILL LAST THEN U DON'T WANT THIS PAN"
4,A good book - for the right person.,I want to preface this review by saying I liked this book a lot and I would strongly recommend it. It just wasn't an absolutely perfect fit for me.This book would be great for a beginner who is having trouble getting published and wondering what exactly they are doing wrong.The advice in the first half of the book is excellent. The second not so great but it may help you pinpoint exactly what you are doing wrong. Read this book and your work will improve.
2,Sticky Situation,Whatever you do don't try to use this thing for fried eggs. It is slightly textured--I suppose it's so things don't slide off. These little bumps act like velcro when trying to handle eggs. They stick to it and won't let go until they are scraped off.
3,nice spatula,"these look really great ( i have the large and the small), but the nylon turner has gotten a smidge warped over the last six months or so. i never leave it sitting in the hot pan and i don't have a dishwasher, so caveat emptor. otherwise a solid product."
1,insubstantial,"It is advertised as a pancake turner, but it really is not suitable. The material softens and by the third cake it is warped downward and it becomes virtually impossible to flip a average sized pancake with it. Very disappointing."
4,magic school bus explores the solar system,it is a good game for about up to 12 years you have a lot of fun in the games and the whole reason for plying it is to find the frizz on a planet or moon you also find out about all the planets.
4,Play with Barbie on the computer.,"My 5 year old daughter has a lot of fun with this program. You can style Barbie's hair or choose one of her friends. You get them ready for a date, wedding, career or costume party. It keeps my daughter busy because once the hair is done you can do the makeup and choose many other accessories. Once you are all done you can print out Barbies picture. My daughter loves that part!"
4,Barbie Magic Styler,My 4 1/2 year old daughter loves this package. She enjoys changing Barbie's appearance and printing out her masterpieces.
2,It died after 2 years,"In the beginning I thought this blender was a great product; but, my motor died after two years which is a lot shorter than the typical lifespan of a blender motor. I only used it for the normal everyday treats it's designed for. For $20 it's not a terrible price; but, just be mindful that it may not last as long as you may want it to."
1,Black & Decker Sucks!,Their quality has really gone down hill in the past 10 or so years. I bought this (and several other Black & Decker products) and they were all broken and useless within several weeks. Buyer beware!
2,This blender sucks,"Bought this blender for making soup and smoothies.Doesn't circulate the contents through the blender that well.Really loud.And I guess that I was expecting too much from it because the plastic teeth that notch together where the base meets the bottom of the stainless steel plate in the blender cup to make the blades spin, the plastic teeth melted together and started breaking off. Maybe used it a total of 15 times. And the plastic started melting because I was trying to make hummus with canned pre-cooked chick peas. Seriously??? Can't make hummus?Save your money and buy something that doesn't use plastic teeth to turn the blades."
1,I HATE THIS BLENDER!!!,"I never read any reviews before whenever I purchased any products and now I know better. Black and Decker should never make any products! I bought this and was only able to use it a couple of times. First problem was whenever I tried to put the jar in the base, it was hard to do so. And when it blends, it makes such a loud noise. It can be heard outside. I'm not exaggerating! I put up with it because I already purchased it and by the time I used it, it already pass the return date. The worst thing of all, was that even though I was only able to use it a couple of times, that was exactly it, A COUPLE OF TIMES!!! because the motor or whatever died. I was so mad! I threw away the base because it was useless, I kept the jar part and see if I can sell it for the parts. I hate this blender!"
2,cheep but better than nothing.,"I got this tool a few days ago, i wanted to use it a bit befor i reviewed it. cheep constriction and the knife in the tool was dull.""no biggy i can sharpen a knife"" i tryed to use the standard skrewdriver hear to losen a semi-rusted skrew and it bent the tool...really it twisted it! it did remove the skrew and a hammer fixed the bent skrewdriver head so ok. the handle is very thin and im beting from the feel of it it would rust, ""very ruff"" but again no biggy i can buy rustolem paint so ok. i did like the file it was a very useful item, ""strike matches and file off paint from fire starters to make them work"" very nice option. i can say the needle nose plyers are very strong and good quality...just nothing else is, I gave it 2 stars and i think i payed $5.00 for it and its better than nothing, but i just spent $9.95 at a local heardwear store and got the Ozarktrail multi tool and i like it alot better."
4,AN AWESOME COOLER,"I really loved this cooler until a fan issue prompted a call to Chilltec. They sent me a replacement fan without a problem. After receiving the fan, I discovered there was no easy way to replace it. I called Chilltec, who were no help whatsoever, and basically told me I was on my own, offering no help in replacing the fan; again planned obsolescence!"
1,Por favor mi gente...,"Este tipo no sirve, y aunque es cubano y todo eso, no tiene nada...lo unico que hace es tirar el cubanazo, y el cubanazo le sale cool a un chileno...Esta plasmado, esto tipo no se puede comparar con nadie...como van a decir que he represent miami???...este tipo no representa ni pinar del rio...Don dinero??..tremendo jodon, me dio dos millon, para escriberle el track dos...lolHay que darle todo el respeto en este genero a las Boris...Orishas la metio profundo, me se todas las canciones, estan pegado de verdad...pero este tipo, don dinero, vive del ""cubanozo""....no sirve...Tego, Vico, Mexicano, Don Omar, Tempo, Eddie, Lito y polaco...esa gente si la ponen, lo siento patria, pero puerto rico tienen lo mejor de la cochinada esta..."
4,Great opening act by DON DINERO,"I read some of the compliants of this cd and I gotta tell you, it has nothing to do with the music. STOP your crying it's music!! This cd is hot. #2 Don Dinero, #5 Pana Pana, #9 Desahoo del alma, and of course, #14 Where you at? are all great tracks. My only question is: Are you a one cd wonder, or will you last?"
1,bones,"I paid ten dollars for a bone that wasn't even three inches long to be shipped to my house. this was not even worth a dollar, biggest mistake ever"
3,Please tell me what you got!,You made it impossible to purchase the product because YOU DID NOT LIST THE SQ. FOOTAGE FOR THE PRICE.Is there anyone to contact for more information?
3,"A clever story, but mediocre at best","The Pirates Band of Misfits is a nice movie for younger kids. The plot was enjoyable, it is about a group of pirates trying to get the most gold so they can win a contest held by pirates. The queen of England, however, wants every pirate dead until she finds out that this group has a rare Dodo bird. It is nice and well-paced. The problem is animation. It moves at like half a frame per second and looks horrible. Claymation is a hard style to work with, but surely they could do better then this. Nobody wanted to watch even the trailer, so don't ask me how we bought this."
3,Not as good as their other movies,This movie did not keep the kids attention or even mine I fell asleep during this boring movie. I watched this movie with 6 kids and none of them were impressed.
2,"Well, so much for that...","I had high hopes for this one after seeing the trailer months ago, but the actual movie fell very flat, every quickly. While it had a few moments worth a chuckle or two, overall the story felt very thin and flat, the hijinks rather stale, and the overall theme just very ""meh"". I wouldn't say avoid it, but I'm kind of wishing I'd spent my money on something a bit better to relax with after my Thanksgiving feast."
5,Fun with Pirates,"Being a fan of Ardmen Studios creations, I can hardly give an unbiased opinion. I liked the movie. Pure entertainment"
3,Pirates review,"Enjoy Aardman videos, but this one was only so-so. Lacked the satire and humor of Chicken Run, which could be enjoyed by both adults and children. Pirates seemed to lack the multi-generational enjoyment, but still could be perhaps enjoyed by the younger crowd."
3,Kid level intellectually but not adequately engaging,"This movie was cute at times but on the whole a disappointment. The story had potential but its execution was plagued with hackneyed devices and unjustified negative portrayals of real historical figures (Darwin, Queen Victoria). Jokes meant to please parents while keeping the kids engaged were at times cute but not sufficient to save the movie. We got tired during the movie and chose to stop watching, which we just don't do if the film is keeping our interest."
4,Expect more from Aardman,Good movie. Potential was there for more. I hate to think that Grommet is the only top tier character. General production is better than before.
4,Great Kids Cartoon,this was great cartoon. My kids enjoyed and there was nothing I needed to explain or worry about it. Great way to kill a few hours on a raining afternoon or long car ride.
4,Had my 9 year old rolling,"Another great movie by Aardman Animations. If you are a fan of the Wallace and Gromit movies you are sure to love this wacky adventure as well. With the explosion of high tech animation, many feel that stop motion animation is a relic of the past. I feel it is an art-form that stands the test of time. My nine year old is just getting to the age where he starting to understand the humor beyond the slap-stick. This movie is a fun romp that pokes fun of our insecurities; teaches us that our friends can be our greatest allies and that they can help steer us back on course when we have gone astray."
4,"Great animation, Great story, must love Dodos","I viewed this film several times. Each time I found another level of fun, artistic command, and facts inserted to amuse. I recommend this for family viewing and also for the adults who love whimsy, puns and a bit of intellectual entertainment.This film is based upon a series of books about ""The Pirates"" written by Gideon Defoe. I hope that Aardman produces a film of every book!It is both well done and rare to find such quality in films based on a combination of claymation and CGI today.Rent it and buy it. Buy the books too!"
4,"""A FUN-FILLED PIRATE ADVENTURE!""","This enjoyable movie for children reminded me instantly of the Pirate ride in Disney world, with a Pirate show that was very funny as is this movie. Pirate Captain and his crew are simply not the best Pirates in the world. Regardless of their reputation, Pirate Captain embarks on a mission for the 'Pirate Of The Year' contest. He attempts to compete, but the odds are not on his side. He decides to give up the whole idea and heads to England, where he must face more challenges. A fun-filled adventure from beginning to end, and at times hilarious. Animation is good and overall movie is enjoyable. A great summer movie for children!"
2,Disappointment,"I guess I was expecting this movie to be as good as ""Chicken Run"". But it was really lame. I should have rented it first. I will always was a movie first before buying."
2,Just ok,There were a few funny parts but I think most of them made it to the preview. Overall it wasn't that great.
4,"Enjoyable, witty, farce that the family can enjoy together","I was hesitant to purchase without having first seen it, but I took a chance.I'm glad I did, for me it is a keeper and have also bought a copy for a gift. I'd say it's an enjoyable family film, it's witty without having to resort to adult inside jokes like Shrek or Puss in Boots (which are good too, but different humor). Though different from Wallace & Grommit, I think this production still has the same soul in it. Reminds me a bit of old comedy classic films, a kind of Abbott & Costello-ishness, Hugh Grant's Pirate Captain is completely obtuse but comes through in the end."
3,Sloooow,"Boring for myself and for my two 10 year old boys...there were a couple of good jokes, but overall not that great."
4,Pirates as Nerds,"Cute and funny children's flick, with a few laughs for the parents- Good. Kids love stories about pirates, especially when they are witty as this one is. Good casting for the voice-over too."
1,How can a movie about pirates be this bad?,"All the best parts are shown in the trailer, and then you have to sit through 87 additional minutes of boredom. This film isn't just bad, it is REALLY REALLY TERRIBLE."
3,Who doesn't like pirates?,The grand kids enjoyed this film and found the humor to hit the belly laughs too! This group of misfits work hard for the booty.
5,fun movie,"great fun movie for the whole family. stop motion, clay-mation or whatever you want to call it, is an art with a lot of heart and hard work. the 3D is great, the animation is superb and the sorty is fun for all."
3,"Interesting and fun for the kids, blah for their mom","The movie had my kids quiet for a long time ,where I had fallen asleep through this movie. Taking into consideration it IS a kids cartoon movie , I can honestly say it was a great movie !! The kids loved it . The kids laughed. I got a much needed nap."
3,Entertaining for a toddler,"Bought this dvd for our 4 yr. old grandson who likes pirates, the sea and sharks.He really enjoyed the show. My granddaughter who is 8 thought it was only okay."
4,The Pirates,My son loved this movie so much that he watched it about 5 times in one day. Creative story and colorful characters kept him interested over and over.
3,mehh ....,"I guess Pixar has spoiled the world for me. The vast majority of their films are clever, well-written, multi-layerd stories filled with surprising nuances - consider the whole opening sequence of Up, or the underlying themes of the Incredibles or the Toy Story series. I did enjoy the Walace and Gromit films and Chicken Run, but this film seemed to lack whatever they had in common with their computer animated cousins. It felt one dimensional and seemed to leer in your face like some of the poorer children's programing does, instead of the perhaps not too subtle wink at the camera the better cartoons have always had - from Bugs Bunny up through the Tick (animated) and beyond.It wasn't terrible ... it had some moments ... but just didn't do it for me in the end."
4,Fun family movie,"Cute movie for the entire family. Nice soundtrack, if you like Wallace and gromit you'll definitely enjoy this movie. Great job depicting the queen lol."
4,The Pirates! Band of Misfits,My girlfriend and I always enjoy a good animated movie and The Pirates did not disappoint. It had a good story and good clean humor.
2,Could not keep Grandkids attention,We tries to watch it with two 7 year olds and a 2.5 year old. They were bored and uninterested.
2,Well done visually but that's it.,"Well done visually but the story was just uninteresting. Wallace and Gromit shorts & movies, Sean the Sheep & Chicken Run are all brilliant and I've watched them countless times. So maybe my expectations were somewhat high."
2,pirates,"Was not as good as the previews. Pretty disapointed, all the funny scenes were in the previews, glad I didnt go to theaters to see it. The best part was David Tenant (10th Doctor, Doctor Who) played Darwin!My kids didnt even want to finish the movie, they were as bored as I was."
2,kinda expected more,"Kinda expected more from this...... our 9 year old didn't even like it. The accents made it hard to follow a weak/boring plot. We've watched a lot of animated movies in the past 6 years, usually multiple times ;-) this one gotta say not again."
2,Boring,"My wife, son and I all fell asleep while watching this movie. They tried too hard to make it funny.... It wasn't."
2,I never want to watch it again,"Strangely high number of very positive reviews here. The movie was visually stunning, (computer animation enhanced claymation) but poor in story and humor. Charles Darwin and Queen Victoria are the over the top dastardly villains in this, which should give you a good impression of the pervasive wrongness present here. A few chuckles now and again, but nothing to appreciate more on a second viewing. I'm not a kid, so I can't speak with full authority on their potential enjoyment, but I would guess it would be low. All I know is that Wallace and Gromit and Chicken Run are fantastic fun every time, and this was disappointing. Very odd sort of ironic sensibilities here (probably very British humor) that miss more than they hit and are definitely over the heads of younger kids, and a majority of the older ones as well. (also can't speak for the 3D.) Rent, don't buy."
2,Disappointed,"there was some nice adult humor in it, but overall, I was not very impressed with the story-line at all. Found it quite boring once we got through the introductions of the characters and the initial plot."
3,Something was missing,"I enjoy Wallace and Grommit and was hoping for some witty humor in this film that the adults would be able to enjoy while the kids enjoyed the overall film. However, we were both slightly disappointed. While we liked it, the kids said it was just okay. The parents thought there should have been more witty banter in the dialogue."
3,fun kids movie,Kids enjoyed it and I enjoyed watching it with them. Kids may give it higher rating...as im 45 years old
4,Funny.,"This movie was quite funny. The comedy was on the spot, but there weren't too many of them. I think it could have been more funny."
5,Great movie,"This is a great animation in the tradition of Wallace&Gromit, Chicken Run etc. The storyline is great and there are a lot of funny details in the scenery which make it worth to watch it multiple times."
3,Mildly Entertaining.,"This movie was mildly entertaining, not really all that funny.It was different than I expected, the preview made it look like a hilarious laugh out loud during the entire movie funny.It was more of a entertaining adventure story than a funny story."
3,Yo ho ho and a bottle of dumb,"I expected to really like this movie as I love Chicken Run, but it just wasn't what I was expecting. The humor seemed to come in spurts but the stuff that was actually worthy of provoking more than a half-smile just wasn't frequent enough. The animation was pretty good and the storyline was pretty original, but I just didn't get the enjoyment out of this one that I thought I would. Even my kids didn't love this as much as I had hoped they would. They tired of watching it halfway through and found other things to entertain themselves. I suppose if you really love pirates or you really love claymation, it might work. I just didn't think it was as good as the hype."
1,pirates,had such high expectations and this was a complete bomb. I was so disappointed in how bad this movie was. huge wallace and gromit fan. didn't even finish movie.
