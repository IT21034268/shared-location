2,They had all the right ingredients but added too much stupidity,"Despite all the minor plot implausibilities and the fact that Christian Bale has a negligible personality, I was really into this movie until the last 15 minutes or so. The scenery was beautiful, the plot was suspenseful and Russell Crowe was one of the most menacing film villains in memory. The whole effort was then ruined by one of the stupidest endings I've ever seen. Some of the other reviewers go into more detail, but I register my warning for the discerning viewer, of which there are apparently very few out there, judging by the number of 5 star reviews this film has."
1,Bad quality disk,"Won't spoil the ending for you, all in all not a bad movie.However the production quality of the disk is poor, there were 7 places in the movie where things would hang for a few seconds pixellate and then continue.This was first play right out of the box, no fingerprints to gum up the works.Just made badly.Probably won't try to watch it again."
3,Riding the Train Again,"This version of the classic western has fine acting by the principals: Russel Crowe and Christian Bale; but over all the original film with Glen Ford and Van Heflin takes the prize. The ambivalence of the two characters was clearer in the original, with both actors playing against type to a certain extent. Still the new version was worth the ride."
3,a good western for those that don't like westerns..,"I was pleasantly surprised watching this film- yes, it is a ""western"", but the characters are so well-written it's really a character study of the two main characters in the film, as they battle wits against each other.The focis stays on the characters and not so much on the action, although there is action also.The ending leaves the door open for a sequel, which would be welcomed."
3,GREAT CINEMA......but not as a remake.,"There should be a rule that if you wish to do a remake stick to the original storyline. Enhance it with contemporary acting, cinematography, and dialogue. But do not alter the basic elements that made the original worthy of a new version. Otherwise it's not a remake. It's a redo with changes that essentially mock the original.SPOILER ALERTI agree with other reviewers.A disappointing finale.The hero is killed in front of his son and the bad guy has a momwentary epiphany of righteous indignation. To what purpose?The final scene with the horse is what? Crude or dumb humor?The pity of it is that the acting is superb.Special mention to Russel Crowe, and Ben Foster who makes one scary villain.See the original. It holds up and has a much more satisfying ending not to mention Frankie Laine singing the title song."
4,Crowe Does Not Disappoint,"Mr. Crowe's Ben Wade is an outstanding example of why I enjoy watching this actor: his performance is subtle and never over the top, even though it is a role that could easily become so in the wrong hands. He reminds me of Glen Ford in the original movie, which was much less bloody and just as complex, without as much back story provided about the characters. The very end of the movie, when Ben Wade steps into the train, is just about perfect -- not overdone, no outburst of emotion, just a sense that finally Ben Wade can ""enter his house justified,"" to quote from another favorite western movie, ""Ride the High Country."""
4,like,looked like an actual blu ray disc and case compared to other blu ray movie purchases ive made on amazon
2,"more of a western drama than a western, weak movie overall","Decent movie, but definately not anything great. Maybe you could describe it a a western if Dr. Phil or Oprah was directing. Also contains an annoying kid as Christian Bale's eldest son (what is this? The Wonder Years?). Some of the acting is decent, some is bad. There is a lot of weak dialogue. Some terribly bad plot points that leave you shaking your head saying, ""it just makes no sense that that just happened"". Just not an exciting movie. Not a good movie. Not a good western."
2,Not great...,"Crowe and Bale are very good in a servicable update of the original YUMA with Van Heflin amd Glenn Ford; basically they're excellent in a movie that's just OK, and that's a shame - it could've been much better. My problem is that the filmmaker didn't make this the lean, spare western that Elmore Leonard intended. For that, you'll have to rent or buy the original - it tells the same story in a much better way - with 30% less running time (and fat)."
2,Good until the end,Decent western until the end. Ending took it from a 4 star to a two star. Up until then it was just ok.
1,Rented this movie and internet crashed,So I rented this movie on Friday night because I had nothing else to watch and then went to go watch the movie and my internet went down for 24 hours so I couldn't watch it because I clicked play.
4,"Solid western, solid story","I love it when a re-make comes along and it's actually fun to watch! I have to admit I have never seen the original, so I can't make comparisons, but it was a movie that kept my attention and didn't get wrapped up in special effects or excessive cursing, wow!The premise of the story, a son who doesn't show much respect for his father and the father that eventually does want that respect and will go to any lengths to prove to his son he is not weak, is different from most of the westerns I've seen and I guess that's why the movie gets a 4 star rating from me.The locations the film was shot at were very good, looked excellent on blu-ray. My only complaint is like a lot of movies now, you have to turn the volume way up to hear diologue, but when the action starts you have to turn it down or suffer an ear bleed."
2,Not a real western.....,"It was a decent drama, but extremely weak in the Western genre, and IMHO it was boring as hell. Yeah, there was lots of bloodshed but it was all pretty much predictable and very stupid at times. So they have one of the most notorious outlaws in the region, and they have him in handcuffs in front of him. Then at night they have one dopey looking guy watching him. Gee, I wonder what is going to happen."
2,"Cowboys, Interrupted","Pretty much a ""train wreck"" of a movie. The only thing that could have made it worse would be if it had been longer, but at least the door was left open for a sequel.This doesn't deserve a sequel, it deserves a remake, especially by a different director!!"
2,Stupid and Predicatble Hollywood Star Glitz,"The only thing about this movie that is like the original is the title. The entire movie seems like nothing but a way for Russell Crowe to show everyone just how tough, sexy and cool he is. Everyone else in this movie seems like a complete idiot or totally corrupt. Apparently only the bad guys in this movie can shoot straight. Even when the good guys have the upper hand they never take advantage of it. The ending makes no sense at all. Why would Crowe suddenly turn on his own men and kill them? Why wouldn't Bale's character shoot Crowe's character rather than let him escape? And of course at the end they have to leave the impression that Crowe's character can escape from prison because then they can make a sequel for more money. From the impression I got from listening to Peter Fonda in a interview on NPR about this movie I expected a much better movie. Don't waste your time. The whole movie is just an ego trip for Russell Crowe."
4,Great Movie,Russell Crowe & Christian Bale made a very good western. I recommend it to anyone 18 years or older. must watch
4,Still thinking about it,"When I can't decide how I feel about a movie, I figure it must have something going for it. It would be easy to say that I hate Wade and despise Evans, and feel the same about the actors in these roles. However, stepping back a frame or two, I can see a complex situation and some screwed up people ad-libbing it. Kind of like life in Bush America. The final 3 seconds with the horse is what I keep thinking about. Masterful. Wade still holds all the aces. And then I started rethinking from start to finish."
5,Will Join The Classics,"i've been a movie fanatic for nearly 60 years so i've witnessed a lot of celluloid. i consider myself to be somewhat demanding. Looking primarily for a story, followed by good acting and a director who knows what to do with both. 3:10 to Yuma is one of the best westerns ever filmed. there, i said it. it's followed by unforgiven, treasure of the sierra madre and the recent, open range.3:10 to Yuma (Widescreen Edition)"
2,Disappointed with this one!!,"I like a good old fashion western, & this film had all the right elements to be that, the landscapes are beautiful at best, & the characters are well defined, well sort of, the problem I had here was whether or not to root for Russell Crowe's outlaw or Christian Bale's honest farmer, as this film went on I found it hard to like or dislike either man, & Peter Fonda's bounty hunter character was a good role for a seasoned actor like Fonda, but he doesn't seem to become the bounty hunter we know he really is, when Bale is hired to help escort Crowe to a train that will take him to stand trial, you can almost feel as if Crowe is not as bad as he should be, & Bale comes off as uptight, when Crowe sort of redeems himself at the end, you are left with confusion as to why he does what he does, wanted to like it, but found it difficult to like or dislike either character."
2,"Silly, overblown remake of a classic","The original 3:10 was a classic of suspense that actually made sense in the context of westerns as we ""understand"" the west. This one so mangles the story and has such unbelievable twists and turns that it is a waste of time to watch it. A few of the problems: there is an Apache attack at night; Apaches didn't fight at night. The hero, Christian Bale, has lost his lower leg in the civil war, yet at the climax of the film he can run like Jesse Owens. The Russell Crowe character proves how evil he is in a number of ways, but by the end of the movie, he has helped his captors fight off the indians, stayed with them numerous times when he could have escaped, and finally, helps fight off his own gang and willingly gets on the prison train. Too silly for words."
2,"Great action, plot holes you could drive a truck through.","If you don't mind the fact the plot makes no sense, you will enjoy this movie!"
2,Five cliches for every gun shot,"[Spoilers warning!]If you like flicks with lots and lots of cliches, you will enjoy this one. It can be a valuable study guide on how to convert a terrorist with cliches. The converted terrorist will kill his own gang while telling another cliche, then surrender his weapon and lock himself in a cage out of sense of civic duty while his guard is disarmed and dying. It is the happiest ending ever.Cliches make up for the multitude of holes in the plot and for the more discerning viewer there's a scene of drawing a female nude - the same stuff that made Titanic the best movie ever.Seriously: a good flick if you can suspend your brains and not expect anything logical in it."
1,tolerable paralysis,"This movie made me mad about half way through, and I had to stop watching. Either that, or become what I could only describe as ""tolerable paralysis""? What I mean by this is that I'm watching a bad guy do real bad things right in front of a bunch of law enforcement guys that are supposed to be taking him to be prosecuted or something. And the good guys don't do anything but just keep on going without even tying him up. At this point you think to yourself, ""This is not believable."" A good movie is believable, lets you get lost in it. Not this movie... Waste of talented actors on a bad movie.Or, just keep watching with a question mark over your head with a feeling of tolerable paralysis (there's got to be a term for something like this in psychology) as if you just got kicked in the stomach...and your stomach will get better in a few minutes if you just keep watching...But I stopped. I had to stop this intolerable paralysis."
5,Bale rides home what being a true hero is all about!,"3:10 to Yuma was a equally well written story along with a well spread out action film. It was much like the speed of Bourne Ultimatum where it filled you in on what was going on and bringing the characters to light on who they really were. Christian Bale and Russell Crowe make for a great duo that work against eachother, for eachother. Bales character doesnt like Crowes character but they feed off of eachother to get through to the next challenge. This deffanitely brought back to mind watching the old westerns with The Duke and those spaghetti westerns with Eastwood. It was a wonderful ride that I would take into the sunset time and time again."
1,Disappointing western,Not a good movie. Good cast reduced to rubble by a very bad script. And the audio was bad -- it seemed that about 90% of the dialogue was whispered.Don't waste your money on this one!
1,Do NOT catch this train!,"The only Western film I have ever seen worse than this one is the all-midget ""Terror of Tinytown."" The original 1957 film was boring but still head and shoulders above this one. At every key point in the plot the characters behave in completely uncharacteristic ways. The low point of the film is the scene where the bad guys line up in the street below the hotel window and dialogue with the good guys in the room above them. In real life, when bad men who are trying to kill you get this close and hold this still you start shooting them, not engaging in meaningful social intercourse. When the Indians attack the camp of the whites, nobody puts out the campfire that makes it easy to shoot them. The outlaw gang keeps coming after their leader when the intelligent thing to do is to split up the loot and get the hell out of the territory. This film stinks worse than a poisoned water hole and you would do well to ride a wide circle around it."
1,The worst western ever,"Western movies are, at their best, about strong individuals who face challenges and make their own luck. The character played by Christian Bale is a girly man and it is just painful to watch this movie."
2,Psychological thriller didn't work in this REMAKE OF A Western.,Sometimes the best thing to say is nothing at all - especially when you're talking to sociopath. ....... ............. ............ ........... ........... .
1,Terrible and Disappointing,"When i began watching this movie I thought it was a great movie. Wades gang was loyal and willing to die for him. Unfortunently Wade was very weak and survived only by munipulation. Wade's second in command got his hat back for him, got his gun back for him, rallied the gang only to free the imprisoned Wade, for Wade only to turn on him and his etire crew in the end for shooting christian bale who was trying to take him to prison. Wade(Russel Crowe) is very fake in this movie. The pity this so-called ruthless, rotten, killer has for this rancher is unbeliveable. But if you don't believe the review, go check it out. If you like it I know what kind of morals you have."
3,Not very good,"Let me begin by saying I love Russell Crowe and Christian Bale, but both of them have to be embarrassed at having been a part of this totally stupid film. If you're a grown-up with a fourth grade education, then this movie was made for you. Everyone else unfortunate enough to sit through it will leave scratching their heads and wondering ""WTF""."
1,Western pop - waste of your time,"Bad baddy makes connection with good goody whose life is saved by his teenage son when threatened by bad baddy said baddy then gives peace a chance after obliterating whole town and its marshals while waiting to be put on a train.Sure, Westerns can be fantasy and the good guys can dodge 300 bullets and kill with one quick shot in return but this movie has nothing going for it except bleeding hearts and utter nonsense which will waste your valuable time.Russell Crowe plays a cool calm known-all baddy with a worldly education and his opposite is a broken down rancher a dumb but morale crusader for his bit of dirt and in between are hacks from both sides dodging bullets, bribes, apaches, and no doubt boredom with their lines.There is nothing credible about this bit of wasted energy and unnecessary greenhouse gas."
1,Great story with Unacceptable language...strong cursing..,I chose this rating because of all the cursing and bad language. I had seen the movie on TBS and the language was removed. Story was great but was spoiled by the language..was unable to show to grandchildren
2,Where's Clint when you need him?,"Well, if the Western isn't dead, it won't be because this film has revived it. More of an American homage to Sergio Leone and the Spaghetti Western era, particularly with an ending that would make even the Spaghetti King himself weep. But Russell Crowe here is no Clint Eastwood. This is one of his weakest efforts to date. Christian Bale is far more watchable here but still isn't strong enough to carry the film on his own back. The film has it's moments but whatever meaning might have been made out of its parts destroyed by an ending so incredible that it crosses over the border into comedy."
2,why all the hype.....,"I thought this movie was long and boring. Foster, Crowe and Christian all act wooden. The script was bad and the direction had no direction."
1,not good until the end,"I had heard this had made many critics' top ten lists for the year it was made, so I finally snatched up a copy without looking too hard at the cover.Whoops. I had promised myself never to watch another Christian Bale movie after that inexcusable tantrum of his (where he was yelling at some hapless D.P.) hit the internet. Oh well. Have to be more careful next time.The movie was hard to enjoy, since there was very little to admire in any of the characters . . . even after the supposedly redemptive ending. Sure, the final scene trying to get him on the train was fairly gripping, but even that had the rug pulled out of it after the bandit chief confesses that he's previously escaped from Yuma prison twice already. That was a huge scripting mistake, I feel: it make all the proceedings -- and all of the sacrifices we're supposed to be caring about -- utterly pointless."
4,not as good as it could have been,the movie left me flat at the end...not too bad up till then...for me i hate bad endings
2,Double Disapointment,I was very disapointed with this blu ray disc. First the movie- Although I enjoyed the dialog the action was below par. Westerns simply don't work these day because of all the special fx in movies. With a lo fi action it just seemed like a made for tv movie.(low budget). The plot was simple and offered no twists. The ending was ridiculous to the point of being laughable.The Blue ray disc- terrible. There was lots of ghosting effects in dark scenes. Lots of grain in the light scenes. And distortions in the close up scenes.In conclusion I regret buying this disc and should have rented on Netflix first. The only positive is Crowe and Bale and watching Luke Wilson get shot.
2,Big Disappointment!,"I have always loved westerns, and my favorite westerns, by far, are the great classics from the 1950s, including Delmer Daves' 3:10 TO YUMA. That 1957 movie had superb acting, and you really cared about what happened to the characters. It also had a very satisfying ending.James Mangold's 2007 remake of 3:10 TO YUMA also has superb acting, but the almost continuous and extreme violence turned me off to the point that I couldn't have cared less about what happened to the characters and how the movie ended. In fact, the ending is nothing short of ludicrous.Unless you love lots, and I do mean lots, of violence, I would suggest that you skip the remake and buy the original."
2,Disappointed,"Christian Bale. Russell Crowe. This movie has to be good, right? Wrong!!The story is dull and farfetched. No way is this film as good as ""Unforgiven"".I was expecting a much better movie."
4,An enjoyable western.,After watching this a 2nd time I've changed my comments. This is a very good western. Russell Crowe and Ben Foster do a great job.
3,Didn't earn it's death,"Not to give it away, but ""3:10 To Yuma"" has a last minute death that is both upsetting (but that's okay, because I'm an adult and I understand that happy endings are not always the best) and dissapointing. The issue is that when you spend 2hrs watching characters barely escape death over and over to just have on up and get killed suddenly at the end it has to be a damned well deserved death.What leads up to the end is really a top notch film, both Bale adn Crowe give solid performances and the film never feels overly Hollywood fantastical, it's a pretty gripping, intense film.Unfortunately the character arch of the Crowe characters is predictable from the start, his fate feels obvious and you might wish Bale's character would be a bit stronger or smarter in the last twenty minutes.Still, a good film for it's flaws, but not one you watch over and over like ""Unforgiven."""
4,310 To Hell,"310 to Yuma is a great western, the whole cast does a great job, this is the best Peter Fonda has been in a long time, I think its the best Russel Crowe has been since Gladiator. i wasnt sold on Christian Bale now i like Him. 310 remimded me of Clint Eastwoods westerns, its dark and violent like High plains drifter, the Physco killer from the Wade gang was played briliantly. The young man who played Dan Evans son does a great job. 310 follows the original closley the parts that are different make it better. Love the widescreen format."
1,A Noble Horse Had To Die For This Crap!,"A horse was killed during the making of this turkey, an animal who no doubt had more talent in his hindquarters than everyone involved in this terrible movie determined to once and for all kill the Western!Crowe has done nothing but make TERRIBLE movies since Gladiator and Beautiful Mind. Master & Commander (with a sequel in the plans. GAG!!!), all the gangster movies, the terrible boxing movie, now this. I give up. He was my favorite actor, but I ain't wasting any more money on his choice of movies.Yes, so many plot holes and inconsistencies, I'd have to watch the wretched thing again with a pad and pen in my hand. One thing that stood out was his having dinner with the Christian Bale character's family, cuffed in front, given a KNIFE! I was waiting for him to start slashing up the family in a ""3:10 To Friday The Thirteenth"" gorefest.Yes this is one of those gems where you have friends over, get some drinks, laugh at all the flaws and throw food at the TV."
4,3:10 to Yuma,"Just hearing that this was based on an Elmore Leonard story,he also wrote Hombre, was enough to get me interested. I never saw the original with Glenn Ford which I think was a plus. It gave me the opportunity to watch without prejudice. Bale and Crowe are excellent and bring their characters to vivid life. The story has a High Noon, ""a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do"" vibe which makes it compelling and thought provoking, much like Unforgiven. A must see for Western fans and anyone who enjoys a good story well told."
3,Entertaining but...,"First of all this is a very entertaining film if you can just turn off you logic sensors. I liked it, the action was good, and the moral dilemmas were good but were stretched way to thin.Crowe as the renaissance villain was just overplayed until in the end became ridiculous.I think, maybe (and this is just me) but that the concepts of honor and such may be kind of incomprehensible to some in Hollywood at this point so that often they can't convey them in a way that can make sense.I can think of two Westerns in recent years that did a much better job at what this film tried to do. If you liked this film, go Get ""Open Range"" and ""Missing"" and I think you will be happier, but still 3:10 to Yuma was not a bad way to spend a couple of hours."
5,"3:10 To Yuma, a real western","3:10 to Yuma is the best western film to come along for a long time. Christian Bale's charactor is an ex soldier down on his luck, his farm is dried up his cattle are dying he is loosing the respect of his family and a goldening opportunity presents itself all he has to do is take one of the deadliest outlaws Russell Crowe to meet the 3:10 train to Yuma prison.Beautifully shot awesome scenery great towns just looked really authetic. The best acting talent from two of the best male actors in my opinion plus a great performance from Peter Fonda as a Pinkerton bounty hunter. If you are choosing to buy a western movie this is the one to get,forget the other one thats just been released ( with Brad Pitt )you will be disappointed if you don't buy 3:10 to Yuma."
1,"I did not order any ""On Demand Video"".","I was trying to place an order for five DVD's (3:10 to Yuma being one of them) to send to my brother for Christmas. But, the ship-to-address was wrong on the order so I cancel all the items. Then I get this email showing that I ordered a ""Video on Demand"". I DID NOT ORDER A VIDEO ON DEMAND. What happened? sorry & thanks,"
5,Great version,"Russell Crowe is great in this one. I liked the cinematography, the other plausible characters and a realistic period history."
2,Disappointed,"This movie combined to fantastic actors: Russell Crowe and Christian Bale, so I was hoping for a better movie. In keeping with the decline of American Cinema, this movie is chalked full of vulgarity and unnecessary violence. I was just really hoping these guys would combine their superb acting skills to produce a movie that is clean yet incredibly thrilling and entertaining.... they didn't."
3,A Good Modern Western,"This was a rather fine movie. However, the violence was somewhat intense. This film was meant for mature audiences. All in all, it was an enjoyable film."
2,Good Acting But Rediculous Plot,"I was dissapointed with 3:10 To Yuma,the acting and cinematography were good but the plot was rediculous.The film starts off good but when Russell Crowe starts killing good guys and the others do nothing is when the film lost me.If 3:10 To Yuma is the future of westerns then let me off at the next town so I can watch a Clint Eastwood film."
3,A Little Disappointing!,"With all the positive reviews for this film, I was expecting a lot better. Christian Bayle is a cattle rancher who witnesses a group of bandits robbing a bank coach. The lead robber (Russell Crowe) lets him go, however Bayle ends up joining a group of lawmen that are after the bandits for over 20 robberies.There is a lot of cat and mouse between Crowe and Bayle and by the end they have developed a relationship that reminded me of Crowe and Denzel Washington in American Gangster.A good deal of the movie is slow and the ending left me shaking my head."
2,Didnt quite get there.......,"This movie didnt quite get there for me. Compare it with something like 'The outlaw Josey Wales'? Doesnt come close does it. Really hoping that this would be a ripping good western, must have had the budget, good people, acting not bad, nicely filmed....... butI think the reaction from the lads at the bar when I got the movie and asked them if they had seen it ""Yeah not bad but..."" pretty well sums it up. Shame as was hoping as its been a while since a great Western came out.... Clint still rules!"
5,"well done, but not really a remake","Really enjoyed this movie. Russell Crowe and Christian Bale were great as usual. the original with Ford and Heflin was one of my favorite westerns, so was glad to see this remake, but it is not really a remake of that old classic...it has many changes. The basic plot is the same, that's all. that being said, just enjoy it as a great western all on it's own. very well done! not much not to like if you like westerns!!"
4,Western Movie Fan,"Classic western movie remake with stunning photography in hi definition blu-ray format. Great casting of Bale and Crowe, a surprise guest star performance by Peter Fonda, and the top-notch acting award goes to the movie's ""bad dude"" portrayed by Ben Forster. I highly recommend this action western. It is a keeper for your blu-ray library."
5,"Awesome acting, fantastic film!!!!","I loved this movie more than I thought I would. I sat down prepared for another ""western"" i.e. Unforgiven. But this was something different. I've never seen the Glenn Ford version so I can't compare. Christian Bale's ""Dan"" was portrayed to perfection, well underplayed. Russell Crowe was awesome as always- Crowe's not let me down since ""The Quick & the Dead"". Bale's raw fortitude and the subtle interplay between the two really drew me in. I was especially moved by the relationships, however mysterious. To me Unforgiven, while wonderfully cinematic and entertaining, you could see coming a mile away every step of the way, just my personal opinion. 3:10 to YUMA however kept me on the edge of my seat emotionally. **Spoiler alert** Folks in our house disagreed about the ending... some disliked that Dan died, and others thought it was moving the way it played out. I'll be watching for new movies starring Crowe and/or Bale."
3,A good shoot 'em up...,"As far as contempary westerns go this is good enough to satisfy. It isn't for the whole family, of course. It has all the gun action, and good guy against bad guy stuff,but with a twist you will need when renting it. Crowe does a good job at being the black hat. Crowe and Bale breathe life into this remake and do a great job at their acting skills.A man being forced from his farm takes a risk in taking a captured fugitive in for trial. He puts his life on the line like a true hero."
2,3:10 to Yuma,"Hungry for more westerns, like most folks I would guess.My first thought of Russell Crow in 3:10 to Yuma a modern made western was a bad vehicle of choice. (Like re-doing Easy Rider). I had recently seen the original with actors Glen Ford and Van Heflin. Their just no comparison to the original in performances and drama. The kill all at the ending was like James Mangold just didn't know how to end the film. I will not be waiting to see it again on TV. Instead I'll pay to rent the original over and over again unless I buy it. I have about 600 Movies collected.This new 3:10 to Yuma will not be added to my list. Although I do enjoy Russell Crow and Christian Bale's work, But not in this film. I seen the origial."
4,Love is reserved....,"A western has to be of a certain caliber for me to like it and I love the Eastwood Spaghetti Westerns. I really liked this movie, all the characters were very well played and I was invloved with every scene all the time. I rarely buy a movie with all the rental options but I did want to buy this one, GREAT movie.As the title says, Love is reserved for only close family member and a couple of movies in a life time, while I really like this one, I don't love it."
4,A good remake at last. Even if...,"I love the original very much. I love it so much I was reluctant to look at this one, especially because I had less pleasure with the remakes of these past 15 years than with the former versions.Now, I must admit that I like this new one too, even if the soundtrack, in my opinion, was not there.Great landscapes, excellent play, interesting journey which enters new tracks. And, at the end, the main characters who are not pure black or white. Much more realistic, in some way like in ""Unforgiven"" even If this new train is not at the Eastwood's movie level.Of course, as Clare Quilty underlined it in these website, there is many, many incoherencies (perhaps a little to much). But, as far as they are concerned, they did not diminished my interest for the movie.And, by the way, if we had to count all the incoherencies which exist in so many movies, even in the greatest ones, especially westerns..."
2,It has been said here,"I also wanted to to like this movie ""remake"". But as others said, it is an exercise in implausibility in so many dumb and displeasing ways."
4,A real mans western,"Despite its flaws, Yuma is still an extremely entertaining and thought provoking western, even if its not quite up to par with the classic ""Unforgiven"". While there are some unexplainable elements concerning the motives for the characters at the end, especially Crowes, its still refreshing to see a western where the guys would like to see some of themselves in the toughness of the characters as well as the actors portraying them. Crowe and Bale are the perfect actors to pull off these parts. If you want men who swing a different way than the men in Yuma, go rent Brokeback Mountain. Theres no room for the likes of wimpy boy gyllenhall in a tough guy movie like Yuma."
1,This is one crap movie.,"It's kind of hard to add anything to that. This is just one stupid movie. I can't be bothered to add anything more, I was so disgusted by this pile of technicolor horse dung."
3,The Tempts Before David Ruffin,"Motown was not truthful about this album in 1964; it represented a culling of three years or so of unsuccessful singles by the Temptations, with their new hit ""The Way You Do The Things You Do"" added on. Apparently word got around, so the label was forced to include ""The Way"" on the group's second album, ""The Temptations Sing Smokey"". Elbridge Bryant, who preceded David Ruffin in the group, did not sing lead; most of these songs feature the great Eddie Kendricks."
3,The Men OF Soul,"I enjoy the Temptations in everything they do this is the start of them singing and I love ""Check Yourself"" and played it alot. All the songs are not bad on this cd I enjoyed listening to the beginnings of the Temptations."
1,What happened to the promised free rip to the cloud?,"I cannot find this on my cloud player, it was supposed to be a free rip and I don't see it."
3,"While some info out of date, a great place to start.","Cycling the wine country if France is ideal cycling, ideal living. The French love cyclists and while the more French you have the better, this little book will help you over some of the humps."
2,misguided purchase,"accidentally thought this was the soundtrack for ever 17, turns out it was something else completely."
5,New Classic!,"The best short term trading book you can get. If you trade the markets and don't know anything about pivot points, YOU MUST READ THIS BOOK!!! If you don't trade the markets but are thinking about it, YOU MUST READ THIS BOOK!!! Excellent information on technical analysis without being too technical:)"
5,Geat Hidden Jem,"This book is a gem... great discussions on the lesser known areas of trading. Of course, this book does a great job of covering the standard indicators in a very well thought out fashion. But the real power J. Person's book lies on the chapters on crowd behavior, and going against the grain of the ""talking heads.""I greatly enjoyed this read, and know I will be implementing many of the ideas in my own trading. Trading Tactics is a must read for all, novices as well as seasoned professionals will find something useful within its pages...SB"
5,Off the Hook..!!,"I was brought up hearin this type of west coast s***.. I have to say that #7, and DAY of the DEAD is hittin hard.. yu can find that track on one of the Ghetto 2 tha Barrio sountracks.. I think. :/"
4,Cryptopsy - Blasphemy,Songs Include : Defenestration / Abigor / Open Face Surgery / Born Headless / Serial Messiah / Swine Of The Cross / Gravaged / Memories Of Blood / Mutant Christ / Pathological Frolic
4,good but not the best in my book,"This is a good cable, but when compaired to a Monster it just don't have the sound and clarity..I just wanted to see the difference in the two cables..the gold is 25 feet and the monster is 21.both are straight and angled 1/4 inch ra ends. I have the mic cables and insturment cables in both brands..I'll be sticking with the Monsters, and give my grandson the Mogami Golds. That's that."
5,The Right Stuff,"The music on this cd is fabulous. I am able to listen to it from beginning to end. It has upbeat as well as slow songs, also some of the song are instrumental. It is great for a nice relaxing evening or romantic."
4,Ten stars for the number 6 cut... the rest is just okay.,"Recently some friends asked for help in putting together music for their wedding reception. As I was thinking of my favorite songs of love and marriage I thought of a song that I hadn't heard in a very long time, ""Love of Mine"" by Stuff.I looked on Amazon and although the original CD's by Stuff are out of print this compilation CD had my song so I bought it. I played ""Love of Mine"" 40 minutes to work and an hour back, over and over.Now the rest of this CD is just a bit better than average jazz, but nothing great. However, what a great song! I am happy to spend the money to own this song again and to help keep it in print."
5,Fast shipper used item in great condition,"Received this pretty speedy, faster than most . packaged well. would buy again from seller"
3,Not very Mac friendly and needs more updating for 7,"Not a bad book just not very Mac friendly. Seems a bit slapped together from previous books. Lots of PC shortcut key strokes which don't work for Mac. It would be ok if he would at least also say where to find the action just done in the menus but instead you spend lots of time trying to find it yourself. As I understand there isn't alot different between 6 and 7 but in the book there were several instances where his exercises just didn't work in 7. Not a great beginner book but if you have a PC and have used lightwave 6 I'd say get it. Reading the forums might have saved me $... Oh well, live and learn ... ok maybe ""learn"" is too strong of a word regarding this book."
5,The Best Choice to the distant users and studants,"If you realy want to learn LightWave 7 you don't need anything else. In Brazil the people only find basic curses and with this book I find just what I needed to catch all its complex concepts. Detail: I'm a beginner student and I think that the ""language"" of the author fits very well for any type of user. Congratulations to Dan Ablan and Amazon and thanks to make it possible.Sorry my bad english..."
5,"Look no further, you have found it.","Inside Lightwave 7 covers all the bases. From the simplest procedures, to complex methods of creating professional looking images and animation in Lightwave. It does so, in an easy to read format. Whether you're just starting out in Lightwave or a salty industry veteran, you will find this book valuable. You'll never look at your Lightwave manuals again."
5,the best i've ever read,i've tried a lot of software specific 3d books in the last time but dan ablan is definitly the best. easy to read and much more easier to understand. together with newteks original manual it a power combination that works perfectly. for me it's sure that i preorder the forthcoming titles from dan ablan.
5,How to utilize all of LightWave's numerous functions,"With Inside LightWave 7, award-winning animator and LightWave author Dan Ablan, presents a superbly organized and invaluable ""how to"" instructional reference manual that will prove to be an invaluable, long term resource, especially for the novice user. Inside LightWave 7 has been written to anyone quickly up-to-speed and enhance their productivity with NewTek's LightWave 3D software version 7.0. Packed from cover to cover with authoritative and accessible information, Inside LightWave 7 provides clear, step-by-step tutorials, and a wealth of helpful tips from beginning to end. Perhaps the single most comprehensive instructional text available on NewTek's latest technology, Inside LightWave 7 deftly teaches how to enhance the skill set and to utilize all of LightWave's numerous functions. Inside LightWave 7 is enhanced with the inclusion of a CD-ROM with working demo of LW 7. 1200 pages."
5,Now this is how a LightWave book should be written!!!!,"I have the other LW books, and they're ""OK"" - but they really don't cover much LightWave 7. What they do cover is basic. Enter Dan Ablan's fantastic ""Inside LightWave 7"" book. I was shocked when the UPS man brought the box - the book is huge! I don't know how I'll get through all of the info Dan's packed into it. This book is well written, clear, and insightful. I've found info on just about anything I can think of. I'm learning lightwave and earning money thanks to this book. All I can say is buy it - it's the best investment you can make these days."
1,If u got 6 u dont need 7 - save your money!,"i just got the book, well, nothing new. even the young woman's head tutorial is the same! what a shame!"
3,Not enough detail.,"I have all three of the Inside Lightwave Books. This one has some strong points, but it doesn't go far enough in explaining how to use Motion Designer for one. Making a cape is not my idea of clothing. What about explaining how to make an entire long sleeved outfit that has buttons and pockets. There is no mention of the replacement plugs for doing that, nor any coverage of geometry problems with actual clothing. This book is good for the intermediate, but is lacking for detail."
2,Not recomended for the easily frustrated,"Credit has to first be given where credit is due. For Dan Ablan to take on such a huge task of trying to teach people how to use a program as complicated as Lightwave is commendable. But it seems that once again the publisher New Rider has dropped the ball. This book like Inside Lightwave 6 is chocked full of errors. It would be nice if New Riders or Dan Ablan would hire someone to do the tutorials and check for errors before a book like this is published. All I can say, after waiting for months for the release of this book is --- ""I am disappointed."" And in my humble opinion I would not recommend this book until the errors have been fixed or at least Dan's Website has put up the definately upcoming errata page to fix errors."
2,Overrated and Overpriced,"First, I want to say this isn't a bad book. But considering what other people have said about it -- that it is the ""LightWave Bible"" -- I believe it is highly overrated and unquestionably overpriced. Nine times out of ten when I'm looking for something I'll find it in the manual (which is quite good) instead of in here. Especially as the index is almost completely useless.The manual, not this book, is the definitive source for using LightWave. You should buy it only as an auxilary source of information. And only if you have money to burn."
3,Good and bad,This film is fairly interesting. I found this to be a useful intro into a metal sub-genre that I've never heard of. The musical aspect of the film is great but the filmmaker starts to shift away from the musical focus about halfway through and starts asking questions that don't really seem to belong in a musical documentary. The intro the film makes absolutely no sense. I think shorter clips of the bands would have been a better use of footage. Some musical sections are too long. My recommendation is to watch this before you buy it. Look for it online or on youtube.
4,good!!,Pros:A number of very good bands performing and being interviewed. The interview questions are often funny and the responses are hilarious.Cons:1. Not enough bands. Many key bands missing of course. 2. Would have been better with more (and shorter) clips of live performances. And less time spent on primordial who is perhaps least known. 3. Pointless jab at homosexuals at the beginning of the film. Not done by any of the bands but the filmaker i guess.Overall:Number of cons here but they are fairly minor. i recommend this for anyone who likes silly interviews and documentaries. Highly recommend it if you like heavy metal. A must see if you like pagan/folk metal.
5,Perfect G1 replica,This is exactly what I have been looking for.If you are looking for a G1 Megatron from your childhood this is as close as you can get.I was thrilled with reproduction and quality.I felt like I was 7 again.All the extra accessories are a HUGE bonus.This one shoots little bullets and has his energy mace.
4,Transformers Takara collection #6 Megatron,This is the closest to the original you will ever get! Although all reissue transformers are inferior to the original japanese versions in my opinion. Takara is now manufacturing these toys in China . They are close to identical but the craftsmanship and quality control is nothing compared to the 80's Versions. But they are overall good quality reissues.
5,A must own dvd,"If you love Transformers then you must own this Toy,Yes it is a remake but it looks great and down the line it will be worth something.It looks like the original and when they remake something that looks so good you must own it."
4,A definate keeper! Couldn't put it down!,I really enjoyed this book. You can definately relate to the charactors. Great detail...loved it!
5,I want some more of that...,"This was a knock-out first book. Humourous, full of adventure and intrigue, and perfect chemistry made this romance a pleasure to read. I can't wait for more Debra Mullins!"
2,I'm sorry to say it -- disappointing.,"I bought this book hoping for a delightful romance with the added spice of adventure. What I got instead was an odd hybrid with far too many cliches. The writing was acceptable, and I'm sure Ms. Mullins' work will improve. Unfortunately, this one didn't quite make it for me."
2,"so tiny, no mom would wear this around her neck","I love Amazon, but I have been disappointed with my jewelry purchases, as I have found the items to be much smaller than they appear in the ad. This ""charm"" was smaller than my fingernail. No one would even be a able to read what is says. I bought this to give to my mom, but I returned it."
3,Love da Girly Rawk,"FINALLY.... a female fronted artist with a voice of her own, some good material, and a band that brings the RAWK. Some poignant moments as well as some overdone moments. Good debut."
5,yay,"There are a lot of advantages to Toward the Within's Live factor. It seems to take you right to the live performance, and from there to a dimension all their own. Dead Can Dance infuse goth with world folk into a shamanic, ethereal sound that is tinged with music of Native America and Persia. The album is beautifully different."
5,One word....WOW!!,"I wish so much I could have been there when they were touring America...It sounds so much like your right there listening to them.Dead Can Dance is one of the most talented artists I have ever heard. I love their music, and I feel this album is a great piece to add to the collection."
5,This CD is a piece of jewel--it's a rarity!,I happened to hear a couple of songs from this CD at a dance club. The music just makes my juice flowing. I guess I mean that listening to this CD makes me feel very alive. This kind of music doesn't ever get played on radio stations. I highly recommend it.
5,I only have one thing to say about this album...,This is simply the most beautiful music I have ever heard!
3,assistance please,"Assistance please ... I am Julie Ridge and wonder how this entry was authored. It was referenced to me by a friend. I didn't know it existed. The information in the entry is over 20 years old. I'd love to be able to provide updates, especially because it appears to have been written in 2004. Please let me know how to contact the author. Thank you.Julie Ridge, LCSW - 1956 - ..."
4,Pristene Production / Extremely Marketable,"Honey to the B is quite a bit similar in arrangement to All Saints, and has a pristene production. Sleek Video, very very marketable and needs to get some attention in the US very very soon. This girl will make huge amounts of money for her record label and definately be in the same category as the Britney production. I'm not saying they are fantastic vocalists, they are very good, and they have got major label $$$$$ backing."
4,i think Honey To The Bee was the best song all year!!!!!!!!!,i think the song honey to the b is a really good song & would really recommend it.billie has really nice clothes as well whoever sas she is TRASH GET A LIFE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,I luv it,"After suffering through the likes of American ""teen divas"", I really enjoy listening to Billie's CD. This is a fantastic Cd, full of funk and r'n b with some pop to go along. 'Girlfriend' 'She Wants You' 'Honey To the Bee' and 'I Dream' are FANTASTIC tracks. Billie is having a new cd come out and I absolutely cannot wait. Hopefully the US will see the light- the UK and the rest of the world certainly has!"
1,didn't like it at all,"Not one song stood out for me. I bought it, listened to it, and immediately returned it. I read in other reviews here that her second album, Walk of Life, is better."
2,DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT COMPARING HER TO BRITNEY,"Okay, i don't exactly have the album, OR Britney's album, but i have heard the songs on both albums, and i must say that Britney has MUCH more talent. I mean, comparing Britney's single ""Baby One more time"" to Billie's single ""Honey to the Bee"" is just stupid cuz Briteny's song is sooo much more catchier and cooler. ALSO, have u seen Britney dance?? Billie could NEVER in a million years dance like her. She'd probably fall flat on her face."
1,Trash!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Gheez, another trash from England! How come there is no longer talented singers like Annie Lennox or Dina Carroll from the Brits? Please, do not buy this CD as I did, when I was vacationing in Austarlia. Anybody want mine???????"
1,Pants,"This album is a disgrace to the word ""music"". How anything so abysmally poor can be released to buy for the general public, let alone be recorded, is mystery to any half musically educated person on the planet. How the public is brain-washed into spending 14 pounds on this is beyond me. My message to the people of the world is ""Buy proper music!!"""
1,Tragic!,"I cannot understand how anyone can give this CD five stars! Where albums usually have a few 'fillers' every single track on this CD has that quality. Overly manufactured pop music and the lyrics? ""Will you be my boyfriend"", ""We sing and dance all day because we want to"" and, well all of the lyrics make it more suited to the Olsen twins rather that a 17 year old."
2,A waste of money,"I don't like ""Honey To The B"". I dunno why I bought it, maybe because I was young and I used to like ""Because We Want To"". I must admit Billie chose the right singles, I like them all but Girlfriend, in fact this song is very insipid, then figure if it has to be a single!!! I found all the songs very boring, I didn't like the music and the beat. Anyway, I think there's something to save. As I've already said the single were ok, that is to say because We Want To, She Wants You and above all Honey To The Bee. I don't understand why this song is together with the others in this collections, it's so beautiful and different from the others!! But my fav song is absolutely I dream. Another song which hasn't anything to do with the others. It's a wonderful midtempo track and Billie's voice sounds good! I think Billie can sing, it's a pity she gave up singing. It's also a pity I didn't buy Walk Of Life instead of Honey To The Bee, in fact her second and last album is better!!"
4,Billie is the tops!,"This CD is absolutely awesome! I like Billie's songs and voice way more than Britney Spears! Some of my faves from this CD are: Honey to the B, She Wants You, Party on the Phone, Girlfriend, and Because we Want to! It is awesome music to blast in the car, dance to, party to, or whatever! I will never get tired of this CD! If you want a little sample of Billie, get the Pokemon CD first and get addicted to her there..."
5,billie is so adorable...,"i saw billie's video ""because we want to"" when i worked at a clothing store and fell in love with her! i got a friend in the UK to send me a copy of her album and i love it. it's so addicting. i especially love ""girlfriend"" ""she wants you"". much better and charming than the crop of teen fems out here in the us right now (namely britney)."
3,Billie is okay.,"Billie is a lot like that Britney Spears. But while I would give Britney's""Baby One More Time"" one star,Billie gets three.Billie has a good pop/r&b kind of sound."
4,A pretty good CD,"""Because We Want To"" was the first song I ever heard of Billie, and I absolutely LOVED it! But I don't know why so many people are comparing her to Britney! Britney has a great voice and all, but I prefer Billie over her. There are a few songs on the album that I don't like (namely ""Saying I'm Sorry Now"" and ""Whatcha Gonna Do"") but I love mostly all of them, including ""Because We Want To,"" ""Girlfriend,"" ""She Wants You,"" ""Party on The Phone,"" ""I Dream,"" and ""Don't Forget to Remember."" But no matter what style of song she's singing, Billie sings all of the songs on this album VERY well. Not something everyone would like, but I still love it!"
2,Singles are better!,"I think that she is a good artist, but I think that the produced tracks on her album were not that good, but some of the released singles are the only good songs on there which are great songs to listen to and dance to. But I highly recommend that you get Christina Aguilera because she is very good with different vocals and looks awesome. I think that she is better then other female pop artist though she reaches two different genres. It is a great choice for those who are also buying Billie's ""Honey To The B""."
4,She is ok . not the best,"I just bought this CD totay And its OK.Some of the songs are kind of sick like ""Love Groove"" And some of the songs are pretty good like ""Honey To The Bee"",""I Dream"" And ""Because We Want To"" But if your not alloud to listen to swear words dont buy it! As I said before its not bad but its not the best CD in the World.{Britney Spears is better so if you dont have her CD GET IT!!!!!!!"
4,Decent CD,"Yes, some call her the British Brittany Spears, but I think that's just wrong. While the entire CD is relatively bland, she does have a great voice and good lyrics. The problem is that nothing just reaches up and grabs me. She's hot as hell though and who wouldn't root for Rose!"
3,Because She Wants To,"Why did she do it? Because she wanted to, that's why. Billie (who dropped her surname Piper for her debut release) was a big teen pop starlet over in the UK for a little bit, releasing four dynamic singles - ""Because We Want To"", ""Girlfriend"", ""She Wants You"", and ""Honey To The Bee"". Her singles are generally her strongest tracks, but the album does have some good pop tunes nestled in the nooks and crannies. The best of these hidden gems is ""Officially Yours"". The rest are the tracks are fun and enjoyable, but not as strong as the stuff of her second album ""Walk Of Life"". Good fun pop stuff."
3,"ok, i'll admit it","ok its not that bad, i just always thought she was a copy of britney an didn't take time to really notice. But she is that bad, her voice is ok, and some of her songs are ok, but others make no sense what so ever. I wouldn't suggest it to people that don't like pop. Maybe if i liked pop i would've liked it more."
5,The best ever album,"Billie is music world material, she has made some extremely great songs like 'Party On The Phone' 'Because We Want To' and my favourite 'Honey To The Bee'. Whoever thinks she's 'trash' you must be defending Britney because Billie is cool! You go BILLIE girl, go straight to the top of the charts! Please note that I have Britney's and Billie's album and Britney's seems to be gathering dust because I listen to Billie's only!"
4,A Committment to the Small-Church Pastor,"Steve Bierly does an excellent and proficient job of expressing the very unique and strategic struggles that the Small-Church Pastor encounters.Bierly uses a wealth of experience and illustrations any Small-Church Pastor (or anyone associated with Ministry) would instantely recall as a ""me too"" experience.Because of the subject matter, there is a great deal of emotion that happens between the writer, the Spirit of God and the reader.Ultimately, the book accomplishes a chief objective as A Guide to Spiritual and Emotional Well-Being [for the Small-Church Pastor].I've already ordered [from Amazon] and had a copy of this book shipped to another Pastor friend of mine."
4,Big or Small...a good book for any pastor,"This is a good book for any pastor of any size church. It is not a hard read nor a deep theological read. Rather, it is an easy and enjoyable read. It makes real the hardship of being a pastor while pointing towards the real reasons one should be in such a role."
4,Bolle Sunglasses,Excelente los lentes son bellísimos livianos y no la imagen es nítida no te cansa la vista. El envío fue rapidísimo y sin inconvenientes.Recomiendo la tienda y el artículo.
5,truly God breathed,This cd is truly God breathed. the most spiritually uplifting music i have ever heard
5,"Powerful, heart felt praise","This is one of Steve Camp's finest works. I found this albumn particularly moving. He sings with power and emotion, and I am truly blessed each time I play it. God less you, Steve!"
5,Love's labour lost in the Wraeththu world,"In a remote corner of the Wraeththu world, far from the splendid Immanion and the grim Fulminir, a late-incepted har in the country of Alba Sulh comes to the peaceful village of Jesith to be trained by the renowned local Hienama (wraeththu High Priest), Ysobi. From here develops a tale of love (and lovemaking), difficult relationships, misundertandings and disappointements between the hara of Jesith, precipitated by the arrival of a problematical student for Ysobi.A tale of love and thorns, friendships and affections strained and conflicting, a very good piece from Storm Constantine, this time very graphic in describing Wraeththu lovemaking, Aruna. A little, hot masterpiece"
5,wow,"This is the first real recording with David Phelps on tenor, if you don't count the Christmas CD. This very well may be the greatest recording ever done by any artist ever. Even the weak songs are pretty good, but there are about 9 or 10 you will listen to a 1000 times."
5,A Must For Any Gospel Music Lover!!,"I am a fan of various styles of gospel quartet music. The Catherdrals, Gold City, 4-Him, the list goes on. The Vocal Band has risen to the pinnacle in my opinion. This CD is jam packed full of uplifting songs. Child You're Forgiven brings to mind God's salvation and is my favorite song. The rendition of the Star Spangled Banner had me wanting to stand up in my car--while driving. Every song is awesome, this is one CD you won't regret purchasing."
5,Howard Roberts,"There are few artists that can match the style of Howard Roberts. Johnny Smith, Barney Kessel are a couple. It took me quite awhile to locate Howard Roberts information and his CDs. I was saddened to find that he passed away. That is a great loss to guitar aficionados. I am happy that I now have six Howard Roberts albums. one is vinyl from the 50s. If you love jazz guitar this is a best bet bargin that will please you. The quality and timely delivery from Amazon.com was very satisfying."
3,Ordered by Amazon spec but still the wrong size,I ordered this based on the truck make/model/year and it was still the wrong size. The only reason I'm giving this a 3-star rating is because Amazon accepted the return and credited our account so quickly. Recommend going into a truck/car accessory store WITH YOUR VEHICLE if you want to get a dashmat cover.
4,Criminal Behavior : A Psychosocial Approach (7th Edition,"This has been an extremely helpful book for criminal justice majors and psychology majors alike. I would reccomend this as a do not sell at the end of the semester, it is one to keep."
3,incomplete show,"This dvd is not as descibed on the back. It's supposed to be an hour long and the running time is 45 mins. The reason for that is the last segment, the Madrid restaurant visit, is missing, which I found very disappointing."
1,Beautiful and ....,"Very shiny and durable not the best cut or clarity but a great bargin. Make sure to clean bracelet when it arrives or wrist may break out from polish, if you have sensitive skin. My girl friend loves it for everyday wear."
2,explaining diseases and causes but luck alternative heath in,"this book explains wonderfuly all the digestive problems and a their causes,followed by a general information guidence in nutrition but only in the terms of not doing anymore agravation. this book is very much luck the information of nutritional supplements and their role in healing=wich make this book a very narrow view point of how to treat the gastro intestinal tract diseases"
4,The Dark Chamber - A Gothic Tale of Ambition and Ruin,"Cline's Dark Chamber is a tale of a man, half Gothic hero, half Byronic villain, who has opted to defy Nature herself, as well as the natural order of things, by artificially coaxing his memories to the fore in an attempt to avoid facing the reality of his current, shattered reality. In an ill-fated quest to recapture the glories of his youth, he not only revisits his personal memories but accidentally unlocks those primordial memories of man's collective subconscious from a time when the division between man and beast was even more tenuous than exists today.The Dark Chamber is a sinister, malevolent journey back to our dubious hereditary history and a warning that the past and the present are often poor bedfellows."
4,"Truth, Honor, Love",In days of old when knights were bold...this novel brings Crusaders to life. Was their goal a kingdom of heaven on Earth? Who are the descendants of Jesus? Why does the woman who discovers this secret information become a target? Can she find the inner strength to survive? This book celebrates the everlasting qualities of love!!
1,I agree--don't be fooled--NOT a quality book.,"The inappropriate, and unnecessary, foul language and romping sexual adventures detract from what might have been an interesting topic and an interesting writing style (similar to Nevil Shute's in 'An Old Captivity,' 'The Rainbow and the Rose,' and 'In the Wet.') The book is bothersome to read, what with its short, choppy, 4th-grade reading level sentence structures and its endless 'songs.' If you are truly interested in the ideas posited in this book, I would suggest Gardner's 'Bloodline of the Holy Grail.' It is a quite good read, is based on much research, and is a class act compared to this poorly-proofread (especially with to/too, + pg 50 and pg 120) novel."
1,Defenders of the Holy Grail,"Interesting premise, but very poorly written. The book reads more like an outline than a completed work. It has no drama or passion. Too bad, since this is an extremely important subject. This century will see the emergence of Mary Magdalene as a key religious and historical figure."
1,"An interesting premise, but...","This is a poorly written book. The language is juvenile, the thoughts incomplete. I did not get a feel for the characters. I certainly didn't get any sense of ""love and light"". After reading some of the other reviews I thought it might be worth a try, however I found it disappointing to say the least. I'm glad Amazon has a return policy."
2,Sappy and uneven,"After reading the other reviews I was all set for an interesting read. Sadly I was disappointed. The writer could have used a good editor to even out the plot and cause less confusion between stream of conscious writing and parallel plot. As this subject has been examined ad infinitum, there was nothing fresh in the concept, the characters with the exception of Elise were all pretty flat. The cover offered great promise, but sadly the book didn't deliver."
3,Not up to Greene's standards.,"Maria Greene is back with the second book in her highwayman trilogy. When Nicholas Thurston and his friend Rafe hold up the carriage, they don't expect to take a hostage, but that's exactly what they do. A blunderbuss-bearing young beauty tries to defend herself and pulls off Nicholas' mask. Because she has seen his face, he can't let her go free. He holds her hostage, first in a cottage, then in his house in London. Serena is running from her murderous uncle when her flight is interrupted by her abduction. Her life is ruled by fear, and she is the only witness to her father's murder by her uncle. She grows to love Nicholas, even though she can't get past his criminal activities, which she knows are committed to raise money for an orphanage. This novel is engrossing, but not up to the standard set by the first book in the trilogy (A Bandit's Kiss)."
1,Horrible show,"I attended the show this book is based on at the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston and was extremely disappointed. The photographs selected for the show were without merit and neither my friend nor I were able ascertain what the show purported to illustrate, which is the relationship between commercial fashion work and personal artistic expression. I suggest passing this one by, its not worth it."
2,Low quality t-shirt,"The image is great! But the shirt itself is really thin and poor quality. Really glad I went a size bigger because it looks small (who knows what it will be like after it is washed).I scowered the internet for a Press Your Luck shirt and found this same one on many sites. I guess it's the only one out there. So, if you are looking for something like this, you may as well go for it.Poor quality for the hefty price though."
2,Not totally convinced,"I can appreciate the ideas behind the book, to a point. I commend Ms. Kole's great faith and success at overcoming an eating disorder; however, eating disorders are severe addictions and extremely powerful psychological illnesses--for many, there is no other way to look at an eating disorder, no shift of thought, that will ""cure"" us. While this approach may work for non-eating disordered people, or even for some with eating disorders, I know that there are also many who will end up dead before they can convince themselves out of their disease."
5,A reality that unsettles fundamentalists and islamophobes alike.,Don't expect any conservatives to welcome any kind of a progressive.I find it interesting that the only two groups panning Mr. Safi's text are dogmatic 'Muslim' conservatives unnerved at the thought of any kind of Islamic Renaissance and right-wing Orientalist neocon and/or neocon sympathizers squirming and jerking for any way they might rationalize their Islamophobia. Both right-wing groups have and will continue to fail and cast darkness on the Islamic world.It seems to me that Mr. Safi certainly hit the mark he was aiming for. Here's to a future of hope! Insha-Allah. =)
1,BOOOOORING!!!!,"From page 1, I found this to be the most boring book I have ever read. I suffered through 100 pages, and by that time I was ready to jab a letter opener in my eyes, so I put the book in the trash. Thank God I only paid $1 for it at a library book sale. I would have been sorely disappointed if I had paid full price."
3,Not his best book but....,"worth the effort for the intelligent writing, a trait that we have come to expect from Hollinghurst following his two earlier, brilliant works. I marvelled at many wonderful passages in the book, the sharp depiction of gay mores and the yearning and disappointment in relationships that is, for me at least, a Hollinghurst hallmark. Perhaps these same literary qualities overwhelm, to some extent, what is essentially a simple tale that could have benefited from tighter editing. There are several scenes and characters in the book that do not seem to add much to the content and context of the story, hence rendering it less engaging than it could have been."
2,I must have dosed off....,"Sorry boys, but i thought this one was quite boring. I've read 2 others by Hollinghurst and found them good reads, so was disappointed in this novel. Too contrived, nothing to propel the story and just found it to be an OK read..."
2,Ironically undersexed,"Hollinghurst's character development is attrocious to a point where nothing is out of character for anyone. While he brings together four potentially strong characters (the nice guy, the young tease, the oddly aloof and the aging circumspect lover), he leaves an unseemly amount of room for expansion on both the characters, their interactions, their foibles and a multitude of themes. He deals sparingly with class distinction, its role in gay society and differences in city versus country life (by making the country-dwelling main characters oblivious of the staid nature of the tired hamlet). Oddly, he writes powerfully of the ""nice guy's"" first experiment with Ecstasy, intertwining it poignantly his relationship with the ""young tease,"" though overall the book does little to challenge or promote thought. The Spell is little more than a mildly believable portrayal of gay life, a diversion that should be recognized as such."
4,"Embarrassingly honest, emotionally trying","Hollinghurst's characters at first seem to be cut from the cloth of your standard gay caricatures of the day -- aging boy toys, emotionally unavailable clubkids, remote primadonnas, etc. But Alan layers them well, painting reactions to common, yet trying situations with care and candor. By placing the characters in these situations, he challenged my preconceptions of them, and at times had me reconsdering my knee-jerk judgements of the four men involved in a dizzy summer of love...."
3,Wished I could care more about the characters,"The writing is excellent and I would read his novel no matter what, but I just couldn't get into the characters. Wished Alan spent as much time on his character development as on his writing style."
5,The Spell,Its all about the nature of love? - what a strange spell that is. About friendship.The poetry in it is great. The characters enjoyable. Like Jane Austen in that it all happens within our daily domestic life.
2,"What You Expect , What You Get","The LC make loud, plain, by the numbers punk. Nothing special here, in fact it all sounds the same. I found my self adding `blah blah blah' to each track. Can rebellion really be so boring and predictable? The word poseur comes to mind. Also, the album is TOO DARN LONG."
3,Nice Gift Says it All,"If you hate trying to look for a card that is different then the usual norm, this type of gift card that will work just fine."
5,Most important piece of reading I have done concerning my career!,"If you are an INFP, on the Myers Briggs personality preference inventory, I hope you read this book. I found much of myself in this book and was able to fill in the missing pieces to many of the reasons that I am not satisfied with my career. I have started on a new career path of my own. Thanks to this book I have more understanding and courage to make a change in my life at 42 years old."
5,Hidden Treasure,"The book The Money is the Gravy is truly a hidden treasure. It inspires me with a vision of how work can be fulfilling when it is aligned with our core values, our strengths and our passions. Our work is enjoyable when our motivation comes from these inner sources. We don't dread getting up in the morning to go to work for another day of drudgery because the nature of the work is ill-fitted to our values and vision. The writer himself lives what he preaches because he is a former lawyer who has now found just the right mix of work to bring him satisfaction. As a life coach, I recommend this book as it offers plenty of food for thought for those who are searching for career direction or life direction. A very well written piece that should receive high acclaim."
4,Great gift for a teen,"This book got my kid excited about cooking again! I ask her to cook one dinner a night, but she tended to fall back on packaged foods. This cookbook has inspired her, and every recipe she has tried has been good. There are a number of recipes for one person, but our child is rarely home alone in the evenings so she doubles or triples the ingredients for a family dinner. Her favorite so far - egg salad tortilla wraps."
3,Teen Cooking,"This book is OK but ""Cooking Up a Storm: The Teen Survival Cookbook"" is a much better book for teens. A good addition if you want more than one cook book for kids."
1,Dont buy,Dont buy this book! I purchased this book liking some of the recipes but I soon realized what a mistake it was. Not only dose the book barely go into detail about what you'll need for each recipe but most of the recipes in the book you can make yourself. You dont need a recipe to tell you how to make nachos.
5,Teens Cook--Beyond the Microwave,My daughter received this book and we both love it. The entree recipes provide clear directions and come with side-dish suggestions and general cooking tips. Any teen who wants to move cooking skills beyond the microwave should own this book and the partner bookTeens Cook Dessert. The recipes in both are delish!
5,Hopefully this works,This is for a niece who does not cook at all and is a picky eater. The cook book featured several dishes that I know she loves and I think it will inspire her to try to do some meals on her own.
5,Teen will cook!,My 13 year old LOVES the graphics and the variety of recipes. Some wholesome and healthy foods and some decadent and funky fun foods. My Girl Scout Troop selected this book out of a stack to use for cooking meals for a whole weekend!
2,Don't expect Eddy to be Eddy,"This could be worth a final chapter to your Eddy Arnold collection.However, don't expect the Eddy Arnold of almost90 to be the one we have memories of.Maybe two cuts are good...the rest find Eddy unable tohit the low...and some high notes."
1,Falls short of expectations,"The text appears to be overly simplistic in its prose and analysis. After reading it, the author's credibility as an authoritative source on Warren Buffett's methods becomes questionable.If one wants to better ""allocate one's capital,"" more authoritative and analytical sources are available in the marketplace, such as Buffettology, which was written a TRUE Buffett who saw firsthand the master at work."
5,The best Buffett book on the market,"Although there have been other books claiming to reveal the methods that have made Warren Buffett a billionaire this is the first wholly practical and accurate guide. Simmons first takes the reader through the analytical and qualitative techniques using a progressively convincing sequence of arguments. The second half is a series of case studies showing exactly what information Buffett had and what calculations he made when he made his celebrated investments e.g. Coca-Cola and Gillette.Basically this is an excellent practical guide to investing that could make you, too, a billionaire."
2,required for class,"i found this book very hard to understand. it uses quite a bit of jargon and chapters referance other movies as if your sure to know them and i don't. if you have a deep cinema background you would likely not notice these things, they may even add to it. this was my first class on cinema though and i didnt get it. not for laymen."
2,Very basic; disappointing,"Based on the reviews on the cover of this book, and the reviews of others, I bought it expecting something new and original. Boy was I disappointed. Indeed, in the preface the author owns up: ""I should confess that, in writing this book, I have done little original research. I have borrowed most of my examples from works by other analysts, mostly social scientists and journalists."" Boy howdy, did he ever ""borrow"" them. So don't look here for anything new. I suspect this was just a quickly dashed together ""sequel"" to his first book, which I haven't read. So my advice is to skip this one."
5,Beautiful!,"I love my cover. I actually have mine in pink. I thought it would be like the freebie one that came with the reader, but in actuality, it was much better! It has suede leather on the inside to protect the screen and the back has a card window, a little pocket to hold your extra cartridge, and then a larger pocket as well.It's beautiful! I love it! I want a red one too!"
1,Beware of the size chart!,"How can I rate this pair of boots as good if the size chart on Amazon that I used to purchase it is so ""off"" that I can't get my feet in the things and it will cost me money to make an exchange?I wear 10D shoes, and have for decades, and have purchased other boots in 10D size, and have had no problems. However, this pair is at least 1 1/2 to 2 full sizes too small; I can't even get my heel half way into the boot. So now I have to pay about $5.00 to return them, then wait for a refund.I even checked with a ""boot expert"" to see if I should have known better than to order a pair using my shoe size, but he said it wasn't my fault.Not sure whose fault is that these won't fit at all because of an inaccurate size chart, but it sure isn't mine, and I resent having to pay for the experience."
3,Boots run small!,Liked the boots but thy run small and had to return them ... Free returns but the discount offer had expired so not sure Ill try a different size for 20 percent more...hmmmm
5,Boot Scootin',"These boots are handsome, well made and just right for wearing in the winter. They have distressed leather uppers and have rubberized soles. They are a tight fit with thick socks, but with thin socks they go right on. They look great on my husband, the cowboy in the family."
5,nice!,These boots are just what I wanted.They fit well out of the box and look great.I will order these again.
5,Great Deal!,The Lock Cylinder worked perfectly & the quality was excellent. It came with 2 VW type keys & you will find it hard to tell it's not the original. It does not come with instructions so be prepared to look up the remove/install procedure in your shop manual or the internet.It arrived at my door 2 days after ordering! Now that's fast!
2,unstable,"good idea but unless you have a center stand on your bike, when you roll the tire on the stand the bike will move to either side and might fall off"
2,The Body on the Beach was not worth the read,"The Body on the BeachThis book just rambled on and on. Characters were boring, and confusing as one never knew who was whom and from whose viewpoint the story was changing to/from. Utterly boring."
4,Another winner for Simon Brett,I was hoping for another Charles Paris story however I started reading and realized that Carol and Jude are as interesting as old Charles. I can't wait to find out more about this pair.Mr. Brett's strength lies in his ability to make his characters human and interesting; his plots believable. You want them to be safe and happy.
5,RGM,"Next American Essay will really make you think about the genre-What is the essay? How do we define it and why? What are our expectations and do they matter?If you are looking for a traditional anthology this book is not for you, but if you are interested in exploring the possibilities of the essay, this book is a find! Next American Essay offers the reader a lot, but most of it is not on the surface. This is not an anthology that is easy to skim through, but it's definitely worth a serious read."
4,Foolish reviewers...,"...make me laugh. This is the best anthology of essays that anyone's even tried to produce in the past two decades. On top of that it's one of the most inovative anthologies of any genre category that I know of. What's missing is something of David Foster Wallace's more wilder side. Needs something from Ben Marcus, Harry Matthews, Joanne Beard, Susan Howe, and Lynn Hejinian."
1,Night Claws,I own tons of Bigfoot dvds. This is among the worst. The trailer for another movie at the beginning was as offensive as offensive gets and it had nothing to do with bigfoot; just violence towards women. The plot was dumb. The effects were dumb. The acting was dumb. The ending was dumb. Get the picture?
4,Furry & Scary Effort to Re-Ignite Our Love of Classic Scares !,"Stars: Reb Brown, Sherrie Rose, Frank Stallone and Leilani Sarelle.This David Prior - directed effort is really good monster flick,There was a prior thought to go straight to television or edited with an eye for commercial insertion ?The old tv adage about `Showing The Bear Early...' or however it went,May apply here,The creative side OR producers want you to see WHAT FRIGHTENS you and then cut to results of mayhem.Besides DAVID PRIOR making a director's comeback,He has REB BROWN acting like the kind of sherriff we fondly recall,SHERRY ROSE being the Lois Lane-ish pal and FRANK STALLONE as a classic heavy.The monster is almost as brutal as a human monster,DAVID CAMPBELL,Who has alot of screen time and deserves it.TED PRIOR is a consummate actor,Not seen much since late '90s and has a good guy bent, Except this go round.LEILANI SARELLE has a story arch,That's right there is a story to this monster hunt from Midnight Releasing."
5,Awakening,This movie was ordered at the same time as another movie I got. It took longer than expected but well worth the wait.
2,Heater is loud,This is a loud heater thats does cut off periodically when it gets too hot; although I am still cold. It also blew the curcuit. I would not recommend purchasing and I will probably send it back.
5,very nice,This little heater is very nice and has a nice range of heat we love that it swivels also. No assembly yeah.
2,Doesn't Whistle,"for some reason i also need it to be known that this kettle does not whistle.I thought it was missing some part to cover the spout so the steam escapes from the lid whistle...it does not. Cuisinart says it's just the kettle, nothing else comes with it.I gave it a 2 because it looks nice. otherwise it would have been 1.and while waiting for it to whistle, the handle became very hot."
3,No whistle,"I purposely bought this because I wanted a kettle with a whistle -- and preferred the classic style of this model. It does look very nice, but it does not whistle. I boiled water 4 times, and nothing. Following other people's advice to let it come to a full boil and allow steam to really build up did not work either -- It actually got to the point the kettle was shaking from the boiling water and steam was coming out the whistle slits and still no sound.I rated it three stars because it does look nice otherwise, but not what I was looking for. It's going back."
3,"Elegant Design and Construction, but takes too long to heat water","We went from a nice kettle to an even nicer one, but this one takes 25% longer to heat the water, and life is too short for that."
1,handle so hot I needed an oven mitt to pour!,"Bought this kettle for my mom (an Irish tea-drinker) to replace an older Farberware one that is flaking inside. Though the shape is lovely and the whistle intriguing, the fact that the handle got so hot I had to use an over mitt to pour means this kettle is going back to Amazon tomorrow. The handle was too hot to handle which makes this kettle a fail for our family."
2,Doesn't Whistle,"After using this kettle (almost daily) for a good 6 months it has ""whistled"" about 3 or 4 times. And the whistle is more of a hum or buzz which doesn't carry very well. When pouring hot water it can spit out of the lid/whistle holes. Not happy with it. It's fine if you're hanging around the kitchen but when relying on the whistle to alert you when it's ready, forget it."
3,rigid handle,love the tea kettle; very clean lines and great looking.BUT the handle is rigid making it difficult to put water into the pot.
1,Dangerous,"We have used this kettle about 5 times. It has whistled only 1 time. This can be very dangerous as it can boil dry without you knowing it. So if you use this kettle, keep an eye on it. Don't depend on it to whistle."
4,Attractive and functional,I've had this kettle for 6 months now and really like it. It hasn't rusted or even blemished the stainless. People complain that it doesn't whistle. Well first off it's not a whistle but a 2 note harmonica. To make it work you have to fill the water full enough to cover the hole to the spout or the steam will just blow out that hole. They must have updated this model because mine doesn't have an encapsulated aluminum disc. My only complaint is the handle can get hot. Otherwise I'd give it 5 stars.
1,Not as advertised,"I purchased this item to replace one i had returned to cuisinart under warranty. The cuisinart website said that this pot had a copper sandwich bottom which my old pot had. This pot either doesn't have that bottom or it's so thin you can't see it.Since then my original unit has been replaced with one of ""like kind and quality"" by cuisinart and it also has no copper bottom.i should have purchased a kitchenaid.One good thing in this whole experience is that cuisinart has had and still does have great customer service(just lower quality products then they used to have)"
2,No Whistle Here!,It is a very nice looking teapot. But is does not whistle. I wish it did. I always forget that it is on.
4,Works for me,"Good product, holds plenty of water. Whistle works fine. Whistle works on pressure so there has to be enough water to stop steam from coming out of the spout. Do you really need a whistle to know when water is boiling?"
5,the great surprise,"the cuisinart 2- Qt. whistling kettle I purchased had a surprise in store for me. I'd spent many hours on the internet looking for a replacement for my tea kettle that had wounderful style and sounded like a harmonica when it whistled. The cuisinart had the style but no harmonica whistle (or so I thought). The first time the kettle whistled, it was just like my old favorite, a harmonica! what a delight! Please let shopper's know this as nothing was said about the ""whistler"" other than it had one."
2,Returned,"I recieved an electric tea kettle as a gift and liked it better because it boiled water faster than the stove top Cuisinart. Other than that, there was nothing wrong with the Cuisinart Kettle."
4,Cuisinart BA-170 Classic 2-Quart Whistling Kettle,It looks great works great but if you try to do a small amount of water the whistle doesn't work.
1,Thumbs Down,I had to toss the tea pot. I found myself fighting with the lid when trying to remove it from the pot. I'm a lover not a fighter. Goodbue tea pot.
5,Ressurection,"This book is stunning. It helped me understand how my wives devoured me. It gave me a way to understand screwed up relationships -- with everyone -- including corporate vampires, sucking the soul out of our society.You HAVE to read this book."
5,Definately read this book!,"This is simply the best book on the reality of TRUE vampires probably ever written! They're so numerous, that the odds are good that YOU are being fed on right now, and don't even know it! Read it and then recoil in horror when the recognition set in of all the vampires you have in your vicinity, and how they may have infected YOU with the subconscious tendency to prey on others also. Knowledge is definitely power with this one, for only when you KNOW something, can you free yourself from it. This is one of those rare books that EVERYONE should read."
1,Hungerin' for Jungian?,"If you're into Jungian analysis, this book is for you!But for most people, ""The Sociopath Next Door"" will be a much better choice."
1,False Information,All of the information in this book about vampyres is false. Barely .11%is true. And that is only the fast that this is a book. You should not write books about something your dont know anything about. Your book should be discontinued!
4,Good Luck,"This cornicello was a gift for my husband to block the ""evil eye"" when he plays poker. He likes wearing it. It's a fun piece, arrives as described online."
2,junk!,"This persons work sucks. There is black paint on the charm, and after a week it started chipping off. And this whole month everything seems to go wrong. This is no luck charm, maybe an unlucky charm."
4,"Lotsa gravy, little meat but a tasty meal!","I found this story an amusing diversion from my usual diet of futuristic nanotech hard sci fi.There's not much plot to support the single excellent premise of a company reaching back in time and creating immortal operatives who then live into the future preserving cultures and artifacts as they go. This book is more like a few long stories linked by that idea.I was bothered at first by the lack of meat, but by the end of the book I'd let myself settle for a big helping of between meal sweets.I would have loved to have a few of the obvious loose ends properly explained or wrapped up. Perhaps Baker will do so in a later book.All in all, a pleasant diversion, light and enjoyable."
3,Intriguing ideas make for an enjoyable read,"Sky Coyote continues the story of Joseph and Mendoza, immortal Company agents who travel through history by living it. This book is similar to her others in that it is a strange mix of fascinating ideas and uneven storytelling. I enjoy the characters and concepts, am intrigued by the overarching plot about the ultimate goals of the company, but Baker definately has problems with pacing and plot structure.Some events which could be given much more attention are blown off with a few words, others (like the huge chapter describing a festival play -- not quite as bad as the interminable scene-by-scene descriptions of movies in ""Mendoza in Hollywood"") go into painfully dull detail for long periods of time. Main problem with this installment: Nothing really HAPPENS!However, it's a quick read, has some great funny scenes (the whole Roadrunner/Coyote scene made the novel worth it!), and a really interesting premise... that's what keeps me coming back."
2,"Lots of tease, not much action","When I was about 40 pages from the end of this book, I suddenly realized that nothing much had yet happened and that no real plot had been set up--a few minor incidents were set up and resolved, yes, but IMO they fell flat. There are some unsubtle teasers for plot developments in future books, but they only emphasize how little actually happens in this installment. I loved ""In the Garden of Iden,"" which is probably the best time-travel morality play since Connie Willis's ""Doomsday Book,"" but I found ""Sky Coyote"" completely unsatisfying. I'm not planning on reading the next book in the series, ""Mendoza in Hollywood,"" until it comes out in paperback; if it's as much of a letdown as ""Sky Coyote,"" I won't bother with any further books in the series."
3,Judging a book by its cover,"Looking at the cover art, you would get a much different idea of what the book might be about than if you read the short summary on the back. Luckily I read the summary and realized it was a story I would be interested in.The plot idea is appealing to me, and I think I would have been much more satisfied with it had I read more of this series than just this one book; in this book, you get a snippet of the overall plot - what is happening in basically one mission in the past, rather than a more in depth understanding of the Company as a whole. Perhaps this is done in another book in the series, or perhaps the macro plot is just a construct to allow infinite possibilities of sequels, each looking at a mission in the past.Regardless, the author's humor is often witty, and the book was enjoyable on it's own, though I don't plan to read any of the other books."
5,Coyote in the sky,"This book is more satyrical that it's apparent, and some have misunderstood it. All hepisodes are viewed through Joseph's/Coyote disenchanted eyes, the SPA of the immortals, the all-too modern-thinking Humashup ( with their quarrelling pompous priests), the fundamentalists Chinigchinix (whose monotheism is a bit exaggerated in the novel), the prissiy, squeamish health-freaks of the future. A satire of humanity's flawed ways of coming to terms with themseklves and rthe world, and a clever reflection on religion and the unfortunate effects of enforcing one's revelation to others. And bebneath Joseph/Coyote's cynicism you can feel an heart of compassion and empathy, for humanity and for grief-striken Mendoza, which we shall encounter again in Hollywood. We feel this book prophetic, as another Goat-Cult menaces today's humanity."
1,Disappointed,"While I thought the first book in this series, In the Garden of Iden, was an interesting take on time travel, Sky Coyote did not live up to my expectations. Mendoza's voice was the one heard in Garden, and Joseph's in Coyote; but I found no difference between them and had a difficult time adjusting to Joseph's narration. I find it hard to believe a 20,000 year old man and the Neanderthal ""giggle,"" although this verb appears several times in relation to their dialogue. Perhaps Baker has a more difficult time getting into the head of a male protagonist, but I never believed Joseph was speaking. I do not wish to offend anyone, but I also thought that after the first few pages, the description of Chumash ceremonies was gratuitous and did not move the plot forward."
5,This is a good book!!!!,"This is an excellent book. Speaking as an American Indian, I want to thank Kage Baker for writing a book in which the Indians are neither noble savages nor stupid primitives, but shown as intelligent human beings with individual personalities - some good, some not so good, just like any other real people. Thanks too for showing that ""primitive"" Indians before the white arrival had sophisticated cultures and complex economies, not just hunting and fishing. And this is the only white author I have ever read who brings out the Indian's sense of humor.There is more to this book than just the Indian stuff (there is some very good satire on white bureaucrats) but that is what I know the most about. On that basis I say this is a good book and you should read it."
3,2nd Act in a 3 Act Play,"I loved In the Garden of Iden -- It consumed me (I would give it 5 stars). I enjoyed Sky Coyote, but it left me unsatisfied. I pondered the issue for a while, until I figured out the problem: Sky Coyote is the 2nd Act in a 3 Act Play. It takes the characters from the first act, puts them into a new and difficult situation, and then leaves them there -- to be rescued in the third act. Viewed from that perspective, Sky Coyote was great -- it nicely set up the next book that Baker is writing (actually, she has already written it and is working on book #7!!!). I am now eagerly anticipating the next installment. On its own merits, it lacked the engrossing excitement of the first book, but as a precursor of things to come, it was tantalizing, interesting and definately worth the time and money to read."
1,Who is that ?,"Did they take any time too look at Ron Artest ? This figure is awful ! everything is ugly about it ! The box is big, the colors are ugly. And Ron Artest looks like some random black guy with a kings jersey on. Plus Artest LOOKS CROSS EYED! And Look at the stupid pose they put him in as well... ""Please someone pass me the ball "" he is saying.If I wasn't a die hard Kings fan, this ugly figure wouldn't be on my wall. Mcfarlane didn't a awful job on this one. Awfully funny though."
5,Interesting but a little dry.,"As a weaver, I had often heard that the Jacquard loom with its punch card mechanism was the precursor of computers. This is not a universally accepted point of view. This books sets out to trace the invention of the Jacquard through to data processing and therefor to computing.It is well written and I am plugging through it. Not a ""page Turner"" but still very interesting."
5,The Best Intro to MFC out there.,"I have a few books on MFC and windows programming in general, with one thing in common - they were collecting dust on my shelf, because none of them covered the fundamentals good, they would all go right into wizards, or spend forever on semantics, without really teaching you why. I'm an embedded engineer, with good c background, and some experience with c++, and this book IS THE BEST. After spending less than 1 hour on first few chapters, I felt like I was finally getting it, and right now, more advanced reading like Blaszczak's MFC finally makes sense. I am also surprised by negative reviews here - in my opinion this book is THE book to get started with windows programming, and really know what you are doing."
3,Buy Programming windows with mfc,"I've used this book and the prosise book ""Programming windows with mfc"" second edition. The ""from the ground up"" book seems to be a summary of the prosise book, missing some information. Most of the samples in the ""from the ground up book"" are exactly the same, only not as good of documentation for them, like the prosise book. The prosise book also has some difficult to find stuff that you just won't find in the ""from the ground up"". I wish I hadn't bought the ""from the ground up"", because anytime I have a question, I go to the prosise book."
4,"Good, but...","I pretty much agree with most of the comments below. This book is straightforward, and a good introduction to MFC. It's not a Prosise book, but it does cover the fundamentals, which are all a beginner needs anyway. The book does contain numerous errata, however. (For example, the word ""hierarchy"" is misspelled in the captions on both pages 18 and 19. And that's just the beginning.) Overall, however, these don't detract significantly from the book's content.I would recommend this book to anybody who doesn't know a thing about MFC and would like to learn the basics. Just don't try to contact the author, though, who seems like a real jerk. I e-mailed him twice asking him if he would like a list of errata--even through an e-mail address that I got from the publisher--and he flat out never responded. Other authors seem grateful for such feedback, but not this guy. Anyway, even though the author seems to be someone you would never want to meet, this book is still a pretty good buy."
2,Applicable to MFC v2 not MFC v6.,I bought this book to learn MFC version 6 which the book claims to cover. The examples do not use any of Visual c++ wizards and I was constantly battling to try to get Visual c++ to accept the example code. Additionally it is only when you get to chapter 17 that the author reveals that all the examples in the book have been written for MFC version 2 and chapter 17 gives a brief overview of version 6 and the class wizards. I gave up on the book at chapter 5 and have made good progress using only the help and examples found on the Internet. I think your money would be better spent on a more current book.
3,Stay away from this series,"The biggest problem with this book is that it's ugly. No, not just ugly, but the typeface chosen is too large and very difficult to read. It doesn't matter that the material is good if I can't stand to read the book. What's hard about reading it? The type is too large and heavy, and you can't quickly scan the pages, you have to read letter by letter to make the words."
4,Great Reference Book,"The book is great as a reference guide, but the quality of the book was in rough shape. You get what you pay for though."
4,NICE WATCH,"I bought the watch for my daughter, she loved it. It came in a box with a price that was $10.00 less than I paid for it."
3,DON'T DROP IT!,"This may be a good or great saw, but I didn't get to use it long enough to find out. I dropped it on hard dirt and the top handle burst like I dropped it on concrete and when I tried repairing it with locktite super glue it would not hold.I will fix it. I am not a novice with saws of any type. I puchased this one because of the price and amps. I own 2 other Circular saws, 1 maybe 12 years old, jig saws, sawsall and etc., but I have never had a new saw break like this one did in much harder drops. Just bad luck or a bad materials for the casing, I don't know."
3,Standard circular saw,"This is very much standard circular saw. No dust collection, and bulky. I should have bought Porter-Cable 325MAG with dust collection. Damn!"
5,I rather get Moe Doe,"overall this album iz tyte. the worst thing bout tha album iz dat dere arent enuff trackz 2 satisfy, but the ones da hav are good enuff. The well known song off da album iz ""it's gettin hot"" which iz a big ass club banger. the track ""Rather Gt Moe Doe"" ft. keak da sneak slapz yadamean. iz gotta b da best song on da cd. another good track iz ""I'm on one"". da cd iz juss good. cop it."
2,Not really helpful.,"There was not very much to really learn from this. It is okay to learn basics like colors, numbers, food, and whatnot. Basically equivalent to a high school course. Not really useful as far as learning the language though. It's cheap enough though if you want to start to get to learn the language."
5,Hard to find this 1 of a kind,"This product was packaged well and arrived quickly.I came across this cologne about 25 years ago, back when I was in Junior High. The smell is just intoxicating and unforgettable. Somehow, this cologne just disappeared off of the shelves. So, I am real ecstatic to have found it on Amazon.I purchased 1 bottle for my Husband as a Christmas gift. He wears cologne for me on special occasions or when we are out painting the town red. I know that he will enjoy wearing this cologne because I will be smelling him ever so closely all night long. In all honesty this cologne is such a turn-on, along with the man that is using it."
2,"Graet for the price , but ..............","This is a bargain for die-hard fans of Nuclear Asssault. If you are just getting into this band I recommend earlier recordings like ""GAME OVER "" and "" SURVIVE ""."
1,WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY!,"Do not bother. This is the definitely a poor excuse of a kickboxing video. No talking, no motivational cues. It is apparent the music is dubbed in after he does the video. It is distracting to do the moves listening to the poor quality music. The warmup is a joke, and the workout does not flow. They just show a screen with what he calls the move and then does it. Boring!"
3,Not Impressed,This video was a disappointment. I would not call it cardio kickboxing. It was more learning punches and kicks and proper technique wasn't even used. If you are looking for a video that will keep your interest and give you an excellent workout then this video is NOT the one for you. I have been in an aerobic kickboxing class and had a much better workout than this tape offered.
2,Boring,I think a video should be fun. Why else would you workout if you did not enjoy doing it? I'm not looking for disneyland but more than basic kicks. I agree with the person who said do the Cindy Crawford video it is a complete workout. Whoever said something bad about it I bet that they've never done it. I'm sure this is a good workout if you don't fall asleep while trying it.
3,Dawei Cardio Kickboxing VHS,"I was little disappointed with this one. I need to teach kickboxing at the gym. I wanted to know how to kick, what is important to kick, and more basic information about jab,cross, hook,upper. He never talked about that. He was just moving. I know this is for advanced people. but we need to know basic movement or we will hurt our body, I think.If you practice at home, you can sweat a lot."
2,Update,Things you need to know. The ends are foam and the tubes are plastic. The tubes are such a tight fit that I was afraid I was going to break the foam. The instructions say to put vasoline on the tubes but who wants the mess. I took some sand paper and enlarged the holes in the foam just enought for the tubes to slide in easily. Now I can adjust the length of the stand and have less of a chance of breaking the foam.
2,Small is not better!,"I bought this volume to introduce my sons to the adventures of Tintin. I wish somewhere in the description it had said the book was a ""pocket size"" or ""travel size"" version. Something is lost in the minature version. I was not happy."
1,ridiculously small font. Unreadable.,The fonts are the smallest that I have seen in a (commercial) printed matter. You can't read them. Returning them and will look for a different copy.
1,Small ain't always beautiful,"The size of the book is pretty small which means that the cartoon graphics and text have all been miniaturized, which makes it not only hard to read, but less enjoyable. The pages are less than 6"" x 8.5"" in either dimension. This is an example of how redesign actually detracts rather than improves. I would strongly urge staying away from it."
1,Too small - I have good eyes and difficult to read,"I loved reading TinTin about 30 yrs ago, but the book was about 8.5""x11"". This book is only 5""x7"", and is hard to read. I was very excited about the books, but now I am very disappointed. Don't waste your time buying the small sized books. If I have a hard time reading, then my kids will too. I have good 20/20 eye site, but won't if I read these books. I am returning the TinTin books I bought, and looking for the larger ones even if it costs more. If I buy them, I want my kids to enjoy them as much as I did when I was young."
4,My kid loves it,"This is a sturdy book, printed and bound well. Since it's apparently a condensation from the original oversize comic, the text is a bit on the small size, though my son hasn't complained. I plan on buying the entire series."
1,What was ordered was not what was delivered,"I ordered this item to replace a lost book from a complete set of seven Tin Tin volumes, and the pictured book was exactly the missing book (generally beige cover). What was delivered was a smaller size, and completely different cover theme (generally dark purple cover). I have to assume that what was pictured simply wasn't available, but I wish Amazon would simply say so, and let ME decide whether to order the one they substituted. It was too much hassle to return it."
1,what are they teaching kids,What are they teaching children this is psychotic this book is designed for 8 and up but the funny thing is tintin runs into a heroen dealing leage and a cult of crazy people who worship Egyptian gods that is sick it is not teaching the next generation anything but drugs arnt that bad that is the only thing this story conveys
2,Long Waiting,"The book arrived in one piece, I mean, in good condition, but it took way too long! I won't buy in this shop again."
4,tintin,this product was very easy to locate and buy and was delivered speedily and in perfect condition so a thumbs up all round
5,reliable,"I am satisfied first-time buyer. my seller agreed to mail my books to an alternative address. Kept in touch with me and kept me informed until I provided the address. mailed the books on time, and i am happy, so is my 13 year old. Thanks again, those books are not available in Trinidad and Tobago, they are great for reading."
4,Tintin is awesome.,"I really like Tintin. The plots of the stories are always great, and I really love reading them. The reason why I like this one, though, is because everything is color. I don't really care whether comic books have colored pages in them or not, but I just think that is is more fun to read them when they do. Another thing about this book is that it has three stories in one book, so you're not spending ten bucks on one little adveture."
5,Bringing Back Tin Tin,"I have known Tin Tin for many, many years, in diverse languages and formats. Am glad that they printed these new editions. My only gripe would be with the size of the book. We were used to larger versions."
1,too small,"I am giving these books one star because I believe the ability to actual make out the text is a fairly important component to a book. My 9 yr old, who has perfect vision, sits with a microscope to read these books. The magic of the illustrations is lost printed this tiny. I don't typically look at the dimensions of a book before I purchase online - but there is no way I would have purchased these books if I had seen them on a shelf. I'll know better next time."
2,"Too small, need magnifying glass, otherwise great.",Love the stories and illustrations except the book is reduced so far as to make a magnifying glass or reading glasses necessary for all but the youngest eyes. I wish the product description had mentioned the book's size.
1,Tintin in Small World,It's a tiny sized Tintin book. One of the wonderful aspects of Tintin is the artwork and the large over-sized books. This is a three volume set in a very small hardcover format. Basically it lost its soul. The pictures are small and the print is deserving of a microscope.
2,This is a small format,The book is fine as far as it goes. But I wish I had realized when I bought it that it was just the original large format comics reduced down to a tiny page size. Makes it hard to read and less engaging. went out and bought the original size ones.
3,Disappointingly small,"As a fan of Tin Tin for many years, I was enthusiastic about getting this version to share with my 2-year-old daughter. The art is still wonderful, but I wish I had paid more attention to the dimensions of the book. It is VERY SMALL, and so is the text. I'm only in my 40s and I can barely read it! If you have a magnifying glass handy, you're in luck. I imagine it's also very good for people who are incredibly nearsighted, or those who require very small hardbound books for travel or storage purposes. Other than that, if you're looking for something you can actually read, with pictures large enough to see detail, check out other offerings. This book is beautifully made...I just can't read it."
1,Disappointed with print,Few folks here have mentioned it here...it is very small print not original size print so not easy to read...otherwise Tintin is always great.
1,"Reduced too much, strains the eyes","The TinTin books are as wonderful as ever, but this edition shrinks each page to the point that it's difficult to read."
4,Book - Adventures of TinTin,Ordered this for a Christmas present. It arrived in good time. Thought the print was a little small but my Grandson said that is just what he wanted. Larger type would make the book too big. He was happy with it.
5,Susan Heeley's Review,I had to do a french project on Tintin. I had to act out six pages of Le Lotus Bleu or The blue Lotus. I got an A on the project thanks to the book. For fun I read the whole book. I love Tintin. The book was in fine shape when I recieved it.
1,Lame lame lame,"Cliche upon derivative cliche. A waste of your time.Wooden acting, laboured plot, poor characterisation and Joan Severnace looking old."
1,"Been there, done that...","Suspense thrillers are supposed to keep you guessing, I guess. Unfortunately, this film offers little in the way of plot twists beyond the standard devices you've seen a hundred times before. Patrick Bergin looks like he's in it strictly for the money and Joan Severance hides behind layers of pancake to disguise her wrinkles. Take a pass."
5,Exposes you to a series of exercises that help,"This book is simple, concrete, and to the point. It will help you develop various directing techniques, and it will leave the rest up to you. Its purpose is not to try and train you into some special type of director, but to give you the basic technical skills that will allow you to find your own artistic style. It is most certainly a great book to start with, and its exercises would likely help more advanced directing students hone their skills."
5,Delightful to the senses,"The first and the best (in my opinion) of these wonderful compilation cd's, although Elevation 3 has some great stuff on it too. I just couldn't get into Elevation 2 for some reason. I HIGHLY recommend Elevation and Elevation 3 for fans of New Age, who like a little Celtic and Jazz mixed in for good measure. I can hardly wait for their next one! For additional compilations such as these, check out ""The Best New Age"" volumes (six in all, I believe), that feature EKO, CUSCO, NEAL SCHON (great! -who'd of thought?), and lots more. I have 3 of these, all great. They may be out of print, but I think you can still get them here on Amazon or Cdnow, or your local used cd trading store. Enjoy!"
3,Elevations: Jumping right in.,"This is one of those c.d.'s where it takes more than one listening to get used to. However, there are three especially catchy tunes that helps this c.d. jump through the hoop. They are the beautifully euphoric ""Librarsi"" by Marcome with her sophistocated vocals, the curious ""Free Fall"" by Mars Lasar, and the tricky ""Sure As Not"" by Afro Celt Sound System. As for the rest of the c.d., there is light at the end of the tunnel. The Elevations series is designed to expose you to different types of music that you would not have otherwise been exposed to, and which you might actually enjoy."
5,Southern Gospel Music,"Toe tapping southern gospel music that is such fun to listen to. This CD contains some of the finest gospel singers in America and most of them are featured in group as well as solo performances.If you are a person who enjoys southern gospel music, this is for you. If not, then leave it alone, not something you would enjoy. I can say without question, I love this type of music and enjoy listening to it many times.The CD was in excellent condition and was shipped to me in a timely manner, so thank you for that."
3,Not Much to be Excited About,"This CD is just fine, but nothing special. I still prefer either ""Chalk Mark in a Rain Storm"" or ""Dog Eat Dog""."
5,Grammy Winner.,"This is the best, most consistent work Joni has done since 1977's Don Juan's Reckless Daughter. Ten songs that all fit together nicely. This album reminds you that Joni was first in the singer-songwriter-folk genre, and it reminds you that there are more important things to life than just cotton candy love songs. This is what our teenagers should be listening to."
3,It's The Bomb!!!!!,"I've heard touching songs before but never like 'So In Love', It's got everything a man should say to a woman,It makes a woman feel special and on top of the WORLD!! I ain't married yet but one day It's gonna be dedicated to the one I'll Marry.I Love the part when they say 'the air that I breathe even speaks of you' [darn] THESE GUYS!!! Where ya at???"
5,A Classic to be remembered,"I have been searching high and low for this CD for the last few years. I have been looking for it as I want to use ""So in love with you"" for the bride's march down the aisle when I get married. If you don't have this CD in your slow jam and R&B collection, then you're missing out."
4,I wish they were together,This is a CD I once had. I really liked the CD. Now I have a chance to hear these songs again.
3,nice,"I'm not really 13, but I thought it was ok. It was my favorite song for a wedding before, now it's okay, it got old.I liked it when I was 19, now I don't. four years later, it's old now."
3,Supplement to other travel guides,"Its nice and tiny enough to put in your purse and it does have some nice maps at the end of the book. That said, the book is hard to follow with detailed descriptions (unless you have another travel guide to see as well)It does have some nice recommendations for travellers especially those on a low budget and it is worth supplementing a book like ""Eyewitness Travel Guides: Australia"""
4,humor and diet,"Contains a wealth of knowledge of diet and nutrition and several interesting recipes that I have already tried. The book is well written and the author has a sense of humor. I only wish there were more recipes. I am white and unfamiliar with some of the food, but I am having a wonderful time learning. It is fun to go to the supermarket and seek out some of these products. I enjoyed the book thoroughly.Mary Lou Wood"
4,Very Informative!,"This book was a little repetitive, but all in all.... very informative!!!! This book is similar to the 3 hour diet."
3,Better on vinyl,"For some reason, this album sounds better on vinyl. Maybe because that's how I bought it originally. It was white vinyl, too. This album really rocks in places, and kind of peters out elsewhere. I like about 40% of it. Belly's debut, ""Star"" is really the one to get first. This one has rather heavy-handed production by old-pro Glyn Johns. Not that it's bad, but Tanya Donelly's ""little girl"" persona on ""Star"" is totally gone on ""King"". If you can deal with that rather jarring change, then give this a try. The two are completely different albums, almost sounding like two different bands. Belly kicked it up live supporting this album, but it just didn't get the radio play that ""Star"" did, so the band called it quits. Oh well, it was fun while it lasted."
5,Wonderful album,"""King"" by Belly was the album I listened to after ""Star"" and I personally think it's a much better album. Star, to me, seemed unfinished in areas and very much a debut album. ""King"" has so much more life and song-structure with wonderful melodies. I loved this album from the opening song, ""Puberty"", which is also my favorite track on the album. This is a great alternative album with songs that are easily understood and can be sung along with. Catchy songs! Great album! A must buy! ;o)"
4,Graduate High School in the Late 90's??....,"...Then you would be familiar with Belly. They had a few hits. Nothing too spectacular. But the songs will bring you back to the days of Blind Melon, the 'Cannonball...Crash' song, and well, yeah, Nirvana.The lead singer in Belly has a childlike, slightly scratchy, Juliana Hatfield-reminiscent voice. Crazy, Bjork-like lyrics that only make sense when you jump up and down really fast in a dancing frenzy.In my mind, definately 4 stars -- a great CD! And one of the few from my teenage days that I will swear to always hold onto.Buy this CD. Sit down with a bowl of ice cream. And flip through your yearbook."
4,A Lost Gem,"As I recall, this disc came out with some hype about Belly being the next big thing. Unfortunately, in the midst of the Pearl Jam-esque wave of flannel toting bands, that didn't happen. But nearly 10 years later, this disc sounds as fresh as the day it was released. Loaded with hooks that will haunt you, I find King to be more satisfying than Star. Too bad the talented and beautiful Tanya Donnelly didn't become a household name."
4,Quality and quantity...,"I just listened to this album after a long hiatus and was very surprised by its consistent quality. I am most definitely a Breeders/Belly/Kelly Deal/etc., partisan but speaking as objectively as I can Tanya Donelly serves up 11 very solid tracks here, though some are more solid than others (4 may be my favorite...)."
5,Quick delivery,This book arrived in a few days and was in great condition. Would buy from this seller again.
4,Portal of Fire,"Mega Bloks has done it again! This was the first of the Mega Bloks series Fire & Ice that I got. Thoron didnt look that cool on the front of the box, but when I built him, I saw how cool he really is! He could harness the power of both fire & ice and could choose either side to fight with. I dont like how his wrists are connected to his arms using ball joints. His arms should be able to bend at the elbows. When the set is totally built its very interesting to look at and even better to play with. You should get this set as it is the core of the series and explains everything. I cant wait till the new metal ages toys come out because they look awesome! Continue the Legend!"
2,Disappointing. Very disappointing.,"I was really expecting a lot more from Al. When I compare this to all previous Ministry discs, it just doesn't compare. And yet, I still hesitate to say it's completely bad. I've been able to salvage a bit of halfway decent material out of it. ""Brick Windows"" is, in my opinion, the best song on the disc, although that really isn't saying too much. It has a nice beat, and I could bop to it, but the rest of the album is really very disappointing. Al Jourgensen, once among the godly of industrial artists, has fallen. 'Tis sad, really. 2 out of 5."
4,atmospheric,"I've used these songs in countless student films to get that doomy, steamy, and haunted effect. I'm not big on the singles that we released off this one, like ""Reload."" But ""Dead Guy"" and ""Gameshow"" just define Ministry for me. Slow, droning, tubes so over-driven they could cook eggs, drums that sound like breaking glass. The emotion that this ablum and ""Dark Side of the Spoon"" pulls from me is something I try and put into my own music. It might not be dance hall, but it's definately art."
5,One of their best albums ever!,"At first, I hated this album. I put in a tape of it a friend had made for me, expecting something like Mind or Pslam 69, and got something completely different. Looking back on it, the reason I didnt like it was because it wasnt what I expected. But I listened to it a few more times, and realized just how good it really is. It's slower than any of the other albums (except for With Simpathy, of course), but it is definetly the heaviest. It is loaded with good tracks, and Al still sounds the same as ever. I couldnt say which song was my favorite, because I dont think I have any one. Some of the better ones were Useless, Lava and Reload (no relation to that god-awful Metalica album). I would recoment this album to all the fans of Ministry, or anyone who just likes heavy industrial / metal music. Al Jourgensen, I worship you!"
2,Crash and Burn,"this Cd puts me into a coma. its so damn slow, i can't listen to it without getting bored right away. it has only has two good tracks: ""Reload"" and ""Brick Windows"" which are (Fortunately) really good. if you're one of those metal fans who are now coming to their senses by trying industrial rock then you should probably warm up to the genre with this album."
1,Boring,"This is Ministry's worst release; it is nothing more than a slow, somewhat grinding metal album. The guitars sound as if they belong on something with a faster tempo, but instead they have been sludged down almost to the point of being in reverse. Besides this, Filth Pig is in serious need of synthesizers and samples. The classic sound of Ministry is a synthesis of Slayer-influenced metal with industrial programming and sampling, making the music easy to dance to as well as to thrash to. Unfortunately, this album will not want to lead the listener to do either one of those things. Also, the song-writing is lacking in creativity, and Filth Pig is nothing more than an incredible bore."
4,an experimental industrial masterpiece,"""Filth Pig,"" which is probably Ministry's second-most lambasted album (alongside 1999's ""Dark Side of the Spoon""), is admittedly a slab of sludgy, disagreeable, industrial-metal noise... But it is also, in my opinion, one of the best albums this influential band has put out. This time around, Al & Paul chuck the speed-metal goodness that gave them their name in favor of slow, noisy songs drawn out to considerable length, with incredible results. Granted, this could have been a disastrous experiment in the hands of mediocre talent, but Ministry give each and every song their own bizarre flavor, and the album flows well. The tightly-knit sounds of ""Reload,"" ""Filth Pig,"" and ""Lava"" (the 1st three tracks) lay down what to expect, with Al's vulgar, distorted vox sounding madder than ever. Aside from those songs, my other favorites are ""Dead Guy,"" ""The Game Show,"" and ""The Fall,"" although almost everything on ""Filth Pig"" is a triumphant standout.Highly recommended."
3,Wow...heavy.,"At first, I must admit, I hated this album. Its brooding (relatively) soft nature turned me off on the first few listens and it collected dust on my CD rack for awhile before I gave it a listen on some bored evening with nothing better to do.It had already been established that I liked the first track, but the rest of the album I had problems with. It sounded like the lead singer's voice was filtered through a length of sewer pipe and the backing music was overly dull so I didn't pay it much attention, simply a bad purchase. On my second listen, though, I noticed that while I still think, in some way, think my aforementioned critiques were true there's also something to be said for the stark, brooding mood that the tracks on 'Filth Pig' evoke on a lonely, overcast day. This still isn't my favorite Ministry album, but it is effectively depressing and not as horrible as I first believed."
5,one of the best dark industrial albums ever,"Al Jourgenson is certainly one of the more interesting and "" mysterious"" people in music today. Most of Ministry's music is good, though it tends not to take itself too seriously. On this album Al Jourgenson stops just having fun and makes something deep, serious, and intense. my favorite of all his albums, this is a must have for anyone who likes music that means something and is heavy without being typical metal. in my opinion its one of the top ten best albums ever. my only complaint is that i wish Jourgenson would include lyric sheets, for his tremolo and pitch shift vocal effects sometimes make the words diffictul to decipher...though they add a brilliant growl to the sound of the vocals."
3,so so...,"so so ....gdflkgmokfsdmlglkd ldñlll,lglghññrgdffdgfddfg ddgedrgsdffggfg dim sorry, i had a chicken bone choking"
4,One more thing...,"I wanted to add... I generally find the amazon.com music reviews quite good, surprisingly so in many cases. It's one of the reasons I shop here. However, to refer to ""Home Is Where the Heart Is"" as an ""antihomophobia song"" is pretty outrageous, in my opinion. That song is not *anti* anything. It is pure affirmation. It's a beautiful song about love, compassion and understanding. You really should change your review.... Yours, Mark Lane (NY)"
2,Aging isn't pretty,"The version of 'River of Jordan' on this album discards the original lyrics for a more politically correct version. . . what was once ""we are the father, we are the son"" has PC'd into ""we are the father, mother daughter and son"". What a disaster, adding extra syllables and a new meaning completely ruins the tempo and bastardizes the beautiful original tune. This is what happens when liberal PC sentiments muscle out innocence.A few of the songs on this album hold up and work well with the new collaborations, but River of Jordan isn't one of them."
2,Boring Sentimentality,"I am a PP&M fan, but this album left me cold. The selection of songs was relatively uninspired given the repertoire, but it was the vocal interpretations that made it a snoozer. Even one of my all-time favorite songs, ""Stewball,"" was performed in such a weepy, sappy manner that it called for a fast forward.The use of guest artists seemed like an afterthought. If you are going to use a John Sebastian or a Tom Paxton, why not feature one of their own great songs?I suppose there are folks who will get into this. You know, the type who get teary eyed singing ""Kumbaya"" around a camp fire. But, with the exception of an upbeat one-time throwaway called ""Virtual Party,"" this album was a virtual desert."
5,"Great readings, but out of stock...",Great Jewish Liturgical Feasts is the only unaccompanied readings in Hebrew I've found and as per usual the recording has lapsed out of print. Even after the religious 'chant' trend Jewish presence has been nil. It's a shame.
1,Dead on arrival,Bought this for my wife's Palm Trio 750. Put the battery in and tried to charge the phone. Absolutely will not charge at all. Zero. Nothing. Returning the battery.
1,Never arrived,"It has never arrived, but due to costs of shipping and bureaucracy on it. I didn't care."
2,It's the same weak battery...,I only buy it because I must to have a battery backup for long trips and I can't wait for the seidios battery.
1,Paper weight,I ordered two set of Treo 750 battery. One was fine. The other was just like a Paper weight. Cheep battery is something like this.
1,The Treo 680 battery is dreadful,"Well the only good thing one can say about the Treo 680 battery is that it's thinner. The battery for the Treo 650 basically got one through a normal business day. As the Treo 680 battery only lasts a 4-5 hours under business use, the descriptive adjectives that come to mind are: deplorable, distressing, lamentable, unsatisfactory and unsuitable.I'm really dissapointed that Palm delivered such as lousy battery with the Treo 680. But happily, there is a quick fix, buy 1-2 more batteries and keep them charged and don't leave home without them ;-)"
1,Food Crusher and Sprayer,"Worst product ever...don't know how it passed through initial testing. When you turn the crank to dispense cereal, it crushes it and sprays it ALL OVER the room. Awful, just awful. Too embarrassed to even give it away so put it in the trash. Waste of money and space. And we tried dog food, which is too hard for it to crush so it just got stuck. Really made me angry that I wasted the money. False advertising."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY,"SAVE YOUR MONEY. HAVE TRIED DUAL CEREAL DISPENSER FROM JC PENNY'S. AGAIN SAVE YOUR MONEY. CRUSH,JAM,FLEMSY,MESSY, ETC. . NOT KID FRIENDLY !!NOT WORTH THE MONEY. USE TUPPERWARE UNTIL SOMEONE MAKES THIS PRODUCT PROPERLY..."
1,Good idea but...,"An attractive, well priced and bright idea, however we are returning this item. It is too tall to fit in the space between my counter top and the cabinets below. We liked the way it looked so we thought we'd clear out the bottom shelf inside one of my cabinets. Being the dispenser was so tall we needed to remove the shelf above as well. When I realized how much room it took up and how many things it was displacing I realized it was defeating my original plan. So back it goes."
4,I give it 4 stars for its handiness...,"I have not had a chance to use my cereal dispenser, but I do look forward to using it. I, too, was not very satisfied with the color. I was expecting a white dispenser, which would have matched my kitchen appliances, and I got the creamish, off white dispenser. I learned a few techniques from the other reviews on how to use the dispenser to avoid crushing my cereal. I will check back at a later date and rate how my family and I like it. I definitely love the idea of not using cereal boxes and having to worry about if my husband or son will close the sack appropriately so the cereal will remain fresh. That was a definitely plus for me.I guess I will see how things go!!!"
4,cereal dispenser,The dispenser is very nice for storing cereal in and easy to use. It does however make a little mess when turning the cereal out of it into a bowl. Still it was well worth it.
2,Couldn't Finish,I gave this book up after a hundred or so pages without the giraffe in question showing up.
4,"Another work of ""light history""","If you are between serious history books, or if you just like to dabble in history & enjoy a curious story around which a broader tale of culture can be told, this is a nice volume. Allin is a very good writer, holds your attention throughout with a trail of trivia, all held together by the story of this giraffe. I read the book in a couple of days & have now went ahead & circulated to friends of mine who, like me, travel alot on airplanes. This is the perfect book for a long airplane flight."
3,Flawed but fascinating,"A quirky but insightful and highly entertaining book, Zarafa was poorly edited, per style as well as fact-checking. Try Max Rodenbeck's Cairo: The City Victorious to get the a more accurate -- and immensely entertaining -- perspective on Egyptian history.Nonetheless, Allin's main topic is fascinating. Fewer (and more carefully researched) digressions would have made Zarafa a better book, but it's a terrific read regardless."
4,good easy read,"it was a bit rambling or else i would have given it 5 stars, and i would have liked a little more information on giraffes,per se., its a definte read"
3,A good book but is pointless and stays too long with prose,"This is a good book but it is wrapped up with prose and serves very little purpose as a non-fictional story and obviously serves very little purpose as a historical reference. However, tthe author is able at some points to engage us in his characters and the big one; the giraffe itself."
5,Looking for paperback,You do not mention availability of this title in soft-back. Do you have it? ISBN 0385334117Ellis Wayne Please respond. Thank you.
5,Delightful,This is a surprising little book that tells you so much more than the adventures of a giraffe on her way to post-revolutionary France. Anyone interested in Eqyptology or the Ottoman Empire will also be surprised by the little tit-bits of information that drift by in the story telling. One of the delights of this season
4,A fantastic project half accomplished!,"""Zarafa"" has been an enlightening piece of work for me. Mr. Allin weaves a very colorful background for the gift, the giraffe, from Egypt to France. Or he tries to, at least. I've learned a lot of historical and geographical details from the book, in addition to the giraffe's long journey. However, in trying to incorporate too much history into this little lovely story, Mr. Allin's sometimes disregards the revelance of such facts. As a result, the story of the leading lady is left half told while the structure of the book seems loose. In other words, the writing isn't good enough for the story. In reflecting on this book, another book came to mind. Mark Kurlansky's ""Cod-A biography of the fish that changed the world"" is one of the most charming books I've read in many years. Also created out of an interesting animal story, Mr. Kurlansky writes beautifully, too."
1,Intriguing story lost in convoluted details and prose,"The story of Zarafa is intriguing as political, scientific, and social history. Thank you to Allin for bringing it to our attention. Unfortunately, the author's telling of the tale is a tangle of poorly crafted prose and convoluted, repetitive detail. The uneveness of his writing disasterously distracts from the story. Instead of enjoying his juxtapositions of fact and fantasy I spent my time frustratedly wishing an editor had intervened before publication."
3,gift,A gift to my mother who had read about it and so I sent one to her. She thought it was okay not outstanding Think she was a little disappointed in it.
4,A Novel of Illusion--and Disillusion,"In ""Free Live Free,"" Gene Wolfe again displays his rare ability to present what appears to be a straight-forward, almost cliched plot (four characters in search of their heart's desires) and gently nudges it towards something much deeper and haunting. Do the characters find what they are looking for? Well, yes. And no.This book is a must for Wolfe fans--hunt it down. (My local library had a copy.) It's also not a bad introduction to Wolfe for new readers. Anyone who likes David Lynch movies or the X Files will like this book. Its reality-based fantasy makes you wonder about all those assumptions you've been carrying around."
3,"To a point, fascinating reading","Free Live Free has some brilliant moments, and some very well drawn characters. Unfortunately, the reading experience for me was badly damaged by the ending. Without writing any spoilers, let me simply say that Wolfe seems to have sidestepped the obvious choice by picking another one, one that instead of working well, what he did seemed entirely out of keeping with the rest of the novel. Still worth reading."
1,Hoped for too much - ended in disappointment,"Whilst the charaterizations and story development kept my rapt attention during the telling of the tale, to say I was disappointed by the ending would be an understatement. Its been a long time since a book that I enjoyed reading so much left me hanging limp and disappointed by an ending which seemed more of an excuse for lack of imagination than anything else. I've read a lot of Wolfe's other works and have not, so far, been let down by those works. Where was he when he wrote the ending to this one? Hard to say, but his mind didn't seem to have been on the job."
2,Wading through sand,"Hmm. Perhaps I was not in the correct mind set to read this. Perhaps I have read too many of this genre before and I am all maxed out - but the first half was a laborious read. Nothing snappy, notable, interesting or magnetic about the writing style, that's for sure. And instructive books DON'T have to be boring in writing style.Some of the pscychology-based concepts were interesting, but there was nothing here that hooked me, drew me in, educated or inspired me. No ""aha"" moments - not a one.And when I got to the part where Mr Keating ascribes difficult childhood behaviour to the parent, well, I'm sorry... this is when I had to put it down, and I'm afraid I haven't picked it up again. I was looking for enlightenment in a psychological sense, not subective opinion on parenting issues. Monsieur Spock, he is Not.Overall, this was just average to me. I'll try it again in a year, but I do have a feeling that the spine of this book is going to remain pristine."
3,Rafe's New Bride,"Rafe a little slow on the up take is not slow in ordering himself a wife by mail order to gain control over the family ranch. Emmeline afraid that she has gone the way of her Aunt becomes a mail order bride. She was married by proxy and left to meet her new groom. This is a fun book to read and you will like it. You experience all of your emotions with this tale of Rafe and Emmeline. By Ruth Thompson the author of ""Natchez Above The River"""
2,Did I read the same book?,"I was surprised by all the great reviews for this book. I found it to be extremely dull compared to some of Miller's other work. I didn't connect at all with the characters and wondered when it was exactly that Rafe and Emmeline fell in love. I did manage to get to the last page, but I was not impressed. It was quite a disappointment because I expected much more from Miller, as I usually enjoy her books."
3,A Few Discrepancies,"The beginning of this book was really good, and I had high hopes that the rest of the book would be as good, but I was somewhat disappointed.I know the book is just fiction, but when I read something, I don't like discrepancies. They are distracting. For instance, when Rafe wraps her in the bath towel, takes her upstairs where he lays her down on the bed. Then he removes her nightgown. Huh? When did she put on the nightgown?There were other parts of this story that didn't make any sense to me, but overall, it was Okay."
5,Enjoyable,"A wonderful start to Linda Miller's McKettrick series. Loved the Mail-order bride storyline. Rafe is determined to win the competition and inherit the Triple M ranch. You'll laugh and at times want to hit Rafe over the head. I have read all the McKettrick series and enjoyed them all, have even read some of them twice.Would love to see more of the McKettrick's."
5,Owl^Lady,This is a very good book. Keeps you interested through the whole book. You want be disappointed. She a good writer. I recommend getting all her books.
3,..........Loved It,"I have read a lot of romance novels in my day but I truly enjoyed this one. Rafe was a great character and I got so involved in the book I wanted to cry right along with Emmeline. I especially like the fact that nobody knows Angus's secret. I can't wait for the next two books. Although I'm not sure if they'll be about Jeb, Kade, or Holt. What do you say Ms. Miller about four instead of a trilogy."
3,"Fun, fast read","The first in a new series, HIGH COUNTRY BRIDE was a quick, entertaining read. It is the fairly fast-paced tale of Rafe McKettrick, one of three brothers forced to compete to be the first to produce an heir in order to inherit a sizeable ranch, and Emmeline Harding, niece of a brothel madam, and, maybe, a prostitute, who is his mail-order bride. This novel is thick with fun, interesting characters, love (so many couples!!), and a certain amount of mystery in the shape of one ""Sister Mandy"" who everyone doubts is actually a nun. I look forward to seeing how marriage turns out for the other McKettrick boys."
3,Charming western romance,"Emmeline Harding grew up in a brothel, shielded by her loving & protective aunt (the madam). One night she decides to don sexy clothes and get a glimpse of the world of the ladies of the night. She meets a handsome stranger, drinks too much wine & wakes up in a bed, with a handful of gold coins left for her. She decides to change her life, and ansers an ad from the Happy Home Matrimonial Service. She is married by proxy and goes out west to meet her groom. Rafe McKettrick, has lead a life of carousing. Now, the only wat he can inherit the triple M ranch is to produce a legetimate grandchild. He requests a mail order bride ""healthy, with good teeth. must want children. soon."" What he gets goes far beyond his request, as Emmeline and Rafe fall madly in love.Sensuality rating = 7"
4,A-3 Skywarrior,"The A-3 in action series book is 50 pages jam-packed with very rare photos and methodically steps through the history of the ""Whale"". The A-3 started out as the Navy's strategic nuclear delivery platform and due to it's size (large but within limits of the CV) routinely operated off of carriers and subsequently went on to fill other vital roles. This book details the design, flight test, and development as an A-3A, A-3B, Tanker, Trainer, E-Recon, Jammer, Photo-Recon, Tanker-Jammer, and FEWSG ERA-3B birds. It has sketches, photos, line drawings, specifications, full color photos, cockpit pictures, overseas operations, ECM/Weapon blisters and so on and so forth. The only thing the book doesn't have in great detail is the use of the Whale as a testbed (it's current job). This is a must have book for anyone who flew on the A-3 Skywarrior."
1,"Buy the original, the revised edition is terrible","The beauty of the ORIGINAL edition of this book is its simplicity and its straightforward style. It was/is the ultimate how to write a novel if you also have to have a day job guide.This second edition is full of hot air! It's laden with jargon and complex diagrams, assumes the reader knows way too much. Concedes completely that writers should adjust their vision because today's readers have been corrupted by TV and film. I STRONGLY disagree with the shift in focus from character to plot. I too will hang on to my worn copy of the original.Don't bother buying this one. It's not worth the money."
2,Totally agree - Get the original,"I've owned both editions and I totally agree with previous reviewers about preferring the original version. The older version analyzes one book (""The Accidental Tourist"") that is easy to get new or used, and won't eat too significantly into time you should be writing instead of reading. The newer version analyzes several books which starts to look more like a book on literary criticism rather than on the writing process. The original is much more process-oriented, since the goal of the reader of this specific book is to get words on the page, not just broaden the amount of novels on the shelf.Overall, I was disappointed. I thought the newer version was long-winded with lots of unnecessary filler that hindered more than helped. Get the original. It's worth it."
1,boilerplate,"To each his own. If this book helps you, that's great.But I put down novel writing for awhile after trusting this guy's methodology. It was poison for my writing. It wasn't until I threw this collection of professor's notes from a college writing course that I picked it back up & published my first novel.Caveat emptor."
5,First edition is great!,"I have not read the second edition, but after reading the other reviews, I surely won't bother to get it. I have the older first edition, very plain cover, and it's fantastic. I am writing on a regular basis now, guided step by step, and I am getting great results that I'm happy with. I agree with a previous reviewer that using the same book for examples all the way through is very effective. It also probably helps that I personally love The Accidental Tourist, too. The first edition is very uplifting and encouraging -- it says honestly that sure, some moments as a writer are likely to feel difficult now and then, but don't worry - here's how to cope with those moments and then move forward to greatness! For the First Edition - highly recommended."
5,Refreshing and cool,"Like a splash of aftershave in the morning or a coat of aloe vera on sunburned skin, this CD is a bracing antidote to the same old thing being churned out by the record conglomerates.Few folks realize what a long, potent career Albert has had, from Heads, Hands, and Feet, to Emmylou's Hot Band, to even trading licks with Jeff Beck on an Eddie Harris CD! This country-tinged collection of 8 choice cuts is good music for riding along a river or just repainting the back porch."
1,don't waste your time,"this is by far one of the stupidest games i have ever played. I do fire/rescue in real life and this game is in no way accurate. I didn't expect a 100% accurate depication of firefighting, but the creators of this game should have consulted someone that at least understands fire behavior and fire suppresion theories. after about the 4th stage of spraying water on fire and rescuing people i was bored. they should have incorporated other tasks into this crap game."
3,FD 18 Reviewed,I saw previews at this game and thought a fire fightning game that looks interesting so I thought I would check it out. I rented this game and it was not the best but not the worst. The missions can get very frustrating when you get farther because you have a time limit to save people. I thought this game deserved 3 stars because of the difficulty setting and the repitive lines the characters said during the game so if you play this a while and mute the game you will probably then enjouy it.My friend who is a firefighter loved this game though and said it deserved 5 stars but thats probably only because hes a firefighter but if you are a ff then go out and buy it otherwise just rent it first.
3,Expensive,"This is a very cute onsie. However, it is overpriced. I purchased this for a gift. I wouldn't have paid $18 for a onsie for myself."
5,Nice product,"I bought this for my grandma who had an old ice bag. And well, it came nicely packaged and the materials were cold resistant so she could just place it on every part of her body and not have a cold spot. It's awesome and big, you could feel it with plenty of ice. I recommend this product and I would buy again."
5,Multi purpose,"I use this mostly for my heat related headaches. Fill it with ice, add a little water and INSTANT relief. It works for every part of the body but you do have to 'hold' this one where you want it to stay, unless you want it on the top of your head then it stays just fine."
2,A disappointment,"After reading the first two Mary Russell books, beginning with The Beekeeper's Apprentice, this third novel was a disappointment. It had such an excellent premise with a letter that could shed new light on early Christianity and the roles women played in its development. Instead the letter says almost nothing of importance. King spends several chapters on Mary Russell invading the life of one of the suspects and yet that suspect turns out to have nothing, nothing to do with plot. First person narrative fails King here as the more interesting plot is told second hand by Holmes. This book is saved by its premise alone and fails everywhere else almost completely. I hope King finds the charm that captivated readers in The Beekeeper's Apprentice in her future works."
2,A very disappointing book,"This book lacks a coherent plot, and has an extremely unconvincing ending. The feeling one gets is that the writer suddenly decided that she'd written enough words, and would wrap it up in quick time. I hope Holmes and Russell will start to do some honest detecting again real soon. The great detective deserves a better life!"
3,Disappointing finish to the Mary trilogy.,"I sometimes wonder whether the wonderful ""Beekeeper's Apprentice"" was really sent to King in a suitcase and it's sequals are merely pale imitations by the idea-starved author. Indeed, apart from the genuine, fluid 1920s London style, there is little in common in the way of quality, between Apprentice and it's sequals. The plot in ""Letter"" is even more thin than that of ""Monstrous"", the lengthy 'colonel' sidetract only serves to demonstrate King's passion for feminist and theological themes but do nothing to advance the already over-stretched plot. King's tendency to over-preach her themes no doubt irritates many readers (including this one!). The book only sparks to life in the all too brief moments shared between the Great Detective and his protegee. As a previous reader remarked - any Mary book is better than the average in this genre. ""Monstrous"" and ""Letter"" however, are disappointing let-down to the potential promised in ""Beekeeper."""
3,The letter of Mary does not relate to the mystery at all.,"It was just a way of bringing the death to the Holmes' doorstep -- I found it a bit of a letdown. Also thought there was a little too much empathy on the part of Russell in relating her trauma to their lone witness. However, it was fun to meet Lord Peter Wimsey right in the middle of the story. The plot could have been better."
3,Interesting story,"Not my favorite of the series, and delving into Christian dogma isn't exactly my favorite topic for leisure reading, but it was well done."
2,Did anyone notice a similarity to ...,"Everytime I read one of King's books, I cannot help but draw a parallel to one of Anne Perry's fabulous Pitt novels, especially Callander Square and Bethlehem Road. There always seem to be similarities of plot situations that seem too much coincidence."
3,Mis-titled but compelling story,"The Beekeeper's Apprentice hooked me completely, and Mary Russell continues to fascinate. A Letter of Mary has too little of Holmes and too little of the letter - aside from introducing the issue of women's historical role in religion it seems to disappear. While the story then revolves around women in religion, I was disappointed that Mary - and Holmes - did so little deduction. Not up to Beekeeper's standard."
3,"Somewhat disappointing, like Episode 6 of Star Wars","What is it about #3? Third books always fall flat, as do third movies (see above), In my opinion and A Letter of Mary is no exception. I read the teaser at the end of Monstrous Regiment and I couldn't wait until I got the book! But the historical center of this work--a letter purporting to have been written on papyrus by Mary of Magdala--which could have been so exciting and important, I felt was consigned to a lesser role in the plot development. The long awaited marriage of Holmes and Mary was also disappointing. Mary and Holmes are bored (Mary repeatedly worries about this), and that lassitude really permeated the book for me. The character development that has been so exciting in the series so far is largely irrelevant here. My fingers are tightly crossed that the jinx will be broken in book 4, The Moor..."
3,so-so,"I loved the Beekeeper's apprentice, the first in this series, but this one didn't keep me spellbound. It was boring in places but I trudged through it. Don't know if I'll continue reading her mysteries."
5,Great series,This a great series. I recommend any book in this series. I can't wait for the next one to come out!
5,"Good, but not as good as the first book","This book is good, but not as good as ""The Beekeeper's Apprentice"".If you like Mary Russel novels and have already read ""The Beekeeper's Apprentice"" and""A Mounstrous Regiment of Women"",then this is a must read. P.S.One thing I don't understand;why do Holmes and Russel keep on calling each other by their last names when they're married?"
2,King Runs Out of Narrative Steam,"While I enjoyed the first two books as light reading, this third one puts an end to my reading of the Mary Russell series. The first two books proved entertaining despite various problems with characters and grating little errors, but the thin plot sinks this third book. The characters seem less developed and less interesting here, and most of the book is given over to false trails and irrelevant theological musings.I have decided after finishing this third book to stick with Elizabeth Peters as my mystery writer of choice; her Amelia Peabody series does a lot more with the same time period and features stronger, more lively writing and characters. If you like academic period mysteries with female detectives, I suggest the Peabody books or Stephanie Barron's Jane Austen series instead."
1,Not quite as described,"You should know that CD#2 is for Spanish speakers, and that other parts require you to choose to work in Italian, Spanish, German or French. The fifth CD is a Spanish to English dictionary. So, if Spanish is your mother tongue, this may be useful. If you speak a non-European language, it will be of limited use.In general, the quality is not high. A clip-art dachshund with a tail with motion lines is used for please or thank you (I forget which), but many people will probably fail to get the connection."
4,Instant Results,I bought this for a spanish speaking employee. She came back the next day speaking some words in english. She was so happy and thankful.
4,Well written biography,"This book is a well written biography of Admiral Cunningham, or ABC as he was known in the service. Many people consider ABC the greatest Admiral since Nelson, which is quite a high expectation.The writing does not drag, as many biographies do. And while the writer obviously admires ABC, and puts him on a pedestal it is not a real tall pedestal.Now, why did I give the book four stars and not five? Two reasons. First, the book skips quickly through ABC's early life and career, and almost completly avoids ABC's part in WWI, which he spent largely commanding a destroyer. Second, while he gives an excellent description of the Battle of Mattapan, ABC's largest fleet action, he fails to indicate why the battle was important.All in all, if you like biographies or naval history, this book would be an excellent addition to your library."
5,Great Show,"Kenichi: the mightiest disciple is a great show that has a great message for anyone. The second season is just as good as the first. The show if fun to watch with its perfect combination of humor, action and slight fan service. This is a show that is worth watching."
4,Great Anime,I was a good solid story line and great action! There arn't any super hero powers like in most but there are some good ancient secret marshal arts.
3,You have to watch and see. Note a Spoiler touch.,"I was disappointed with Kenichi's wining and fleeing type of character, but what made up for it was when he used the new technique he learned, whenever he had to protect someone. I was into the more serious mode of him. My rating was based on the unanswered Questions about Miou's parents, if Kenichi every got strong enough to even come close to Miou's superior fighting skills. Because his training was focused with the masters, I felt he should of become a better fighter. If this really isn't the end I'd change my rating to a 4. This series is built like a long series anime usually is. I hope they don't stop there. There's also the Chinese master's daughter that had an unfinished plot too. The fights are good though! That's where I throw my highest rating."
3,not sure how effective it is,"I tried one container which, when taken daily, lasts about 2 weeks. I still got a cold and had allergy problems while taking it, but perhaps I did not stay on it long enough. The product contains stevia, which left a bitter aftertaste even though I mixed it with fruit in a smoothie, so I am reluctant to continue trying it."
3,OLD - not bad- recordings,"Old recordings of spanish songs. As you may think by the title, the songs are not only about the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939) but actually popular songs - some that are dated more than a hundred years before (1800's) - which were re-used (some unmodified) during the war against fascism. The CD has a little introduction to the songs and translations to english/french/spanish; it does not have any info about the date / artist / origin of the recordings."
3,historical traditional songs,Its a same that you include a political review as a musical evaluation of this record. this music is for folk students or historical archive music lovers. If this songs was singing for the republicans is not relevant about the review.
3,Another Fun Sticker Book,"If you are the parent of a young child, you probably know who Maisy is. She's a mouse with a duck, a squirrel, an elephant, and a crocodile for friends. Why the crocodile isn't trying to eat the others is beyond me, but that's life in Maisy's world.Both of my daughters love the Maisy books; there's something about their simple stories and colorful pictures that even appeals to adults. The books are short and easy to read. But, the stories are never obnoxiously simplistic, like so many other books for small children.This is yet another fun sticker book for preschoolers featuring the always popular Maisy and her friends. You'll probably find that the stickers end up all over the place, often not anywhere near the inside of the book, but that's half the fun of these type books for kids. As always Maisy entertains small children over and over; they never seem to tire of her colroful, short stories."
4,A needed insight on human-wraeththu relations,"Victoria Copus' contribution to wraeththu mythos is a poignant, psychologically sound insight on the relations between hara and humans. Terzah is the consort of the supervisor of a refugee camp,Zen where human and hara experiment the difficulties and attritions of living togheter as a community. Terzah comes from the fierce tribe of Kheops, and his prejudiced view of humans will be changed after the dramatic death of an human friend, whose children he'll choose to adopt. The description of Zen and Terzah's human/harish family vicissitudes is very interesting, and at times touching. Only fault the introduction of too many characters, bot human and harish, makes following the story a bit difficult. but it's worth it!"
4,Basic but good,these workouts take you back tot he basics but use bands (in one) instead of hand weights. When I do them I will add some cardio after - just to feel like I got in a full workout.
2,They need a Swann song for their pathetic brackets,"I'm drawing more attention to the prior comments on the brackets. I've been using the camera in a Phoenix summer and it's picture for the price is better than the other sub $100 night visions I've tested but the bracket is not only ineptly designed it's dangerous to your investment. The camera's come off twice once from the clamp on the ball slipping and the camera ""headbutted"" the door beneath it .. cracked lens. It's fatally flawed without making you own bracket hence the 2 stars, would be 4 other wise."
1,SWANN MAXI DAY NIGHT,"INITIALLY THESE CAMERAS WORK WELL. BUT EVENTUALLY, THE LEDS START GOING BAD, ONCE THEY GO BAD YOU LOSE NIGHT VISION. I TRIED GETTING THE REPLACEMENT LEDS OR THE LED BOARDS FROM SWANN, BUT THEY WERE UNWILLING TO ASSIST. I WILL NEVER BUY SWANN PRODUCTS AGAIN. I OWN 14 SWANN MAXI DAY NIGHT AND 2 DVRS."
2,Go with the Swann Bulldog Camera,"This camera has a good picture but easily gets blown out by too much light. Additionally the stand cannot support the weight of the camera and hood so it constantly needs re-adjusted. Swann makes a nice camera but this one falls short. The camera you want is Swann Bulldog camera, we have 3 of those and this one only has slightly better performance in both night and day conditions, but the stand holds the camera in place (trust me its a big problem on this camera), and they are cheaper."
3,Mounting Bracket is useless,The mounting bracket is not what is shown on the picture and it is useless. You can tighten it as much as you can and the camera will still slip and slide. I had to modify and add an extra bracket so as the camera was stationary. Otherwise the camera works fine.
1,Very disappointing,"Although it says, napkin dispenser with napkins. I got only 2 plies of napkins. That's right. It was only 2 pieces: one for each side of the dispenser."
4,On your side,"'On your side' is wonderful and seductive, an album of bittersweet ballads both fragile and brave.Magnet aka Evan Johanson from Scotland via Norway has taken Jeff Buckley's majestic musings and sprinkled them like glitter with the splendour of Mercury Rev - the result is fragile and momentous without being melodramatic.This fragile soul wastes no time in coming to the surface with the opening track's 'Everything's perfect' line of (""You said you'll die for me/So why can't you live for me?"")The Bob Dylan cover 'Lay Lady Lay' with Gemma Hayes provides a mid album anthem and the rest washes over with a haunting magnificent ease."
1,Doesn't fit what its listed for,"Bought this for a 00 Camry and when I was ready to put it on. It didn't even slide on half way and I ended up chipping some of the balancer trying to get it on.Went to Kragen/Oreilly and bought another brand that fit for about the same price. Pay a little more and avoid Dorman brand, now I'm stuck with a balancer that can't be used."
4,Very good book but don't think they trial tested all entries,"I think this is a very good resource to have for kids to look through for ideas. I tried one of the experiments with my daughter and we had a lot of trouble getting the results we were supposed to get. It sounded easier than it actually was, plus the author didn't warn you about problems that could arise in doing the experiment."
3,Conclusion: Not what expected,"This book does cover the basic elements and design of a good science fair project. However, I feel that the quality of projects included are a bit overrated and perhaps outdated.My suggestion is to buy a newer version and check it out before giving up your money. (I bought this from a school book order form~~what a disappointment!)"
4,best exercise for upper body - get addicted,"Pullups - chinups - maybe THE best compound exercise ever for the upper body.Great for your biceps (palms facing you - easier) and upper back --- great for forearms AND biceps AND all back (palms facing away - harder ).Make sure you warm up first - don't want to tear shoulder/back muscles.Do four sets each way - minimum 2x/week - maximum 3x/week (heck, if you're 'young' do them every other day)Bar is strong enough to hold me @ `200lbs no problems - corner fit means it doesn't take much room - keep doing them until you get addicted !!!!!"
3,a few insights for the non-christian,"The polite game of chess review, described the book very well, and I do agree I wish they had kept the original order. But I would also like to point out that I was intrigued by a few points Brother Steindl-Rast had on Christian theology. Since reading it I have been searching for other sources that would expand on the views he expressed. One that intrigued me is the idea that the crucifiction needs to be seen as more than just a legalistic transer (i.e. my blood for your sins). Many points he made I'd never before heard but they made sense (at least to me) but I was annoyed that he wasn't able to go more in depth. I was left wanting a book on theology by Brother David Steindl-Rast, I've read Listening Heart but he doesn't get into much theology, more philosophy. Of course he has other books, and other authors do exist, so hopefully, eventually I'll find what I'm looking for."
4,Its awesome to the untrained eye,It's cool. It's fits almost any where. However it's size is recommended for smaller hands usually kids and teens. Besides that it's awesome.
3,One big (small) problem,"I have the wired Microcon, which has exactly the same layout. It is well suited to my small hands, with one glaring exception--the Start/Pause button is situated immediately to the left of, and very close to, the D-pad. It's not so much an issue for games where the D-pad is used just for switching weapons and the like, but for any games such as fighting games that involve fast action on the D-pad, it is all too easy for your thumb to slip off and hit pause by accident."
4,"Nice product, works well with the Xbox","May not be suitable for people with big hands. Its just fine for us. FYI, you can't hook up a Live Headset to the controller. That can only be done on the receiver end that hooks up to the Xbox."
2,Cheap,"This is an ok replacement pad. Sometimes it gives me trouble connecting and I have to remove and replace the batteries, like a hard reset on the controller. Button reception is a little slow sometimes and can get you in trouble while playing quick scrolling shooters. But overall for the money and just occasional game play this controller will work."
4,good,"it is good, is small very well... this for my son of 6 years, has a good reach, bateria lasts much, the unico defect to my to understand... is simply that it does not vibrate as the original control of xbox.. removing that detail is very recommendable..."
1,Microcrap Wireless Controller,This item did not work correctly and had to be returned. I would not recommend it. If possible I would give zero stars.
2,would not recommend this controller,Bad product. The analog stick gets stuck after just 1 month of moderate use of the controller. The money is better spent on getting another wired controller S. Battery lasts LONG though.
4,The Surrogate,This was a gift for someone who is currently in prison and I haven't heard if he has read it or not.
1,Worked great at first.... but then,"I bought this because it was a good compromise; my husband wanted a rain-shower head, and I wanted the hand-held option.After fining tuning the intallation with teflon tape to stop the massive leak that occurred with installation, this shower head worked like a charm. However, we have now owned the shower head for 9 months and it is falling apart. It is cracked on the side and we receive almost no water pressure from the head. It is made of plastic and is pulling apart. We have had to tape the handle together to receive any water out of the head.There is a reason this is such a great price - my advice would be to invest a little more and you will not be shopping for a new shower head in 9 months!"
1,Bad Quality!,"Don't buy this! I regret that I didn't listen to the people who left feedbacks. The craftmanship for this item is very bad. Not only the product was made of cheap plastic, it was missing a screw too. I would not recomment this product."
2,Love pownpour but plastic holder keeps breaking,We love the downpour but the plastic holder keeps breaking. Purchased three already and the shower holder cracked again. If the holder was metal I would buy again.
1,"Duh...WaterPik, it's heavy","This 8"" showerhead is huge and heavy, so heavy that the mounting bracket can not hold it in an upright position. A pretty poor design by WaterPik."
3,much better out there,plastic is cheap and breaks easily.the part you place the handle into broke after 6 months.. we arent that rough on it either.the actual device seperated when it fell out of the broken clamp.also - it restricts water big time. we got a new one and were amazed at how strong the water pressure could be.go look elsewhere
4,Solid Album,From start to finish this is a solid fresman effort from Wilco. Clear are the country-esque influences of the band's past incarnation; Uncle Tueplo. The first four songs on the album are fast and fun before mellowing perhaps too much. Think of the current Wilco sound with a twang being driven by very solid song writing. I love it and I seem to grow fonder of the slower songs with each listen!
4,"Wilco's worst, but their first...","...and an indication of where they would go. Jeff Tweedy in these days was compared to the Paul McCartney of Uncle Tupelo, and in many ways, these songs reflect Paul's sincerity and catchy melodies.It leaves much to be desired in the production and the musical depth category, but what can you expect, it was Wilco's first album. It has a much stronger country twang flavor than any of their others, but I wouldn't let that stop you. It isn't cliche country. It's good, it's just not really great, like some of their more recent works. Pick up this one with Being There. It's a fun album, it's just not arty."
4,Exceedingly listenable,"I came to Wilco via the Billy Bragg/Wilco/Woody Guthrie Mermaid Avenue project. I have an off-and-on affection for Wilco, the off part being because I think on occasion they get so wrapped up in being musical craftsmen that they forget the average listener focuses quite a bit on the lyrics and emotion of the delivery. Given all that, I would say this is better than the double-album Being There, but not as good as Summerteeth in terms of blending all three things (music, emotion, message). The one song Stirrat sings ""It's Just That Simple"" is a sweet little song and ""Pick Up the Change"" is a brilliant comment on relationships. And you can't help but sing along to Passenger Side, a song about drinking and driving...kinda. (""You're going to make me spill my beer/If you don't learn how to steer""). You won't regret this purchase even if you don't wind up loving it."
3,My Lord You're Mean!,"Wilco's debut album is a relaxing, tuneful collection of Petty-infused country rock. Songs like ""Box Full of Letters"" and ""Should've Been in Love"" have an ease and flow that listeners of any genre will enjoy. But the real gem of the bunch is ""Casino Queen"", a drunken sleazefest I couldn't help but want more of. The guitar, lyrics, and attitude are all perfect. Wilco went on to new territory after AM, but it's one of the friendliest records you'll ever hear. Still, ""Casino Queen"" makes you painfully aware of the fact that no band out there today seems to enjoy wallowing in the gutter, the way the Stones or Guns N' Roses once did. It's high time somebody filled the gap."
4,Blueprint for Success,"Your first impression after hearing A.M is that this is a band with huge potential, a potential they went on to realise with the epic 'Being There' and the simply beautiful 'Summerteeth'. Jeff Tweedy has shown us all exactly what he is about. Since the split up of Uncle Tupelo Jeff has grown as a songwriter. Where Son Volt have had differential success since their excellent debut 'Trace', Wilco just keep getting better. A.M is a melting pot of Out and out rockers, mournful country ballads and pure genius. The stand out tracks are 'Shouldn't have to be this hard' and 'Box full of Letters'. The former a rocker that you will be humming for months to come, the latter is probably the most moving account of a break up ever told. The next album you buy, make sure it says Wilco on the cover and this one is a good place to start."
3,Wilco's debut barely scratches the surface,"A.M. is a great pop debut from former Uncle Tupelo co-leader Jeff Tweedy. Every song is worthwhile and indicates why Tweedy may have felt a little stifled within the Uncle Tupelo constraints. Knowing what fans know now, after the release of the bands following two albums, A.M. only hinted at what was to come. Along with The Jayhawks, Wilco is simply one of America's greatest bands"
5,Don't forget Brian,"Don't forget the second reason why this album is great. The lead guitar of Brian Henneman. On loan for this recording from The Bottle Rockets. The highly overlooked alt-country-whatever band from Festus,MO !"
5,The best of the post Uncle Tupelo era,"A.M. is simply the best of the Wilco/Son Volt collection to date. That's saying a lot when you consider how strong Trace and Wide Swing are, and Summer Teeth really breaks new ground for Wilco.This one just has the simplicity and raw beauty that the Uncle Tupelo records had. It's easy to see the contribution that Jeff Teedy made to the band. He was the McCartney to Farrar's Lennon. Together, they defined Americana music in the 90's. Apart, they still make fantastic music. Lucky for us, we get to double our pleasure."
2,not yankee hotel foxtrot,"i gave this album two stars not so much because it isn't any good, but because it isn't any good for Wilco. My problem is that I started my Wilco facination by listening to Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, which is probably one of the greatest albums of all time. A.M. sounds like a totally different group altogether. As a matter of fact, you probably won't understand Wilco's Country Alt Rock label until you listen to A.M. I'm not anti-country at all, but what Wilco has evolved into since this album came out sounds so much better. I would listen before you buy. If you're a fan of Wilco's current sound, you'll probably be disapointed with this."
1,New Wilco fans probably won't like it,"I've gotten into Wilco starting at the end and working my way back to the beginning. This album couldn't be farther from Yankee Hotel Foxtrot if it tried. I loved YHF and wanted to see more about this band, but was sorely disappointed to see they were making Hee-Haw-worthy country albums like ""AM"" before they figured out how to sound cool. Avoid unless you're a country music fan."
5,Much more than I ever expected,"I was introduced to Wilco through their album Being There. I then moved to YHF, and they became my favorite band. A.M. was the last album of their's that I bought, and when I first listened to it, I ignored it, and it went back in its case for quite awhile. I had added the songs to an mp3 playlist, and so I listened to it when I went to bed every night. After about a week, I began to appreciate the album. Every song is very different from each other song, and they all give a very distinct feel to the album, and by doing this, gives the album its own texture, different from each other album. It also helps to see the roots from which the Wilco we all know and love grew. A definite keeper."
4,in the beginning...,"alt-country at its best - with more that just a tip of the hatto the rolling stones. so many good moments on this record.""i must be high"", ""passenger side"", ""shouldn't be ashamed"", etc.simple yet catchy as hell - this is just the beginning..."
4,"Buy this, not Summerteeth","Like Son Volt, Wilco's debut remains its best album. A.M.'s highlights -- ""I Must Be High"" ""Casino Queen,"" and ""Boxful of Letters""--beat anything from their subsequent albums. Plus, the tasteful guitar here is infinitely preferable to the keyboard wanking that plagues Summerteeth."
5,Jericho brings it home !,"This series, though sci-fi, has a serious tone. With what we live through on a day to day basis, this lets us see what some feel may be a possible future. They characters are believable, and the stories seem possible.That said, its excellent TV. It's not over the top, and it keeps your mind wondering. I think it is well written, and well produced. The actors are awesome. Bring back more than 7 episodes!!"
4,Like the show,"Its becoming more like showtimes Jeremiah, which was an excellent serial. It remanins to be seen if the show can stick to the main story arc, or if it will slow down to focus on the supporting stories. So far, its been a slow, but interesting ride.The ending of season one I thought was spot on. A nice direction to take the story in."
5,I Love this show,"I absolutely love this show. If you just download the pilot, you WILL be hooked. I only checked it out with passing interest but now I am anxiously awaiting the 7 new episodes."
1,DRM=DUMB,"Series is great! DRM delivery & viewing system is just plain stupid. If I watched it live (and suffered through all the commercials), AND recorded it on my DVR, it's mine and I'll do with it what I want. But with DRM added, it's just about useless. I'd even prefer to download a DRM free version with commercials. Wanna hook a friend on Jericho? Just burn 'em a 25 cent DVD (with commercials) & let 'em watch it when & where they want. Let them share the DVD too. Next week they'll tune in & watch (WITH COMMERCIALS). Doesn't that make more sense????"
4,Recorded stage show,Fun. Several artists in a stage show with the San Antonio symphony. Nice music with strings in the background.
5,My Heroes have always been Cowboys,"What a great idea, combining the San Antonio Symphony with Murph, the still powerful voice of Herb Jeffries (one of Murph's heroes), and other wonderful translators of the cowboy/vaquero music world. This native Texan was instantly homesick.Even if you hate country music, give this one a listen. Why? Because it is NOT COUNTRY -- IT'S WESTERN MUSIC.Thanks, Murph, for keeping our cowboy music heritage alive in such a beautiful way."
4,Classic Michael Martin Murphey,This is one of two CDs I bought after learning that MMM is the New Mexico state troubador. I grew up there and listening to these songs in his very laid-back style really takes me back to my childhood. The CD is excellent.
2,Weak audio-great music,"This CD could have been a great musical piece except the audio is terrible. There are portions of this CD that are clearly inaudable. This was, I'm sure, a fantastic live performance representing the cowboy and indian theme. It is too bad the recording didn't do justice to the performance."
4,Just a Beginning...,Interesting and informative book. I plan to buy some more from the same author as the various topics are fascinating and clearly illustrated.
5,Excellent reference media!,"Trying to remember a TV show you watched as a child? If so this is the book for you. This is my 3rd edition; the other two are at work and at Mom's. With cable and dish, more people of all ages are able to experience Classic television from all eras. Try it; you'll like it!"
5,great guide,"It is the best place to find out all the TV shows, Very good reviews and also great for any puzzlers for answers"
5,Great book,Great book for those interested in tv shows(USA TV especially).For some of the shows listed ther is indicated the total number of episodes and for others is not.It would have been great if it were mentioned the creator and executive producer of the shows.
1,Out of date!,Buyer beware! Don't make the same mistake we did when we ordered this as a Christmas present this past Christmas. 1947-present means....2007! This book was published in 2007 and appears to never have been updated! Amazon took the return but dinged us some because the gift recipient didn't look at the book until 30 days passed Christmas -- past the full refund limit. Don't really know why Amazon sells this book without a huge disclaimer that 1947-present was seven years ago.
5,9th Edition is coming out 10/16/2007,I think I've owned every edition of this book since 1978. It's been a staple in my library for years. It's a fantastic resource for tons of burning TV trivia questions. Looking forward to the new 9th edition in October 2007. Should be interesting to see the updates. Excellent book idea.
5,Excellent Resource for Pop Culture Fiends,"This is the third edition that I've bought (the others have been passed on to friends as trivia crazy as I am). The names of the Mr Kotter's students? The title of an obscure show from the 60s about a young man who ""dropped in"" on college classes because he was too poor to afford tuition? The name of the actor thqt played Aeolus on Hercules?... It's in there and so much more."
5,Prime Time TV/Cable Directory,"This is an outstanding guide for TV lovers. We have a growing DVD collection of old TV programs from the '50's, '60's, '70's, and '80's. The directory is very well organized and formatted to easily find other programs your favorite stars appeared in. It is also fun to look-up the year-by-year programming schedule to see when your favorite TV shows were on, and what other programs you would be watching.The descriptions are well written and chock full of interesting trivia and information about the shows and stars. You'll find in informative and FUN!"
5,Complete TV bible. **********,"The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows is the best TV book that I have found. This is the best, and I mean the best complete TV book on the market. I have purchased every edition for the last 20 years. This book has it all, and more. It has every TV shows from prime time television. I'm so happy to see the new updated version at Amazon. Amazon has a great price on this. Barnes and Noble was much higher for this book. Trust you can't go wrong with this book. I love it. I just wish the new versions would come out every year. I'd give this book more than 5 stars if I could. A very happy TV addict."
5,The ultimate TV information book,"I use this book on an on-going basis. It is full of facinating information. The book is updated around every three years. It's been almost four years since the last edition, so we should be getting an update soon. I've been circling Barnes and Noble waiting for the new one to come out. It is truly an indespensible part of my library."
1,Its not the product,"i dont know what happened but i bought the gloves that i saw in the picture but i dont receive the same.....im really disapointedValeo All Purpose Wrist Wrap Glove, Medium"
5,A great album,Gregory left too soon. I would have loved a few more albums like this one. Great voice and great songs. A classic and a must-have.
5,Exactly what you need for your Treo 750,It's confusing looking for a replacement stylus for a Treo - there are many different types. These came three to a pack with two different heads to screw on (one type for another Treo product and one for the 750). They are very high quality and also include pens in the stylus. They are also much cheaper than you find elsewhere.
5,Awesome!!! Great!!!,"the sound is very, very good, I bought 2. They work fine. For that price it is worth. If you don't wana buy Ipod 30G then this one here is a very good choice. The sound quality is comparable of Ipod 30G."
4,earphone,Can someone tell me the actual earphone line length? It seems too short in the graph! I have ordered one but have not got it.
2,Meh...,It does have some very homerous elements in the game.It did make me laugh out loud a few times. But other than that it is very boring.1. You run through a set path shooting enemies2. The cool weapons have limited ammo3.It is over the top hard for a simple game4. the graphics are terribleIf anyhting rent it to see the jokes then don't waste you money
4,One of the funniest games I ever played,"I've been a longtime fan of this game. I remember renting it once several years ago, but not being able to finish before returning it so I decided it was time to actually own it. It's still one of, if not the funniest game I've ever played. It definitely has its faults but it's features more than make up for it.Pros:+HILARIOUS!+Solid shooter+Great weapons (Shark Gun is a weapon you'll never forget)+Voice acting is great+Challenging gameplayCons:-Not too much replay value-Doesn't seem to have the highest production quality-AI is a bit unbalanced (sometimes enemies are like fish in a barrel, other times they're Vasily Zaitsev. Also, trying to get teammates to pickup health is a hassle)-Sometimes seems a bit too difficult"
4,Monty python meets halo!,"This game was awesome, sure it got repetitve at times, but I liked blowing stuff up along with the outrageous weapons, the land shark gun was hilarious. I think it was pretty original, I rented it, but if someone asked me about buying it, I would say yes also, because I am sure the online stuff is fun as well. I rented for 7 days and was addicted to it. Intense action, again, I am not an expert gamer, I like games that get to the action quick, the in-between scenes were hilarious!"
1,nice try,"The approach with this film is ""Airplane"" meets Women in Prison movies, with a heart. The leads are a little old for this kind of stuff and gags aren't that funny buy you could do worse. If you must, rent it, otherwise you will probably be disappointed"
1,Goofy... but worthless... Please stay away from it for your own good,"This movie is goofy funny, but goofy to the point of being idiotic. There is nudity but nowhere near enough. I really disliked this movie because it does not make it as a comedy, and much less as an explotaintion movie. The box cover is a major deception. The only redemable quality in it is Rhonda Shear who I still find attractive and wished that they would had shown more of her especially in the shower scenes. Do yourself a favor, and please stay away from this movie. It is certainly not worth your money or time if you are looking for an explotaition movie or comedy."
1,If ya hate nudity don't see this,I was told that this film was not Porn but a Light R rating or whatever so I did buy a copy so I could watch it for myself.I did watch it and the Shower scenes have some Nudity in it so if you hate Nudity then please don't see this film.I destroyed my copy already since I can't send it back cause I opened it already and I was not gonna dare sell this to anyone else.
1,Terrible!,"I'm sticking with Vilene. Sulky Super Solvy isn't good for freestanding lace at all. In spite of a new needle and proper tension it got holes in it and created a tangled mess under the plate. I hope I have better luck using it on t-shirts or towels, if not then it's a total waste. The one star I gave it is for the hope I have that I can use it in other ways."
1,Madonna,This book should be read if you are a scholar in religions. Could not understand most of what was written.
4,Covers Everything.,"I gave this book to my brother, but looking through it, it seemed to cover pretty much everything. It's not the easiest to follow (format-wise) but there is a lot of information there."
3,guide to records,"The book was very informative about history of records. I was looking for something that would help me with pricing, unfortunately this book did not help."
2,official price guide to records,The book didn't include but one of several hundred older records i had.
5,Collectors Evaluation,"Having primary interests in local records, I was amazed to find such a thorough job of research by Jerry. The midwest produced many fine records from many fabulous musicians. Though most have never hit charts or made the bigtime, Jerry has uncovered information I didn't have and, once discovered, found quite helpful. I have checked out several record books and have found Jerry's the most thorough and helpful. Keep up the good work and keep the historical info coming."
4,It is an excellent basic price guide,"It is the handiest book of its kind that I have read. It does have its drawbacks, but then no book is perfect. I wish that it (or some book) would cover the myriads of compilation albums (the K-tel classics, for instance) out there. Still, for your basic top 100 stuff, this book has no equal."
3,distraction,"I received this video a few days ago. Please know that this review has nothing to do with the exercise. It may be a great exercise video but I haven't been able to do the video longer than 5-10 minutes. When she turns and you see the rear view there is this white on black stitching that is extremely distracting. The stitching is in the front (vaginal) area and the rear (butt) area. I don't usually care what the fashion choices are in a video but the I'm thinking 'yuck' the entire time. I know my words sounds prudish (which I am not) but it's just my opinion. Hopefully, everyone else won't be so distracted that they can follow along with what is possible a good exercise video."
5,Perfect fit!,"Fits most Oster products. Was a perfect 1 to 1 replacement after some pieces from our original glass canister broke. And at the price, very low risk of wasting money. Want to be a savvy investor? Buy cheap spare parts. Better to have 'em when you need 'em; than to to be stuck without 'em and when you need 'em most."
4,ANOTHER GREAT GUITARIST,"I have now bought 5 J.P. BOURELLY CD's in short order and no 2 are alike. This one is a bit patchy due to the use of some RAP and other HIP / HOP elements. I hate RAP - HIP / HOP and had to deduct at least a star from an otherwise execellent guitar CD. When JPB sticks to FUNK / BLUES / JAZZ it is almost a revelation. He combines many alien elements and melds them into a cohesive total. His tone and stylings are all his own ( despite the similarities with HENDRIX ) and illustrate the unorthodox musical approach JPB takes. HEAVY FUNK with a heavy HENDRIX flavour best decribes the style. If that appeals to you, than you should buy this mans musik."
5,awesome,"i got these for my boyfriend who is a huge buffalo fan and he is really sensitive to sunlight. he loves these glasses, they look great on him and are just the right tint."
4,Classic Bluegrass,"The album goes back to the old days when Bluegrass was really pure and simple. It features mostly recordings by the most prominent acts of the early days, Bill Monroe, Flatt & Scruggs and the Stanley Brothers, a good compilation for those who want a CD with early and influential bluegrass music in their collection.I found the title of the CD somehow strange and misleading, though. This record does not feature the banjo more prominently than all the other instruments, there are some instrumental tracks on the CD but it is NOT a banjo album!"
4,More Pickwickian adventures,"Collection of short stories tied by the fact that they were told during the sessions of Mr. Humphrey's Clock Club. The narrators are Mr. Humphrey himself, Johnny, Redburn, Mr. Miles, Mr. Pickwick and the Deaf Gentleman. Following the line of the ""Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club"", these tales are less outrageous and more humanistic, full of nostalgia and good humor. One good thing is that the Wellers and Mr. Pickwick reappear."
5,Kick Ass,"This is a great game!!! I had hours of fun with this game! The system is great too. Trust me, this is one kick ass game!!!"
4,AWESOME!,"This game is EXTREMELY FUN to play!! I'm more of a kinda person that plays mostly Racing, Battle, Multiplayer, Dance Dance Revolution games.... and this is one game that's using your VOICE which is WICKED AWESOME! Only downside to this game is that there's not many songs to choose from HOWEVER, they are going to be EXPANSIONS!!! can't wait for those.... my friends and i play it so much that our throat hurts so much when we wake up in the morning but that doesn't stop us from playing!"
4,THY BEST!,"Me and my number best friend loves this,I know all the tips,but Iamnot telling.I do not have it yet.So,I will getit in June.I went tomy friends house to play it.She said,I can have the guide.Youneed to get close to the stage,because you have CDs in your hand.Give them to the crowd,you got yourself 9,000 more outfits!I dohave it!Got you!More Tips At...Iam never never never telling you!"
4,FUN FUN FUN!,"I got this game a few days ago with the headset and it's so fun! Most of the songs I knew, and that's quite a feet! I'm not having big problems with the headset like those people who said IT BROKE THE FIRST DAY! But honestly, you have to be careful with it. Just put it back in the box when you're done! There were a few problems I had with it, like I'm not that comfortable to sing in front of people, and some of the songs I don't like to sing, but that's my problem, right? So, RECOMMENDED!"
1,Way Overpriced!,"Target sells these for a third of the cost. Amazon's prices can be hard to beat, but these independents can be a little nuts."
5,LOVE IT!!!,this is a wonderful piggy bank and i love it i also love that it was cheaper than any other store I've seen it at
1,Allergy Reactions,Don't know what the manufacturer kept in the thick lining or in the plastic for the viewing window. This product has been giving us severe headaches and watery eyes even when we were just airing it out for a few days before use. Beware of asthema-like symptoms once you receive it and stand close to it. We had not had any prior experience as such with a few other stroller rain covers. Had to return it. Too bad the plastic smell is so strong.
5,If you are a walker/runner year round this is a must!,"I live in Western Pennsylvania and have a Rhodesian Ridgeback that I take daily on walks/runs. My son is a year and a half and loves his daily walks/runs as well. This is an expensive item, but if you walk or run daily it is well worth it. I did read the reviews and was a little nervous about the zippers. I do notice that my one zipper will get off track, but it is easily put back on track to keep my son shielded from the weather. My son also refuses to wear gloves. We went hiking this weekend with the temperature at 25 degrees and were out for over an hour. With no gloves his hands were still as warm as if he was sitting in the house. I also do not have to cover him with blankets. I bring the stroller in the house from the garage about a half hour before I'm ready to go hiking to warm it up a little and then I go. It comes with very little directions, but if you have common sense it is easy to put on your stroller."
4,Compact Yet Comprehensive,"This guide was invaluable during my first birding trip to Australia. Although I've birded for a number of years, Australian birds have almost no overlap with American birds, so virtually everyone of the 215 species I saw were new. The guide helped me quickly identify birds in the field. A few birds are listed in more than one place, which I first thought was an error, then I realized it wasn't and actually helped a lot when a bird could easily fit into more than one category."
2,Many wasted calls!,"Most of the calls on this album were a waste of time.Anyone could have called people and made funny noises.All of their comic story telling has diminished,and frankly this one made jerky boys 4 seem like a winner,when in fact it wasn't."
3,"It's not fresh, but it's still hot..","Where else will you hear anything like this? It's almost like hearing from an old roomate; You don't have as much to say, but it's still good to hear from 'em. Sure some of the calls sound staged, they have since the 3rd release, but just the possibility of the calls being real make them funny. This is one of my guilty little pleasures, and as much as my wife may hate it, I continue to buy, and laugh at, these phone calls. It's like a burger under a heat lamp. It may not be fresh, but it is still hot!"
1,This one is TERRIBLE!,"They're first 3 albums were so funny my stomach would ache listening but this one is crap. One or two decent calls that really don't even make you laugh hard but they're funny. It sounds like some of these are staged and aren't real calls too. They're living off of their name with this one, don't waste your money!"
2,Lacking Intuition,"After I heard the album a few times, I noticed that the Boys had hardly anything to say (unprepared) and it seems that improv ruled, which hurt, because the whole schtick is to tell some bull story which will alone make the listener laugh, and the predator has to have the know-how, communication skills, and comedic talent to successfully pull it off. Kamal and Jack Tor S losing their cool made me twitch my eyebrow. The endings were chopped off a good 5 calls, which was the final straw, and they could have saved space for the ECD and the endings if they took out the 2 Rosine calls. I absolutely know that the next album will be a winner. Get Jerky Boys 4 until that time comes."
1,I am the biggest fan ever!..but this one SUCKS!,From Jerky Boys 1 through 4 they have made me laugh so hard I was unable to concentrate at work..I think I know all the lines word-for-word!..I was so excited to hear this CD came out..I got it right away and was sorry to say there are only about three good calls. They need to go back and review their old material!
4,New Life,"People complain that the Jerky Boys have run out of ideas and that the people catch on to the prank about halfway through many of the calls. That is true, but I think that is what makes this one of the most interesting & hilarious collections since the original album. No, they are no longer fooling people as much, but it adds a new dynamic with the prankees knowing they are being screwed with and the Boys actually get more inventive just trying to make them laugh. It gives them a direct audience to respond to and they actually get funnier as a result. It's a different kind of prank call album that runs dry in parts but is fresher & funnier than their last two releases."
1,That Joke Isn't Funny Anymore,"The first two Jerky Boys albums were unlike anything I had ever heard. Sure, prank calling has been around since Graham Bell told Watson ""Ha! You believed I really needed you! Get back in your office, ya tool!"". But the Jerky Boys gave it a special touch. Filthy, extreme, and unbelievable, they still somehow managed to draw people into their trap even after making a movie introducing the whole world to their characters. (Of course, no one watched the movie, so I guess that's not that amazing.)But they've simply run out of ideas and have worn out their welcome. This album is the best evidence yet of that fact. Prank calling is the best example of a type of humor best in small doses, and the Jerky Boys are past the Recommended Daily Allowance."
1,not funny,There is no imaginative effort or creativity on this tape. The characters are not likeable. The dialog is disjointed. It's just not funny. What happened?
3,Shooting par boys...,"Funnier than Jerky Boys 3 & 4, but not as funny as the 1 & 2. All and all, I keep playing them all over and over and still laugh!"
3,Their latest is not the greatest!,"I am a BIG TIME fan of the Jerky Boys, I own all of their CD's. This one is probably their worst. It's still got some funny stuff but it's also more annoying than their usual act."
1,so sad!!!!!,You know that piece of bubblegum that you've chewed in class for the full 30 min. This CD is it. To the JBs--You can only milk it for so long guys!!!!
2,The Jig Is Up,"People are on to them. They've run out of ideas, and most of the time people are well aware they are being pranked."
2,gradual decline,"At this point the JB's are getting by on name alone, because their material has fallen off noticeably. If this effort had been their first release rather than their fifth release I doubt they would have made much of an impact back in 1993. I can't blame them for wanting to continue to cash in, but if they can't put much energy into their new material maybe they should consider releasing the remaining bootleg recordings from the early 90's which have not yet appeared on any of their official releases. I have one of those Jerkey Boys bootleg tapes and it is so filled with raw energy and inspiration it's hard to beleive it was done by the same two guys who put out SSAM. Maybe listening to and releasing the old stuff will remind them what they are capable of, or at least inspire them try a little harder. So c'mon guys, at least go down fighting!"
5,More moments for the time capsule...,"Your cheeks (on your face, I mean) will ache after listening to this CD. Among the best calls are ""Special Delivery"", ""Willie the Jackass"" (in which ""Rizzo"" wants to wear a ""silly"" Jackass suit in a ""family park"" (Disney) and drag the ""ass side"" of the suit behind him because ""the back leg's a cripple""), ""Tarbash's Cab Trouble"" (""I not drive CAB! "") and ""Send a Salami"". At least 10 of the calls are hilarious."
5,"""A lot of funky sh>t was goin' on, ya know?""","Just one of many fine quotes from JERKY BOYS 4, which was the last one I bought. I havent heard ""STOP STARING"" yet but the Jerkys have never really let me down. I heard many negative comments on the 4th record as well but its not that bad, in fact, mostly halarious. The Jerky Boys have a funny way of growing on you. Oh yeah some of the phone calls are obviously ""staged"" but it doesent make them less funny. My theory is that some calls are real and some fake but its like sketch comedy that way. I actually recognized a voice from an outgoing call on the first album again on an incoming one on the 4th. Its still all very funny and completely original. Im glad the Jerky boys havent quit making records and I suggest you hear this one for yourself. Okay, sizzle chest! - You do that!"
3,Could do Better Boys!,"Every time I buy a new JB album I am always disappointed. I compare it with the previous CD's and it never seems to have the same oomph! The more I listen the to new CD the better it becomes however as the nuances and anticipation of the catchphrases (I crack up every time Sol says ""You're a filthy women""). It's 2 months since I bought this though and even though there are a couple of classic Sol calls (we spent a weekend in Dublin, Ireland asking people to send a salami to the boy in the army)ultimately the CD was dissapointing. Why do they try and get Frank involved in dialogue when his best skits are the 1 minute abuse calls like 'Fava Beans' and ""Acupuncture', why does Tarbash not make any caberet act calls (his cab calls are usually poor with the exception of JB1), why is Jack relegated to only one call in which he's not even that bitchy!!C'mon guys get back on track and give your fans what they want!"
5,JERKY BOYS RULE!!!!!,"I am a big jerky boys fan and i have all their earlier albums.After i heard that their new album Stop Staring At Me was out,I just had to buy it.Jerky Boys always make me laugh with their prank calls and I will never get tired of listening to them over and over again."
5,Keep'm Comin Jerky!,"The Jerky Boys made me laugh my socks off again. This stuff never gets old, as childish pranks with the phone are classic. These guys are the best and I recommend anything they've made for your personal collection"
1,Finally Hitting The Bottom,"Most Jerkys' fans thought that things couldn't get any worse than the fourth album, but sadly, they did. This is as low as crank-calling gets, and it's obvious that the Jerkys had lost all of their inspiration at this point. This is a couple of tired, bored guys pumping out a product to make a few more bucks.Just look at Sol Rosenberg, once the greatest character in prank-calling comedy. Some of his tracks on the album - 'Masturbation Box' and 'Send A Salami' especially - are excruciatingly stupid and unfunny. It's a real shame. The Jerkys were once clever punks; now they're vulgar and predictable, spewing juvenile potty humor. And what's with the '1,000 Chickens Trlogy?' None of the three parts is funny by itself, and it's less funny as a whole. Once Sol starts talking about having sex with the chickens, you'll shake your head and wonder where Brennan's clever and bizarre sense of humor went.Avoid at all costs."
3,I'll run through walls for you,This is The Jerky Boys fifth album. It is somewhat of a disappointment. The material isn't as fresh as it once was. There are only a handful of really funny calls here. Only a few of the bits here are really memorable. Recommended for the boys' hardcore fans only.
2,The Boys on auto-pilot.,"This is what you guys came up with! I knew it couldn't last but if these guys don't stop (excuse the pun) phoning in their performances I just might have to do somethin' silly and stop buying their CD's. What is this stuff? The Boys used to be artists; the way they used English language was avant garde and refreshing. Now they do caricatures of their characters, who were only novel vessels which to screw around with people in the first place. The jewel of the bunch here is ""Willy the Jackass"" Now that's some funny s**t. The guys have lost their edge. Pranksters mourn."
1,Overdone,"The other person is right this record is weak but, it still might sell. Their are too many loops on the songs and it just seems to weigh down a slim song anyhow. And it sounds a lot like Natalie Imbuglia(I hope I spelled that right)"
1,No more,"From what I've seen of Bijou in interviews, at clubs, etc. she is a spoiled brat and a vile human being. And, if possible, her ""music"" is even worse. Her voice is thin and out of tune. To see a no-talent girl like Bijou get a record contract convinces me of the unfairness of the world. Other people say to buy this album despite her because her backing musicians are good. Well then why, oh why did they choose to hook their star to hers?"
1,Do not make the mistake of buying this CD!,"I did, and I had to sell it. Bijou has a lightweight voice that is grating and has a bratty tone. There is nothing new here. Plus, she does not even have songs that follow the female rock trend of Alanis and Tori without sounding like a phony. The lyrics are often hokey. She may be pretty, but that can't make an album good."
4,"Solid songs, Great guitar!","Say what you will about Bijou's mediocre voice (I don't disagree), but the backing musicians make this a good album. Kudos to the especially talented songwriter/guitarist Dave Bassett. I expect to hear a lot more from him in the future."
3,"Good CD, needs work with voice","Bijou definitely does well trying to plant her feet in musical ground. Songs like ""I Own You"" and ""I Never Shot The President"" remind me of oldies melodies combined with a hard rock sound. She does nicely with the R&B sounding songs, with some having beautiful hooks. Most lyrically interesting is ""Mermaid And The Earthman."" Her voice sounds fine, but a little baby-like. It has room to mature. Her voice is the reason for only 3 stars."
3,Indifferent,"She mixes two dimensions of music together to make a new style, that sounds amazingly like some past stars, it all depends on what you like."
1,I'd Rather Listen to Breaking Glass,"This is such a joke- I'm sure she's had a hard life bedding famous dudes but, I really don't care."
3,Take it or leave it.,"I have a tendency to buy cheap CDs on a whim and that's why I bought this one. Sometimes my intuition is good (Sinead Lohan, Jump Little Children), sometimes I'm way off (Lili Haydn), and sometimes the CDs are okay, as is the case with Bijou Phillips. I enjoy the songs ""Hawaii"" and ""When I hated him."" Those are basically the only two songs I am concentrating on since I also have a tendency to stick with what I like. Bijou's half-sister Mackenzie Phillips sings back up vocals on the two songs I mentioned and if you listen closely you can hear her much stronger voice in the background, which just makes me wonder why she doesn't have a recording contract instead. I'm not saying Bijou is a great or horrible singer/songwriter, but this recording is just so-so in my opinion."
3,Mislead,I was led to believe by a magazine(Maxim or Details) that this was a Bjork or Moa type recording. What I got was some above average pop. Like tasting water when you expect sprite not pleasant. But if you like mainstream Imbruglia or Alanis you will probably like it. I gave it to my girlfriend. If you like this buy Alana davis it is better and not so blantantly commercial.
1,Dull,"Phillips' voice is thin and she tries her best ti imatate natalie Imbrulglia. The compositions even with the help of proffesional musicans is dull and utterly generic. I suppose it's not that difficult to get a recording contract when you inherit such lineage but, it makes for good PR."
3,Mark's Review,"I would recommend this book to some who loves baseball because this book has a lot of it.This book is about a boy named Stan who is competing for a spot on second base against Gary Newman. Gary is very good but so is Stan. In the beginning of the season, Stan was horrible and Gary was hot! After a while Stan kicked it into gear after he got a mysterious letter that said,"" u can do it. Don't quit"".Stan took his place at second base and moved Gary shortstop. The team ended the season with a record of 8 wins 7 loses. Stan finally found out who was sending him the secret letters. It was his sister Dottie and her boy friend Jeff. Stan's brother Phil became a major league baseball player for Newport. Stan was so proud.I liked this story because it was about baseball and fighting for a position. That is what I do a lot."
4,Same old Same old,"For the first time flyers it may seem like a dream, but for the veterans of FS, it really isn't much but new ATC commands, better clouds and newer aircraft. Just as FS 2000 died out when FS 2002 was introduced, so will FS 2002 die out with the coming of FS 2004.Although the game doesn't boast anything new, I would still buy this just so I can keep flying online with my buddies. Overall, nothing new, and the price is too high."
1,Well...,"Well, the game's graphics are ok, but I think that the creators could have used satellite imaging to make real buildings. Outside of the big cities the buildings are the same. And there is no storyline or objectives, so if you want to be bored for half an hour, play this game."
1,fs2004,its great although microsoft has came along way but fs2004 hasnt shown improvement. only the atc and the addition of aircrafts are improved. i was a beta tester for fs2004. I will only buy this product beacuse i want to keep flying with pilots and soon fs2002 will die out like fs2000 once fs2002 came out..:| spend your money on something else |:.
2,Marginally better the FS2K2,"I resisted purchasing this latest release until I read a few months of reviews. As has been stated by a few others, if you do not own FS2K2 go ahead and purchase this. For someone who is using FS2K2 with addon aircraft, scenery, etc, this is not such a sure thing. Most improvements are in scenery and clouds, ATC is also somewhat improved. A tricked out FS2K2 does just about the same. Microsoft did not put much effort into this latest upgrade IMHO. I would expect the next version to be the big push, and it might be worth waiting for that version. After I installed Century of Flight, I found myself still using FS2K2 using my addons. So buyer beware if you already are an experienced flight simmer."
2,What is a great PC....what's really needed PC or programing?,"Microsoft states the system requirments on the package (are these wrong?)(450mhz,1.8GB HD,Windows 2000/XP etc.) After buying 2004, I find it slow and troublesome. On a 1.8Ghz P4, 256 RAM 40GB HD, it should run like a dream. I am really suprised at the poor quality and graphics. The selection of planes is good, but my comuputer has locked up twice since loading 2004. I have Combat Flight Sim 2 and it is great. I went looking for Combat Sim 3 and found 2004, I may try to take it back, for a swap out....yep its'that bad.Microsoft updated the package after about a year the preformance issues were almost eliminated, You need a good graphics card too, the built in is just not good enough. happy with it in 2006."
2,Will not run on some video cards.,I have a toshiba laptop with a nvidea 5200go chip in it. this game will not draw the 2d aircraft panels on the 3d display. Microsoft has identified it and suggests that you go to nvidea's web site to download new drivers. On their site they say that drivers are not availible for the 5200go chip you have to go to toshiba. toshiba says that it is a third party problem and I would have to go to Microsoft. and around and around we go. I had good help from microsoft online but they could not fix the problem. I ended up taking the game back for a refund. I still run 2002 proffesional and it is excellent. this is not a game but a flight sim. therefore if you have a 7 second attention span this game is not for you.
3,"""As Real as it Gets"", huh?","The simulator part is very accurate, or at least I think it is, because I know almost nothing about airplanes or flight, but the graphics are nothing like the box. Probably becuase you do have to download the new textures. It is very complicated for kids. On my system (XP) increasing the resolution messes up the menus. Also on this system, mountains and other scenery garble and blink. But, the plane models and cockpits are very realistic, and so are the clouds. Very in-depth, but sometimes difficult lessons. Overall, I suggest buying this game if you plan on taking some time to learn it (if you're new to flight sims)."
3,it can be better.,"I enjoy the Flight Simulator to much, But when I can go to Multiplayer Sesión, have problems, else if you like to flight ""on Line"", with VATSIM, I have problems, for the other hand, de ATC, is ok, and the scenary and Whethers is much better."
2,Disappointing,"I was expecting more from a game as hyped up and expensive as this one. If you like MS FS, buy the older version and save the money. It is flat out rediculous that you cannot crash a plane in this game. Even a 747 at full throttle will do a loop without damage or crashing. Absolutely unrealistic. A joke !!! You can land a jet plane going 500 mph on any surface. It will just bounce off the surface until it come to a stand still, you also can take it off from there. Material obstacles are none......you just fly through them. I expect from a good flight simulator that doing the wrong thing and putting the plane ""outside the envelope"" has real consequences for the game i.e. you crash or damage the plane. Also it is disappointing how ""buggy"" the game still is...flickering screen and vanishing text and picures when scrolling. This game is not what I would expect from MS. Selling mine after only one day........."
1,Treats the customer as a thief!!!,This is the only piece of software I've seen that requires loading a specific CD *each* time you run the program. That is a serious defect---all the worse because it is clearly done with malice aforethought. Program CDs are normally kept in a safe place to avoid being damaged as well as the more serious problem of cluttering up my computer station. The MSFS folks need to get a clue!I may well send this product back for a refund.
2,Bugs A-Plenty & Not Much New,"There is not a lot that I can say that hasn't already been stated by other reviewers. I've made the mistake of buying MS software fresh off of new releases and swore I would never do it again, due to glitches, bugs, lock-ups, etc... that were not caught in the 35 minutes of Beta testing done prior to release. I'm really upset with myself that I did it again. While anxious for what was a highly anticipated Flight Simulator, I ended up disappointed by the apparently lacking quality control put into the finished product. I agree with the other reviewers who said to wait for 3 to 6 months before buying; hopefully by then the patches will have corrected some problems. I encountered just too many to list in the space provided. Two stars for trying to emulate historic aircraft experiences."
3,Surprise,"I was flying a precision approach to Latrobe (KLBE) and to my surprise there was no airport. All the nav-aids worked fine, but there were no structural facilities. Apparently game was shipped with a corrupted BGL File. Uninstalled and reinstalled with no good results."
2,Installation is Louzy,The installation was terrible. The instructions on the screan and in the hand out were terrible. Microsoft should be ashamed to put something like that out. It is a real mess.It looks like it will be a good sim but the installation was dam near impossible.
1,"love the game, but...","game did not come in the ""tin"" as shown, would not have ordered it from here if I had known that the ""tin"" was missing!!!!"
5,Replacement,"Well just to let you guys know, you won't be getting the tin box version (you guys should really change this picture).I got it as a replacement for my current FS2004 since the disks were so scratched up, this worked perfectly."
1,Do Not Expect To Get The Colllectors Tin Box,the program MSFS 2004 is outstanding and i highly recommend it to anyone who wants a first class flight simulator Program. I am a real Life pilot and i appreciate the realism. MY BEEF is with the fact that despite the photo of the collectors Box and the $63 price tag what you get is sold on the same page for $20.97 you get the product in cardboard Box and pay a $40.00 surcharge for what you think is the collectors box save your self $40.00 and buy the one shown in cardboard box
1,Same old graphics,"There are not only fans who play these games to learn how to fly a plane, but there are also many people who just want to enjoy the scenery as they fly from country to country. That said, don't bother wasting your money if you already have FS2002. The graphics look almost the same as FS2002. As usual looking down at the terrain from a high altitude is great. On the other hand, once you come down to a lower altitude you can't tell if it's a field or a brown block. Sounds like they've used the same old programmers from FS2002 into 2004. Microsoft needs better programmers so we can appreciate the scenery at low altitude. They should also add farms and houses on mountains. It is completely desolate in the game with no lights at night. What happened to the Amazon rain forest in Brazil? It looks like a brown block with twigs sticking out. I can't see Microsoft making a giant leap, with regards to graphics, into FS2006. I'm going to have to wait for FS2008."
2,FS 2004 too slow,When I apply the display settings I use in FS2002 in this new version the aircraft flies almost 4 times slower.
1,product failed,"I installed this in a solar pool pump system, it lasted less than a month. It ruptured. I purchsed another at Home Depot for $4.00"
4,It spends lots of time helping u understand,It has helped me get beg. tumbling skills . I think this movie is GREA
3,Fun read but total (...),"Bruce was arrested by N. Ireland police and charged with ""obstructing police"" after they investigated his claims and foundabsolutly no evidence to support them. But give him credit, he wrote a great yarn. Shame on all you left wing, anti gov. types that fell for it."
3,Enjoyable - but totally Fiction,"Being an avid reader of many an SAS book I have to admit that that this book gripped me from start to finish. Why only 3 stars then? Well, I dont believe for one minute that this was a true story and is nothing more than fictional action! A great read nonetheless, this books grips you from beginning to end - how true it is of life in N.Ireland I coudn't say, but if you like a good SAS fictional action read then you'll enjoy this - but if you're looking for a book to add to your collection of SAS masterpeices, then i'm afraid you should give it a miss."
4,A good read.....,"A good reads if u r not looking for Steven Segal / Navy Seals rubbish. I believe that it is factual and it would be a very nieve reader who refused to acknowledge that the British Army are any less capable of such awful acts as the enemy. However, the author does seem to protest his innocence in the dealings a little too much. None the less a good read...recommended!"
5,Sounds good,Good quality and great price for a school band player. Students were happy with the price and quality of the product.
5,life-changing,"If you read this with an open mind you can see where you can help yourself improve your life!!! It's one of the BEST books I have ever read. I also read Seat of the Soul, which is a good beginning you don't need to have read that to benefit from this. But, it may help you understand this better. I have already felt a difference in my thoughts!"
1,Waste of Time. Poorly Written.,"My book group chose this book plus Heart of the Soul. Both were a huge disappointment, particularly with all the hype surrounding Zukav/Francis. I found both books barely readable. The editors should be ashamed - or there weren't any. The authors make huge jumps in logic (if there is any to be found), make up their own vocabulary and then mis-use it, toss 'spiritual' terms around freely without regard to common usage, and create a confusing mishmash of chapters that take the reader no where in particular. My recommendation is to avoid this book and its companion."
3,It's Hard to Argue with Simplicity,"Common sense says that if you act on something, think something or feel something then you own your experience. You are responsible for your choices and each choice has consequences. It's hard to argue with the simplicity of such an understanding but you would be shocked how many people miss the lesson. The authors go a long way to tell a short story but it's a story that needs to be retold ad infinitum. I can't say that I learned anything new but my history of reading such books probably surpasses this book's target audience. What seems basic knowledge to one person will be a well spoken revelation to another. In fact, I'm sure that 'Mind of the Soul' has the ability to affect needed change in those who are eager and ready to learn."
5,Soul seracher!,A great book for those who want to know more about themselves & grow by learning. An excellent book for those who like to know more & develop spritually. Highly recommend it!!
2,Mind Soul,"Again, was not shipped timely as expectedand was not pleased with the content...less than'I had expected. Disapponted.h"
2,usually well made,"I like this, the color is better than the picture. But after only about 3 weeks of use (not daily either) it hit the ground one day and popped! I am hoping it was just a defective one, but not sure."
4,Good product!,This is the same ball that my daughter's league v-ball team uses. She has been able to practice at home which has improved her game. It also came in her favorite color - pink - which is SO cool.
1,Poor quality,I can't believe that a company would knownigly ship a product that was defective. This ball was coming apart at almost every seam.
5,We loved it!!,We purchased the ball for our daughters 12th birthday. She has been on the park league playing volleyball and they had a few of these exact balls mixed in with some others and all the girls would run to get these balls to play with over the others because of the soft exterior. Our daughter couldn't be happier to have one of her own!!
4,Perfect for AAU U10,Ball arrived slightly soft but have pumped it up and is perfect now. Holding up VERY well through practice and even matches. Excellent quality overall!
3,Good enough for fine detail,"The tool is pretty useful for carving fine detail. Use it lightly, this is not used to hog out chunks of wood. Nice grip/feel on my hands, since I use two hands to control the tool."
4,Ultimate fun,"Let me get one thing clear before i start,I only gave the game a 4 because I'm sick of Tecmo not putting these games in english.When you're reading subs you're missing the action in the game.Even the characters from the U.S. speak japanese.One of the main reasons why I like DOA2 on PS2 was because the character voice acting was great and it added personality to the characters.Other than that, the game is perfect.The graphics are even better than DOA3, but don't look for a story.I highly recommend that anyone reading this review buy this game."
3,DOA 2 Hardcore,"I have the PS2 version of this game and I thought it was pretty good, not as good as Tekken but still good. What I really wanted to write was that the original DOA was released in the United States on PS1, I own it and it sucks by the way."
3,good,this is a good series to play. i played Dead or Alive 1 Ultimate and it was pretty awesome as usual.
3,Let down,"If you've played Dead or Alive 3,don't bother with this one,it's just a rehash.Should have stuck with volleyball."
3,Review,I ordered 2 books at the same time and this one took 8 days longer to get to me. Some of the pages were folded over from when it was put into the shipping envelope. The book itself wasn't quite what I was looking for but made for a fairly good read anyway.
5,Outstanding,I have always loved wolves and had watched the Sawtooth pack since they were first formed. Now the originals are all gone. The pictures in the book are magnificent and tells their story.
5,Great insight into Mozart's life,"This was an excellent read (I'm certainly glad I purchased it on a whim). The writing was detailed to an extent that I felt I was following the family around for Wolfgang's entire life. I've read most of his letters before, but this book nicely connects them together and gives more depth. And even after the account of his death, the story is still engaging. The section titled 'Mozart's Women' is particularly entrancing; the author's meticulous descriptions of his operas make one feel as if the author was right there during its premiere. I certainly recommend this to any Mozart fan."
5,Read this biography first,"If you are interested in learning about Mozart's life, read this biography first. I have read many, and this is the most interesting, the most delightful, the most easily accessible for both men and women. My only criticism is the title as it is misleading. The book is basically a general biography with an emphasis on Mozart's relationships with family, wife and close friends, but it also explores his music and his childhood. It also explores the years in the life of his wife and children after his death and explores the women characters of his operas. I cant recommend this book enough. Try reading this before you decide to plough through one of the larger, more dense biographies that you probably won't ever finish."
3,simple light hearted comedy,"Alvida Darling is a very simple light hearted comedy! Movie belongs totally to Bakul Thakkar and he was brilliant.Music is very nice and has a very rustic feeling to it! This is a family movie and definitely worth watching, at least once!"
3,Tidbits of Pleasure,"This book is filled with the most delicatable, sexy bits from several great books. It is fun and exciting to read. Perfect for those who want to skip right to the Naughty scenes. I would also recommend The Naughty Bits it is every bit as good if not better."
5,A Masterpiece,It isn't very often that you find a CD where the entire thing is just great but Chris Isaak's Forever Blue is. I can listen to this over and over and never get tired of it. Chris has the most incredible voice and the songs are really beautiful. Highly recommend it to anyone thinking of buying something by Chris. Buy this one and you will want them all.
5,Back to Basics,"There will be some sorry people who liked ""Wicked Game"" who will stumble into this album and be wondering wtf about two minutes into ""Baby Did A Bad Bad Thing."" Sorry, people. Supposedly a very bad breakup spurred this album, and you can pretty much tell right off the bat the Chris is pissed and more than a little broken up about it. ""Changed Your Mind"" is a perfect counterpoint to ""Nothing's Cahnged"" from ""Heart Shaped World."" Vert solid material throughout. One thing to note, guitarist James Calvin Wilsey, who shaped all previous albums to some degree, disapppeared mysteriously prior to this recording."
4,Certainly One of His Best,"First things first, yes I am a big Chris Isaak fan, no he is not anywhere near the likes of Roy Orbison, Buddy Holly, or Elvis. He is not a true original.That said, Chris Isaak's music grows on me. This guy plays meet and potatoes Rock and Roll with a superb singing voice. His songs are fairly simple but this simplicity makes them special.""Forever Blue"" has Isaak singing the heart-broken melodies once again. ""Baby Did A Bad Bad Thing"" is a very cool song with Chris singing low to the base line. If Elvis was alive today and released such songs as ""Somebody's Crying"", ""There She Goes"", or ""Don't Leave Me Walking on My Own"" people would be going nuts over these fine songs. Get a hold of this album if you enjoy Rock and Roll the way it was meant to be played: a couple of chords, a good beat, and a great voice."
5,The Gem of Isaak's Career,"Over the years, I have come to realize that Forever Blue is Chris Isaak's true claim to fame. Where ""Heart Shaped World"" delivered sporadic flickers of brilliance, this album offers a consistent thrust of great music, ranging from the heart wrenching rockabilly of ""Baby Did a Bad Bad Thing,"" ""Go Walking Down There"" and the rollicking ""Goin' Nowhere"" to the eerie whisper of ballads (an NOBODY does ballads like Isaak) like ""Graduation Day,"" Shadows In A Mirror"" and ""Don't Leave Me On My own."" This album is unique in that it is the perfect compliment to rainy days, but also a great soundtrack to a few long, sunny hours at the beach. Isaak dug up the prism of emotions within him and explored every color on this record. It is simply one hell of an album, and Isaak will have a nightmare of a time if he thinks that he can top it. At this point in his career, he can only explore and perfect different musical directions."
5,Chris the Crooner,"Chris Isaak has an incredible crooning voice and delivers it with a cool, iciness that really takes you away. When a song can make you stop whatever you're doing...stop thinking about whatever you're thinking about and just become absorbed in the song, then the artist has done a exceptional job. That's what the track ""Somebody's Crying"" does to me and it does it to me every time I hear it.Every track on this album is good. There is no filler material. But all of Chris' albums are good. You should get them all.His voice is incredible. His songs are cool and twangy. It takes you away...makes you daydream. I like that. To me, he's like a male version of kd lang."
5,Perfection.,"During the Summer of 1995, the number one thought in my mind was ""who could do such a thing to CHRIS ISAAK?""The unashamed emotion he expresses with both his lyrics and his vocals continues to impress me even after 5 years. There is not one contrived song on the whole album.Not only are all the songs genuine, they all perfectly fit into the theme of the album. (which if you don't already know is the devistation of a broken heart)Chris has a number of GREAT albums, but Forever Blue is truly a MASTERPIECE. The music, lyrics and vocals are all dead on perfect. You will not be disappointed."
1,Read before you buy and you most probably won't buy,"This book reminded me of a very intelligent and knowledgable physics teacher I had in high school who could not teach at all. Two PHDs and a JBuilder team member who cannot teach. Very difficult to read, I agree with other comments, a total waiste of time and money. Very theoretical with little substance. A better approach would have been to begin an application on Chapter 2 and finish it on the last chapter but instead, they chose theory throughout the book. I want my money back!!!"
2,little information beyond the tutorials included in JBuilder,"I am an experienced Java/Swing programmer who was new to JBuilder. I bought this book to help me understand both the database access issues and information on customizing the look and feel of JBCL controls. I was surprised to find the latter topic entirely absent. I found a few useful facts about database programming, and I enjoyed having a physical book to look at rather than the poor documentation browser in JBuilder. But only about 100 pages or so refer strictly to JBuilder, so after the first couple of weeks I stopped opening this book. This is the only JBuilder book I have looked at, my favorite Java reference is still the one by Gosling."
2,"Warning, don't expect to play this on a PC/MP3 player","Since it isn't noted by Amazon or any of the other reviewers:This CD uses the Cactus copy-control software, which makes it pretty difficult/impossible to play on most PC CD drives, some DVD players, and of course, if you can't rip it, you can't get it on your portable MP3/WMA player.Just want people to be aware of this before they order something and then have to return it."
4,Bloody Roar 4,"I love Bloody Roar 4. Battle format is similar to other 1-2 player fighting games, such as the Tekken and Soul Calibur series. But I don't mind that myself. A lot of blood use, almost a ridiculous amount, but I didn't mind that either."
5,Lovely!!,I love the first cd and love this one even more. Suddenly Tammy is a great band and I wish they would group back together and make more great music.
5,as good as advertise!,"obviously , they are not gonna tell you the bad things about a prodcut, only the good ones, in this case, the good ones are true, you can do all that is advertise here, with not that much of a computer demand, it's usb so it always have latency, ( a little delay since you play until you hear the procesed sound ) , but it's really really short, so... for practice, Jamming with you favorite mp3, or youtube video, it's great, the effects on it, are OK some really nice, and otherones kind of flat and cheap, if you can aford more, go for the guitar rig!I have the UX2 TONEPORT of line 6 and have serve me very while in a year and a half."
5,My son loved this costume!,"I purchased this costume for career day at my Son's school. We have been looking for a while for a complete, inexpensive, and fun chef costume for him, and this was it! The costume fit well and was true to size and it even came with a little oven mit that he loves. My Son wears it now every time he cooks with me and really enjoys it. The only down side to purchasing this product was the delivery time. I paid extra for it to be rushed and it did not arrive until 2 days after career day. It was supposed to be shipped in 2-3 days and took 5, but now we are prepared for next year's career day. :)"
3,Little Mermaid Watch,There's not much to say about this purchase other than I got what I paided for and it arrived in ample time and in fine condition.
2,Not worth the money...,"The Great Margarita book basically contains one (1) margarita recipe over and over again. The only thing that changes is the brand, type or blend of tequilas that are used in the recipe."
1,A One Recipe Book,"If all you want is one recipe for a margarita this is the book for you. It takes the same formula over and over (tequila, triple sec and lime juice) then varies the type of tequila and triple sec. What a waste of good paper. But it is printed well, great layout, nice photos and illustrations."
2,It's not a Great margarita book.,"Yes, the history of Maria's, tequila, and the margarita are interesting. Some of the ""tidbits"" are also interesting and useful. There's a foreward by Robert Redford to boot. But the fact still remains, this book consists of one basic recipe repeated again and again and again. And I don't buy the argument about the careful match of tequila to a liqueur. After reading the book, I couldn't shake the sneaking suspicion that I'd been had. If you're looking for some margarita recipes, search the internet and skip the book, I just don't believe it's worth the price."
1,Waste of paper,"I bought this book in preparation for a trip to Mexico. When the book showed up, I was very disappointed - it's basically the same recipe over and over again using different tequilas.Buy a book about Tequilas and experiment with the Tequilas that appeal to you using this formula; 1.25oz Tequila, 1oz citrus liquer of your choice and 1.5oz fresh squeezed lemo or lime juice. Repeat 75 times substituting various Terquilas and liquers and you will have replicated this book.Happy Margaritaville!"
1,Fair book; lousy service,"I just visited Maria's Restaurant, owned by Al Lucero, in Santa Fe, NM, and have never, in all my world travels, experienced such bad service as I did this evening. The waitor was horrid, rude and incompetent. The food was cold and dry, and the margarita was fair at best.This restaurant has a reputation for being wonderful. It is NOT! Don't waste your time visiting the restaurant, or buying the book. There is no information in the book that can't be found quite easily elsewhere, and after my experience with the author and his family restaurant, I will burn the first book I've ever burned in my long life."
2,A Disappointment,"If you want to learn about some different brands of tequila, this is okay, but you can get more and better information for free online. The margarita recipes are virtually identical. It's unbelievable that they have them printed over and over again, page after page, just with a different brand of tequila."
2,Drummer needs a better band,"Roy Mcdonald is one of many unlucky talented musicians. He has to rely on other peoples songs in order to be heard on record. Unfortunately, Kim Shattuck is a 3rd..............no I take that back, a 4th rate songwriter. Not an original thought in her head. And what a terrible singer. Roy, do yourself a favor, and find a better band. Remember, your only as strong as your weakest link..............and you, my friend, a playing with a broken chain. Two stars for the drummer."
5,Hooks from start to finish,"Down to a trio (Kim, Ronnie and the drummer), the songs are even better than on the debut (Jim DeRogatis' comments notwithstanding). As great a summertime, roll the windows down and sing along album as ever existed."
5,Carl Weber Delivers As Expected !!!!!!!!,Carl Weber does not disappoint in his newest novel PLAYER HATERS. This was a very entertaining read like all Weber's books. It grabs your attention from page one. One of my co-workers was reading this book with me and we were supposed to stop at page 150 and we were both finished by morning.LOL. I will not give away the plot because this is one book you have to get for your own stash.
5,Grabs you from the first chapter till the end!,"Carl Weber showed out! He really knows how to dramatize a story. I read this book in 2 days. I don't want to give the book away because this is the kind of book you don't want to know about so you can enjoy all of the surprises. Everything about the story was good. It is kind of about trouble in the lives of Wil, Trent, and Melanie who are all related. Its just drama, like in Baby Momma Drama. Carl has a hell of a mind. I love his writing style. Read it for yourself. You definitely won't be disappointed."
4,Hats off to Carl Weber,"I must say that I've been a huge Weber fan, since Married Men, and I remain one until this day. Player Haters was an hilarious tale of three family members dealing with life up's and down's. Trent sounds like a few men I've come across in my life, even in my own family. Wil was true to form, just like in Married Men, and Melanie finally got it right with Prince. I enjoyed reading the novel and would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for fun, entertaining, high-filled drama. I can't wait to read Preacher's Son. I hear that one is off the chain!"
5,"Once Again, Outstanding!!!","I read this one in one day, and I must say it is his best work yet! I loved Married Men, but this is my new favorite. My favorite part was the very end; what a twist! There has to be something else coming out about Trent because he's just too smooth. Thanks again Mr. Weber for a great read!"
5,Great followup,Great followup to Married Men. Read this in one night. Didn't get any sleep! Keep up the good work Carl. I will be reading every book that comes out.
4,Players beware!!!!!!,"This book was really good. It follows in the footsteps of ""Baby Momma Drama"". I would hate to think that there are really men out there like Trent, but if there are, ladies please hold on to your hearts!!! I must applaud Wil for being a ""good man""."
4,My Review,Player Haters was wild! The characters were unique in their own way but their friendship was priceless. Their destiny for love was crazy. Each character had their own way but they all found love in the end.
4,Carl Weber keeps me entertained.,This is an example of the thin line between love and hate we have all heard about. Carl Weber reminds us again that karma is no joke and what you do in the dark will always come to light. I enjoyed reading this book.
3,R U A Hater????,The book was good . It had my attetion.I could relate to the storie and even the people in the storie.I loved the twist at the end.
4,Another hit from Mr. Weber,"Just like his other books, this was a well-written book. If you haven't read any of his books, I suggest that you do. You won't be disappointed."
5,ANOTHER GREAT BOOK,"I MUST SAY! CARL WEBER COMES OUT STRONGER WITH EACH NOVEL HE WRITES.PLAYER HATERS WAS A GOOD BOOK A REAL PAGE TURNER,I FELL IN LOVE WITH HIS WORK WHEN HE WROTE"" LOOKIN 4 LUV"" I READ EVERY NOVEL HE`S EVER WROTE AND THEY ALL WHERE VERY GOOD IF YOU WANT A GOOD NOVEL PICK UP ANYTHING! BY CARL WEBER."
3,Was not that impressed,"I as not that impressed after waiting over a year for the book to come out. The expectation was that this book (Player Haters) was something if, not better than ?Married Men?.Although, it was a page-turner I was really disappointed."
1,UNBELIEVABLE,"First of all, I have read ALL of Carl's previous books (I hated to put them down) however, this book was predictable as knowing the last month of the year. I am very disappointed that this book came form Carl Webber. I hope his next book in up to speed again because his engine died with this one!!! Just terrible, I wish I could take it back for a refund."
1,UNBELIEVABLE,I have real ALL of Carl's previous books (I hated to put them down)but this one was by far the worst one. The book was predictable as the knowing the last month of the year. I am very disappointed in the book. His book that comes out next year hopefully it's up to his speed again b/c his engine died with this one. P.H. was terrible!!
1,Poor undergrad textbook,"Examples are poorly laid out in the text, and the questions seldom follow from what has been shown in the text. Not a useful learning tool at all."
3,Be Prepared,"This lab manual is great, however be prepared from a lot of confusing and problematic problems. Several answers are wrong and several of their versions of cross sections don't make any geologic sense. Some of the examples leave you questioning what to do next.It does have a lot of good information and is mostly easy to use. It helps you understand some concepts in your strucural class.The map is just silly and some of it is wrong. But, once you learn where the mistakes are you can work through them in the right way.Doesn't go over stereonets as well as I would have liked, but other than that, it was an ok lab manual.Pencil doesn't work so well on the pages, use pen."
5,I loved this book!,"What an awesome read! Silk, Lace and Videotape hooked me from the start. The characters absolutely come to life in this story - a hunky detective named Duke with stars on his tie - a glamourous heroine with a wonderful vulnerability from her days as an overwieght teen - a father who sings arias and guzzles coffee - and a flamboyant best friend who begs to have her story told in a sequel. All that AND a bang-up intrigue with lots of steam. Wow! Readers sure get their money's worth and more. WTG, Ms. Rock on another winner!"
4,nice looking,"looks good. only issue was that the size description and schematic slightly misrepresented the depth. So, the rear had to be cut open more to allow my receiver and its cables to fit properly. Not really a problem though since the back is easily cut."
2,Grow Up Already!,"Alright, it was sort of cute when she twelve, but now, at age eighteen, it's starting to get just a little old. Nikki Webster is Australia's Hilary Duff. Teenagers love to bash her and talk about how stupid she is, yet she still tops every chart with the release of every song. What's genuinely depressing is the fact that she actually has a decent voice, and could record some good tracks if her style matured. If I had to guess, I'd say that she's being told what to sing and perform by her managers and record label, and most likely has no control over anything she does. She has to, at least, be a little embarissed, I mean, if I was eighteen and singing this stuff I'd be positively mortified to be seen in public."
1,WORST ARTIST OF ALL TIME (or close enough to it),"Nikki Webster is an absolute JOKE of a singer. And what makes me sick is the fact that she has released a greatest hits album. To do this dont you first need a few hits?? She has had none. Her career has lasted a mere 4 years, and already releasing a greatest hits. She is 17 years old and still singing songs for 10 year olds, whats wrong with her?? She has a song called 'the monkey song.' People like Nikki Webster and her fans make me feel ashamed to be Australian. They deserve to be shot! (exceptions made for fans under the age of 12, they are yet to learn to think for themselves). I am not the only person to express these views of Nikki, Australia hates her, so dont hate us because of her."
5,wonderful cleanser!,"This is a soothing facial cleanser with a wonderful texture and scent. Not a big lather , more a creamy type and works well on my sensitive skin. Love this! I was glad to buy it in packs of two at a good price."
1,Not worth the money spent.,"I love Jenna but these were so completely boring!Not what I was expecting at all.I'd return it, but unfortunately I opened it."
2,"Screw is starting to fall off a lil bit,","D.J. Screw has been falling off his game in the past year. I don't know what it is but he isn't putting out as much underground music as he use to (could it be he has been blinded by success!) As a native Orange,Texan, I know more than most, And that's real. Stick to the underground TDK tapes cause this is garbage without freestyles from any of the S.U.C (Screwed Up Click)!!"
5,philip brooks - tatum texas,Screw n keke are the 2 best from tex n all thru the hood n metro-plex..dead end alliance 4 life south side showin up onthe blocks....
4,This game rocks!,This is my favorite video game by far.Its fun and a workout at the same time. It even keeps teack of how many calories you burn. If you have xbox live then you can battle people from all around.Thanks Konami for this great video game! What are u waiting for go out and buy it!
4,Amazing,this game is amazing! i have never had so much fun playing a video game until i played this game. it's outstanding. i absolutly love it
4,Dance on!,This was so cool! I got to try it in the store because it was on display. It's kind of confusing at first trying to select songs but after a while I got it. It's really fun to try to get the right steps! Get this!
4,Interracial Communication: At last the topic is addressed,"Finally, the Communication Studies field is addressing the important topic of interracial communication. Mark Orbe's book is an excellent introduction to this subject, particularly for undergraduate college courses. It includes a brief but comprehensive chapter on the history and construction of race as well as chapters on language, racial identities, interracial friendships, romantic relationships, interracial communication at the workplace and the impact of media. What's missing? I would like to see interracial conflicts and conflict resolution addressed in more detail. Otherwise, I highly recommend this book."
3,"by the numbers, but a pleasant diversion","I won't remember this movie in six months, but it's a pleasant way to spend a couple of hours. The conspiracy theory thriller is a genre that works, so if no new ground was covered here, at least what's here works. It's fun to see Dietrich Bader of Drew Carey and Whose Line Is It Anyway in a straight role, and Sherilyn Fenn acquits herself well. I'm not sorry I watched it."
2,"If Leo is a ""Whistling Virtuoso"", then what am I?","I was interested in this CD so I read the two reviews and I'm glad J. S. Ohmart ""fine"" put in his 2 cents as it helped me decide to not bother with anything by Leo Eide. I'm grateful Ohmart included the URL for the NAXOS MUSIC LIBRARY as I was able to hear Mr Eide whistle. Let me tell you, I know that there are a lot of good whistlers out there and Mr Eide should not be referred to nor should he refer to himself as a ""VIRTUOSO."" Blowing air through your lips does not a whistler make. An out of control vibrato makes a whistler unlistenable. He also happens to whistle with an annoying breath included in the whistling instead of a clean whistle sound as I produce. He sounds as if he was whistling through his teeth instead of just his lips. Mr Ohmart, with the money I just saved on not buying this CD, let me treat you to a cup of coffee! I'll whistle you a happy tune."
3,3 stars for its novelty.,"In all honesty, I was intrigued at the title. This guy can whistle like a bird, yes, but with his vibrato you can't tell what note he's whistling half the time. Also, once the whistling gets fast his intonation suffers. Don't buy this cd. If you want to hear it, go to http://www.naxosmusiclibrary.com/default.asp"
4,"Interesting, delicious, but very ""rich""","I bought this album for my internet radio stream, [...] and haven't regretted it! But, I wouldn't consider playing the full album in consecutive order. The music of Esquivel is reserved for desert.Esquivile took contemporary standards and really gave them an incredible (and distinctive) stereo effect, when you listen to it, you know who it is immediately.I've never heard anything like it, it is rich chocolate for your ears. Really good, but just as you wouldn't want a full meal of nothing but rich, dark chocolate, it can be difficult (for me anyway) to listen to the full album.Enjoy in moderation, but do enjoy!"
3,Its an ok good,"AFDS is a challenging game and is hard. in this game you do missions. Depending on the mission there is a 1-5 star rating 1 being the esiest , you can choose through 10 different piolets. This game is an arcade dogfighting simulation there is also a story that gose along with it. It has alot of planes including WW2 prop planes to mach 3 supersonic jets! it is a good buy if you like airplane simulations."
5,A powerful and disturbing thriller,"Janvier Tisi effectively carries the reader into the mind and life of a psychopathic killer with a good mission. This gripping and tragic insight into the land, its history and the characters that try to be heroic eventhough they are all victims is a suspense-filled thriller.I wonder if the president and his men have any real understanding of the system's purpose or goals.I know this work of fiction is based on terrible truths. Haunting and compelling though it is, I liked the moments of romance and the poetic presentation of Gavin's soft side."
3,This could be a Survivor Album,"This album was produced by Frankie Sullivan of Survivor. It went to cut-out soon after it was released. However it is a great melodic adventure, with 'Standing in the Line Of Fire' as the best song on the album."
5,Still Relevant,"I first read this book in 2001 and recently picked it up again. It is a sea of sanity in our insane material world. If our leadership had the capacity--and the curiosity--to learn from the essays in this book, we would all be the better for it. I have marked many ideas in this book with multi-color tags at the edge of the pages. The result is a rainbow of color. For those who have an interest in making the world a more livable place, this is your type of book."
4,An important book for high school forensics competitors.,"While perhaps not an essential book for the general reader, this book is an important resource for the many high school forensics competitors. It includes general information about how to present yourself, as well as specific chapters on each event. There are chapters on debate, student congress, oral interpretation, and public address. Unfortunately, no amount of reading about being a good speaker can make you one, but this book provides a helpful beginning"
2,Nothing New,"This is a difficult subject to find relevant, helpful information about. The book is serviceable. It provides the basics needed on the subject, but not the 'edge' we were looking for. Great as a rudimentary introduction to the field of forensics when little material is available. Still, I wish it went deeper."
1,Maybe good for first time high school coaches,I have competed and coached on the college level for over a decade now. This is very basic stuff that may help a new coach or first time student. It does not give much insight for an experienced person.
4,McFarlane's Evil Prophecy,"I purchaced McFarlane's Evil Prophecy not really knowing what to expect. I have always loved Konami games since way back in the days of the NES and Contra Castlevania & Blades of Steel, & i also love monster movies so i figured that i would give it a shot. The story mode is a lot of fun, its very similar to Gauntlet. You fight through levels with all 4 charactors. You can also switch between them in game. Each has a specific power , fire, Poison, Electricity & Guns. Each player has a normal attack & they also have a special attack and they also have an airal attack. I also like that the bosses are classic movie monsters wolfman, frankenstein, dracula, voodoo queen & the sea creature). The one problem I have with this game is that you cannot play multi player in the story mode. The multiplayer modes are played in a dungeon type area and you can play with or against the other players. I enjoyed it and i hope you will too"
4,More Fun then other reviews suggest,"I love hack & slash games! that being said, this is one of the standard hack & slashers out there with fairly bland graphics however if you are just in it for some cheap amusement with some cool graphics (todd's critters are pretty cool looking) nothing truly innovative here but it is fun and distracting. its also pretty violent and goly, which i enjoy. so its not a 5 star masterpiece like diablo 2 was but its pretty good for ps2 and for 10 bucks or less its worth a look.Graphics: bland on most things Beautiful bosses. 3 1/2 starsSound: avg. 3 starsfun factor: 4 1/2 stars. multiplayer modes with 1 to 4 players and the ability to attack your friends made this go up one more star for me.Overall rating therefore would be 3 1/2 to 3 3/4 but I was a little more generous since halves aren't in the rating system.3 to 4 star!McFarlane's Evil Prophecy"
5,"Excellent opportunity to integrate language, music and rhyme","Writer David Davis has converted rhyming prose into jazz music! His wonderful rhythmic text is full of ingenuity, invention, and inspiration. I love all these ""hip"" historical places in New Orleans, and what a wonderful introduction of jazz through these swingin', swayin', groovin', wailin', far-out JAZZ CATS! Fantastic illustrations too. A perfect book for homes, schools, and libraries, for adults and all cool kids!"
5,Awesome,"Great book. It exposes readers to the traditions and important customs when practicing Muay Thai, and includes great training information and techniques."
2,Alexander Macedonian from Russia?,"The book has no illustrations. The only pictures were the ones on the title page of each story. The Russian Cinderella story had a picture of Alexander Macedonian. He was an ancient Greek, not Russian, King."
1,RIP OFF,"Pack: ""A collection of items tied up or wrapped;"" this does not mean a singular plate. The whole set of these plates was $26.97 and an external website advertised on Amazon sells the plate for $5.99. How is the Amazon price $17.26? Something is wrong with this picture. This is the first negative experience I have had with Amazon"
5,A story written for our present time and world condition.,"I read this book by Joseph Girzone immediately after returning from my first trip to Israel. I was reading his first book ""Joshua"" on the way. And began ""Joshua and the Holy Land"" on the 12 hour flight back to the USA. What I really enjoyed about the story was the reality that was presented in the characters that encountered Joshua. I also appreciated greatly the accurate portrayal of the places that were involved in the story, especially the reference to the first place Joshua met offically with his group of followers: ""Seven Arches Hotel"". While on tour in Israel, our first hotel was Seven Arches. The story made the trip stay all the more alive in my mind.I also appreciated the hopeful message that Joseph Girzone leaves with his readers. It is a contageous message that hopefully can spread in real ways to the leaders of our world today."
5,an amazing book,"I read this book when I was 12, and I think I was too young for this book that point of time. The book was nevertheless interesting with really touching incidents shared inside. It taught me how to be a better person - I took such a long time to finish this book, and it was all worth the while. People should take the time to read it - don't rush it."
4,From the cover:,"Whole Language for Second Language Learners offers demonstrative proof that the key to the success of bilingual students lies within a whole language approach. The purpose of the book is threefold:1. To show why whole language is important for all learners, especially second language learners.2. To provide examples of teachers applying whole language across different grade levels and with students from a variety of linguistic and cultural backgrounds.3. To analyze from a whole language perspective traditional methods of teaching a second language.Each chapter contrasts a commonsense assumption about teaching second language students with whole language alternatives.Readers will gain an understanding of how to apply whole language in classrooms where some or all of the students speak English as another language."
5,Amazing photographer,"I love this book, and Michael Thompson is a great photographer. I always buy a magazine if i know he has a photo spread in it... really great"
5,this is what i needed all along,"this is the best i've ever seen in technique and detail , i see where i made a ton of mistake in the past thinking i could wrestle after watching this i found how little i really knew . thank God for this dvd"
2,a ship without a rudder is like a ship without a rudder.,"This game could be a whole lot better with rudder controls. If this game wishes to capture WWII combat it needs the barrel rolls and arial stunts, as it is the planes all the planes fly like rockets, not like hawks. Despite this major flaw, I like the target system, and the lanscapes are not bad. However for all around game play SWON should seek some advice from her bueatiful cousin Crimson Skies. Better dogfighting next time, secret weopons of the cold war? I'd love to fly a spyplane."
3,Neat idea,This is a decent game with decent graphics and sound etc. Flying games that I've played all seem to lack that certain thing. This one isn't much different. It makes a nice try and is a fair game. I would reccomend renting for now and pick it up when its under $20.
1,Buy Crimson Skies instead.....,"This game does not meet usual Lucasarts standards. This game would have been great about 10 years ago, but with todays technology it is way below standard. You fly these WWII planes, but the planes do not move around, it seems as if the screen is rotating around and the planes are stationary. The graphics are sub-par, and the controls are not that great. If you want a flying game buy Crimson Skies instead. The difference between those two are like night and day."
2,Just OK could have been so much better,"Rent this game first before you buy. I purchased and played all the way through and was greatly dissapointed. Nothing like the original Secret Weapons of the Luftwaffe not even close. If you play Crimson Skies then try this game you will know that this game is subpar by todays standards. I finished the game and sold as quickly as possible. The reason is i knew after playing this game it has terrible graphics and the missions are rediculously easy. This game price will drop when most find out how bad it really is, just wait and get your copy cheap but do yourself a huge favor and rent it first and only buy if you can get it cheaper than renting."
3,not as good as i could have been,"I got this game on friday and i beat it int 4 days. The missions in this game are nothing out of the normal. Destroy this, protect that. They had a wide variety of airplanes but in the end they all seemed the same. There wasn't any great difference between most of them. I bought this game looking for a game like Ace Combat 4 and it was nothing like it. It's sort of your twisted metal type of game but with airplanes. The graphcs aren't too shabby, but there not that great either. There was a couple of times where my airplane got stuck in the ground or it didn't respond at all. The most frustating thing is when you try to land your aircraft and it won't let you even thought your on the landing strip and you then crash. That really upset me. That happen quite often actually. As for the end of the game? it's like one of those movies that just end so they can create a sequel. But overall i would recommend playing it. It was fun all thing's considered"
4,Commies!?,"... ..Oh yes, the game. I have played an early build and is is very well done. The graphics are satisfactory at best, but the sound, mutiplay, and control easily make up for that. A rental for most, but if you are a fan of the old Secret-Weapons games or TIE Fighter, this is a must have."
4,Take a history class before they write a review!!!,"At what point during WWII did we fight the ""commies""? The answer is never. We were at war with, Germany, Italy,and Japan, none of which are ""commies"". We were allies with the Soviet Republic, or better known in some circles as the ""commies"".By the way the game looks really cool!"
2,Is it as good as SWOTL?,"I am a little wary that this new game is not up to standard obtained by the old DOS based SWOTL game. After devouring all the information the SWON website had ... I am left wondering if SWON has nearly the depth as SWOTL. Will I get to: Determine what technologies are researched, which engines are built, which air frames are manufactured? If this new game is just about flying and graphics...then we might be better off keeping our 486's alive and grabbing our SWOTL floppy disks."
2,whatever,"dumb game -good delivery-on time, just not what i was looking for in a flying game. surprised tat there are soo many games available"
1,Won't play on a Xbox360,"My dad loves this game, he plays it on a PC.... I have the Xbox version, but it won't play on a Xbox360!"
4,Very Scary.,"One of the scariest games I've ever played. The controls are a bit frustrating, but once you get use to them it's not bad."
4,To sum it up: Terrifyingly disturbing and Scary,"Many games try to be scary, but fail miserably........ Not this one. I am not going to get into the subject of what happens in this game, that is for you to find out. However, I will give you an advisory of what to expect. There are two things that parents may want to hear about before letting their children play.Scariness: Deeply Disturbing, and Scary Situations. Many pop-out at you suprises. If you have seen ""The Ring,"" get ready for a suprise.Violence: References and Scenes depicting a horrific ritual. Some graphic wounds.If you let your children play this game, keep close. This game is very scary."
4,Much better than the first,"This version is much better than the first one. The environment is much more clear and you can see the character's face better(the first one looked very blurry).The puzzles are a whole lot easier to solve, and you don't get really stuck on them much. I actually about to rated this game 5 star because it's really fun, but I rate it 4 star instead( becuase I'm stuck on the part where there's a ghost blocking the way and when it attack us, we will instantly die, and stone mirrors won't work. The size of the ghost is SOOOO big!!!) try it, it's fun!!! (p.s if you know how to get past the ghost, write me it!)"
5,great fatal frame story,"I am a huge fatal frame fan just for the fact its the only game that has even came close to scareing me . this games atmosphere and sound makes you uneasy and on edge along with its great cinamatics .but besides all that it scared two grown men and this is how ......Me and my friend cody were playin the game figurein out puzzles and everythin like every game we play , and we came to a part where we didnt know what to do and so i have the controler running around when i noticed a blue curtin hangin in the corner . so i went behind the curtin and couldnt see anythin except the curtin in 3rd person so i quickly went to 1st to see what was there(me and cody were at ease ) and right as i did it a little boy ghost smacked right in the center of the screen with great sound making cody get up , knock over his chair , and run out of the room while i threw the controler and jerked away hitting my head on my dresser..........this game is by far worth the money"
5,free peepee for your pants,A good survival horror game is hard to come by. Pants are common. I say it's worth soiling a few pair.
4,way better than original,"this game is the best. freakin' awesome and scary as hell too. get as soon as possible. it has great graphics, gameplay, and story. it's up for some awards on ign.com, be sure to vote for it."
3,"Not as good as the original, but decent non-the-less","I let a ""friend"" borrow this game some time ago and never saw it again. Some friend... I know. Now that they've reprinted the games I had the opportunity to buy a new copy for $30, so I jumped on it to complete my collection, once again. It's not as good as the original (my favorite survival horror game of all time with possible exception to Resident Evil Remake for Gamecube), but it's a decent survival horror game all in all. The difficulty was toned down for sure. The enemies come at you more methodically than in FF1. I think it was too easy."
3,Not as good as the first.,"Good overall game.Bad, bad horror game.It just is not scary. The music shifts gradually, so a random ghost never surprises you. The chase scenes are remedial at best.This doesn't stop it being a fun game, but truly the only way its superior to PZ1 is the graphics and the ending song!"
2,Frustrating,"I was excited to see a new survival horror series I could play. And after reading the reviews I had high expectations. I was sadly disappointed.This is the most frustrating game I have ever played. The characters movements are slow, which make its hard to beat the ghosts, and do not even think about 'running' away. It does have stunning graphics and interesting storyline. Unfortunately I stopped playing halfway thru because I just could not stand how slow things were."
5,A Warranty Of MANY Sleeplesnights.,"I have played Fatal Frame, the original, and it is one of the most SCARIEST games...EVER MADE. Now I have no idea how the first one was rated Teen, but this one, Fatal Frame 2, is Mature.Here's the basis of the game:Two twins follow crimson butterflys to a town that has been salvaged, rampages, wrecked, and is no abandoned. Ghosts, spirits and demons will try to kill them, but the girls are ready.Ready to be scared? Then buy this awesomly great and creepy game!Also recommended:Silent Hill 3Fatal Frame"
5,Keep the light on!,This is the first horror game that I've played and boy did it exceed my expectations. The graphics are excellent(scary) although a little dark and hard to see at times(scary) which definately adds to the thrill. The background noises(scary) and adrenalin pumping analog movement(scary) make this one SCARY game. I think I've made my point. The only drawback is not enough save points. I would have probably rated this for teen instead of mature. A++++
5,DO NOT PLAY AT NIGHT!!,"But of course this game is meant to be played at night, but who cares. All i can say is this game is SCARY!! The day i recieved this game, it was raining outside so i couldn't wait to play it in the dark. Good for horror/survival game fans but not for me. Many people with alot of experience with horror/survival games are use to these types of games but this is the first for me. To make a long story short, played till 4 in the morning and had to sleep with a night light on in order to sleep and still sleep with one on. I am paranoid because of this game but it was well worth it. So unless you want to sleep with a night light on and be paraniod forever, don't buy it, if you want to risk it then follow the crimson butterflies into the hellish abyss."
2,"Love Hall & Oates, hate this collection","Now dont get me wrong, I'm a big fan of Hall & Oates, but whoever the sound enginneer was on this album, should be fired.I'm big into sound quality car audio systems and have always enjoyed my hall and oates CD's as listening material. They've always really popped and sounded wonderful.Something about this album though just doesnt sound right. I know some of the songs are not the radio versions, but album versions, which Ive heard before. Most songs on this collection sound either flat with no vibrance, or completely uneven as you listen to the song. It's almost as if complete frequency ranges are missing. This is from listening back to back to the same track from different CDs.I wouldnt recommend this ""remastered"" collection to anybody. Buy a couple of the other greatest hits albums that are available for this great band."
3,Guilty Pleasure,"Hall and Oates were the blue eyed soul group of their era and this compilation doesn't fail at delivering. From tunes like ""I can't go for that "" to ""Wait for me"" to""Sarah"". they give us the kind of music that to be honest I haven"" heard on contemporary radio in decades. I highly recommend this CD to anybody who has ""Soul""."
2,Spare me...,"Please...enough of the ""remastered"" (i.e. rehashed) stuff. How about an UP-TO-DATE live album one of these days? I saw H & O last year in Atlanta at Chastain Park with Todd Rundgren, and that show was excellent! The song ""I can't go for that..."" was especially good...and the jam sessions were great. Why not capture some of that kind of stuff on a CD? Instead of the same ""remastered"" stuff over and over, why not put out something fresh and unexpected?"
1,Revisionist/biased,"This book was a disappointment and is shallow in the way it treats the Church's history. It deflates the Church's role as the guardian of moral values. It seems to have an underlying lack of Faith, as it implies errors in the Church's teachings. For a truthful and spiritually uplifting book, I recommend Triumph: The Power and the Glory of the Catholic Church (Paperback)by H. W. Crocker III."
1,"Neither Catholic, Nor Historical","From the historical-critical method of presenting the Bible, to the thinly veiled lashing of the Cardinals for following the guidance of the Holy Spirit and not the media, the author has a distinct penchant for recasting the beautiful flow of History according to the dictates of the cold, stagnant modern scientific Worldview.The only reason for purchasing this book wouuld be so that the next person won't be tempted to read this tripe. But then, that would just encourage both the publisher and the author to continue this title, and kill even more trees - and souls."
2,Author never heard of a liberal idea he didn't like,"This is a review of the new third edition, Jan 2004. From looking at reviews of the older edition, the author has kept his liberal viewpoint in the new sections. All liberal issues are good - all traditionalist views are no longer appropriate. He has added material up to 2003 including the sex scandals. Unfortunately for him as a liberal, he quotes from Archbishop Weakland who now has been discredited. He does have a good defense of Pius XII for his handling the Nazis and Jews. I didn't mind the first half of the book, in fact I enjoyed it. But I really got tired of the liberal voice always having the last say. Being a modernist, there are no absolutes, no dogmas, all is subject to change and change is good. Since the author is an elderly Pastor at a Cincinnati church, he has fallen into the Pastoral approach error that justifies all as long as it is done in a spirit of love and conscience. I can not recommend this book"
1,Disappointed,"I should have read the reviews before reading. The first quarter of the book was interesting enough for me to read, but as I read further, the author's liberal and political ideas came in to his writings more and more. If you want to get closer to the Catholic church, this is not the book for you."
4,Its tittle say it all!,"I'm in my first year of theology, and some of the cool things I've always wanted to study was about the Roman history. In his book,""A Concise History of the Catholic Church"" Bokenkotter includes all the details any religious or lay person should learn about his/her beliefs about God walking with his people. More specifically, how some group of people were willing to give up their own lives for bearing the name, Christian."
1,Bokenkotter's odd history,"Bokenkotter's history of the Church includes a curious, odd fascination with both the murderous Sandinistas of the 1980s and practitioners of the discredited liberation theology.** Readers interested in a more balanced and accurate history should seek Alan Schreck's ""Compact History of the Catholic Church"" or H.W. Crocker III's ""Triumph."""
3,Long and somewhat liberalized,"Go for ""Triumph: The Power and Glory of the Catholic Church"". It's much more fun to read and not nearly so dry. Bokenkotter writes like he doesn't want to offend anyone and defends those who would damage or change the true faith."
3,A popular (slanted) history of the Catholic Church,"The book tries to be 2 books in one. Firstly, it is a very impressive history of the formation of the papacy and it's struggle to communicate the faith to the rest of the world. The second book (if one could separate it out - and one can not) is a liberal catholic perspective on the past and a re-interpretation of history from the unique liberal catholic perspective. Read it, but with a skeptical eye and don't hastily accept the authors characterizations and conclusions without independently verifying them."
4,"the good, the bad, and the ugly","Not easy to put 2000 years under one cover. What I like about this work is that it is not afraid to report the less than christian conduct of the sons of the church. At the same time it does not ""bash"" the church. An excellent pocket reference."
1,Don't Waste Your Time or $$$,"I opened the book recently since I received it by mistake. This author thinks the problem with lack of priests is they are not allowed to be married and women should be allowed to be priests. Need I say more?Father John Hardon, S.J. who developed the catechism in use by the Missionaries of Charity before the Catholic Catechism was published recommended Church History by Fr. John Laux for solid history anyone may read which covers up to about 1944."
1,Scary,"I enjoyed the first part of the book, got leery around his presentation of the Reformation, and was tempted to put the book down outright after his history of the French Revolution. The last half of the book is more a political and social agenda than a history. Avoid."
4,"An open, non-defensive account","Bokenkotter reviews the issues and decisions of Catholic church history in a fair, non-defensive way. He gives balanced time to the losers in contests over orthodoxy, and doesn't assume the temporary victors are always right. In explaining the choice to ban families for priests in 1074, he honestly shows the arguments in play. The difficulties of controlling priest's wives showed no sign of going away, and the hierarchy's patience ran out. The great Gregorian reform for priestly chastity gathered force because the mainly monastic higher leadership realized how greatly marriage assimilated its clerics to Western women's values. (p. 141) The other defining moments in church history, from the codifying of orthodoxy under Constantine, the turn to holy war and persecution against infidels, the great ""counter-reformation"" revival of service vocations, or the conflicts over modernity, all receive an honest, open treatment.-author of Correcting Jesus"
2,Leans to the Left,"This book shall we say ""leans to the left"". This bias limits its usefulness. The interpretation of the facts of history and the facts you choose almost always show the authors agenda. I suggest Shrecks Compact History of the Catholic Church instead."
3,Through the Lens of Vatican II,"This book is a fairly comprehensive history of the Church over the last 2,000 years. However, Mr. Bokenkotter seems quite happy to gloss over many important events in the history of the Church to devote a great deal of time to the discussion of the liberalization of the Church over the last hundred or so years. Favorite liberal bishops and theologians are discussed ad nauseum. Clearly, following the mistake so many make, Bokenkotter is viewing 2,000 years of Church history through the prism of his own experience and his own prejudices. It's as if Vatican II, in his eyes, is practically a second coming. Then, as if watching his beautiful balloon fall to earth as the air slips out, Bokenkotter devotes a terse afterthought of a chapter to the death of John Paul II and subsequent election of Benedict XVI. He obviously views the election Ratzinger as a blow to the ""Spirit of Vatican II."""
5,gorgeous bossa nova,"I discovered this album in the late eighties, and it is unquestionably my favorite Brazilian album (I've listened to scores!). Zelia Barbosa sings protest songs of the late sixties written by folks like Edu Lobo, Ze Keti, and Carlow Lyra - nearly all of them great in their own right. Her voice is evocative, emotional, aching, sublime - and her singing is far more impactful than any Brazilian singer I've heard. The trio backing her - piano, bass, drums - is raw and very strong, as is the production. Nara Leao's better-known versions (she also recorded most of the songs here) are pale and pop by comparison. Sadly, I'm unaware of Barbosa having recorded anything else in this style, though something may be available in her own country. She recorded a handful of vocals with Quinteto Violado in the early 70s, doing Northeastern Brazilian folk music, which is radically different in feeling. As far as I know though this is a one-of-a-kind record. It's fantastic."
4,Gold Grandma Charm,Very nice as a mothers day present or birthday present. I would recommend you pair it with a nice charm bracelet.
2,Not So Great,"I was not to happy with this book I just couldn't connect with the characters, was a little disapointed with this book. I like Gerri Hills books but this was not my Favorite."
3,Good But Not Her Best,"Compared to her other works, Sierra City is rather bland. The characters are well drawn, but the story moves at a snail's pace and is very predictable. When one of the main charachters faces uncertain peril, there's no doubt in the reader's mind that there will be an easy reslolution. Perhaps that is was is lacking from this book. It is way too predictable and way too safe. For Geri Hill at her best, check out ""Hunter's Way"", ""Target"", ""The Killing Room"", ""Scorpion"" and ""The Artist's Dream"". They are worth five stars!"
2,Lesbians and Liquor,"Although the premise for this novel is a good one, I found the abundant mention of beer and wine in almost every social situation a bit off-setting. Why can't lesbians get together without downing a six-pack or two bottles of wine?It was also very predictable. I found myself skipping many pages of useless filler information.I've read better by Gerri Hill... she is becoming formulaic - like Karin Kallmaker."
3,For those who enjoy the occaisional Harlequin Romance...,"Do you remember Kung Fu: The Legend Continues? If you do and were a fan of the show, then you will be pleasantly surprised to know that Chris Potter plays the romantic leading man in this nice, if somewhat bland, love story.Basically, Potter plays a spy trying to protect his spy mentor's niece, and his mentor, from an evil spy that Potter and the uncle used to work with.Pretty much the standard manipulations and lies but the chemistry between Potter and the female lead is pretty good.Oh, and Paula Abdul makes an appearance playing the female lead's best friend.Espionage, romance, and two beautiful people. A nice way to wile away an hour or so."
1,"Terrible Movie, but hey, Paula Abdul's in it!","I have always heard nothing but terrible reviews of this movie, so when I decided to finally see for myself (and this was solely because I am a Paula fan and wanted to see her...*bad acting*) it was worse than expected. The film lagged and reminded me of Paula's last venture in acting. ""touched by evil"" anyone (one of ABC's worst made for TV movies in history).Bottem line: Not worth your precious time (unless you like Paula!)."
2,Atrocious grammar - hard to read,I purchased this book to fill out my .Net collection. This is (by far) one of the worst written/edited books I have ever read. The editor needs to take an English course. The content may be passable but if you are looking for anything more then a quick reference look elsewhere. Hopefully the great team at Apress will release their ASP.net book soon and fill the asp.net void.
3,Plenty of errors - ASP.copy&paste book,"I bought this book based on other reviews, I'm at page 200 and I have found more than 40 errors till now, either other readers are sleeping while reading or are family members. Examples are very basic, QuickStart samples that come with visual studio are more profound, at least there you have choice between C# and VB code examples.However, I was able to contact the author who helped me solve some of the ambiguities I had, particularly with state management."
3,"useful, but not a how-to reference","This book collects lots of information that is publically available from the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources and presents it in a concise, useful format. A brief description of tactics and flies begins the volume, but most of the space is taken up by tables of lakes. A better book for tactics is Fly-Fishing the North Country, (Perich)."
2,Not what I was expecting,"As a 34 year-old with multiple myeloma I was eager to read this book. There aren't many books on life experiences with myeloma, especially from someone in our younger age range. Also, I have recently had a stem cell transplant and chemo, I'm now looking for alternative therapies to keep a relapse from happening and was very curious to see how Michael's experience was. I was disappointed in this book.I didn't really like his style of written, to me it seemed choppy as he was jumping from one part of his life to another. I felt like he included irrelavent details just so some of his friends name's could be mentioned in the book. Not to mention all the poetry and literature he added... it wasn't what I was hoping to read about. Then the book just seemed to end abruptly... leaving me with many questions and much disappointment."
3,"Pretty and all plastic, but came chipped","I was super excited about my new cereal dispenser but was a little disappointed to see that it's all plastic, and not as sturdy as I thought it would be. To top it off, part of the top cover was chipped but I've gone through Amazon's return process and would rather not deal with them. At any rate, the dispenser is really pretty and very useful. I just wish it wasn't chipped :'("
3,It is okay.,I love the idea of this. I purchased it for my father for snacks. I was actually embarrassed after he opened it because it is made with very cheap parts. I do not expect it to last long. Would not purchase again.
4,Just a Neater Way!,"Great solution to many cereal boxes. I buy the bulk size from Costco and they are rather large for the pantry. This solves our problem with a sleek look for the counter top. Or, I might just put it on the shelf of the pantry. Either way is saves room and looks much better. Sometimes the cereal gets stuck in the rotating device before it gets distributed and you have to turn harder and crush the cereal piece thats in there. No big deal though."
2,The cereal smells like the rubber of the handle,"Looks sleek, it is practical but the cereal smells like the rubber that turns with the handle. I washed it 3, 4 , 5 times after soaking in water and vinegar, but still the smell of the rubber is strong. I also tried one of the container washing it just with detergent, still the same odor. I bought it in january but didn't return it hoping that with time and usage, it will eventually go away."
5,Love It,I love this dispenser. It helps keep all of the clutter of cereal boxes off of my refrigerator and out of my cabinets. My 1 year old loves to turn the knob to get the cereal out.
4,Great product,"Stylish, works well, and comes with sealing caps to keep food fresh. A great addition to the daycare. Good buy."
2,Cereal spitter,It seemed like it would be a great way to store cereal but it made more of a mess than it was worth. It spit cereal all over the place. I used Special K and Kashi granola cereal so it may work better if you used it to store something soft like oatmeal or gummy bears! I returned it.
1,container,"I did not care for the product, it was too high, did not fit under my counter, plus it arrived broken."
1,The Cereal Crusher,This dispenser is terrible. It will crush all your cereal. Mornings will be bad. Days will be ruined. All because this thing is terrible.
1,"I returend it to seller because Its shipping was more expensive than the product, and they didn't send me money back yet.","Customers please check your shipping fee before you purchase your product from ""Today's Concept"" from Amazon.com.They are very tricky and didn't accept coutomers' cancellation."
2,Disappointed,"I recently saw this item online and the reviews made it sound like it would be great. I added it to my bridal registry. When my dispenser arrived at my house BOTH canisters were cracked. The box had hardly any padding so I could see how they could easily break. Also, this double canister takes up a lot of space. Fortunately, I was able to return it for a credit."
4,Food Dispenser,"I ordered 2 of these and one was delivered intact and one had a cracked top. I think it should have been padded a bit better in the box. Otherwise, they work very well. We like them in my office for little cravings."
1,Zevro Dual Dry Food Dispenser,"Looks great, functions very poor for cold cereal. Every turn crushes dry cereal into ""dust"". Better use with flour, surgar, etc."
4,Nice functional Cereal Storage,"I have used this product only for storage of cereal so I can't say how it works with anything else and generally I'm pleased with the product. The cereal seems to stay relatively fresh, although I usually like to keep the black rubber cap on the bottom opening just in case. My only complaint is because the rubber paddles that push the cereal out are somewhat of a hard rubber it can crush the cereal a little bit creating more crumbs and sometimes be just slightly messy."
4,Great Product,"I got this so my kids would stop over serving themselves cereal (that they didn't finish) and then not close the bag up tightly enough to keep the unused cereal fresh. It works great! It also came in handy when I needed something to serve goldfish crackers at a birthday party. This way there wasn't little hands in and out, just clean servings! Worked great for that as well. Kids really enjoy how easy it is to use and the novelty of it."
4,The crumbler - useful gadget though,"As others have pointed out, this does crush bigger-sized cereal. I haven't tried modifying the wings yet but may look into that. It's made of sturdy-enough looking plastic so I hope it lasts. It's a godsend for those days when you're too tired or in too much of a hurry to cook breakfast for the little ones in time for school. I hated having to roll up and put away my Frosted Flakes back in the pantry to maintain the freshness, and this device helps although it does crush them. We may even buy other colors (we got black to match the kitchen appliances) just for variety."
3,Good for some cereals ...,"This dispenser is nice in that it keeps cereal fresh and crunchy - much better than an open bag rolled shut.However, as other reviewers have noted, it crumbles some cereals. It works fine with dense cereals like cheerios, any of the sugar puffs or small pebble size flakes. However, it does damage to bigger airier cereals like Crispex and Chex, crushing more than a few of the pieces. But that's only a big deal if you care about having whole pieces.Overall, I would recommend this if you're happy with the limitation and don't mind keeping the ""airy"" cereals in their boxes (or having them slightly crushed)."
4,"Good product, larger than I thought","This product is good, it is plastic throughout and very easy to assemble.It is much larger than I imagined and can hold more than a normal sized box of cereal.I have used it and am surprised at the bad reviews because I put cherios in one and reeses puffs in the other and all came out perfectly, no crushing or problem with turning the devise.Would definitely recommend."
3,"Cool concept, cheap materials","Our cereal dispensers arrived with one cracked and broken. The plastic containers holding the cereal are thin and not heavy-duty, which I was disappointed to discover. All in all, I think the concept is great, but we returned them."
1,I bought the last broken one on earth!,"Ordred Feb 25th, recieved a broken one soon after. I returned it right after and now its the middle of April and it is still not here. If you live in Wisconsin they are $15.99 at a pick n' save. I give up! I have bought several things from Amazon and still have yet to recieve them or find out shipping info. I have better things to do with my money. I will now shop somewhere else!!!!"
5,GREAT ITEM!,I ordered this for work since we have a continental breakfast and it works great! I have had it for about a month now and I haven't had any problems with the item! It is easy to clean and use and the price was great! Shipping was great too!
5,Great Gift for anyone,This was a great gift for my parents.They love cereal & it looks great sitting out on their cabinets.Dispenser hold a lot & is very reasonably priced !
5,Cereal dispenser,"We love this item, it's easy for the kids and everyone who visits asks us where we found them. They look cute in the kitchen too!"
2,Accident waiting to happen,"This product seemed like a good idea. I mix my own cereal, and add lots of nuts and seeds. So it is a lot heavier than the fruit loops that are always shown in the pictures. The way that the holder fits into the base is not at all secure, and when full of heavy cereal, disaster is assured. Also, neither the top or the bottom cover is a really secure seal, so tipping the holder caused the top to fly off for me, and some interesting times for my dogs cleaning up the floor. I had a hard time taking the bottom seal off when my cereal bowl was in position. If you take it off first, then some cereal leaks out, causing the problem I was trying to solve - namely no cereal laying around my counter inviting unwelcome guests.I tried this product for awhile, but threw it in the trash pretty fast. Went back to a big tupperware container Not as convenient as this could have been, but no awful spills either."
1,Dry Food Dispenser Review,"The idea was a good one, but the item did not function as I had hoped. It seemed to crush and spit out the food material everywhere. Each use brought a mess."
4,My kids loved Zevro Dual Food Dispenser,"I bought this dispenser for my kids' cereal. They don't like cereal, so I tried to get something to encourage them to eat. Then I got Zevro Dual cereal dispenser. It looked nice and looked durable. It's just a little big for my small kitchen, but it's OK as long as it's a nice display. The kids loved it and they are starting to eat cereal more frequently now. My sister liked it, too when she saw it."
1,Definitely not [...],"I bought two of these. I gave one as a gift. After 3 months of use, I am embarrassed I ever gave this junk as a gift. I use it for cereal and boy does turning the knob (gently) crush the cereal to sand. I thought this would be useful so my little ones could feed themselves a serving of cereal but this plastic junk is so not worth the money. [...]"
1,What a mess!,"I bought this for my wife last Christmas and have regretted it ever since. It's a very clever device for it's intended purpose except it's really messy. We use it for storing Cheerios and Raisin Bran, and I've seen it pinch out a Cheerio that bounces off the bowl bottom and skitters two feet across the counter. The rubber plugs which snap onto the bottom openings to keep food fresh are a pain to replace and often don't get put back on correctly; they eventually fall off. And what's the purpose of the chrome grill underneath which fills with crumbs and is difficult to clean?On the up side, it is kind of cool looking and would remain so if you didn't use it. Otherwise I would suggest getting almost any other kind of container for storing cereal. That's what drew me back here to Amazon. I'm looking for something else."
3,"Works, but less than ideal","This product works, but it is not by any means ideal. The two issues are that (a) the turn flaps that dispense the cereal tend to break up large or fragile cereals (e.g. Raisin Bran will become, on whole, more smaller flakes) and (b) it tends to spatter cereal everywhere BUT the bowl.So... it's not a BAD product, but I'd spend a few extra dollars and get one that has a cork-screw for dispensing the cereal instead of littler rubber flaps. I think you'll like the results better."
5,Kids are finally getting their own breakfast!,"We love this item! It has dispensed all kinds of cereals from large honeycomb to the tiny fruity pebbles. Each one has been a great success. I read some reviews that said the unit was unsturdy... NO WAY! As long as you make sure to snap all pieces in securely, this unit stands on its own from completely full to entirely empty. We have used it for well over a year with no problems! I would definitely buy it again!"
3,Vendor service outstanding - performance remains to be seen,The vendor was outstanding on this order. The first two filters arrived damaged and they were quick to send replacements at no charge. I purchased these because they appeared to be much easier to install as the filter box is pre-assembled and slides right into filter housing. That part was great. The question remains about performance because these have about half the number of pleats as the original media replacements and we will see how they perform with the reduced filter area.
2,OK at first,The idea is good but the crayon doesn't work if the side of the tub is wet. This makes for frustrated toddlers. My 3 yr old could figure out to draw on the rim instead of the sides but then it is hard to wash off. My 18 month old daughter bit the crayon part off so I had to remove it and put it out of use.
1,Tiny!!,Total waste!! Save your money!! This crayon star is so small it'll be gone after one use maybe two if we're REALLY lucky!!
2,"Lots of plastic, not much color","Disappointed that it's so much smaller than it looked and the center plastic part seems to be about 95% of the toy. Grandson likes it, but can't use it without getting the opposite color on his hand. Clever idea, but not well executed."
3,Much smaller,This is a very cool bath crayon however it is much smaller than pictured. It was a gift and after receiving it I felt the need to buy something else since this was so tiny. I was very disappointed in the size.
4,Tons of fun.,This product is fun for the kids! It does not come off the tub walls as easilyas I'd like though. Even adding a spong to the tub for the kids at bathtimeisn't enough... I still have to do some scrubbing. The purple color is the hardest to remove.
3,Smaller than anticipated,Thought u'd get more product for the price. Still a good fun toy though. Hoping it's going to be easy to remove from the bath tub.
3,"Overpriced, but my daughter loves it.","I still think that 5+ dollars is too much for this crayon, but, my daughter who will turn two in January, really likes it. It is easy for her to hold onto, it floats so she can easily find it and it writes under water too, which she really loves. My main complaint with this is that it does not easily wash off a tub surround. In the actual tub, it comes right off with a wet hand, but even after wiping it off the walls of the tub surround right after a bath time art session, it still doesn't completely come off, there are still light shadows of what once was on there. I use foaming bath cleaner to get it off completely. Not a big deal, but it's an extra step that I wouldn't mind doing without."
2,Old tub? Beware.,"So... I was just about to put my house on the market when I decided to top up my virtual cart with this bad boy for Super Saver Shipping.My three-year-old son went nuts with it -- wore his favorite colors down to nubs at the first bath. But the really fun part came after. While it wiped right off of the newer tile above the bath, it took 20 minutes of me and Soft Scrub to remove most traces of the revelry from the older tub itself.If you're dealing with an older fixture or porcelain that has some wear, I don't think you'll want to make this a part of the bathtime routine -- unless you also want to make your curse-ridden, hunched-over clean-up a part of the bathtime routine as well."
4,very small,From the photo I think I expected this item to be much bigger. It's very small but easy for my 2 year old to hold in his hand. He loves to color in the tub and clean up is fairly easy.
4,adorable,"The Crayon was alot smaller than I had expected, it probably measures 2 1/2"" long total. I presume that is my fault for not fully reading the details of the product. All-in-all, my daughter loves it and it fits well into her palm. Glad I bought it."
4,Great item but smaller than expected,The star crayon arrived quickly but I learned my lesson to read before I buy as it is much smaller than I expected.
4,"Doesn't melt in tub, but leaves ring around tub.","Pro: The crayon's don't get funky and dissipate in the water. Con's: 1) The crayon's leave the water a little murky 2) leaves a ring around the tub when it's dained 3) harder to clean off the tub walls than the other stick crayons.Overall, I think this is better than the Rub a Dub Draw In The Tub crayons as they last a lot longer and don't break into pieces. I just don't like the film/funk it leaves in in the tub."
3,"Kids love it, but it's messy!","These were great for my 2 kids, 4 and 2, because they each had their own and didn't have to fiddle with multiple crayons and fight over the colors. That said, they were harder to clean off the tile/bathtub/other toys, because the crayon is very thick and waxy. Worth it for the kids for their ease of use and fun factor, but more difficult to clean than other crayons we've had in the bath."
4,"Good product, poor delivery time...","I like the product. I read all the reviews, so I knew to expect something small. I think this is a fun bath crayon and I'm overall glad that I bought it. The reason why I gave 4/5 stars is due to the delivery time. I ordered this item on 11/8 and didn't receive it until 11/21. What's ironic is that with the item I received a piece of paper that states, ""Wow, that was Fast, huh? We've worked really hard to get this order to you QUICKLY and ACCURATELY!!"" and it continues on asking for feedback. I thought the note was quite humorous given that it took so long to be delivered. Overall, it was a good purchase.**Note: In all fairness, there are many reasons why it may have been delivered late, including the fact that it shipped from NY and there were delays due to Hurricane Sandy."
3,its soo small!,I was expecting much more from this. Thank god i only paid $4 for it. It is soo small! I havent used the item yet cause i bought it as a christmas gift. I hope it works well!
3,not what i expected,this is tiny!like the size of a half dollar! would be great if it were bigger but good product and the crayon doest wear to quickly
3,"I love this, but...","My major issue with this crayon is that once the colors are used up, there's no way to replace them so it becomes a throw-away expenditure.As for the actual product though, my son loved the fact that he has multiple colors to choose from. We use it a lot to draw all over the bathtub. From my perspective, it's great because it's easy to clean, sometimes with a little needed elbow grease...Overall a great product, except for the lack of refills."
5,Great for little hands,This is the best bath crayon product I have found. Cheaper than most of the others. The circular aspect of the holder makes it very easy for toddlers to use. The fact that all the crayons are on the same holder means less crayons to store or keep track of. The crayons write solidly on the bath tub and walls. Clean up is pretty easy. Just wipe the walls with a wet cloth (some rubbing needed) and then follow up with a surface cleaner spray and wipe down to remove any last debris.
2,Not what I expected,The crayon was a lot smaller then i had thought and you can purchase a whole set of tub crayons for half the cost.
5,Great bath crayon for little hands,"My 18-month old son loves this crayon in the bath. It is the perfect size for his little hands and he enjoys erasing his scribbles off the bathtub with the washcloth too. The colors are bright and vivid. Even the yellow shows up well enough, considering we have a white bathtub. This is a great product!"
2,"cool, but doesn't clean up well.","My daughter loves to doodle, so I figured this would be a fun thing for her to do in the tub. When I got it, I ripped it out of the packaging and gave it to her. She didn't know what to do with it, so we both got into the tub and started drawing on the walls. When we went to clean it up tho, some of the marks we made wouldn't even come up with a scrub brush. The crayons are very waxy, like real crayons. Wax repells water. I don't see any difference between using this and using a real crayon in the tub, other than the paper gets wet on the crayon. Don't buy this. There are lots of other things to play in the tub with."
4,Creativity for the Bath,"I have a budding artist that loves to express himself through art, so I thought, ""Why not in the bath, too?"" It gives vivid color and is lots of fun. It did take a little scrubbing to get off in places, but not too bad."
3,Bought as a Christmas gift,Bought this as a gift for the holidays so I haven't used this or gotten any feedback yet. Will give a better update after the holidays.
1,Disgruntled in Dallas,My god I've never bought a more ridiculous product. I just sold it last week at our Church Bazaar. It was hogging too much counter space and junior's wrists were getting lazy.Let the buyer beware!
3,returned,"i had to return this because the product dimensions online were slightly less than the actual dimensions of the container therefore it did not fit under my kitchen cabinets, although it does seem like a nice product"
4,So far so good,"You get what you pay for. The stand is plastic. The dispenser assembly is basic. But, so far this is working out great. I bought it for the office kitchen and we have put granola in it first and then trail mix when the granola ran out. It handled the various textures and sizes well. I am not sure how long the plastic stand will last, but so far it has been great. Thumbs up from me for the price we paid."
2,Too short,"The distance between the pour spout and base is very small. Unable to get a cereal bowl under easily, we use saucer and fill our bowl from that.."
2,Not stable,"We are keeping this but were not really satisfied with the product's stability. We are an office and were going to use this to dispense Oatmeal (we have a full pantry!) but it kept leaking. Now using it to dispense almonds and it doesn't leak, but is still not as stable as we would like. Yes, it was rather cheap and I guess you get what you pay for!"
4,Works but harder to use with larger bowls.,"I bought two Zevro Food Dispensers, and I've used them for Cereal thus far. My cereal bowl fills up most of the space between the food outlet and the grate. This sometimes makes it hard to fill the bowl completely without having cereal stack up to the wheel, and then spill over onto the counter. I have used it for granola for the past 2 months, and there has been no spillage due to the small size of the pieces. For a fun novelty item, though, this is a good buy."
4,UNIQUE,"What is it about this book that transforms one into a hauntingly romantic magical place like no other. Some pages were rather tedious that I had to skip them, but still a very unique and unforgettable read. I was thinking of giving 5 stars but felt that the writer was stilted and failed to be convincing as to the depths of feeling in the two main relationships, hence the 4 stars."
4,An Enjoyable Literary History and Mystery!,"This book was recommended as a good choice for after ""The Winter Sea."" It has a bit of the same tone; but, that is where it ends. The story follows two scholar-types who start to unravel a poet mystery. The narrative goes back and forth between current time and history. I enjoyed the overall story, narrative, and conclusion. (The only part I could have done without was the actual poetry.) This is a long and satisfying read for anyone who enjoys literary history and mystery!"
1,"Worst book I have ever read! Do not read this ""book""","This is without doubt, the worst written book ever.EVER. AS Byatt writes with extremely pretentious language. She uses words that only the best dictionaries have. Within the first 160 pages, absolutely nothing happens. The mindboggling slowness of these 160 pages is only exceeded in incompetence in the non-stop interruptions of her story, with bad poems and bad fairy tales.The book is so badly written, with so much unneccessary padding, and so many unneccessary interruptions. ... and while there may be pretentious values of the book like ""postmodern"" techniques and all that, it is a very slow, poorly written, difficult book. There is no great meaning or message. A twist, but, who cares? 500+ pages of agony"
2,matisse stories,"This series of stories/ prose was simple prattle written for women primarily. This book was a waste of time and money. Perhaps Ms Byatt was ovulating while penning this worthless and disappointing scramble of verbiage. Mostly a "" chic "" time for the brood."
1,Passionless and tiring central characters and a weak double ending,"I stayed with this novel despite the frustration of dealing with the tedious poetry and passionless characters. Deconstructing literary researchers, dull and self-involved. Only briefly interesting beginning about page 250, and towards the very end when the book converted into a conventional, but second-rate Agatha Christie mystery, quickly answered. The novel ended with an unconvincing bedding of the two main characters, followed by an almost as weak second ending. Two weak endings don't provide a strong end. In summary, this was ""twits and twats, academics all, searching for lives."" My rating is actually a 1.5, but I can't in good conscience give it a lenient 2.0."
2,Bad poetry made it hard to take seriously,"I really did not like the poems, and thought it might have been a different better book if this wasn't the case (and I actually like Victorian poetry, as I believe that's what the poems were modeling). It's hard to get involved in a book about a romance between two poets when you can't help thinking, is it me or is that poetry bad? I didn't get past page 69, as skimming through the rest of the book gave me a general idea of what I thought was in store, and I just wasn't interested. I give most books a chance but I thought this one was overrated."
4,An intellectual tour de force,"Ms. Byatt most impressively gives birth to two19th century poets within the context of a contemporary plot. Her modern day sleuths, scholars Maude and Roland embark on a long journey of intrigue, scandal, mores, and ethics; delve into the past lives of Byatt's creations; and return to reality, changed from the experience."
1,"0 stars, if I could","I have found that this book tends to really draw responses at either end of the spectrum. People either hate it or love it. I hated it. Just as several other readers wrote, I could not get into the characters. It was torturous trying to finish this huge book about people I could not connect with. One other reviewer wrote that this book is for literary intellectual types. Not true. I am what most people would call a literary intellectual type, and I though this book was awful. But, I do know several people who loved it, and if you are the type who finds the ivory tower of academia romantic, then this book is for you. If you would rather read a book that deals with real life, your time will be better spent reading any Alice Munro short story."
2,Emperors New Clothes,"I have to agree with ""Michael"" from Australia, although I liked it a bit more than he did, he is basically correct. I think Byatt is a talented writer who can evoke places and people well, however, the amount of unnecessary material is ""the emperors new clothes."" It is not only not necessary but it drags on the story to the point of distraction. Almost all of it has so little to do with the story that you have to wonder if it was a way for the author to show off her considerable skills and scholarship. That is not a good enough reason to plow through this book."
1,Yawn - a Waste of Time and Energy,"An amazingly boring book about obscure, tedious Victorian poets and the obscure, tedious modern-day academics who study them. As parody, it is about 500 pages too long. The author is apparently paid by the word. Life is too short to waste on this book. Read ""The French Lieutenant's Woman"" if you want a juxtapostion of Victorian and modern times. Unlike this book it's actually engaging."
2,I wanted to like this book,"I really did, and kept reading it even though I found it and the characters lifeless. It won the Booker Prize! Shouldn't it have been a little less predictable? A little less tiresome? But I did read it through to the end and finally found a lovely passage -- the piece about the braided hair. A Booker author should give us that level of beauty for more than just one or two pages . . ."
1,"Boring, dull, and a terrible rad","The book's plot is slow moving, with the conflict not urgent enough to keep the reader's interest. There are too many poems and other inserted pieces of writing that do not quite fit, and infact, interrupt the reader's train of thought, hoping it will lead to something....but rather it feels like a dead end. I am sad that I wasted so many hours on this book, only to put it down about 1/5 of the way in. It was a sincere struggle to even go that far."
3,Possession: A Romance,"I need to qualify my previous review because when I wrote it, I had 150 pages left to go.I still believe my assessment is on point for the first 2/3 of the book. However, in all fairness, I must admit, the last 150+ pages were rather engaging, and NOTHING like the rest of the book.It is almost as though Byatt wrote the first 400 pages or so, put the novel down for a long time and came back to it a much better writer. I was pleasantly surprised to find rich language, a better flow in style, and deeper character development. (Even the poetry seemed better--I didn't have to skip it!)Please forgive my previously negative review. I honestly thought I had read everything I needed to in order to write about the book.If you can take the beginning and the middle, the end (although somewhat predictable) is truly a pleasure to read.I stand corrected."
5,"Masterpiece, poignant and enjoyable","'Possession' is a massive, complex, perfect achievement which proves spellbounding and poingant at the same time. The most literary nover I have ever enjoyed."
4,"A good read, but flawed.","This book is a page-turner, but it did not deserve the Booker Prize. While the poetry was quite impressive, the prose was often awkward and stilted. This was distracting, but not distracting enough to stop me from finishing the book!"
5,Perfect.,"I have probably read ""Possession"" a dozen times, and it endears itself more with each reading. If, however, you are thinking of seeing the film, don't. A miserable, dumbed-down, Hollywood-ized piece of dreck."
3,Unbelievable achievement for Byatt but a rather dragging novel,"Hm.. I don't really know about this one. I think Byatt made an outstanding job with this book, it is extraordinary that she wrote not only the main story but all the different poems and diary entries and literary essays, and I think she did it amazingly. It is an unbelievable achievement. But still.. the book seems much more like a literaray analysis than an easily flowing book. Sometimes it is quite slow and difficult to keep going and that's what made it to me less enjoyable."
4,slowly takes 'posession' of you,"I have just started Posession and, I must admit, it took me a while to warm up to Byatt's stilted writing style. Some of the introductory matter was a bit tedious, but necessary. Once the plot got rolling about 50 pages into the book, I started getting more and more involved. Definitely worth the effort!"
4,"A mystery, a love story, and a feminist theme","As I continued to read this story, I kept saying out loud, ""I can't believe how much I love this book."" I am not a fan of Victorian poetry, or any poetry for that matter. I sometimes view academic scholars as out-of touch snobs. Literary criticism can sound like anal, jargon-filled jabberwocky noise to my ear. But the book has a multi-layered story with characters so real that I almost looked up Randolph Ash on the internet to see if he really existed. Also there is a mystery so well developed that I began reading the poetry looking for clues in the images and between the lines. Finally, the feminist theme of independence woven throughout both love stories hooked me, and now I plan on rereading the whole thing--something I never do."
1,Potentially Interesting Story Gets Stifled,"I must admit, I couldn't get past page 50 of this behemoth Booker Prize winner... and thank God! Because nothing I heard during my book group's subsequent discussion of it led me to believe I would have liked the remaining 500 pages. Byatt constructs a somewhat imaginative romance hidden within the poems of two obscure Victorian writers. All very nicely done I suppose, but it was putting me to sleep... Somewhere in the dreadful poems, faux letters, and overwritten prose, there is probably a decent story, however I saw little evidence of it, or of any characters to care about. I doubt I'll be spending any more of my precious time on earth in Byatt's tedious academic settings."
1,I too have tried...,"After devouring Colleen McCullough's wonderful Masters of Rome series, I was looking for something light, like romance. ""Possession"" seemed promising: forbidden love. And winner of Booker Prize.I was wrong. It was pure torture. But unlike one of the reviewers here, I managed to finished it, but not without difficulties.While struggling to read this, Dorothy Parker came to mind. She once said: ""This is not a novel to be tossed aside lightly. It should be thrown with great force.""I have tried to like this book, I really have."
2,Disappointing,"I realize this book has garnered a great deal of praise, and was thus disappointed when I finally read it. The writing is turgid and repetitious and swamps the story to the point where the poor little plot struggles and nearly suffocates. The characters are two dimensional and stereotypical, and indeed, save for the squire and his wife, who were delicately and beautifully drawn (and to me a luminous contrast to the rest of the book), seem like people the author thought might have existed, or perhaps had been told about, rather than individuals with a living, breathing presence. I wouldn't have finished it had I not been trapped on an 8 hour flight with nothing else but the flight magazine to read. Byatt gets two stars for the Squire and his wife. I wish the rest of the book had been as well written."
2,The Long Slog,"This book was recommended to me by a fellow UC alum. She majored in English Lit. and I was in the Political Science department, which may account for our differing views of the book. I found the book to be heavy in every regard--physically and literarily. And though some of the language was very beautiful, I found most of it to be dense, murky, and arcane. The latter overcame the former, and I found myself simply wanting the book to end. I also found the story too neat and tidy. No loose ends here, no unanswered questions, nothing left to ask or imagine about the characters. Not the return I expected for my time investment."
5,"Excellent, the second, third and fourth time around","I read this book years ago when it first came out. It was incredibly well written. Very much a contemporary romance novel (not the 18th century term of the word), but so well written that it defies those trashy paperbacks that line the grocery store checkout aisles. If you are looking for clever writing, intelligent adult dialogue, and a romance that makes you believe such a thing still can exist then read this book."
5,Worth the significant effort beyond any other work,"While this is not the easiest read it is probably the most satisfying work of contemporary fiction I have ever read. But the changing styles - Victorian poetry, post-modern literary criticism, contemporary narrative, among many others - make it a small challenge. Well worth it though. I have probably read this six times (highly unusual for me) and have found a new layer or three each time. And the end always breaks and heals my heart at the same time..."
2,Eh,"I bought this book after listening to a good friend rave about it, and continually hearing Byatt's name pop up in favorable reviews. Unfortunately, I could just never get into the story. While I thought the premise was interesting, the plodding story bored me to the extent that it took me about three months to finally finish the book - I kept putting it down for extended periods of time.Interestingly, the parts I really enjoyed were the poetry and letters by ""Ash"" and ""LaMotte"". I was very impressed by Byatt's ability to change tone enough to convince me another voice was there. I suppose that on an intellectual level I appreciated the skill, but I just did not enjoy reading the novel. By the end, I didn't care much about what happened to the characters - although the postscript was quite poignant.If you want to Appreciate the Literature, dive in. If you want to enjoy the plot and find out what happens, rent the movie."
5,"Delightful read involving research, history, love, and Time.","It's a puzzle, a multi-dimensional love story, a treat filled with Robert Browning and Robert Browning-like poetry and luxurious prose. Five stars."
4,A Tragedy Unfolds,Possession is a wonderful romance novel. I was totally possessed by the beautiful poems and enthralled by the love story that unfolds. A grand literary work!
4,"Rapture, Of A Sort","Having been a fairly devoted Byatt fan since ""Angels & Insects"" I felt some hesitation about reading this one, based upon the unanimously rapturous reviews from friend and colleague alike. Fortunately I was able to brush aside any preconceptions (for the most part) and focus on the sheer beauty of the writing found on each page of this fine novel. The fractured narrative left me less than wholly satisfied, but after getting such pleasure from the workings of language that almost seems like a quibble. Perhaps not a full-blown masterpiece, but still more than worthy of note."
3,Creative and Different,"I wanted to LOVE this book because I had read so much about it, but instead I ended up just liking it. I think the reason I did not love it was because it was different than I had expected. Whether or not you love it or hate it, the author deserves major credit because she created her own masterpiece world of poetry, romance, narrative, diary enteries and love letters. I know that a lot of people did not read the poetry sections of the novel and I too have to admit that a lot of it went over my head as well, but if you give these sections the time and concentration they deserve they really enhance the book. I would suggest this book to anyone who is looking to read something part romance, poetry, imagination, and literary mystery thrown into one."
3,Couldn't get into the first half of the book,"Like many other people, I found the first half of the book difficult to read. I found it boring and it seemed to drag on with no sense of direction. Roland and Maud were two-dimensional to me, I didn't feel like I knew or understood the characters. I was thinking of giving up altogether, when I started the second half of the story. Things started to pick up from there - the story started coming together, things started making sense, and I actually started enjoying the book instead of just slogging through it. For those of you who don't like the poetry, or if the poetry means nothing to you, you can probably afford to skip it. I didn't read a lot of the poetry as it didn't seem to give any vital information I needed to understand the plot of the book. Do read the letters and diaries though, they contain information you need to know. I thought the ending was absolutely beautiful. So overall, the book was worth reading but the first half was hard work."
5,Byatt shows us true craft --- AND ART!,I cannot recall the last time I read a ROMANCE that was so well crafted. That says it all.
5,One of my all-time favorite novels!,"I have owned this book since it was first published & had been waiting years to purchase it for my Kindle. I read it every year. It is an enchanting mix of love, mystery and history, blended (intentionally) with poetry and short stories...this is a HIGHLY literary book (no wonder it won the Booker Prize); if you are a casual reader who likes to skim fairly superficial fiction, it will most likely not appeal to you. If, however, you enjoy settling in with a book and immersing yourself in wonderfully formed characters -- and are willing to take a side-trip with the poetry/short stories interspersed throughout (all of which are critical to the story itself) -- then this is the novel for you. Love, love, LOVE this book."
4,high quality literature,"I am neither a poetry nor a romance fan, so I had difficulties with staying interested in this book in the beginning. But I must say that the quality of writing is so different from most of contemporary fictions, alot of which are too simplistic, even fluffy. This book requires serious concentration and a good dictionary, all worth because only the ones with literary discipline, integrity, and knowledge can write such a beautiful and ambitious book. This book has so much to offer and the author manages beautifully to put writings--epic poems, myths, letters and critics etc--by different characters without creating distraction. Totally worth struggling through. The only problem with me was that I totally predicted one of the main mysteries, which was a little bit anticlimactic."
1,Boring,I have been slogging through this book for weeks now and am only 18% into it (Kindle). I really need to finish it because our book club meets to discuss it in 4 days!
3,It's like heroin--exciting with some real down spots,"I was intrigued by the story line... But I also almost fell asleep when I had to read the piles of ""authentic"" letters and victorain poetry. Did those things really help move the plot?"
3,"""Romance"" or Disertation","Slogging through the first half of the book is definately worth reaching the second half, but I did have my doubts each time I started dozing off. I couldn't help feeling I was reading someones PhD disertation. Intellectual is okay (it's nice to see a book that is not dumbed down), but this is labeled as a romance. The author, in her role as novelist, is surprisingly poor in her portrayal of passion. However, as a poet she has a great deal of passion buried (sometimes deeply) in the poems. In particular, the section on the Victorian poets' affair is incredibly lacking in tension and passion. The book could have been made much better by a good editor."
3,"Long-winded, but worth the read","If you can pound your way through the first half of this book, you will be rewarded by an engaging read. It's greatest flaw is the attempt to create a series of passionate relationships with really very impassionate, peripherally-constructed characters.It's greatest enjoyment is the creation of a cognative scaffolding by which an incredible tale may be inferred. Be prepared to inject your own emotions into this well-constructed template. Also be prepared to die of bordom during many of the slow passages.All-in-all, I'm glad I read this book, but it will not be appealing to those who have little time to ""waste"" meandering through alternately priggish Victorian & florid prose.Yes, this book is over-rated, but still worth the trouble of reading."
1,Possesssion,"A fearfully dull book in which the author cleverly, no doubt, records the history of very dull people of no interest!"
2,"Authentic, but... (other virtues please step FORWARD)","This is a terribly slow read because it's extremelty BORING; however, it has an authentic feel to it both in terms of the portrait of scholarly problem-solving (two literary experts--who know all there is to know about One Enlgish Poet each--become detectives) and in its psychological portrayal of the love affairs that are developed simultaneously throughout the novel. The ending will leave you wondering whether you feel happy or sad; but in any case, you'll be glad you have read it."
3,Not as good as the movie,"I saw the movie, ""Possession"", with Gwyneth Paltrow and Aaron Eckhardt, and really liked it, so thought I'd check out the book. It is extremely wordy and I am still slogging through it, doggedly determined to finish it. I recommend the movie, but pass on the book unless you like obscure English literature and academic verbosity."
1,overrated and overwritten,"i believe the poems were excessive and unsubstantial and the constant interpolations of other texts, diaries, memoirs, etc(one of which exceeded 30 pages, mostly a dull rendition of victorian daily life) were simply technical writing exercises posing as literature. it was a great idea for a story, with a nod to fowles, that was poorly executed. if byatt had spent more time on just simple character development and interior life, plot, etc and less time on extended writing samples for stage scenery, it could have been a great work."
4,"Works well, mounts poorly","I'm happy I bought mine. Electronically it does all as stated, easy to set up with my Razr, I can hear, people can hear me. Life is good.Unit comes with gear to attach it to the car's visor, but this is where I have to criticize the unit. The mount's construction is poor and doesn't look at all sturdy....but worst was that when mounted, the speaker phone was hanging directly in front of my eyes, creating a driving hazard. I'm rather tall, so perhaps shorter folks would not have the same trouble. After some experimentation I found a workable solution using Velcro tape (not supplied with the speaker phone)."
2,"Boring, but she has a nice voice","I thought the album was boring. I didn't watch Nashville Star but I'm a big country music fan and I like to listen to new artists. I bought the cd and loved the catchy song ""I Break Things"". The other songs really didn't grab me, even after several listens. I was disappointed in her cover of ""I'm Not Lisa""- although Erika Jo has a beautiful voice, I found the rendition lacking emotion. She's a good singer but I hope her next album has some better material."
1,America made a mistake,"This cd is one of the worst things I've ever heard. Erica Jo sounds so monotone throughout the entire thing. She lacks the emotion the songs need. I was so excited to finally see a woman win Nashville Star. After listening to this cd, I believe someone like Tamika Tyler would've been a better pick. I am so diappointed in this cd."
1,Its Almost Cruel,"But really, its just more sad. Nashville Star is a show where a bunch of label heads, including, Anastacia ""What-the-he**-were-you-thinking-Tony Brown, pretend they actually have a clue about where country music is going. It should be noted that every Nashville Star winner prior to Erika Jo is without a label.And the latest in their dregs of dreck is Erika Jo. It is almost cruel to send a woman this clueless into a world where the sort of country she makes has already become a passe joke. So much so that Erika Jo come across almost like a Saturday Night Live Parody. From the 80's. Except that neither she nor the label suits that hired her get the punchline."
4,pretty good for a debut,"I really enjoy this CD. The lead track, I Break Things, is one of my favorites, and There Are No Accidents proves that Erika Jo can perform ballads just as well. In fact, the only song on the album I don't really like is I'm Not Lisa...I don't know, I just can't get into that one. I think that's more the song than the performer, though. Oh, and to reviewer Faithless Street from Austin, I'm not quite certain what you're talking about, and somehow I don't think you are, either. Evidence of this: your quote ""It should be noted that every Nashville Star winner prior to Erika Jo is without a label."" Um...can you say ""Buddy Jewell""? You know, winner of the very first Nashville Star? You know, performer of ""Help Pour Out the Rain""? Therefore, I must conclude that you have never actually seen the show and are just talking out your you-know-what."
4,Cute melodies,"I enjoy listening to Erika Jo. After reading some of the other reviews, I had a low expectation and I was pleasantly surprised! There are some catchy melodies and fun to sing along.Great Debut album! I look forward to hearing more of her stuff!"
2,Great voice; bad songs,"I wanted Erika Jo to win through the whole Nashville Star season, and was excited to buy her CD. But there are only about two good songs on it. On the CD, there aren't enough fast songs. I think there should be a good mix of fast and slow songs. There's one fast song and ten slow songs. They're ok songs, but it wasn't very enjoyable to listen to. I'm very disappointed because Erika Jo had such a good voice."
2,"To Be Honest, It's A Big Disappointment .",I have listened to the whole Erika Jo album and I was very very disappointed.Erika Jo has a good voice for her age but the song choices are terrible and do not fit her.I think that this album was rushed into and if more time was taken that it would have been more sucessful.This debut album has been a total flop.I don't know if she has a future in music but I do like her and I think with the right songs she could turn out pretty sucessful.
3,Good Start!!,"i saw her on nashville star and liked her right away. nothin's happened much since she won though. best songs: i break things, who you are, and good day for goodbye"
5,Love vs. Trust,"I will not cover info already covered by the other reviewers. One noteworthy addition to what has been stated is the clear information on loving as compared to trusting a toxic person. Many who deal with toxic people feel guilt themselves, feeling that they must continue to lay themselves bare for the inevitable criticism bound to spew forth from their loved ones. The info on love vs. trust describes how to protect your emotions (to entrust them to those who are worthy) from toxic people - how to love them emotionally while not necessarily trusting them emotionally."
5,Great book! Potential life changer.,"Great book for content. My wife and I are reading it and we are learning some good things to try in or marriage. Teaches you how to love hard to love people and deal with them. The copy we got was used and more damaged than I would have liked, but the content Dr. Lund provides is priceless."
5,You can't go wrong with Megabloks!,"This is a great way to get your daughter into blocks. My daughter got this for her first birthday. At first she just pulled the pieces out of the pumpkin carriage, and then put them back in. At about 13 or 14 months, she started to make simple structures with the blocks. At 18 months, she still continues to play with this toy, and loves that she can roll it around with her. I would say that a child cannot build many different things with this set - but it's a small set and is not made for that. This is great as a take-a-long toy on vacation or to Nana's!"
4,Nice Toy,This is a pretty good toy for a child. My daughter spent many happy hours dragging it around and putting the blocks together into crazy shapes. She has since moved on to other toys...
5,excellent expose with great index,fascinating book....index extremely helpful and influential in purchasing decision by library
2,COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH BETTER,"I have little UNIX or Solaris experience, so for me this book provided a spotty overview of the Solaris 8 O/S. It didn't provide an overall perspective of Solaris, tying all the pieces together to form a complete picture. It would have been great if the authors listed out the applications that come with Solaris (there are a truck load); it would have been even better if they detailed some of them. For those of us that don't have time to read through an author's opinions, this text leaves much to be desired."
5,A LABOR OF LOVE THAT MUST BE ACKNOWLEDGED,This project has to be a mad labor of love on the part of the authors -- how else / who else would produce a 3-volume directory of singing in the movies? We must applaud and support the authors for this massive work -- I can't imagine it not being definitive -- by urging local libraries to carry it. A database like this should be available to everyone!
3,What there is looks good........,"I was disappointed in this book. Beautiful pictures and ok info, but not enough examples of Lefton china. I have several inherited pieces which are clearly marked. Found only 1 in this book. I guess if you can afford to buy a large library of hardback books, finally you find what you are looking for."
4,A little-known Michael Crichton classic,"""Pursuit"" tells the story of a team of Government Agents trying to head off an assassination attempt on President Nixon during the 1972 Republican Convention. This ABC Movie of the Week featured the directorial debut of best-selling author Michael Crichton (Jurassic Park, Prey, The Andromeda Strain) adapting his suspense novel ""Binary"" (written under a psuedonym) for the small screen. Ben Gazzara and Martin Sheen star with a brief appearance by E.G. Marshall as the bad-guy industrialist behind the plot. ""Pursuit"" also features a score by the late Jerry Goldsmith, who went on to write music for many of Crichton's feature films."
2,Not a real map,"I was disappointed with this map. It should not read ""City Map"" as it was pretty much only a ""Strip Map"". I can get that anywhere on the internet."
5,A Very Thorough History of A Forgotten Corner of Liturgical History,"This book explores the long process of creating the Liturgy of the Hours. It starts out with a brief overview of the history of the Divine Office, up to and including the Pius XII/Bugnini reforms in 1955 and 1961. It then goes into how Sacrosanctum Concilium decided to mandate reforms.What follows is a painstaking, detailed, and thorough examination of all the meetings that followed from 1964 clear on into 1970. There's also a opinion section at the back, most of which I unfortunately disagreed with.For people really into the nuts and bolts of how the Divine Office became the Liturgy of the Hours, this is probably the definitive work."
2,Disappointing controller use,"I don't know what games others enjoyed that they gave this such high marks, but I couldn't get past the controller issues and other problems. Rampart in the arcade was great because you could play multiplayer vs the invaders. No such option here - you can only compete against each other. Road Blasters has to be the worst, though, since the steering controls are left, right or straight with no in-between settings. So how do you shoot something in the next lane over? You don't. What kind of port only gives you 45-degree steering in a driving game?The video looks very soft on every game, perhaps to replicate the worn-out tubes of '80s screens.I found some games I'd never played in the arcades to be fun, but Namco's Museum set such high hopes for me that these games would deliver that I can't agree with the other reviewers. Maybe you can get past the issues I couldn't, or maybe the games you loved have better control options, but this title is no longer in my collection."
5,A great collection of classic games,"Midway sure crammed in alot of great classic games into one package for 20 dollars (do the math - you're talking less then a dollar a game - how can you go wrong?)Some of the games haven't aged that well and the controlls take a little getting used to but complaints like that are pretty petty considering everything your getting.If you're not able to enjoy games which aren't graphically cutting edge then obviously look elsewhere. However if you're looking for a great collection of classic games there isn't a better purchase you can make.My personal favorites are Spy Hunter, Paperboy and Joust but just about every game in this collection is worth playing at least once or twice.Grab up a copy and have some old school fun. How many games today can you play in 15 minute sessions and still feel satisfied?"
4,Worth the money,"All in all, a nice little listen. 7 good songs, 7 slightly different styles of songs. Hard to see why a few others are down on this one!"
1,Los disappointment,"I LOVE THIS BAND! so the thought of a CD covering other artists songs sounded great. But the selections are odd and far worse than most of what these guys can do. I love their last album, ""Good Morning Aztlan"" as well as a lot of their stuff that has pushed the envelope of what to expect from ""just another band from east LA""....Kiko and Colossal Head.......but this collection seems like a bunch of throw aways at the end of the tape. The R&B; material is like from bad Tower of Power cover band. I wish Mitchell Froom had been there to tell thwm the truth during production.Bought it as soon as I saw it,..... selling it to the used store the next day."
2,Disappointing and ill thought out,"With a title like ""Apologies to Thucydides,"" what I was expecting was a more anthropological view on Thucydides' material. What I got what Sahlin's shaky justification for his tenuous and, dare I say, boring thesis.Within the first few pages I knew this book wasn't going to be what I was hoping for, but I stuck with it, only to be thoroughly confused at the random trains of thought expressed. It seems to me that Sahlins had a list of things to tie the Pelopennesian War to before he wrote the book, and just did whatever he could to connect them. The purpose behind this is dubious and isn't explained in a satisfying manner at all.I just fail to see the value in this book. My recommendation: don't waste your time. The book I was looking for, as far as I'm concerned, hasn't come out yet."
3,Buy only if you have tested before...,"Hi,I blog hardly but I thought, I share my experience w/ Shure E2C to warn people before they spend money here! After two times usage, I have decided to go back to Apple std new earbuds for following reasons:1. very thick cables, hence you need to carry the extra case which comes w/ the buds2. fitting the earbuds is an uneasy and impossible task, you better test them before and find the right way of fixing them on your ears otherwise you constantly are busy w/ pushing them back into your ears, not a nice thing when you are on the threadmill and try to concentrate on the job3. bass is only good when you have managed to get them sit properly in your earsConclusion: unless you want to spend some to fit them and don't move much and are not dying because of low bass, you will be disappointed. This is not a retail product to buy off the shelf. Shure should review the design and the distribution model...I am willing to sell my E2C less than 2 weeks old for $50+."
2,Painful,"I took a chance on this relatively expensive product after reading these very reviews. 4 stars out of five average for 250+ reviews was impressive. No question, it is well made, comes in a nice case, with a wide range of ear seals. The sound isolation comes from the tight physical seal, not any electronics. Even the smallest seals became uncomfortable after about 10 minutes listening and pulling the earbuds out was downright painful. I tested these with a Walkman while operating a blower. The Walkman was barely audible and the blower loud and clear. I was expecting the opposite. I could have tolerated discomfort had they worked, but not both discomfort and lack of noise isolation."
1,"Tinney, thin,no bass sound!","I was duped again by some decent reviews of this product.Who are these people,do they work for Shure? These were terrible! Once I managed to get them in my ear,(figuring out which was right and left,not marked,)the over the ear wire system is a complete bummer and the sound was mind bogglingly bad, like a cheap transistor radio!"
4,Great,Only reason they dont get a 5 is that these great sounding headphones do not come with a gator clip for your shirt....Other than that crystal clear...nice weight...just all around good quality..Much better than Eyptomics
1,Very disappointed,"I bought these because of the good reviews, and as a result I'm very disappointed. They don't sound great at all, it's way too much treble, the bass is just lost on these. Before I bought these, I had a pair of Sony EX51s which sounded great, but the cord was very flimsy and literally melted and dissolved after two months of use (Sony's warranty is conveniently only one month on them). The Sony earphones sounded way better and they're much cheaper.The only redeeming quality of these Shure earhones is that they come with so many sleeves, it's easy to find a pair that are comfortable for your ears. They block out sound very well as a result of this. If these were cheaper, I'd give them 2 or maybe 3 stars, but at nearly $80 I expect a LOT better sound than this, especially when the Sonys sound better at half the price. If only Sony could manufacture a decent cord to go with them."
1,Ears still hurt days after return,"The small flex sleeves were too small for my ears and so gave no bass. The medium flex sleeves were too large and would not fit in my ear. It is not as if I didn't try and make them work: I pushed, pulled and twisted them so much that my ears still hurt several days after the return.Unless you can somehow test this model before you buy you will be risking the same hassles as I have had because if you don't get a perfect fit the sound is terrible."
2,Not what I was hoping for,"In getting these earphones I was looking for something ultra-portable, easy, and good sounding.By ultra-portable I mean I want to carry them in my jeans pocket every day. While these headphones are sturdy, the sturdiness comes at a price: the case is about 1 1/4"" thick, so they don't meet my pocket-friendly requirement.These are my first experience with in-ear earphones. While they come with a wide variety of ear-piece fittings, I couldn't really find one that stayed securely in my left ear. Maybe I've got an extra-wide ear canal. Maybe I'm just uncomfortable jamming something in there so deep. So they aren't as easy and convenient as I wanted.When in position, they do sound great. The sound quality varies a lot if they come out of position even a little, though.For someone who doesn't have the same criteria as me, and who has had success with in-ear earphones, these could be great. But they just weren't what I was looking for."
1,Bad Quality,"Usually I equate the name Shure with quality microphones, but they fall short with these earphones. They sounded good while it lasted, but unfortunately, that wasn't long. After less than a month of normal use, they developed a short on the sleave where the headphones connect to the jack, now, one month and $80 later, they are unusable.Think twice before ordering these."
2,This product is definitely over-rated,"I got Shure E2c sound isolating earphones primarily for use during flights. Although I have yet to test the sound isolation capability, I'm really disappointed with its overall sound quality. I have been using Sony earphones which cost about a quarter of what I paid for these, and I must say Sony sounds a whole lot better than these Shure earphones."
2,Not as good as outside the ear,"I have these and tried them and they are ok, but I like outside the ear phones better. Reasons:a. they isolate ambient sound betterb. they feel more comfortablec. they don't add decibles to the sound you hearNote that according to audiologists, inside the ear phones add about 7 decibles to the sound you are generating (because the phones are directly inside your ear canal). Thus, if you are listening at 90 dbl, it becomes 97. Potentially tinnitis producing !!If you want to isolate ambient sound, such as in an office environment, I would suggest Bose or EX29 ""Extreme Isolation"" headphones. The EX29s are about $ 90 and are BIG, but they work very well."
1,Yuck!!!!!,These have to be the worst ear phones I have ever heard. The sound is very thin with almost no base response. I very surprised because I've used Shure products for years.I hope I can return them.
3,Yet to be convinced,I recently bought a 5.5G ipod and decided that after getting the best ipod I should get good earphones for it. I decided on the E2's as they are well reviewed and were affordable compared to the rest of the high end in ear market.The phones come with 3 types of insert which in turn have different sizes. The squashy orange type are what Im currently using. They certainly block out any sound other than the music but get dirty easily. The added pressure on the ear drum is still taking some getting used to.I have been tempted to send them back but Im going to try out the rest of the inserts and then make a final decision. I want to like them! There is a noticeable improvement in the bass I will give them that much and I can easily wear sunglasses with them.
4,Try them on first,"While very promising, I had trouble getting these earphones to stay in my ears. Shure tried their very best to accommodate a large portion of the ear population by including nine different sleeves, but no matter which set of sleeves I tried, no matter how hard I willed for them to stay in my ears, it was not to be. I had to send them back with a substantial ($20? $25? I don't remember) restocking and repackaging fee.During the brief intervals during which they stayed in my ears, they sounded good and muffled outside noises considerably.Before you buy, find a way to try them out, or at least have some confidence that your ears are of average size and shape."
2,Didn't work for me,"I bought the Sony MDR-EX71SL a year ago and they worked great, but my son lost the ear buds. So I thought I would upgrade to the Shure or Etymotic. The Shure E2c was a mistake. The phones kept slipping out of my ear, there's little bass, and poor sound isolation. I could try the Shure E3c, but that's almost 5x more expensive than the Sony's I had.I'm going to order a new pair of the sony ex71sl. It had better sound isolation, stayed in my ear, were comfortable, and sounded good. Perhaps they boost the bass a little, but I'm not a expert on this. The Sony just work better for me."
4,Good earphones,"These are very good sounding earphones. Yes it takes a bit to get used to putting them in and figuring out what attachment fits for you. And yes the bass is not the very very best you could probably get. I got these because one they are from Shure, so you know you are getting a good product. And two, their price is down so much because the e3c, e4c, and e5c are out now. And I didn't need the bleeding edge of earphone tech. I just use them for running and they do do a very good job of isolating you off from outside noise. Especially when you use the foam inserts."
4,"Great sound, but a little uncomfortable","These sound great, but it takes a while to get used to them. I also don't like the cord placement; you have to wrap it around your ears and behind your head. It would help if the cord was thinner and more flexible.The sound is clear and balanced; these are not for deep bass lovers."
2,"Held out hope, but had to give up",6 months on: these just never fit right and suddenly the left one stopped working entirely. The Shures also create noise from the cord bumping against you on the treadmill. Went with V-MODA and they fit and sound great.
5,"Great ""Ear Buds""","I have used Shure phono cartridges for thirty-five years, so I was quite confident when I purchased their latest 'sound isolating earphones'. They were a gift for my seventeen year old son for his i-River mp3 player. He has gone through about a half dozen pairs of earbuds purchased at the local superstores in the last year or so.He said his first two or three times wearing the Shure Ear Buds were a ""strange"" feeling in his ears - they don't fit the way the less expensive models fit. Compared to the previous ear buds, these blocked 'outside noise' and then delivered super musical definition directly to his ears. He said it didn't take long at all to get used to these, if nothing else just because the sound was so superior. He also says he doesn't have to boost the volume so high with the Shures.He is a big fan of high quality guitar music and listens to ""home stereo"" with Grado headphones, so when he gives the Shure Ear Buds the ""thumbs up"" - it is saying a lot!"
4,good sound quality; good isolation,"As opposed to other models I've tried, this set provides good isolation from ambient sound. The quality of the audio is also satisfactory, if a bit light on the bass end."
1,Not for everyone.,"Personally, I think these sound terrible (weak bass, distorted high end, midrange bias) and tried every combination of all of the ear sleeves. Only with a lot of cramming could I ever get the bass to work and then it would mess up the highs. Very likely its just the specific shape of my particular ear canal. Who's to say that even 6 different sleeve types are enough?For travel, I do have some non-earplug type earbuds that came with an inexpensive mp3 player I actually prefer - found them by accident after trying both Sony and the Shure earbuds and not liking either. Did not try the high $$ ones though.I would suspect many people might have a problem with the ear plug type headphones. If high quality, accurate sound is important and you can put up dragging around a full sized over the ear headphone the Sony MDR 7502 is one I would recommend that sounds great and is inexpensive and works well with low output devices like portable mp3 players."
2,Not as good as I expected,"Yes, these earphones do isolate the sound around you; however, they magnify the sound of your breathing and your heart beating to the point of distraction. Unfortunately, these earphones will join the pile of other also-tried's."
3,Left earbud stopped working after a year.,"After a year of normal use when I first bought it in 2007, the left earbud began to cut out and until the point where it just stopped working entirely."
2,Shure E2c Sound Isolating Earphones - not for my music,"Thank goodness I got these on a Gold Box deal. Only paid about $40 for these and to tell you the truth, they are not worth the money when it comes to listening to music. There is almost no bass in these earphones. I listen to a lot of audio podcasts and books on my iPod, so the lack of bass is not a big loss. However, for my music the loss of the bass range is a big deal.Pros for these earphones are:- good ear-external sound isolation. great fit due to the multiple cushions- like the over the ear wire wrap (except if the wire accidentally get caught on something. gives your ears quite a pull)- like the thicker wire. feels like better qualityCons for these earphones are:- no bass frequencies come through at all- jack a bit large for use with some iPod cases, absolutely overwhelm a Nano unit.Bottom line: Not worth even the Gold Box price. A better choice would be almost any of the Sennheiser MX series earphones."
4,Worth the wait? Pretty much!,"I have followed prices related to the Shure E2c headphones for well over three years; when an Amazon saver e-mail found its way into my inbox a month ago I was happy to take the plunge at a discounted price of more than 60% off retail. The sound from the headphones, while not as rich as I had dreamed of, is very nice and after a solid week of fiddling with the enclosed foam sleeves and flex sleeves I'm a happy camper. Let's put it this way - these are the best $40 earphones out there."
4,Sounds Good,"I'd read a lot of good things about these earphones so I plunked down the hundred to buy them. It was definitely money well spent and they do exactly as advertised. I used them mostly just with my ipod and now I hear things in songs that I never even heard before. I actually went and re-recorded some of my songs at 320 kb and could actually notice a difference. They're also good for using on the tractor as an alternative to earplugs. My only complaints are that they're not AS sound isolating as I thought they would be. I can't hear people talking but I can still hear some of what's going on around me. They work about the same for sound isolating as foam earplugs do. Also, the ear pieces get pretty nasty after a while. But those are just nitpicks for what are otherwise excellent headphones. Definitely the best I've ever used."
1,Not a 5 stars for Everybody!,"I bought this item after reading the amazing reviews just to find that this earphones are not for everybody. They are very uncomfortable because of the pressure inside the ear. I disliked the lack of ventilation because it felt unnatural. I was not amazed by the audio quality, it lacks detail and power unless you want to pump up the volume and maybe damage your ear. I'm sure that Sure makes great products but this canal phones disappointed me.Pros: Good construction, carrying case, cable length.Cons: Uncomfortable, audio quality.I am returning this item to Amazon. As always exelent customer service! 5 stars for Amazon."
2,Had to return them,Not sure if this was a one off problem. I had to return them as the sound was really bad on my IPod Touch.
2,Not Good Enough,"Well, i realized almost directly after opening these that i didn't want them. I like bass a lot and their just wasn't any in these. on the the hand, the fit was great and the sound was pretty clear. Just not enough to listen to music, more for speech."
4,Great sound,"These headphones have a great quality of sound. The mix is just great. The only thing I will say about them is that they are totally noise cancelling. If you need to pay attention while listening, then you won't be able to hear a thing if you are using these headphones. I was listening to a full episode of LOST on the internet and missed like 3 phones calls because I couldn't even hear the phone. Unlike other headphones that you can hear relativley good what is going on around you, with these SHURE ones, you cannot. That is the only thing sorta negative about it. Other than that, they have SUPER great quality of sound."
2,Good quality if they fit.,"So I bought these headphones just because I had heard how well they worked. To my disapointment I had a hard time fitting them into my ears. They were very hard to adjust to, and I would not recomend them to anyone who has smaller ears. Also it was complicated how to wear them, because they made you put the cord around your ear so they would fit in the canal. Since they didn't fit they did not cancle noise at all.On the positive side though, I could tell the cord was high quality because of its thickness.If you think you can fit them in, it might be a good product for you. If you are unsure, do not take the chance."
4,Not Bad,"Pros: Decent, sturdy earphones. Noise canceling works best when music is turned on. Much better than the Bose in-earphones that can easily slide out of your ears especially if working out in a gym. I would definitely recommend them. Comes with various tips for best fit.Cons: The cord is way too long that can be used as a dog leach."
4,Excellent Earphones for the Money!,"I originally bought these Shure E2Cs for my commute to work. After doing my research online I ended up buying these pair of headphones. There are a lot of reviewers who did a great job of capturing their experiences so I will just keep this short and simple.The sound coming from these earphones are great! Like what other posters state, you have to try ALL the other sleeves because everyone has different types of ear canals. So try them all. In the end I chose the clear sleeves which gave a better fit and comfort that helped a lot with the Bass.My only problem with my Shure E2Cs is the way the cords have to slide behind your ear. In the beginning it didn't faze me that much but as I got to use it everyday the stiff cord would not seat well behind my ear. I felt liek the cord had a mind of its own. lol Other than that I believe these are excellent Earphones that you should get especially if you're in a budget.Enjoy Them!"
2,Dissapointed,"I bought these over a year ago. I couldn't be more disspointed with them. Although the midrange and higher sounds ok, it's nothing to write home about. I didn't like the fact it has almost no bass. You won't get any bass if they are not sealed in your ear, so I tried all the pad sizes and still no bass. I don't like how they stick out of your ear at all. I feel like I put the money through the paper shredder I shelled out for these."
3,"Good case, unconfortable fit, OK sound.","Sound is not very good, the normal Iphone buds are actually better for normal listen, since the base is not very good and music sounds quite flta. The sound canceling works fine on airplanes etc.Comes with a nice sturdy case which protects them.Next time I'd look into buying the model up E4c, for better sound quality."
3,"great sound, value","For those people who say there's not enough bass, either you got them on wrong, your ears are shaped funny, or just messed up. Great low freq response with everything from Kanye West to John Mayer to Vivaldi. Highs and mids in good balance.Overall there's good and bad, but for the $60 they go for now, I say it's a no brainerpros:flat, accurate reproduction; great isolation; valuecons: fit can be tricky, durability is an issue. my first pair died after a year and a half, replaced under warranty. second pair, wire insulation cracked in 2 places after after about 13 months , exposing the wiring (but works fine), which is why I give it 3 stars instead of 4/5. At least the service people never gave me any problems."
3,Not enough Bass,"These are not as good as I thought they'd be. The bass is way too buried, even for using them just as monitors for recording. If you want them to make your Ipod music sound better, forget about it, it's just not gonna happen. These headphones could not sound any more flat, thus your music is not going to sound fun & exciting with these. If you turn the bass up, these headphones turn into a distorted mess.These are good, or even great for analyzing music, except bass. It simply gets lost....ans yes, they formed an air-tight seal in my ear."
5,"So far, really good",Go deep into your ears. My friend said no bass but I disagree. It's quite effective even while working out. First couple of sessions you'll feel odd as if you can hear your own heartbeat but then u're used to it.
4,great sound,"The ear buds that came with my nano were crap! Not only was the sound not great, but they hurt my ears and were always falling out. These are a tad confusing at first...as far as how to put them into your ears... but not for long. The sound is really quite good and I can do mindless work around the house without distraction from others. Vaccuming is noiselesss! Be warned; people can and will sneak up on you, dont wear them when you need to have your wits about you.the only things that I would change:* the cord over the ear thing is hokey, it seems like there must be a better way to deal... but in order to keep them small I guess not* I dont care for the way it plugs into my i pod, it seems like that would be something to really work on, the plug and the connector/cord comes out at a right angle and is kind of bulky and not flexible plugged into something so very smallother than those petty things, I am really impressed"
5,great sound..,"after being contented using my apple ipod earphone (with griffin earbuds) i decided to buy this Shure E2c isolating earphones as my bday gift for myself.at first, it is very difficult to get the perfect fit.. but after 20minutes of trying all the sleeves, i got the perfect sleeve and fit.its funny but when i wear this i have to open my mouth wide (so my ear canal will also open) fit and seal it in and the sound is just GREAT! i never knew i was missing a lot just by using the earphone that came with my ipod 4th gen and now im using ipod 5th gen.I would recommend this one."
3,Not life-changing,"These are ok, but frankly most people won't really be able to tell the difference in sound quality between 25.00 earbuds and 100.00 earbuds. The sound reduction is not quite as impressive as I had hoped - I suspect the ear-covering style (Bose, etc.) might insulate more from airplane drone.Also, the way Shure wants you to curl this around your ear from the back, over the top, and down is a little too persnickety for my taste. I found myself reaching for my basic Sony buds just for the ease of use.I also found the sensation of the earphones in my ear canals wearing after some use."
4,Great pair of headphones,"These are great headphones. I own a pair of Bose noise cancelling headphones (Bose QuietComfort 2 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones). And while the Shure headphones do not block out as much unwanted noise as the Bose they do significantly reduce the amount of ambient noise.I use these on public transport and get much of the benefits of the Bose but without being as noticeable (people on the bus wearing circumaural [""around the ear""] headphones tend to stand out) and at a much lower price point. Also the Shure E2c headphones are much easier to store."
2,Disappointingly tinny,"Very little bass, compared to my existing earpods for my iPod. Weak and tinny sounding. Very disappointing."
4,"Sweet sound, not so sure about the fit","Well, the sound isolation seems to be good. I can hear my heartbeat and breathing, so I don't know if more isolation would help. The sound is as good as any headphones I've heard, better than my Sony MDR-V6 headphones. Piping the sound into your head seems to help you hear details, too.Unfortunately, I have really small ears, and the E2cs hurt a bit. I was hoping to take them out for long bike rides, and that might not be possible. Both the smallest poly sleeves and the actual phones against my ears are larger than is comfortable.Still, I love the sound, so I'm going to say these deserve consideration unless you have small ears."
1,If they didn't break I would love them,"First - I could really love these headphones. Great sound and has been great in heavy noise situations - especially New York subway.However, due to their lack of durability I cannot recommend anyone to buy these.The piece of the wire that goes around the ears cracks and falls apart. Mine started going within about 6 months, and it wasn't even everyday use.I bought mine when they were still going for full list price of around $100, which makes it an even worse investment. I definitely didn't intend to buy disposable headphones at that price."
1,Junk,"After 6 months they are falling apart. One of the earphones broke in half, so I have been listening out of one ear only. The second one is now full of static....I have had $10 earphones last longer! BTW, I only use them for about an hour a day, so definitely not a heavy user.Even before they started breaking down, I was dissatisfied with them. None of the earbuds fit - I have gone through all of them trying them for a few weeks at a time. The cord is too heavy so the earbuds keep falling out when I am walking or jogging. I spent most of the time getting frustrated and jamming them into my ear canals than actually enjoying the music. They are ok if you listen to them in bed or when you are not moving - which defeats the purpose, especially at the $70 price tag.Save your money, and try something else! I am about to find out how the warranty works..."
4,Fine earphones,"As a frequent flyer and a musician I was looking for a something small with good sound that would block out some of the loud airport/airplane noise - and that was more comfortable than the hard plastic earbuds that come with most MP3/CD players. These fill the bill on every score and I'm very pleased with the set I just got. The 2 year warrantee is good as well. The sound is good - even reasonably good on the low end - and I'm a bass player. Not as good as high quality over the ear headphones of course, but much better than the set that came with my most recent Sony CD player. For the price - about $63 - these are a good investment in good music and hearing protection. They come with a variety of foam and rubber inserts that should make for a comfortable fit for most ears - and they stay in place well when I'm walking around. I'm perfectly satisfied with these."
4,Some love some don't,I happen to love my new Shure E2c headphones especially with the soft foam inserts because I think the bass is better. I thought it was missing a little bass with the clear inserts and I bought a pair for my girlfriend and she did not like it with either insert. I kept her pair in case something happens to mine :)
3,Not for people with small ear canals,"While the sound of these earphones is very good, they simply don't work for people with small ear canals. No matter how hard you try to jam them in, they will not stay in without excruciating pain."
3,Not worth it,"I own the Sennheisers and these E2c headphones and these aren't half as good. The sennheisers sound way better with more range and way more bass. These headphones really lack bass if you like hip hop/ dance/ reggae/ R&B; etc. Personally I like punchy base in all types of music.Anyhow, these headphones do have longer and more durable wires, but the configuraton is awquard and cluncky into the ear. The sennheisers are more comfortable to me and a lot more suttle."
4,earphones,"Great quality fit,have not had earphones that have so many options to fit your ear,but the quality of bass is a bit weak,great sound but I prefer more bass"
5,Great Sound. Comfortable. Pricey.,"If you own an ipod just to look cool, stay with those stupid white apple earbuds and hurt your ears to death. But if you really love and enjoy listening to music and want to hear all the little details in a track, get this pair. You will be surprised. I have been using them for almost 6 months. The wire is not thin, it's durable and the plugs are comfortable. The case is nice, too. Bass is little weak, I guess. But I don't listen to hip-hops. So it's OK with me. Little pricey though."
3,Decent Product,I am not a audiophile but enjoy listening to music. I found these headphones to have good music quality but gave it three stars because the fit was not great. They are just not very comfortable headphones (from earpiece to wire and behind-ear) - just did not fit well with me.
1,think twice before buying,The earphones are very uncomfortable when inserted and the sound quality is poor. The store return policy does not allow for returning earphones so purchases are final. Very unhappy with the item.
1,Expected a more durable product,"At this price point I expected a durable ,well engineered product. within a month of use I started noticing small cracks in the wires near the earpieces .I figured it would be OK,they're thick wires. It's not OK ,they broke after 2 yrs. of lite use.I read thru some reviews, there seems to be a lot of consumers reporting same issue. Shure offers a repair service, but I can buy a better set of in-ear buds for substantially less than the repair will cost.... theAltec Lansing UHP336 Snugfit In-ear Earphone(which have user replaceable cords)"
1,Don't waste your money,I received these as a gift. They now sit in drawer in my house. I would not recommend these. Sound is terrible. Comfort is okay.
1,not what I expected,"I had been told that these were far superior to the phones that come with the ipod. Unfortunately (to my ears) they sounded much more ""tinny""."
1,Shure E2c Sound Isolating Earphones,"Stinks. The sound on my $8.00 Sony headphones are 1000X better than these., and don't constantly fall out of my ears. I couldn't believe how much these cost after I tried them. They should be $8.00 as well."
1,Terrible!,Broke after 1 month of light use? Can hear anything from them now! I got ripped off big time. Avoid these at all costs.
2,Why do so many people think these things sound good?,"People who think these are great earphones must be severely hearing impaired. The highs are nice & crisp but there's absolutely no bass & they will not stay in my ears. Three guys at work tried them & all agree they are over-priced crap.On the plus side, they seem to be well made & the cord is thicker than any of the other headphones I own."
1,Shipping taking too long!!!,"I ordered this product over a month ago and still haven't received it. A month for delivery is a bit ridiculous! I was originally given an estimated delivery date of Oct 3, then received an email that week saying it wouldn't ship until this week! If I hadn't purchased as a gold box item, I would have cancelled the order."
2,Looks really cool...but not really,"I recieved these today and I have to say that I was really excited about getting them, but I have to say that I am disappointed with them. Once I got through the time consuming process of figuring out which mold fit my ear, I finally got them in. To be really honest, they are not noise canceling compared to my Bose noisecanceling headphones. Yes, I know the bose headphones have added noise.. but who cares.. .anything that makes the noise go away is fine with me. So all in all these are expensive headphones that are really not worth it."
1,disappointed,"After reading all the hype on the Shure earphones, I purchased the E2C earphones. I was really disappointed in the sound quality once I got them. I have to push and hold the ear pieces in my ears to get a tolerable sound quality. If you like extreme treble in your music, then this product is for you. My first interest in earphones was the Bose earphones but was turned off when the reviews said they put out too much base. Judging from the sound of these earphones have zero base unless I press them against my eardrum, I think Bose is just what I am looking for."
2,Only OK,For what these cost they are a disappointment! Bass is almost non-existent! The quality is what you would expect out of a $20.00 pair.
1,Not for small years,"Very low bass response unless you really push them into your ears, but they won't stay there, specially if your ear canals are small. Not at all what I was expecting."
1,Don't fit my ears,"Ok, so I have small ears. None of the options for ""earbuds"", foam or plastic would fit deep enough into my ear for me to hear all of the sound. I had to cram the foam insert into my ears so that it was VERY uncomfortable for me to hear the bass at all. So I returned them."
2,Extremely Disappointed,"I was really looking forward to these things. I forked out over a hundred bucks, after shipping and taxes, so I knew I was in for a treat. I was so wrong. First of all, they are very uncomfortable, now I know that everyone's ear is different, but for mine, these don't work. Second, I am a fan of deep, rich bass. They don't have it. Besides the weak bass they do have pretty good sound quality, that is why they are getting atleast 2 stars from me, but for my musical tastes, they just fell short. I really wanted to like these given what I paid for them, but I just can't get into them. Very Disappointing."
2,Good sound - don't last,"These have good sound but, I have had to buy 3 pairs over the past year (to my shame) the internal wires become disconnected from the speakers after a couple months of light use. Steer away from these."
2,Piece of Junk,"Very very low bass, kills the whole song. Low end frequencies sound fine but bass needs to be much better."
4,great product.,"well worth the price. mine came w/ 9 different earbuds. 3 foam sleeves in small med and large and 3 soft flex sleeves in small med and large as well as 3 stiffer flex sleeves in small med and large also. the hardest thing about these earphones are finding the right size and shape earbuds, but after you play around with the different ear buds and find the right one, they are great. they are extremely comfortable once you get use to them. the sound is terrific and the design nearly blocks out all outside noise. great for busy environments. just be careful jogging with them in busy streets 'cause you won't be able to hear cars driving by, but great product overall. was hesitant to buy because of the price. i figured i could get two pairs of regular ear buds for that price, but am glad i spent the money. you really do get what you pay for. would recommend this product to anyone looking for ear phones w/ really good sound quality."
4,"Very detailed overall sound, but evident lack of bass","This are not for bass-lovers, but for the people that love to listen to classic music, jazz, and others not-so-bass music."
3,Hard to put in,While the sound is good they are very hard to put into the ear and very hard to keep them in once installed. Not very comfortable.
5,Shure E2c- the best,"I love my Shure E2c earphones. I work as an aircraft mechanic, so I am around alot of noise all day. I used to wear foam ear plugs while working. But now that i have my E2c's, they are all I use. They act as ear plugs when I am working and as awesome earphones for listening to my ipod. I love shure products. Well worth the money. Thanks shure."
4,Amazing design,"without a doubt, this is an innovative design, I could never have thought of fitting in a earpiece like that. That said, it is not easy to fit in, I am quite confused and require a mirror to place it in.its sound is great, blocks out so much noise that the music is just great, people have to shout at you for you to hear, think earplug+earphone.Can't use it for exercise. You will hear your steps and your pounding heart. Just like when you use earplug and you can hear your heartbeat.all said, if you use it exclusively to ignore other people, it's great. :) saw it on sale at amazon, referred by WhoSave coom (list online electronics sale). Good price, good value."
2,really unpleasant after the break-in. not for me.,"Didn't mind them at first - had my hopes up, since I believe in breaking in quality components. I have broken these things in thoroughly. Listened via my iPod and my computer. I have come to the conclusion that they are like early high-end audio and studio monitors - lots of detail, utterly unnatural and thin tonalities. Music sounds bleached. Comparing them to the Etymotics ER-6i - which may simply be a better match for the devices I'm using, but I don't think so - the ER6i is a bit more detailed, has much more impactful bass, sweeter tonality and in general sounds more like music. I will miss the heavier construction and behind the ear security of the Shure's, but, to my tastes, they have become increasingly unpleasant to listen to. The Etymotics are a bit more money, but not much, and they are designed, clearly, by people in touch with the FEEL of music, not just the frequency range."
3,Great sound but super uncomfortable,"Even with the smallest tips on the earbuds, these are too large for my ears. I can wear them but they don't stay put, and are a little uncomfortable. Sound is great though, if you don't have freakishly small earholes these are probably amazing."
3,"Great sounding headphones, questionable build quality",I bought these headphones back in 2009. These headphones performed great. They blocked out a decent amount of background noise and the sound quality is great as well. However once the product was out of warranty the cables began to tear and peel apart. They still lasted about 5 years through a combination of gentle use and electrical tape. They now no longer work. Because of this I would question Shure as a long time purchase option since the cable issue started after the 2 year mark. However despite all this I plan on trying to solder together a new cable and see if they still work just for fun since I've gotten new headphones since these died.
4,Just a quick positive review.,"I use these once every week or two to play at church, and they've done the job well for me.Getting used to using in ear monitors is a different issue, but that has nothing to do with this equipment.These are comfortable, and wear well. I'm, glad I bought them."
5,Spectacular Performance,These earbuds were more than I ever expected them to be. The sound clarity is absolutly amazing. Every little sound ranging from the plucking of a guitar to the deep thump of bass drum is clearly and accuretly recreated. Sound isolation is great as well. You can mow the lawn without any interference with your music. They also seem to have a somewhat wider field of sound on particular songs making it seem like you have surround sound. Overall for the money these earbuds are an absolute steal and would be hard to beat at this price level. I would highly recommend them to any audiophile who is on budget.
4,Not bad!,"I mostly listen to eletronic music - drum and bass, ambiant, jungle, IDM, etc. So the bass of these earphones somehow disappointed me at first. But I tried some other music and slowly discovered the diversity of sounds these earphones are capable to play clearly. For those of you who have bought this product and hated it, listen to Brian Eno's ""Music For The Airport"" with it, you will see why you have spent $100 for it."
2,"Good sound, painful for the ears","wow, i was severely disappointed with this product. i always was conscious of it being in my ear since it never fit properly (with any of the sleeves), but the worst thing is that after taking them out my ears were either pressurized or in pain.the only reason why this product gets two stars is because the sound was good.i would stay away from it though."
2,Good sound until they broke...twice.,"i bought two, not one, pairs of these because i liked the noise canceling and the sound was ok. but the first pair broke from normal wear and tear after get this 4 months, the second did so after 3 months. and after spending $200 ($100 per pair) in one year i tried to do the warranty thing. guess what they said??? we dont replace phones with ""physical damage"". well if they were made better there would be no physical damage from using them EXACTLY as the instructions say 3 times a week for 3-4 months.a complete waste of money. if you have money to throw into head phones like these 4 times a year there are worst ways to spend your money."
2,Not for Bass Boosters,"I would not recommend E2C's for people who prefer the Boom in their ear. Although really great response for High and Mid range frequencies, its the Low that is the killer. My Sony Fontopia (EX51) sounded better in Lows and its only 1/3rd price. The sound isolation was pretty good though. Another aspect was the lack of labeling on the sides, instead it is color coded. You have to remember which color goes where. But I guess you can get used to that. Overall my opinion is - I returned mine after a week of use."
3,"Not Bad, Not Great","These are probably the best buds you can get at this price. Keep in mind that these are ""sound isolating"" -- NOT ""noise canceling"". The cushions take some getting used to and are probably going to be either too big or too small for most people. Sound is good but bass is lacking."
3,good for running,"I have searched all over for a decent pair of earphones for running. These definitely stay in your ears relatively well. Sound is okay, but I would expect better from shure. Bass level is not impressive. Overall, these are a decent pair of sound isolating earphones that will stay in your ears when running."
5,Anyone who says the bass is inadequate has them in their ears wrong,"Plain and simple. These put out almost as much bass as my $150 Pioneer mixing headphones. They sound great, kind of shiny from around 5khz-up but if you eq and amp them properly this is an amazing set of earbuds, especially for the price."
4,Great for what it does,"When properly fitted, it will block out any noise you don't want to listen to (like in a gym, or tanning booth). That's why I bought them. Not for use in cars if you're the driver.Comes with a nice long sturdy cord, which is great on a treadmill. Doesn't tangle like thin ones. And it's half the price of equivalent items.Comes with lots of tips to fit all types/sizes of ears.One drawback is since they work like earplugs, you can hear any sound that you would with plugs. Try sticking your fingers in your ears and tapping your teeth and you'll know what I'm talking about.And when you take them out of your ears, you have to yawn a few times to get your ears to pop.But if you want to block out everything except what you want to listen to, they're excellent."
2,Not Durable enough for me!,"I love these earphones don't get me wrong,,,the sound is soooo freakin' great. I have already purchased two pairs in the past year and a half,,making me think...I'm spending way tooo much money on earphones,,well the last two pairs i bought were for almost 100 dollars a piece. So for that type of money, i was hoping they would be able to keep up with me,,which they surely are not, I am always on the go and listening to my Ipod almost 2 hours a day on a regular work day,,due to public transport, but putting these things in my bag and out of my bag four times a day,,seem to much for this product, the last two pairs lasted me for a couple months. I just wish they were more durable. One headphone just simply dies out,,won't let any music through, then later the other one gives out too, unless you pinch the cord on an exact spot you can have one earbud working,,but i'm just giving up and going for a cheaper version."
5,Great quality for a great price,It comes with multiple size and texture ear bud covers to give the best fit for your ears. Sound quality is crisp and clear.
5,Great headphones,I love these. Lost one pair and bought another the next day. They shipped fast and I haven't found a better price.
4,"Great sound, noise cancelling, nice Bass","Shure E2c Sound Isolating EarphonesI purchased these headphones about 18 months ago. So far, they are the best phones I have found. Good bass, cancels out noise better than the Bose ""noise cancelling"" and they have a pretty good fit. Two things I don't like as well. 1. Over the ear wires. In order to get a proper fit, you have to drape the wires over your ears and then back down. 2. Ear fit. Although Shure gives you multiple options for ear sizes, these don't fit just right for me unless I ram them into my ears.Overall this is a GREAT set and I highly recommend them."
1,Didn't last a year,"I was loving my E2Cs up until they started to show wear in very little time. I used them everyday for work and the gym. Unfortunately they could'nt withstand the abuse. In less than a year I had to send them in for warranty replacement. Due to the inherent design flaw of the cord wrapping around the ear, the plastic around the earbuds becomes ridgid and cracks, exposing the bare wire. If you do not use them everyday, they will last you but I'm sure that they will eventually succumb to the same demise as my E2Cs.The hardening/cracking of the cord that wraps around the ear is a known problem that has been addressed in the more expensive E5C ($400!), which also uses the wrap-around design. But since these are sub $100 earbuds, these were not designed to last."
1,disapointed; no bass,"I knew these earphones would not be the best from Shure, but I expected a better sound compared to the original ones that came with the Apple video iPod. I tried to wear them as recommended, deep in the ear canal and all, and I couldn`t here any bass after a lot of pain trying to fit them. Two friends tried it and they also said the original iPod phones sound nicer. Unless my pair has a defect, I don`t recommend buying them."
3,Impossible to use while walking or running,"The sound on these phones was pretty good, but not as good as I had expected given all the positive reviews I have read. They were uncomfortable at first, but I adjusted to them.The big problem: when you walk or run, your breathing and walking are vastly amplified. This was a killer. I returned them and got another pair of Sennheiser X100 headphones, which I love."
3,Great headphones but 2 pairs broke within a year,"I love these earphones- they are comfortable and the sound is excellent. I actually bought 2 pairs, one for me and one for my husband. 6 months after we bought them, my husband's pair broke, where the connection in one ear continually broke up. Now, 9 months after purchase, my own pair is having the same problem. I'm guessing it's due to the design of the earbuds, which go up and over your ear, and the continual bending probably wears the connection out quickly.I contacted Shure with my receipt and they immediately replaced my husband's pair. Hopefully they do the same with mine, as there is a 1 year warranty on these headphones.Considering the price and the low life span of them, I wouldn't purchase these again. If Shure made another product that didn't require the bending/twisting of the wires then I'd gladly stay with Shure."
1,Not worth it for the price,"I'll keep this short and simple. For this price, these headphones should stand up to normal, or even a little rougher than normal usage. They fail in this respect. Sure the sound quality is good and so is the noise isolation characteristics, but none of that really matters when one of your ear bud's goes out and you have to pay $50 to get it fixed. Sorry Shure, if you want to charge the money you have to make a product that's worth it."
2,"Sure, they sound good, but they HURT your ears!","I bought a pair and I pretty much never wear them anymore. They definitely sound great, and they block out all external sound, so all you hear is the music. . . BUT, I find them very uncomfortable to wear. The so-called ""flex sleves"" are relatively hard plastic. After about 1/2 hour in my ears they really start to hurt. The foam sleves are marginally better, but take a lot longer to put in.I think there is a variation on this product that has soft rubber sleves with ridges, rather than the plastic ""cones"". Those are probably a lot more comfortable (and expensive)."
5,"Sound great, block all noise","The Shures are great. I got them to replace the standard iPod headphones and the difference is night and day. I don't have to crank up the volume to hear the music over background noise because they block out nearly all other sounds. Just make sure they aren't turned down too far or you won't hear the bass too well. It takes a couple uses to get used to the buds being in your ear. Once they're in though and the volume is right, they really pump. Everything from rap, to rock, to classical sounds awesome."
4,Very Good but you have to........,"make sure you get the right fit from all the ear buds you get to choose from. It's taken a lot of trial and error for me to get the proper fit. I use the E2cs with my iPod Touch and at $49, you can't beat them. If I had anything negative to say it would be that sometimes they sound a bit tinny-but normally I can adjust the earphones in my ear and get a better seal, thus providing a bit more bass."
4,Great sound. Lacking bass,"I read alot about these headphones before I purchased them and just about everything that you read is true. They do have great sound. You do have to stick them way into your ear in order for them to work properly. However, it is true that these are lacking in bass somewhat. For most listeners I'm sure its fine, but personally I prefer to have a lot of bass and it doesnt give me as much as I want. I'd recommend these for classical or other music that doesnt require a lot of bass. They would be perfect for that. Though, if you want to listen to hip hop or anything like that, I'd pass. Even when you turn up the bass on your equalizer, the base does not sound rich like it did with my previous Sony EX-71's. Granted the sounds on the Shure E2c's are of higher quality so I guess its your preference."
3,Enjoyed them until they broke,These buggers are a little big but I enjoyed the sound and the experience -- that is until the left earbud broke about a year after I purchased them. I am trying a different brand to replace them.
4,EC2 AND E2 MODELS ARE THE SAME EARPHONES,"I PURCHASED THESE EARPHONES FOR AROUND 72.00 US DOLLARS THINKING I WAS PURCHASING THE EC2 MODELS LIKE THE ONES YOU FIND IN THE MUSIC STORES, BUT TO MY SUPRISE THE BOX SAID SHURE E2 NOT EC2.WHEN I CALLED THE SHURE COMPANY THEY TOLD ME THEY WERE THE SAME EXACT THING, ITS ONLY THAT E2 MODEL NUMBERS ARE FOR REGULAR CONSUMERS AND THE EC2 MODEL NUMBERS ARE NORMALLY SOLD TO PROFESSIONAL MUSIC STORES ,BUT TRUST ME I WENT FOR MYSELF TO DOUBLE CHECK AND THEY (THE SHURE COMPANY) WHERE RIGHT, SAME THING WITH A DIFFRENT MODEL NUMBERS, BUT WHAT I DID NOTICE IS THAT YOU PAY FULL PRICE ALMOST EVERYWHERE FOR THE EC2 MODEL NUMBER ABOUT 99.00 US DOLLARS WHEN YOU CAN BUY THE E2 FOR AROUND 70.00 US DOLLARS (GO FIGURE).ALL AND ALL THEY ARE QUALITY EARPHONES THAT WILL PROBABLY LAST A LONG TIME, PLUS THEY COME WITH A 2 YEAR WARRENTY, NOT BAD!"
3,A bit indifferent,"Had heard all the rave reviews of this item, and was anxious to try them out. As it stands, my expectations were set a bit too high, as they do not measure up. Granted, they are good little earphones - but not as much a step up over other (cheaper) versions I've used, such as those by Sennheiser. Also, you really need to ensure a good, solid fit for the bass to kick in (as was expected). I give them three out of five stars."
4,Good for the money,"I replaced a pair of Sony MDREX70, simple in-ear type, headphones with these. I noticed an improvement in bass and overall sound quality. The sound isolation works pretty well."
1,Do Not Spend The Money,"I have used many earbuds in the past, and currently I am in the market for a new pair. I went to my local Best Buy and picked up Shure, Bose, and JBL earbuds. The Shure earbuds were the worst, they were uncomfortable and hard to fit. I have an Apple iPod and a SanDisk Sansa, and on both MP3 players I could not go over 1/2 volume. The earbuds would cut out, and sometimes not work at all. The factory buds were better then the Shure E2c. The JBL earbuds were the best. They were easy to fit, included great accessories, and had excellent build quality. Another pair of GREAT earbuds are the Bang and Olufsen. They are reasonable at $149.00 and are excellent quality. However, I would not recommend the Shure E2c to anyone!"
1,Impossible to fit,"I found this almost impossible to fit where they stayed in the ear for any time at all. Turn your head a few times, they pop out. Sound quality was superb, however."
2,Not the comfort I wanted at all,"I hear so many things about how great these shure headphones are but man, I had them for 3 days and my ears were hurting so much from the wear. I used the smallest settings as well, but I couldn't get the damn things to fit well enough with good sound.This may be just me or perhaps my ear canals are too small for this type of earphone but I was not happy at all with these highly praised earphones. I traded them in for some sennheiser HD 515 for the same price and absolutly love them. They are much much bigger, but my ears now feel great and the sound is wonderful."
1,"Good Name, Poor Sound","I've heard great things about Shure in the past, so I decided to buy a pair of the E2c ear buds. It took me more than 30 minutes to find a decent adapter so the buds would stay in my ear. After that, my ear was sore and they still didn't want to stay put. After putting them in, I connected my MP3 player to them and was terribly disappointed by the sound. The high frequencies were OK, but the mid and low tones were completely absent. I adjusted the EQ on my MP3 player and the sound was not improved. I'm not sure if these things just need to be placed inside of the ear, touching the ear drum, or they are not designed for full range sound.They are not worth the money and I'd not recommend this product. The case is also a piece of junk. The cord is not easily wound around to contain them. Very poor design, but I guess the size is the only good thing about it."
1,Give Me A Break!,"Where do I begin? Proper seal or not these things sound like 2 cans and a string (or worse). I tried ALL of the earpieces over a several hour period. And yes I read the instructions thoroughly. What a joke. Also they fall out of my ear no matter what position I use. Seldom have I seen a product so THOROUGHLY disappointing.This doesn't seem to be a popular review but I am telling you now that most of the people who gave these a good review don't sound convinced. I believe they are trying to justify a bad purchase to themselves. I am no stranger to quality audio and the E-2C has NO low end, NO mid-range and are THE MOST uncomfortable things you will ever pick up. If this is the kind of sound you like, I still think you would be happy with 2 cans and a string. It's much cheaper!"
1,Don't waste your money,"This thing is overpriced, yes, but if it works is ok, I though. Fact is, it does not work, unlesss you implant it in your ears. I found it very unconfortable and I could not have a refund because I don't live in the US, so I didn't even bother tryed to get it. Now it is another dust collector in my room, while I am using a very, very less expensive one."
1,"Don't buy them, they are not going to solve the problem and hurt ears.","First, outside sound isolation is minumal, you can hardly feel it. Second, they will hurt your ears in 10 minutes so badly that for the next 3 days you will not be able to put anything into your ears. I look at them as at monsters."
1,"Poor fit, poor bass","I spent over an hour trying all the different sleeves but could not get a good fit. The best fit was when I pushed and held them with my fingers, and still the bass wasn't as good as the standard ear buds that come with an Ipod. Some may get a good fit but unfortunately I couldn't, so I returned them."
2,not worth the high price,"I sent these back and exchanged for a $30 pair of earbuds that produce what I think is actually better sound quality (the creative ep-630, which are great for the $30 price tag). The way you put these e2c's in your ear is very awkward. The only good thing about these is the solid cord and the variety of earbuds."
3,great sound but...,"great sound but real hard to keep in ears, I ve tried all the adapters, I struggle with it but I do have weird shaped ears"
3,Think twice about buying other Shure products.,"I have bought two pairs of Shure e2, they're awesome the first time you tried them they're great if you're planing to use it as In-ear monitors, great if you want them to use it with your Ipod.Great sound, and a quite good isolation.The downside is the cord! Such an fragile cord.take a look to what happened after some use to both of my e2c.That's why I bought some super fi.5 pro they're better ! believe me!! MORE Isolation! More Sound!and the best part the cord is detachable so if your cord gets cut you just buy another one! I agree it's alittle expensive! $0.00 but at least It's cheaper thatn buying other earphones."
2,Not Worth The Money,"For $100 I was expecting Awsome earphones, but the base is horible! I bought them form my Ipod while working out. They stay in my ears better, but the sound quality of the standard issue Ipod earphones was a lot better. The E2c would probably work well for podcasts, but for music with any base at all, they are a big disapointment."
2,Keep Looking,"I really wanted to like these earbuds. Really. On the positive side they are comfortable to wear and are well made. The problem is that the sound they produce is sub-par for what they cost. In fact, I was shocked at thin quality of the sound that they produced as well as the lack of bass response. The sound is clear but certainly not worth the price. I had a pair of Sonys that I wanted to replace for comfort and improved sound reasons. Unfortunately, though the Shures were far more comfortable the sound, particularly the bass, was very disappointing. And, yes, I did try several combinations of earpieces to get a good seal in my ear canal. I returned these and will keep looking for other contenders."
3,Very Noise Cancelling,"These are some serious ear buds. They really do sound great, but they definitely cancel any sound. They are basically ear plugs. I bought them to use with a in-ear monitor system for a band. I am the drummer and when wearing them I couldn't even hear myself. If we had the drums mic'd, this probably would have been a problem... but they are not. So not hearing yourself is normally not a good thing.So, I sold them to the keyboardist. They occasionally fall out so for performance you better make sure you have them in good before you start. Other than that, pretty high quality."
2,Good headphones LOUSY chord,"The sound is very good, however the chord quality, especially where it meets the earbuds are very poor in quality. The chord will get brittle in cold tempertures and eventually will crack, exposing the wire, and then break eventually. Given the high price of Shure headphones, this is unacceptable.Good luck in trying to get Shure to listen to the customer complaints when describing the problem with their product.Furthermore, the inner ear plug, does not lock into position, and is easily lost. Replacements are only available through Shure at a ridiculous high price (Something that is worth literally 10 cents in material is sold for 10 dollars.Good sound, but a faulty product design therefore ultimately a waste of money."
5,Love them so far..,"I got a smokin' deal on these earphones ($34) and I'm very pleased so far. Just the other day I was telling a friend that I've never come across a pair of earphones which fit in my ears properly. I had always blamed my ear lobe anatomy, whereas if I moved in the slightest they'd fall out! But these fit perfectly (I use the small, flexible black ear pieces)! Also, they block sound admirably. I only have two minor complaints: 1.) the sound quality's great, but not superb, and 2.) they're a little uncomfortable (i.e., pressure). Anyways...I'd recommend them to anyone who's given up on earphones in the past, give them a try!"
2,"Much better than standard, but not great","These were on sale when I bought them, marked down to $50 from $100. They are vastly better than the stock earbuds I was using, I will admit. I actually kinda liked them, until I did some research and picked up a pair of Sennheiser CX300's for 65 bucks. Compared to the Sennheisers, the Shure E2C's sound horrible, like the difference between the Shures and the cheapest earphones you can buy. For an extra few bucks, you can have vastly better sound quality with the Sennheisers."
2,Breaks,"The sound is very good and is almost comfortable. However, between me and my roommate, we have gone through 8 pairs of these (I bought one he bought 3 the rest warranty replacement) they all break. the wire over the ear cracks no matter what you do. they all fail within 12 months. shure has 2 year warranty so they'll send you a new one the first time it breaks but the second time you'll be out of warranty and they want you to buy a new one.I would love to use shure but I am looking for a different brand now because I can't afford to spend >$100 on headphones every 10 months. if anyone has any recommendations drop in the comments. section."
2,"nice design, but thats about it","Quick rundown:Nice fit in the ears, but only when wrapping cord up and over the lobe.Sound is awful...like it's in a tin-can, use caution when purchasing to make sure you can return."
2,Uncomfortable,The earphones were very uncomfortable. Even the small ear cushions were uncomfortable. The spongy inserts were so compressed upon arrival that they did not expand to block exterior noise. The wires were so stiff that they were difficult to route over the ear for security.
3,Bad coating,"I like the Shure E2C earphones overall. But, in cold weather, the stiff plastic coating over the cord cracks. I take good care of them, and wear them according to instructions. Shure replaced them once for the same problem, but out of warranty and you're out of luck. It's a design flaw that Shure should fix. I'm not going to buy Shure again."
4,E2c earbuds,"If you're a bass freak... these aren't for you. I took me a few tries to get the right fit. I'm not ALL about bass, but I do like a nice EQ'd sound and these are a very 'flat' sounding. So they're good for studio use and live stage monitors, but not for Ipods."
2,Quality Control Issues,"I bought these earphones about a year and a half ago, and they worked pretty well putting aside that it hurt my ears and the bass was relatively low. Additionally, these are sound isolating - not noise cancelling - earbuds. About 5 months in, the right ear gave out and crinkly static replaced the clear sound. Because my earphones were still under warranty, I sent them back, and to my delight a new pair was sent to me! But after only ONE month, the left ear gave out completely. What a disappointment. I appreciate Shure's satisfaction guarantee, I just don't think it's worth it to spend any more time or money sending broken pairs back and fourth. It's time to move on and find a different pair all together."
3,3 Stars Compared to the Bose,"I received these headphones recently as a gift. My initial experience was positive. I've decided to only give the E2c's three stars only after listening to my friend's Bose In-Ear Headphones. In my opinion, the Bose have a much deeper base response and, in comparison, make my E2c's sound 'tinny'. The E2c's are also more difficult to fit properly in the ear. Lastly, I do not like having to wrap the cords from the buds around my ears. In my opinion, if you're undecided between the Bose and the E2c's, I'd go with the Bose...particularly since they are priced equally."
5,Highly Recommended,"I'm not sure where all these negative reviews are coming from, but I bought mine about 9 months ago. After daily use, I found that these were extremely high quality for the price. The bass output isn't amazing, but the highs and mids more than make up for it. The quality sounds natural, letting you hear every detail of a certain song without having to max out the volume. If you want more bass, turn up the lows on the equalizer. Make sure the earbuds fit right and you won't be dissapointed."
3,"So far, not great","I've just tried to use my new Shure E2 series sound canceling earphones.I've tried all the earpieces. None of them fit securely in my ear. None of them ""cancel"" the room noise. (I usually have the room as quiet as I can for transcribing, but left the TV on to see. Nope, I hear everything quite clearly.)I figured, okay, give it a trial anyway, turned off the TV sound, began to transcribe,and at the first turn of my head, the things popped out. I could have saved $81 and stuck with my little Radio Shack set, which also don't cancel out the sound and also occasionally fall out."
4,Shure E2C - So good it's scary,"I just got these earphones and they are very different than I thought they would be. Don't get me wrong - I love them. I live in Manhattan and was not ready for the change that would happen when I put these guys in my ears. Basically I can't hear anything but the music. I'm missing subway stops, almost getting hit by cars. People talk to me and all I see is lip flap. I'm in my own little music world walking around scared that something is going to happen that I can't hear. Like: ""Hey look out, watch your head!"" Or ""Hey look out for the taxi it's gonna hit you!"" But when it's a good song I don't seem to care... Unless the subway decides to go express and I end up on Delancy street. Anyway - the sound is awesome. It does take some time getting used to the them in your ear - but so far, so good."
4,Takes some getting used to..,"But it's worth it! At first I was hesitant on these earbuds until I read the reviews. I've had these for almost a year now, and I love them. When you first get them, you need to experiment which size and style you prefer. Once you get used to putting them on and feeling comfertable with them you will be able to enjoy your music to the max. Remember, these aren't going to be instantly gratifying unless you have some experience with these type of earphones."
2,Just didn't fit,I picked these up on a Gold Box special for $40. Figured it was worth a shot at that price.Pros:* They do cancel the noise. Not quite as nice as the Bose but the price was much better. I couldn't hear anyone outside my office as I usually do. The 2 stars was for this.Cons:* The overall sound quality was poor.* I tried all the different earpieces and found all of them to be very uncomfortable. I cannot imagine wearing them for any extended period of time.So I sent mine back. I guess I will have to give up on in-the-ear earphones.
5,comfortable!,"I use my earbuds primarily at work, so I needed a set with a longer cord so I can move around. I have tried 3 different sets of earbuds from the big box stores and either the sound quality was poor, the cord was too short, or they just kept popping out of my ears. The E2C's have all the good things I was looking for. Most importantly, they are comfortable in my ears and don't pop out. As other have said, the bass leaves something to be desired. I tried all of the adapters that came with the E2C's and for me, I find that the soft black rubber sleaves fit best in my ear and give the best bass sound with the way it seals the ear canal. I am looking forward to trying these on the airplane next week and see how well the sound isolation works."
4,Nice earphones!,"First, let me say that these do not block all sound. Secondly, let me say that there are the best headsets I've bought yet and I've bought about 5. They worked really well on my last flight, I could actually hear on the plane without too much outside noise. I will be buying my kids a set, they are really pretty good."
2,Not impressed at all,I've had these earbuds for about 3 weeks now and I'm highly disappointed. Where's the bass with these things? I've tried putting on the orange foam buds but the bass is still lacking and I have to jam them halfway into my ear canal to get decent bass at best. Not to mention the foam gets dirty after about a week. Highly overpriced and overrated.I'll stick with my Sony and Skull Candy earbuds
3,SHURE E2C SOUND ISLATING EAR PHONES,"The sound is above average, but the fit to your ear needs to be im proved"
2,Not Worth It,"These were uncomfortable, even at the smallest included size, for more than 30 minutes or so, especially if you chew gum, eat, or yawn a lot with them in place.Also, even with a proper seal, the bass was not very deep. My apologies to all of the people that worship this product.Lastly, my product was defective; one side was about 50% louder than the other. I was able to adjust this using the player's balance setting, but with my other problems with the item, I just returned them. This had no effect on my rating.They were able to tune out surrounding noise, though, -- similar to a pair of uncomfortable earplugs -- and did produce sound! That's why they get two stars."
3,Great sound,I gave the low rating because it would really be easy for them to label right and left ear instead of making me read the manual and remember which model I have. Once you get the fit right they are awesome.
1,like a rich musical experience? don't buy these.,"these earbuds have no low end, period. i liked the fit and finish but sent them right back after a few minutes of listening to them on my ipod. i am by no means an audiophile but do know that my music has a low end, i want to hear it. i ordered koss ""plugs"", $20, and they blow these $100 timewasters away. other reviewers talk about getting used to them or the seal in the ear canal needed to hear the low end. well, being silicone these seal much better than the koss plugs but that only amplifies the weak, tinny sound. skip these."
1,Over-priced and over-hyped,"I bought these headphones after reading multiple positive reviews on the product. I was looking for a solid headphone performer in the $75-$100 range, and these came out on top. I thought I was upgrading from my $25 Phillips headphones by purchasing but was wrong. The Sure E2c sound is flat, as if I was listening to music through a tin can. There is absolutely NO bass response, which is disappointing. Furthermore, the earphones tend to fall out of my ears rather easily because none of the ear pieces provided fit. They are either too big or too small. The design is difficult to keep in the ear because they are curved at an awkward angle. I am very disappointed in these headphones and now have wasted money on them because I can't return opened headphones. I would steer clear of these earphones; if you are curious, try them out first. I'm going to stick with my Phillips headphones. What a disappointment."
1,"tinny sound, deceptive labeling","These sound terrible and are difficult to put in. The instructions (not I) say it's essential to form an airtight seal in the ear in order to hear the bass frequencies properly. I.e. shove the things in until they are snug like those foam earplugs you buy at concerts.Shoving ANY kind of earbud in deeper makes the bass sound deeper; but I don't think quality earphones would rely on this principle. Since I don't like to cram foam cylinders deep into my ear, and since the sound is still inferior to iPod standard earbuds, these have slid to back of my kitchen junk drawer."
2,hurt my ears,"Sound great, but they are so heavy that they hurt my ears. Also, they are different sized than the E1s, E3s and E5s, so they take different foam sizes.Get the E3s."
2,disapointing!!!,"I bought a zen micro, which by the way blows ipods out of the water, and found that the earbuds which sounded fantastic, were uncomfortable, and hurt my ears, so on recomendations, and reading reviews, tried the sure E2's. I found on the comfort leval a 10, but was shocked to find out that the stock earbuds sounded so much better than these $100 earphones! It was like comparing AM to FM, the shure's being the AM! The sound was all mid range, and not much in base tones, the clairity was great, but that was about it. I guess I expected too much, so needless to say, I'm returning these, and trying something else, or keeping the creative earphones."
1,where's the bass,I purchased these headphones after two pairs of Bose stopped working. Bose offer a much better sound quality. Listening to my songs through these headphones have wiped out the bass completely. I almost don't recognize the songs on my IPOD. I'm seriously disappointed.
2,Uncomfortable and lacking warmth,After reading the many reviews suggesting that this headset was great I bought a pair for myself.I found the earbuds very uncomfortable and did not like the pressure it caused on the inside of my ear. I also found that there was way too much high end and not enough bass response. I found the sound to be way to harsh.I'm an audio producer so I plugged these earphones into everything from an i-pod to a hi-end studio system with same results.After a couple of days trying to get used to these earphones I tossed them for the Philips Surround earphones which are much more comfortable and sound very warm.
1,Worse Than Cheap Earphones,This was a complete waste of money. I feel absolutely ripped off. These earphones have ZERO bass and won't stay in the ear. I can't imagine why this company has a good reputation. I had to throw them in storage and I am back to using my $15 cheap earphones.
2,Where are my earphones?,"I ordered these on September 17th. Twice now, I've received e-mails from Amazon saying shipping was delayed. NOW they're expected to be delivered in late December!! And to make things even worse, Amazon now won't let me cancel my order like I had the opportunity to do in the first e-mail which was sent in the beginning of October. Although the price was right (39.99 & free shipping), buyer beware of a deal to good to be true.UPDATE: 1 day after writing this, I received an e-mail from Amazon saying my Shures had shipped and should be arriving by October 25th. Stay Tuned!"
4,Good phones but...,"These ear phones are great at isolating outside noise and the sound is far better than any standard iPod set. However, I have had mine for 14 or 15 months and the wire casing (especially around my ear) has bent and cracked open, leaving the copper wiring exposed. Because of this, the connection is failing, ruining the sound. I may buy another pair unless I find something more durable."
2,Broke 3 times before warranty was up,"I got these in part because of the warranty. Mine broke 3 times during the 2 year warranty period and each time Shure replaced them, but I had no headphones for two weeks. Each time they broke, I got a new pair in sealed packaging, so I think that these headphones just break a lot, which is surprising considering how sturdy they feel. The warranty just ended and they broke again, not buying another pair."
5,Best Earphones Ever,"Ever stopped and thought about how much you love your ipod? Sure you have. After a week of use, you'll begin to develop a similar fondness for these earphones. They block out all exterior noise, they're extremely comfortable, and the sound quality is supreme. These are the best earphones on the market - do yourself a favor and get them."
4,"comfortable, but a bit bright.","these earphones are my first foray into the ""stick them in your ear canal"" buds. i'm a bit disappointed. these definitely do not produce enough bottom end - not that that is the lone determinant of good sound. for listening around the house, i'll probably stick to my sennheiser px-100's (my overall favorites) and my grado sr-60's. while working out, i'll use my cheap sony buds because they are cheap (i wouldn't care if they broke) and these shure's block out a bit too much noise for things like running and cycling - you really can't hear anything around you. while travelling (especially on airplanes), i'll use these shure's. i was hoping that these would be perfect for everything, so i'm a bit disappointed, but they are still pretty good, especially considering the price i paid."
2,Not as good as they say,"Based upon all the reviews i read, I couldnt wait to get these ear buds. I must completely disagree with the rave reviews. I could not have been more disappointed. When I took them to the gym the first day, they kept falling out of my ears. alas, i did not take the time to properly fit them to my ears. Soo back home i went, and sat for 30 minutes adjusting the different fittings. nada. i mean not even close. I could not find a comfort fitting. they never did fit snugly, and quite fankly, all i could think was..this is a lot of work for a dopey pair of earbuds. when i finally got a ""decent"" fit, the sound was nothing special. a bit weak on the low end. high end a bit harsh. Just an overall negative experience for me, so back they go to amazon..and i am back to my ipod buds. to each his own i guess."
4,So Far So Good,"I just got these earphones and enjoy them quite well. They seem to be well made and after some experimenting I found that the light plastic sleeves are most comfortable and allow enough ambient noise so I don't feel too isolated from my environment. ONE IMPORTANT NOTE: The instructions that came with my earphones had a critical error. They said that the black and white earphone was for the left hear, but it is for the right ear. I discovered this from the Shure website. This makes a huge difference, they aren't very comfortable and don't work as well in the wrong ears."
5,Ideal for audio books!,"I was reluctant to spend much money on a ""standard"" set of earphones, but having wasted quite a bit of money on two high-end noise-canceling earphones, I decided to give the E2c a try. I wish I'd discovered these two years ago - these things are silence in your ears. They block out nearly all the external sound; depending on how you fit them into your ear, you can arrange them so that you'll hear what you want.I use earphones for commuting, exercising and hiking. The E2c excels at all three. With audio books loaded, I can listen to the softest narrator over the sounds of the loudest subway noise. In the gym, I don't have to listen to bad hip-hop blaring through a tinny PA system. When hiking, I can wear these things for six hours with no discomfort.I don't bother with the case included. They roll up much smaller and take up very little space in a pocket.Highly recommended."
4,Shure E2 Noise Redcuction Headphones,"These headphones work pretty well. The sound is good. It has a flaw in that they require earwax shields. When thse fill up, the units stop working. The shields cost $10 for 10. They are a pain to put on. When the headphones are in your ear they go fairly deep into the canal. This is how they reduce noise. I would buy these again despite the earwax shields. If you can't handle the shields then I'd pass."
4,"Good earphones, but could be greeatly improved.","These earphones have decent sound quality, with a slight lack of bass, and are a secure fit once inserted properly. The sound reduction is not very good with any of the supplied tips, and is nearly completely useless in reducing the sound of wind. I would say that, at best, these are good for 12 decibels of reduction, but with music playing, that is really all that is necessary. I can still hear the rumbling of buses and that awful noise during flights, but it is reasonably quiter, and with a good set of earmuffs over them, it is great. The sound is good, it avoids the tinny sound, yet lacks any form of decent bass. Overall, I would not spend $80 to replace these should they go bad, but I have tested a set of e5c's and would definately buy those and get the custom molded inserts from an audiologist if I have to fly more often than I currently do."
2,"No Bass, ok sound isolation, but doesn't beat my old noise cancellation headphones","I was disappointed, partly because of how expensive they are. It just has no low range. Period. I could understand if there was a low range, but not a very good one, but this had nothing."
5,Great headphones,"These sound great. I love that I don't have to worry about batteries like sound ""cancelling"" headphones. These are a must for long flights, these work great to block out the airplane noise, I wish they came with a double pronged jack for airplanes. I have had once or twice where the inline audio control would have been nice because they work so well that low on my airplane armrest wasn't low enough. Since they are noise blocking I can turn my ipod down further than with other headphones making my battery last longer which is also great for traveling. Great sound and great build quality."
2,Great but don't last,"Second pair that has broken. I take care of them, but I think the chord is just too sensitive."
2,Over hyped,"I bought these head phones a couple years ago. They have failed on me 3 times in all. The part that failed was the mini jack that you plug into your player (mp3/cd/etc). While Shure honored their warranty, they never did anything about the fact that their product kept failing at the same place twice.Iver all i didnt like the fact that the headphones were too big and heavy. The 3 different sizes ear fittings offered by Shure didnt fit my ear (my ears are smaller then the Shure avg).Would I buy them again? Nope, in general I'm staying away from this brand."
3,Problems using with iPod Nano,"The sound quality of these earbuds was terrific, but I ended up returning them because I lost about half the volume potential of my iPod Nano. I also did not find the earbuds as comfortable as others I own. A more minor problem was that I couldn't use the hard plastic case I have for the Nano because of the size and L-shape of the earbuds' plug. And their clamshell packaging gets the all time award for being hardest to open."
5,Exactly what I wanted.,"These headphones are exactly what I wanted. They're small, comfortable (thanks to shipping with an assortment of differently sized buds), and block out outside noise without using active noise cancellation. The sound quality is very good as well."
5,Shure monitor earphones E2c,"For the money...you cannot do much better for passive noise reduction. After all, shure is the manufacturer of higher quality equipment recognized in the music industry. I can mow the lawn and use these headphones as ear plugs with the ability to listen to music from a great pair of earphones and I do not need high volume to achieve this. What a concept."
3,Sound quality,"I used these earbuds with an Ipod touch and I have to say that I thought the original iPod ear buds sounded better - particularly with repsect to bass. However, on a plane, these ear buds shut out a great deal of the engine noise and I was able to hear music much better than with the ipod earbuds. So - good for planes, not so good for day to day use.Tech support by the way was very good!"
4,Shure I like them,"After getting used to putting them in my ears, I am quite pleased with the sound quality. It is more treble than base, which I like because I listen to podcasts. I don't like the little sticky you have to apply over the earpiece to block ear wax from getting in. they should have attached a small metal mesh there instead. The rubber cups are comfortable but a little hard to get off and on to clean."
3,Good not great headphones,These are a good purchase and worth the price. Still not the base bass I was hoping but I'm happy. If you have the standard ipod headphones and want to step it up notch this is def the way to go though.
3,Not bad...Not the best,"I have:ipod nano Gen 3, iAudio U2 and U3.I compared them across all three. I also used every configuration of earphone sleeve that was supplied and found the optimum sleeves for my ears.My experience:I like that they do isolate so I can listen at lower volume.They are clearly, without effort, far superior to the stock ipod headphones.Unfortunately, they aren't as clear or as bass-ey as the V-Moda Vibes or even the stock iAudio earbuds.That said...I will still be using these preferentially because of their ability isolate and their comfortable fit.In Summary:Better than ipod stock earbuds (no revelation there), surprisingly not as good sounding as stock iAudio earbuds in sound (to my ear) but far more comfortable."
3,Good sound - bad design,I read good reviews and decided to try it.. sounds great but the fact that i have to loop it behind my ear everytime i put it on and take it off drove me insane. Its too inconvenient so I returned it. Just not for me. Bought the Vibes instead..
3,a little uncomfortable,"Even with the smallest earbuds, it takes some time to get used to. Also, it seems to amplify some noise while moving - cable rubbing to clothes or something like that...It's quite good blocking external sound...."
4,Very good earphones,"There were a lot of negative reviews on these earbuds, so I was skeptical. The sound quality is quite good, and the noise isolation is also very good if you have them in all the way. Problem is they pop out just slightly very easily and the wires are annoying when they're still stiff from being brand new. Lots of people also say the bass is terrible, and that's not true, but again, they do have to be completely in before you can really hear it. I'm no audiophile, so these earphones suit me perfectly fine. They're a lot better than my last ones in any case."
2,Sound half good,After some very meticulous shopping I decided on the Shure E2c Earphones. My first problem was that the supplier shipped a different model with no real explanation for the difference or the spec difference between the units. My second problem was with the earphones themselves. Right out of the packaging I was disappointed to discover that only one channel worked. Almost nothing from the right channel unless I had the volume level at full and then it was only barely audible. I tried the earphones with various sound systems with same result. Called Shure and they told me to return them for a replacement set. This review will be continued. The left side seemed to sound just fine but I am concerned with Shure's quality control. How difficult can it be to verify sound coming from both channels in a set of earphones before you package them up in an impenetrable plastic shield? I expected more from such a renowned company.
5,Good Value,"Great Product, well worth the price.Recommendation. Learn how to put them in, it will make sense once you have, and it will improve sound quality.I used the foam surrounds, which work well for my small ear canals.Excellent sound quality."
3,Bad Fit For Small Aars,"For me these were just too uncomfortable for my small ears. Even with the smallest ear cups. Because I could never get them in my ear I was never able to tell whether the sound quality was all it was cracked up to be. I personally prefer Sony's Phontopias. They fit, They sound good enough for the use they get and they were very affordable."
4,Shure E2c Sound Isolating Earphones,"I like the changealbe inner ear piece. I have always had issues with other in ear headphones. They make my ear sore after a while. They are kind of bulky and can work themselves out of the ear if you are sweating and do not have the cord draped over and then behind the ear. There is an a little disposable circle piece to prevent wax from entering the earphone. So far I have replaced it once. The circle cover has a bit of an adhesive to stick to the earphone. It stays in place well, but I am a little disappointed that I will have to find a buy more during the time I own these earphones. I have no idea where to buy them or how much they cost. Hopefully they are cheap. The noise cancelloing feature works well enough to get rid of background noise of conversations on airplanes and the engine noise too. I put the earphone in even when I can not have the MP3 powered up during takeoff and landing. I would not recommend them for use at a nascar race."
4,Great headphones but....,"After getting a new Microsoft Zune, I had to replace the crap headphones. I did that by choosing the Shure e2c sound isolating headphones. I've had them for about 4 months and they are great. The bass is just right and the treble is perfect. I actually noticed things in my music that i've never noticed before! Theirs only one problem. One day I was wearing the headphones, I had pushed the ear piece farther in my ear to hear it better (it was falling out of my ear) anyways... the ear piece fell off in my ear. It was so far down that I had to go to the emergency room to get it taken out. I am now switching to eather the Sennheiser PX100's or the AKG K26P's (over the ear headphones.. Overall the product was great, despite the fact to what happend to my ear."
3,somewhat disappointing,"The earplugs took some getting used to but eventually were a snug fit in my ear. Overall, the sound quality is great but definitely low on bass, which is truly disappointing as other similar products do outdo it. Sturdy construction and great design. In general, a great ear phone but not the best."
1,Shure review - not great,"I bought this pair for running and was SOOOO annoyed that they would not stay in my ears. I tried all 3 different sizes, wedged them in, etc. Throughout my runs, I would have to hold them in. The only plus is the sound. I eventually splurged for the Bang and Olufsen...the best ever!!"
1,"""Ultimate Music Experience"" - Ultimate Disappointment!","It sounded too good to be true - studio component earphones on sale at half-price! I read the positive reviews and the caveats pertaining to getting the buds to fit properly, but after carefully following the directions and trying all of the bud sizes, I was still unable to get a snug fit. The ear pieces continually slipped out of my ears, and when I could get a temporary good fit, the sound quality was akin to having a bad head cold. While walking, my breathing competed with the sound of music, as well as the sound of each of my steps as my feet pounded the pavement. The wires are too heavy and cumbersome. It was difficult to keep the wires behind my ears while wearing sunglasses. It comes as no surprise that Shure discontinued this poorly designed product. I enjoy better sound quality with my IPod earphones and none of the hassles experienced with the Shure E2c."
3,Fairly disappointing,"I could not accept the possible hype surrounding these and returned them. Bass is often the issue with earbuds. Many Sony's are too bassy, but these do not supply adequate bass regardless of fit. As for fit, it is not at all intuitive, and I personally do not accept the ""looping of the cord over the top of your ears"". The cord does not easily stay in that position and when it slips, sound is adversely affected. The supplied options of tips for the ear canal is a good assortment. Mid-range is a bit honky or nasally, treble was good."
2,"No bass, ok sound isolation, but doesn't beat my old noise cancellation headphones","This definitely does not have full range. Some songs I listen to have very low base frequencies. I would have been fine if I could hear it, but it was quieter. That's what I was expecting. To my surprise, entire bass lines were completely absent from the songs when listened to through these E2s. And the sound isolation is something I'm new to. I've been using old AIWA noise cancellation headphones, which work better. Whether you want isolation or cancellation, my bet is that there's a much better product for the price, and I intend to find it."
4,Stimulation for the mind,"The book actually lives up to the reviews printed in the few pages. Daniel Gilbert explains how the brain works in such an entertaining way that you feel good about being smarter or more informed for finishing the book. It isn't even that long, so it's definitely something you could re-read if you like and gain a better understanding and appreciation for how and why you and other people act and think the way they do. And you'll get to learn about stuff you may not have even known you are curious about."
4,"The psychology, biology, science, and art of happiness...","Consider two real life stories...one lives in misery, is unfairly accused of crime, and is hanged to death. The other is a wealth creator, builds a huge empire, generates huge economic output, and creates many jobs. Which life would you rather live? If you think you know, think again...and read this book!It is about the psychology, biology, science, and art of happiness and the author has done a wonderful job developing his framework for understanding human happiness and assembling together the details in a style that is very easy to read, but does not trivialize the subject."
2,Disappointing,"The good news is that Gilbert has a lot of good and occasionally humorous material about how our minds work. He uses mental biases and errors to illustrate our mental processes and understand their limitations. However, if you've read even a few popular books on neurobiology and the mind, you already know much of this and have seen many of the examples.While the book has received a lot of hype, I was disappointed mostly in the weakness of his conclusions about happiness. The conclusions derive in large part from studies about whether you can anticipate how happy or sad you will be after eating ice cream, eating potatio chips, or losing a pizza. My key disappointment arose because I do not see that studies about momentary feelings of happiness tell us anything interesting about the pursuit of happiness as the longer term sense of life satisfaction and well being that most of us are interested in."
5,Well written exploration of human thinking,"How do we tend to project our future? What influences one's feeling of happiness now and later? How accurate are our memories? Questions such as these are answered with humor and clarity. The book is divided into six main sections: prospection, subjectivity, realism, presentism, rationalization and corrigibility.For anyone seeking greater knowledge on the short comings of human thinking and alerting us to common pitfalls of our day to day thinking this book is well worth reading."
2,Owner for 2 years and still haven't finished,"I have to admit I've really struggled to finish this book...in fact after many attempts, I've barely made it through half. The book is a bit trite and was not intriguing enough to hold my attention!"
2,Impressive but drags beyond the message,"I picked up the book on a pure whim while entertaining 'the secret' and current wave of self help books. The book contains many valid conclusions and eye opening statements but they are unfortunately overshadowed by the repetitiveness through the chapters. The author illustrates his points by providing countless studies (along with humorless puns) that make the book seem long to read. I would've appreciated a more concise book on the subject matter delivering the message along with its scientific evidence without beating it out over and over again. I wouldn't recommend the book, as you will get the point half way through and put it down."
1,Not so good book,"I agree with all of the one star reviews. The author doesn't have a clue about happiness. He recounts studies about memory and judgement. All of these studies or most of them should be familier to anyone who has taken a psychology class in college. He dismisses Aristotle in the space of less than a page, setting his ethics up as a straw man and blowing him down. He does not know anything about philosophy. He drops a few names, but otherwise pretty much ignores philosophy. What we get instead are several recountings of psychological experiments and no cohesive or overarching theory to tie them together. I know no more about happiness than I did before I read the book. And his humor is forced and unfunny. Better to buy a psychology text book for college freshmen than this."
2,Verbose,"The ""Publishers Weekly"" review for this book on Amazon provides a succinct and very accurate synopsis of the book...that's all you need to read. The book is a laundry-list of examples that support the less than novel or astute conclusions by the author. Verbose and self-congratulatory.His anthrophocentric views are cliche, not to mention offensive. His easy dismissal of animal intelligence, denigrating their limited ""nexting"" capacity when compared to the grandeur of the human imagination , indicates that he is very ignorant of animal behavior...and failed to use his much touted human imagination to perceive their intelligence. He needs only to study a cat for a week to see that animals have the capacity to feel what we do. Cats can hold personal grudges that exemplify intelligence and imagination beyond his dismissive ""nexting."""
2,Somewhat useless information,"Five male reviewers are quoted on the back jacket of this book, all giving it fairly glowing comments. Perhaps I didn't find it interesting because I'm female?It gets two stars for all the clever, humorous meanderings Dr. Gilbert uses to move his dry subject matter along. It's fairly amazing to me that the subject of happiness can be that unintersting, but it is. I'm sure Dr. Gilbert is fun at parties, and I bet he can cheer up sick people quite well; but, as an author, he did not succeed in telling me anything useful. I can't recall one paragraph when he took this data and sculpted it into something pragmatic."
1,On sale,"I stumbled on/upon this book at the tail end of my local Borders-going-out-of-business sale. I paid about $1 for it. That's about what it's worth. The author is clearly a bright guy who reads a lot of ""research studies."" But, as I was plodding through the book looking for new insights, I found few. The author is quite invested in being both smart (look at all my footnotes!) and funny (I'll pull off a witticism roughly every other sentence, no matter how tedious the reference material!), and the result was actually quite a snore-fest."
2,Disappointing and Overrated,"This would better be titled ""Dissecting Happiness."" Gilbert spends a lot of time and effort giving us scientific data to give us evidence of basic principals most of us already know. It is a tedious read trying to follow the details of one ridiculous study or experiment of human behavior after the next! I never realized the time and money psychologists and socioligists are spending (and wasting) to dissect human behovior! While there were some interesting findings to explain why we have a hard time finding happiness, this book lacks a grand perspective, as well as any magic or inspiration. I was disappointed."
4,Are You Really Looking For Happiness?,You don't really wind up being so happy that you run around in a sunny field of flowers. You do walk away getting one truth to what makes us feel the happiness emotion from a pragmatic standpoint. Many people are searching for the answer to happiness and this is worth reading to gain a new perspective. It is a complex emotion just like all the others. It takes work and is not just handed out to a select few. Yes we control it. Sometimes we have a little head start just like tall men make more money but in the end you can use your own strengths to find where your own happiness lives. Or find out that you are really looking for something else.
2,can't remember,"I read this awhile back and now I can't remember what it said, other than the cover of the book was sexier than the dry studies inside."
3,From a psychologists view,"This book was more of a psychology study presentation than a ""how to find happiness"" book. I think I was expecting the latter more than the former. The material is presented well and the author does keep some rather dry material entertaining with personal anecdotes. I recently read Daniel Kahneman's Thinking, Fast and Slow and there are numerous similarities between these books. The studies discussed, the decision processes we use in daily life and other material. I didn't really expect the ""answer"" to happiness but was hoping. Really, you just have to figure it out for yourself."
2,Superficial- more like a undergraduate project,Didn't appear to have any personal insights or results of personal research. Regurgitation of other people's research/ observations without apology
2,Say what?,"Imagine having a fun Psych professor who is lecturing you on a bunch of clever studies about how people dont really know what they want. If that sounds like fun, then you will enjoy this book. The author has a clever style of presentation and a clear thesis. But the studies are loosely reported, and only indirectly support his point since they often were designed to show something else. He shusses over that and other details with his clever comments. Will you learn how to be happy from this book? No. Will you learn why you arent happy? No. Will you learn anything about happyness? Yes something, but it will be hard to say what."
5,One of the most enjoyable pieces of non-fiction,"I grabbed this to learn more about the psychological foundations of ""happiness"" and found out a lot about what ""vision"" has to do with leadership. Good read for people interested in psychology and who like non-fiction. Gilbert has a way to make you laugh out loud in the process."
3,Misleading title,This is a great book on decision-making and judgment and very accurate (I am a recent neuroscience graduate). But it is the most depressing book on happiness I have ever read. Gilbert's tone struck me as incredibly pessimistic and he leaves out all the wonderful studies in positive psychology that tell us exactly how to be happy.
3,An engaging read,"Written in the same light and engaging style asFreakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everythingby Steven Levitt andBlink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinkingby Malcom Gladwell, Gibert introduces the idea that what we things that make us happy really doesn't. We, as humans, spend a lot of time focusing on and preparing for some moment in the future in which we will be ""happy."" His thesis, that even though we engage in this activity (consciously and unconsciously), and attempt to control that future, we don't know who we will be or what we will be feeling then, so how can we prepare for and predict what will make us happy then.An interesting and somewhat thought-provoking read."
4,Interesting Topic,"This book was very interesting and gave a new perspective on how human's think, perceive, believe and know. It sheds light on why we make the decisions we make and how our ""view"" and what we think is the ""truth"" influence those decisions. At times, a tough read... but I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book."
5,The exploration of happiness,"If you are looking for an in-depth exploration of humanities involvement with happiness, this is a surprisingly broad resource. Mr. Gilbert's narrative style slips you through the normally dry research of the human physiological and psychological experience with entertaining ease. Let go of expectations to find happiness and enjoy the story of man's pursuit of that end."
5,We think we know depression and we really don't know happiness,"This is an excellent book by a skilled and funny writer. If you would like to get away from the negativity of the pop psychology of depression and learn more positive behaviors and happiness, put the antidepressant vial away and open the book.Also, if you get a chance to hear Daniel Gilbert speak, go. Take notes. Steal his jokes."
5,Book review,An interesting book with some unusual concepts. I expected to find a roadmap to happiness but instead found some fairly complicated thinking on how the brain perceives and stores information. It also apparently is guilty of tricking you into remembering things differently than the real event. I always wondered how witnesses to an event could see the same things so differently. This may explain it!
3,Disappointing,"Although interesting, the writing was not cohesive and so, after time spent, there was the sense that no depth of insight had been gained. Previous reviews had given the author much credit. Perhaps a final chapter with the few solid points brought together would have been more satisfying."
4,Easy to read and enlightening book!,"After seeing the author speak recently at a conference I decided that if the book was half as entertaining as the author's presentation then it would be worth the price of purchasing it and I was not disappointed. The book focuses on how we develop and envision our future happiness and why it is that reaching our future goals so often fails to meet our own expectations. The book provides fantastically simply examples to help illustrate our own shortcomings in our predictions of future happiness. The author sheds light on the flaws in our own expectations and helps explain why we repeatedly fall victim to the traps of envisioning our future happiness. It was an easy read, which left me feeling quite enlightened when I was finished."
1,Broken record...,"Interesting topic with an endless list of mildly interesting experiments. I said to myself throughout the book ""Ok, yeah, I get it, let's move on."" But the author never does...he beats a dead horse trying to make his point. Over and over, it's one example after another after another after another after another after another...without end (you get it?). I tapped into both my visual and emotional cortices to visualize giving the author a beating and to imagine how wonderful that would feel - certainly, I probably underestimated the magnitude of this pleasure. This book could have easily been a better read and more digestible in about 100 pages."
5,Stumbling on Genius,"It's not just happiness that we don't ""see""...it's our entire lives. We miss what is really there because we are looking through biases, beliefs and values that literally change our perceptions.Gilbert writes a wonderful treatise on the flawed perceptions, thinking and conclusions made by the human brain.He offers a few suggestions for greater understanding of the self and moving more effectively into the future...with eyes wide open...but as he notes...the recommendations are things that are very simple and very simple to ignore.If you want to see how human thinking, memory, and our experience is indeed only our experience...then this is the book.Certainly the finest nonfiction read of the year to date.Kevin HoganAuthor of The Psychology of PersuasionandThe Science of Influence"
2,Overated,"For a Harvard academic, Gilbert completely ignores some important issues.1. He has absolutely nothing to say about variance in the studies he cites.2. He extrapolates huge existential conclusions from the data on studies that are extremely, extremely limited in scope.3. Most of the studies he cites were done on college students.4. He can be funny and clever, but the book is so puffed up with his self-flattering comedic act that it becomes a distraction.5. He completely misunderstands the John Lennon song, ""Imagine."""
1,it was hard to get into the book,i felt liked he jumped around a lot and it was just hard to follow. he used to many volunteer scenarios
2,huh?,I found this book very hard to understand?? This book was over my head and not what I had expected. Much more technical that I would have liked
1,A VERY tough read,"I wanted to like the book and the first chapter was really well written - pleasant, funny and thought provoking. As the book goes on it makes the same point again and again, more and more dryly. I pressed on through page 100 then just gave up. Sorry, Mr. Gilbert, I really wanted some ahas but found none past the first chapter."
4,Find youself,"Good self-help book for those who have lost themselves, or feel they have lost touch with what makes them happy."
2,Could be condensed to 10 pages,"All the points the author tries to make could be condensed to a 10- or 15-page leaflet and would be a great leaflet CLEAR enough. But to make it a book of a few hundred pages, imagine how much useless irrelevant stuff you have to read! Well, perhaps to make money, you got to make it into a book.I have attended the author's seminars... they are good. But this book? too much rambling to fill the pages."
5,Great book!,"It's rare that I have time to read non-text books and I'm glad I prioritized this one. It ""dumbs"" down years of science and makes it easy for laypeople to understand but gives a lot of insight into human behavior. Very entertaining and well-written-- a great ""plane"" book. I highly recommend Stumbling on Happiness."
3,Is the author too happy with himself?,"This book was a bit of a disappointment. The writing style starts out as refreshing, but soon becomes monotonous. The author is trying too hard to be cute. The essential material is interesting, but it becomes hard to make headway against the onslaught of writing whitewater. I wish the author had disappeared as the material unfurled, and allowed me to engage with it, instead of having to engage with his attempts at wit at every turn. The author gets in his own way here too often, and doesn't find the happy medium between self and material."
2,Doesn't Say Much,It sounded good with a catchy title and decent reviews. But I just couldn't get into it and ended up not continuing it after reading several chapters. I imagine most folks could find much better use of their time than forcing themselves to pore through this one.
3,Great Thoughts ! Slow Read,"This is a great book. Full of interesting information. However, I don'tthink it is for the average person because it is written almost like acollege text. Even tho I am a college professor, I found myself puttingin away for a few days and then going back to it."
2,I stopped reading it....,"...when it started to depress me. A great magazine article stretched into a book. Be more concise, Mr. Gilbert."
3,jokes are over the top,Gave it a 3 as it seems to have good ideas. Can't get through it though. Every damn sentence has a joke or parenthetical cute remark. Blech.
4,Better than happiness,"This book title is wrong as it deals with more than ""how to get happiness"".It deals with the working of minds - what we didnt know we didnt know.you will especially enjoy all the experiments described in the book.The books humour and debate could have been appealed to international audience if the references (location, stores, dates etc)pertaining to US-only audience is removed."
2,No conclusions to be found in this book,"Although peppered with a few interesting points, the author never draws a conclusion or tells us anything truly useful. He seems more interesting in demonstrating his wit to the reader than writing a useful book.I bought the book after glancing through a few random pages. Any given part of the book makes for an interesting read, but the book in its entirety leaves an empty feeling."
3,Stumbling into Psychology,I have to admit I only made to page 200 and something. It starts out good. Dr Gilbert is very witty and I had to chuckle at almost every page. This book shows using the results of psychological experiments that our memory of the past and our predictions for the future are flawed by rationalization and other tricks our mind plays on us. Gilbert applies this to happiness but that is about as deep as it gets. He seems to disregard the notions of virtue and happiness by limiting his discussion to what he terms emotional happiness and then shows that we can not predict what will make us emotionally happy. The whole book is just experiment after experiment based on rewards such as snack food and from this he extrapolates ideas about our ultimate happiness. It became very monotonous and I could not finish it.
2,I couldn't finish this book,"There is nothing succinct about this book. I really wanted to know what the author had to say on the subject (I have read three other books on happiness lately and have ordered a fourth) but I simply couldn't wade through all the tangents to get to his point. I usually enjoy a quick side note by an author to illustrate an argument or theory, but this author's side notes went on for pages. By the end of the chapter I was no longer sure what the author was trying to say. What I was able to read was pretty interesting, which is why I gave it two stars instead of one, but after several chapters of wanting to scream, ""Get to the point!"" I simply put it down."
2,Get to the point already,"I get what the book is about. However, I found that if I were back at college and he were a professor, that he would be one whom I'd classify as ""Likes to hear himself talk"". I found that he digressed from his points way to many times in the book, or would list off examples that took up almost an entire paragraph, vice one or two followed by a succint ""etc."". This caused me frustration, and often i would scan through this to get ahead just to see what the point was he was driving at. Overall, the book is just okay. Not very in depth, and doesn't really resolve anything."
1,Ir's basically a list of experiments,"I bought this book because I wanted to know how I could become happy. However, this book turned out to be a long list of psychological experiments that proved how badly human imagination and memories are flawed and follible. Yet the author concludes that nothing is better than our imagination and memories to depend on to predict our future happiness."
1,More fluff than substance,"The author presented basic findings about human perception and judgment rather than actual findings about the concept of happiness. If you've ever taken an Intro to Psychology course in college, you probably already know about 90% of what the book contains. He describes numerous studies in full detail (much more than needed) and doesn't seem to tie them together well. He meanders around his point in this haphazard way.He inserts tons of little jokes and witty comments that are clearly designed to just entertain us. It was clearly an approach that came off as trying-too-hard, and it just suggests to the reader that they would consider his points about the subject too boring to be interesting on their own.All in all, you end the book with more questions than you have answers, and you think of all the better ways out there that would have actually taught you something about the subject."
1,Not at all uplifting,"I bought this book hoping to be enlightened about the workings of the human mind in terms of the pursuit of happiness. What I got was pages and pages of inane studies such as how to determine the satisfaction one expects to get from a potato chip in a variety of controlled situations. We are admonished to forget about imagination because we're incapable of knowing what will make us happy anyway. What a bunch of drivel! What's the point of possessing a conscious mind if you're not going to use it to dream, imagine, and invent your life! In addition, Mr. Gilbert has a good sense of humor but he uses it way too much. Forget this piece of garbage and re-read Norman Vincent Peale's ""The Power of Positive Thinking."""
1,This book is not worth buying,There's not much substance in this book. The lard factor of this book is at about 90%. He talks about nothing most of the time. I'd often finish a whole chapter and find one or two sentences that are meaningful.
1,Mixed review,"Amazon showed the vendor as having my book but turns out they did not have it. They also sent me the wrong book in the mail by mistake. I did get my money back but would have preferred the actual book i ordered, Stumbling on Happiness."
3,Where is God in all this?,"Happiness is unattainable because Man is incomplete. And it will continue to be impossible to achieve until we learn to fill the vacuum within ourselves with the loving spiritual presence of a Supreme Being. Neither Gilbert nor the millions who have dealt with the same issues before him were able to provide answers. If your goal is to understand what real happiness means, try to connect with a loving God whatever His name may be and forget the book.Andrew J. RodriguezAward-winning author: ""Adios, Havana,"" a Memoir"
4,"Not a How-To, but a Why","Dr. Gilbert does an excellent job of explaining, in layman's terms, how the emotion of happiness works in the human mind. This book is more inspirational than instructional: it helps you understand how your emotions work, rather than how to manipulate them. So if you're looking for something to teach you how to be happy, this book isn't for you. But if you're interested in logically dissecting your emotions, particularly in relation to how you think you should feel, this book can be invaluable.I would like to thank Pete Wilson on KGO radio for interviewing Dr. Gilbert. This interview inspired me to buy the book."
