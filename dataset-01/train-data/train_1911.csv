3,Damaged before sent.,"I have already reported to the packaging people - who asked for a standard report on the packaging. In a complete and totally undamaged outer package, the spine of the book was damaged when the box was opened. As detailed in that report I am unhappy with this result as the book was to be a present and now cannot be given. No one has acknowledged or responded to my 'packaging' reply. I ask myself,'Do they really want to know?'....I cannot really tell. Silence simply shows disinterest.Barry Roennfeldt"
2,"Spotmeter, yes. Zone System, no.","The information in this book would be a good 5 page appendix to some camera manuals. I used to cover it in about 30 minutes of class when I taught.While this book is obviously useful for many people who are totally new to photography, it is not a view of the simplified zone system as it says. People who learned that they have a spotmeter from this book will need to read a lot more for any understanding of the real zone system.The zone system can only be practiced with a combination of exposure and development. It is not child's play.The basic message is correct. You haven't a prayer of knowing what your black and white picture will look like unless you are already an expert or turn off the automatic exposure gizmos and get to know your subjects through a spot meter.Color is another matter, of course, and the vast majority of people make color pictures."
2,The book is an overkill.,I didn't know much about the spotmetering and graycards before I bought this book and I don't regret buying and reading this book but... After reading the book I could rewrite the basics in just one sentence or with detailed examples and sample photos on just 10 pages. It seems like the author either underestimated our intelligence or tried to get a bigger number of pages for the (more costly) book.
5,Really good shoes!,"These shoes are great! I own a pair already and I've had them for nearly two years and have worn them in a medical/dental environment. The flooring at my workplace is mostly that nubby, low-pile carpeting that has torn up or worn down other shoe soles in no time at all -- most of my other shoes haven't made it past 6 months! The toes have had the black polish worn away, but some shoe polish and a quick shine with a soft cloth takes care of it.The only drawback is that I have a narrow heel, which makes it easy for me to twist my ankle. My remedy was to wear thicker socks, and that fixed it right up! I still love these shoes, even though I've pretty much worn them out now, that's why I'm ordering them again. I'll probably order two pair so should Ariat decide to do away with this shoe, at least I'll be set for another 4-5 years."
1,not solid sterling silver,"Although this product is pretty to look at, one must remember not to bend it to fit as it will crack the silver plating and the bracelet will fall apart in your hands. I do not suggest buying this item as it is not solid sterling silver as you are lead to believe."
2,"Good Customer Service, Poor product...","I'm giving 2 stars instead of 1 because their customer service (communication and such) have been very good.I purchased this bracelet a few months ago and (a few days ago) had the unfortunate experience as the previous reviewer. I was taking it off and it snapped in the middle. Once you could see the insides, it was obviously not pure Sterling Silver as the ""materials"" portion indicates. I will be returning this item for a new one (already gave my girl a matching one) and may not even wear it at all...*very disappointing*"
2,Go to Harbor Freight,"I bought the same equipment yesterday at Harbor Freight for $7.99. Different brand, same stuff."
1,Not Good,"Tried this on a small and big dent and it did not reduce either dents. After I applied the glue and twisted the tab, the entire tool would pop off and the glue remained on the car. You're probably better off buying the industrial pump puller."
1,Don't Waste Your Money or Time DOES NOT WORK,Unfortunately I used this product after the 30 days return time and I was VERY DISAPPOINTED that it did not work at all. The glue dries very quickly and does not have enough pull power for the smallest ding. A real waste of money and time!
1,My feet can't dance to this!,"Like so many Madacy releases, this is synthesized and predictably dull. The paired tracks are especially strange to try to dance to. The same tracks are available under at least one other album title and in a boxed set - Caveat emptor! Imagine how tragic it is to pay, as I did, for this stuff more than once. At the time of this review, you can hear the first 20 or so seconds of each track. They don't impove towards the end. Once again, buyer beware!Here is the title, duration, and suggested dance:Turtle, The, 4:24, WaltzNothing Gonna Stop Us / My Lady My Love, 3:55, TangoWaltz Street, The, 2:43, Viennese WaltzThrough The Barricades / Match, The, 4:47, FoxtrotLass die Sonne / Du bist nicht Allein, 3:45, QuickstepCrockett's Theme / Mayfly, The, 3:21, Cha chaStand By Me / Your Smile, 4:29, RumbaWalk Like An Egyptian / Talk Like An Arab, 3:40, JiveIsla Bonita, La / Buffoon, The, 4:05, SambaTorro Rojo, El, 2:55, Pasodoble"
2,The wrist support keeps getting in the way!,"I bought this mouse pad to ease the strain on my wrist since I use the PC a great portion of the day. The wrist support feels good and the mouse pad works fine. However, the wrist support keeps getting in the way of the mouse ... my mouse is always bumping into it so I end up having to turn the mouse pad around to avoid collision but in doing that, I no longer have access to support my wrist. OY VEY!! I got so annoyed with the constant collision between the wrist support and my mouse that I just went back to using the old flat mouse pad. Oh well, I tried. Would I buy it again? No...the aggravation is just not worth it."
3,"Pad is smaller than listed, and a different shape.","This mouse pad is OK, but it is actually only 10 X 8 inches instead of the 12.8 x 9 inches listed in the description, which must be the size of the package it comes in. The actual pad is also a different shape than the one pictured. I had Amazon send me a replacement, but it was still only 8 X 10 inches."
1,Would give zero stars if that were an option!,"I bought this book after reading the good comments of other reviewers, but find I completely wasted my money since I immediately donated it to charity without ever letting my kids see it. I am pretty liberal about what they read----""My Monster Mama loves me so"" and ""Frank was a Monster (who wanted to dance)"" are their FAVORITE books---but this book is plain scary, not humorous or comforting. I bought this for my fearful 5-year-old (to try to help quell her fear of the dark) but this book would give even my eight-year-old nightmares, though my 10-year-old would probably find it amusing. I agree with the reviewer who said that mom is made to look like a bit of a dolt, right up until the very last (and somewhat confusing) page. If your kids weren't scared of the dark before reading this, it will give them plenty of new monsters to worry about. Skip this book and instead go for ""No Such Thing""."
5,Great Kid's Book,"Sure, some of the illustrations scared me as a kid, but I loved it all the same. I used to beg my mom to read it to me all the time. Sadly, I got rid of it a while ago, and pretty soon I missed it dearly. I bought a new copy of it just today and couldn't be happier. I'm so glad to have found it still in print. This book is indespensible, no matter what..."
2,Children's Fears,"I purchased this book specifically because my daughter has sensory issues with exaggerated fears of the dark and monsters. It was a bit helpful in trying to assuage her fears but it really didn't calm her down and had to read the story to her a few times. I was a bit disappointed but my daughter brings up the story when she has her bad days dealing with this type of fear. The drawings in the book didn't really help her and at times had the opposite affect and frightened her.She did respond to the premise that there were other children with the same sort of fears she has of going to sleep and the dark. For my daughter, she thinks she is the only one to have these kinds of issues. I did appreciate that the book was able to make her realize she is not alone with her fears."
4,Fun book to read to your kids.,"I love to read. I read mostly Horror, this can make for dificult questions from my son. This was a fun book to give my son on his birthday and keep his dreams full of fun!"
1,"gameplay is uneven, too difficult","I know there are limits to the Gameboy Advance's memory, but why don't programmers work within those confines to make a solid game???..instead of trying to cram tons of characters and moves into one game that turns out [poor]? In Mortal Kombat Advance, the characters are hard to see...and the sound effects are messed up. Sometimes when you score a hit, there is just silence, or some kind of wimpering noise. Also, even on the easiest level, it is very, very difficult to win. I say don't buy this game unless your an expert at Mortal Kombat and don't mind straining your eyesight to follow the action."
4,mortal kombat is back... advanced,"the world of mortal kombat is back. with all your favorite characters such as goro and sub-zero,it is a great fighting game. play much like mortal kombat trilogy with a few new characters!*"
1,Worst game ever!!!...,This must be the worst game i have ever played in my entire life the game is full of ... glicthes. The special moves go right past your opponents and don't any damgae. some times the characters don't even respond at all. stay away from this game at all costs! ...
1,Rushed For The Holidays...,"This game feels so RUSHED! Compared to Super Street Fighter II Turbo Revival this game is just plain pathetic. The animation is choppy, there are limited sound effects, and the controls are horrid. Not to mention that you have to set the difficulty to easiest just to beat Scorpion (the first opponent) and even then you'll be lucky to beat him! The AI is just too hard!!! I really wish they would have taken the time to make a decent port instead of this disappointment which was obviously rushed in time for the holiday shopping season... =("
1,it is nadal!!!,this game is nadal!!! this game is nadal!!!this game is nadal!!!this game is nadal!!!this game is nadal!!thisthis game is nadal!!! game is nadal!!!!this game is nadalthis game is nadal!!!!!!this game is nadal!!! mr. x!!! give me some cheeps!!! mista wuuuuuuuuu!!! you come here!!! remain in your regular seats!!! varela bomb!!!
1,Buy this as a Christmas Present for your enemy,"If you truly and utterly hate someone, then I have a little hint for you. Buy them this game. When they play and see the sketchy graphics, the poor backgrounds, and the fact that some of the special moves go through your opponent, they will think the game is defective. When they go to the game store to exchange it for a real copy, you will laugh with glee as they find that there was no defect, but it was the real game! Only use this against a bitter enemy however, as this game is an incredible torture that I would wish upon noone. If that doesn't convince you to run away at the sight of this game, then let me put it this way: Hitler is being forced to play it right now on the 9th level of Hell."
3,15 year old gamer,"This version is modeled just like the arcade version, which was fun for a few minutes and for a quarter or two while you waited for your pizza. But, it is difficult and gets boring quickly because all you can do is fight and switch from character to character. If you are very good at this type of game and can find out the specials and finishing moves, at least wait for the price to drop.For an arcade game, this was great fun and good at sucking up spare quarters. But for a permanantly owned game that you hope to get a lot of hours out of, it is repetitive and disappoints."
2,What......,"If only Midway would put more thought into their games, this could have been one of the best games for the GBA. First off this is an exact copy of the 16 bit versions of Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, which isn't a bad thing, but the translation to the GBA could have been done much, MUCH more better, and what we have is a game that feels unfinished. The graphics are bland, very bland. The characters are stiff and the animation is very jerky. The moves aren't as easy to pull off as you might think, and yeah they take practice to pull off, but they could have been made much better. All in all, Mortal Kombat Advance isn't worth the asking price, but its not a completely bad game, just buy it when you find it in a bargain bin."
2,BOORRRIIIINNNNGGGG!!!!!,"This game bums! I mean, it's a hell of a lot better than the MK 4 Game Boy color, but it's still so darn horrible! The graphics are barely above bad, there is not nearly as much fun in the gameplay or moves as there is in MK Trilogy(which I plan to get for my big computer), and the sound and character design is atrocious. I think that this game belongs on the shelves except if you either have no love for yourself or if you want to pay a jerk back for something rotten he did to you. What was Ed Boon thinking(no offense to him) when he made this waste of mechanics? Man, oh man, don't waste your cash on this game. Buy MK4 or II or a really worthy MK game."
2,Why did they even bother,"When Mortal Combat hit the arcade, it was a fighting game worthy to be played. It was followed up by Mortal Combat 2 which was also a worthy fighting game. After MK2, the game became a joke. Today, MK is a joke because they haven't even incorporated a good combo system like any capcom fighter or SNK fighter. Acclaim needs to give this title a frikin rest. They are just as bad as George Lucas releasing Episodes 4,5, and 6 again.Bottom line is, if you played a single MK game in your life, then you arent missing out by not playing MKA. Go get a real fighting game rather than this lame piece of work."
3,"Quality Mortal Kombat title, but not great","I must admit, when I saw some of the first reviews for Mortal Kombat Advance, it didn't look so good. I'm a Mortal Kombat fan, so I decided to give it a try. It has great graphics, decent gameplay, and quality sound. This game has potential to be better, but it is still a solid title."
2,MKA = UMK3,"Its umk3 potable and ruined. It could have been so easy to finally come out with a good mk game on gameboy. the graphics and sound are incredible, and the number of players is nice, but pnce again the game play is sooo bad. It is extermely hard, and very boring. The people move so slow and its almost impossible to win. They should take the old mk2 for the old gb and port it to gba with color and bloo(sorta like the gg version) that would be a thousand times better."
1,Need a prop for your wobbly table?,"If you want horrable controls, 8-bit nes sound, as much animation as a atari 2600, a way to torment someone by locking them in a room with this game and only this game, or even a prop for that pesky table that wont stop wobbling this is the game for you!!! Mortal Kombat Advance is one of the worst games I have ever played. In fact im still debating as to which game is better E.T. for atari 2600 or this chunk of plastic they call a game. Save your money for something good and just use something less expensive for that pesky table. :)"
1,EGM's lowest rated game ever.,"If I remember correctly, in an old issue of Electronic Gaming Monthly (probably the most respected magazine for console gaming), Dan Hsu gave this game a rating of a 0/10; making this to my knowledge, the lowest rated game ever ever reviewed by them. He spoke of numerous glitches in combat itself and combos not being added up correctly... just a blatantly terrible game."
3,Finish Him!,"This game is too easy, there really isn't that much of a challenge, and unlocking Shao Kahn, Motaro, and Human Smoke isn't really as exciting as it seems. If you unlock them, you can only use them once. Someone needs to find a good code for this game, like Hyper Mode."
5,Homing,"This is the last book in a series of books called the Williamsburg novels. I have been reading and re-reading this series of 7 books for over 50 years. They are my all time favorite books. Each book deals with a war or pre-war action (except the war of 1812) in which the US has taken part from the Revolutionary War (Dawn's Early Light) to the Civil War (Yankee Stranger) to the Homing with is the last of the series and the 4th book which deals with WWI and WWII and the years in between. They are a great source of history. Ms Thane (widow of the explorer Dr. William Beebe) has done an excellent job of research for each of the books. I hope others find them as wonderful, and as entertaining as I do. I have read my old copies until they are falling apart. I was very excited to find they had been reprinted and purchased them immediately."
2,"Looks good, Dosent work!","This looks cool in my bearded dragons tank...but it does not self dispense water what so ever..you have to unscrew the bottle and let the water come out every time you want fresh water in the tiny opening...good idea but wasnt made correctly, i would pass on this one unless you dont mind messing with the water everyday."
4,Very simple,This product is very convenient for our leopard gecko. Simple. We are very pleased.It is the right size for the tank and easy to use.
1,One of my leopard geckos could have died!,"I replaced my old water dish with this Exo Terra Water Well and was away for 3 days. I came home to find one of the 3 leopard geckos severely dehydrated. I thought she was not going to make it. I put her in a moist hide and she kept drinking and drinking from the wet paper towel in the hide. She obviously wasn't able to find the water even though this Water Well was put in the usual corner where the old water dish was. Like the other reviews mentioned, there's VERY little water in the visible part of the dish. Without the top cover, it's more usable because there's more drinkable surface."
2,"Looks nice, but...","I purchased this item because I thought it would look nicer than a typical plastic water dish in my beardies home. It looks nice, but the water level is extremely shallow. I know my dragon doesn't need anything more than just a puddle to lick up, but this isn't even 1/4 inch deep. This item has to be placed on a perfectly level surface or all the water can rest in the back of it making it inaccessible to FartZilla. I suppose if you used a sand substrate you could compensate for this and angle it a little more. I use a slate tile substrate and needed to shim it up a little bit. I didn't have to do that with an open water dish. Speaking of that, the opening of this item is just barely an inch wide. Mine is still only nine inches long and I want to see him try to use it when he has a bigger head. I wouldn't recommend this item for anything larger than a leopard gecko or maybe a bearded dragon."
5,Just good. Get this album.,"Otis Redding is purely good soul music. It's hard for me to write a review of this album, because Redding is just a good musician and singer. This album has been one of the favorites in my collection, and it's played frequently.If you're a fan of soul, or rock n roll, or pretty much anything else. You'll like this album. Especially if you keep an open mind and an open heart ;) he has a lot to give."
5,excellent transaction... very pleased,The product arrived in a more than timely fashion and was as described.. very good seller... will use again
5,as good as it gets,"I lost my old tapes of Otis Redding so I was thrilled when I found this CD. I have another CD that is similar and I just can't find anything bad to say about either one. I was lucky to see him up close at Basin Street West in the 60's (San Francisco) not long before the tragic plane accident. It was the best performance I have ever seen BAR NONE ! This Cd is not as good as that experience but if I close my eyes and no one else is around it brings me back to that night, almost ."
1,Erroneous and Incomplete,"This biography of ME was written without my knowledge, let alone input of any kind. There are errors about my personal life, and only half of my published output is even mentioned in this entry. If all the ""author biographies"" published by this company (whom I contacted, but did not reply) are this inaccurate, I would suggest NOT supporting them. A biography of me is a little ridiculous, anyway. I've written a lot of books over the past 20 years (most of which are available here on Amazon), but you should read about the wonderful people I write about, NOT the author. Don't waste your money on this. If you want to know something of substance that is ACCURATE, send me an email instead."
4,you forgot to mention how *hilarious* this movie is!,"Restoration, I think, is an extremely funny film! Robert Downey Jr. is perfect-he has the ability to be subtle yet completely ridiculous at the same time. The cast was perfectly picked (ex: Meg Ryan's small but wonderful role). I was laughing out loud! Watch this movie if you like period films but want to see one that's a little different than the rest."
4,Excellent Fairy Tale,"A story that is surprisingly light-hearted, funny and optimistic even amongst the horrors of the plague and the great fire of London. Unique both visually and in tone from other period films. The story moves along at a very fast pace, leaving some characters underdeveloped, but overall this charming fairytale is one celebrating progress and human kindness. Excellent performances by Downey Junior and Sam Neill."
5,Robert Downey jr.'s Best Performance,"I LOVED this film. I wasn't sure at first if it would be as wonderful as I had heard, but it was! Meg Ryan gives an exquisite and moving performance, one that before seeing this film, I didn't think she was capable of accomplishing. Visually this film is magnificent and sumptutous. If you love Robert Downey, Jr., as an actor, you will love this film!"
3,RESTORATION A Review of The DVD,The film is excellent but the DVD lacked subtitles for the hearing impaired. The background sound is loud while the dialog is not audible.
4,a story in 17th-century,"This movie is very beautiful, inspired by Rose Tremain book. Despite its flaws, Restoration proves that Robert Downey Jr. is a wonderful performing actor and the historic places of the shooting are magnificent."
3,Good movie but needs subtitles for US viewers,"I really enjoyed the movie but I had a very hard time understanding the dialog. Being a British film, the actors, of course, use British accents.But since I speak US English it is very hard for me to understand some of the actors. It doesn't help that I am somewhat hard of hearing.Since the large majority of movies these days have subtitles it is hard to understand why a DVD which is marketed for the US doesn't have them.Edward Smith"
3,Contrived,"I was never really drawn into this movie and found it somewhat tedious to watch until the second half. It felt like the scenes were contrived and the movie was somewhat disconnected. I like the actors in this movie but didn't get the sense that they were drawn into it either, with the exception of David Thewlis who did an excellent job with his character. I think the movie was messy, both in concept and direction."
2,read it...!,"My enjoyment of this movie was somwhat dimmed my the fact that I read the book first. With the greatest will in the world, Robert Downey Jr. although a superb actor in no way resembles the character of Merivel in the book.Although the movie itself is entertaining, I really must recommend reading the book. (It's by Rose Tremain)"
1,Not what I expected,"I got this at a low price, so not much lost. I was expecting the widescreen version. It was chopped, and had no extras whatsoever. I ended up giving it away, and will purchase the better version later on. I love this film, but would not recommend this version of it."
5,Restoration is not just a period of British history.,"Sometimes restoration is about the rehabilitation of the human spirit, and this movie is a perfect depiction of that. This is a beautiful film in all respects. The costumes and settings are second to none. All the actors deliver completely believable performances. Best of all, we get another example of how the human spirit can be redeemed and uplifted. One viewing of this movie could never be enough. It will become a mainstay in many private collections, as it has in mine."
5,Whats not to love?,Robert was in prime form in this movie and was incredible in his ability to convince us that he was a 17th century doctor/playboy. I loved every minute of this movie and bought it so i could watch it again and again.
3,Why on earth Meg Ryan?,"The action is supposed to take place in England. Why are there so many American actors? Are there no more British actors left, who don't have to fake a sophisticated accent? I didn't mind Sam Neil. But why on earth Meg Ryan? Now granted, she is not awful, and she doesn't ruin the movie, but there are so many great blonde 30-something British and Irish actresses that I can think of right off the top of my head. Why did pick a romantic comedy icon? I guess, the movie was intended for American audiences. It had too many tear-jerking moments, not enough history and politics. It's a costume romance drama, not a true historical piece."
5,Easy listening.,I have lots of. Emile Pandolfis music. Really is easy listening. II listen to his music on. A. daily bases
2,Good if you wanted to read incomprehensible post-situs,"If you were expecting to understand what the situationists were about, expect to still not understand. This book is almost worthless if not understanding how horrible post-situationists are. Very few of these are written for an understanding of what ""situationism"", if such a word exists, is. Instead, it offers several loosely related essays written by people who were influenced by Situationists. This would be the last book I would suggest for anyone to read to understand the Situationists.I would definitely suggest Guy Debord and the Situationists International or the Situationist Anthology. Hell, I would even suggest fight club if you wanted a better understanding of what ""situationism"" is, because it'll probably do a better job than this."
4,Cool flick,"This movie is well acted. Great plot. Really cool flick. Michael T Weiss is great in this role. Really has an edge.Peter Coyotoe is always great and special nod for Gwen McGee (Coach Carter, Clearing)who stood out as Weiss boss, Captian Streeter,"
5,WAY BEFORE HER TIME....,"I can remember the first time I heard Timi sing ""Hurt"".I was hypnotized by her voice. It was amazing to hearthis big voice come from this tiny girl.If she had come on the scene today I think she wouldhave received the acclaim she deserves.This talented artist was way before her time.Unfortunately Timi also died before her time."
3,NOT BAD FOR 10 BUCKS,This game is suprisingly decent and is worth the money let me start with the negatives the graphics are horrible the controls on the battle field are bad and it not very stratigic basicly kill them before they kill you pretty simple. this game shines when you talk about story and plot development its very intresting and will keep you hooked for a couple weeks oh yeah i forgot about the load time t suck very bad it loads on everything the load time sucks on the ps2 set on load fast.to make a long story short if yoou like tactical games or love a great story this game is for you.
4,Early offerings,"This album by virtue of it's title say's it all.The groth years and his contributions to ""The age of Jazz"",are nurtured by all of the talent of his day and it is these individuals who made a lasting inpression on Condon who later utilized not only his own talents in ""American Jazz"" but all of the best talent of the day to be gathered by this musician and recorded some of the best Jazz available for future generations to study and enjoy. Eddie Condon has in his lifetime helped create an encylopedia of material on a unique music which is totally American and is one of the better things we have left for all the world to enjoy."
3,Eddie,"If you like the old music as I do, you'll enjo the sides. Its nice to actually hear eddie Condon's guitar. He played with a lot of great people - many are heard on these CDs."
4,Swing Dance and Sing,My children LOVE this DVD. I really enjoy this music also; and the skits are very clever and entertaining. The world needs more Mamas music.
5,Great Source for Natural Treatments!,"I have purchased about eight copies of this book because someone is always asking if they can borrow mine. I am down to only one of my own now :).This is one of the last books written that still has some realistic natural advice. So many books now are sterilized reading because the authors don't want to get in trouble with the powers-that-be - the advice in many newer books is somewhat feeble.I have used this book for countless remedies in my family. Often, this book had the answer when other, more traditional, sources did not. I believe in using this book as a complement to regular medical care. Always seek medical advice when you are dealing with a potentially serious issue, but a book like this is very helpful to have in your home, especially for common complaints (like eczema, acne, yeast infections, annoying coughs, and hundreds more."
1,Not happy with this purchase at all!,This book was listed as NEW but I received a USED book. I DO NOT recommend this seller.
4,A dominating team,"The 1996 version of the Kentucky Wildcats was an excellent one, and it was the team that most deserving to win the National Championship that year. The Final Four participants that year were Kentucky, UMASS, Syracuse, and Mississippi State. The title game featured The Syracuse Orangemen and the Wildcats of Kentucky. While the game was respectable, Kentucky basically dominated the game, and triumphed for its first National Crown in a while. They would also win in 1998 and in 1997, they were the runner-up to the Wildcats of Arizona."
5,"Forget You, It's Great","Collins' Grammy-winning Album of the Year has aged well... the new Audio Fidelity disc sounds great... Daryl Stuermer's guitar really shines, as do the drums on my favorite NJR track, ""Doesn't Anybody Stay Together Anymore."""
2,Phil,"Same here, didnt have the songs on it I remembered. If the site had the play songs.. read whats on it option I could've avoided the dissapointment"
5,one of the 3 great masters of the 80s,"phil collins was one of the 3 great masters of the 80s, along with grandma and jean-michel jarre. houston was the center point of 80s mania with jean-michel jarre's rendezvouz houston and grandma's house playing phil collins while everybody was always there. in the 80s the night ruled, with the michelob commercial that played ""i move better in the night"" and phil collins ""in the air tonight"" playing as the music for the commmercial. i wish it was still back then because i could ejaculate to 80s mayhem. if you dont know what i'm talkin about then you dont know the 80s."
2,Disappointing...,"There is abundant evidence--not just theory, but actual physical evidence--that Phil Collins happens to be a really good drummer. So what kind of self-hatred would make him replace himself with a too-high-in-the-mix Linn Drum machine for not one, or even two, but *every single song* on his solo album? As a direct result of this bizarre act, there really aren't any ""songs"" present--only loud, dull rhythms. ""Take Me Home"" is virtually the only place in which melody arises-and even it barely escapes from the jaws of the almighty top-40 beat."
2,one song scratched on cd,"One of the most popular songs in cd, I could not listen to because the cd was scratched."
2,"Some good songs, but the album isn't that good","There are only three good songs on this album. If you like Phil Collins alot, then pick up this album. Otherwise just pick up his greatest hits cd because his hits cd has all of his good material on it. The other 8 songs on this album really don't gel that well when compared with the other 3 good songs."
2,Very Average,I used to dig this Album More Back when it was out.But He Bites Too Much Here.Sussudio is a Rip Off Of Prince's 1999.Take Me Home is So-So.I Respect His Ability at Drum Beats&Production.One More Night is the Best cut here.but this Album Hasn't Aged well at all.
5,Great Classic Music I Truly Enjoy,"There is no doubt in my mind this is Phill Collins best soloeffot adside from rock group Genesis. Every song on this releaseis amazing and it shows Collins Uncanny abilty to sing songsthat leave a lasting impression. Great upbeat songs like ""Sussudio"" ""Don't Lose My Number"" and even the slower, more relaxed Melodily ""Long,Long Way To Go"" and the romantic ballad ""One More Night"" are really his best accomplishments.And the man can still make good music today, which is difficulttoday with all the different styles of music going around butsomehow don't have the staying power That Phill Collins and other Musicians from his time have."
4,A very good pop/dance album.,"This is the big smash album for Phil Collins. Just a couple of years after the big self-titled pop album for his band Genesis, this came out. The songs on here are for the most part good.(Particulary Take Me Home, and Don't Lose My Number, both big singles for him.) Despite it being his most loved album it also offers some of his most underated songs(Only You and I Know, Long Long Way to Go, Inside Out, We Said Hello Goodbye) as well as possibly his worst(Doesn't Anybody Stay Together Anymore?) The production is pretty bad on here, especially on Sussido, Don't Lose My Number and Take Me Home. However the live versions of these songs more than make up for that. If you can tolerate pop music, buy it and enjoy yourself."
4,"Phil Collin's best album, but needs to be REMASTERED!","An excellent disc, but one that is in dire need of a proper remaster to do it justice. The sound quality on this CD (which has been out for more than 20 years) sounds thin, because the technology was not available at the time to create the full, rich sound that is now standard.If anyone is reading this who knows someone who knows someone who can get someone to get the job done, please, pass this message along: a REMASTERED version of this disc is URGENTLY NEEDED!!!"
1,No Taste Required,"No taste required to enjoy this album. Phil Collins should stick to Genesis and the drums. As an adult, I have to say that adult contemporary music has to go. A friend of mine played this album for me trying to convert me to the Collins camp. What was he thinking?"
3,It's Edited,"I've watched (and enjoyed) all of James May's Man Lab episodes on youtube, so when I received the DVD of the first season of Man Lab I was excited, expecting behind the scenes stuff, bloopers, etc. But no. Not only do you not get any 'extra' stuff, the episodes are actually edited (shortened) from the UK version. While I still enjoy the show's contents, it really detracts knowing there was stuff taken out that actually added to the episode. Plus, all episodes have the end music theme cut out (it's a part where James May's original version of the theme, which he composed, is re-done by a group or individual with different instruments--a fun part of the show). So, while the show itself is good, the DVD version is disappointing because of the edits. Don't know if Mr. May had anything to do with it, but hopefully it will be corrected in season II version."
1,TERRIBLE!!!!!!,this game is terrible. i only got it because i usually like star wars games. there are very limited force powers and you dont even get ANY other weapons which would be nice since the lightsaber doesnt work too well. the levels are small and boring. i payed more than 20 dollars for this game but it is not even worth twenty.buy any star wars game other than this!
1,"VERY RUSHED, AND POOR EXECUTION","...THE MULTIPLAYER ARENS ARE SMALLER THAN A BATHRROOM. THE GRAPHICS ARE HORRIBLE, (I THINK DOOM IS MUCH BETTER) AND THE PHYSICS ENGINE IS JUST UNBELIEEABLE. THE GAME CRASHES ...OFTEN ...ANYONE, PLEASE RETURN IT AND DONT BUY IT. IF U SEE SOMEONE GETTING IT, SAY THE FOLLOWING, ""PLEASE, SIR, STEP AWAY FROM OBI-WAN BEFORE I CALL THE POLICE. THANK YOU, AND DON'T BUY THIS HORRIBLE GAME."
2,Don't bother the force is weak with this one...,This is not the game that it was originaly hyped to be. It has a slow frame rate and very poor graphics. Simply a hack and slash game (can you say phantom menace? If you've played that you've already played Obi-wan). It would be best to pass on this one and get Jedi Knight 2 (the sequal to Dark Forces) when it comes out in the spring.
3,Better then expected!,"I purchased Obi-wan, used for under $15, to see what the game was like eventhough it gets horrible reviews at most places and is rated one of the worst xbox games out there.I was pleasantly surprised though as the game was much better then I had expected. If you are a Star Wars fan there is a lot to like here. Players of the Jedi Knight series of PC games will feel right at home, once you get used to the controls.There are some negatives to the game though. As noted in other reviews the voice acting isn't great, the control set takes getting used to and there are some glitches in the game. Those aside there is plenty for Star Wars fans to like, fighting along side Qui-gonn in levels, Saber training with Master Windu and battling Darth Maul, how bad can that be?"
5,Star Wars at it's best,this game is excellent. the level are challenging and exciting. force abillities are good and the use of the light saber are cool. after you beat a vouple levels you battle one of the jedi counsle members. on of the last levels is battling darth maul. the last level is a battle royale all the jedi master in a one-for-all battle. it is a very good game
4,Not a bad game at all!,"Whoevever says this is a bad game,there 100% wrong! This game has decent graphics for a Star Wars game, has a wonderful sountrack right out of Episode 1.The controls are pretty good, you control Ben`s lightsaber with the right thumbstick. There are 26 missions that are very well done. There are six force powers includeing Pull,Push,Jump and three other exciting powers. Practicly the only flaw is the game dose`nt take after the movie that much,there are only a few missions that do.This game deserves a A."
3,Good... but,"This is one of the funner Star Wars games. Obi Wan has great grapics.But... It is the easies game I've ever played, I beat within one week, I should have just rented it. It is a fun game thought"
3,"Buy if a fan, rent if not.","It's fun, especially if you are a fan of the Star Wars world.But, the graphics are pretty poor. Just bland, drap stuff. And the game stutters when Obi-wan puts away his light saber (kind of like Halo does when it loads areas/checkpoints, if you are familiar with that game, only worse).I'd buy it before I'd pick up Halo, but not before I'd buy Max Payne or Silent Hill 2."
2,Pretty Sub-Average Game with just a few nice surprises,"Aside from some of the really cool things that you can do with the ""force"" and decent controls, everything else about this game... The graphics look out-dated and non-Xboxish and you fight the same monsters over and over and over and over again in a very repetitive game. The voice-acting and CG movies are just plain bad.Avoid this game -- get Halo instead."
2,"Rent It, Don't buy it.","This game is a really good rental. Fun aspects like force powers and light saber battles make it interesting for about an hour. After that, the bad graphics, glitchy gameplay, and akward controls ruin it. The tutorial is the funnest part of this game. That's where you learn all of your jedi abilities.The camera angles are ridiculously frustrating. At one point you are forced to jump down a series of levels onto another platform. There's just one problem, you can't adjust the camera angle down. How stupid is that?"
4,you know nothing,this game rocks i'm not even the super freak starwars fan but I love this game the darth maul level is great and the 2 levels before the only reason why people say it's bad is because the first couple of levels are boring and they give up on it the begining of episode 1 was boring to so there's you're answer and there isn't really a force defend you put force in you're lightsaber that reflect enemy hits and the slow motion rocks but there's a cool bug in the game if you're force meter is 1/2way downhold down the force botton and throw you're lightsaber if you press the slowmotion when you're saber comes back it will last the whole level I like playing the level before darth maul in slo mo anyway much better than jedi outcast2 for xbox
5,This looks like the best Star Wars title for a console!,This game looks awesome. The graphics that I have seen lately on this game are much better than what i saw earlier this year. The gameplay looks very fun. Who wouldn't want to play as Obi-Wan and chop up bad guys.
4,Force is with this game!,This game looks so sweet. I reserved it because it factors in all of the things that happens in the movie and more. This is definetely one of the XBox's best games out now!
1,gamerX review,"I played the x box and the first game i wanted to play was obi-wan but it was the suckiest game of all time. The only thing that had changed was the graphics the game is just like jedi battles for (ps,dc)."
2,RENT IT! DO NOT BUY IT.,I always rent games before I buy so I dont waste 60.00 bucks. Well if you are a hard core gammer like myself you will beat the game in a couple days max. So for 5 bucks I beat the game and was not Impressed one bit. However my 3 yr. old son loves the game but he even prefers fusion frenzy to this game. And remember rent them before you buy them.
2,"Buggy, Ugly, and Repetitive","This game crashed twice on me in my first day of playing it. There have also been several points where the character gets trapped in weird shaking sequences that are hard to break out of; major object detection problems in the engine. The game gets repetitive real quick when it becomes obvious that you'll be wandering around monotonous corridors waving your light saber at enemies that look exactly the same. Speaking of looks, each character in this game is made of about 11 polygons. Obi Wan has a flat spot on his head that you could set a coffee table on. Animation is ugly too, arms don't seem like they are attached to torsos. Voice acting is horrendous, the fake Ewan McGregor voice sounds like it belongs in The Rocky Horror show. I would avoid this game."
5,A Fantasy 25 Years In The Making,"So I was an eight-year-old boy when the original Star Wars came out. And like any good little boy, I loved space ships, sword fights, and big explosions. But all in the same movie??? And sword blades made from LASERS??? Somehow, George Lucas dove right into my brain and took the scraps of my imagination to whip together a movie.But there was always one thing missing -- I never got a real light saber to play with. Well, now I do. And for that reason alone, despite some flaws, Obi-Wan gets five stars. And most of my free time."
4,Worth playing,"Just finished Obi-Wan and overall I was happy with it. It's a blast to go through the Star Wars world, cutting droids in half and using force powers to throw objects, etc. I was basically addicted to it for the two weeks it took me to get through it (playing for a couple of hours at a time). The length was about right, although I was a little sad to finish it (always a sign of a good game). Gameplay does take some getting used to, but I got the hang of it pretty quickly. It probably could be a bit more difficult, but I appreciate that I never threw the controller in frustration. Graphics are so-so and sounds are decent. Not a bad game, give it a shot."
5,Exactly what i was looking for,I wanted to buy this game for my brother for Christmas. It came in wonderful condition and the shipping was a lot faster than i expected. It was exactly what i wanted.
3,Pretty good,"This game is pretty good. It has many good things about it, but also many flaws. It is very cool how you fight. You dont press a button and it does the moves for you like in most games, but you actually choose the way youre going to hit with the analog stick. It has a pretty good plot line. Probably the worst part of it is its graphics. These are not the graphics you can expect from an Xbox game. Its more like computer graphics. Also, it gets a little old playing with the same person. I mean I know the game is about Obi-Wan, but it just gets a little boring. Most games like this let you pick a different jedi once in a while or any time you want. Two player is pretty fun, it adds that part of a game where you can play with someone else instead of other people having to just sit around and watch. Overall a pretty good game."
1,not a real import,"DO NOT BUY THE IMPORT: It is just the domestic version with a Japanese lyric booklet inside, the discs are made in the USA, the packaging is made in the USA, etc, although it has a ""Made in Japan"" sticker on the outside its just a US export being sold as an Japan import."
4,Good Book,"This is an interesting book. The story of the evolution of the repeating and later self-loading rifles weaves together divergent and often conflicting priorities, biases and technologies.It's nicely covered and makes a fascinating story - assuming you are interested in antique marshal arms. Detailed photographs are a plus. The author has another volume that covers German rifle development up to 1870 - apparently though not available in English.This book suffers from an awkward, probably too literal, translation into English that could have used another heavy edit or two. Also at one point several paragraphs are repeated. More sloppy editing."
5,Highest Recommendation,"Finally a universal remote that is easy to setup and includes all of the functionality from my collection of remotes. The universal remotes I have tried previously only allowed easy setup of the most commonly used functions from each remote. With the website setup, all commands are downloaded from the web into the remote. The default setup for each component is good enough, but even the little bit of customization I wanted to do was easy. Plus, I was really surprised that every single component in my collection was available from the setup website."
3,Nice remote - but only if you have lots of batteries!,"I got the refurbished version of this from Amazon, and I did like it.It felt pretty good in my hand, and managed to program itself tocontrol all of my 6-7 components.However, I did realize after a couple of weeks, that it would go through myAAA rechargeable (750mah) batteries in one week. I could not see myselfhaving to recharge, and replace the batteries once per week. I can't imagine thecost for regular AAA batteries for this remote control for a year or two or three.The LCD screen is always on wasting energy, and the pretty blue lightsfor the whole remote are also a waste of energy, which I never used."
4,Worth the money,"Don't believe a remote control could be worth as much as this costs? Neither did I, until a few weeks ago. It takes some time to program - mostly finding the serial numbers on all your electronic equipment and figuring out exactly what settings everything needs to be on - but once that's set up, it works very well. I have mine controlling a tv and dvd/speaker system, and I set one up for my parents that controls their tv, dvd player, cd player, cable box, and vcr. It's particularly good when you have relatives who are not, shall we say, technologically adapt, as you can switch between various functions with literally one press of the button."
3,Worked fine for a while,"This remote has worked fine for a couple of years. However, I recently switched from cable to satellite TV and therefore need to update the remote to deal with the new equipment. In the past such updates have worked well. However, now that I've switched to Windows 7 on my PC, my PC will no longer recognize the remote (""USB device not recognized"").I've tried all the suggestions I can find on the Internet (disabling firewall and anti-virus software, downloading the latest version of the Logitech software, using different USB ports, using safe-mode for the remote, new batteries, etc.), but the result is the same - it's not recognized. So my very expensive Logitech remote is now good only as a paperweight. You would think that Logitech would provide some support for such an expensive item, but they want $29 for a phone consultation! Not acceptable, in my opinion."
3,Good but not great,"This is a good remote for universal capabilities. Pretty much controls all my devices and I am able to customize the menu to my preference.One thing I do not like is that I own a PS3 which utilizes Bluetooth technology for its remote and this remote does not control the PS3 for that very reason.Now for the reason I gave this remote 3 stars. I am deducting 1 star for each time the remote has died on me. First time I lost all USB connectivity. Second time the LCD display went out. So we'll see if the next holds up. Hopefully this is just an isolated issue.One thing I do want to make clear is when calling Logitech they have been extremely helpful, friendly and more than willing to help. So besides the hardware issues, this customer services speaks volumes of itself and will keep me coming back.......One last thing these remotes are not for the non-tech savvy people... They are highly customizable and take A LOT of patience and ""Trial&Error;""."
3,"Well, it finally works...","I consider myself a techie and this thing takes time to configure. There is no way on God's green earth that my parents could figure this thing out. End of story. After three hours of working on the remote, it works great! Several times throughout the process I was ready to smash the thing against the wall."
3,Great Complicated Device,"I purchased this product approximately 1 year and 3 months ago. I use it for my DVD Player, TV, Stereo, and DVR. At first I marveled at the genius of the device and its support for so many devices. The ability to update all of this info into the remote via PC is amazing. I was excited to use it, however, I learned that its not a very fun remote.The buttons are hard, making it difficult to locate the frequently used ones. The programable buttons (""Watch TV"", ""Watch a Movie""...etc.) rarely turn on and off the appropriate equipment. The help button rarely fixes the mistakes. Other used buttons are located deep into the remotes menu's and are not quickly accesible.Although I bought this to avoid using 4 remotes, now I seem to be using 5 remotes.The reason for the 3 stars is because I paid $200 for this and its shot down in price drastically so it may be worth it. Just realize that this remote can be a pain in the ...!"
1,Defective out of the box; poor support,"Right out of the box the remote failed. It was supposed to include a CD, but the CD was missing. The firmware failed to update from both a Mac and a PC. Online support was useless, and when I called tech support, the non-English speaking tech didn't even ask me what model I had or what the problem was, but started asking questions about what my TV and DVD models were. Once they heard that the firmware couldn't be upgraded, they queued me up to level 2 support, at which point the call was disconnected. Three (*three*) days later, I received an email with a 10-step procedure (honestly, 10 steps) for how to reset the firmware. At that point I boxed it up and sent it back."
2,Universal Remote?,This product did not live up to expectations. It did not work on my system which includes a ReplayTV DVR. The product does not recognize it and the help desk could not help to set it up. I finally returned the item.
2,Love the remote... when it was working!,"I loved this remote for all the reasons listed by others. It's easy to program, easy to use and a great, small erogonimic design. My only problem with it is that the top optional buttons around the screen have given up. They gradually became harder and harder to push to make work until they stopped working altogether. Logitech's support was completely unhelpful in resolving the issue. The remote is pretty useless now, as the buttons that work the TiVo are no longer functionaly on the remote. Very disappointing. I hope that the higher end models do not have this problem as well."
1,challenging,"This was very difficult to program. It took many calls to tech support. Finally after getting it programmed, it did not work as cleanly as I thought it would. For some of the misc devices you would have to scroll though many menu pages to access certain functions. I ended up returning it as I was unhappy with its performance."
1,No longer supports TV listings,I was pleased with both remotes although on one the channel and volume buttons died but Harmony in their wisdom decided to eliminate the TV listings on all their models out of the blueI called customer support and the representative told me they were no longer providing that service and although she admitted receiving numerous complaints had no intention on restoring it.With that kind of attitude and lack of support i DO NOT recommend any Harmony product.
1,This could be the worst product ever,"Stop, don't order this. It's a piece of junk. I spent hours and hours trying to configure it to my very simple entertainment system and it would not work. I see the vision. I see the value proposition. Just enough to taste it, but this product does NOT deliver. The set up interface on the Internet is clunky at best and it won't even toggle between inputs correctly on a simple Samsung DLP tv. If you have 3 remotes, you are better using those 3. Even if you have 10 remotes, you will be less frustrated than using this piece of junk! Here's a clue for the product designers - try using it before you package it up all nice and neat.Thank god for a great return policy by Amazon. Or I would be out $100! Logitech should pay me at least 10 times that for pain and suffering..."
1,will not operate DVR,"Will not operate a DirecTV Dvr, a piece of junk in my opinion. And, Logitech will not refund! I got ripped on this one."
5,Wonderful Device!,"This Logitech Harmony 659 remote is the absolute best universal remote ever! We're using ours to put together a TV, DVD player, AV receiver, and cable box. Setup is a breeze with all the software, wires, and batteries right out of the box. Use the included CD-ROM to put in the model numbers of your items, and how you use them. In under 20 minutes you will be using your AV setup like a pro! This product is highly recommended!"
4,Great Remote - Poor Tech Support,"The remote itself is great. I love having one remote that can replace my current 4 remotes. The only complaint is that their tech support is poor. I spent quite a bit of time on hold waiting for an operator until I was forced to leave a message. I was told that I would receive a phone call back by the end of the day only to receive a call the next day. I was pretty upset that I am expected to try and get the remote to work during THEIR schedule. One must question whether the instructions are too many issues, the instructions are not always clear, or they just don't want to staff their support correctly. It is a great remote as long as you are confident that you won't have any problems....otherwise good luck!"
2,If only it had a charging cradle,"This would have probably been the coolest thing our living room had ever seen if we had ever been able to use it with regularity. Everything about it works well, and I spent the better part of an hour when we first got it ""teaching"" it how to tune our various devices. Unfortunately, this remote went through batteries faster than any piece of electronics I've ever owned. At least once a week, we would pick it up to find that it appeared to be on, but didn't have enough juice to send an adequate signal to one or more of our devices. The cost of the remote was hard to justify to my wife, and the cost and hassle of constantly replacing batteries was worse. We've since gone back to our regular TiVo remote and a remote for the DVD player, and we don't miss the 659 at all."
1,Terrible build quality,"I had this remote for less than 9 months before it stopped working entirely. It's fine as a remote, although the software is finicky in connecting to the remote for updates. However, one day it wouldn't connect to the computer at all and within a week, the remote wouldn't power on. Not worth it unless you can get it for pennies on the dollar."
2,Good remote but quality is lacking,Its another marvelous Harmony remote. If you dont know about Harmony remotes - well they will save your marriage if you have a complex home AV setup. They make operating your AV super easy. All of them are great except the 659 has had some serious quality control issues. So I recommend getting one of the many other models.
3,Average remote for the price,"You've probably been doing a lot of research on this remote if you're reading reviews. So let's get to the point. I've paid less than $40 because it's an older model compare to Logitech's new lineups.Like:Customization through USB cable via the internet. Awesome, you can pick and choose the functions you want and in the orders to your liking.Dislike:'Play','Rew','FF','Rec','Pause' and 'Stop' buttons are loacted at the very bottom of the remote. As a result, when you use those functions, you will be holding the remote at a very awkward position as if the remote is very unbalance.NO buttons or options to turn on/off for L/R speakers. A necessary feature if you're watching foreign film and you need 'English' language only and not both foreign language AND English simultaneously.Good luck on your research and may you find the best remote for the best price. It really helps doing your homework."
3,Worked great for 2 years...,"After 2 years the top left soft button doesn't work. The volume up doesn't work either. The buttons are cheaply made and do wear out. The thing eats batteries too.A lot has been made of the software. Well, its a great idea but there are some things to consider.1) You can setup the lcd commands how you want but the software will rearrange them for you however it chooses.2) It is a pain to get it to do the power buttons (lots of wizards).3) I couldn't get it to synchronize volume with my tv speakers and amp.With all that said it is still a pretty good remote. If the online software worked better and allowed me more control I'd probably replace this failing one with a new one. As it is, I just get grief from the wife because I can't get some commands to show up on the first screen."
4,My husband had to have it,"I could not justify spending this much money on a friggin' remote. My husband had to have it. Now that he has set it up and showed me how it worked, I use it like a champ. I do not like having to change batteries so frequently - about once a month. The other thing I don't like is how slippery it is. I drop the darn thing or it slips off the couch on a daily basis. It seems too expensive of an item to have it crashing on the floor, however, it has proved very durable. I like that my 5 year old can use it. After reading other people's reviews, it makes me appreciate it more. Now I am going to see if our air conditioner will respond to this thing. I certainly CAN get off the couch to change the temp but if this thing will do it, WHY NOT? :)"
5,A magically relaxing CD for young and old,"Bronn Journey's beautiful harp music will leave you in awe. This talented musician has hit the nail on the head with a nighttime CD that is sure to send you (and your kids)off to dreamland in no time flat. I received it as a gift while on bedrest, and my young twins still drift off to sleep listening to it every night. I've heard this CD several times a day for two years now, and love it just as much as day one. I recommend buying it in both CD and tape, so you'll never be caught without it."
5,Baby book,Great fathers day gift. Good read for my 8 month old daughters. Would not recommend for children over 1 yr because of the simple content.
5,Very cute book.,"My child loves reading this with his dad. It is nice to have a loving book to read between father and son that is not just about sports, tools or trucks."
4,Daddy Like,"I wanted a simple book that I could read to my son, and one that showed him that I loved him. Being a father can some times leave you feeling marginalized by society. I enjoy any media that gives good examples of fathers doing what they do best: Loving their child. It's short, but it's sturdy. Sometimes that's just what you need."
2,Awkward to read..,It may be just me but I like children books that rhyme. This is a book about counting and I'm hoping it will grow on me. My little one isn't ready for counting just yet so I'm not sure if she likes it!
4,Love Karen Katz!!,Another wonderful addition to your toddler library. My little girl loves all the Karen Katz books and brings them too me to read before bed time. Great choice!
2,Ok book,"This book is not a family favorite, but is a nice book. The text is very short on all pages. Additionally, there are 4 blank pages, the fist two and last two have only a graphic pattern. This does not even count the publisher information page so its ends up being almost as many pages with words/pictures as filler pagers. It is very, very similar to ""Mommy Hugs"" so would not recommend buying both. Not a bad book, but not much that stands out when there are so many outstanding board books to choose from."
3,"Fans of ""hi-tech"" metal may like this..","Well they took a stab at Fear Factory style futuristic metal and do a pretty decent job of it. They hammer chugging guitars along with double bass kick in a machine like fashion, shave off most of the solos and have a brutal bark mixed with somewhat strained ""clean"" vocals. Sadly they come 9 years after Demanufacture and are overall much worse in basically every way.(Unless you like metalcore, they're closer to that than FF are)"
4,Mnemic at their best,"This was Mnemic at their absolute best. Polyrhytmns, catchy groove riffs, and beautifully crafted vocals and overall musicianship. They obviously have an intrinsic love for what Meshuggah started. Highly recommended. I would also recommend Sons of the System and Mnemesis, fantastic records."
3,"first half=good, second=bad","I picked up The Audio INjected Soul and I thought it was the f***ing revolution for metal, so I bought this. This album is mind blowing up until after DB'XXd, that's where the album goes drastically down hill. It's boring, cliche'd. There are like 2 good songs scattered through what I like to call the 'second half'.If you mind blowing metal, get Audio Injected Soul. If you don't mind paying 11 dollars for 6 genious songs, and can sit through some serious crap, then get this also."
2,A REALLY IRRITATING BOOK...,"...within the text there exist so many arbitrary statements (such as Dr. Ps' belief that he has been chosen by God to lead the world into a scientific era of revelation, that modern science is dogma, ect., ect.) and arbitrary number tricks(that Plichta has stolen from old math-game-books, and claimed authorship of), that Dr. Plichta can be generally considered a fanatic without any merit at all. The mathmatics within, though completely unrelated to the prime number code, are interesting enough to make the reader come back out of no reason more than interest. However, Dr. Ps' negative attitudes towards modern physics and his delusions of being the greatest mind of all time, tend to irritate me. I recomend this book only to extremists who have completely shut the doors of open mindedness toward modern science."
1,amusing junk,Sometimes the ramblings of a man whose ambitions are beyond his talents are nonetheless educational. You will have to be the judge.
1,What can I say that hasn't already been said . . .,"This book really has only two flaws: 1) The author is extremely full of himself, and 2) The entire book acts as a kind of prelude for some ""earth-shattering"" discovery concerning prime numbers - a discovery which the reader is left anticipating after finishing the last paragraph. All that egotistical buildup, but to what end? Don't waste your time on this one. (Not to mention, the silver lettering on the paperback edition rubs off quite easily, my spine looks like God's S____e_ ____ula, even though it spent only one day in my hands)"
1,"For God's sake, don't waste your time on this drivel!","This book is nothing more than the ravings of a bitter man who obviously thinks quite a lot of himself. There are two possibilities: 1) Plichta is a genius beyond Einstein and nobody else on the planet is smart enough to see it, or 2) he is a pathetic, average-intelligence man who believes that he has solved all of science where the rest of humanity over all of history has not. I am putting my money on #2. This book is, however, an interesting case-study on how humans can delude themselves into seeing patterns everywhere and in everything when they have no real significance. Plichta takes several numerical examples from physics and biology and attaches all sorts of divine and mystic significance to them. Essentially it is worthless 'numerology', and shows how, in a large enough sampling of items, you can always find the odd example to support your wild claim."
1,Misunderstands Judaism & Justification,"James Dunn in this volume demonstrates the willingness characteristic of New Perspective scholars to value the contribution of any other source, even rabbinnic sources of the 2nd and 3rd centuries, above the New Testament. This is worse than rejecting inerrency - it is rejecting the NT as a primary source for the first century! Even if Dunn's reinterpretation of Paul were true (which it isn't), he would still have to account for the woes pronnounced by Jesus in Matthew 23. Sounds like legalism to me!"
2,Community Service,"In books like Rich Dad, Poor Dad, the author wrote about returning to society what one has reaped. In this book, Mr. Graham attempts to do it the other way round - almost. Build your brand from the community side. Market yourself as trustworthy and let the word of mouth spreads and presumably good things will come to bear.While the examples were very inspiring, many of them African Americans, the concepts and ideas are not new. One get a sense of deja vu if you have read 7 Habits of Highly Effective People and the likes."
5,Amazing Pre-Giuliani New York Film,"I was interesting in seeing this movie, so I added it to my Wish List. Then, the next morning I went to my ""Free Movie"" list on Comcast and there it was listed as ""Order of Death"". I wanted to see it basically because I am a Huge fan of Harvey Keitel. He was extraordinary as always, however, co-starring Johnny Rotten? I assumed very bad acting, however, he was INCREDIBLE!!! Being a fan of the Sex Pistols has nothing to do with it (Besides, I more leaned towards Sid). Even though I have already seen it, I still have to own it. I am keeping it on my wishlist. The price presently being $0.98, are you kidding me??? Even it you hate it, it's the same price as a rental! Go for it. Actually I think I will NOW! :-)"
3,aka Copkiller,"Gray market discs such as this offer no commentary, deleted scenes or other bonus features. Dubs are ""best available source"" and can vary from very good to only fair.CORRUPT LIENTENANTStars Harvey Keitel and punk rocker Johnny Rotten. Keitel is a country music-loving NYC detective who imprisons and tortures cop-killer Johnny, but the masochistic creep-o only begs for more abuse. An odd, violent little movie.Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 imdb viewer poll rating.(5.6) Corrupt Lieutenant (""Copkiller"") (Italy-1983) - Harvey Keitel/John Lydon/Nicole Garcia/Leonard Mann/Sylvia Sidney"
3,"It was just ok, video quality is terrible though","It is an old, average movie. Im glad I got a chance to see it, but wouldnt watch it again."
5,wow,As a first time foreign film watcher. This movie blew my mind. Had me sitting on the edge of my seat during the whole movie. Would recommend this movie to anyone that has never seen a foreign film. The sound track was just as great as the movie itself
4,Talented!,"I never heard of the group Bandits until after I saw this movie. It was great! The music was fantastic and the acting was superb, considering they are musicians. These women are very talented!"
5,Not your typical subtitled movie!!!,"To bad I was not well informed in my youth!!! This movie was phenominal! Not only was the plot very well paced but the music was incredible (I bought the soundtrack too!). What I found interesting that the movie was done in German and was subtitled in English but ALL of the songs were done in English. What I also found surprising is that all the songs were done by the actresses and they WERE NOT AND NEVER WERE A GROUP! They could have been a very, very GOOD all girl rock band! Do an IMBD search of Bandits to get a synopsis of the plot and all I can say is GET THE MOVIE and find the soundtrack if you can!"
3,A Hard Day's Nicht,"A generally entertaining rock 'n' roll musical fantasy/chase film/dramedy from Germany that starts off with the energy and promise of another ""Trainspotting"" or ""Run Lola Run"" but unfortunately can't keep up that pace.To her credit, the director quickly dispatches with the ""Caged Heat"" cliches by wisely removing our heroines from thier prison environment and into the ""riot grrls on the run"" storyline almost immeadiately. ""Bandits"" loses serious steam in the third act, where the cinematic influences hinted at early on (""Butch Cassidy & the Sundance Kid"", ""The Blues Brothers"")become too obvious with wholesale lifts of scene ideas from those other films (especially the final freeze frame).The original music is good, and the visual/editing style is impressive. The director certainly appears to be someone to keep an eye on. By no means a classic, but worth a look."
5,I think this book looks like the best thriller.,I think this book looks like the best thriller so far besides my favorite one the House Of Death. I think the boy on the front is Sam. From the descriptions in Stranded the latest SVU he fits perfectly.
3,It's ok I guess,"This is ok, but I did not find it keeping me on the edge nor I was breathless when I finished it. The truely best SV thrillers I've read are Killer at sea and stranger in the house, & Killer on board"
5,A delight for all,"I am buying my fourth copy of this CD and two others of Pandolfi's: my mother-in-law wants them for her new Bose CD player and my two COLLEGE students want them for the dorm! Obviously, our whole family loves all of Pandolfi's music. They know he is my favorite pianist and the teenagers often put his CDs on to keep me calm! The beauty and clarity of his playing is so soothing. You can imagine my delight and surprise when the 18 and 20 year olds asked for his CDs for Christmas!"
5,Fantastic,"this is some of the best piano music I've heard for quite some time -- just a piano, nothing else."
5,"Very useful for those who are interested in yoga, pranayama and meditation","In my opinion, this book is a great choice for those who would like to practise the Breathwalk system - everything is very clearly explained and it is possible to start exercising right away. I have tried some of the methods decribed and found them very appropriate for my situation as I walk for about an hour every day anyway and now I can add some variety and meaning to my habitual activity."
5,A truly revitalizing experience.,"This review is about the experience of doing Breathwalk as taught in the book. First it was easy to understand and learn. But, the results are the amazing part. When I pass other walkers with their head sets, weights, intense paces and faces and realize this is their excercise and relaxation, I feel lucky to have learned a technique that is both enegizing, relaxing, and elevating at the same time. All the scientific background information gave the whole thing validity which helped me want to learn it. Thanks for this book!"
4,Love it!,"Have had this product for about 4-5 years. It is an excellent salad dressing mixer (carafe included). But I also beat eggs with it. It is very handy for mixing drinks as well. The batteries need to be changed when it begins to slow down, but don't have any complaints with this product."
2,Broke after 3 days!,"I give it 2 stars because it does mix beautifully but I stop there because the dang thing broke from falling off the first shelf in my refrigerator. I bought it on Wednesday and it's now Saturday! Also, it is NOT air tight because the lid flew right off as well. There is now a big gigantic hole in the middle of the mixer. What the heck! Piece of junk, as far as longevity goes."
3,Okay product,The rack itself was fine but the nails included in the package were useless. The screws were too short to make a solid grip in the wall. I had to use my own screws to get it firmly attached to the wall.
5,Great!,"I enjoyed doing business with this seller. I emailed them and they responded in a timely manner and the book got here even before I expected. The book was in the condition as stated it would be, if not better."
4,Great for kids,"I got these for my 5 year old son. He watches the UFC with me and we like to rough house from time to time. With the gloves I can play with him while teaching him how to box a little as well and he LOVES it. They work really well for his age, they are easy on and off. I would recommend these to any kid who likes to rough house, likes to fight and play rough."
2,Too Small,"I bought this for my 7 years old on his birthday. I thought it would be a great gift for him because he loves boxing, but they were too small for his hands. It might fit a 5 year old but even though my 7 year old's hands are small it was still too small even for him. The gloves are made with good material and do not look cheap. I would make sure to keep your receipts so you can return them if they don't fit."
1,Poor quality!,"Unfortunately, my kids never got a chance to use it. The ball's outer shell blew apart when I was pumping it with air (not the rubber lining but the cheap leather and stitching that covers it). Maybe I received a defective one? However, I doubt it.... The whole thing looked and felt cheap from the moment I opened the box. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!"
5,Well worth the price,Bought these to go along with a boxing robot punching bag. My son didnt get a chance to use them on the robot( it was a cheap toy) but the gloves work great on dad! My son loves them.
4,Good for small hands.,"They fit my 7-year old son's hands pretty well. They're a bit difficult for him to get on but are effective for him to use with his punching bag, with some room to grow. They seem well-padded and durable, although we've only had them a few months."
3,Cheap gloves,I was suprised by how mis-shaped these were when we got them. The stuffing was strange. They're for my 6 year old and appear to fit him as expected (a little big). They do what they're supposed to though. Would only purchase these in person again.
3,"Good size, but not enough pockets","The size of this bag is good - large enough to hold a medium size laptop but not so big that it becomes unmanageable. There are slip pockets on both outer walls, slip pockets of various sizes on the inside, and a separate section inside for the laptop. However, I would have liked to have at least a couple of zipped pockets for more secure storage, including one on the outside and one inside. Since it didn't have those I rated it 3 stars. If you don't have a need for separate zip pockets, it's a great bag and a beautiful color."
2,smaller than I thought.,"Was looking for the green and white, got the green and beige even though it said on my order form white. Didn't fit the 15"" laptop, guess I should have used the actual measurements anyway. In the end, I returned it but really like Lowepro stuff."
4,Descent into madness...,"SPOILER ALERT!I'll keep this one short and sweet. I really liked this story. I have not yet read The Dark Half, so, I don't know how close it is to that, but I really thought this was a good example of a story that very subtly leads you (along with the main character) down the path of madness. So subtly, in fact, that you (like the story's protagonist) don't really see what's happening until you get toward the end and turn around and look back at what you've just been through. I liken it to The Yellow Wallpaper by Charlotte Perkins Gilman, in that respect (and forgive me if I'm mistaken here, it's been years since I read that one).So why 4 out of 5 stars? I gotta tell you, I didn't like the supernatural element thrown in at the very end (the hat and letter found by the ex-wife). I thought this story would be much more effective (scary) if it was all simply Mort's doing. Otherwise, a good read."
4,NYC as alien saw,It is perspective of daily New York City business through eyes of extraterrestrial alien unable speaking but understanding the locals well and some funny lovemaking involved.
3,"Oh Brother: Comedy, Sci Fi, and Social Commentary","Joe Morton is sensational as a black mute alien escapee from enslavement on another world. He crashes into New York harbor and finds employment fixing broken video games. He is pursued by two really hokey aliens. Morton's grin is infectious. There's a wonderful morning-after scene, when his night's companion tells him he needs to get his toenails cut.This is a camp classic for sci fi & fantasy buffs. Not in the same league as The Day the Earth Stood Still or Forbidden Planet, but certainly on the next level.And I can't find it anymore in my local video stores."
5,"Oldy and a ""Goody""",I have always loved this movie. A blast from the past starring Joe Morton. Enjoyed watching it on my Kindle Fire HD7 even though it was not in HD.
5,A Story of Humanity and Survival - Don't Miss It!,"Based on a novel by James Clavell, King Rat tells the story of life in a Japanese prisoner of war camp during World War II. This was Clavell's first international success, and it drew on the author's personal experience as a prisoner of war.Beautifully rendered, the film presents the humanity and inhumanity of people placed in extaordinary circumstances, and the spirit of survival inherent in us all.You simply don't want to miss all the insights into human nature the film brings to its audience. The script is brilliant, the direction sure and deft, and the acting superb. I highly recommend this film for anyone who enjoys intelligent film making at its best."
5,"A Gem, and Yes, Better Than Kwai","I missed the film when it was first released in 1965.I saw it recently and found it the best WWII prison film.I agree with David Thompson, it is Better ThanThe Bridge on the River Kwai!I've seen many George Segal's film over the years butthis is the first time that I found him a great actor indrama, and not only in comedies.In this gritty black & white film, he was supported a greatcast of British actors like John Mills, James Fox, JamesFox, etc.Brian Forbes who started as an actor and screen writerwas one of the best British directors in the '60sand this probably was his greatest achievement.It is survival story of prisoners of war which revealed men'stenacity and vulnerability under the most difficult conditions.A gem of a film."
4,I do like it!,A production of a good book converted into a movie which shows how strange things can get! How humans treat other humans.
4,King Rat,A underrated movie that deserves better. It is the Lord of the flies with adults playing the role of the children. It is the darker side of Stalag 17 with no happy or feel good ending. A reflection of the ugly side of the human face. The story we do not tell our children in how some adults behave in difficult times.
5,May be scary - but still some good qualities,"She may be scary, but there are some good qualities.I like the hair color shade she has.Althogh it sort of reminds me of Jade with dark hair.And her outfit is so cute!Just 1 look at that shirt and it blew me away.And she even has a masquerade mask."
5,Yasmin as a modern day witch!,"I was watching a show on the town of Salem, and there are actually modern day witches there! They look like this Yasmin doll! I love Yasmin! The dress is absolutly lovely. Everything is so wonderful; very very g0th, witch thing! I LOVE IT. A++(PLUS IT TEACHES YOU THAT NOT EVERYONE IS THE SAME!! :))"
1,They Look Goth & Evil,I think only adults should collect this I am A HUGE BRATZ fan but this 1 is like someone that hangs around the streets & does bad things I think kids would start to wear this & start bad habits they would get the idea of gangs & fights I LOVE BRATZ BUT THE BRATZ MIDNIGHT DANCES ARE UGLY I think mothers & fathers would like to burn these dollsBRATZ LOVERMY SCENE LOVERBARBIE LOVER~!~Catlover~!~
2,Yasmin has darker skin,"I don't like this doll much, it is supposed to be Yasmin but Yasmin has pulled a Michael Jackson and had her skin bleached or something. No, it is not Jade, Jade has slantier eyes because she is oriental. It just looks weird. If you didn't know it was meant to be Yasmin though it is not that ugly so I give it 2 stars."
1,BLEUGH!,"How gross! She is a GOTH! She is sooooooooo ugly! I love Bratz but i just don't like punky, gothy, vulgar things. which is why i don't like this monstrous horror!"
1,AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"What happened to Yasmin???????????She is sooooo ugly.She has ugly clothes and ugly hair color and make-up.I think that the Bratz dolls in this collection is soooooooooooooooooooooooooo wierd,except fianna.I dont like her clothes that much,but I think she is just okay.My favorite Bratz characters are Cloe and Jade.But this colletion is wierd.Thats my opinion.SARA SIBLINI!!!MY SCENE LOVER!!!BRATZ LOVER!!!*FOREVER*"
5,Express your individuality,These dolls let kids and people express there individuality. They show kids that they can be different and wear different things. They can be unique and stand out. Kids are only kids for a short time LET THEM have fun. My daughter and I shop on this website and for some of you people out there to type such weird harsh stuff well it is rediculious. Think of the kids that get on here to type up a birthday or wish list and you are typing trashabout something that they think is cool. Think about that. You have your right to voice but please put apropriate words for kids.
2,goth ?,"Well actually this doll isn't really THAT goth. I mean it's dark blue. She looks a little like the punk dolls, wich are OK.I like her little nick nacks that come with her. The mask is awesome! But to tell the truth i think this doll is a teensy bit out there. You know what I mean?"
2,um hello,"Why make a goth doll 4 girls? The desciption on the box made it sound like they were going to summon a demon though dancing. Plus they have evil, murderous looks on their faces... Not something for little girls."
1,SHE SUX,THIS IS NOT YASMIN YASMIN IS TANNED AND NOT PAIL AND HAS TANBROWN HAIR NOT BLACK AND BLUE THIS IS A CHEAT IT IS JADE GET OVER IT.
1,This Doll is Disgusting,This doll and the rest of the Midnight Dance line is unbearable. These dolls look like devil worshipers and should not be out on the market. I love Bratz but I will not be buying these ones.
5,Great fun,All of the midnight dance bratz are not goth like and they are very fun to play with many people say barbie's could beat these bratz but I think they are just as fun to play with as barbie's.I don't know how people could think they are a bad influence to kids because they are pretty much the same as barbie's.
5,I like Yasmin but no she is not the best,"She is not better then the other Bratz girls. They are all great the same way. I like Cloe better, but that doesn't mean she is better. But I do think this Yasmin is cool. My favorite in the Midnight Dance collection is Fianna though, but I do like her. Yasmin isn't the best but she is still cool."
2,Mitts only didn't receive gloves.,"Pro: Its cheap which is good for once an awhile fun, and its durable.Con: Well it alright for beginner, but for someone serious i wouldn't recommend it. The three holes for your fingers kind of hurt and It doesn't sit in your hands very well. For its price and for someone who won't take it to seriously its a good buy, but if your looking to get in to boxing i would recommend spending a little more."
3,Uncomfortable mitts,"My kids love the gloves, but the mitts are uncomfortable to wear. The finger dividers on the mitts press down between your fingers. I can't wear the mitts too long at a time."
3,The Firm are good - The Law are too!,"This is good stuff - worth 3 very strong stars! Paul Rodgers (ex Free, ex Bad Company) has one of the best voices in the business. The rest of the band are Jimmy Page (ex Led Zeppelin), Tony Franklin (later to join John Sykes' Blue Murder), and Chris Slade who became AC/DC's drummer later on. The music can be described as a hybrid between Bad Company and Led Zeppelin. Outstanding songs are: ""Radioactive"", ""Closer"", ""Midnight moonlight"" and a good version of ""You've lost that loving feeling"".Rodgers went on after a follow up album: ""Mean business"", and formed a band (?) called The Law. They released a self titled album (before they quit) that is equally good as this one by The Firm. You might find The Law difficult to get, but keep on looking - it's a gem!"
4,Artists explore new things.,"My experience with musicians that create new sound and songs pursue it for their own satisfaction. Once a sound is created many can copy it but finding that sound is the work. Maybe the listeners circa 1980's found the Firms sound not what they expected. When I combine the music offered to me from that generation I find this album stands above many. I wish the ""Bad Company and Led Zeppelin"" sound could go on forever with new material offered every couple years but that wasn't meant to be. Thank God for Pink Floyd and Jethro Tull. It just takes the right combination of individuals to bring a sound back with new material. Listen to the Allman Brothers lately? Fantastic recreation!I accept this album for it's time capsule sound and I enjoy a break once in a while from the 21st century."
5,Excellent 80s CD By Ex-Members Of Led Zep And Bad Co.,"THE FIRM is an excellent 80s recording by former members of Led Zeppelin (lead guitarist Jimmy Page) and Bad Company (lead singer/guitarist Paul Rodgers), plus Manfred Mann's Earth Band drummer Chris Slade and unknown bassist/keyboardist Tony Franklin. The album, along with the first couple of Robert Plant solo albums, indicates what direction Led Zeppelin might have taken had drummer John Bonham not drank himself to death in September of 1980. The best songs here are ""Radioactive"" and ""Satisfaction Guaranteed"", but the overall quality is very high. The only lowpoints are ""Midnight Moonlight"" and a cover version of the Righteous Brothers' ""You've Lost That Lovin' Feeling"", both of which are totally unnecessary. These are just minor issues, as the rest of the CD is great, vintage-style rock, a rarity in an era of Duran Duran and Robert Palmer."
2,Boring,This album would put me to sleep if it wasn't for the over loud 80's style drum sound. What a mess.
3,Average...,"Propelled mostly by Paul's soulful vocals,rather than Page's restrained playing,the joint venture of these two legends manages to rise above average;however,Tony Franklin's bass sounds annoying.With a different bass sound,this could have been A material."
1,Biggest rip-off in the rock and roll industry today,"An absolutely lackluster effort from some very talented musicians.I gotta say, I could have used a little more cowbell."
3,"Not horrible, but...","Looking back, so much more was expected from this union of Jimmy Page and Paul Rodgers and if the remainder of the CD could have been as electric as ""Radioactive"" we'd have had a good thing going; but it almost seems like we ended up with a quick cash grab and several songs that weren't good enough to save for later solo projects. Not a bad listen, but don't set the bar too high."
3,"Good, but not special","Paul Rodgers and Jimmi Page together. What can we expect from this? A good job, off course. Sometimes it sounds like Led Zeppelin, because of Jimmi guitars. Good CD. The second The Firm CD, Main Busines, is better."
4,Classic Rock Sound,"Paul Rodgers and Jimmy Page's collaboration, their first studio effort as a team, displays a stripped down, straight ahead rock sound that is smoother than Zepplelin probably would have sounded (in the 80's) yet bluesier than Bad Company material. Although this effort received only mediorcre comercial success and was not admired by the critics at the time, fans of either band would certianly be pleased with this effort. ""Radioactive"" received decent airplay in it's prime, but this album offers more, thanks to Page's creativity and Rodgers' outstanding vocal work."
5,Words and music move you through a range of emotions.,All I can say is that I have loved this album since it came out. Great for when you're in or out of love.
4,A bold challenging and visionary film with small problems,"In light of the recent Oscar win for Hillary Swank, this film becomes grander in its significance. Midi Onodera had the courage to not only talk about transexuality, homosexuality, fetishism and drag culture in her film but her casting choices were just as courageous. Her lead, Keram Malicki-Sanchez is not only playing a woman who feels she is a man trapped in a woman's body, but Keram actually IS, in reality a male actor. Although the film has the usual problems with pacing, lighting and storyline that many first time low-budget independents run into, this is a remarkably bold, powerful film, and, considering the time in which it was released, the cast and its creators should be acknowledged for undertaking such a daunting task."
2,"muddled and idiosyncratic theory of ""spirit""","I hoped this book would offer a solid definition of ""spirituality"" and an attempt to survey a difficult area, already plagued by too many idiosyncratic definitions and approaches. This is one more; the author severs ""psyche"" from ""spirit,"" then has trouble placing Jung and Grof and many others clearly writing about ""both,"" or rather, refusing to make this separation. A more basic problem for scholars in religion, psychology and cultural studies is the author's wanting to have his cake- an intrinsic, essential, trans-cultural core of ""spirituality"" that is more primordial than any religion - and eat it too, by incorporating specific cultural/religious constructs into his definition of the above. Frustrating, and the charts and diagrams to not help."
1,"Good effort, but not for amateurs","Good effort , but not for amateurs. This book was a giant disappointment, poor black and white photos, erroneus information, and poor explanation of jigs. Not enough detailed expalanations, especially for beginners.Many of the photos in this book were poorly done,Photos need to be in clear color with detailed information.Lots of spelling mistakes, and incomplete words . Measurements , were way off. the author used guitarmaking measurements for top , back and sides. The back of the book had photos of jigs, but no explanation of how to make them.I do not recommend this book . Have been woodworking for 33 years."
5,This Book Was all you could want in a Fantasy book!,This book was simply one of the best douglas Niles has ever written. It combines Suspense with the traditional Fantasy enviroment.At the end of the book you are compelled to go out and get the next book immediately!
4,Going way back for a good one,This was the first forgotten realms book I ever read when I was in HS. It got me hooked on these types of books. I never knew then that there were two more books in the series. After some research (I couldn't remember the title of this book) I found all three and ordered them. It is an older set but still a good one.
2,Not very good...,"This is pretty poorly written, with unoriginal characters and horrific editing. Its basically a poor rip from some old D&D; story.Do yourself a favor and read Greg Keyes (Briar King), George RR Martin or some Gemmell. This is a waste."
5,Amazing,"This book is full of action, loyalty, sacrifice and character development. Douglas Niles hit the jackpot this time, combining action with romance in such a way that one doesn't affect the other!"
2,Disappointing,"I have been consuming these Forgotten Realms books and I was quite excited to see the library had another one of the authors. But I found the book to be lacking, maybe it was after the RA Salvatore into for it that left me wanting. I found the characters shallow, very lacking in depth. The plot good, yes, but the rate of killing the NPCs...that gets a little old than just the masses of enemies."
1,A nice attempt at a novel,"As has been mentioned, Niles does have some good characters. The plot is also somewhat intriguing...but his poor writing skills leave the reader with the strong stench of melodramatic cheese. Poor sentence structure (""The wolves stormed the northmen. For they had come to destroy."" For Niles was a bad writer.) is all too prevalent in the book, and Niles amateurishly reveals the entire plot with his poor use of foreshadowing. His vocabulary includes some interesting words, but is limited in its breadth; thus one gets the feeling that they are reading the same paragraph over and over. Tristan, Robyn, and Darryth deserved better than Doug Niles."
1,Think like a quarterback and Pass!,"I purchased this book at the same time that I picked up the Crystal Shard. After I read this first I very nearly didn't get anything based in the Forgotten Realms.Niles, while an accomplished craftsman (being able to plot out what sounds like a great tale) is never really able to convert his passion to the paper. As a result the book is slow and plodding. There are no real surprises and the characters make no impression on you. Pass on this and get something [else]..."
1,Little value,"While the graphics isn't bad, the gameplay is rather lacking, with controlling the cars almost impossible. For a better racing game check out ""GT Advance Championship Racing""."
4,A lovely modern fable,"A sweet, fun, well-told, Damon Runionesque fable about a well meaning if pathetic theatrical manager who gets caught up with the mob. Perhaps it's not quite as amazing or ground-breaking as Allen's very best films, but there's a touching, gentle, funny humanity that runs through it all.Mia Farrow gives what is arguably the strongest performance of her career -- she certainly stretches way beyond her usual image-- to play a tough, gum chewing mafia gun mol. It's also interesting to see Woody play a bit more of a 'character' than usual. The film is full of lovely black and white images, though it's not as visually striking as the greatest of the Gordon Wills/Allen collaborations like 'Manhattan'.If you have any interest in Allen's work (and if you're a film fan it's hard not to), then it's well worth seeing - or re-seeing."
1,Broadway Danny Rose,"When I tried to play this DVD, I got an error message and it wouldn't play.I have seen this movie before and would like to have a good DVD."
5,EXCELLENT,"One of Mr. Allen's Greatest, right up there with Zelig, Love and Death, Radio Days, Take The Money and Run, etc. Brilliant!"
5,"Classic, brilliant Woody","A tribute to NYC, show biz, and Broadway characters who are fast-disappearing. Mia Farrow is cast against type and is super. Zany, lovely, and compassionate; Allen at his best."
3,"See, there was this..","Okay. So there were a bunch of guys (talented or not) sitting around a Broadway deli talking about.... Well, who else. In this very funny send up of the seamy side of the nickel and dime theatrical business Woody Allen outdoes himself in his desire to placate his clientele. His over the top mannerisms and continual use of the by now obligatory use of the word `darling' by talent agents takes away a little from his performance but watch it nevertheless. And Mia Farrow as a Jersey style Mafioso doll is just fine. Can true love ever come of such a pairing except in a Woody Allen movie? Well, just ask that bunch of guys sitting around that deli. See."
1,Received a defective DVD,The DVD that was sent was defective and stopped playing after 10 minutes. I wiped it clean several times but continued to have the same problem
5,Broadway Danny Rose,One of my favorite Woody Allen films - at his imaginative best. Full of wonderful Characters .Well crafted and packed with subtle humour.
2,Outdated,"I think this was printed in 1994. I bought it because of the good reviews, but I should have checked the dates of the reviews, I suppose. Most of the photos are in black and white and the projects are outdated. Also, I ordered it from a third party seller and it arrived smelling of cigarette smoke. Look for a newer book on the same subject."
5,SO much information for beginners,"If you are like me, and have a sewing machine that you were given and have always wanted to try, but were afraid to, this book will really help you get up your courage and want to try it. I agree that the styles they suggest are outdated, but the techniques are so numerous and the directions so thorough that for the timid beginner like me, this is a great book to start with. It's almost a ""Sewing for Dummies"" but with a much more positive, upbeat attitude.Also included in the book is a section on tools, and notions, which again, for a beginner is SO helpful. It tells you which ones are worthwhile and you should consider buying and which ones are less so.And to top it all off there's a coupon in the back to send for a free pattern (of your choice!) to help you get started. For the price, I think it's fantastic."
5,Very nice,This is all instrumental music which is soothing and real hard to get tired of.Listend to it on the way across country.
2,Good as far as it goes...,"This book was widely anticipated and loaded with high expectations among the 124 (E-class chassis) community. I pre-ordered a copy months in advance. Why? The factory shop manual on CD is very difficult to use. A Haynes manual is only published in Europe, and covers only European models. This means there is effectively no aftermarket shop manual for these cars, where many other MB models have one available. I think we were all expecting a ""Bentley Grade"" shop manual (and all that this entails), like the stellar ones produced for BMWs and Audis. What we got was essentially an enhanced owner's manual, or a buyer's guide.If you just bought a 124, this book makes for a good orientation.If you are considering buying a 124, this is an excellent buyer's guide.If you want to actually fix something yourself, forget it!The Haynes manual from the UK is still the best bet for an aftermarket workshop manual. (ISBN: 1859602533)Anything really serious requires the factory CDs."
2,E-Class Owner's Bible - Disappointing,"Maybe I was expecting too much.This IS NOT a repair manual. It covers very basic, mundane areas like oil change. The coolant change procedure is incomplete and many maint. areas were not covered at all. The guide on buying one of these cars is nothing more than common sense.If you're looking for repair info, buy the MB CD-Rom and join one of the MB web lists."
2,Not a repair manual,"Read the other reviews...as a repair manual, this book is practically worthless.After relying on Bentley's BMW 5 series guide for 3 years, I was shocked. This is a coffee table book. Bathroom reading. What the owner's manual would look like if the glovebox were bigger.If you want to know how to remove the shift knob, how to get the sparkplug wires in the holder, or how much to torque the distributor cap, look elsewhere.It does have a chart describing all the available paint colors, though."
3,"Great Before you Buy purchase, pretty good after","I bought this book because the owner's manual in my '95 E320 had gone missing with the previous owner, and I wanted to know what all the buttons did. This book will not tell you. It's even a little coy and taunty about it - it gives you hints. But, it is NOT a replacement for the owner's manual. About a third of the book is reasonably useless once you've purchased a used Benz, unless you just enjoy reading about the history of your car. Which I did. And it won't really help you if something seriously goes wrong. But, it's a nice middle of the road book, especially if you still have the owner's manual, and you don't intend on replacing the radiator, but want to know that, around 125,000 miles, someone probably should."
1,Who needs a book like this?,"If you consider fixing your car yourself, this book is not going to help you. Well, I should have known... it covers the 6-cylinder, 8-cylinder and the diesel engine, which means that the book would have to be at least 3 times as thick to be any good. So if you are curious to know how things work in your car, but plan on having your repairs done at a shop, this book is great. But then, why would you even bother reading about it? I still wonder who could get any use out of this book... Any ideas?"
4,Good Manual. Not the be all end all,"I'd recommend this manual for a shade tree mechanic (home DIYer). If you need to save a few dollars on Maintence cost this is a good manual to have.It covers the standard stuff (Routine Maintenance, Brakes, Filter changes (Oil, Transmission, Air, Fuel). Has lots of pictures which are nice. The manual is broken down 12 Sections, Intro, Buying, Maintenance, 6-Cyl Engines, V-8 Engines, Diesel Engines, Fuel Injection, Transmissions, Suspensions Brakes Steering, Body, Electrical, and Performance and Mods.It not a shop manual, but it's a lot more than the owners manual that you'd find in the glove box.Overall I'm not disappointed but wouldn't solely depend on this manual."
3,Tracklisting,"Tracklisting01 Ladytron - Seventeen (Soulwax Remix)02 Gunjah - Funkwelt03 Monosurround - Take Me, Love Me, Hate Me04 Hands Gruber - Dogtime05 Lady B - Swany (Vitalic Remix)06 Caligola - Dreaming Being Drunk07 Chicken Lips - He Not In08 Junghanß - Waz Born09 M Mayer - Sneaker10 Teletronik - Disko's Dead11 Northern Lite - Reach The Sun (Extended Version)12 Clemens Neufeld - Don't Think, Feel!13 Generation Aldi - Infinity14 Kiki - Luv Sikk15 Codec & Flexor - Time Has Changed16 Warren Suicide - Warren Suicide (Enyak Remix)"
4,Expansive and profound,"Where else can you find a book that is simultaneously a cross-cultural survey on the myth and philosophy of the afterlife and a strange adventure tale about a man's gradual introduction to the strange customs of the other side? Well written, philosophically rigorous, and very entertaining, this book will definitely influence your world view if you approach it with an open spirit.My only qualms were that Leland sometimes hedges his bets too much in making his arguments appeal to scientifically-minded people who probably won't be interested in the book to begin with, and that the important concept of the ""cosmic normative balance"" isn't explained in enough depth when it is first introduced."
2,Not a learn on the go program,"I finished the Pimsileur Spanish II, and got this course for further study rather than Pimsileur Spanish III . I had hoped that this course would be like the Pimsileur course, namely that I could just listen to it in the car on the way to work. However, I found out that the tapes really need to be used with the book. Many of the recordings seem to be old, and sometimes are difficult to hear with the background noise in my car (Pimsileur was much easier). While the information was certainly complete, this course required much more effort to learn than the Pimsileur, and was not nearly so fun. I do think it helped me learn more Spanish, which was the ultimate goal."
5,Excellent for Fluency but I wouldnt recommend for a beginner,"I bought the cassette version and found it to be the best investment in Spanish that I've made. As stated in some of the other reviews, there isn't a lot of English spoken (one of the features I was looking for). I've had 4 years of Spanish prior to this (but it's been about 7 years since my last class). I bought the tapes for a trip to Spain and found them to be incredibly helpful. If you do have a grasp of the spanish language, I would recommend about a year (just the fundimentals of verb tenses), I think that you'll find these tapes the best on the market (yes better than Pimsluer). If you don't have a grasp and are looking for a basic tourist phrases etc, I would recommend ultimate spanish basic intermediate or Pimsleur 1. Some other great additions to this set are 501 Spanish verbs."
4,den of dorff,"i thought this was a really good movie.VERY well acted...especially by Dorff. This is Dorff's kind of role.He shows the good,the bad,and the kind-hearted,caring,sexy self that is ALL DORFF !! I LOVE this guy !!!!"
5,OH MY GOODNESS! A MUST SEE,"Suspense, Love, Envy, Murder, - keeps you wondering! This movie does have drug scenes. A murder, but not a graphic gory one. Christian families would not want their young children seeing this movie. It does have a very dark side to it. If you like Bleak House, you'll like this one. Much shorter though. My family has watched this movie several times since we purchased it. Very interesting and intriguing story line. Definitely wanted to see the ending, and did not expect the ending! I don't know how this compares to the book, we have never read it. But it is one of our favorite movies. We have lots of friends that like movies from this time period, and they have all watched this one and love it."
2,"""I never cared about the money.""","That line from this production given to John Jasper near the end of the film sums up just how dreadful this ""completion"" of the unfinished Dickens novel is. Ridiculous soap opera conclusion tacked on to the story ruins an otherwise excellent production. I loved the acting, the visuals, and the first half of the film. The final thirty minutes or so make it all a bad joke, and I felt like a fool watching it until I turned it off five or ten minute before it ended. I was in Rochester last year and watched them film some of the scenes done in the cathedral graveyard which is immediately adjacent to the cathedral, so was hoping that I would enjoy the film. It's better to watch the film without the contrived ending, just as Dickens left his story - unfinished. Sorry. Just plain old bad writing ruins what might have been a good Dickens adaptation."
2,Rather plain,"This book was just okay. The illustrations were very drab and not very exciting due to the poor color choices. The story itself was very simple, and frankly, not something my children could relate to. The boys that age I know wouldn't even go near a Ballet School Building, much less participate."
5,Best Universal Remote Control Ever,"Best Universal Remote Control Ever, very easy to use. We eliminated 6 remote controls with this unit. The help function with ""yes"" or ""no"" questions makes the unit very usable at any age level. Great unit."
3,Just OK-,"Spend the extra buck- this remote works with everything, however, the buttons are too small. The buttons have started to wear off after the first 6 months. Most numbers are completely gone and the weird thing is that I never use the number pad. NEVER - EVER! Why are they rubbing off? I wish I would have went with another remote model from Harmony!"
4,A universal remote that will last you years,"My Dad got the 688 for Christmas and I had the pleasure of setting the unit up for him using his mac Powerbook. The setup was a breeze and it was amazingly easy to find each and every piece of equipment he had stacked in his A/V cabinet on the Logitech website. This is a huge improvement over having to search through a list of manufacturer's codes that may or may not work. This worked the first time.On top of virtually guaranteeing compatibility with everything you've got in your system now, the macros that can be set up (e.g. Watch TV) save you the hassle of having to flip switches and press various buttons to get your system turned on.The only thing I was disappointed in was that the only buttons that were not easy to read - and did not show up with the backlight - were the macro buttons! This was very surprising. If they change this on the next revision, this remote will be hard to beat."
2,"Poor/confusing UI client application, remote not reliable.","This is one of the worst electronics products I have ever bought. The remote is not reliable, it doesn't store its state correctly (I switch off my PVR in the evening, and in the morning it only switches on TV, I have to switch on PVR and Audio manually). The remote also does NOT support two tuner DVR/PVR like DishDVR 522.The software client is web application which has very poorly designed UI with even worse Help system. The application is also unreliable, sometimes it fails to update changes (download) on your remote.It is still useble product, but just barely. Prepare to do a lot of experimenting and bring a lot of patience."
3,only one design flaw found so far,"The remote itself cannot be turned off. It's alwayson, displaying the Harmony logo. As a result, itgoes through one set of 4 AAA batteries a week. Planon getting rechargeable batteries."
4,Easy To Use Once Setup - Allows For Personalization,"Remote works just as the manufacturer says but takes longer to setup than they say - even for someone who is tech savy, but once setup, very easy to use. Not hard to setup, but to do it right and really personalize will take you a few hours. Love the fact it controls anything with an IR port including AC and Lights! Worth the price and thanks to this remote, I just went from 6 controlers to 1."
2,Not so Harmonious,"For one, JUST like it says, just the remote and nothing else, no manual, instructions, cd or anything to help with setup, all must be searched for online. These must be factory rejects or seconds, it costantly shourts out, blinks and blanks out, then has to be reset and re programmed. EATS batteries like m and m's. In essence , I threw away over $50."
4,Logitech Harmonty H-688,"Summary: Great features, tiny buttons, wish the screen was widerDetails: Using Logitech's online configuration tools, you can easily program the remote for pretty much any device (I couldn't find a remote that I could program for my new Vizio TV and this device works just fine).If I were to improve on this device, I would:1. enlarge the buttons, my wife stopped using the remote after a day because she kept hitting two buttons at the same time2. make the screen wider, so the text describing the functions fits in there. on a lot of functions, the text appears to be the same; for example, ""input S-Video 1"" and ""input S-Video 2"" just show up as ""input S-Video"""
4,"Good unit, Good buy!","OK, the buttons are small. Other than that, I really like this unit. It was easy to program for me, but might be a challenge for a person that is not too strong with PC knowledge. All my components were on the web site and the setup questions were very simple to follow. I've read that battery life is an issue, but I've had mine for more than a month and still on original batterys with no end in sight. My wife can now operate our HDTV surround sound system with one remote instead of me operating it for her using 4 remotes."
3,Media.,The button media allows you to see what is currently showing and you select the TV show you want to watch. You must update regularly to keep the feature current.
5,Universally Zen!,"With the Logitech Harmony 688, I've achieved remote nirvana! Finally, a universal remote control that really works.In the past, despite having only Sony equipment, I was plagued by 2 or 3 remotes on the couch at a time. Other remotes simply didn't cover all the functionality of the original remote to be a real alternative.The Harmony enables one to program each button with your favorite function. At the same time it offers standard constellations which elminate most of the setup work. So although it's not all plug & play, you should be 'one' with the 688 within a week of occasional fine tuning. In addition, this remote looks & feels good in your hand."
1,disappointed,This remote has extremely small buttons that lack any tactile response. The IR transmitter is much weaker than the remote that came with each component. This leads to partial reception of multi-component commands that leaves the remote in an incoherent state where it thinks the componets received all commands. I returned this product after 1 week.
4,Poinciana,"Mr. Jamal's return to his classic 1985 ""Poinciana"" via a digital remake is well done, although much shorter (8:25) than the 1993 version (11:28) on the ""Freeflight"" produced by Dave Grusin and Larry Rosen. Either version is truly enjoyable."
2,cheap,This board is cheaply made. The white board cannot be erased cleanly. It still has remnants of the first words I wrote on it though I used a cleaner and eraser.
1,An Awful Book...Just unbelievably bad,"Disciples of Fortune by Janvier Tisi may rank as one of the worst books I've ever read (or struggled to read).I was stupid enough to believe the reviews. I can't tell you how poorly written, repetitive, incoherent this work is. [...]"
3,Surprising,"Don't get me wrong about this book. I love the story. I gave it three stars because of the incredibly boring excess of parts that went to the past and to details about the cultures and traditions of the African people. The rest of the story is an amazing portrayal of the world of the hero who chose to return to his African roots and his mulatto son who is caught between the worlds of his parents that he can not fully identify with. It was a bit difficult for me to get used to the African names in the beginning, but that ceased to be a problem in the middle of the story. I like the hospitable nature of the African people and their sense of solidarity, loyalty and honor. I also sympathize with their plight especially as career criminals were allowed to take control and caused the loss of so many lives and livelihoods."
5,perfect,"good slim fit, good color, long - don't really have more to say except that my son really liked the way they fit. He is tall and thin and these were the next step after having the pull strip inside."
5,Thin Kin,My 13 year old brother is tall and thin. Nothing fits him right....until now.....he loves these jeans. He was so excited when he received them for Christmas as one of his gifts. What kid likes receiving clothes?!
5,Can't go wrong with these jeans.,These jeans are perfect for my son who is very slender. The 16 slim fits great and they look great. They fit like you would expect a pair of straight leg jeans to fit. The Hype color is like a good old fashion denim color. The delivery was really quick too.
3,Levi's Jean,As we all know Levi's Jeans are great products and this is the only jeans brand my 14 yr old always buys until recently. Nice !!!!
5,Levis arrived as promised :),The jeans arrived as promised in the condition we expected. This was a textbook-perfect transaction. Thank you!
1,Cheap,I love Levis. But these are the cheapest looking pair of pants I have ever seen or felt.I would not recommend these to anyone.
5,Loved reading three of McMurtry's novels at one whack-,"Larry McMurtry has an easy-going, though smart, style, that I identify with deeply. He doesn't try to pummel you with big words and confusing sentences. He writes like it feels."
2,Very Expensive !!,I think it is Very Expensive !!I can get it at local Indian or Chinese store for $20 in California.
4,Serpico: A Name That Became Famous,"This is a fairly long film but, like Al Pacino, it's rarely boring. The name of Pacino's character, ""Serpico,"" has become synonymous with ""honest cop."" It demonstrates what a strong impact this movie had on millions of people.There have so many crooked-cops-themed films in the past 30 years that this film has lost a lot of its shock-and-awe. The long hair, wild clothes, beads, etc. really date this film, too, it being so early '70s in looks. It's almost become a ""period piece"" as if it were the Roaring Twenties except its the Hairy and sleazy Seventies.What hasn't changed over the years is Pacino's acting, of course. There have been very few films in which he starred that didn't display his talents to the fullest. This film, along with Dog Day Afternoon and few others, put him ""on the map,"" making him a big star. He's been a ""star"" ever since.Gritty? Yes. Profane? Yes; Memorable? Most definitely. When you speak of modern-day film classics, ""Serpico"" is one of them."
4,Nostalgia for the Good Guys,"I came of age with this movie. Learned to trust myself being the only good guy (even ""saint"") among the many bad guys. Pacino may be remembered by many as the cool-head, cold-blooded gangster of Godfather series, but as Serpico he remains my hero as the uncompromising, opera-loving, ballet-dancing, intellectual (also womanizer) who ""fixed"" the corrupt system."
5,One of my favorite Pacino flicks.,This movie was raw and gritty and was based on a true story. What else can i say.Watched it twice.
4,politically correct?,"i have seen this movie so many times i know it intimately it is pacino at his very best but there is a scene where he is handed money from another cop from a man named jewish max,BUT,they have voiced over the dialogue and changed it to JOYCE MAX,why!! will jewish people be offended? this is the name also given in the book,so why? i have seen an ugly trend in hollwood to erase anything not politically correct. remeber spielbergs new changes to E.T.? RADIOS FOR GUNS!!hollywood and their ilk must think mighty low of us unwashed heathen thinking we cant handle it!!!as if there were anything to handle! 4 STARS FOR THIS ACTION,"
4,A Good Time Capsule,"of the look and attitudes of 1973. I consider Al Pacino's performance here more oscar worthy than ""Godfather II"" but slightly less than ""Scarface."" The pressure veteran NYC cops and officials put on rookie cops to take bribes or face gunfights alone is indeed one of the sorrier chapters of American history."
4,This Movie is Like a Classic Rotary Phone,"I have read the book and watched the movie in past and it is a classic and worth a new purchase. The lone good cop in a sea of corruption. The best part is that this is a true story. I had a lone good cop in my life once, so it's a role that I sympathize with.Watching the cops dial on rotary phones was great! Sometimes I wish that they still had such limitations. Technology sometimes is not all that it's cracked up to be."
3,Slowed down because it is biographical,"Serpico is a movie that is worth seeing for Al Pacino fans. He puts on a great performance. However, the movie struggles to hold my attention during its 130 minute run time. It is very slowly paced with many long shots. This movie strives to stay true to its biographical source, which means there are dozens of characters and events that unfold that don't seem to flow together. Most movies would have combined characters and cut down details to make it flow, but this did not. I'm glad I saw it and I would recommend it to Pacino fans."
5,Police corruption has it's day in court,"Although 33 years have lapsed since this film was made, one has no trouble fitting right in and indentifying with this time frame...The acting and movie pace are perfect,,,this could be Al Pucino's ""best"" film, even better than Godfather III...The sound score by Mikis Theodorakis was absolutely the best & well suited to this film....This DVD arrived fast & in excellent condition,,,very satisfied & will deal with seller again >"
5,Not all Cops are Bad After All . . .,Looks like there is hope in America in the justice system. The one good copper in New York faces all the injustice of his co-workers. Well acted by MR. PACINO.
1,Al Pacino home town,it's the city as it was. before there was a Starbucks on every corner. with Al Pacino early in his career giving a performance all he's got. I had forgotten about this movie but I saw a news item with the real Serpico in it then I went to Amazon to order. the story shows how bad corruption can get and how we should be glad for people like Serpico who had the guts to speak out.
2,dated,"I bought this dvd based on the reviews I read, well let me tell ya, this movie is very dated. The direction is very poor. Time in this movie moves very fast, the only way you can tell that a year has passed is by the length of Pacino's beard or the growth of his dog. The story is boringly (is that a word?) told. It would make a great re-make done by a better director. Maybe in the 70's this was cutting edge, but I found it as interesting as an episode of Matlock. Now with that said, Al Pacino is the bright spot in this black hole of a movie, his acting is the only reason I could stay awake. So if your an Al Pacino fan....and you have to own all of his movies then and only then get it, but if you just want to watch it once to see a great preformance by Al, RENT IT."
5,Nobody touches Pacino,"A man with such an ethnic look that he can play a Jew, Italian, Cuban, Puerto Rican ------ what's next?"
3,The book with the same title is more exciting and gripping,The book with the same title is more exciting and gripping. This movie is not a showcase of Al Pacino's great acting either.This film is worth renting not buying.
4,A classic always,"I've seen this movie many time over the years and always enjoy Al Pacino's 'honest cop in a crooked police force' portrayal. In many ways, better than newer movies having the same plot."
5,"I've had a crush on Al since ""Panic in Needle Park"" his very","first movie. He was a stand out in that movie, I thought to myself, he's going to be a big star. He also has the nicest head of Italian hair I've ever seen. I don't think he's ever made a stinker of a movie. He always puts everything into his acting and it shows every time. Serpico is no exception. Griping and taut I enjoyed every minuite of it. If you've never seen it please do. You won't regret it."
5,Superb Soul Album,The Dock of the Bay is a phenomenal soul album and a must for soul fans. A great addition to any record collection.
3,Poor Description,"The camera has a good picture, but it is sold as a weather proof camera and it says right on the camera in door use only.I will still be mounting it outside but under an overhang."
1,Junk camera,"The picture quality is so poor (almost no colors!); you'd be surprised how big it is and how difficult it is to hide (""Ultra slim bullet"" is a misleading description); this thing is a 3 inch long pipe. Secondly, the screw that is necessary to fix the camera into position on the base got jammed and is useless now (low quality screw)- must use duck tape. If this thing costs $5 I'd recommend it, otherwise save the money."
2,Bad Deal...,"This camera is absolutely horrible. Picture quality is totally subpar. The audio is useful, and is the only reason why this camera got 2 stars. Detail is pretty much nonexistent in the video feed from this camera. Once someone walks more than 5 feet from the camera, they instantly become totally unrecognizable."
3,Okay value,"I have to rate this camera as an okay value. The good news is its easy to set up and use, and worked as advertised out of the box. The bad news: the picture washes out in direct sunlight and the colors also tend to wash out badly unless the lighting is just right. I also wish the cord was a lot longer, especially for the wall plug. That said I'm not unhappy with this purchase, it does what it is supposed to do at a good price once you get it all set-up and adjusted. For comparison I would say the picture is not as good as my hi-8 video camera, but still pretty good once adjusted, although pretty awful if in less than ideal conditions. Also doesn't work at all at night. Picture would make a pretty good daylight security camera. The mic works but tends to crack if sounds are too loud etc. overall an okay value for the money."
2,No good for DVR Systems,"When hooked directly to a TV, this bullet camera is fine. If you are planning on using this camera with a security DVR system, spend the extra for a CCD camera. When viewed through my security DVR, the picture is B/W, and has lots of horizontal lines running through it. A regular camcorder connected to the exact same input (which uses CCD light capturing) has a flawless picture.I would suspect most people to use these bullet cameras with a DVR security system these days. Not sure why they would be incompatible like this.Returned an will get a CCD camera."
5,Classic Thrash Death at its best,"this is one of the most brutal and heaviest CD that I can think of. Rob Barret(formerly of Cannibal Corpse, now Malevolent Creation), Alex Marquez (Formerly of Demolition Hammer, and Malevolent Creation) lead this onslought of one of the best death metal CD's to come out of the early 90's. Transmorgrified is one of the best songs on this album, and one of the best death metal songs period. Buy this now!"
3,Old time fun,"This game is for old time fun. Most of the graphics are old and very small. Although it is fun to go back and play these games, the high scores don't get saved, so you have to start over every time."
3,OK,"This is an OK game. The games it has on it are Pac-Man, Pac-Man Arrangment, Ms.Pac-Man, Galaga, Galaga Arrangment, Galaxian, Pole Position, and Pole Position 2. The Graphics aren't very good because they're old games. The sound is fine. If you're looking for a serious game don't get this. Some games are hard, and some are easy. If you are a fan of the Atari I highly recomend this game. If you get enough points on Pac-Man You can on unlock Pac-Attack, and Pac-Mania. This an ok game."
3,"Great Games, Weak Package","The games are as great as ever, but Namco is being really cheap. Only 6 games, and 2 of them are just near-identicle sequels - this is a $... DVD-ROM, there should have been more, such as Xevious, Mappy or Rally X."
3,Classic but nothing to jump over,It's good to see some classic games on the PS2. The game has one super flaw and that is no auto save and load so you must constantly save and reload your data while playing (this is seriously annoying). You'll play this game with nostagla the first day or so but after that it'll be on the shelf collecting dust as you remind yourself you brought a PS2 for ground breaking new games not pac-man.
2,Used for three days,"It was cheap, so the saying ""you get what you pay for"" is definitely true here. I gave it a two because it was inexpensive and it did fit my phone. But I scratched my phone taking it off.My phone looked awful with the cover on. And it IS a dust trap. Believe the other reviews that mention this. The cover is not pretty and may only protect it from a fall...maybe. I didn't want to mess with it long enough to find out.I learned a lesson. Glad it was a cheap one."
1,meekins,I did not read where it said that it don't fit krzr k1m so I am with three cases that don't fit and before they look to see if they have a replacement I have to send the other 3 cases back.
5,KRZR 1 CLEAR CASE,I bought this case to help protect the phone and it fit like a glove. i found it to be reasonably priced and delivery was quicker then expected.thanks Amazon.com for finding me exactly what i was looking for.
5,Outstanding!,"The Detroit show is so outstanding I didn't think anything would match up to it.So when I recieved this I didn't have many expectations. I love it! The Doors are starting to make me believe they were the best live band of the era. The ""Celebration of the Lizard"" here is the best I've heard and worth the price of the CD;s.""Light My Fire"" is also outstanding, it's golden. The Doors hit their groove an hour into this show. Once in the groove it's heartstopping in it's brillance.I loved the Doors from the June night in 1967 when I first heard the long version of ""Light My Fire"".I'm coming to believe from listening to these recordings that there are no groups out there now that can match the perfection of the Doors live when they hit their groove. I'm glad I have this and it will enhance my life for years to come."
5,Just like the real thing.,I saw the Doors live many times when Morrison was alive. This is the real deal. I'm amazed at the fidelity they can pull from the old tapes.
3,LOW BUDGET MOVIE IS ACTUALLY PRETTY GOOD,"Another low budget Charles Band production, this ranks as one of his more enjoyable offerings. An alien named Cosmo (NOT SEINFELD's Kramer)is posing as a radio DJ and captures women, shrinks them and puts them on display in glass jars. So it's up to the real DJ shock jock Dan O'Dare and TV reporter Lisa Cummings to stop them. Though Dan isn't easily persuaded to begin with (he humiliates Cummings live on air when she claims to have seen a UFO) both soon find themselves warning the other townsfolk of the imminent danger, but, as in all B movies they are arrested, ridiculed etc. It doesn't take a genius to figure what the outcome will be, but it is quite entertaining. A sequel of sorts followed DOLLMAN VS THE DEMONIC TOYS, which is itself a sequel to (naturally) DOLLMAN and DEMONIC TOYS. Keep your eyes peeled for heavy rock group Blue Oyster Cult and the wierdo band featuring some goon dressed as a cow."
2,"No guts, no glory","Yes, I am back to berate yet another B-rated monster flick that really sucked. You may notice the title of this is ""No guts, no glory, "" which is true. The reason is that there was almost no real killing, no gore, no nothing (including a plot). So, grab your remote and flip away from those Bad Channels and watch a better monster flick like Rawhead Rex or Dark Side of the Moon."
2,"I love bad films, but...","I watch movies like this for the sheer entertainment value of watching horrible, bad, ugly, stinking movies. They're usually quite funny, and if ya get bored you can play Mystery Science Theatre on the movie with your friends.Unfortunately, there are bad movies, then there are movies that are just plain *bad.* This one's just *bad.* You can tell it's horrible because of the little stars around the word *bad.* There's bad acting, no plot, and everything else that makes a good bad movie, but this one took itself seriously and really tried to be a good movie that would appeal to ""urban youth"" (the rock bands they feature every two minutes are so bad that hard-core '80s metal fans would look the other way in disgrace).

2,30 people usally on thier 50 severs ??? quite horrible ..lol,i bought this game hoping for a game with 40 plus players ....what i got was 13 people usally online in a given room playing coop mode against AI opponet...AI can see you in a thick bush and point thier guns at you even though you on the opposite side of a fence sneaking up? very lame over all ...feels like your playing a choppy mess when you move.... nothing like battlefield 2. this game needs to be bargin bin buy ...don't pay 40 for this not worth it....game coding is junk!
5,Something a little different,"If you are a Manhattan Transfer fan, this is a really fun CD. All the great MT harmonies in a retro doo wapp style. Very inventive and fresh. The CD is short by any standards but you will enjoy every tune especially the new sound of the classic Unchained Melody. Upbeat with excellent vocals and musicians."
4,"Excellent Overview, somewhat lacking in personalities.","This is an excellent broad scope look at the history of rocketry and how that led to spaceflight, along with the sometime practical and sometime cynical political decisions that led to spaceflight.My only real complaint was that there was an overwhelming number of names that were involved and Heppenheimer gives them all due mention, but I never got a sense for the real personalities of Korolev and von Braun or anyone else that really made things happen.Other than that minor flaw, I thought is was a greath history, and I came away with a new appreciation of spaceflight and the skill and expertise that it takes to make a satellite or rocket work."
2,No references given anywhere in the book.,"While I agree with the basic premise of the book, that corporations are exerting an obscene amount of control in world politics, I wouldn't reccomend reading this book. The author will cite a statistic, or a story, and will give no formal indication of where that quote comes from. The book is mostly just repetitive leftist polemics and rhetoric, and while I am pretty leftist myself, I try to avoid this kind of literature on either side of the fence.Books like this should contain documentation, look for a bibliography, look for footnotes when you buy such a book."
5,a salient contribution,"With contributions from Noam Chomsky, Ralph Nader, David Korten, Jeremy Rifkin and a host of other equally seminal thinkers, ""Corporations Are Gonna Get Your Mama"" reveals how the corporate economy is subverting democracy (or its remnants), polluting the environment and creating criminal chaos all under the guise of free-market ""freedom"".Far from being all doom and gloom, the salient contributors to ""Corporations Are Gonna Get Your Mama"" have outlined strategies to create democratic, egalitarian control of everyone's economic resources."
1,Will not honor warranty - non-exististent customer service,"Approximately 2 years ago I purchased an 11"" Cybernox frying pan (made by Sitram). The reviews, marketing literature and warranty appeared to support the purchase. My family has used the pan for HOME use-only - and, as it turns out, the pan is defective (the coating has come off between the base and the side). I contacted Sitram USA and was told that warranty would be provided ONLY if submitted with a copy of the 'receipt of purchase'. After 2-3 years, it is unreasonable to require a proof of purchase - since the pan, itself, should serve as proof of a defective product!Unless you are meticulous with all records - DO NOT PURCHASE A SITRAM product! Unless, of course, standing by the quality of a product means nothing to you."
2,I think the other reviews were written by Cybernox salesmen.,"My wife and I purchased this pan and it's smaller counterpart. Both of these pans have not lived up to what they're supposed to do, which is to provide a non-stick cooking surface. We have ended up buying Calphalon pans to replace the cybernox. Very disappointed."
1,Ouch Ouch Ouch !!!!,"OMG !!! I had ""red bumps"" and applied this stuff as directed. WOWSERS!!! My red bumps turned into Flaming Burning Bumps!!!! Hurt soooo much ! Into the trash !!!! Be careful if you try this stuff !!"
5,FINALLY...A PRODUCT THAT WORKS!!,"i'd struggled with razor bumps my entire adult life and after trying every conceivable remedy had given up my battle. but then a friend recommended ""bump down"" and within a week my skin was as smooth as strong as it's been since i was a kid. THANK YOU BUMP DOWN!!!"
4,It's a cream and not a plain astingent,"I bought this because it was a cream and as such conditions the shaved head or beard. Like all these bump chemical concoctions it helps to get rid of bumps caused by irritation and in some cases in grown hairs. I have had no in grown hairs and very few bumps.I use an Braun electric razor and a Headblade. I like the electric because it is less irritating and the Braun gives a very close shave. I use the curved Headblade razor as well but sparingly and at times just a Gillette triple head razor because the electric does so well.One caveat. All of these products have a strage smell to them so I would use something, cologne or whatever if you are going out or just don't care for it's odor. I can tell you they all have the same smell to a certain degree and that's the only reason I gave it four instead of five stars."
5,The Cream That You Use B4 Proactive,This is the best product! If this don't work then use proactive. This product is best used with Clearasil for Sensitive Skin. Apply the Clearasil 1st then the Barc all over your face to prevent the bumps from spreading.(not junst in the affected area) Allow apx. 2 weeks to start seeing noticible results.
4,Consistent use required!,"Does exactly what it says on the bottle, calms down the bumps, until they pretty much disappear. Even after I realized I was shaving the wrong way and started shaving the right way, I still couldn't get rid of some of the bumps, but they've gone down significantly since using this. It still takes time. Nothing is over night."
4,Better Than Styx?? Really? No I mean REALLY?????,"I am a die-hard Styx fan and love there present linup as well as the original. The folks who are slobbering all over themselves as this is like the Return of Styx is a bit wierd. This is IMHO his best solo effort to date and does sould more like the Styx of old then other efforts, but folks its just a very good collection from a very talented entertainer. I gave it 4 Stars because thats what I thought it deserved, its not epic masterpiece status (go get Captain Beyond's first effort if you need an example of a masterpieceCaptain Beyond) Enjoy this because it IS good music but you seldom get to recover the past greatness of musical talents."
4,Very Styx Like CD,"Dennis delivers a fantastic CD, strongest of his solo career. I believe it has a very Styx like sound - why? - beyond the obvious reasons, I hear a background singer on most of the tracks which sounds exactly like JY's high pitched wail. If you liked any of the classic Styx CDs, you'll like this one."
5,"Not Styx, Not Broadway - Just Music, REALLY GOOD Music!","Please let's stop the Styx vs. DDY debate. Hell, they stopped it years ago. Cyclorama was an outstanding (sans DDY) Styx CD -- and this is an outstanding DDY (sans Styx) CD!!!This is the best DDY offering, I think -- ever. I've always loved the songs from DDY that you couldn't quite classify (Nothing Ever Goes As Planned being one of my favorite examples): is it rock? pop? funk? bombastic? This ENTIRE album is like that.It does make me wonder how it would sound with Styx behind him, but I'm not sure he writes this CD if he's still in Styx.Dennis, rock on! You keep giving us CD's THIS good, I'll keep paying $30.00 for the IMPORT and not wait 9 months for Best Buy to stock it for $9.99 in the U.S. :)"
4,Solid DDY effort,"I always thought Dennis had the songs and the voice that made Styx who they are, but his solo albums were always weak (as compared to Tommy who's solo albums were always amazingly strong).This CD shows a very good showing for Dennis. There is no smash hit here, the song you hear for the first time and go WOW, but there isnt any real lame somngs here either, what you get is a good smooth album, not great but no crappy...decent is the word."
4,Surprising Good,"I rate this album 4-stars. This is a very good album. It is way better (and sounds alot more like Styx) than Cyclorama or A Brave New World. It is probably the best thing from any of the Styx guys in a long, long time. It isn't perfect, but it has some very good songs and Dennis Deyoung's voice is still exceptional.The packaging sucks. The cardboard ""green"" crap. Please give me my jewel cases back! At least it doesn't just have a sleeve for the album like some new albums."
3,One Hundred Years From Now,"I ordered this as a lark, but I was very pleased with this CD. It is reminiscent of the classic Styx style. The orchestration is extremely together."
4,A really good album,"Dennis' voice sounds great. His greatest weakness is a tendency to go overboard with the ballads. There are some slower songs here, but no ""Babe."" Many of the songs are uptempo and his bands sounds very good. Well worth the money."
5,Great book focused on attack techniques and plugging holes,"Normally I do not write reviews, but I felt after reading this book readers need to know how good it is. I work with NT and 2000 on a daily basis, so at first I thought this book would be focused on registry settings, etc. To my initial surprise, it wasn't. After rereading the title I realized Held was focused on the TCP/IP protocol suite and securing Windows devices from attack.Reading this book gave me a significant insight into attack methods and how to either stop them or negate their effect. For example, this book is the first to expose the script-form attack which can cost organizations a bundle of money. By reading this book I learned how to verify key firewall and router settings as well as make certain changes to our web servers that will alleviate potential security risks. The practical information provided tells me the author knows his stuff. Overall this book is a five star plus."
2,Get what you pay for,"It's interesting to see how he goes through the process of developing a logo, but it's not news. If you want to walk through the process with him, it's a decent primer, but if you already develop logos or logotypes, this isn't new info or comprehensive enough to give you more fodder to process.But...if you've never developed a logo, this is a bit of good info on how the process works."
4,"Very nice, colorfully and tastefully executed Madrigal singing","Very nice, colorfully and tastefully executed Madrigal singing. Imaginatively orchestrated, chosen and executed Madrigal singing.My only critique is that some of the collection increasingly drifts a little towards less interesting pallet of long, drawn out offerings from time to time.Between three and four star rating.Ken Cybulska"
1,Incorrect Watch Displayed In Photo,"The watch that was shipped was a completely different model! The photo shows a fully digital watch, however the actual G7100D-1VDR that was sent is a dual analog and digital watch. The watch is okay but totally different in appearance and features from the model shown. Completely disappointed!"
2,mm...,"ok this is tricky. the package arrived in one piece, and in good time.but the clasp doesn't fit/lock. and sadly i was visiting the us, so couldn't return it. hopefully i can get it fixed, without too much hassle, because it is a cool watch!"
2,Not like the dog!,"Ok, If you own the Barbie w/ the dog that poops and feel compelled to buy the cat that pees DON'T! It's a total pain in the butt! First off your using water, the cat does'nt drink it very well so theres water everywhere, then you got sand in the little box everywhere! If you like cleaning up after Barbie and kitty go for it! Not for me, my daughter wasn't that thrilled with it either."
4,"My daughter loves it, but the sand is messy","My daughter loved this item and had fun with the litter box for a few playtimes, but the bright colored sand ended up all over in my carpet and she lost the tiny pieces pretty quickly. She still has the cat and the Barbie though."
5,children's music,I am happy to let you know we are revamping our website and all our testimonials will be there.. visit us
4,"Sweet, mellow western swing set","I don't know anything about the movie this soundtrack is from, but the music sure is sweet! An album full of music from one of the finest western swing/stringband revival bands, the now-defunct Hot Club Of Cowtown, with five new tracks from HCCT co-founder Whit Smith's new group. It's fine stuff from start to finish, a very listenable, very pleasant set, roaming through various acoustic jazz, blues and country styles, with a healthy dose of classic western swing tunes. This is a well-programmed album, and a fine testament to the Hot Club's freewheeling, joyful style. Recommended!"
4,Burke - tougher than ever,"In this gritty and most suspenseful thriller, Burke is back and more focused than ever. If you like books that take you to the edge, with characters bent on revenge and justice, than this book is certianly for you. I have been a Burke fanatic since Strega came out, and this one is certainly worth the ride. Andrew Vachss has done it again - harder and better than ever."
5,"Had this on hardback when it was first released, I just needed it for my Kindle.","Excellent, Andrew Vachss never lets me down! Read and re-read all of his books. Than take yourself to the protect website and donate to the best children's advocates on the planet!"
4,"Another great ""Burke"" novel!","Vachss' great anti-hero Burke returns in this latest adventure. While the book may cause some confusion for readers who haven't read all the Burke novels, for die-hard fans there are plenty of ""inside"" references to Burke's earlier escapades. As always Vachss provides a gritty, hard-nosed and unflinching look at the evil that men create, and allows Burke to use his less than legal approach to try and set things right. A worthy installment in the continuing saga of Burke. Enjoy!"
3,"Not bad, but same ol same ol.","This is who knows what number in the Burke series. Although each book is a self-contained mystery, you're really best reading the earlier books first to get a handle on the characters and the flashbacks that occur.But by this book, things seem a little tedious. Burke spends too much time brooding, and thinking. Yeah we get, bad stuff happened to you, bad stuff happens to other people. You're tortured, you want to hurt others. We get it. Move on already.The action is pretty slow in this book too, after the inital chapter book spends about a third of the book just 'laying low' and another third slowly tracking down those who hurt him. (read: a lot of waiting, and following. yawn)Still the character of Burke and his relentless pursuit of those who hurt and prey on children is admirable, even if his methods are usually not. (Although you have to wonder if those people get what they deserve.)"
4,Darkland on film,"If you ever wanted to see a film version of the classic computer game Darkland, this is the movie for you. Very good photography."
3,Only applies to public school students,"Helping Your Gifted Child Soar IN PUBLIC SCHOOL would be a more appropriate title. Anyone interested in giftedness as a life issue, in strategies for enhancing it as a life issue apart from school, or in dealing with giftedness as it applies to learning generally, regardless of setting, will be disappointed. Those who do, however, have questions principally about helping their children in the public school system will find it quite satisfying. This homeschool mom wanted something else."
3,Not helpful unless your school has a gifted program,"I was looking for something that would help guide me through the perils of having a gifted child. This book talks a lot about identification and characteristics of a gifted child, but doesn't tell you how to work with these children - at home or at school. When it talks about teaching, it assumes that your local public school has a gifted and talented program."
5,Someone Knows How We Feel!,"This book is not only a great guide for parents, (my mother loved it too!) but gives great insight to those of us who grew up not understanding why people just didn't think in the same way as did we.The authors focus on the intellectual AND the emotional needs of the ""gifted"" child and give solid advice as to what those who are involved in the child's development can do to help the child develop to full potential.This is a must read work for anyone who is concerned with the emotional well-being of an exceptionally talented child.This is a must read work for anyone who is concerned with the emotional well-being of an exceptionally talented child."
2,More of the same.,I didn't feel the book broke any new ground on the subject. If you haven't read any other books on the subject this will do. Otherwise I wouldn't recommend it.
3,not meaty enough for me,"I appreciate the effort, but I was disappointed in this book. It offers little practical advice and doesn't even scratch the surface when it comes to kids who are highly to profoundly gifted. I'd recommend it as a good overview for a new parent who is unfamiliar with all things gifted."
3,The Wonderful World of O.D.,"David Brizer's book on the introduction to Pyschiatry is an interesting perspective which attempts to show Freud running about a psuedo-land of Oz. From the ancient days of boring a hole in ones head to let out the demons to the current trend of shoving pills down ones throat. The author definately condones the use of medication over therapeutic style treatment, where medication is used in moderation and speculation. Basically this is a crash course in the history and practice of psychiatry, which for such a complex subject, you may think the author would take it at a slower pace. Yet, as an introduction, one is expected to move to another book with more detail and moderation. Reccomended for the curious and those thinking about the field of psychiatry. Also, at this point the book is somewhat dated, in which it needs to be up-dated."
1,WARNING! Playtex Bottles Contain BPA Bisphenol-A.,"Playtex Ventaire Bottles are NOT Bisphenol-A Free. The Playtex Bottles with the liners are considered ok! I was recently informed about the use of Bisphenol -A in some brands of Baby Bottles, After re-searching Bisphenol -A, I discovered that exposing my baby to harmful chemicals with the potential for long term affects later in life, was definitely not for me!! There are other options out there, all glass bottles are safe, as well as Born Free, Mam by Sassy, Green to Grow and Adrini. The Playtex Bottles with the liners are said to be ok, though the hard plastic shell of the bottle is made using Bisphenol-A, the plastic liner that touches the baby's milk is not! Do your own research. I'm really surprised that the non Bisphenol -A Free bottles haven't been recalled yet! I'm sure it's just a matter of time, before enough people are educated."
1,Helps with Gas but Must Mix Formula In Diff Bottle,These bottles help a bit with gas but my baby still gets gassy and burbs a lot. The major problem with them is that you have to mix the formula in a regular bottle because it will ooze out through those vent air holes. Then the formula is all bubbly so you have to let it sit for a bit and then you can finally feed the baby.The only advantage is that it helps you feed the baby in a more upright position because of how the bottle is titled.I highly recommend regular gerber bottles. They are much cheaper and way better!!! That is what my mom used with me and the formula flows out nicely.
1,you need a super sucker for these!,"My foster baby went through many kids of bottles as he was very anti-eating. I bought these thinking he wouldn't have to stop to let air in once he finally would get started. He got NOTHING! I even grabbed another bottle, filled it with water and tried. I couldn't get ANYTHING! I know someone who use them and she said you have to be careful because many of them don't work~ she had to keep taking them back and exchanging them until she got a few that did work. Well that is more than I care to do. One of my 6 worked properly and once I put it through the dishwasher it was no good. I threw them all in the trash because I didn't want any other baby to have to scream and cry out of frustration by being teased by a bottle."
2,Too many problems with these!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I was looking forward to these bottles and what a disappointment!!! First of all you can't use them in a bottle warmer so you have to warm up the formula by other means and then put formula back into bottle. Second of all they do leak!!!!!! I have followed instructions to the T- making sure all the parts are dry and making sure vent is in properly and without fail twice a day I am cleaning the top shelf to my fridge from formula running everywhere. Too many parts to worry about. A new mom just has enough to worry about without fighting with these constantly for one reason or another. I am returning two other packages of these I have and going back to the Gerber bottles I had when my daughter was little. The fact that the bottoms come off of these opens up the risk of a host of other problems. I would not recommend these bottles to anyone. I have ""worked"" with them for two weeks-I'm done!!!!!!!!"
5,Very happy customer,I had every intention of breast feeding but my daughter would have nothing to do with it so I tried the playtex nursers because those were suppose to be the best but she didn't like those and just cried so I went with the Airvents. She took to them without any problems whatsoever. And we couldn't be any happier. Yeah some of the nipples I've had to open up a little bit with a kitchen knife but that's nothing to get worked up about it's no big deal. And there may be more parts to wash but it makes it easier to get every little spot clean when the bottom comes off.
1,Don't spend money on these!,My baby was having trouble with gas and spitting up so I decided to try these bottles. The first time I tried feeding him he was screaming because he couldn't get anything out of the nipple. I even tried sucking on it myself and could barely get anything out of it. How is a little baby supposed to? I thought maybe the nipples were defective so I poked a bigger hole in the. Big mistake. The bottle didn't work at all and bubbled really bad. I tried to go to size 2 nipples to solve the problem and they flowed to fast. Also if you plan on filling a bottle and taking it somewhere they leak out of the bottom terribly. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THESE. After spending $25 on these bottles I only ended up having to buy Dr Browns. Which I love!
1,Terrible!,"I bought these bottles to use to supplement my baby's breastfeeding. I thought that the special design would be a help to gas problems associated with bottle-feeding. My child cried for hours when I tried to give her these bottles. At first I thought she was having difficulty transistioning over to bottle-feeding, but I discovered that the nipples would not release any milk to my baby. I tried to fix the nipple, but it still took her 2 hours to take one ounce of milk! Don't do this to your child...it is horrible to hear them scream for hours. I went back and purchased Avent bottles...she took them from the first moment."
1,Very Poor Design,"If you own these bottles please pay close attention to the little vent holes/slits in the bottom disc. I was just washing my bottles and was horrified to realize that there was a black mold like substance in the slits. I wash them better than they recommend, I hand wash and boil all the pieces. So why is there mold forming in the slits? I'm getting rid of all these germ infested bottles and going to buy a better designed bottle. Oh...they don't prevent air bubbles any better than any other brand. Just don't waste your money on them."
4,"Good product, but you can't put it in the bottle warmer","I love this bottle. My 6 month old has less gas with this bottle. It was easy to clean up because the bottle comes apart to make cleaning a snap. The only thing I did not like was that I could not put it in the bottle warmer because of the ventaire piece. I would warm it up in another bottle and pour into the the ventaire bottle. Overall, it is a good product and I would recommend it to first time moms."
1,Never Again!,"I bought these bottles because they were highly recommended by my sister who has 3 youngsters. My son did HORRIBLE ON THEM! He would be so gassy at times he would scream in pain for hours.-The ""vent"" DOES NOT let air into the bottle so the baby has to release the nipple to let air in so they can keep drinking.-you can not use electric bottle warmers-Assembly UGH!-Pricey!! DOUBLE UGH!!!!I gave EVERY vent air bottle to my sister, my son does GREAT on the disposable bottle liners, no gas, no fussing, HAPPY baby!"
2,Product can't be used in a bottle warmer!...,"I received these bottles for a shower gift and when I took them out of the box it says in the directions they can't be used in a bottle warmer. If you do warm them, by some other means, you have to take the nipple out to do so. I don't know about anyone else but the bottle warmer I feel is going to be a godsend and to have a bottle that I can't use in the warmer! I am returning these (...)bottles."
3,too small of a hole in nipple,"I really reviewed these bottles before buying them, and really did like them except for the nipples. I realized that most of the nipple had no opening at all and I had to poke through them with the tip of a fork, which made the flow bigger. My advice would be if you are going to use these, be sure to check the holes before feeding your baby."
4,"Great bottle, especially for sucking problems","My son was born six weeks early and had problems with eating. He was tongue tied and had weak suction. For these reasons, we had to bottle feed in order to watch his food intake (being a premie too, you really have to know exactly how much the baby is eating).These bottles took some getting used to; the bottom completely comes off and a rubber ""vent"" is placed into the base. You really need to make sure they are assembled correctly, or they will leak. After figuring that out, we had to switch to the faster flow nipple (the slow flow, is VERY slow). Once we worked out all the bugs, these bottles were great. They really do help with gas, as long as you follow the directions correctly (NO bubbles in the formula/ milk before feeding). Since our little guy has problems sucking, he tends to gulp, thus we need all the help with gas relief."
1,don't work!!,"These bottles add frustration to feeding any baby. They didn't let any milk out!! I tried everything and they would not work, I had to keep unscrewing the bottom to let in air so she could get milk out. I tried every bottle and ended up with avent, very easy to use."
1,Don't waste your money,I gave these bottles every possible chance with my son. They just don't work for him. The nipples either collapse (I have never heated them in the microwave) or he just can't get any milk out. Maybe I should try the stage 2 nipple but I'm just too disappointed at this point. I thought if I gave him a week to develop a stronger sucking reflex then he could use them better. I was wrong!!! And the extra time cleaning them is a hassle and what new mom needs that?
2,Good for a month,"Like every new mom, I was unsure what type of bottle to use. I bought the gift set. I used the bottles for about a month. It did help with air intake but was horrible in every other way. The seal at the bottom never sealed right. I boiled them every week like recommended. Everytime I fed my daughter, formula would leak. I started to use the normal Evenflo bottles like my mom used. They work great. My daughter is now 5 months old and has less problems with gas now then when she was younger. Due to the bottle, I don't know. But I think these bottles are a waste of money!"
2,Not satisfied,I wasn't happy using these bottles at all. As many others said it takes time for your baby to adjust to the nipples but I don't recommend using the stage 1 nipple. It needs to have a bigger opening for a faster flow. Also a few times the nipple collapsed and then I had to take apart the bottle and stretch the vent. These bottles definitely require a lot of work. (just read the other reviews about cleaning)Im currently using Avent bottles that are able to be used with a bottle warmer and don't require a lot of work. :)
3,Works for less air but are bad in every other way,"I only use these bottles because my baby had alot of problems with gas on other bottles. This was the only bottle that would stop all the dicomfort my baby was in. However for me... I hate them. They leak all the time even with carefully putting them together, there are six pieces to each bottle (that means ALOT of cleaning), you can not steam sterilize the nipples and disks, you have to stretch the disk because the holes get stuck. The nipple colapse all the time and to fix I have to keep adjusting how tight the top is. The nipple has only two stages. With the stage 1 my baby doesn't get enough milk and gets fussy trying to suck so hard, the stage 2 gives to much milk and he acts like he is choking. So I had to open all the stage 2 nipples with a pin and now they are not all even but at least he can get the milk. But since I care more about my babies comfort then mine I stick with these."
2,"Ok, but there are better out there","I started my son on the Playtex disposable nursers, and then switched to the Ventairs, because it got a little expensive buying the liners all the time. The ventairs worked well, and my son liked them, however you have to keep replacing the bottles, because over time mildew starts collecting in the holes on the disks. I went back to the Playtex disposable nursers, he does just fine with those too. Overall, the ventairs are a good bottle, but you have to keep a close eye on the disks........"
1,These are not what I expected....,"After an hour of being in the store staring at the aisle of bottles and reading the packages I thought these bottles would be the best for my first baby (what little did I know!). After about a week and a half of frustrated feedings, I switched to Platex Nurser Drop Ins. The VentAire nipples constantly collapsed. The stage 1 nipples were way too slow and my daughter just sucked and got nothing. The stage 2 nipples were way too fast and she choked all the time. Once on the Platex Nurser for 2 feedings she was doing much better, less gassy and such a happy baby!"
1,DO NOT RECOMMEND!!,"I'm surprised to read any good reviews on the VentAire bottles! I had the worst problems with these bottles. I read some of the recent reviews and I boiled the nipples and vent piece for 5 minutes and still had problems with nipples collapsing, milk not coming out and leaking! When you have a newborn baby and you're trying to feed him/her every three hours, these problems should not be occuring!! A problem with a bottle should not even exist! I never even thought to look at the reviews before I bought them because who would have thought a bottle would be a problem! My baby would get so tired from me messing with these bottles trying to get them to work that she'd fall asleep before finishing her feeding, which would then mess up her whole sleep/eating schedule. It sounds to me like it doesn't happen all the time, but who wants to even mess with it! I would recommend Dr. Brown's! I switched to Dr. Brown's and have never had a problem with the bottles or my baby having gas, etc..."
3,could have done without these,"I got these bottles as a shower gift. I have 3 kids and used the Playtex disposable with the first two. I did give these a try, they are OK. Once my baby wanted to hold the bottle himself, I began to not even use these. I was afraid he would get too much air in his tummy with these as opposed to the disposable that you can squeeze all the air out."
5,Great Bottles,For my sisters baby shower she got about 20 of these bottles for her little boy. I don't now what she would do without them. Austin will not take any other kind of bottle. These bottles are great because the baby dosn't have to stop eating to let air into the bottle because of the vent and less bubbles get to the baby's tummy because the air doesn't mix with the formula.
2,Very complicated and expensive,"I bought this system for my son because I was looking for a very low flow nipple to help prevent his gas. The primary problem with this system is the vent: 1) As a sleep-deprived parent, the simpler the better. I in a sleep-deprived haze have forgotten to put the vent in when assembling the bottle and have gotten formula everywhere as a result; 2) the vent and the bottom piece assembly must be very dry when assembled (so you have to dry everything with a paper towel before assembling because even a dishwasher with a dry cycle doesn't make them dry) or they leak--and you get formula everywhere; 3) you can't buy replacement vents anyhwhere except from Playtex. This is a problem since the vents will fall out of many dishwasher baskets and 4) You can't use an electric bottle warmer to heat the bottles. All in all, the Dr. Brown's system is better. This system isn't worth the expense."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY !!,"I bought 8 of these bottles for my daughter before she was born, and received 3 more as gifts. I HATE them because the rubber bottom pieces leak! One of the bottles leaked from the very first time I used it. FIVE more began leaking this week .. and my daughter in only 2 1/2 months old! I called the company to make a complaint, and to see if I could get replacements .. but nope, they said I would have to ODRER and PAY FOR replacements. I'm sorry, but if the product is that faulty, no one should have to pay to fix their mistakes. Oh, and if you have to feed your kid one of the thicker formulas .. it barely flows out of the stage 1 nipples, and comes out of the stage 2 nipples so fast that my daughter practically chokes. So I was stuck between letting her not get enough or choking. I switched brands as fast as I could. I ADVISE EVERYONE TO STAY AWAY FROM THESE BOTTLES! Not worth your hard-earned money!!"
2,There are better bottles out there,"I was using DR. Browns bottles but I quickly found out I needed more. So I purchased Ventaire, I was disapointed and confused by it's design. My baby couldn't get enough milk from the nipples so I went out and bought a bigger size, he still wasn't satasfied. I use them for storage now. I never used other bottles besides Dr. Browns so these could be excellent...BUT I found Dr. Browns work a lot better, are less likely to break and are around the same price."
1,Very disappointed,"I agree with everyone else. The stage 1 nipple is too slow and the Stage 2 is too fast so you are left at 3am with a baby who gets frustrated because they are sucking so hard on a stage 1 that it collapses, then you have to unscrew the bottom, only to find yourself and everything around you covered in formula. I've been alot happier with the Avent bottles. There are just too many things that can go wrong with these bottles that most moms don't have time to troubleshoot. If it's not the collapsing Stage 1 nipple, then it's a leaky disk that ruins your clothes and furniture. Very disappointing product from playtex."
2,"great concept, poor delivery","I've found the other reviews true, the nipples just didn't work for my baby. There was no milk flow. So, I switched to the playtex disposables & they work great. So, when playtex came out w/ the ventaire naturals (9oz), reluctantly I tried those, & surprisely they work great. I'm not sure if they improved the nipples, or if the milk flows well because it's a stage 2 nipple.Either way they work fine. It is good they the bottom comes off for easy cleaning. I will say I have 2 friends that love this bottle, & it's all they've used it's always worked well for them.So, you may just want to buy the single bottle, if you're buying it yourself, so you won't waste alot of money if it doesn't work for you."
3,Leaky bottles,"These bottles were good for the few couple of months but after that the seal at the bottom began leaking (a lot). I followed the instructions the entire time of boiling them once a week and soaking them in a clorox solution. After contacting Playtex, they offer no solution but new seals for the bottom. After receiving the new seals they worked for about a month and starting leaking again. I really liked the bottles if they wouldn't leak."
4,Don't give up,"I have to admit I almost threw these bottles away. I tried every bottle, and I mean every bottle. I read 1,000 different reviews and finally I got it right. You have to stretch the vent. Make sure they all open (not too much). Stretch out the nipple (I also had to open the Stage 1 nipples). Once I did all those things it has been wonderful. When you place the vent in the cap make sure it is completely dry (it might leak if it is wet). My sweetie had a lot less gas - once we got it together."
3,momofZack,I got a set of these bottles at my baby shower. I nursed my son for about a month and then switched him to the bottle. I used these a couple of times but then I started to have problems with them leaking. We went on a car trip and when I pulled out the bottle to feed him almost half the water in bottle leaked out. The bad thing about it is that my son takes these bottles very well. I did have to start him on the stage 2 nipples because he was collapsing the stage 1 nipples. Now when I use these I have to put the water in them and leave them on the counter to see if I have the bottom plastic vent in them correctly. I think I always have them in right but most of the time I have to refill the bottles because they are leaking. I would recommend these if you have the time to make sure that they are put together right.
5,"LOVE THEM, USING THEM AGAIN","I used these bottles for my now 3 year old. I loved them! While there is some extra parts to deal with, it is well worth it. We had very little spit up with him. We are getting ready to have #2 and I can't wait to use the new ones. They have made the vents easier to remove on the new ones. Well worth it!"
1,DON'T BUY THESE,"Do not buy these bottles, or even put them on your registry. My son, who is now three months, still can't use these. Every time we try, the nipple collapses, so you have to unscrew the top or bottom four or five times in one 4-ounce feeding. I'm trying to get my money back from the company right now. If you're concerned about gas and too much spit-up and burping, use Dr. Brown's. They're super!"
1,Bad Bad Bad,"Our first feeding with the Ventaire was a solid hour of nothing. No formula got to the baby. We called and got information not included with the set. We made the adjustments and still my 1 wk old got nothing even though sucking with all her might. Another reviewer mentioned that it took two weeks for her newborn to learn to suck differently. The customer service from Playtex said to only allow the baby to suck on the tip. What?!! Baby's don't naturally do that. ...As for me, Ventaire was a waste and I am going back to the bottles that work."
1,didn't like this bottle,"I never felt like this bottle was sterile. I could scrub every other part of the bottle but the bottom vent part always seemed like there was ""something"" in it. I had great success with the Avent bottle and the Playtex bottle after I quit breastfeeding. I only had one Avent bottle that leaked and the company replaced it for me.I don't recommend this product. Once the bottle is disassembled and clean and sterile it isn't so easy to reassemble and like another review, it has to be all dry. It seemed too cumbersome to put all the pieces together especially when I had a crying baby. Often we both got soaked because the bottom wasn't quite right. It does seem like a good idea but I wasn't pleased with the actual function. My baby still had gas."
1,Poor baby!,"These bottles looked attractive at first, but we learned quickly that they are no good. We have had problems with the flow over and over as our baby struggled during feedings. Needless to say, baby was not very happy after these meals."
4,Love these bottles,I started off with the Avents. My son had the hardest time getting anything out of the 1st and 2nd stage nipples. It took 10 minutes to get 1 oz! And stage 3 was too fast. So I bought the VentAires. The only thing I noticed was that you have to stretch the nipple hole to open it up. And make sure all parts are dry before you put them back together....otherwise they'll leak. Aside from that.....I love um!
4,I'm satisfied,"We used these bottles for my little neice b/c she kept having problems with gas and a friend recommended them to us. Now I use them with my daughter. I also had problems with the nipples b/c some of the holes aren't even open. I just used a kitchen knife and cut the slots a little bigger and now they work great! Sometimes it's a pain to wash b/c there are so many pieces to take apart, but they are worth it b/c the baby has less gas. I would recommend."
2,Cannot Use In Bottle Warmer,"I thought these were the best bottles, so I registered for them for my baby shower. I got 2 packs and while preparing for our daughter's arrival, I read the package insert. You cannot use these bottles in a warmer AND when making the bottles you have to prepare the formula in a different container, then pour it into the VentAire bottle THEN wait for the bubbles to settle before feeding your baby. It definitely doesn't help when you have to take the time to fix the formula in another container, warm it up and then place it in the VentAire and wait some more. Not great when your newborn is screaming at 3am for a bottle. I'd rather buy something that I can make in 1 container and warm. This bottle makes sure you have more dishes to wash in the end. I'm sure it's a great bottle but it's unneccesary for all of the steps you have to go through before feeding your child."
5,Love Them!,I absolutely love these bottles. I have tried several different types and these are by far the best! Although there are a lot of parts to clean...it is definitely worth it. I save more time not having to change my sons clothes after every feeding! They have drastically reduced his gas and he is spitting up much less. I highly reccommend these bottles to anyone w/ a gassy baby!
4,these work great for us,"I originally used Avent bottles after a recommendation from a friend. My daughter had gas and tons of spillage out the sides of her mouth. Plus, they would leak constantly no matter how we put the tops on. We tried the Ventaire and loved them. She hardly ever has gas anymore and rarely any spillage. There are a lot of parts but after the first time of assembly, they are really easy to put together. I take them completely apart after every feeding, wash everything in the dishwasher and reassemble them. My daughter is three months old and we have had no problems with the discs or leakage. Bottom line, every baby is different and you have to find the bottle that works best for your child."
1,I HATED this bottle,I used these bottles for my son and when you wash them you have to take out the plastic thing to clean it..Well if you don't put that plastic thing in just perfectly it WELL leak..So it would always be leaking when I would pour the formula into the bottle..
1,Very bad for our baby,"These couldn't be heated with a bottle warmer, leaked, were hard to get suction going, caught so much air that the milk looked like it was cappicino froth, and our baby had so much gas with them. She would get frustrated trying to eat because it took so long. Now with the Dr. Brown bottles she eats faster and has much less gas. Plus you can see there is no froth. We are much happier!"
4,best bottles I found,"I used the playtex bottles with liners for my daughter when she was really little (0-3mos)but buying new liners all the time and having to squeeze the air out while she was screaming to eat was frustrating. I found these bottles and got one mostly because I wanted to know how they worked. I tried them and they were great, no air bubbles so no tummy ache for my daughter. I also liked that the nipples seal so they don't leak when you're travelling. The only problem I had was that the nipples wore out more quickly than other ones and I had trouble finding replacements. I'll definatly use these for my second child."
2,clean up,"These bottles were only ok for my 4 month old son. I don't know that I noticed a big enough change in him spitting up to make it worth it. There is to many little pieces to take apart and clean after each feeding, it takes enough time to clean normal bottles!!! I suggest if your baby is formula fed to use ENFAMIL LIPIL AR. This has reduced his spit up fits by at least 60%"
2,mom of twins,"these bottles are not worth the money.. they are so complicated to put together and they always leak. my daughter could not drink one bottle without spilling the formula out of the sides. please think about using another bottle, I suggest dr browns , i threw away all my ventaire once i purchased the dr browns bottles > they are definitely the best on the market."
3,too much to clean,I bought these after my son started fussing with the avent bottles. The ventaire bottles work very wellonly draw back is the cleaning it takes me forever to get one bottle cleaned since you have to take it all apart.
1,Disappointed,"These bottles were great at first, but later discovered a major flaw. Somehow a vacuum forms at times and my baby is unable to suck milk out of the bottle. I would have to unscrew the bottle every once in a while in order to release pressure. I'm sure this was incredibly frustrating for my hungry baby."
5,These Bottles are Great!!!!!,"I started out using Dr. Brown's and found that the nipple flow was way too fast for my son to handle. He couldn't swallow fast enough to keep up with the flow and was getting a lot of air. The Playtex VentAire are the third system I have tried and I love them. You have to make sure you seal the silicone disc tightly into the bottom, which is easy if both parts are dry. They usually come with Stage 2 nipples which are still too fast for my son and he is 3 months old so I purchased the Stage 1 nipples. They give him much more control over the amount of formula he gets and he is able to take a break with the nipple in his mouth, something he couldn't do with the nipple on Dr. Brown's."
1,Horrible. Thank goodness I check to see how much he drinks,I got these for my baby and they were horrible. Nothing was coming out. So what is supposed to reduce air GAVE HIM THE WORSE CASE OF GAS.
1,Hated these!,Like many of the other reviewers here I tried these because my son was spitting up a lot. With the Stage 1 nipples he wouldn't get anything out and end up getting so frustrated that he was nearly inconsolable. With the Stage 2 nipples the milk came out so fast that he choked. They need a Stage 1 1/2 nipple. I didn't use them long enough to see if they leaked or not. Very frustrating product. I solved his spitting up problem by using the orthodontic nipple by Medela.
4,Wonderful product,I love these bottles.. My daughter is very small and these have been the only nipples that she will take. The only problem I have encountered is that the back vent will just stop working. In our case the vent seemed to have developed a leak and no matter what we did it spilled formula all over the place. This bottle has helped reduce the gas that my daughter has it was a matter of just finding the right formula for her to have along with the bottle
4,"Great bottles, no gas, little spitup!","I really like these bottles! We had to use a Haberman feeder for the first couple of months, but once she was taking more than 5 oz per feeding I needed something with a larger capacity. I had bought these when pregnant, so out they came. I agree that the Stage 1 nipples are too small, I cut them with a knife to increase the opening. But even still the nipple collapses sometimes and you have to unscrew the bottom (or the top, when it's upside down!) and let the air back in the bottle. Even still, my daughter has no gas with these. I prepare three of these in the evenings, leave them in the fridge overnight and I've had no problems with leaking."
3,they are ok,It all depends on your kids if these bottles work for you or not? If the kids don't like them neither will you
4,Functional Bottle,"These bottles work well. They do their job, as designed, and reduce gas. In fact I very often try to burp my baby for several minutes and nothing happens. Spit up is greatly reduced as well.There are a lot of of parts, but they are easy to clean, albeit a bit tedious (but easier than some other bottles). I typically wash them by hand and I'm a little leery of washing them by dishwasher, I'm not sure if they'll get thoroughly clean if I leave the bottom assembled and I don't want to fish the small parts off the bottom of the dishwasher if I disassemble them.The slow nipples seemed to work best for my son. The fast made him sputter and make a mess. (Be sure to note which nipples you are using, the speed is imprinted on the nipple, and is easy to overlook).Overall, I like these bottles very much. They work well, and are more affordable compared to some of the other high end bottles."
2,Parts must be dry to work,"We have been using these bottles along with the Dr. Brown's bottles with our 3-week-old. Several nights ago she started spitting up a lot and getting fussy while feeding with the Playtex Ventaire. The problem? The bottles weren't venting properly. Because the vent is at the bottom, it needs to be completely dry in order to work, otherwise it will stick and not vent. Our bad for not drying them well enough after washing and before before assembling them, but we decided to switch exclusuvely to the Dr. Brown's because they are also made to vent, but via the tube in the middle. No spit-up or fussiness since we stopped using the Ventaire. Good concept, but requires extra effort on your part."
5,Love these bottles,"I have gone through many bottles with my daughter trying to find ones that would work for her, well I found them! I absolutely love these bottles. My daughter hasn't spit-up and has been less fussy since I have used them. I love the easy cleaning and the fact that she doesn't have to suck really hard to get something out. The only thing that I have noticed is that you have to stretch out the plastic bottom a little after you wash them or else they'll leak. Other than that I highly recommend these bottles. I am expecting another and i am going to get me a lot more!"
2,Not What I Expected,"Our 12 week old became so frustrated while using these bottles because the nipples would constantly collapse. The directions instruct you not to use an electric warmer or sterilizer. With a total of 6 parts per bottle cleaning, warming and sterilizing are completely inconvenient. I'd suggest buying an individual bottle to try it out first. In our case, these bottles weren't worth the money."
1,Disappointed,These bottles are awful. The nipple holes were too small and my son could not get anything out of them. He worked so hard to eat that he fell asleep because he was so tired from sucking and not getting any food.
1,Nipples Collapsed after 4 days!,"I read about these bottles in a magazine and bought them to use for my newborn daughter. For my first child, I used the Dr. Brown's bottles and loved them; though I did not like washing the extra pieces. Since the concept here was similar and there weren't so many pieces to the bottle, I thought I'd try them. Big mistake! I tried them for 4 days. It took over an hour just to give her a bottle each time with this system. On the fourth day, 4 of the six nipples collapsed! It was ridiculous. A six pound newborn should not be able to do that to any nipple - never mind after only 4 days. Don't waste your money. I went back to the old reliable Dr Brown's bottles. They are the best and I decided that she was more than worth the few extra minutes it required to clean them."
1,Collapsing and no flow nipples,"I had received and bought many of these playtex bottles before my daughter was born. Lesson, try a bottle and nipple first. I have wasted about $60.00 dollars on these bottles. I have a whole cabinet full and they are not being used. The nipples collapse terrible, I had to pull it out of her mouth every few sips and inflate it, also,a very weak flow. My daughter eats a lot and fast, she could'nt be satisfied with these bottles even when she was a newborn. Very dissapointed and a waste of a lot of money."
1,horrible product!!!!!,"I truly should have read the reviews before purchasing these bottles. They are HORRIBLE!! I absolutely agree that the stage 1 nipples are almost impossible for the baby to get any milk. The stage 2 nipple is even worse for a newborn because of the fast flow. Unfortunately there is no in-between. Another problem we experienced is milk leaking out. I'm sure with practice we could eventually figure it out but with caring for a newborn who has the time to try and figure it out? We switched to the gerber bottle set for newborns, works much better!"
5,a must have for any parent,hello- i am the mother of a 3 week old who would only take about 2 ounces of formula at a time and would want to eat every 2 hours-- he would also have a hard time being gasy. after i bought these(my pediatrician recommended them)he immediately took to taking a full 4 ounce bottle-no spit up or problems at all-not to mention the fact that he slept through the night for the first time with these bottles. i highly recommend that you try these--they work great
2,Lots of problems,"I got this set of bottles for my son when he was born, being attracted to the ""less bubbles"" slogan it sells. But it actually ended up being more of a hassle than anything else. The nipples would always collapse, which meant you either had to take the bottle out (always good to do to a hungry infant) and release the seal from the top, or try to be coordinated enough to unscrew the bottom portion, while keeping the bottle in the baby's mouth. Not only this, but as time went by, I found that no matter how much I cleaned the bottles, a very fine film seemed to develop. I ended up switching to the playtex nurser system with the disposable liners. Much better: less parts of have to be concerned with keeping clean and less bubbles."
3,Haven't actually tried them on my baby yet...,"I'm pregnant now and decided to buy one of these before registering for them since I heard that there is sometimes a leaking problem. I plan to breast feed but after the first few weeks I'll start to pump since I'd like my older daughter to be able to help with the feedings. I'm just wondering if the mom's who said they didn't like the stage 1's because hardly anything came out of them, switched between the breast & bottle? The stage 1's I bought say they're specifically designed for switching between the two and I'm wondering since the baby has to work a little harder to get the milk to let down from the breast if that's how the bottle nipple was designed... I guess I'll find out soon enough!!"
2,Cute to look at and that's about it!,"My mom started buying me these bottles when my son was about four months old because she liked how they looked and the ones we were using were allowing him to swallow too much air. I tried them for awhile, but they quickly grew old with me. They constantly leaked and he swallowed way too much air. He got colic and was very crabby at night time after his feedings. I tossed out these bottles and went out and bought Mr. Brown's bottles instead. Those are a God sent item. I love them and that's all we use. My son, now 6 months old, sleeps all night, hardly ever spits up, isn't colicy anymore and never swallows air. You don't even see air in the milk because of the built in air ventilation tube. They require more cleaning, but your baby will be so much happier."
5,Best bottles,When my son was born I tried every bottle and then i found these. I solved the nipple problem my first week by sticking a prong from a fork into the nipple and that was it. My son didnt like any other bottle but these. I recomend these to everyone and everyone loves them. Im pregant again and ill be using them again.
2,not all that great....,The Good:-- comfortable to hold-- easy to clean-- seem to reduce gas better than reg. bottlesThe Bad:-- measurements washed off after just 1 week (hand washed too)-- leaked-- other bottles seemed better at reducing gas (born free) for similar cost
1,Could not get to work!!,"I thought that these would be great, but could never get them to work right. Sometimes they would flow sometimes not. I would have to take the bottom off to make it work and then remember to put it back on after using them or dump it all over. To many pieces, to much trouble, I would be upset and my baby would be also! Switched to Avent and loving it!"
2,leaky bottle,These bottles leak after a few months and it's hard to find new parts for the botttom of the bottle. You almost have to buy more bottles to get new parts when they leak.
4,A name you can trust,I just wanted to say I received this set at a shower and have absolutly loved using it. I have found that my son has less gas and took to these bottles quite easily after brestfeeding. My sister recommended them to me and I want to recommend them to you. They are great! And what's even better is that there are no daily consumables.
3,"Great bottle, horrible stage 1 nipple","Love the bottle. But my son sucked for 5 minutes before I realized he wasn't getting ANYTHING out of the stage 1 nipple. Even month's later, when I decided to give the nipple another shot, he BARELY got anything out. And the stage 2 nipple was still way too fast for him. I use Gerber nipples with this bottle, despite the fact that they leak a tiny bit (because Playtex designed this bottle to not support any other kind of nipple but their own). Playtex needs to get with the program and get a Stage 1 1/2 nipple, or something. I expected more from such a great name. But I still use the bottles because I invested the money in them. Now I'm just waiting for the day when he graduates to the stage 2 nipple...no more leaky substitute nipples."
2,Not all they're cracked up to be...,"My son had a very hard time using the Stage 1 nipples, so at 3 days old he was using Stage 2. They're a hassle to put together let alone get clean if you sleepily leave any formula or breastmilk in the overnight (and if you're a normal, tired mom, you will). I did notice that he was a little less gassy when he used these bottles, but there really wasn't that much of a difference. I ended up buying a stock of Nuby bottles with medium flow teether nipples and a few Playtex Insulator bottles. If you're going to buy expensive bottles and don't want the hassle, buy Insulator bottles or Avent Vias. Insulators and Avent Vias have the breastfeeder nipples and they make it easier to switch back and forth."
4,"Great bottle, just not for my son...","I recieved this and the Playtex Nurser set as a gift for my son. The first one we tried was the Nurser because it seemed to make sense to use that when I had to use a bottle to feed my son while breastfeeding. We decided one day to try the VentAire bottle, and my son did not like it one bit. The nipple is stiffer than those of the Nurser, and he seemed to get a LOT more air while eating just through the corners of his mouth. It gave him a lot of gas, and caused him to spit up quite a bit. I think this is just my son's preference, because I saw nothing wrong with the bottles. They did not leak as they say they won't, and they were comfortable to hold while feeding. If you could use the nipples from the Nursers system with the VentAire bottles, I'm sure it would work fine for my son."
3,"OK, but time consuming","My son seems to drink better from these bottles at times but we also have the regular plastic bottles (angle ones from Walmart and not as pricey) that work fine. I just bought better nipples than the ones that were provided with the plastic bottles. They are easier to clean and you can use them in a bottle warmer. The Ventaire ones consist of taking all six parts apart to wash and they can not be heated in a bottle warmer. In addition, it does leak if you do not use your muscles to tighten the bottom of the bottle."
3,Better than Avent,"These are much better than the Avent bottles for a number reasons. Baby does not have has many problems digesting, easier for mommy to hold when feeding, and do not take as much space up in the fridge.Downside: will need a brush to really clean within the curved areas. Boiling/steaming doesn't do it alone."
3,Good and Bad,"After trying 4 different sets of bottles for my twins, I finally settled on these. Mostly because of the easy cleaning and one of my babies had problems with gas. Like others, they took 45 min to eat 1 oz. So, to fix this, I noticed that they liked the Gerber nipples. So, I put those nipples on these bottles. Finally, they could drink again!! These bottles are not good for juice. Everytime I put juice or water in them, they leak bad from the bottom. I have a few of the older versions of this bottle and they are much better. The insert for the bottom fits better and there are no leaks. They need to come up with a better idea for those bottoms!!"
1,Want to return them!!!,"I got a lot of these bottles as gifts and then bought even more so we would have a good supply when we got our son home. The angled neck and concept of the gasless feeding system seemed great, but if you can't get any formula out of the nipple, it is pointless. We had to widen the holes (some weren't even completely opened at all) with a steak knife, and even then, the flow was too slow for our son. The biggest problem comes in because the flow is faster the closer to the nipple hole the baby drinks, but most babies suck towards the back of the nipple where it more resembles the breast. When you squeeze the back of the nipple, NOTHING comes out! I wish we could return these for different bottles - it is our first day home from the hospital, and adding this to our day made it very frustrating. Think twice before buying a bunch of these!"
2,Unpleasantly surprised,"I had purchased a set of these bottles to use on road trips, thinking the angle of the bent-neck bottles would be easier for bottle-feeding my son while he was in his car seat. The Evenflo brand worked great, so I assumed all bottles with this design would. I was surprised, though, to find that the nipples kept collapsing every time my son tried to drink, & he would end up getting frustrated every time. Thinking it was a fluke (or that I was somehow doing something wrong), I tried a few more times, but to no avail; the nipples collapsed every time. If you have a baby with a strong suck reflex, I wouldn't recommend these bottles."
2,not so good,"when i brought these bottles, i thought i was getting something to help my baby boy with his gas problems. but i was wrong. these bottles didn't help one bit. there was still alot of air going through it and i saw alot of bubbles. i really don't recommmend these."
1,Bad Bottles,"I had the same problem mentioned by other reviewers with all the air getting sucked out and the bottom disc sticking causing nipple collapse. My daughter would feed for a few minutes then start screaming and it was because she couldn't get any formula, the nipple had collapsed and she was sucking her poor little brains out to get nothing!! I don't recommend these bottles!"
2,Thought this was worth 5 stars....,"I thought that these bottles were worth 5 stars until I tried the Dr. Brown's Bottles... The nipple on the Ventaire collapses and causes excess gas in my daughter's belly, where as the Dr. Brown's does not... If you want a good bottle go for the Dr. Brown's pass up the Ventaire..."
1,Very disappointed!,"I started nursing my baby and had to switch to formula, so I tried these bottles. My baby seemed to be spitting up quite a bit, so I thought they would help. I read the instructions and followed them to a T. My baby couldn't get anything out of the bottle, so I tried myself. The baby (or you) have to &quot;bite&quot; the end of the nipple to release fluid. I called Playtex, and they said that to make the nipple work, your baby should only use the tip of the nipple, not the rounded area closest to the bottle.To me, this is a little backwards, since I just spent all this time teaching my newborn not to take just the end of the nipple. I'm not quite sure how you teach a 5-week old baby to &quot;bite!&quot;Needless to say, if your baby has nursed, it may be hard for him to figure these out. I simply use other bottle nipples with the bottles I couldn't return."
2,Gassy Baby,I used these bottles 4 years ago and they were wonderful. I had a baby 3 weeks ago and I have had nothing but problems with these bottles.It seems to me like my daughter is getting nothing out of them. She is sucking a lot harder to get anything and then gets very gassy. She also throws up most of her bottle at least once a day. I switched to a different brand and she hasnt thrown up since.
5,"Awesome! Easy to clean, helps with colic","These bottles are great!They come apart easily for cleaning, they help with colic and gas, and they are easily interchangeable.Truly a great bottle! I recommend to any parents... :)"
5,VentAire,"These are grest if you are breastfeeding and need to go back to work. I used another type of bottle with my first son and after I went back to work, he would want to bottle instead. With my second, we give him bottles during the day and I feed him before and after work. Get a bottle brush as these are rather tall and thin. They are also dishwasher safe on the top rack. Just clean the nipple by hand!"
5,"great bottle, but use another nipple","I have to say, in reading some of these reviews i would have to agree with a mom from Stafford, VA. I don't understand why people say they are so hard to clean, I take ours apart and put it in a basket in the dishwasher, and when I put them together I simple screw the bottoms together and its ready to use. I will say this in all the times I have used these bottles I have not used the nipples that come with the bottle. Just due to personal preference. When I used these 4 1/2 years ago with my older daughter the bottoms didn't come apart like they due now, so they are definetely easier to clean now."
4,Great bottle....,"I used these with my daughter, I liked the fact that the bottom comes off, makes for easy cleaning. My third child is on the way, and I will use these again. I never had any trouble with them. I did notice that a few of the nipples (when I first started using them) were very slow, and not pierced all the way through, so I took a little sewing needle and repierced it...worked fine after that. I really like these! :)"
3,Nothing comes out of the nipples!!,"My 4 month old was feeding from dr. Brown's- which i think are the best bottles. but when she started eating more frequently- my brother- who is her caregiver gould not keep up the all the little inserts etc. so we switched to these. My baby cannot get any formula out of the stage 1 nipples. **however** the dr. brown's nipples fit- so we threw away the playtex stage 1 and put in the dr. brown's stage 1 instead and she is much happier. The stage 2 nipples work fine, but I don't think my baby is crazy about the fast flow."
2,Not fun to clean or assemble!,"I love the fact that my son takes well to these bottles. Unfortunately, they are such a nightmare to wash and assemble.I don't have a dishwasher, so I have to hand wash each piece. I feel like my life revolves around washing, drying and assembling bottles. My son is gassy. He burps often with them, but he feeds well.Beware of the nipple not tightening properly when you screw it on. Many times I have been sprayed by an improperly fitting nipple. Also, it's near impossible to warm this bottle up if you have cold formula. If you place it in water the bottom collects it, only to pour out when it is inverted.I give them 3 stars for my son...I give them 1 star for myself!"
2,AWFUL BOTTLES,"I bought these after my Avent bottles started to leak. At first they were okay, but then my son had trouble feeding from them. The flow was too slow and when I made the whole bigger it was too fast. Also you have to check every new nipple to make sure there is a hole at all! IF you tighten the bottom too much, the baby can't get any milk. Whenever I used these, I kept having to stop my son from eating to make sure he was not just sucking air. Also the nipple collapes ALL THE TIME. Try the Playtex Premium Nurser. It works much better."
1,Baby hated!,I brought my newborn daughter home from the hospital yesterday excited to use my new VentAire bottles instead of the little disposable similac bottles that they give you at the hospital. BIG MISTAKE! She struggled with the nipples hardly getting anything out of them. I tried both the stage one and two. I then tried the Evenflo Comfi that we received in out hospital bag. She loves it and I love it because I don't have to watch my 5 day old baby struggle to eat! I went to Babies R Us and returned the VentAires that my husband thankfully did not sterilize and bought the Evenflo Comfis. The VentAire sounded great but I am very disappointed and caution everyone who decides to use them.
4,Worth the time,We switched to these bottles when my son had a lot of problems spitting up. He still spits up but not nearly as much. We went right to the stage 2 nipple because it took forever for him to get anything out of the stage 1. It takes a little longer to wash all the parts but it is worth it.
2,Bottle Leaks,"The bottle design is great but the nipple leaks a lot. I go through a couple of bibs at each feeding. When I steralize the nipples after each use, the nipples leaks even more. I hear this a lot from people who have used the product."
1,Flimsy Nipples - Hazard,"The hole in the tip of the Stage One nipple split open after just 2 1/2 weeks, causing my daughter to take in too much formula. She suffered from vomiting and horrible gas pains after only a 2-oz feeding (she usually eats 5 oz). When I checked the bottle and rinsed the nipple, it had split so far that the nipple brush went straight through! I immediately changed back to my Avent bottle and she's had no problems. My Avent nipples have never split, caused gas or vomiting. The air flow design of the VentAire bottle may be a great concept - but beware of the flimsy nipples."
1,Hassled feedings,"I like the shape of the bottle because it makes positioning the baby slightly easier during feedings. That's it. I bought these bottles on the recommendation of three other mothers. I am very unhappy with them The stage one nipples are too slow, and the stage twos are way too fast (for a newborn). I followed the heating directions and removed the nipple during warming, but the nipples collapsed pretty often anyway. These bottles were a very difficult transition from breast to bottle. To save the cost of buying an entire new set of bottles, I bought the Nuk nipples to replace the ones that came with the VentAirs. The Nuks are much easier to eat from. The icing on the cake is the time it takes to wash the extra parts. Of course there are only two extra, but doesn't everyone feel like they are ALWAYS washing bottles anyway? Who needs the extra parts? My baby still has gas and spits up."
5,Using them with adoptive baby,"I got my baby at one month and the bottles she came with she did not like. I bought these bottles on a whim and people gave me other bottles. She will only eat from this bottle. The nipples only collapse if you heat the bottle with the nipple still on the bottle, or if you refrigerate and have used warm water to mix formula. This is simply solved by undoing and redoing nipple. Stage one nipples are perfect for her at this age. At an older age she may need stage two nipples. She has gained 1 pound in one week!!!"
1,bottles were so frustrating to use-switched....,"WE heard these bottles were great, but boy were we in for a surprise! After using them for a week, the vents stopped working properly-even after boiling them once a week like you're supposed to do. WE called playtex and they had an answer for us right away-probably because others have had the same problem??????? Well, they were very friendly...Playtex told us to pull on the vents to open the holes before each feeding. Well, it didn't work. We had to open the bottle every few minutes during feedings to let the air out. Sucking on the nipple created a vaccuum and made the nipple collapse and nothing would come out. In tears, I went to the store and bought the playtex premium nurser with collapsable liners. MUCH BETTER! We called playtex and told them about our situation and they sent us a refund for 8 bottles and extra nipples."
3,"young-bad, older-better","I saw these in the store and put them om my registry stating these were the bottles I wanted to use, so I received many of them. My daughter could not get milk from any of the nipples. I might not have been so upset if I had not have washed all 13 or so that I got, but I thought they would be great. I was very wrong. But after she got to be about 4 months or so, then she could finally get milk from them, and I used them a lot, They do have a nice shape and are easy to clean. I might recommend these, but I warn you might want to buy only one at first and give it a try!!"
5,"No fuss, no muss..","I bought the Ventaire system for my son when he was born eight months ago, as I was going to bottle feed. I love these bottles, they are easy to clean and worth the extra time to put all of the pieces together. My hot water gets hot enough to make a great bottle for my son, so I use the warming up time to put his bottle together. He has never had a problem with gas or spitting up, and now that I'm pregnant again, I can keep using them, with only having to replace the nipples."
1,OUCH! Not for Breastfeeding Moms!,"If you're trying to breastfeed--and either getting ready for daycare by pumping and filling bottles with mother's milk or supplementing with formula--you do not want to get your child these bottles. The baby's latch-on and use of the tongue (not gums) to pull down milk supply will not work on these nipples.The only way to get anything out of these bottles (both newborn and the next stage, which I bought to see if it was any better) is to BITE DOWN on the end of the nipple. OW! What Are They Thinking?!?After using a lactation consultant and getting a recommendation to try different nipples, we settled on the Playtex Premium Nurser set with wide-mouth bottles and silicon nipples that were shaped more like real breasts and more flexible like real skin."
1,Don't Buy These Bottles!,"These bottles are terrible! My son could not get a drop out of them! I really thought that these would be the best bottle for my son, but they ended up just being a total waste of money."
1,Don't bother!!!,"These bottles are awful. My 1 month old that breast feeds couldn't even get anything out of stage 1, and stage 2 was too fast and he was gassy and spitting up. I'll stick with my advent thankyou!"
1,Leaky!,I bought these for my sister and she stated that the bottoms leaked. Dr. Brown's is apparently the way to go.
1,"Great for about 8 months, then throw them out!","What a waste of money! I feel had with the marketing gimick! These were fine for about 8 months or so! I purchased about 50+ because I have twins, and needed multiple bottles. I learned that I totally wasted my money on these as they leak all over! I am so tired of cleaning out my fridge!!!! Do yourself a favor and purchase something else! I am personally throwing ALL of them in the trash and starting over with something else, maybe Dr. Browns. I am expecting again in a few months and don't need the extra aggravation of the mess to clean up and the assembly.Hope this will be useful to those contemplating these bottles."
1,after a certain period the bottles leak around seals on bottom!!!,I have found that after a certain period of time all of the bottles began to leak!!! Around the bottom!! The seal just was not efficient enough even changing the disc did not help...I had used them for about six months and then all the bottles began to leak... The only ones I have not had leak on me arethe red ones which have different discs!!!!!! My son like them but I did not!! Way to many parts and the parts all began to leak!!! That Sucks!!!!!!!
3,You have to be very careful...,"The bottles work fine, and all. But you have to be really careful about the vents, if you don't put them in just right, so all the small air holes in the bottom are covered, it leaks, and that waste formula and water."
2,"Too Complicated, we didn't use it","My daughter is 6 months old now. She is breast fed when she is with me, but I have been working 3-4 days a week since she was 3 months. These bottles were too complicated, too many pieces and I wasn't sure if I could boil them or not. The baby didn't go for the nipple. We ended up using the nuk nipple and regular bottles. Hope this review was helpful."
3,Pros and cons...,"I love the concept of these bottles. Not having a lot of experience with feeding newborns, I thought that they were working fine (and therefore have twelve of these bottles). But I soon realized that it should not take 1-2 hours for a baby to drink a couple of ounces. Poor baby. She would work so hard and fall asleep or cry from exhaustion and frustration. The stage 1 nipples kept collapsing and she was only getting a drop or two at a time. The stage 2 nipples flowed too fast for her. So I switched to Avent and have been very happy, even with the occassional leaky bottle. Now that she is 6 months, the stage 2 nipple works fine for her, so I use these bottles from time to time (they also work well if you add rice cereal to formula, which I know you're not supposed to do, but after a week or two of diahrrea, you'll try anything!)."
1,Not worth the money!!!!!!!!,"I spent alot of money on these bottles because of all the hype they receive. I was so disappointed. The nipples collapsed constantly, my daughter couldn't get anything out of the stage 1 nipples but choked on the stage 2. The bottoms leaked on some of them, and they are a pain to clean. I personally think that a hard bottle is a hard bottle, angled or vented or whatever, gas and bubbles just happen!!!!!!"
1,Leaks,"I bought these bottles when I was pregnant thinking they would be wonderful. The bottles always leaked. I cleaned like recommended, but that didn't effect the leaking. As a new mother I didn't have time to boil bottles and try to fix the leaks. I bought the old fashion Evenflo and they were just as good. I don't recommend this to anyone."
2,"Great for cleaning, poor for feeding","I purchased these bottles because of the name brand, turns out that means nothing. The nipples have such small holes in them, I had to poke new ones and my newborn son still can't suck hard enough. I just use another nipple which I'm sure completely defeats the whole purpose of the bottle. I would not recommend."
2,leaks,"I have had these bottles for 2 months. They were great for keeping air out, but the nipple is small. It's great for a new born not older than a month. After that, my baby seemed to be sucking with a little more trouble. Later the bottom of the bottles started leaking as soon as I put warm milk in them. It was frustrating. I had to throw them away. There was no use in having them anymore."
3,Dog that poops,"I gave this to my 4 year old neice and she loved it. The reason she loved it was because the dog with Barbie eats these small magnitized food beads and then poops the food. Over and over again. I had no idea when I purchased it on-line and probably wouldn't have gotten it if I had known. However, as odd as this sounds, it was a big hit. Even with my male nephews-both young and old. Probably a great gag gift for a very conscientious dog walker."
4,"so tacky, it's a must-have","The sole (but mighty) justification for the purchase of this item is that it's so crude that it will almost certainly become a classic (and discontinued, of course) collector's item. You scoop the poops, the dog then eats then, et voila: more poops.Caveat emptor: get extra ""food"" items early on because they're almost certain to disappear into carpets or into real poops when kids eat them themselves."
2,Dangerous Toy,"Dangerous Toy: I just got back from the emergency unit of my local hospital after my three year old son swallowed a few pieces of tanner's poop. I threw the toy straight to the thrash can. It could be an educational toy but definitely not worth the risk to have around young kids. The following is the manufactures info regarding this toy:Hazard: A small magnet inside the ""scooper"" accessory can come loose. Magnets found by young children can be swallowed or aspirated. If more than one magnet is swallowed, the magnets can attract each other and cause intestinal perforation or blockage, which can be fatal."
2,I don't believe it!,"The dog eats ""dog biscuits"", then expels them through a hole below the tail. Then the dog ""eats"" the expelled dog biscuits again. What is this supposed to teach? That dogs eat their own excrement? This is gross. My granddaughter picked out this Barbie in Toys R Us. Unfortunately, I did not read the discription of the toy on the package, if there was a description of a dog eating fecal material. I bought the doll because my granddaughter had earned a special treat and so far, I have had no reason to not trust Barbie. But this? I can not get over this disgusting toy. Everyone who sees it thinks it is totally gross."
2,Kinda gross,"I have to say, what was Mattel thinking? Cause serously, a dog that poops? Maybe people and dogs do in real life but this is a doll which brings to the point it's not real, and if you take a look, the dog is eating it's own poop, seriously, that's kinda nasty, and a lil bit of a dumb idea, cause they don't even let poop to be shown on TV and yet they let it come with a doll, Mattel has got to do a better job then this, this is just my opinion, if someone doesn't agree with me fine, I just said what I think, and this doll I'm not sure I would approve."
3,Ew!,"As I was on my way out of the toy store I spotted Barbie and her dog. I thought, ""Those dog treats have an odd sort of shape to them..."" The back of the box explained everything. I thought this was pretty funny because I have to supervise my dog constantly when he's outside to prevent him from eating his own poo. Now Mattel has made it into a toy. The difference is, once the ""treats"" are back in the box they magically become biscuits. I bought the Barbie because I knew no one would ever believe that such a thing would exist. I don't know if it educates children about caring for a dog. They can put the toy dog away but with a real dog it's a lot yuckier and happens multiple times a day for 10 years."
2,Scatological Dog,"My daughter asked for this toy for her birthday...I bought it only because I couldn't believe someone could think up a toy like that.... The dog that eats its own feces... over and over again.... This toy should be called Barbie in The Dante's Hell of The Scatological Dog....besides, the little pieces of fake poop are kind of easy for a child to swallow, or stick them in an ear canal or nose... the pieces are little, slick and heavy... This toy is weeeeeeird!"
4,"Barbie and Tanner aka ""Pooper Scooper Barbie""","This is the first doll my four year old daughter has specifically requested. She adores it (well, mostly the dog). My seven year old son has a great time helping her with the magnetic function. I do caution it has many small parts, we do a ""poop count"" throughout the day, as the pieces are as small as TIc-Tacs and easily lost. Something to keep in mind with smaller children, but we love the toy."
5,Best Barbie EVER,"I have resigned myself to the fact that my 7 year old princess adores Barbie and other dolls of that genre. She placed this doll on her Christmas wishlist, and without really reading the reviews, I bought it for her. I received it today and am trying to decide if I actually want to give it to her, or keep it for myself. I LOVE this doll! All of my co-workers have enjoyed my delighted giggles over Barbie and her poop eating dog- and this page has had to have had at least 50 hits from my co workers and the hilarity of the reviews! Thanks for the fun, Barbie!If it's this much fun still in the box, imagine how much fun it'll be when I can actually make the dog eat it's own poop!"
3,A Little Disappointed,"While initially we really liked this set, but the dog's ""pooping"" function broke rather quickly. Other than that it is great. Really liked the accessories and both the Barbie and the dog. Just wish it hadn't broke so soon."
1,Frustrating,"Difficult to manuever, slow moving. We bought it last Christmas and our 5 year old never requests to play this one. The description and cover were so cute, we were really disappointed with the product."
3,Easily read but not terribly memorable,"In 1969 when Bob Devaney is hired to escort a lady to an appointment and is then ambushed by some very strange criminals he finds himself drawn into a super-secret conspiracy that will change is life forever. This book is easy an easy and somewhat old fashioned read. It has a good twist at the end, which while is not totally original, gives this story a nice conclusion. I enjoyed this novel, but its one of those books you take on holidays with you if you want something to read that doesn't require a lot of thinking. If you want some light SciFi to keep you occupied on the beach then this is a good choice."
4,This is a great album - give a chance to sink in...,"It has taken me at least five full listens to get into this album. That is rare for me and the Crowes. I was on these guys from day one. Lions is very different. That's is exactly why this album is so cool. I just listened to Soul Singing loud in the headphones and it gave me goosebumps. I am telling you, if you are a fan, buy this album now! If are looking to explore The Crowes, buy Shake your Moneymaker or Amorica and then buy this album. Either way, give a few spins to sink in and enjoy... Sun, stars, earth, moon, sky, tide..."
3,interesting,"This cd is not their best effort, but it is good. The reader needs to understand that I bleed the ""crowes"" and the ""stones"". They were being experimental like all groups are after a few cd's.However, since their style is already dated you would think a little change would work in their favor. If you are true Black Crowes fan you will definitely find some value."
4,One year later...,"Well, I remember rushing out and buying LIONS last year. It took a few spins to grow on me, overall, it's a really good cd, too bad the Crowes are on ""hiatus"". Summertime just ain't the same without the Crowes on the road. 24 used LIONS cdeez for sale?!? Good God, wtf is up with that?"
1,where'd the Crowes go,"Well after I heard ""lickin'"" I thought this could be a cool cd to get. After listening to it several times I'm not sure I will listen to it again anytime soon. What happened to the melodic Crowes from the early days? This to me is a mess, it's not horrible it's just not what I like to hear from these guys. Not much of it rocks,...i.e. Opening track ""midnite from the inside out"" is really cool til the background melody grinds this puppy to a near stop. Not the best songs in the world lyrically nor musically, not compared to what they had done up until this point. Best advice, listen to all the samples and decide if it's what you like from them. ...."
3,the CD that SHOULD have followed Amorica...,"simply put, the character of this CD most resembles Amorica, the Black Crowes best CD. However, it comes a few years after the time it SHOULD have been released. Unfortuneately, in the mean time, we had to endure 3 snakes, which easily was their worst attempt at cohesion. By your side was OK, with strong moments within the hard rock side our their music, but this CD does reinforce the mid-tempo, southern rock style of the crowes. Best songs you say? Tracks 1,2,4,5,6,8,12, in particular 1,2,4,5, and 12. Have a good day."
3,Mediocre -- Crowes can do better.,"I have each Crowes record, and find something to like on each of them-- but overall Lions is a let down. That's not to say that there isn't some good material here, ie Cypress Tree and Soul Singin' ..along with Lickin' and Miracle... but the rest of it is basically rehashed and inferior examples of the things we've heard on earlier Crowes records. The Crowes peaked with Southern Harmony and Amorica, then lost it a bit, but recovered nicely with By Your Side, and the Page stuff was fun.... But Lions, aside from the previously mentoned highlights, is not up to Crowes standards, and at a number of times..."
5,Thanks for all the great music Crowes!!!!!!!,"...The Black Crowes are hands down the best band of the 90's. Pound for pound they have put out the best songs of anyone over the past decade. This CD hit me offguard at first with some of the outahere sounds. But you know what, formulaic, clean songs get old quick. I can't stop listening to this thing. It is just another exquisite piece in a legacy that will be left behind by the crowes... Hat's off Black Crowe's I'm making my first tattoo an emblem off one of your records!"
4,Great effort,"First off, I am a HUGE Black Crowes fan. Following two so-so albums, ""Three Snakes and One Charm"", and ""By Your Side"", the ""Lions"" CD re-energizes my belief in this band and their contribution to American rock and roll music. There are 9 really outstanding tracks on ""Lions"" with the strongest being ""Lickin"", ""Midnight From the Inside Out"", ""Soul Singing"", ""Young Man, Old Man"" and ""Miracle to Me"". The only thing that keeps me from giving ""Lions"" five stars are a few songs which a good A&R person should have axed including ""Losing My Mind"", ""No Use in Lying"" and ""Cypress Tree"". I hope they don't waste any of their great live performances playing these songs. Do buy it though, skip through these tracks and experience one of the finest rock and roll bands of all time."
2,Uneven at best,I had high hopes for this album after reading the good reviews here but it the same old thing as this bands last few efforts uneven and uninspired.The production is excellent but Don Was just doesn't have much to work with.This band really could get one albums worth of good material out of there last three efforts.It's a shame after there first couple of albums showed so much promise.
3,Led Crowes,"The Black Crowes have produced their most riff-heavy album, no suprise given last year's gig as Jimmy Page's backing band.Overall, this is a good thing, given the churning riffs of ""Lickin,"" ""Come On, Come On,"" and ""Cypress Tree"" (even if it nicks the riff from Southern Harmony and Musical Companion's ""No Speak, No Slave"").What's not so good is the lack of solos, especially distressing given lead guitarist Audley Freed's steller ability to shred. Come on boys, give Audley a break!"
1,Not very good at all!,"I generally like the Black Crowes from its first two CD's. Since, then however the CD's have been getting worse. I also was expecting a better CD by now, but each song on the CD just me disappointed more and more. While the sound is still the Black Crowes, this CD is a far cry from the stuff they did on the first two CD's. ..."
2,I tried to like it. . .but failed,"The review title says it all. I like the Black Crowes, and I tried to like this CD; I gave it multiple chances, but it never appealed to me. It's not the worst CD ever, and I'd pick it in a heartbeat over most of the mainstream pop pap that you hear on radio, but it's destined to gather dust on my CD shelf, I'm afraid. (Perhaps I could sell it used, but it looks like a bunch of people have beat me to that market...)"
2,"Chris Robinson, where have you gone?","I bought this Cd after hearing the radio released single ""Soul Singing"", in hopes that one of my all time favorite bands had returned to the form that made me love them years ago. Back to the stinging soul that defines albums like ""Southern Harmony"" and ""Amorica"". Unfortunately this is not the case. This album is nothing but a sad attempt at reinventing what didn't need to be. It is almost cliche. The songs are as utterly uninspiring as Chris Robinson's new found lack of soul. They have lost their edge. Please join me in a moment of silence for the Black Crowes."
2,2 1/2 stars,"This is Black Crowes worst album, hands down. I LOOOOoooVvvvEeee the Black Crowes. The soul of the band is compromised with this album, though there are a few very good songs. Black Crowes are best on the ""By Your Side"" ""Southern Harmony and Musical Companion"" and ""Three Snakes and One Charm"" albums. ""Shake Your Money Maker"" and ""Amorica"" are also very good. I expect raw, hard, blues-soul-rock by these talented fellows. Their most recent effort, ""Warpaint,"" is quality, but not the harder Black Crowes that I love.I'd love to hear another ""By Your Side"" or ""Southern Harmony and Musical Companion"" or ""Three Snakes and One Charm"" by this band (without exactly repeating themselves, which they never have)."
4,Now go get free live shows!,I believe the boys have finally melted down into one fine pot-o-luck and now you need to catch the live vibe!
4,It's an Album - PEOPLE!,If you are looking for a bunch of singles meant to satisfy the Brittney Spears fan in you -- run! This is a true album with an ebb and flow to it. The more you listen the more that surfaces with this album -- kinda like the stuff from the late 60's and early 70's - refreshing.
4,Crowes Continue Rockin'!,"""By Your Side"", the last Crowes album, found the Crowes back where they belonged after two uneven records. ""Lions"" is just as good, if not better. Can anybody out there think of a more original guitar line than the one found in ""Lickin'""? This song rocks! ""Midnight"", ""Soul Singin"", and "" Come On"" are just [great] bluesy rockers. It's nice to hear these guys becoming originators and not imitators."
5,Wow!!!,"It's really hard to say where this album ranks against their other releases. It's different, it's unique, and I absolutely love it. The Black Crowes are one of the few bands left who still play REAL rock and roll. No synthesizers..., just good, old-fashioned, blues-based rock and roll. Particularly noteworthy tracks on this CD include ""Midnight From The Inside Out"", ""Soul Singin'"", and the trippy and thunderous ""Cosmic Friend""(a definite 420 experience). So load up the CD player, kick back, and listen (smoke 'em if ya got 'em)."
1,A serious mis-step,"I've been an on-again/off-again fan since their first album and this one went into the ""sell"" pile after two listens. If I wanted to listen to a bad Led Zep tribute band, I'd seek one out. Guys, please return to your 70's R&B vibe. That's what your fans want."
3,Nothing like you'd expect,"As a local driving down the major highways and biways of conjested RT6 Cape Cod summer tourist season traffic (it stinks)the Crows, ""Soul Singing"" comes on and I turn down the windows to blar it's soulful energy in the smog filled bumper to bumper traffic. I bought the CD and thought it was good music to clean the house to with that type of energy, but after Soul Singing the CDs energy calms down and I find myself only vacumming to half speed. If your looking for energy this may not be it, I am not a Crows fan obviously but if your looking for other songs like Soul Singing thats about all your going to get off of this CD. Over all I would give it a 3 1/2 in stars. The lyrics are good and a change from todays four letter infested manage' of bubble gum pop rock metal rap that is out there. The Crows though old are still a breath of fresh air."
4,pretty good,good specs:cheap (price)good triggerpretty accurateBad Specs:chops a little with cheap paintbarrel isnt that great but is okleaks a little CO2 sometimesUpgrades:Foregripnew Barrel with holes at endOverall:this is a good beginner gun for the Price.

2,Doesn't Live Up to Its Promise,"I was prepared for a fascinating read about the life of a young boy growing up in racially-mixed neighborhoods, with the author emerging wise enough to find some major themes or concepts to bind his story together, but Honky comes off as a pastiche of different vignettes that don't leave a deep impression. The author's parents seem to me to have been eccentric and self-involved and the other characters in Conley's life just come and go, leaving no real lasting impact. The autobiography that this should have been has not yet, to my knowledge, been written."
2,Required reading for class,"As far as required reading goes, this one was uninteresting. The sociological concepts outlined in this book were very trite."
5,White Man Aint Talking Trash,I would like to shake Mr. Conley's hand because that guy got it right for a change--not all is fair and equal.
3,Not another book about the projects.,"I am so tierd of movies, books, and tv shows about the projects. I know that they exsist and that people live there. It is very tragic that people don't have enogh sense to form a better life for their families. Dalton seems like a great character, and I would liked to have been friends with him. I would have never entered his neighborhood. I didn't like the book, and I only gave it three stars because my teacher would have cried."
4,The book makes you think,"This was a textbook for class, but maybe should be a textbook for life. We have done ok to decrease racism in America, but it is not gone yet. Dalton tells his story as he tries to learn, who he is. You can learn about these things and more in this easy to read story about a boy named Dalton from the projects who learns about white privilege when he burns down an apartment or escapes punishment from school. What happens to his sister as the school tries to be gender and race attentive. When do children learn to be racist? Dalton explores this as he tells his stories of stealing babies and vacationing in Pennsylvanian with family."
3,honky,"I read this book for a sociology class,I must say ,I'am quite impress to say the least.Overall I think the book gives a perspective of growing up a minority in the inner city .Dalton also talks about being white,poor and growing up in a tough neigboorhood.Shows a different side then what we are use to hearing about the inner city.Did I enjoy reading the book for the sake of reading?no but if you are a fan of stories of this calibur than you will like honky!"
3,Interesting,"I enjoyed reading this book, largely because I too am a white person who grew up in an African-Carribean neighborhood. The book helped me to reframe some of my experiences and many of the things he said resonnated with me. I, for the first time, began to understand my white priveledge in the larger world even though I had never really had a sense of this before. Some of the writing in the book was a bit awkward and there was no mention of romantic relationships or dating and how this is effected by being the minority in the neighborhood. Overall, this was a worthy read."
1,Dish Network Deceptive Business Practices,"I have been reading the reviews and have EXACTLY the same problems with my service with DishNetwork. We won't even get into the customer service b/c that is just plain unconscionable, but my actual service is almost non-existent, I have to ""restart"" my receiver every time I turn on the TV if I want to watch anything other than local channels, sports, movie and HD channels NEVER work! I have a 942 receiver. Anyone else have this receiver? I have reason to believe the company knows it is a defective receiver yet has not recalled it or informed its customers. If you are having the same problems, email in to let me know."
1,RUN AWAY,"I got bamboozled into buying a Dish Network system over a year ago and to make a long story short, had viewable tv for about 4 months of the 12 that I had it, spent more time dealing with their customer service (or lack thereof) than I did watching my unit, have been fighting with their credit department who wants to charge me for 8 months of unwatchable service and the defective receiver(that I gladly offered to send back--they insist on charging me.) Absolutely insane how messed up that company and it's system is. Cut to the chase: This one is where I should have been with from day one. Don't make the same mistake! God help us all if Echostar (Dish's parent Co.) is allowed to purchase Direct TV. It will be back to cable for all of us."
1,"Okay product, Bad customer support","I've had to call Dish from time to time. Every time I call it takes at least 20 minutes from start to finish. I was told today that a 13 minute hold time is good. After asking if there is a direct line to a human being because 13 minutes out of my workday was too much I was told ""I'm surprised you didn't have to wait longer""."
1,WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!!,"Don't get Dish! A word of warning - I got SCREWED by Dish when I tried to use the Club Dish gift card. With it you are supposed to get free installation, 3 months free movies, $100 in credits. I have called over 5 times and e-mailed more times than that and I get a different answer everytime I call as to why I am not recieving my benefits. Dish even told me I am not considered a new customer because their records show I had an account for TWO DAYS back in 2002! Which is a complete lie! And they are unwilling to offer me any proof! ""The system is always right"" is the answer I got. I would have cancelled my account right then and there, but I'd be out the $150 I've already paid them and from the horror stories I've read about returning your dish, I feel like I need to keep it. I HATE DISH NETWORK."
5,THOUGHT PROVOKING,"An interesting movie at the end of which makes you think, ""What would I have done given the same circumstances?"""
2,bad bad day?,"I was surprised at the number of 4 and 5 star reviews; the pacing of the movie as well as the story lineleft me painfully wishing to get my 95 minutes back.Get diagnosed with terminal cancer, lose your job and your boyfriend-now what?Self indulge, self indulge, self indulge.Maybe many would try to fill their time with bought stuff and sexual encounters but isn't there a part of usthat would want to doing something good for others or heroic or at least memorable?I just could't identify with much of anything so for me it is a pass."
1,Not a guitar I'd play twice,"I found THE GUITAR to be a somewhat typical plot with a girl dying who decides to spend her remaining days doing what she wants to do the most. Evidently much of what she wants to do was to buy things she wanted especially a guitar and that is where I just couldn't buy into the movie. I guess I am just one of those people who likes a good story, well done, that makes me care about the characters and THE GUITAR just didn't do it for me. I assume many movie critics would go ""ga-ga"" over this because of its ""artistic"" imagery but I just found it somewhat painful to get through. Good thing I like Janeane Garofalo as her little part was the only part I enjoyed in the whole production. Saffron Burrows is lovely but a shallow character and actress at least given this story line. Sorry, not a favorite for me!"
4,The Guitar,"The Guitar, was beautifully shot film by first time Director Amy Redford. MS Redford has her own style of shooting a picture and telling a multi-layered story about greed and mortality. It also has a layer of following your passion in life and faceing, dealing with the outcome of doing this.I liked the message it sent and it definitely is not easy to turn off the stark reality that was in it.This film is rated R for sexual content. I gave it 4 stars because it was just a very good film, I recommend setting down and enjoying it without cell phones ringing."
1,only plays on computer,This movie does not play on the dvd player and has to be viewed only on a computer. We have never had this issue with any other dvd.
4,great indie flick,"I happen to be one of those who enjoy independent films, and this film fits the mold. A lot of people apparently did not like this movie. I think it is because they entirely miss the story's moral: Pursue the one thing in your life that brings you peace and happiness. I, for one, highly recommend this film."
3,THE GUITAR PLAYS SADLY!,"Low budget, but well acted drama about dealing with a terminal illness. Interesting concepts are displayed, and a slightly unexpected ending make this a unique piece of filmmaking. Unfortunately, a constant aura of sadness permeates the movie. Perhaps, this was the director's intention. Not a feel good movie, but worth a peak."
2,"Great first 30 mins, the rest is not worth it","I would have done the same. The movie started out with a great plot and a great actress. Mel Wilder learns that she has about 2 months to live. What does she do? Rents a lavish penthouse in NYC, buys anything and everything, becomes involved with the delivery man and the pizza delivery girl and learns to play the guitar. I would have done the same! Those first 30 minutes were excellent. But, about the middle of the film, it all went downhill. The film tries too much to make everything too perfect. I would have preferred that this movie played out likeWit(Emma Thompson).The direction and camera work is good and portrays well Mel's feelings and emotions.And the only special features is the trailer. No options for subtitles."
1,boring and ugly,"Yes, somehow I did buy this flick because of rave reviews. Mistake. Main chick not just ugly but even look like typical american tight c.nt who think world owe her. I meet them often, especially on internet, yeahh, they live in different universe.On other note the plot is primitive by any counts and appropriate for 14 century not 21th. Hollywood afraid to try anything new or fresh. But I have to admit from behind chick looks pretty cool naked."
3,A storyline that doesn't live up to the rest of the film.,"""The Guitar"" is not a bad movie. There is decent dialogue, decent acting, etc. The problem lies in the story line. It's too pat, things fall together (Finding out she's dying, loosing her job, and her boyfriend breaking up with her on one day? The only delivery people that come to her door also end up seducing her? And many others that would be spoilers?) too simply, without the complexity or underlying meaning of a more successful story line. The flashbacks, which were used too liberally to establish her childhood desire to learn the guitar, were simply irritating.In short - this movie wasn't bad, but I would have been pissed if I had paid full price for it without seeing it first."
3,Interesting film but lacks depth,"This is a film I thought sounded interesting. A woman suddenly told she's terminally ill decides to take the last months of her life to live in luxury and pursue her desires and dreams. What I found lacking here was full plot development and depth. We don't get to see much of Mel before her diagnosis and rapid transformation of her life. The plot unfolds rather quickly and comes to a neat, almost cliched ending. I thought the acting was really good and the character likable, but the film seemed self-indulgent at times... long moody ambient guitar score pieces and the main character just hanging around her loft nude for a long while before ordering new furniture and clothes. That could have been cut a bit to leave more room for developing her pre-illness character and enhancing the plot twists. I would give this 2.5 stars if Amazon allowed half-stars, as overall it was just sort of average, from my perspective."
3,"A great premise, but didn't hold my attention","**Spoiler Alert**First, I will say this film didn't hold my attention. I thought the acting was good (particularly Saffron Burrows and Isaach De Bankolé), but the story didn't do it for me. I found the plot slow and frustrating.But that's not to say it's not for everyone. I can think of friends of mine who might enjoy it...If you enjoy deep dramatic films which are mainly about character development, you may enjoy it. Also, (trying not to give too many spoilers) there are a few sultry lesbian & straight sex scenes with the main character, as she explores and discovers herself during her last days.Finally, Janeane Garofalo plays a small role here - if you like her (I do very much), you will enjoy her here also.I'm giving it a 3-star score - there's a difference between a ""bad"" movie, and something that just doesn't suit my taste."
3,Started with a bang...,"Irish actress Saffron Burrows plays Mel Wilder, a woman diagnosed with throat cancer and given two months to live. Deciding to give up her lackluster and depressing life, she plans to live out her last days to their fullest. She rents a trendy and luxurious loft in New York and maxes out her credit cards on everything that she's ever wanted, with no intention in paying it back, and sleeps with Tom, Dick and Harriet. One of her purchases is a red guitar which she learns to play with abandon, getting a new lease on life.This movie is pretty uneven, and without spoiling anything, has an implausible conclusion that just sort of makes the rest of the movie fall apart, which is a little disappointing since it really started with a bang. The extras are non-existent for the most part - just the movie's trailer."
2,Meh.,"A woman with super model looks and high limit credit cards confronts her mortality, while exploring her sexuality and, oh yeah, scratching ""learn to play the guitar"" off of her own personal ""bucket list"".I found the main character distant and unsympathetic, and the storyline implausible.For a more absorbing film about facing impending death, with richer characters, albeit with a story that requires, nay, encourages, significant suspension of disbelief, I recommend ""Henry Poole Was Here""."
3,"Not much that's new, but still worth a look","If you've read any of Covert Bailey's earlier books, this one will seem very familiar. Many sections are lifted word-for-word from previous versions of Fit or Fat. But if you're not yet a ""Covert convert,"" this is the only one of his books you need to read. The information is straightforward, accurate, easy to understand and, most of all, helpful. There's also a healthy dose of humor. You'll be healthier and happier if you get with and stay with Covert's program."
3,Old hat,"I've always been a fan of bailey and heard he retired so was excited when i saw (on the front of amazon site) that he had a new book. This book is disappointing. if it had been published 5-10 years ago what he has to say might be useful but i think he must have been pressured to pu tout another book cuz there isn't a new idea--imagine, listing the benefits of aerobics AGAIN. I give the book a 3 because it is an easy read. It would be useful for people just starting to exercise but this fan who took his advice to be a better butter burner a long ago suggests to his other fans, ""Save your money."" long term fans will be wasting their $$. I would put money on the table that this book was his publishers idea and/or someone else wrote the section on how to weight lift at home. Intrigued...is sally bailey his wife? his daughter? the woman in the picture? I did enjoy the chapter on recovery."
5,ANOTHER FITNESS CLASSIC!,This Fit or Fat book is just as great if not better than the others.I can not believe some of the negative reviews it is getting because if you want to get motivated and fit there is nobody in the industry who can explain it better than Covert.His program can benefit ANYONE no matter how out of shape you are.
5,reminder,it reminded me of all the thinks i already knew. But that is good a lot of times we fall back into bad habits
3,Same stuff different book cover,"I have owned and read the original Fit or Fat years ago? I agree with the content. At age 58 I maintain a very active life style, running, ball room dance, golf and what ever else I can fit into my week. Without the fit I would not be able to. I bought the new edition for my daughter and myself, we both agreed new information might be in there just to mixed with the old."
3,Decent book.,"For my P.E. class it felt as if we did more reading than physical activity. I learned a few things that I did not already know. Other than that, it's ok."
3,either or!?,"Sensible, logical, motivational. Packs a good punch and gets one going. Should be prescribed reading for anyone over 10."
2,Not much info,"I'll let you know what's on the video so you don't waste your time or money. First, glass on the southeast facing slopes until about 9am or so, then transition to the northwest slopes; use big glass (like 15X bino's). I saw Duwane Adams on an Archery show and thought his stuff would be awesome since the show was pretty informative, so I tried his dvd. The dvd is probably older than I am (1982). If Duwane teamed up with some of his connections in the outdoor network and produced a quality informational dvd, I'd buy it, but this one seems like he just went to walmart, bought a camcorder, and filmed himself talking about the same thing over and over again."
3,Not without interest.,"This is a not uninteresting, well written and well researched look at a very narrow aspect of the life and career of James Polk, detailing very thoroughly his role as an owner of a deep-south plantation and his relationships with his slaves. If that interests you, this is an ideal book for you to read. If you're looking for an in-depth full life biography of James Polk, or even a book that gives much insight into his career as a politician and president, or any other facet of his life than that of slaveowner, this is definitely NOT what you're looking for."
4,Short but sweet,"Given the fact that it was made for the Eurovision Song Contest, which America pretty much only knows of thanks to ABBA, it's surprising this short film is getting such a release. That said, it's a six minute ear-to-ear smile with puppet versions of ABBA (circa '74) trying to impress a slimy record company boss. Most of the dialogue is ABBA lyrics, the cameos are cute and it's just a lot of fun. A overemphasis on one character's oral fixation is the only negative. The DVD is padded with a five minute behind the scenes documentary, videos of the songs featured in the short and a picture gallery."
4,I'm a Marionette!,"LOL! A must for ABBA fans, this DVD is a make believe historical account of ABBA trying to make it in the music biz. It has the ABBA puppets auditioning for a slimy record producer and is intercerptdc with cameos of all four ABBA members -- separately of course (the image of Frida and Agnetha together is sadly computer generated--they were filmed at different locations). The dialogue is mostly lines from ABBA songs and unless you're an ABBA fan you may not get all...most...of them. There is a scene where they computer generated a scene from ABBA the Movie. They mixed it in very well I think. A good laugh and sure to please ABBA fans. It also comes with videos of 4 of their biggest hits Take a Chance on Me, The Winner Takes It All, Waterloo, and Dancing Queen.Only problem is it's too short. Only like 10 or so minutes."
5,"Funny, Funny, Funny!",I laughed so hard the first time I watched this. It's a fine addition to any ABBA fan's collection.
5,Truly MAGNIFICENT Puppetry,"True to life looks, expressions and actions of each actual performer make this video a must have for anyone that LOVES ABBA. I cannot stress it enough the amount of enjoyment that I have gotten from this masterpiece of entertainment. It was a steal for the price and I can watch it again and again..........................and I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do."
1,Disappointing,"The puppets were cute, but the show was short and the whole video was dissappointing. I wish I hadn't ordered it."
4,Interesting presentation of cartoon characters,The animation was interesting. The story line was also very good.
5,A complementary study to the Blue Cliff Record,"While it would be unfair to generalise - not everyone views Zen practice as something set in wood, according to lineage etc. (Yasutani Roshi, for instance, embraced a joint Rinzai-Soto fusion), centuries of tradition have left their mark. In some quarters at least, there is a tendency for Rinzai and Soto followers to define their schools by their differences (e.g. use of the koan, jakugo, koan-colections etc. as against 'shikantza' etc).As against such hybrid narrowness, it is fascinating to read these parallel commentaries on the Blue Cliff Record - one, by the eminent Soto master - Tenkei Denson (1648-1735) - the other by Hakuin Zenji (1685-1768), the renowned Rinzai reformer of the Tokugawa. These commentaries reveal a breadth of insight which transcends all conditioned boundaries."
1,"Nice combo unit, but it didn't last","I purchased this unit early August, 2007 for the features of a combination TV and DVD player in one unit. The DVD player lasted less than 4 months, but of course just slightly longer than the 90-day labor warranty. TV portion still worked but DVD's would eject themselves without playing between 1 and 3 seconds after loading them. Magnavox's support website had no FAQ addressing this. On the positive side, the support service was available toll-free on a Sunday afternoon, I did get to a live easily-understood support rep, and he was trying his best to be helpful. Unfortunately, all he could do was give me the address of my nearest repair facility and let me know I'd have to pay for labor. I returned the unit to the store at which I purchased it for a full refund."
1,"Nice production, but virtually no content","The bios of the characters are straight out of the CD's rule book, and do nothing to explain the differing styles of the fighters. While it's nice to have pictures of every move, there's no sense of the strengths and weaknesses of them. In short, the book is eye-candy.Apparently, amazon won't let me use a URL in a review, so here's a hint: use a search engine to look for ""Ehrgeiz"" and ""Mike Allen"". You should be able to find the 100-page ""Ehrgeiz Master's Guide: Advanced Strategy and Techniques Version"". *This* is the book Brady should have printed -- smart, opinionated, fun-to-read and contagious in its enthusiasm for the game. While it doesn't have pictures of every move, it does say which ones to use when, and why."
5,Tigger's are wonderful things!,"Why do all the best games come out at the END of a systems life? Well, I guess its a good thing the new Gameboy plays Gameboy color games too because if you have kids or are a fan of Winnie the Pooh you won't want to miss this. The gameplay itself is no major breakthrough, you just play as Tigger and collect hunny pots in various areas of the 100 Acre Woods. The graphics are some of the best I have seen though. The control is great too. I never had a problem making Tigger jump when I needed him too. I'm not quite sure why they called this ""Pooh and Tigger's Hunny Safari""? The story takes place in the woods, not the Jungle and you play as Tigger almost the entire time. Honestly though, this game deserves a look. If you've never been impressed by a gameboy games artwork this one might change your mind. The game will keep younger players busy for awhile and older players will enjoy the games old school style of gameplay."
2,"Never heard of this? Yea, don't bother.","Obscure musical I've never heard of? I have plenty, I collect and don't discriminate in my collection. I think its fun to have musicals no one has ever heard of, but I don't always enjoy listening to them. This is one of those. The music is boring. The lyrics are rather clever at times, but not engaging for a widespread audience. Maybe if your in the tax business you will get a kick out of this, but I doubt you'll listen to it more than once. The singers are classical, or at least trying to sound classical. Maybe over the top on purpose? I don't know, it doesn't work. As for a favorite song... its hard. I didn't really like any, but I think I will choose, ""Under the Table Tango,"" its got its moments."
5,Max Payne is good,"Max Payne has a good twist in video games with the slow-mo and the plot. It is good for older kids like 13 or 14 put if smaller kids under stand it, it is okay."
5,Among the best,I'll keep this short.Bullet time the best feture avalible in any game. The story line is great and easy to follow. A huge selection of weapons maltave cocktails shotgun pistal and about ten more. The are many leavels in the game its hard to stop playing once you start. There is only one bad thing Max's face expresion. This is a must buy game.
1,THE WORST GAME EVER,This is the worst game I believe ever made by rockstar games. Not only is the beginning terrbile but it just gets worse. With the exception of the matrix move I call it this game is the worst ever. What kind of sick mind would make a game where your wife and child dies in front of your eyes. What human being wants to see this. I tell you what I sure as hell dont.-JIM
1,this game will turn your kids into serial killers,"i recently rented this game for my son and i immediatly took it back when i saw how much blood and gore there was. incredible. how can people play a game where you just kill people. also, since my sons brain is just developing these ideas of killing people would have affected his brain development if i hadnt taken it away sooner. all in all, this game teaches you to be a serial killer, and i believe that all the kids who play this game excessivly will turn out this way. DONT BY THIS GAME!"
3,One time through only,"The game was more than okay, but I have to disagree with a previous poster about the replayability. Once you've played the game, you're done. Time to trade it for something else.It took me 14 hours to finish the game. The gametime versus dollars spent ratio is not very good. Buy used."
5,THIS IS A GREAT GAME !!!!!,"This is a great game !!!!! A must have for all kids and xbox owners!!! Better than Halo with its awesome graphics and wonderful storyline. Anybody who likes Bond, GTA 3, or metal gear solid should have this game.PARENTS: This is a must have for your child. I gave it to my child after testing it out myself."
3,Kill Everyone You See.,"Not much strategy in this game. You can generally have to shoot everyone you encounter. The game is linear, very linear. You go through a door, you shoot bad guys. You get out of elevator you shoot bad guys. You go around a corner you shoot bad guys.The graphic novel format is interesting, but the story is not (How is it possible to be in New York and not encounter regular people?).The game play is easy to get used to, once you master bullet time you can proceed pretty easily. And, bullet time is actually fun to use.I am currently on the last chapter and I will finish the game to see how it ends. Every once in a while when I get in the mood for a mindless shooter, I pop in Max Payne. I bought it, even-though most people told me to just rent it. I will most likely sell or give it away when I am done. Not a keeper. This game would have been on the top of the heap a few years ago, but today I think other games can beat it in every way."
2,"rent it, don't buy it.","This game is ok, but only ok. It resembles a 5cent detective novel with lots of cliches. It's trying to create atmosphere but failing miserably. Add to that it's EXTREMELY easy, boring after the 2nd level. The bullet time is over rated. I got tired of it after a while, there's no action (think the opposite of serious sam). There's no puzzles, Max enters a room and says ""the letter sat on the table like a letter sitting on the devils table"". That's a prompt for you to read the letter. Press A and the ""puzzle"" is solved. There's about 3 places where you have to find a key to open a door. That's it.If curiosity gets the better of you (as it did me) rent this game before you buy it."
4,This game is great!!!!,"I rented this game because I had heard that it was short, and yes it is now that I have had it for one day I am already halfway through the game. But there are four difficulty levels and you will want to play it time and time again because of the extreme fun and wonderful story. Yeah, the SCRIPT is a little bit crappy, NOT THE VOICE ACTING!!! Why can't people just tell the difference between voice acting and script! The voice acting is great, wonderful quality. This game really is worth buying, because it is so cheap but you could beat it just by renting. There is a very atmospheric feel to this game.NOTE TO PARENTS: This game is not very bad at all, I say that a 13 year old should be allowed to play it. Some of the cutscenes you may want to skip, but that's all. The only SC in this game is referenced, nothing is shown. If you let your children go to public schools, then they should be allowed to play this game."
3,Max Payne could have been better,"I found that the fact you had to use two hands to just control the figure dumbfounded. They could have took an example from the star wars games, even duke nukem from the past was more friendly to move around.The graphics were great, the dialog could have been better. Overall, it is a pretty kewl game to play, and I did enjoy it."
1,boring,Hours of useless dialog. Bullet time gets boring after two or three tries and the game never changes.get obi wan or halo.
1,Don't believe the hype,"Max Payne was a success for one reason - the outlandish amounts of media coverage it received prior to it's release. It received such feverish attention for one reason - Bullet time. But as it turns out, Max Payne [is bad]- for many reasons.Bullet time is a gimmick that is cool for the first 10 minutes, but almost seems designed as a coverup for the otherwise awful gameplay. Add this to the absurd level design (bad trips and tightropes, anyone?), shoddy graphics, those ridiculous comic-book cutscenes, the contrived plot... Max Payne is garbage. And to think, the ripoff that they call an ending leaves the door open for a sequel. Lord help us."
4,I don't know but I've been told...,"I haven't played this game yet on Xbox or PC, but I did read a review in The Official Playstation Magazine that said Rockstar admits this game will look better on the Xbox than the PS2. Before you start jumping all over me, let me add that I am a huge PS2 fan, but I am also getting an Xbox. That said, I am now looking for the best overall game experience regardless of the console. In this case, it sounds like the Xbox version might be a better purchase over the PS2 version."
2,O-V-E-R-R-A-T-E-D,"This game was not that great, after hearing so many great things about it, I expected to be hooked on it, I so WASN'T hooked. The bullet time gets old after a while, and the gameplay is not much other than running around shooting bad guys, and finding a key here and there to unlock a door; wow, big deal. I think Dead to Rights will be a better game.For nonstop action, I'll stick with Devil May Cry, Dante is cooler anyway."
1,Didn't work,It's an old XBOX game that wouldn't work on my XBOX 360 console. That's the risk you run getting old games.
3,OK at best,"Clearly a cheap PC-to-Xbox conversion that fails to leverage the power of the Xbox platform. The comic-book style story interruptions may appeal to comic-book geeks, but are just plain annoying if you want fast paced action. The hyperbolic NYPD and mafia stereotypes are funny at first, but they get old. The story line feels super contrived and not that compelling. Max himself eventually gets tedious. I quickly developed a huge arsenal and had little trouble wiping out all opponents so the challenge factor seemed lacking. Like I said, the game is OK at best, but get Halo first."
3,OK Game to Rent...,"I'm glad I rented this game, because I beat this game in 1 day, and it left me without the desire to play it again. This game is to easy to beat, not a very well written game, cut scenes are VERY corny and unreal. There needs to be more characters to work with. Overall I did enjoy this game for the one day I played it, but I would not buy this. Try renting it first. Graphics are very good however."
4,"I like it; but, it's really not all that....sorry","Basically, it's:Go into a room, kill a guyGo into another, kill some guysGo into another room and kill some moreThe comic/dime detective/noir tone gets old.The Matrix ""bullet time"" is kind of an (...) saver. Has NOTHING on Halo. Man, that game can be played over and over and keep you happy."
5,I Love It,"I love the atmosphere of this game. It's very dark, foreboding and spooky. The graphics still rock. If you like these type of games, then I definitely recommend Max Payne."
3,Not the best game out there.,"This game is good, but not incredible. The Bullettime feture is pretty cool, but the controlls are very poor. One flaw is the health, your health in the game goes down way to fast when you are attacked. So I only give this game three stars."
3,"not bad, not great","I never bought this game but i have played it at a friend's house all the time. I was hooked on this game, i couldn't stop. But there were some downsides, Max Payne keeps having these retarted dreams that u have to play in. Its really annoying, and seems like ur goin around in a giant circle. Anyway besides the dreams this game rocks, esspecially the slow motion."
3,Payne's great with infrequent XBox freezes,"Max Payne is a great game. Graphics are good and the novelty of bullet-time (matrix style) is cool. The sound is ""ok"" in the fact that it was recorded at many different levels and doesn't eq all that well. The game does freeze infrequently on the XBox... for instance.. I hit a stage where an auto-save occured and I incidentally was changing guns at the same time.. needless to say the XBox hung, I had to reboot and I lost my save game. When compared to HALO this game is not as good in the fact that it's replay value is limited... though I really did enjoy this game and would recommend it to any die-hard gamer. Thx."
2,Splinter Cell is MUCH better,"Max Payne would be great, if you have never played Splinter Cell.This game requires no strategy - other than jsut blasting the living guts out of everything in sight. If you like that stuff - this game is great.But - if you like to think - even just a little bit - Splinter Cell is FAR SUPERIOR.Max Payne's movements are very limited - he cannot hang, jump, bounce off of walls, or sneak around the way Sam (Splinter Cell) can.The slow mo effects are very impressive - but if you jsut blast everything in sight, you can get to the next level without using it."
1,matts review,"I think this game is meaningless, and has no piont but to just go around killing people. Every level is baseckly the same level over and over again. It ends up getting being extremely boring by the 3rd level."
4,Great game but still needs a little work,"The game is great. action packed missions based in the eyes of a new york x cop. single handedly take dow the mafia. the guns are good the sound is great on a dobly digital 5.1 (recomended) for this game. no there is no 2 player mode. one of the things that rockstar has to improve on with thier 2 leading games. Max Payne & Grand Theft Auto 3. the other thing is the game is real hard without the refil chet which is (bit (back) durring a game) you should come to the title screen) Press and hold L, R, Right thumbstick, Left thumbstick, and press white black black white white black. may not work the first few times. game play is pretty easy after that. i beat the game in 2 days.have fun Rent First"
3,"Good graphics, good story line, too voilent","This game has great matrix action and good graphics and sound and music and all the performance you need thanxs to the xbox!But alot of suggestive themes and very sad and violent...not as bad as soldier of fortune for pc but still pretty bad...I reccomend at least 15year olds or older, nothing below unless ya have your parents permission like I do!(I'm 13)"
2,"Too much hype, not enough punch....","As a big fan of Halo, I was excited for the next BIG first person shooter. Well, I'm still waiting for it. Never played it for the computer but heard all the hype about bullet-time, graphics and so on. I personally found the bullet time hard to control and not worth the effort. Also, the weapon change control was hard where looking around and moving. I tried a few different controls and nothing seemed to be any better. The levels (looks-wise and interactivness) were amazing, and the sound is good, but if you're expecting a modern day Halo, you won't find it here."
2,"If it were a movie, I'd call it a ""rental""","When I first played this, I thought perhaps they initially were going for ""the Matrix"" and just gave up. The moves are pretty cool, but it gets weird in that some levels are just ""odd"". The action is really cool, the weapons are good, but after playing a great action packed level, you run into this weird drug-like maze thing which just ruined it for me."
4,Max Paine a cool game,This game was Awesome. The control options were great the weapons were cool (love the double guns) and the graphics were great I heard some bad things about the playstation version of this game but decided to buy the x-box version anyways. Never regretted it. I can say the only bad thing was the lack of options in the pause mode. To start a new game you have to turn off the whole x-box.
3,Max Payne 1,Great start to the series with some unique features. Graphics are not as good as #2 but the story and its narration is neat to watch and listen to. Price was great and delivery by Amazon supplier was super.
5,fun game,"This is a classic game for xbox and i love it. it plays so well and has a good story. There are lots of guns and lots of bad guys, how can u go wrong."
4,plenty of violent action,"This game has taken up plenty of my time due to the engaging storyline, good graphics, and intense action violence. I would give it 5 stars except for 2 things 1: there is a problem with the save, when I use it and then beat a level instead of playing the next level I get started from the begining of the level I just beat. 2: jumping is a straight up pain in the a__. When you have to jump from one ledge to the other if you don't time your jump exactly perfect you fall and die and have to do the whole area over again, and you wouldn't beleive the frustration this causes. Over all though I'd say this is one of th most fun and addictive games i've ever played."
2,They Don't Make 'Em Like they Used To,Bought this from Amazon and the price and service was great.The product however wasn't. After installing and putting my ATV back together the winch would not work. After a bunch of trouble shooting I opened up the switch to find that the red lead had come off of it's terminal. WOW!!! The leads are not even soldered to the terminals anymore. How cheap is that!!?? My old switch had soldered terminals. So much for Made In USA. Should have made them off shore. At least they have solder over there. On the plus side Superwinch did warranty it and are sending me a replacement but how long it lasts is yet to be seen.
5,Great Information,The book had excellent information. Be careful of his seminars though. People have dropped over $1600.00 with no progress. Thanks!
4,Worth the price,"Overall, I think that this book is worth the price. I don't know about attending his seminar, but he does have a few fresh ideas to creatively improve one's financial outlook through real estate in his book (aside from the multitude of ways to have a seller carry back, rehashed time and time again in most books). Plus, much like Robert Allen's ""The Road to Wealth,"" this book is very inspiring--to know that a self-educated, persistent man could attain such a financial empire with the sweat of his brow."
2,Interesting material-but beware!,"The techniques discussed are old standards. The book really seems to be a lure to attend one of whitney's expensive seminars. You can't get something for nothing! Real Estate investing is hard work with great gambles. Russ has made his money ""selling"" techniques, not in the field."
2,I have seen better,"Hi, I have read about 10 books about wealth creation and this one is not the best. This book is more about having a ""great"" attitude rather than real example of how to buy a property. The example in the books might work but the fact is to buy a location property you need money (at least some) or equity. This book make us dream but from my point of view the examples are far from my Canadian reality."
2,I would never recommend,his biggest advice - a rooming house. For one good luck finding a house that has proper zoning for this. Politicians and neighborhoods hate these things. Not to mention the nightmare of the transient types you will attract. Also it's pretty dated as it still recommends buying RTC properties. The RTC died out years ago after the aftermath of the 80's real estate and S&L crash.
4,Good book by Whitney,"Russ Whitney has written a very good book on real estate investing. Mostimportantly, it is written by a man who has been in the trenches and knows what he is talking about.Real estate is always a great investment. Russ Whitney shows you how.Also suggest Real Estate Money Machine and Nothing Down for the 90's.Read and prosper."
4,Inspirational and Informational,"Russ Whitney is living proof that the American Dream is alive and well. I bought his book after attending a local seminar and catching his informercial.I had lousy credit. The section on credit repair was particularly useful to me. Also enjoyed the section on insider bank secrets.By the way, I re-established my credit and got approved for bank loans and credit cards after following Russ's techniques.Real Estate is still the best producer of wealth available today. Russ prooves that anyone can do and if they just pull up their sleeves and go to work.I also suggest Real Estate for Real People and Brilliant Deductions. Must reading for any serious Real Estate Investor.Great books."
4,it works,"enjoyed mr whitneys book very much . it is not only a informational book it is an inspiring work, it describes the american dream ,the title is most appropriate"
5,Great starters book,This book is a great way to understand all the secretes of the realestate industry. The book is easy to understand. And it makes it easy to put the theories into practice.
1,Should be able to purchase ONE song,Planning my reunion and doing a slideshow. I want ONE song off of this album and I'm forced to purchase the whole darn thing..? Seriously? Ripoff...didn't have to do so for other soundtracks. Ridic.
3,Not much element,"Although the title theme made me purchase this album, it isn't one that I'll plan on playing through anytime soon. There are a couple of songs that I can listen to, but as a whole, the album is mediocre at best. Unless you're a fan of the typical, superficial sounds of the '80's pop music, this album probably won't fit your fancy too much. The instrumental version of the title's love theme was quite popular for a while, but the lyrical version is almost unknown to many. Unless you're into collecting soundtracks for some reason, this one isn't one that I'd recommend."
4,A realistic look at the quality of the album.,There is so much still not known about Rob Lowe. I mean what really happened with him and that 16 year old girl. Is it true that Emilio Estevez was drunk when he married Paula Abdul. Awesome album.See ya.
3,St. Elmo's Fire...,"First let me state that I really, really like this soundtrack. My favorite song is ""If I turn you away"" with Vicky Moss. My major gripe is that Ms. Moss sounds like she's singing two city blocks away from the microphone - it's that bad. It's as if someone was trying to save a buck or two and do the mininum required to put out a song.Finally, if they remaster this disk, I'll gladly pay top dollar for it! Five stars for material, three stars for the disc!"
4,I'm rereading some old favorites.,"I have never read a Leonard book I didn't like. I get in moods and this filled a nee Not the best of his, but a good read.."
1,CD # 1 came damaged..... Item offered as new but not all cd's where...,I bought this dvd set a couple of months ago cause I love the series and wanted to watch it in quality.. But to my surprise the set came with cd # 1 damaged. What could be worst?
5,The Thunder in Paradise Made For TV Films Collection,Its about time The Thunder in Paradise Made For TV Film Collection be released onto dvd. What a great way to launch the TV Series. I just hope they release the TV Series too. Ashley Gorrell rocks.
4,Thunder in Paradise Collection,"Its a sappy action/adventure comedy with Hulk Hogan and Chris Lemon. It is set in Florida, and they play ex-Navy Seals with a prototype stealth boat, which they end up using to save the day!! I am a sucker for these B-type old TV shows. This one - like others like it, have a small but faithful fan base. Check it out - I don't think you will be disappointed...."
4,ALL of the cables are sleeved,Came with velcro cable ties which makes for a clean installation in my Zalman Fatal1ty case. The only problem I had was not knowing which way the 4 pin extension on the 24 pin mother board connector went in. Of course I got it backwards and I thought for sure it was DOA. So as a guess I reversed it (should not be possible) and all is OK now. There are two very tiny tabs that face the (mating) 20 pin. Actually they do not mate and that is the problem. They really need to correct this.
1,Don't buy more than one Guys Gone Wild Video,"I bought ""Guys Gone Wild Spring Break Explosion"" and Guys Gone Wild Heat Stroke"". Both videos use THE SAME FOOTAGE! They are basically the same video packaged under different names so the company can make more revenue. DON""T BE FOOLED!"
2,Best Listened to with sound down,Ok once you've seen one guys gone wild DVD you've seen them all. What is it that makes people love it so much? Heat Stroke probably has more cute guys than the other ones I've seen but for the most part they're just a bunch of nude college boys walking around with limpies and let's just say there usually isn't much to see in that department. Are people so desperate to see nude young guys we actually drool over microspic limpies? Please. And for the camera girls - please just keep quiet and hold the camera.
1,OMG,"Soooo pathetic... and desparate. I kinda thought that this would be hot, or at least fun(ny), but nooooo! The guys are so drunk, homely and just plain sad, I couldn't even watch it through. I hope they got paid; or even better, that they were in a collective blackout so they don't suffer acutely from the shame when they grow up!"
1,THIS IS JUNK,One of the wrenches fell apart the first time it was used!!! The gear mechanism was very flimsy and light weight; complete junk. The sears brand is much more expensive but a better option since it comes with a lifetime guarantee.
5,Realistic Journey,"""The Road to Paradise"" chronicles the journey of friends to the magical land of Paradise. Readers are taken along for a fantastical ride through lands of mystery and danger. There's never a moment of boredom in this wonderful journey to be enjoyed by all. The journey reflects many conflicts of real life, but they are simplified to appear realistically in such a short book.This book shows the reality of needing change and the fear of change. Each step of the journey teaches a lesson that could help my daily life. The lessons are presented in simple and broad terms that assist in understanding the letdowns and horrors of life.Try it out yourself and feel the magic of childhood once again."
4,fun novelty toy,fun novelty toy for Barbie-lovers as well as Equestrians. Our 5-year-old plays with her horse without the Barbie. Our 3-year-old likes Barbie to be riding on her horse.
4,Nicest horse I've seen.,"This tawny horse is great. It actually walks but has to be on a hard floor as the directions will state. But, the thing I didn't like was you can not just turn on the horse without it walking. It whinnies and legs bend and moves as it trots across the floor. We were suprised how fast it actually walks, it was kind of amazing to see it take off. It whinnies when it's head it pressed down but as I mentioned you can't play with it's extra features without it walking."
2,don't buy if you want it too work!,"as others, out of the box, worked for a few minutes, then the clicking noise began. exchanged it at target, second one does the same thing! i couldn't believe it! thought is was the first horse, but seems to be the product it self. daughter loves it though, so we are stuck shaking it around until it decides it wants to walk again..."
4,great horse,This horse is very nice. It makes wonderful noises and walks great on a hard floor. My daughter loves to have her Barbies ride her and loves to style her mane.
5,~I love this Horse~,I still have this same horse when it first came out and it still works to this day. This Horse is a great Christmas or Birthday Present to a Horse Lover! I never had a problem with the first generation of this horse. If they are sold out in stores try ebay for barbie or the horse. A++++
4,My daughter loves it!,"It even walks on our berber carpet! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it tends to walk to the right instead of straight. My daughter doesn't seem to mind so we'll keep it. Barbie rides well on it, too! Overall, I'd say it's a wonderful toy and I would recommend it."
4,Great toy,I got this for my daughter and niece. They both love their horses! These are great and walk down the hall with Barbie on it with no problem. I highly recommend this toy!
3,Majestic Mane is a mess,"I bought this horse for my horse crazy 3rd grader. The bit & saddle are a little hard to remove for her but she seems to like it. I am finding it hard to find a cowgirl Barbie that is not $50.00 or more. Most Barbies will not ride as their legs are not flexible to straddle the horse.My chief complaint on the horse is the typical Barbie hair mane. After 2 uses, the mane is such a mess we are considering cutting off the bottom inch or so to get rid of the frizz. So, in my opinion, it should have never been marketed to be styled.It does neigh - everyone in the family is aware when it is on. It does move well on flat surfaces but forget it on carpet - which her bedroom is. So, she has to gallop and neigh in the kitchen - grreat..."
4,4 year old LOVES this!,Our 4 year old loves this horse and the stable that is available too. She plays it all the time. She thinks it is so funny that Tawny can walk by herself. Great buy!
5,My niece loved it,I didn't even realize it walks. I thought it just neighed. my niece loves my pretty ponies and long hair so I thought this would appeal to her and she could play with her Barbies.
5,Wonderful horse!!,"This is a great toy. It moves like a real horse, and is so realistic. My granddaughter loved it!!!"
2,Fun - but inconsistent,"I goit this for my 5 year old horse mad daughter for Christmas. It's GREAT fun - but doesn't always work. Just when I think I have to wrap it up and return it - it starts working again. It's SUCH a cool toy - it's a major bummer when Barbie can't take her afternoon ride as scheduled! I'm glad I got it, but my little one hardly ever uses it now (early January) beacuse it's unreliable."
3,Not a Riding Horse,My daughter got Barbie and the horse for Christmas. She was very frustrated when Barbie didn't fit on the horse. We had to go buy another Barbie that would fit but still she didn't stay on and keeps falling off. My daughter is 4 years old and wanted everyone to know this.
1,Would highly not recommend!,"I used this product as a professional stylist only because Chi provides them free to my salon...they are too hot (burn people) and there is not an easy cool shot button...the cool shot button has three heat settings:cool, very hot and scalding blisters...I would suggest the Bespoke T3 1800 watt unit for the consumer desiring salon results, it is lightweight but very powerful and fairly simple to use...be sure to lock in your style w/ the cool shot for a second or two for super shiny sleek hair (w/ any dryer)...i also love the solano super but it is fairly heavy"
3,Farouk CHI GF3000N Ceramic Ionic Hair Dryer with Nano Technology,"The blower dryer works but I am convenienced it is not new as they advertisied it was. It sounds like a used blow dryer and makes a noise that looks like it will break any second also the packaging that it came in was horrible.MV Miami, FL"
1,2nd broken CHI- not worth the high price!,"This is my second CHI dryer that broke in under two years of use. They are not made well. The heating element broke on both dryers, but there's no way to repair or replace. Overpriced for the short lifespan of the dryer."
4,Nice dryer,I had read some reviews and wanted a dryer that would cut down on my drying time. I don't think this one does it much quicker however it does work great. My hair is much tamer after drying it with this dryer. The heat gets VERY hot. I use a Sedu flat iron afterwards and love the results. I've only used it for two weeks but so far is does work well.
1,Nano Chi Hair Dryer,"For the reputation and cost of this hair dryer, it's not worth it. I have searched high and low for a good dryer because I have very thick hair and I got excited about this product. It is not worth the money at all. I returned it, and went back to using my 20.99 special from Target, which actually works better than the Chi."
3,Don Giovanni,I am disappointed. It does not have subtitle. Had I known before hand I would not have ordered it.
2,So...so..,"Not bad. Author knows what he talking about, but its mainly geared to an inboard boat. Basically, the theory seemed to be, ""if you can dock an inboard, you can dock the rest."" I liked the ""7 steps to successful docking"" much better."
4,Quick read,"This book proved to be very useful, filled with practical information with a little humor salted in. My initial criticism was that the book is geared more to single engine boats than twin screws, but I realized as I read on that the single engine basics, once understood, more than apply to twin engine boats. This is a quick read and a couple of hours spent with this book will save you hundreds of hours (and dollars) of boat and dock repair!"
3,"Interesting, but a little dated","This is a well written boot with lots of good insight, but it's almost entirely centered around inboard driven boats. It does try to explain how an I/O might be different, but somehow I spent all my time trying to translate the inboard instructions to how an IO might act. Add a duoprop to your IO and now you're translating even more. This book needs an update to reflect the equipment owned my the majority of recreational boaters these days."
5,return communication.............,"Because I apparently made an error in ordering a book instead of the CD set, it was necessary to return the order unopened. The return and contact with the seller was polite and professional. 5 stars to him.Lory Karcz"
3,Chock Full Of Heaviness,"Not their best album, but Power of the Night has some keepers. The best are ""In the Dream,"" ""Warriors,"" and ""Hard for Love."" Their lyrics sound very interesting on this album. Give it a try."
4,POWER OF THE NIGHT is a pretty good record.,"I imagine that POTN works better as a tape or LP than as a CD, mainly because there you have the fantastic songs on one side, and the mainly lackluster stuff on the other. Besides having a phenomenal title track (Savatage always has been good with title tracks), other excellent tunes include the crunching, bleak ""Unusual,"" and the soft, introspective ballad (note: not ""power,"" just ballad) ""In the Dream,"" whcih still seems somehow out of place among the dark and heavy songs. Of course, here you get some of Jon Oliva's patented sick innuendo songs, and you can guess which ones these are from the titles alone (interestingly enough, ""Necrophilia"" is not one of these). A few other standouts include the blisteringly played ""Washed Out"" (must have been hard on the late Criss Oliva's hands to play like that) and ""Warriors,"" a good example of Savatage's shifty song structures."
3,Average Savatage,"This is one of the worst Sava albums (probably better than Fight For The Rock only...) The songs are poor. Hard For Love is the weakest Sava song ever, so poppish it is. Bon Jovi would have done better. The only bright spot here is the fast Washed Out, very similar to Rage from Sirens. For sure this is not the CD one should listen from such a great band, specially for first-time listeners."
5,Savatage rocks,"This disc brings back some great 80s rock to my collection....had to have it once I saw it,excellent savatage recording"
2,"Not bad, but definitely not good either","The book is useful if you are not new to SAS, however there are definitely better written books available. Comparing a code (given as example) and its output are often hard to follow as the text says nothing about the data file structure. The spelling errors (admittedly few) are very annoying. One doesn't expect them in professionally written text."
3,Before the high country!,"Slightly disappointing Scott/Boetticher western with Comanches looking more like Mohicans when you look at their haircut. Nancy Gates had been held prisoner at the Comanches, but looks more like she just came from tea with her aunt on a Sunday afternoon. Some nice photography, though - and Scott has a beautiful pony in this one!"
4,One of the great Westerns.,"this astounding Western mixes a modernist treatment of space (look at the way Boetticher grids the West, through composition, editing and camerawork) with a story of mythological force - a man spends his life wandering deserts looking for his probably dead wife. The ironical sense of an imprisoning West creates a sense of the Hell to which Cody has been condemned. This enforced loneliness is not mere self-pitying - the old ideals of the West have been debased by genocide and greed; solitude is the only moral stand possible, and yet it cuts one off from family or community. Heartbreaking."
5,Great for Teachers!,I have this book in my classroom and every student has read every joke. Your kids will love it! Tara Winslow
2,Boring Summer,"The book is not as bad as some I've read, but the plot is pretty predictable and the ending leaves a lot to be desired. If you want a good mystery I would read a book by Caroline B. Cooney, such as Wanted! or Losing Christina."
3,Fast efficient narrative....,"Cici and family returns to a lake and finds herself turning into a semi-sleuth. The narrative runs smoothly and makes for fast efficient reading. Once started, it is quite difficult to stop, thanks to the interest-enough storyline. The writing style is crisp and clear.However, this book is no where among the great books for teenagers. From a moral perspective, the relationships among the teenagers are far from ideal and certainly not exemplary. Furthermore, there is hardly much in this book that caters for character building."
3,it was very predictable and there was no twist in it .,"In this book, Cici goes to her lake house very excited because she didn't go last year. But she is dissapointed because she finds out that her crush's older bro is convicted to murder of the camp flirt. She doesn't think he did it and so she sets out to find the truth, and she does. She tells the cops and it all ends up like you think it will. It was an okay book."
2,I hated this book!!!!,"I really don't remember much about this book except that I read it in seventh grade and hated it! Now I am in ninth grade and my friend who I borrowed the book from brought it up. I came here to amazon to see what other people thought of it. I can't believe peolpe like it! Well, if you like sick, stupid, twisted books then read it. If you want something good to read I reccoment To Kill a Mocking Bird or Jurassic Park."
4,A good mystery!,"This book was one that I read whenever I got a chance. I found it hard to stop when I had to. It wasn't the best book that I ever read, but it was pretty good. The characters were easy to relate to and most of the incidents could really happen."
5,A murder has occored and CiCi has to find the killer!,"A wonderful book full of twists and turns of mystery. A young girl CiCi goes to her Grandmothers cabin for the summer, thinking it would be the best summer of her life. As she find out there was a MURDER last summer. During this summer of mysrery CiCi finds the real killer is someone in her own family."
3,Twisted summer,"I think Twisted Summer was an ok book. Except you can suspect what will happen, and of course Cici, the main character, gets in danger and her crush saves her. Pretty much like many other books. Willo Davis roberts also wrote a book called, ""Don't Hurt Laurie"" that I liked a lot more."
4,Twisted Summer,Cici who was always considered a little kid is now 14 hoping to be accepted by the older kids on the island. However when she arrives on the island after missing a summer she discovers that Zoe had been murdered the summer she missed in a cottage. She also learns that the person they accused for murdering Zoe and is in prison is her family cooks son. She also has the hugest crush on his brother. Cici is sure they have the wrong guy and when she starts finding clues she wished she would never had went looking for them. This murder mystery might just be connected to her family more than she ever thought it would be. This is a great book it started slow but it got really interesting. This is the kind of book that you can't stop reading you wanna know who did it. So do you really wanna know who did it it was her close friend one she never thought could do something like that.....?
4,Mysteriously Twisted,This is one of the most intriging books I have ever read. It really makes you want to read on even if reading is not your thing. The book always has forks in the road and you never know what to decide. The whole murder thing is mysterious and confusing. This book also has a romance theme in it. A girl whose cousin's hate her and she hates them. I definately reccomend this book to anyone who likes mysteries and/or has had not quite so memorable summer.
5,Nothing Can Express To You The Loveliness Of My Only Lord Jesus,"This book is so achingly wonderful and ever so lovely.Buy twenty and give them out as gifts.These are perhaps some of the most beautiful poetic statements about our beautiful Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.There are way too many to jot here but let me leave you with this:""I find Christ to be Christ, and that he is far, far, even infinite heaven's height above man. And that is all our happiness. Sinners can do nothing but make wounds that Christ may heal them; and make debts, that he may pay them; and make falls, that he may raise them; and make deaths, that he may quicken them; and spin out and dig hells to themselves, that he may ransom them."""
3,Binding not as advertised,"Very disappointed that this book is *not* leather. Saw it available from another site, but I paid *more* to get it from Amazon because it was advertised as leather. I've seen this type of binding advertised as 'TruTone' elsewhere. It is a nice binding, but definitely not leather. It also states that there are 128 pages. This book has 108. Perhaps Amazon had a different edition at one time, and substituted it with this one without updating product information? I was quite disappointed with Amazon, since I was expecting them to deliver what they advertised."
2,Thin and not very helpful.,I read this book in about two hours--and that was about thirty minutes more than it should have taken. The intent is good but Sweet is short on helpful particulars. A book like Buzz McLaughlin's THE PLAYWRIGHT'S PROCESS actually offers what this one promises.
4,The Dramatist's Toolkit,"I found in this book more *useful* information per page than in anything else I have read about the craft of playwrighting. I disagree with Michael D's comments, especially the one about Sweet writing obsequiously about Tennessee Williams. If you can't go overboard, even come off like a gushing fan over Williams, then your theatre is probably not my kind of theatre.It's a very short book, which attests to its modest but very thorough goals of creating an essential framerwork for the novice or professional writer. I have re-read it more than once, and I find that, like a car in need of maintenance, or the regularity required to achieve results at the gym, this little book is the how-to manual to keep straight on the playwright track."
5,Refreshing and innovative,"Sweet treats playwriting as both an artform and a craft and squeezes seventeen chapters of playwriting wisdom inmto a slim 162-page book. He accomplishes this by avoiding prescription and embracing a methodology that allows readers to involve themselves in the practice. There is not a single exercise in the book. Instead, Sweet discusses the nature and purpose of writing for the stage by using examples as diverse as A Streetcar Named Desire and Sister Mary Ignatius Explains It All For You. Perhaps the centerpiece of the book is his discussion of negotiation which begins in the second chapter and continues throughout the book. For more elaboration, please see my review of The Dramatists Toolkit in the March 1995 Theatre Journal, pp. 164-6."
3,DVD Tiesto,"i heard the DVDA, & i think that this will be a great video better than tiesto concert 2. the DVDA almost 4 hours, great track from his element of life CD album."
5,Amazing trance,Tiesto's epicness shows in this amazing show. I have always loved his shows and this just became my favorite of his dvd's
2,So so,"Was a little disappointed. Just my opinion, but found this video to be boring. I love Tiesto, music is great. Video is just boring."
1,Volume fades in and out,"Don't buy this expecting perfectly normal volume playback on high volumes, it fades in and out. I compared this DVD to my ""U2 Live 2005"" (Chicago) DVD and it was perfect at the same volume. I guess this ruled out my DVD player (Apple Mac Mini) and speaker combo."
5,Magestical Piece of Art!,This is the most amazing thing I've ever seen. Thw whole DVD's are fantastic to party and full of Tisto's Magical Songs. The performances by Christian Burns and Julie Thompson are amazin'.This is definively a must have! You can't miss it ;)
5,Simply amazing,"I'm a huge Tiesto fan. I saw him twice last year, and I have to say these dvds (2 of them) exceeded my expectations. If you are a trance/edm/Tiesto fan you MUST buy this! You won't be disappointed. Great value, $15 for 2 dvds."
5,More of the Best,Tiesto is not the king of the hill; he is the god of the mountain.Texas loves you Tijs.Enough Said.
2,Bad choice for Kindle,"I bought this to be a portable version for my Kindle. However, it is formated (Like all Kindle books, I guess) to be read from front to back - useless for a reference book. It needs to have an index that can be used as searchable links. Locate the section that you want to read, click on it and go there. Trying to do so is a three step process and it doesn't work very well.I guess that I am still comitted to carry my hard copy with me."
3,Good if you're new to a Board of Directors,"I was elected President of my condo association's Board of Directors. I knew nothing of the rules of how a Board meeting was operated. A friend told me to purchase this book. It certainly does provide the information, but there is so much of it and it is extremely boring to read. Great as a reference."
2,Not suitable for kindle,"The substance of the book may be fine, but it is not suitable in a kindle format (which is how I had it delivered). The pagination is a mess, very difficult to navigate, and frankly a frustrating read as an electronic book. I was hoping I would be able to use it in meetings by quickly accessing it via my iPad. No chance of that."
1,Roberts Rules of Order,"Bought this thinking it would be helpful in running meeting. Problem is, no table of contents. You have to go page by page. Useless and a waste of money."
5,"Roberts Rules of Order (Newly Revised, 10th Edition)",The most authoritive book on meeting procedure on the market. No other even comes close to being so exact.
2,mind-numbing,"I'm no idyot butte I'm also no Eyenstein;) These tapes made me think that I had a stroke. No context for these rules of order was given. I am thinking of using them to induce myself into a hypnotic trance during intense traffic. I bought a couple of books since this dreary purchase and I find, for myself, that reading about RRoO works better for me.Additionally, these are cassette tapes. I mistakenly thought that I was going to get CDs. I can't believe that people still deal in cassette tapes. What's next? Stone tablets?"
4,Robert's Rules of Order: Newly Revised (10th Edition),"This is a very well written book, although at time to be a bit wordy, but it serves the purpose."
4,Great reference!,The complete Robert's Rules is a bit cumbersome but very well worth wading through. So much usefull information is at your fingertips with this text. With so many involved in either community or professional groups this is pretty much the prerequisite to any smooth running meeting. I would give it five stars for content but the shear amount of information does make it a bit difficult to do a very quick reference.
3,Always wondered what RR of O looked like on paper,"I just wanted to refresh my memory from days gone by when I served on panels and boards in school which required Robert's Rules of Order. I'm again involved in boards and formal organizations where I have to be familiar with the process. This is a quick reference guide. You can get the same information on the web, probably in Wikipedia or something like it."
1,Avoid the Kindle version buy the book,"Robert's Rules is indeed THE authoritative text. Unfortunately, like many books in the Kindle library, it has been badly converted from the print version. Quit apart from the usual slipshod OCR work and lack of proofreading, the tables of motions have been included as images, not text. If you think you will be able to quickly find something like ""can an appeal from the decision of the chair interrupt a speaker"" think again.BUY THE PRINT BOOK, not this"
4,A Must-Have for the Serious Leader,"As the newly installed president of Rising Star Toastmasters Club 1653, I felt this was an important investment. If I'm to conduct meetings, I should have this guide handy. The book arrived ahead of schedule and in pristine condition. If I were to have bought it new, I would have paid twice as much even with the shipping cost."
2,"Definitive source, but formatting is an issue","Necessary for anyone trying to keep order in a meeting, but the formatting for Kindle makes it really difficult to use."
1,"rRBERT,S RULES OF ORDER","I ordered the hardback as I was expecting a REAL book. Instead I received a paperback with a hard cover. The print is too small to read and it is completely useless to me. I also paid fed ex for fast delivery and that money is wasted as well because I cannot use the book,because it is so small."
2,How Did You Paint That?,This book is a nice book with a lot of nice pictures and reviews of these pictures from the painters. But the painters did not go into any specifications about how they made the water look so real or what type of brushes they used. There are no directions or instructions on how to reproduce one of the paintings. I was looking for a book on how to paint real looking pictures for advanced painters and this was not that book.
3,For beginners,"Frankly, punctuation is terrible. This book will be helpful for people who are not interested in the technical(mathematical) side of the Game theory, but are interested to know some general concepts and ideas."
3,Game Theory for beginner,"It is a good beginnig for the study of Game Theory. It should be easy or thecnical, but every correct."
4,Great Resource,"As a brief reference guide to any and all of the big bands, this book can't be beat. I own several similar books by other authors, but as a summary bio, this is the best!"
5,The best book of its type I've ever read.,"I've worn the cover off mine. Mr. Harvey, if you are listening.........please.........Let us have a reprint in hardback.......and maybe even volume two... Clay Harvey is the best hardcore rife/hunting author since Jack O'Connor..."
4,"Hey, take a peek at this.","Inexpensive collection of Beardsley's black & white illustrations, mostly taken from other Beardsley books in the Dover catalogue. Some erotic penwork, but Aubrey's ""obscene"" art is quite tame by today's standards. Some of it even adorned the covers of magazines in his own time. Of course, the big value of this collection is that it's copyright free. You can use these illustrations in your crafts & collages or scan them for your websites. So, if you like that old decadent Nineties style (I mean 1890, not 1990), this book is one window you can peek through."
4,good little printer for the price,"I am happy with this printer. It works great. Not a lot of bells and whistles like my last $100 printer that went belly up in two years.When I got it, the power cord was not working, but Lexmark replaced it immediately with out any fuss, so I have to give them credit for execellent customer service.I do not do a lot of printing so this will fit my needs for the price. The cartridges are surprisingly small, but that is ok because I use refill kits.~~~more than a year later:this printer is still up and running as before. I refill the cartridge with a refill kit and it is SO EASY to do. I am still very satisfied with this printer!"
4,Basic printer,"This is a fairly decent printer. If you want a basic printer, this does the job. I had this, a scanner, and all separate items, so I changed to a printer that was inclusive. I no longer need all the separate ones like this, but I still have this one and I'll give it to my nephew or someone, because for a beginner this is a good printer."
1,Worked for a couple weeks,"I got this printer because it wasn't high in price, and I only needed it to print a couple of things every once and awhile. It was working fine until it started pulling all of the paper out instead of just one. It would still print on the top sheet, but it was very frustrating. Also, the paper stand would fall down on top of the paper, thus making the paper bend. Bent paper wouldn't print correctly through the printer, so I had to throw them all away.Not a quality printer even for simple jobs. Not recommended."
2,"Confusing software, annoying verbal notices.","Decent enough printing on photos, but it is very confusing to use when using more than one printer. I use an old Cannon BJC-2000 for black printing, because of the huge cartridge (BC-20), and ease of refilling it.The cartridges that come with the Lexmark Z515 (16 & 26) won't print a lot, so even though the printer is inexpensive, you will have to shell out some real dough to keep it in ink."
4,Not what I expected but very good none-the-less.,"Howe's talent is truly showcased. While I thought it would be more electric-guitar based, Howe' s acoustic work on this album is amazing. One can definetly hear Chet Atkins' influences on Steve on this album. Check it out!"
3,"Super cute for ""little"" feet!","I ordered these shoes for my 5-yr old daughter who is to be Ariel for Halloween this year. She has size 1 feet. They arrived quickly via Prime. They are super cute and look like they will hold up well. However, they were way too small for her. She couldn't even get her toes through to the end. Her heel hung about 1"" off the end. I have a shoe sizer at home and measured the shoe from heel to toe, it came up as a size 13. So I would say this would fit any foot under a size 12."
5,Not what the picture shows,"These shoes do not have the feathers as pictured, but they are cute and VERY durable for play shoes. I have 4 and 5 year old girls and they play with these shoes almost every day. Other play shoes have broken sometimes as soon as the first day, but these have lasted great for 3 months so far. My 4 year old is a huge mermaid fan so that was a winning atribute too."
4,Ariel shoes,"These are super cute! The only thing I would say is if you do order them, order a half size up if available. Much smaller than expected, she will barely get a few months out of them before she grows out of them."
4,Little Mermaid Dress-Up Shoes,I bought these as a gift for my neice and she absolutely loves them! She is 4 years old and had wanted shoes with heels. These were perfect because they are durable and safe for children. I would definitely purchase from this retailer again- shipping was very quick!
3,Perfect Princess Gear,"I purchased these for my 5yr old daughter and they fit fine, even had some room for growth. They match her Ariel costume perfectly. The only downside is that the little decorations on the toe area are not very durable -- fell off during first wearing around the house. Overall, would still buy again though because of low price."
1,disappointed,"Given the raving reviews I couldn't wait to get my hands on this book after waiting for it for over a month! It took me less than 5 minutes to leaf through it - what a disappointment. Expecting outstanding photographs, they are mediocre, bland, uninteresting subjects. What are the subjects? Hoping to find breakthroughs in lighting, subject treatment or composition, I wonder why certain areas are overexposed and bothersome to look at in the photographs. Nothing stands out as innovative. I'm amazed people praise him as being so much better than Ansel Adams. It is undeniable that Ansel Adams' work is more esthetic, dramatic, fascinating and of a quality far beyond this. I'm sending it back."
2,Not Again...,To be honest i would not buy this item again. It looks cheap and it feels cheap as well. This is a good example of buying something online that appears to be the perfect item. Unfortunately appearances are decieving sometimes.This item might be pretty neat for a younger person although? It just doesnt have a professional/adult look to it.
3,Meh,"Not as funny as I'd hoped. Frumkes is a wit, but he wears thin; after a while, absurd and funny gives way to absurd and tedious."
3,The Other White Meat,"At last, recipes for the Mensan! The recipe chapter is an expansion of the idea set forth in A Modest Proposal by Jonathan Swift, but without the political bite.The rest of the book is composed of Mr. Frumkes forays into the urban jungle. They tend to be breezy and long-winded, with very little substance. The observations in the book are good for a giggle, but don't expect a glimpse of the deeper ironies - there weren't any real belly laughs in this book.If you are in Mensa, this book belongs on your shelf. However, if you are looking for some meaty humor, you likely won't find it here."
1,Bootleg--and a stupid expensive one at that,"This is totally a bootleg, and it's ridiculously expensive. Just buy the official boxsets. If you really want to buy a bootleg and get bad quality picture and subtitles, and support shady businesses, you should spend about $5 on it. $70 for a bootleg is laughable."
1,Worst Reproduction,"I just read the Reviews on this product, and most of them were right! I just recently got back from Iraq and I know for a fact this a bootleg, and it was a lot cheaper than this, about five dollars for the bootleg. It is the same design on it as the same ""Complete Collection"" as the the ones in Iraq. If you want a good copy of Rurouni Kenshin buy the box sets, or the volumes. Like the the price shows, you get what you pay for."
1,"I own the real complete collection, and this isn't it!","I hope no one get's burned on here, or buys this thing because this is not the real complete collection. The one I have are 2 fold out CD cases with something like 6 CD's per case. This is boot legged bull crap.Wait, I just found out the one I got is a bootleg too! what the heck is going on!"
1,ILLEGAL BOOTLEG,"This product is a BOOTLEG. If your going to watch this show illegally just do it online, but DONT THINK THIS IS LEGIT. This very box set was one of my first anime purchases years ago, imagine my disappointment years later when I realized I had a bootleg!To check what is legitimate and what is not go to animenewsnetwork and look under releases in the anime encyclopedia! Amazon can be trusted when you buy from them directly, NOT THE MARKETPLACE."
3,rurouni kenshin not official release,"This version is a bootlege copy, medium quality picture. It contains the ova movies, only two movies. If you want better quality buy the orginal usa version box sets. IF you are looking for a cheep version of Kenshin. I suppose this is it. But you'll love the show. So Buy the American Release. That version is higher quality and looks good. Now if only they would place it on blue ray."
3,Bootleg but awesome,"Ok first off this is a bootleg done by the Fx company( i believe thats what its called theres a little Fx on my dvds) If indeed this is the same set (I got mine as a gift the giver not knowing this was a bootleg) Anyway the quality of the picture and sound is perfectly fine. The dvds include outtakes from the English voice Dubs( which are pretty funny) the subtitles are fine too. This is exactly as i remember it when it was on Cartoon network (80 years ago so take that with a grain of salt) I have never seen the ""Official"" dvds so i cant outright compare, but as an owner of a metric ton of anime i can safely say that this set is fantastic. IF you want the Official versions go ahead and buy them, but if your are strapped for cash this one is your best bet. IF you dont mind owning a KO version. I give this 3 stars because its not legitimate even though i dare you to find the difference between the two besides packaging (and price)"
5,Thank you.,Thank you. I will enjoy it. Took a little time to get to me but very happy. When I opened it it was on good condition. Answered all my questions.
5,Kenshin,"OK, for starters, this dvd collection is obviously a bootleg. I dont mean obvious as in quality, it's just that there is no FBI warning. Aside from that, this dvd collection is only a small step below the official release. If you want to pay an extra hundred dollars or so for that little bit of quality, you should go buy the official release of all three seasons. If, however, you are like me, and just want to see the show, get this. The only downside is the disks are shipped in a VERY cheap dvd case, so you might want some sort of dvd storage (ie. dvd cases, dvd folder, dvd binder, etc.) that will hold 12 dvds."
5,Bolero Gypsies is excellent,I bought over a dozen CD's from Amazon and immediately loaded them on my iPod and have been playing them often. Excellent musician and the recordings are clear and precise.
3,Mexican Train,"A little disapointed, the original Mexican train set in the aluminum case had the nice 3/8"" thick dominoes that stood on edge well (important part of playing the game) this one has everything else the same but comes with the thin 1/4"" dominoes that can fall over easy. My fault for not asking and assuming it was original(there was no size spec. in the add) but still a little ??? on there part."
3,Not Jumbo Sized,"One reviewer had stated that these dominoes were only 1/4"" thick, and fell over easily, however the description says ""jumbo"" sized so I thought I'd take a chance that the reviewer was wrong. Nope, they are 1/4"" thick. I'm returning them. Officially, Jumbo size means 3/8"" thick. The case they come in is really nice, wish I could say the same for the dominoes."
5,Great little game,"The storage tin is sturdy and the clasp works well. The dominoes are clearly marked and in colors. The train hub plays an engine sound and whistle and seems to be fairly sturdy. The score pad was a little thin but I had purchased an extra pad from another company and it works well. I also ordered additional train markers as it seems we are always short and have to use other items. Overall, good quality game."
4,Really good game,Over the years we have found very few games that are good for the whole family - from kids to adults. Mexican train game is easy enough for the younger ones but interesting enough for adults. This particular version has large dominos in a sturdy metal case and we thought it smart to spend a few extra dollars because this game feels like a classic.
4,Nice toy,"Okay, I actually bought this for my friend who really enjoys it.I received the same toy as a Christmas gift from last year andfriends who came to our house like to play with it. So this friendcame to my house and played it and thought that oh, maybe I canget one too, so that those people who go to his house can playwith it too.So, yeah, this is really a nice toy which you can play with yourfriends while catching up with each other."
4,Great game for everyone,From older grandparents down to 8 year olds in our family have fun with this game. We have had this for a year and enjoy playing this at get togethers.
2,"Wish I'd believed the other, low reviews","As another reviewed mentioned, the quality of this product is lacking. Though all of the dominoes were included in my set, several had marks ranging from dirt to paint to... not sure, maybe dirty water that dried. I was able to get most of this cleaned off after trying a few products (nail polish remover worked best). However, a few of the marks didn't come off, and some of the dominoes had knicks that obviously couldn't be removed. If you don't play this game often, or if it's used mainly by young children, perhaps this wouldn't be an issue. But my family is full of dominoes ""sharks,"" and they will notice the knicks and stains as fast as a pro poker player spots marked cards. It ruins the fun when you know which dominoes are where. I'm really bummed. I was looking forward to playing this weekend, but alas, this is going back. I'm going to give the $35 set a try. If it's of high quality, it will be worth it."
1,Hub broken when it arrived! Had to send back for a refund :-(,"Looks like this would have been a fun game to play, except that I never got the chance. When I opened the tin box, the hub was broken into 4 pieces, and the dominoes were out of their plastic packaging. Maybe I received someone else's return? Not sure, but I am certainly disappointed."
3,Great Game,This is a great game that comes in a very sturdy case. My only complaint is there is nothing to keep the trains from falling off the platform which is very annoying after a while. I would recommend a different brand that has little slots to keep the train on the platform.
3,Mexican Train Dominos,The vendor provided great service in processing the order and rapid shipping.The aluminum case needs dividers to keep the dominos and other components separated and in order.
2,arrived broken,The centerpiece of the game was damaged. Had to send back. The second one ordered arrived damaged too. Had to order a third time.
5,Fun Game,"Fun game in a good storage box-- kids and adults enjoy playing this game, nice to have games that are not all electronic."
1,dominoes,Also bought a double 12 set that said jumbo - wrong - was the thin type - returned and did get credit - have not been able to find the 3/8 inch thick ones - wrote cardinal but no answer - the thin 1/4 inch are useless for Mexican train dominoes
4,Nice,Compact case for my RV which keeps it all in one place. The train station came broken but was replaced immediately.
5,domino game,bought this game for myself and have enjoyed it so much have also bought it for a couple of friends. nice sturdy little case & travels well
5,"MUD! I WOULDN'T say a little mud, more like a landfill!","An up lifting album for any mood. the Divne is an expert at making your soul feel sensational.this one of my 9 Miss m cds and I love it.Its vaulgar,dirty,and most of all full of jokes.Its wornderful however not ment for children I'd say under 10 . they wouldn't get it any way.she uses all her talents in this thrilling album .I tell you I have had ""mud"" for 3 years and the jokes never get old.All us Bette fans love it !"
5,"Bette Midler, my absolute favorite comic stage-nut!","This is my fourth CD of the ""Divine"" as she is called. And I shall have a ball listening to her comics amd crazy interpretations. I enjoyed her ""For the boys"" so very much. This one should be something like another onstage maddness, a delirious, rambling, raving and stark-mad performance. She too is great with the ballads she sings, a very tender and trembling voice sometimes. It just depends on the mood and circumstance. She is my beloved mermaid (I have her autobiography) and I wish I could give her a hand when she makes the crowd absolutely wild. I'd play the ""It ain't so much a question of not knowing what to do"" girl. Sorry, if I wander off in fantasy!"
4,Mud Will Be Flung Tonight,"Fun and Raunchy Bette!!!! Along with her magnificent singing, Bette Midler is a great commedienne."
2,How low can you go,"This stand brings the 2-quart bowls 1"" off the floor. It's not what I need or thought it was. The photo makes it appear higher. Upon further review, the measurements in the description are correct: 18""L x 9""W x 4""H. Oh well..."
4,Almost Perfect.,"Was looking to buy a second water bowl for my 2 kitties when I came across these bowls. I like the idea of having elevated bowls. Used to have a nice set up for my late Rottweiler. So when I saw these I was very happy. Perfect size for my 2 cats and very easy to clean. I love that they are stainless steel. I heard that plastic bowls can give cats acne or skin problems, so I always steer clear of plastic items. I would have given these 5 stars except I feel the the legs of the bowl holder could have been a little longer to provide a little more elevation. The legs were a little wobbly as well, but I just fiddled with the rubber tips and bent the legs in a little and it solved that problem. I wish I had seen these when I first bought my cats their other bowls. Spent way too much on the other bowls compared to the two sets of these I bought. Over all they are good bowls at a good price."
5,Love this collection!,My dad gave me this book when I was a teenager and I loaned it to someone who never returned it. I finally replaced it and with the original cover too! There are some really unusual stories and a few common ones. If you like vamp stuff you will love this book!
5,This book has it all !,"A very worth-while compilation of landmark short stories and excerpts from novels. This book is a note-worthy introduction to vampire fiction from its written origins. I can't recommend this book enough as the perfect ""starter"" book for the vampire fiction enthusiast. ""The Penguin Book of Vampire Stories"" will inspire any reader to build a vampire fiction library ! There is also an invaluable bonus, the back of the book lists notable vampire fiction and movies. Terrific for those who want to discover more."
5,The Essential Book of Vampires,"With stories dating from 1816 (Lord Byron's ""Fragment of a Novel"") to 1984 (Tanith Lee's ""Bite-Me-Not...""), this anthology has everything a vampire lover could want. Not only are the stories all top-notch, but the introductory notes for each story by Alan Ryan are fascinating glimpses into the ever-changing mythos of vampire lore. There are too many highlights to mention, but the sublime thrills of ""The Drifting Snow"" by August Derleth and ""Drink My Blood"" by horror master Richard Matheson are guaranteed to give you shivers."
4,A good resource,"Explained the methods thoroughly with quite a few examples. Not as good as ""Taking Charge of your Fertility"" by Weschler though, that one was much better. It was a good supplement to Taking Charge of Your Fertility (TCOYF), explaining things a little quicker and in less information than TCOYF. There were also a lot of chapters comparing the benefits of natural versus hormonal birth control."
3,Book review,"This book is good, but be careful with the natural planning method...it is still very risky. For more information, see my blog: Women's Health Daily at [...]."
3,"Informative, but tough to get through","This book had a lot of information, but nothing different/new than what I read in other books on the subject. There were no pictures or sample charts to view, so if not for having other books on hand to reference I don't think I would be able to successfully track my fertility. This book would be best used to supplement another fertility awareness book. I would reccomend ""Taking Charge of Your Fertility"" by Toni Weschler"
4,This collection is from Atlantic and covers 1962-67...,"This collection is from Atlantic and covers 1962-67. Their is another collection from Fantasy that covers everything after this but I need to get the anthology from Rhino that combines both. In the meantime this makes great background music while you are cooking dinner, reading, working, getting laid, etc. There is sort of a sameness to most of their songs but it's a good sameness. ""Green Onions"" (along with Peter Gunn's Theme) are probably the coolest instrumentals ever."
4,Good starting point,"This is a good and very general guide book for things to do in the Pacific Northwest. Its got some good information on the more famous locations (Columbia River, Mt Rainier, Mt St Helens....etc) but if you are planning on doing more in dept things, this book is not for you. Perhaps this book is more appropriate for people who are going to be in the area for a relatively short period of time and just want to hit the highlights."
3,"Thoughtful as always, but wrong this time","As always, the incredible prolific philosopher Rescher writes thoughtfully and well about an important topic. I have enjoyed several of his previous books. On this particular topic, however, I happen to have know of a large decision-theory literature on the irrationality of ""agreeing to disagree"" which suggests that Rescher is just wrong. While Rescher says that the variety of human circumstances implies that we must inevitability draw diverse conclusions, the agreeing-to-disagree literature shows how disagreement must disappear once one takes full account of the information implicit in the opinions of others. In 1976, for example, Aumann first showed this (in the Annals of Statistics) for Bayesians with common priors. Of course Rescher might reasonably disagree with this literature, but his book suggests that he is just completely unaware of it."
5,Beautiful fragrance,"If you're looking for a Diptyque-quality scent without the Diptyque price, Bob's your uncle. This long-lasting and room-filling scent is very fresh and natural."
4,Fabulous,"Let's face it - the perfect high chair pad would have no ""nooks & crannies"" and wouldn't let anything fall underneath the pad. Since this doesn't exist, this is pretty close. My Graco high chair is almost 7 years old and on my third child. It was perfectly fine except for the pad. This doesn't fit perfectly over the wide top/back of the chair but it's definitely not coming off. It's really got minimal nooks for crumbs to lodge into and it's so incredibly easy to wipe clean. Highly recommend this pad to replace those that are cracking or hard-to-clean cloth (it's a cushioned microfiber-type material)."
3,A mommy of one,"I agree that the pad is much too slippery - my 6 month old has such a difficult time staying upright that it makes feeding time very uncomfortable for him.I do give it three stars though for durability, looks and ease of clean up."
5,Rachel,"JUST WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR! I purchased the Baby Trend ""Trend"" highchair, which seemed to have all the features of the more expensive highchairs for a lot less $$. I loved the chair but HATED the cloth cover up. It was difficult to clean, and started looking old after only a few washings. This vinyl cover works perfectly! It looks nice (even though it's vinyl - it doesn't look ""cheap""). It fits my Trend high chair nicely (it looks like it came with the chair). You can easily wipe off spills; therefore, you only need to put it in the washing machine occassionally (versus 2x per week w/ the cloth ones). I don't know why they even make the cloth covers!! This is a definitely must have! This is my first time to ever write a review for a product...so that tells you how happy I am with this purchase! :)"
3,Great - but NO STRAPS,"The whole reason I purchased this pad was to use with a wooden highchair, handed down through my family. I was disappointed to find that there are NO SAFETY STRAPS included with the pad. My 5 month old cannot sit yet unassisted, so she must be strapped in. Do not buy this product if this is your intended use. I ended up buying the Reclining 4-Stage Feeding Seat by The First Years and use the Nojo navy pad with it instead of the cotton pad that it comes with."
5,Enlightening,"This book helped open my eyes to THE essence of math (creative, discovery of truth, usability) which I didn't learn through years of college (and high school) mathematics.Though I feel I've missed the boat through formal education, I finally get to see the light.What a wonderful world, math and all."
5,Great book on the Concepts of Modern Mathematics,"This book deservers to be in everyone's collection. Taking classes in my undergrad program did not answer fully the concepts of modern mathematics, which a residue of questions were hanging in my mind. This book explains concepts on topics as functions and set theory so easily, it can be explain to a child. Unlike most College course books, this book does not try to impress you with huge calculations or abstractions, but leaves the reader loving Math more and more."
1,cruddy,"dissapointed with this one , I expected to see some really quality illustrations, instead it looks like someone has got some really old comics and scanned them into this book right down to the newspaper style dots, I guess I didnt read the description properly before I bought this book, to me it is really a breif historical account in pictures using old comics, I dont know it might appeal to the purist comic freak, but I didn't like it. BEtter off relegated to being a paper weight or door stop nothing ground breaking in this, a boring book."
5,"Excellent, a must read for anyone in the business world.","I am not a manager in the healthcare industry. However, I work in office support in the healthcare industry. Ms. Robinson-Walker's book was a tremendous inspiration to me during a difficult time. I found that I was enlightened and educated by the material addressed. I particularly liked the personal stories. This book also validated that the problems were not me, but the system.I recommend this book not only for managers but for anyone who works in a business environment. From the mailroom clerk to the CEO.Thank you so much."
4,Up to 24in wide!,"I have been using this printer for over a year in my office with a 24 inch roll attached to it.I am not able to print correctly over the network, so i always have to print locally. No problems when printing locally though.The printer works great. I use if for CAD printing."
4,Cool Game,This was the game I bought with my GBA. It is alright.Graphics:7-10 The graphics are okay but they can be better. The monsters are animated from a one view (which isn't all that good).Gameplay:8-10 The gameplay can be boring at times. To me the most eciting parts are just creating monsters and battling in the cups and tournements. At the ranch all you do is train. The most exciting part at the ranch is when mail comes.The Monsters:10-10 They are really cool. You create them using any word. They become very loyal. There are quite a few different monsters.All Together:10-10 The game is pretty good. Music can get annoying. I recommend this game to new buyers.
4,Portable Monster Rancher,I loved the first three Monster Rancher so I imported the game boy advance version from Japan. Its still as sweet as ever. It's basicly the same old fun but they had to take of some stuff. That doesn't mean it's bad. It's really good. My ONLY problem was slightly dated graphics. If you loved the other monster Ranchers then you'll love this one. Don't miss it.
1,Come on people...,I read this garbage in college. This is typical scare tactics by the right to get people to fall in line. Seriously...
1,This Book Sends The Wrong Message,"Fireman Small rushes to a house that is on fire with smoke coming out all the windows and doors. Nevertheless, there is a picture and text ""The family carry sofa, lamps, tables, and chairs out of the house."" And yet, they still manage to leave a girl child and her pet cat upstairs.What kind of message is this? Aren't you supposed to grab your family and get out of the house if there is a fire? What's all this about moving all of your furniture and leaving your kid and cat behind?"
4,Good and sturdy Case...,It is a real sturdy case with good cushioning for your camera... but it is too bulky in size....
3,Mixed impression,"Appears to be serviceable, but mediocre quality for a Sony-branded product, and for the price paid."
4,okay... happy... but Carrying Case is small,"I bought a DSC Sony camera for my wife on her birthday... it performs nicely most of the time... except it needs a tri-pod when fully zooming. I got her a case for the camera over x-mas. She likes it fine... it fits the camera perfectly... however, it provides nearly zero space for anything else. I think it can improve on this area."
5,Love this case!,Really happy with the case. It is lightweight and side pocket is perfect for extra batteries.
2,"Case fits well, but looks HUGE..!!!","I always buy reading at reviews first and this time the reviews didn't help me good enough. The reason is that while the camera fits really well, the case looks huge. I know the DSCH1 is big, but the case makes it look even bigger. I returned it the same day I got it and went to Circuit City and bought a case logic case which costs way less and it is much smaller than the Sony case.Now, to be fair to the readers I have to say if you don't care about size and are looking a case that fits well your camera and at the same time protects it. Then, this is the one. But if you are looking for something that protects your camera and fits well, but at the same time doesn't add more bulk then you are not going to like this HUGE case."
5,Perfect fit!,I have a Sony H5 and I wanted to keep the lens shield on when I stored the camera. This case is a perfect fit. It supports the camera body while having one side of the case designed to accomodate the lens and shield. No generic case would be as tight and secure.p.s. I took off the case strap and just use the strap on my camera which sticks out when the camera is in the bag.
5,Sony Camera Carrying Case,"After buying the camera at Best Buy, I started to look for a carrying case. After searching through Amazon, I found the case I wanted and the case I purchased was just right for my needs."
2,Didn't like this bag...,"I got this case for a Sony DSC-H9 but I has dissapointed... the space is very reduced, no space for any accesories, even the camera was tight with the lens hood. And worst of all, it didn't have a hand carring strap."
1,Sony Camera Case dsc-h2,"I think this bag is too big,bulky, Through the Camera fits in it well.I don't like the way it closes, you need two hands to close it,Pain! You have to push the camera strap in the bag, not much room to do so, Or you will have two sets of straps outside of the bag, Messy.I'm going to keep looking for a new camera case, and sell this one cheap on the auction site............."
1,Absoloutely Terrible,"I *had* to buy this book for a class...only to find out that our instructor stopped using it after the first month of class.I am a graduate student, and as such consider myself to be well grounded in mechanics and structural analysis. In fact, I have taken 3 undergraduate level structural analysis classes and 1 graduate level analysis class - I found this textbook to be nearly impossible to read. It is terrible, and it makes simple concepts impossibly difficult to understand. I feel that this is the worst textbook I have ever read in my life.If you are looking for a good book on structural analysis, go with Hibbeler's ""Structural Analysis"". It is an excellent reference book and I use it constantly."
3,Clever. Very Clever,"Tarantino has picked up a metaphorical batton where Scorcese left, and used stimulating dialogue and complex storyline, with a feel good vibe at the end with a post sex 'Wow! That was great'. Tarantino's obsession with making crime more stimulating through black culture and drugs helped move this moveie along. Keitel was great, Roth was good. Not as great as Pulp Fiction, but you can see the stems of his talent in this movie, better than in True Romance."
1,Worst noise canceling headset I've ever used,"I had a 10 year old Plantronics headset that I needed to replace. The older set was a simple no frills model, but worked flawlessly. The P251 noise canceling headset has to be one of the worst headsets ever invented. The noise canceling function makes your voice clip in and out while talking and the sound quality that your listener hears is scratchy and chopped. I would never by these again. I had though that maybe Plantronics had made a good entry level pair of noise canceling headsets, but it was not to be."
3,Not as Bad a Book as You Think,"From the reviews seen here, one would think that Greger's book is a complete dog; but it's not that bad. One thing that Greger does well is his description of the ships of the minor naval powers such as the Austro-Hungarian and South American navies. It seems as if there is more of an emphasis on German ships, which is refreshing as there is not as much information on the Imperial German navy and Kriegsmarine as there should be. Also interesting are the drawings of the projected Soviet dreadnoughts.A pretty good effort, definitely on a par with anything written by M. J.Whitley, and in some respects better than Whitley's latest effort on battleships. Don't write this one off completely!"
2,A Disappointing Rehash,"I ordered this book sight unseen and paid the price. I was disappointed because the book offers very little in the way of new information other than repackaging: you can view all WW1 battleships in one place, then move to WW2 section and find all the ships that fought in that conflict; thus ship classes will appear in more than one place. But the line drawings were very disappointing and shaded in to boot. I could not recommend this book unless you are a relative newcomer to the field. All the World's Battleships Ed. by Ian Sturton of Conway Classics is much better value for the money."
2,Sacred Threshold : Crossing the Inner Barrier to A Deeper Lo,"I purchased this book because I had so enjoyed the workshop Paula D'Arcy gave at a Religious Education Congress. I was disappointed in the book. In her opening she speaks of her second husband being abusive--verbally, emotionally, and mentally. How unfair to rip open a past relationship and expose another's behavior. When this is done the exposed person is put on trial and convicted by the injured party without recourse."
5,Classic,"What is there to say? The film is brilliant, soaring above merely perfect Holywood to come as close as one can to the great American tragedy. Superb performances by everyone. Why spoil it for you with details; just watch it and be overwhelmed."
2,"Buyer beware.. it's in fullscreen, not widescreen!","Why is this classic shown here in the cheap/fullscreen format & not the widescreen it was originally filmed in? I say, buyer beware... hold out, until they release it in it's full format. Let's hope that is soon!"
5,Works Great for the Price,"I bought this Item a few weeks ago, about the same time my Sister bought a much more costly one.She found her 200.00 dollar Item held very little liquid but worked fine otherwise. Mine worked fine also plus held twice the liquid for one third the cost. Gotta love that...."
3,Processor by Hamilton Beach,"This is a ""okay"" processor.. noisy but does the job for a reasonable price.At some point, I'll switch over to Kitchenaide whenever they, too, go to BPA free containers."
3,Meh.,It's really hard to shred veggies. I tried shredding cabbage and carrots but my cabbage turned into itty bitty mushy pieces and the last chunks of my carrots weren't shredded and fell into a gap without getting processed. I can already see the S blades starting to get chipped.. Not really all that high quality.
4,Second One,"Received mine last night, was waiting patiently and I needed it right away. I shredded zucchini from garden overload last night. I am a minimalist but this is an item that I feel I needed. When I was missing a food processor, I tried by hand and what a pain. I did have an older processor that I used all the time, not the same brand. I had for ten years and it did not hold as much, but I liked it. This one performed better and I am happy with it the first time. It was quieter, holds more and did not move around on the counter, when shredding, like my old one did. After I used it for shredding zucchini to make zucchini cake, I used it to make coleslaw and it performed great! The processor was so easy to use that I did not need instructions. Keep in mind that this was the first time I had used it. I feel like I made a good purchase.Two months later: I am still happy with this purchase and use it a lot."
5,Love this!,I bought this as a replacement for another hamilton beach food processor that my sister got as a wedding present 20 years ago. She uses it all of the time and we really hope this one lasts as long as the last one!
2,Poor construction,"I really wanted to like this, but the shredding blade was poorly designed - a piece of metal sandwiched between two little pieces of plastic. It stripped when I was grating green tomatoes for relish, less than a week after I purchased it. It also smelled like the motor was burning, so I returned it. I gave it two stars rather than one because they were very easy to deal with on the return."
4,foodprocessor,"Not too bad for a low end processor. Lots of power. Bowl takes some getting used to on and off locking. Plastic bowl vice glass, but does all we need it to do."
5,excellent processor!,"I purchased this after reading numerous reviews. Given the fact that I didn't want to spend $200, this was the perfect choice. I have loved this food processor. I just made 30 jars of pesto. It worked great, and has for numerous other things as well. I have friends with food processors that cost $200-$300 and this one is every bit as good."
5,Excellent,"This will grate cheese, slice cheese, puree stuff, not-quite-puree stuff. It is easy to take apart and put back together for cleaning. It was also a lot cheaper than some of the less functional food processors out there."
5,"""Bonnie""","I am very satisfied with the food processor. Works great, made salads for our salad luncheon at church and it cut the time of preparing salads. I would say it was a very good purchase for me. As I have never had a food processor before I don't have one to compare it to. It was also nice too having it delivered right to my door."
1,Unable to use blade system,"The grater and the blade system quit working, it's useless without being able to use the blades system, I would not buy another"
1,not a good buy,"The work bowl was difficult to seat on the machine. Really difficult. Same problem with the lid after putting on the blade. Worse, as soon as I grated a carrot, the bottom nut on the blade came off. Smoke came out. I would not recommend this product to anyone. Spend the money and get a cuisinart."
1,Never worked,"This one was recommended in a 2011 Taste of Home magazine. As I'd worn out my aged Cuisinart, I decided to buy a low cost food processor for the occasional use, as I no longer am cooking for a large family. The first time I tried to use this, it did not engage or work. Of course the bowl was full of something messy! I took the bowl, blades and top apart, then cleaned them and dug out the directions. I'd put it all together correctly but it still didn't work empty. Disgusted, I consigned it to the garage and ordered a different one. Figure I can't return it as I'd tossed out the box and packing material. Bought a KitchenAid locally and it works every time."
2,Broken main shaft,"I loved how this food processor worked, while it worked. After about a year the main shaft (plastic, of course) just broke while I was grating cheese. Unfortunately this is not repairable, so the entire unit is useless. I would never buy another one because it's just too cheaply made. I would have given it one star, which it probably deserves, but I was happy with it while it worked.We used it sparingly, about once every couple of months, usually for cheese."
5,Works perfectly,"This processor is a gem. My old GE lasted for 20 years, and was still working well, but the blades would always push the food down and I would have to keep stirring to help it mix and chop. The blades on the Hamilton Beach are designed in such a way to sweep the bottom and keep all the food ""in the mix"" so to speak. Strong motor and easy clean up too! Nice addition to my ""iron chef"" attitude! HA"
4,Gift to my sister and she loves it!,My sister loves using her new Hamilton Beach 70670 Food Processor. It's does everything she needs it to do and the price was very right also.
5,money saver,"I wanted something that would shred cheese, chop bologna, make bread crumbs, so I could buy chunk cheese and bologna at a cheaper price than the packaged cheese and deli ham salad. It does everything I wanted it to do. thanks"
1,Don't Buy,First machine arrived used with food particles in the food cup...gross! Second one arrived in new condition but only would work when food cup was not in the locked position. Returned both.
1,Burnt out after 3 months,"I bought this based on fairly decent reviews and a great price, and it worked great for about 3 months for grating vegetables and cheese. Then the other day, it just stopped. The motor still runs but it isn't strong enough to turn the blade, and a horrible burning smell comes out of the base. This item is supposedly under warranty for a year, but what they don't tell you is they will charge you $15 to ship a replacement. I'm failing to see why I need to pay $15 when it's not my problem their product doesn't function as it's supposed to after 3 months of appropriate use."
5,Great value,"Was a little concerned because many of the food processors were quite expensive; wasn't sure this one would meet my needs. I mostly use my food processor for making pesto and other sauces, so I don't need a really heavy-duty one, but it still has to be strong. I previouly had a Hamilton Beach food processor and was happy with it, so I thought I'd try another one. I'm happy to say that this one has done very well so far. It handles large quantities of leaves and grinds them up quickly, without having to stop and stir too often. I also like that you can fill the bowl with more liquid than with many other food processors. I am very pleased."
4,A Good Buy,"Sooner or later, you're gonna need a food processor. Unless you need one on a regular basis, this is probably the best one you could invest in. It works well, cleans up easily in the dishwasher, & it has little suction cups to hold it securely on the countertop while you're using it. I love it."
2,Does not puree well,"I bought this to make hummus, soups etc, not really to slice and dice. The puree feature did not work well for me; food was still grainy and thick and I could not get soups to come out smooth. Appearance wise, it looks fabulous. Easy to use as well. Just not very good on the puree feature."
5,great game,"Really fun addition to the original killer bunnies deck! I will soon be buying the next expansion pack in the series. If you haven't played these games, you must!"
3,An expansion pack to a fun card game,"This is an expansion pack to the Killer Bunnies card game. I liked the card game, but after involving all of the expansion packs, extra cards, extended rules, etc, I eventually lost interest in the game. I'd say the game was much more fun before all of the complicated extras... when it was a quick and simple way to waste time with friends."
4,Kinda fun,"This ""red booster pack"" is an extension to the Killer Bunnies game. You'll need the base game (blue) and the yellow extension pack to play, and that base game is awsome -- it is the only game I've played that encourages players making deals, and this adds a whole new dimension of fun. I've mixed feelings on the red cards. Some are really fun (like the red bunnies), some are really complicated without adding much to the game (like the Weapons Emporium -- there's seldom enough money to buy them anyway), and some are too deadly. However, it is easy enough to sort through the deck, and pick out the ones you want to use. Look, they are all fun and funny cards; I'm just reminding you that Killer Bunnies is all about negotiation -- so, negotiate which cards you want to use. The extra carrot cards extend the durration of the average game somewhat."
5,FUN!,This is a great add-on to the original set. Makes everything much more exciting/fun. Would highly recommend this to those who really enjoyed the original pack.
2,not too sturdy,"I bought this for my twins fourth birthday. They love playing with Barbies and I thought this would be great for them. And I was right; they love it. I, however, think it was too expensive for the quality. Very flimsy and unsturdy. I might not have been so disappointed if it was about half the price."
5,Fun!,"I purchased two of these dream homes in the lighter color version about 2 years ago and my two daughters are still playing with their houses. So far they have held up very well. My daughters are older girls and they tend to take care of their toys very well. My only complaint would be storage, there isn't any sufficient storage space and my girls complained about the inability to use all of the kitchen drawers to store plates and cups. I found this odd also because the drawers are there varying in different sizes, but only the small one is made to open and close. Sometimes the windows will pop out if the girls are moving the houses to different areas of the house, but they're are easy to pop back into place. This is a beautiful house, the lighter pink is more attractive than the new darker pink version. In my opinion, the darker pink is just to much, they should have kept the original color."
3,everything falls off!,"My daughters (4 and 6 yo) love playing with their Barbie house that Santa brought them for Christmas but.... almost immediately the window panes, doors, and flower box fell off as well as various parts of the roof. I tried gluing the roof parts and the flower box back on with a good craft glue but didn't work. The girls still love it and play with it constantly but without window panes, doors, flower box, and roof parts. I remember having a Barbie Dream House when I was a child. It was orange, made of painted wood and plastic, didn't have all the bells and whistles this one does BUT the parts didn't fall apart. I gave this a 3 because even though the girls love to play with it, I feel strongly that for the amount of money I, er, I mean, Santa paid for it, the house should STAY TOGETHER!!!"
3,The good and the bad of the dream house,"My girls (ages 2 & 4) received the Dream House for Christmas. Both love to play with it, though it does have many small pieces that I have to hide from my 2 yr old. While they have not been disappointed, I must say the construction of the house is flimsy at best. The windows do pop out as mentioned in other reviews; I ended up just taking them out instead of fighting to glue them in. If I was to purchase again, I would probably take a look at the new Barbie ""rooms"" instead of the large, poorly made dream house."
4,Barbie Dream House,"Great doll house for Amazon's price ($80). My three year old just got this for Christmas, and it was the only present she wanted to play with. She did not care to open anything else after this. It has sounds for the doorbell, toilet and radio. The spiral staircase also has a post to hold the doll, then transports the doll upstairs. I think it is the best 12"" doll house I've seen."
5,best toy for a girl,This house is perfect. You get a lot of small things that you did' ent think you would get. If you are looking for an overwelming gift - a house as high as a 5 year old. This is the gift. My daugther asked why she had this she could not belives that it was for her.
4,Got what I was looking for,"I was looking for a sturdy doll house that was not too complicated to put together. Mission accomplished. My only complaint is that alot of the furnishings that come with it are very little pieces. So if you have infants, small toddlers that like to put things in their mouth, be careful."
5,Reliable Barbie,This Dream House was a huge hit at our house. My 6 year old daughter just loves it! It is easy to assemble and it folds up nicely for storing. At the same time we purchased a Bratz Winter Lodge for our older daughter and there is no comparison. The Barbie house is of much higher quality and more interesting to play with. Well done!
4,BARBIE 3 STORY DREAM H OUSE PLAYSET,"I BOUGHT IT FOR MY DAUGHTER FOR CHRISTMAS. PUTTING IT TOGETHER WAS A NIGHTMARE! THE DIRECTIONS ARE HORRIBLE.. WE CAN STILL NOT GET THE TOILET TO FLUSH OR FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE THE MUSIC THROUGH THE INTERCOM WORK. FOR $100, THE DIRECTIONS SHOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER AND EASIER TO UNDERSTAND. MY DAUGHTER DOES ENJOY PLAYING WITH IT AND DOES NOT KNOW THAT THE MUSIC IS SUPPOSED TO PLAY."
5,wonderful,This product was very easy to put together. Our 3 year old grandaughter just absolutely loves it. The only thing I was disappointed with it doesn't have as much furniture as the other doll houses I have purchased in the past.
3,Potty doesn't make flushing sound,"I bought 2 houses. They were not shipped in outer protective box and the surprise would have been ruined if I hadn't found them first...at the back door. Glad it didn't rain. The grandkids like them, but the potty in one doesn't work. It's hard to explain why Santa brings defective toys."
2,Disappointing,"I am very disappointed in the quality and durablity of this toy. My 6 yr old daughter went from excited to disappointed within an hour when it started falling apart when she played with it. Some items were impossible to assemble, and many fell apart even after assembling according to directions. I would not recommend this."
4,Great toy!,"This dollhouse is everything I wanted. My niece really like it, she's been playing with it for over 2 weeks now and it hasn't broke or anything else. Looks flimsy but I think it depends on the child that plays with it."
4,Potential for lots of fun,"I got my 7 year old the dream house as her big Christmas present and though she screamed (happily) when she opened it, she has not played with it as often as I'd hoped. It has lots of small pieces and cool features and my two younger kids (2 and 4) love to sneak in her room and play with it.My biggest issue with this toy is that it was sent in it's original box. I had read other's peoples reviews and knew to be careful. Thank goodness I kept my eye on the street, for as soon as the UPS guy showed up, I kept the kids in one room while my husband ran out and put it in the attic. That would have been a disaster - as the box is HUGE and there are pictures on all sides. Would it really cost that much to slap two huge stickers on it, Amazon?"
3,It is an Ok toy.,"My 7 year old daughter loves it, but I am dissapointed with how easily things fall off. Like the window frames are always coming off. And the roof attachements too. The toilet will only flush once a day and the door bell will ring only once a day too. I think it must have a malfuntion. But she never complains and that is all that matters."
4,"FUN, FUN, FUN!","My five year old enjoys this house tremendously. It is not as sturdy as I would have liked but it does not bother her a bit. She plays with this house for hours at a time. So far, so good!"
5,Every Little Girl's Dream House,"This Barbie House was everything I thought it would be and more. My 5-year old daughter is in love with it, and has not stopped playing with it since Christmas. Lots of cute ""bells and whistles"" - appliances make sounds, doorbell, music, etc. I didn't think it was too difficult to put together - maybe took a little over an hour. Worth every penny!"
4,Great Buy,"I bought this for my 5 year old niece for Christmas. She absolutely loves it. This is a great purchase for any doll-loving kid. My niece is very excited about the ""noise"" features of the house especially, such as the stove, doorbell, radio, etc. I put the house together and found the plastic to be a little flimsy, but what can you expect from a plastic doll house anyway? I would recommend this to anyone who wants to suprise and delight a child in their life."
4,My 7-year old loves it!,We purchased this dollhouse for my 7-year old daughter - mainly based on the favorable reviews from amazon.com - since it was such a big-ticket item (for us) and we didn't want to waste our money.All I can say is the reviews were right on. This is a great dollhouse. It has so many fun pieces - and was easy to put together. She spends hours a day playing with it. It's definitely worth the money.I only wish we'd bought it for her last year!
4,Every Little Girls Dream House,"This thing took me a couple of hours to put together on Christmas morning. The instructions are in about 25 different languages with vague pictures. I don't think I ever did figure out where all of the stickers were supposed to go. However, my daughter LOVES IT! So, that is what counts, right? It really is cute with a winding staircase that you can put Barbie on to go up or down the stairs, the toilet makes a flushing sound, the doorbell rings, the stove sizzles and there is an intercom that plays music. You can drop the laundry down the hamper to land in the laundry basket on top of the washer and dryer that actually spin. The top floor comes off to take with you on a trip to grandma's house. With the Amazon discounts it was well worth the money. Like I said, the kid loves it and plays with it everyday. I can't say that for toys that I have spent more money on."
4,Good product,"My 9 year old daughter loves the dream house. It was easy to assemble and will get alot of use. I think it was a little over priced, but think it is worth the hours of play time for my girl."
5,Best gift ever!,This was the gift that made Christmas for my daughter. She is 8. She has played with it almost every day since Santa brought it. It is a little girls dream.
4,Mom of 5 year old & 3 year old,"This is a very nice doll house and it is very very large. The reason that I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is:the intercom is very loud (with no volume control)the top level does not lock into place (therefore my 3 yr old could pull this down very easily)and there is nowhere to store the furniture when you close the house up.Make sure you allow at least an hour for assembly and decorating. Also, I opened this item after 30 days and realized that the taps had broken off the bathtub and I can't return it. Other than that, this house is adorable and has tons of extra pieces. I know my daughter is going to love receiving this for Christmas."
2,Not worth the money...,"We purchased this last year for my 5 year old daughter for Christmas-from Santa. My husband and I found it difficult to piece together as the pieces would just pop apart. We felt it was very cheaply made and not worth the $100 we spent. It is big and bulky and a little hard to move because it's all plastic and not sturdy. The elevator would get hung up when trying to move it up and down. The furniture pieces would also pop apart very easily. It has since moved over to Grandma's house to play with when she is over there. I would recommend going with the Loving Family house. It is made of heavy plastic, folds up nicely and does not at all seem cheap and it's about 1/2 the price of the Barbie House."
2,fun but definietly not durable,My daughter received this for christmas. The stand that holds the barbie as she supposidly glides up the stairs broke as soon as my daughter tried to put her barbie in it. The windows and doors also pop off easily. My daughter still likes to play with the toy but the tears on Christmas morning from her breaking her new toy really put a damper on things.
3,WATCH OUT! SHIPPED IN MANUF. BOX,"I haven't opened this present yet, but wanted everyone to know that it ships in the manuf. box so be careful. We drove up in my driveway yesterday and saw it sitting beside the garage. This was our Christmas present from Santa and my oldest daughter saw it before I could get her to look the other way. Now I have nothing to give them from Santa and Amazon compensated with a $20 credit. I have never received anything from Amazon in the manuf box so I wasn't expecting this to happen. Just beware if you're ordering for Christmas. -Disappointed Buyer"
2,3 story dream house - poorly manufactured,"Kids love it but it is not worth the money. Several pieces were broke and it is poorly made. I have a friend who purchased one as well and she states the same.I wanted it replaced but Amazon could only take the order not make good by replaceing it. I had no choice but to keep it damaged or I would have broken my childs heart. She wanted it so bad, we took it in pieces.Do not buy it! Spend the money on something else worth buying!!!"
3,Fun but not durable.,"My daughter got this house last Christmas. We had the same problems as the other reviews with the window frames popping out, the bed and vanity kept coming apart. I would suggest super gluing them together? I would like to find a wooden, sturdier product."
3,Children love it!,"My children love this dream house. The only problem I had with it is that the window frames will not stay in the house. They keep popping off. Other than that, great toy!"
4,Very nice,My daughter loves it. It was easy to assemble and seems pretty durable. Lots of little pieces though and not easy to move around from room to room. I suggest keeping it in one location.
4,This is a decent product for the Barbie fan in your life,"While the quality of the plastic seems a bit cheap, most Barbie items over the years have gone in this direction. The Dream House is a great toy for your Barbie fan, however.Lots of house items like plates, tables, cups, rugs, beanbag chair, and other neat knick-knacks make this a fun thing to add to your child's collection of toys. It is a nice toy with a lot of nice features. I just wish the plastic was a little heavier duty. It was easy to assemble with good instructions, and we were playing with the house in less than 45 minutes from the time the box was opened. I do not recommend this toy for a girl under the age of 7, as the parts are small, and some of the features need a bit more understanding than the average 7 year old can muster. My daughter is 10, and given her age, this toy will probably stay in fine condition for many years to come. 4 stars."
3,"a lovely house, but not durable","my daughter loves this house and she is 12 years old!!! it is beautiful and provides hours of fun, however it is not very durable. she broke a piece off the first day and her dad had to fix with glue. be very careful when assembling!!! and encourage careful play. will not withstand any rough use."
4,barbie house,The olnly complaint I have is that when it was shipped it was not wrapped in any sort of paper. So if my daughter had been home at the time she would have seen her christmas present. I thought they could have at lease covered it up.
4,Barbie 3-Story Dream House,Very neat doll house. We purchased this for our 6 year old daughter for Christmas. She wanted it more than anything else. She really loves that the toilet makes a real flushing sound. It's a very big doll house so it's well worth the $. Only problem is some of the windows don't stay snapped in. Overall it's very nice.
5,Great suprise gift,"I actually bought the Barbie 3-Story Dream House Playset as a surprise and I really appreciated the fact that it was not damage at all. And the price was very resonable. I never thought that I would ever buy anything over the interent but I was very happy with the Barbie Dream House, the service of delivery especially with Amazon providing this for me."
4,"Lots of fun, but not very durable","My 6 1/2 yr. old daughter got this for Christmas. She was sooo excited! This thing is pretty big and heavy, but it does fold up. It was fairly easy to put together. While I was trying to put the doors into place, the door knobs and the knobs that hold the doors into place broke off (not fixable), and one of the windows keeps popping out (super glue will fix this one). There were no instructions on where to put the stickers (I used the picture on the box to figure it out). On the box a little girl is pictured carrying the 3rd floor with a handle, ours does not have one. It doesn't come with a lot of furniture, it's mostly tiny pieces like forks, knives, plates, etc.Overall it is a fun toy, it's all my kids have been playing with! We also have the Barbie Townhouse which seems to be a little more durable and not that much smaller!Just beware, this does not come wrapped!"
3,Daughter loves it but it's very flimsy,My daughter told Santa she wanted this for Christmas (told 3 different Santa's to be exact) so of course she got it and fell in LOVE!!! The house comes with a lot of great stuff and it's very pretty but everything falls out or pops out. I'm afraid to move it around too much because of the windows constantly popping out but she's happy so I guess it was all worth it. I had some problems with a few broken pieces when we received it but Mattel was very helpful and is sending replacement pieces.
4,Poor/Regretted transaction,"The amazon site clearly displayed 2 colors available for the dreamhouse; however, only the hot pink version is available (the light pink version is discontinued). In addition to this oversight, the return process was frustrating. The A-Z guarantee claims rep I dealt with was rude and incompetent (his emails condescending); I will never go through that again."
5,wonderful,I bought this for our grandaughter for christmas. I believe she is going to spend many hours playing with this Barbie house and all that goes with it. Is was fun and easy to put together. Seems like they thought of everything to put in this house. I am very glad that I purchased it for her.
4,"Doll House 5 stars, Amazon.com 0 !!!","Yesterday a delivery man rang the door bell and my daughter went to the door. There she found a ""Barbie Dream House"" sitting on the porch. Instead of shipping it in a PLAIN BROWN BOX, Amazon shipped the toy as is in its own box! This is a toy that my daughter has been wanting for years. This was to be her biggest (and priciest!) gift from SANTA!This was totally inexcusable. I've been a faithful customer for years but I will never buy anything from this company again.Thanks for ruining our Christmas Amazon.com!"
3,child was happy,"I had a hard time getting everything to stay together, like the windows staying on, the decortive peices on the outside, the doors on the third floor. On the stair case the lift that carries the barbies up and down broke with in a few hours. All and All it is a cute house. I was dispointed in the product , but my daughter and her frinds like it."
2,Not too sturdy... maybe ok for big kids,"We got this for my 4-year old daughter for Christmas. The house is cute, went together well for the most part, and the electronics (doorbell, etc.) were great. My daughter loved it. Unfortunately, it didn't last very long.The doors and window frame came off too easily (eventually I superglued the windows), and some of the pieces didn't fit together well when the house was all put together, leaving the 3rd story part sagging if it wasn't just right. Naturally, a 4 year old trying to play isn't paying attention to that. After 2 months, the floor part of the second-story bathroom broke beyond repair. Because of the sharp plastic edges that were left, I finally had to throw it out. We were both sad.My little girl is very easy on toys. In my opinion, the quality of this toy is not what it should be for the price."
2,Mattel Barbie 3-Story Dream House,"My 3 year old loves this Dreamhouse. However, the electrical part of it stopped working after about 10 minutes. I tried several new batteries and nothing. Mattel made me ship back all of the tiny pieces (at my own expense) and they will be sending me a new Dreamhouse in a FEW WEEKS. (By the way, the rep. at Mattel was making me send even more of the house back but I asked for her manager and then I was told just the tiny accessories) It was very hard explaining to a 3 year old that I had to take most of the house away from her in order for them to send her a new house that works. I'm not sure why I had to pay the shipping since I only had the house for a few minutes when it stopped working... Also, the windows fall out constantly and, the doors pop out of their tracks. I find it annoying but like I said, my daughter just keeps playing with it even without all of the little accessories..."
3,Cheaply made!,"While it has an impressive look when you first see it - the quality is not that great. The plastic is thin and flimsy!! It is made to be replaced soon with another expensive Barbie house.....that being said - my granddaughter loved it and it does make some cute sounds...doorbell rings, intercom plays music, toilet flushes, etc. It has the necessary furnishings for a child to start playing with. All you need to add is a Barbie or 2. I wouldn't expect this to hold up under heavy play....must be treated with care!"
2,Barbie dream house,"The house looks amazing on the box, but after getting it all together the lay out of the rooms are very unreasonable, it looks likes this huge house but then once you start putting the furniture in it, the space is quickly taken and you have to put the furniture in awkward positions. Also the amount of furniture you receive is not enough. The entertainment space is more like a hall way, I don't know why they even bothered putting this extra on the house, it would have been better just to let that be an extra floor. The drawer space in the kitchen is awful and the refrigerator space. Also the washer and dryer spin but not if you put even 1 piece of clothing in it. Also the window frames pop out very easily. To me this house is just a bunch of hype."
5,Barbie Dream House well worth the money,"The Dream House has been a great role-playing tool for my 3 and 5 year-old girls. They've had Barbies for about 6 months, but have not really played with them until now. Now...they can't stop!The House was easily assembled with the help of my 5 year-old. It hasn't left the family room. They play with it on every rainy and home-bound day. It is a great toy and well worth the money. And with Amazon Prime, you just can't beat the shipping!!!"
5,"Great Toy, lots of fun","My 3 yr old just loves this Barbie house. SHe is forever ringing the doorbell and saying, ""Is anybody home"". SHe plays with it for HOURS."
5,Only toy to keep my energetic 4 year old attention,"This is hands down the BEST toy my child has ever received. EVERYDAY since xmas she has played with this for a minimum of two hours. I can't believe she hasn't gotten bored yet. We have let her leave it in the living room which is key. She uses it to play with her polly pockets, bratz, barbies. She loves it and I believe she'll get many more years out of this toy. By the way..my daughter is typically from toy to toy so keeping her attention has been huge!"
4,My 5 1/2 year old loves this!,"All my 5 1/2 year old daughter wanted from Santa was a dollhouse for her barbies. On Christmas morning she was ecstatic to find this under the tree. It's the only thing that she played with for the first 3 days. My husband put the house together with no trouble. As stated in other reviews, some of the plastic trim pieces come off easily - but can be put back. For the price and the happiness my daughter shows while using her imagination to act out stories w/her barbies, I'd buy it again!"
2,Cheap! Cheap! Cheap!,"Buyer Beware! i bought this ""dream"" house last christmas for my daughter, and it is anything but a dream. The window frames pop out right away and the staircase broke after a month. It's very disappointing to spend alot of money on a toy just to find that everything wants to break easily. The very top floor that detaches doesn't stay on well. Seems like it needs more support somewhere. Just be prepared for things to break easily."
1,Barbie 3-story dream house playset,This product was received broken and is cheaply made. Shipped back for refund.
2,Poor Quality,"Although pretty not very durable. Plastic is very flimsy and the doors pop out easily. Staircase broke days after getting it. I could understand if my girls were rough on toys but they are not. Just bought them the Kid Kraft doll house, much better construction, size and price."
3,In my opinion,"My wife and I bought this house for our 9 year old daughter for Christmas. It was hard to setup and she played with it for a few hours. Then we realized how rickity it was, its windows would fall off and it's impossible to get them back on. I do not recommend this Barbie house. If your looking for the perfect Christmas gift this is probably not the one to get."
5,Dream House,My daughter really loves playing with this doll house. I am really glad that we got it for her. The only problem was the delivery. It came to our house in the doll house box. This was a surprise gift for her and we were lucky that when it arrived she was not home from school and someone was able to hide it quickly.
4,Barbie 3-Story Dream House,"Santa brought my daughter the Barbie 3-Story Dream House. She was very pleased with it, but, I don't know what happened on the way to our house, but the Toilet would not make the flushing sound. Other than that, my daughter is very happy with the gift that Santa brought her."
4,Pretty Good,"I am a piano technician myself. If you are reading to get technical information for a piano, don't waste your time. If you want a life story about a wonderful man who is full of tact and can understand what people aren't telling you, this is a great book. The book is excellent until it comes to his personal religeous beliefs. If you are a born-again Christian, then you'll probably enjoy his viewpoints. It you're not, then those sections will annoy you. The book is excellent except for his rambling on about his views of Christianity. The rest of the book is priceless. You actually feel like you know him personally. You actually feel like you know the artists. His chapter about growing up in Germany is worth the price of the book alone. Please buy it and enjoy it."
5,Great book for everyone!,"_My Life With the Great Pianists_ is an excellently written,humorous, and educational book. Franz Mohr worked withHorowitz, Rubenstein, and other great pianists, serving astheir piano tuner. Here he reveals their idiosyncrysies andnervous moments. Mohr also writes about himself, telling ofthe ghastly destruction of his hometown in Germany duringWorld War II, and gives his personal testimony of the handof God in his life."
5,Another piece to the puzzle,"Franz Mohr recites memories and personal stories that only a Piano Tuner would know about such greats as Cliburn, Gilels, Rubinstein, Horowitz, and Michelangeli. Moreover, Mohr gives a behind the scenes glimpse into Horowitz's historic return to Moscow, details that can be found nowhere else."
1,. . . a disappointment,"I was expecting a book full of colorful anecdotes about piano tuning for the great artists of the past. (As a piano technician myself, I was looking forward to these.) While there are a few such stories, this book is mostly filled with the author's testament about how his life has been fulfilled by his faith in Jesus Christ. He travelled the world with Horowitz, and instead of sightseeing and telling us of his adventures he tells us of spending time in great cities sitting in his hotel room, reading his bible. Most of his anecdotes relate to trying to get the great pianists to pray with him, or to take a bible from him. The writing is stilted and drab, except for the flowery prose of his co-writer, when she writes her little tid-bits. Anyone want my copy before it goes to the trash heap?"
1,Elizabeth Small,"I was terribly disappointed in this book. I too thought it would include some interesting stories about great pianists. Instead it was a very thinnly disguised book of proselytization. It belongs in a Christian book store, not in a Steinway Gallery - where I bought the book"
3,just ok,"these containers are just ok. Things i don't like about them... they can be hard to open. Another thing that bothers me about them is they don't stack on top of each other, which would be very handy in the freezer. I do like the size of them and the colors are cool."
2,A Fifteen Word Book,"At the end of the excellent 400-page text/program ""Teach Your Child to Read in 100 Easy Lessons,"" twenty books are recommended for children who now (according to the text) read at a second-grade level. This is the third book on the list of twenty. The fourth page of this book, ""Look What I Can Do,"" has five words, ""Look what I can do!"" On page 7, there are five more words, ""I can do it too!"" The last page has the same five words as the first page, ""Look what I can do!"" In between, there are a lot of pictures. If you would like your child to read more than 15 words, you might think about getting a different book."
3,Another underated effort!,"Another underarted 80's effort by AC/DC. As you all know, no songs on this album ever make it to radio play or in there live set all that often, or not at all. From the title track to ""send for the man"" this album still has plenty of balls, basic, simple and straight to the point. Apart from the vocals being drowned out by the music (Brian Johnson is hard to understand anyway, but even more so in this instance), this ia s ripper of an album."
2,NOT CLASSIC AC/DC,"FLY ON THE WALL is not all bad, but not one of their best. The best songs are FLY ON THE WALL, the very good SHAKE YOUR FOUNDATIONS, DANGER & SINK THE PINK. The rest is rather ordinary including the awful STAND UP, FIRST BLOOD & SEND FOR THE MAN.A fair album, but not the classic AC/DC everyone expects."
5,Heavy as Hell! It's an earthquake of an album!,Fly On the Wall is a superb CD.Heavy as hell and twice as hot!When you are unhinged this is the AC/DC CD to put you into the Twilight Zone. Shake your Foundations sums it up .If Mike Tyson was an album it would be this one !
2,No good for AC/DC standards,"After 1981's FOR THOSE ABOUT TO ROCK, AC/DC began to run out of ideas at an alarming rate. They changed producer Mutt Lange, they fired Phil Rudd, every step was made to make thing better. But nothing happened. Brian Johnson's voice soon got worse compared to BACK IN BLACK standards, and new drummer Simon Wright could not fill the shoes of Phil Rudd. FLY ON THE WALL is one of the worst (if there is a bad AC/DC album!!) AC/DC albums ever, one that has not produced a standard for their live set nor got deep into fans' memories."
4,"Good, but not AC/DC material.","Come on now, it is a good album but they could've done better (and what's with using pedals guys? What happend to no pedals ever?). It does have it's classics, like Fly On The Wall, and Shake Your Foundations, but come on guys, it could have been better."
4,Lost Classic,"AC/DC rules, period! This is another typical meat and potatos metal album. You know the sound, well it's all on here, much better then the commercialized stuff on 'razors edge' or 'ballbreaker'. Get this cd and enjoy in the sound of a true metal band!"
3,"It's better than ""Flick of the Switch""","Well, it has some good songs. I particularly like ""Danger,"" Brian Johnson actually tries to sing a bit in the beginning. God, he has an awful voice. He makes Joe Stummer sound like Aretha Franklin. It has a harder edge than their last few; it has that 80's studio sound. I really wish they would give their drummer something more to do during the course of a song. They need a little bit more ""funk."" ""Sink the Pink"" is a cool song, despite the lyrics, which as ususual, never get beyond Johnson's crotch, which is where I think his tiny brain must be located. But, then again, anyone listening to AC/DC for spiritual insperation is in big trouble. The videos for this album are great. If you can find the VHS tape, I'd buy that instead."
3,not up to their usual standards,"Best song: ""Playing With Girls"". That's it. This was the last studio album of AC/DC's that I ever had.Thank goodness it was a gift."
2,Really weak,"Brian Johnson's voice was practically gone by that time. Also, the production is simply horrible here.The songwriting is good, however, and would make for a good listen, except for the problems mentioned above.The fact is that AC/DC virtually died when Bon died. The guy was simply irreplaceable. He was the missing link that finally launched the Young brothers to stardom. Due to sheer talent, their momentum was so good, the inspiration at a peak, that BACK IN BLACK would have been a success with any singer, be it Brian Johnson or another. That they managed to record album after album after Bon's death, itás a tribute to their quality."
2,THROW IT AT THE WALL,"This is the first time that Brian Johnson began to show clear signs that his voice was beginning to go... It has some good tunes, but the debut of drummer Simon Wright added nothing to the band, it just made it worse. The lyrics reached an all time low here, it makes one want to cry whn comparing them with Bon Scott's lyrics ( no wonder the YOung Brothers assumed all lyrics in the next albuns)"
3,It's Not As Bad As You Thought It Was,"So this wasn't round two of ""Back in Black""? Well, what WAS? You could do a lot worse, even by AC/DC standards, than this album, which is worth the price for ""Sink the Pink"" alone."
3,AC/DC on auto pilot....,"....that kinda goes without saying. But I'd have to say Fly On the Wall is the AC/DC album with the least brains - kinda scary! Don't get me wrong, I still love the band as much as ever. Most of the songs retread familiar ground, familiar lyrics, well... familiar everything. Johnson's voice sounds like a chainsaw cutting thru a Sequoia at this point, which I'm sure explains why it is mixed so far back. A couple of songs worth mention are; ""Shake Your Foundations,"" which was resurrected on Who Made Who in '86 and ""Back in Business,"" which sports a vintage riff wrapped around a cool solo by Angus. Nothing much more to say, if you haven't heard it, you already have, if you know what I mean."
2,Production,"Songs are O.K, but the key word here is PRODUCTION. basically there isn't any. If you want real production of ACDC at its best, Ballbreaker has some of the best in the business. Enjoy."
2,UNDERRATED.....Because it's bad !!!,"AC/DC never cared much about other people opinions, but I hope they could be a little humble to recognize the fact that this is one of their worst CD'S ever. Simon Wright didn't fit into the band, Brian Johnson started to losing any singing capability he had. It's a bad album (and I love AC/DC) . THis is the band who has sold more than 46 million copies in U.S. alone. I never expected to hear such a low quality release by them."
4,"Sink the Pink, Baby!!!!","I was first disappointed when this album was released. It took some time to grow on me. Now I've listen to this one for years and they're ""Back in Business""."
3,Mammoth fly on your wall!,"Certainly not their best work-yet it helps one to remember that AC/DC have never sunk below a certain level-'Fly On The Wall',featuring Simon Wright as a replacement for Phil Rudd,manages to bring down the house without too many apologies.Even when they took it easy ,the masters rocked!Essential for a true fan."
3,A Solid Effort,"The songwriting and intensity are down from their works up to this point. Most would agree that by now Brian Johnson's voice had worn from years of touring. It's still an enjoyable recording, probably most enjoyed by hardcore fans."
1,weak...,"I am sorry to say anything bad about AC/DC (the best band...ever)but this is their worst album. The reason I gave it 1 star is for the one good on the record, ""SHAKE YOUR FOUNDATIONS"". It will never even remotely consider to even test Back In Black, The Razors Edge, or the Bon Scott years. Go buy something else..."
3,aye aye oh,Shake your foundations sums up this CD's contribution to AC/DC classics. Brian's voice is just rough and the high's are non existent. WHAT HAPPENED TO MUTT LANGE GUYS?
5,A classic of climbing photography,"Greg Epperson goes to great lengths to take wonderful photographs of climbers in action, and this book skims a little of the finer cream of his work. Epperson is among the finest of adventure photographers, and his crisply understated monochrome images provide a welcome respite from the saturated overdramatic work of better-known photographers such as Galen Rowell. If only this book were available in a much larger format!"
1,Attention!,"This is NOT a Lee Remick, Rock Hudson movie!!! This is a documentary about the automobile industry and has nothing to do with the 1978 TV mini-series called ""Arthur Hailey's Wheels"". The mini-series ran 540 minutes and is not available on VHS."
3,"Good Gran Sabana Coverage, but it falls apart!","The most unfortunte thing about this book is that it is poorly constructed and falls apart easily under even light ""travel"" strain. On the other hand, despite horrific maps, it is a fairly good guide. Thorough coverages is provided for both the Gran Sabana and Amazonas regions, including helpful narratives of people who have undertaken various explorations. It is especially useful if you plan to drive, as it occasionally mentions hotels with garages and gives detailed information on certain routes.Buy Bradt for the guide, but Lonely Planet Venezuela for the maps."
4,Absolutely un-confusing!,"I've been taking photos for 20 years, on and off. Only very few were to my satisfaction. So I started reading books on exposure but couldn't really understand them. I read Bahman Farzad's book during one quiet weekend and now I do not only understand exposure but also the other books I couldn't understand before. I'm not a professional photographer so I could only put so much time into figuring out the mysteries of exposure - therefore, this book is really ideal for those who want to finally understand things but with a limited investment of time. After explaining the fundamentals (most important) there are numerous special examples like photographing moonlit scenes etc. Highly recommended! Sometimes, there is too much repetition for my taste and sometimes the analogies might be a bit far-fetched. Also, I missed special hints on taking landscapes. But this question was promptly answered by Bahman trough email!"
5,Confused Photographer no More!,"Bahman's book is worth every penny, and then some!It is simple, easy to understand, and accounts for very light reading. I didn't need a phD to understand the mechanics of exposure, nor had difficulty understanding the Zone System. I found other books quite daunting.What I found most helpful were the illustrations that accompanied the sections being discussed -- it has been proven that illustrations help people retain more information rather than words... and Bahman has used this medium to get his learning points across very well.So, if you've been wanting to get better pictures (and not spending a bundle on film) get the book. I have been taking better pictures in the last couple of weeks... and while I'm still learning!One other thing, Bahman, unlike some authors, is accessible, and does spend time anwering e-mails!"
2,An OK Photo book,"Not really the zone system, but more adjusting what you meter is showing as 18% gray. (Ex.= If a person takes a picture of snow, one should open up the apeture or decrease the shutter speed a full two stops to get a natural white. If no compensation takes place, the snow will look gray (hense 18% gray)). One of the first things an amateur photographer needs to understand is how the camera's meter takes light readings. The book goes over some of this, but in a different way. Also, he completely leaves out how to compensate when using flash. His suggestions only work with slide film and maybe a little with digital photography. If you use this system with negative film, the lab will over-expose it every time. I've also noticed my digital camera over-exposes some subjects if I use this system. A better book in my opinion is ""Understanding Exposure"", by Bryan Peterson. I have referred to Bryan's book many times and keep it in my library of Photo books."
5,"Finally, I Get It!","I have long been trying not only to understand this wonderful technique but also apply it. Mr. Farzad has given me the secret keys to understanding the zone system in his unique style of teaching. For the first time, I now am more confident in my picture taking skills and no longer just take ""average"" photographs. I am now a work in progress thanks to this book. A MUST read for anyone serious about going to the next level."
2,NOT for Digital Photographers!,"Well, now I know why this book is out ofprint...it's for film photographers'!! I'm surethat it's a well written book-just outdated."
1,It's amazing . . .,"It's amazing that this book was ever published given its many defects. The author vastly complicates rather than clarifying the subject. His analogies and illustrations are puzzling and misleading and the quality the editing is very hit or miss. I cannot imagine that anyone who buys this book, no matter whether they be an expert or a beginner would be at all satisfied. If you do buy it for curiosity's sake, buy it from Amazon so you can benefit from their no hassles return policy."
2,Further confusing the confused,"I may be the only one dissenting on this tome, but I found this book to be not only boringly repetitive (as other reviewers did) and primary-school-basic (as others did), but also quite confusing. By using an endless variety of examples unrelated to photography in attempts to illustrate his points, he takes readers on useless and distracting excursions and manages to fill almost 300 pages to treat a subject which is perfectly treatable in 25-30 pages. Read Ansel Adams ""The Negative"" and other authors instead, or just consult your own camera or meter manual. You'll learn more in a shorter time than with Mr. Farzad's rambling and dull book."
3,Overly Complicated,"Bahman is an exposure master in his own right, but he unnecessarily complicates the Zone System theory with impossible hand drawings that confuse readers even more.The only rule I gained from the book is to use spot/partial metering 95% of the time. Works Great."
4,Great book,This book assumes that you know very little and then takes you through to teaching advanced techniques in getting the correct exposure every time. A well written book.
4,Quite good,"An easier way to understanding the zone-system than the classic ""The Negative"".Presentation quite original, perhaps a little chaotic at times. This is not a coffetable book. More like a print-out black and white manual inside. You will find parts in this book in his other excellent book on spotmetering. Wished he had included some information on the Nikon entry level D-40 along with all the other tabulated quick guides.I recommend this book along with his other on the spotmeter. They explain very well the relationships between iso, aparture, and shutterspeed and how to configure them in most photo-situations"
1,"way over hyped, read the fine print","Very disappointing, these are either equal brightness or dimmer than the regular old bulbs I pulled out(a bit 'whiter' yes, but 'brighter' no).Upon reading the package the specific wording as follows:""Claims based on measured comparisons between Silverstar Ultra product family at 100% light output and standard halogen bulbs at 80% light output.""Testing is so biased they had to write it on the package, and no doubt tested against the lowest rated halogens Sylvania was able to find.AND preceding the %50 brighter, 40% farther, and 50% wider is more small print stating ""*replacing worn standard bulbs provides:""(doesn't state anything about replacing them with silverstar ultras, any worn old bulbs will fade and you will notice a difference upon having a new bulb no matter what kind.Don't waste your money, at $24 it's comparable to regular bulb prices so fine."
3,"Nice bulbs, while they last!","These bulbs are a nice upgrade over stock 9004's. They give off a much whiter light without the silly blue tint some bulbs have. The downside is that they don't last very long. If you drive with your healights always on, I would stick with standard bulbs because these cost too much. Probably looking at 250-300 hour life."
1,waste of money,"I purchased these lights because I anticipated a lot of night driving this winter. I installed these bulbs on the right side of my 2001 Dodge truck in place of the bulbs that came with the vehicle 8 years ago. I couldn't tell the difference from the originals on the left so I asked my wife to look at them and tell me which was brighter; you guessed it, she said it looked like the left side (old bulb) was brighter!"
3,Nice Bulbs,"They seem to be brighter than the bulbs I replaced. Because the price was better here on Amazon, I purchased them. I would NOT buy them form local retailers as they wanted over $50 for these. If the price stays reasonable here at Amazon, I would continue to buy from here. Others have said they blow out premature, I have not experienced this. They are still working fine. If they do go out quickly I will come back here and modify this report. As of this time these lights seem slightly above average and that is the reason for the 3 stars (not less not more)."
1,A Quick Death,"I've replaced halogens before; I know not to touch. Both bulbs burnt out prematurely in 4 & 5 months. Too expensive for such a short life. While replacing, I compared left Sylvania bulb with right existing halogen; brightness only slightly better, but not worth the price. A poor value."
4,"Very nice upgrade, while they last...","The color is much closer to ""pure white"" (around 6500 Kelvin I believe), which is far easier on the eyes then the yellow light cast by standard quartz halogen bulbs. They project further and wider too, which makes driving at night in dark areas -- which I do quiet frequently -- much easier. The only drawback is longevity; they have none.You should consider yourself lucky if you get 1 year out of them. To a certain extent this happens with all of the ""ultra white"" style of bulbs, those that use blue filter tints on the glass capsule and gas other then halogen -- usually xenon or argon -- to create the additional intensity and color. Considering they cost several times more then convention bulbs that's a fairly significant issue. But while they work it's a very noticeable improvement."
3,Sylvania 9004SU BP Silverstar Ultra High Performance Halogen Headlights,"I purchased a set of these for our daughter's 1990 Toyota Corolla thinking that they would be a huge improvement over the original factory OEM lamps, but this has not been the case. They are a bit brighter but only seem to shine about as far as the original headlamps. I had originally thought about taking the vehicle to the shop to have the aim checked and verified to see if it would make any improvement, but based on the amount of current light output I am not so sure it will be worth it. I will recommend them, but don't expect any significant difference in their performance over OEM quality lamps."
1,They send me a old model.,"This was a good price for the product that they show in the picture, but the truth is they send me a old model that is the same as walmart has for the same price, why I would go online to buy something and wait for it if I can get it anytime. So this trick is not fair if you show the latest model you should send that one."
1,a flashlight would be better,Purchased a set of these to replace originals in my 2010 SUV. Absolutely no difference in brightness. One of the worst investments I ever made. Don't waste your money. Having someone walk in front of you with a lit candle would be just as good.
2,"Brighter, but at a big cost","I will admit these bulbs are an improvement over standard bulbs but they don't last very long at all and I had one bulb shatter inside the housing which ruined the reflector. I was very careful when I installed it and didn't touch it and it worked fine for months before it just exploded one day. As such, I am going back to the stock bulbs and won't waste my money on these again."
1,Sylvania 9004SU BP SilverStar Ultra High Performance Halogen Headlight - Pack of 2,"Well i wanted a much brighter Headlight, so i bought what i thought, was suppose to be the brightest light from Sylvania. In short, they just stink. The headlights are not at all what i was expecting, and i notice very little difference form the No Name Lights i bought from JC Whitney before these. If you are looking for a brighter Light do not waste your money buying these. For a little more i could have bought a Plug & Play HID kit. I think Sylavania makes one standard bulb and has different packaging."
2,"Nice Bulbs, but they ony last a year if your lucky!",These bulbs produce a nice amount of light especially over the stock ones the biggest problem with them is that they only last about a year if your lucky I have had three different sets and they all last almost a year. The last ones only lasted about 7 months so I am going to try different bulbs!
5,Amazon + Sylvania - a good combination,Buying the light bulbs online for an old car can be tricky. This is not the case with Amazon/Sylvania who used my data to provide a perfect match to my requirements. Thanks
1,bulb blew in less than 1 month after purchase!!!!,"I am totally disatisfied with this product! One of headlamps burn out after installation and it was NOT even used/operated for a complete month. This is very disconcerting, considering the cost of this product and its producer! Not happy at all!!!!!!"
2,"Not much life, not much (more) light","I purchased a pair of these in March 2009 from Amazon. There was a rebate so the price wasn't terrible. That is about the best news.The light output was not notably higher than the standard halogen bulbs in my Maxima. 10 months later, one has already burned out. The product packaging warns of short life. What it doesn't warn is that the product, at least to my perception, doesn't provide much more light from a standard bulb in real world situations.My headlight bulbs aren't difficult to change but I wouldn't put these things in again if someone gave them to me. Just not enough more light...even IF the life of the bulb was decent."
4,I love these lights!!,"I have been using the Silverstars in my vehicles for a while now. I love the whiteness of the light. I have no proof that they actually put out more lumens, but they sure do look brighter. The standard halogens have a yellow look compared to these. I took away one star because they are not perfect. My main complaint is that they do not last very long. The other complaint that I noticed (it took years to notice) was during a heavy snow storm, I couldn't see!! I realized that the light was so white and bright, that the snow reflected the light back at me and blinded me!! I shut the lights off when there were no cars around me, and I was able to see better with just street lights and moon light. In all fairness though, I did not have other headlights to do an A/B comparison with so they may have been just as bad, but I don't think that would have been the case. Overall, I highly recommend these lights for better visibility."
4,9004SU BP,"A definite improvement over standard headlights, but I think the claim of 25% improvement is over exaggerated."
1,"Whiter and brighter, but not for long","These bulbs appear both whiter and brighter than the two Sylvanias I replaced. I have edited this review because one of the bulbs burned out after only a few weeks. Amazon sent a replacement package, but I had already installed another brand. So the jury is still out on this one."
2,Dont waste your $$$,I should've listen to some people that wrote the same thing here... its the same cheap light bulbs you would find at the store but with an outrageous price..AVOID!!!!!
2,Not as bright as expected,"The bulbs were not as bright as we expected them to be. Husband ended up buying different bulbs and disposed of these bulbs, that's how unhappy he was with them."
2,too expensive,it says that this is white but its not white at all I am disappointed for that price i could buy a xenon lights the whole kit. sorry my grammar is not very good
4,Upgrading car headlights,"I installed these headlight bulbs in a '93 Plymouth Voyager mini-van. Anyone that has replaced a headlight bulb on any relatively modern car can install these. They have resulted in markedly better illumination down the roads. I felt it was well worth the cost.Sylvania 9007SU BP TWIN SilverStar Ultra, Twin Pack"
2,Great light - burns out very quickly!,I had these installed on my 2001 Nissan Xterra. My night-time vision is not great. I found the Silverstar Ultras a great improvement over the factory installed bulbs in terms of brightness and field of vision.However one burned out within a year and I replaced again with the Silverstar Ultra. Two weeks later the other one burned out and so I had no option but to putchase yet another Silverstar Ultra. Looking at Xterra bulletin boards I have found other owners with similar problems with the product.The bulbs give off great light but I would not be buying again. Xterra owners beware!
3,Good hisory of the Wolf,"This is a good video on the history of the wolf and show's how much of a bad rap they get. But its basically about european wolfs. Great video to have if you are a wolf lover, collector."
5,I actually cried the whole way through,"I can't get sick of this sound, this intense synergy. Pure passion, from start to finish. This cd does not disappoint. The vocal broke my heart. It's an unusually feminine but totally modern approach to some of the great old songs - Ciao Bella Ciao, I'te Vurria Vasa. A cool modernized and really ethnic sounding George Brassens ""Chanson Pour l""Auvergnat"" was a nice surprise. A good mix of fast and slow. A good intro for children to music in European languages - my students loved it."
5,This book gava me the confidence to learn to cook almost anything..,"I bought this book at least twenty years ago. I was single and didn't really cook much of anything. When I tried the recipes, they were so good, and so easy to grasp, that I started making risotto frequently. This gave me the confidence to branch out and try new things. Now I can cook almost anything and ""Risotto"" is one of many, many cookbooks on the shelf. Almost every recipe I have tried from this book is at least good, and most are excellent. Tonight I did wild mushrooms and dried Porcinis. Perfect for a December evening. Needless to say, everyone loved it. I'm amazed but happy that this book is still in print after 22 years. If you don't own it, but like to cook risotto, order it now. You won't regret it."
4,Great Recipe Book,"Great book for the at home chefs. Cooking is something my husband and I love to do, so to find something clear and easy to ready was a must.Received the book quickly from the seller in described condition."
4,Risotto,"A lot of work goes into these recipes. They are not simple. l If you love this type of food and have it often, the book would really be great. There are many items that must go into preparing receipes from this book. If you just have rice receipes occasionally, you would do just as well to go to your Better Homes Cook Books or other regular cook books to search for a simple receipe. I would purchase again but it is a large book and will take up a lot of room in my receipe books area."
4,Risotto Lovers Unite!!,"Risotto has been a dish that I have loved ever since I was a child, and this book not only includes a truckload of recipes, ranging from the traditional to the truly creative, but it's also prefaced with an interesting account to the origins of this fabulous Italian creation. Not being a cook, I enjoy this book for its straightforwardness and lack of pretension. Risotto is also a versatile dish that can be easily prepared with various vegetables, cheeses, fish, beef, etc. As such, the chapters are broken down according to the kind of risotto one would like to prepare. This also makes the book easy to understand and thoroughly enjoyable. It takes a lot for me to invest in any kind of cook book, so if I say this one is worth it, I mean it."
5,Wonderful recipes,"We love the book and have used it for years. Besides having excellent recipes, the book often serves as a springboard for our own creativity and we have made some riffs on the recipes that we like a lot.One caveat: I don't know if it's the book, our rice source, our cooking pot, or us, but we invariably find that we need up to a cup more broth than specified, and that it takes us 10-20 more minutes than the recipes suggest (and we like our risotto al dente, so it's not like we're cooking it to mush). Just an FYI; it certainly hasn't kept us from using the book.There are just two of us, so we always have leftovers, but the suggestions for using them are excellent. In fact, we sometimes make risotto just so we can make the risotto ""fritters"" the next day."
3,Just okay,"Although this is a good vacuum, it isn't as good as I thought it would be. The suction is just a tad bit better than my previous vacuum. I constantly have to change the level of the vacuum because it picks up some items on one setting and not others and vice versa. I probably would not buy this vacuum again nor recommend it. For the money, it just wasn't worth the price and I would never pay full price for a kirby, never ever. I'm now considering a dyson. I wish there was a way to test these things PRIOR to purchase."
5,Very nice!,"My 6 years old daugher loves it very much, wants to play it every day. The games are easy to learn and easy to play. The best part is, they giveyou a bag to hold all games, you know what I mean if you have kids too --a lot of toys are played only once and then lost in the jungle of othertoys. With the bag it is easy to organize and find the games."
4,Good Stuff,I really like this product. The scent is very subtle and I love the way it feels on my skin. I will be purchasing more products from Carol's Daughter.
3,not Warm Spirit but nice,"I love the scent. It must be layerd. It is not too drying but doesnt leave that ""cant help but touch myself"" feeling like warm spirit. Id but more."
3,smell not good,it was not bad but just soso. the texture was ok but not keeping my skin mostrized over hours. it smells very artificial. wont buy again.
5,GREAT PRODUCT,I have purchased this from my Dr.'s office for years. Just a thought to check Amazon.com and found it much cheaper. Glad I looked
2,average,"Very overpriced. Save money and go buy something way cheaper, as good or even better from your local pharmacy. Not recommended."
5,Predicting the Future Made Easy,"I used to think predicting the future was difficult. I was in awe of people who could do it. Then I read Kenneth W. Gronbach's book on Generational Marketing, ""Common Census,"" and all of a sudden I got a heck of a lot smarter. As Ken says, ""Do the math."" In an informative, eye-opening (you'll spend a lot of time muttering, ""Boy, that makes a lot of sense."") easy-to-read style, Ken takes you through America's populations shifts of the last one hundred years to show how trends are created; economically, socially and politically. Everything from why certain products will or will not sell to; should you be worried about the rise of crime.A great tutorial on generational marketing that just explodes so many media created myths."
4,Available free from the author,"This report begins to look at strategies for raising the educational attainment of Latinos in California. The purpose of this paper is not to provide a comprehensive treatise on a particular issue, but rather to get the reader to start thinking about linkages that can occur across the different sectors. We need to not only consider the K-12 and higher education systems, but we must also look to preschools, economic development agencies, the private sector, community based organizations, and any other organization that can work with the community. This paper has 11 different sections and 33 contributors. Some sections include options for further consideration...."
5,Superbly done album,"With lyrics mainly done by Mike Rutherford and vocals of Paul Carrack and Paul Young, how can you go wrong? This album proves that very notion that nothing can go wrong. Of course, the three hit songs are very well done, but ""A Call to Arms"" and ""Hanging By a Thread"" are a true sign of creative songwriting. Anyone who likes good music, will love Mike and the Mechanics."
5,"Will always be ""stuck in the 80's""!",The music of the 80's was GREAT! I love Mike & the Mechanics and have a lot of great memories listening to their music. This is a great CD and I'm so glad I purchased it. Just wish the musicians of today were as good as the music was in the 80's! Love this CD!
1,don't waste your money,"With the name ""Tiny TEETHERS"" I assumed, wrongly, that my daughter could safely teethe on these books. While they do have a teething ring attached, my 9 month old only wants to chew on the board book pages. The problem? The books have almost completely disintegrated. This is just like chewing on any other book, but with a teething ring handle to hold while doing it. Don't waste your money....just buy a teething ring and soft chewable books until your baby is old enough for board books."
2,You get what you pay for...,"This is a small reference book, full of names, addresses & contact info for hot sauce vendors. But, don't expect an eye-popper, there's not much more to it than your local yellow pages. I bought this as a stocking stuffer for a hot sauce enthusiast, and wound up not giving it. Based on the photo, I expected a colorful book, full of pictures of hot sauce bottles, chilis, and what-not. There are no pictures, just listings. It has all the excitement of the local phone directory. The paper is newsprint-like, adding to the ""yellow pages"" tone of the book. It is very small in reality, pocketbook size, and thin. The content is not ~remotely~ exciting as I'd hoped.But,,, if you're just looking for a small portable directory to find names & addresses for hot saucing, this little ... book could be handy........"
4,Must Have Ruler,"This is a must have ruler in your supply. The 12.5 x 12.5 size is perfect for cutting the large blocks I do. Its nice and sturdy, the yellow printing is great on darker colors, but hard to see on lighter colors of course. The product is very good, just as I had expected. I would recommend it to anyone. The order arrived on time and in perfect condition."
4,12x12 Omnigrid,"I'm new to quilting so I needed tools. One of the first was the 12x12 Omnigrid. It is easy to use but you do have to pay attention to the scales and the orientation on the fabric or you mill not get the desired measurement. As long as you pay attention, the cutting of fabric is simple. You can easily line up where you want and the blade runs right next to it. Getting perfect squares is easy. Learning to sew a straight line is a bit harder."
5,Omnigrid 12-1/2 inch by 12-1/2 inch Quilters square,Works great for squaring up fabrics. I use it after I have quilted to square all the corners before finishing my quilt.
5,ahhh the soothing sounds of king tubby,King Tubby is one of the reggae/Dub masters. This prodigious offering by KT cannot be described in words. A little heavier on the traditional dub beats than some of his other albums but overall another great KT offering. I however cannot call it my favorite because I like all of his albums. So pick this one up today and you won't be dissapointed.
4,surround system upgrade,"Not the costliest or fanciest name on the market but works great and the $$$ was right. Unless you need a super pimp system, you can't go wrong with this Sony product."
4,Speakers,"Worth the small investment, you will not find any better speakers for the money, Ive looked.Sony SS-CR3000 Center and Rear Channel Speaker Package"
4,overall good,"I initially bought these speakers to replace some larger Cerwin Vegas. You really have to turn up the volume to hear them. If you are going to use them in a small room or bedroom, these will be adequate. The rear speakers are perfect for hiding away though. I attached one of mine to the trunk of a small artificial tree to get it out of site and a little higher up - works perfectly and nobody can see it."
4,Great Value,Good value for the money. I purchased this mainly for the center speaker as the kit was less expensive than the center on its own. Integrates well with my Sony amp.
4,Sony Speakers,Theses speakers provide a compact size and the Sony quality sound you are looking for.
5,Did everything I expected it to and more,"I purchased this along with a small powered subwoofer to upgrade the stereo setup that we had been using for the past ten years. Our room is only about 12 X 16, so I thought these would do the job. They did. I could not have imagined the difference that the center channel and surrounds would make. I had heard that the center channel was important, but figured it was just hype. I am more than pleased. If you have a small to medium sized room, you may want to give these a try. These speakers and the sub have been the best decision to move us from stereo TV to a nice home theater; all for under $200. I can't believe I put it off so long. I certainly would have done it sooner if I realized the change it would have made."
3,Don't expect much from this little system,"Purchased this mainly for the center speaker which was the right size to fit in the opening of my projection TV system. Was somewhat disappointed, the center speaker sounded very tinny and also had slight distortion in the upper frequencies at very moderate listening levels that everybody noticed. Ended up moving the surround sound rear speakers to the front and wiring into the center channel to get a better sound. Unless you just have to have a center channel speaker this small I would recommend you get something larger and better. These speakers are connected to a decent 5.1 Sony receiver."
5,Good Purchase,"I ordered these speakers on a Friday and received them the following Wednesday with the free shipping offer. Pretty amazing Amazon. I was really surprised at the difference this speaker set made. I used the two surround speakers as front speakers because I already had Yahama in-wall speakers for my rear speakers. I put the speakers at the same height as the center speaker and have them all hooked to a Denon AVR-790. Previously I had to turn the volume up to hear the dialog but not any more. After calibrating the sound system I can run the volume much lower and still hear the dialog distinctly, even with background music and sounds coming from the other speakers. Great product at a great price. I recommend this speaker set and also recommend buying them from Amazon."
4,Modest,"I purchased this set because I was upgrading from a stereo system to true surround sound. The center channel sounds excellent for mid and high ranges that include voice, but when there are other sounds such as loud booms or traffic, it gets a little bit murky with lower frequencies, but that can be expected, as the center channel is intended for midranges. The two back surrounds sound great, but they are very small, and don't put out a whole lot of power (I do have my rear channels set at +6dB, and yet still I am not satisfied with the output, so I had to move the rear channels closer to the sitting area). They too, distort on the lower end frequencies, but it's not as noticeable since they're not in use most of the time. Visually, they're not as appealing as some other same priced models, and they don't offer the option of taking the grill off, which I don't prefer anyhow, but some people do."
1,not worth the money,"I was looking for an inexpensive speaker system. Be careful what you ask for; it sounded OK enough in a very small room, but once it was moved to a slightly bigger one, the volume had to be cranked up and the speakers sounded terrible; the cheap computer speakers that came with my last computer sounded better. I've since replaced them with a compact soundbar that sounds significantly better."
3,Bought the Sony SS-CR3000's,I think I was a little naive prior to this purchase on what I was actually buying. I have since connected the speakers and find they do enhance the overall sound quality of DVD's and TV. The speakers are driven by a Sony STR-DG910; 7.1. I am running some JBL book shelf speakers for the fronts for now. The overall volume is not as loud as I thought it would be. To complete this set up I plan to up the speaker wire size from 18ga to something 14ga or larger. Also plan to add a sub-woofer and maybe some different fronts. That should improve things. Any other ideas?
2,Speakers,"I couldn't use them so returned them. The weren't suitable for the space I have to work with, but will keep looking."
3,Not Tech Savvy,I never got to use these speakers because you have to have an ampliphier. Which I didn't know. So I never got to use them I you aren't tech savvy I thought you should know.
1,incomplete,"While it looked fine, it doesn't work without an amplifier. This should have been clear. It wasn't. Product might be good, but if it's unusable, then so what."
3,"Cheap: Price, Quality & Sound","I bought these as a cheap filler for my 5.1 setup with mid-grade Polk fronts and 7.2 Yamaha receiver. The plan is to eventually upgrade these and move them to Surround Rear duty or Zone 2 as I grow the system. I purchased full well knowing these were cheap speakers, that Sony generally gets bad reviews among the A/V crowd and that I wouldn't be too impressed.They lived up to their reputation. The sound quality is certainly low and the build construction isn't anything to write home about but the price is right. When you consider that getting the complementing Polk versions of surrounds and center would cost around ~$200, this is a steal. I would recommend these to two groups of people: Those who don't care in the first place and would settle for a HTIB anyway and those that are using them as a placeholder to accompany quality fronts. The reality is that even in a surround setup, the fronts are ~80% of the experience."
4,Sony Speakers,I bought mainly for the center speaker. Works great for the size/price. Left and right speakers put out good sound for their size.
1,READ BEFORE ORDERING!,"I ordered the SS-CR3000 speakers but was surprised when they arrived. They were smaller than I expected with mostly midrange sound output. There was almost no bass output and the treble was weak. The grille covers cannot be removed but with a bright flashlight I could see that the drivers were much smaller than 4.75"" as indicated on Amazon's web site. They actually had 2.75"" drivers, two in the center and one in each surround speaker. Sony's web site also lists the drivers as 4.75"" so this might not be Amazon's fault.On a positive note returning the speakers was easy. It was within 30 days of purchase so Amazon emailed a return shipping label."
3,nice looking product,"Great looking product, but it did not meet my tv quality. There was no description of the product to inform me that it was not plug in speakers and that they were wires that needed to be wired into the tv. I could not hook them up so I don't know of the sound quality."
1,Won't connect to TV,"I don't know if these speakers sound good or not, because I can't connect them to my TV without a stereo receiver or amp. The speaker have only the 2 wire connection, like any stereo speaker, but no RCA or any plug that will go to my TV. This is disappointing because I searched on ""TV Speakers"" and these (plus lots of others) came up. I guess I was wrong to assume like I did. I will probably return these and try another product."
2,Cute but noisy.,"These speakers are cute and looks nice but I noticed that it created a lot of static noise. I'm not sure why, maybe it has something to do with short circuits. I noticed that whenever a cell phone was about to go off or if someone passed by talking on a cell phone, the speakers would make a loud noise with static. It became so annoying that I have stopped using these speakers at work."
3,Kid's video,"This is a 10 minute video about wool production aimed at school children kindergarten through 4th. grade, one of their 15-part ""Farm to Market"" series."
1,@,"I WANT ONE C.D. WITH MIKE MAREEN BUT I DON'T HAVE A VISA CARD OR ANY CARD .PLEASE SEND TO ME THE C.D. ALBUM ""LET'S START NOW"" AND I PROMISE TO PAY YOU WHEN I TAKE THE C.D. PAR POSTAL PACKET.MY ADRESS IS ""TURCU MARIUS , B-DUL 1 DECEMBRIE 1918 182/7 TG-MURES - ROMANIA "" . MY PHONE IS 065/141255 ( WITHOUT PREFIX OF ROMANIA) THANK YOU !"
1,DermaSeptic didn't work,I had an outbrake just a couple of days after I got it. Didn't work. Did all what the instructions asked to do. May have lengthen the outbrake period but at the end no effect was achieved. Will try once again next time.
1,Negative results,"I did not see any improvement with the DermaSeptic Skin Care Kit, I had the same healing time with or without it."
1,Expensive and Worthless,Bought this because I have a couple outbreaks a year and thought I would be ready for the next one. Followed all the instructions and the light would not come on. Replaced the battery not knowing how long it may have been in the unit on a shelf and nothing. The silver tip looked like it had already been in contact with the emery board so I was probably sold a defective unit to begin with. It was a lot of money so I can't imagine they thought no one would notice. Geez.
3,Ironic - no outbreaks since purchase - go figure!!!,"I purchased this because I was having very frequent episodes of out breaks. But since its purchase, low and behold, no more outbreaks. Odd, go figure. Can't say looking forward to using this but if I do need it will actually try it."
4,Pleased with results,"Wasn't sure if this would work but read all comments & saw it was a 50/50 split. I have a few fever blister breakouts. Finally got to test run it, mmm....was surprised... It slowed the blister down quicker than going through the normal cycle. I also combined taking extra Lysine & applying cream on it as well for 3 way attack. The blister stayed small, scabbed over quicker & didn't take the average 2wks of battling & having it break open.. Which it never did. I think my combination worked at least on my & like this product....Only 1 way to try it out...find your way for best results."
1,Rip off dont buy this product,"I purchased the dermaseptic and I got ripped off. the silver tab that you apply to the cold sore has to be sanded with an emory board. upon close examination I noticed that my brand new dermaseptic device had been sanded already and the copper metal under the silver tab was visible. I think they sent me a reconditioned device that had been used. it was not new. so, I am not sure if it works or not. It hasn't helped me at all. it was a waste of $100. dont buy this product."
2,Scam,"I knew it was too good to be true. I've seen the same product in Skymall magazine for much more and I'm glad I purchased it on Amazon because of the good return policy. This product does not do any miracles and it simply does not work. All those claims about silver are false and conventional wisdom told me not to purchase this, but I took a leap of faith. Overall I would say save your money and go visit a doctor."
2,Disappointed,Been using the product for about one year now on about 3 occasions on cold sores. I haven't really noticed effectiveness of the device. The only thing it might do is possibly shorten the healing process by a day or so but that's about it. Don't expect any miracles.
2,Item Good not amazing the process as bad as possible,"It Work in a while but with no ""dramatic results"" as the seller claim.Very bad experience in the buying process, because a Item of above 89 USD, I was charged for more 230 USD with shipping rates an they didn't send enough specification of the product, then it caused a very difficult process in customs and extra rates in UPS reaching near 300 USD total cost.Bad service experiencie + no amazing product + extra costs = unsatisfied"
5,Just the facts please (so I can understand them),"Short and to the point: want to understand what the bible says about angels in a way that will not glaze you eyes over?? This is your book. There is no "" I feel this or I thing that"" stuff here. It is look at this Bible reference it plainly tells us A, add that to B and we end up with an understandable and believable C. Very well written and an easy read"
4,Excellent Biblical study of Angelology!,"This book provides a thorough Biblical study of angels and demons covering such topics as:- existence, number and nature of angels- relationship of angels to humans- dwelling places of angels- activities of angels and fallen angels.I found it particularly enlightening as Mr Showers provides comprehensive Biblical support for the various topics he addresses.I thoroughly recommend it for anyone wanting to better understand Angelology."
3,Basic Knowledge about Angels,"If you know little to nothing about Angels and you want to know more then this is a great book for you. I've been researhing Angels for a while now, and i still learned a little bit that i hadn't before. I agree with most of the authors research and statements, but not all of them. But you dont have to agree with all of it in order for it to be a good book and something that can teach you something new. I recommend it to anyone looking to know more about the Angels mentioned in the Bible and Angels in general."
2,Not what I was hoping for.,"First of all I'd like to say that this video would be helpful to a person who knows nothing of home brewing. That being said, if you have brewed anything before then you will learn very little from this DVD. I was hoping to learn more about the specifics of Barley Wine."
2,Very disappointing,"This game is just awful. I'm a huge fan of the tv series but the board game is just lame. Firstly, understanding how to play this game takes forever and it has tones of flaws. Game play is inconsistent and boring. It does not connect well with the tv series at all. We played this game one evening but eventually we just gave up. Now it's under my desk making use as a foot rest."
1,Makes Cool Colors in the Fireplace!,"We tried, we cried and IT DIED......Worse game ever conceived and published! We put the whole thing in our fireplace, poured everybody a glass of wine and it made really cool colors when it ignited and burnt! Best ending ever to a game from Hell!!"
1,Don't Bother with this game!,"I bought this game for my sons who are total LOST fanatics. They literally count the days for the next episode to be aired. I thought this game would be a huge hit, but after spending an hour trying to read the directions (poorly written) and starting to play, my sons got bored and abandoned it altogether. They found the play to be arduous and just plain NOT FUN. I agree with the other reviewer that it would make a better computer game. Please, please come up with a better LOST game!!!!"
2,Terribly Frustrating,"I recently had a group of friends over and we tried to play this game and could barely understand the directions!! It was terrible. We ended up quitting after an hour or two trying to understand what was going on reading beginner, advanced and cheat sheet directions. This would've been a much more effective computer game than board game."
2,"SO FAR, NO GOOD","I finally broke this out and tried to play it on New Year's Eve. My mom and I set up the pieces and were about to play when we realized the instructions made absolutely no sense. Maybe if you are familiar with role-playing games like Dungeons & Dragons it would be clearer, I don't know. I had no clue. We packed everything up and played cards instead. I'm going to look for the new instructions other reviewers have mentioned (at www.losttheboardgame.com). Hopefully they will clear things up and we can start playing! Otherwise, this was a complete waste of money and huge disappointment."
1,WTF?,"Welcome to hell in a box. For starters, the amount of pieces that need to be setup and used is just crazy. It took us almost 30 minutes to even set the board up. Next, we realized that the instructions were just unreadable. Just when you think you have this game figured out, you stumble across some new card or some new instruction that totally changes everything you thought you knew already. About 10 minutes into the game, we also realized that none of the cards can actually be used in play until you have been playing for at least 3 days. This game is worse than watching 5 straight episodes of Jack stuck in a bear cage. Save your money and do not buy this game. If you want a copy anyway, check my trash can."
1,Collectable means junk!,"The description was a total lie. It came scratched up, dented and with a sticker over a place where someone wrote with a sharpie $4.00. I paid $12.99.It was taped up with tape that damaged the tin and when I opened it the contents where just thrown in and huge mess. The description said good condition only opened once and a collectable. If that means a piece of yard sale junk then then I guess I got just that!"
4,FUN- but hard to get used to...,"I Absolutley LOVE the show Lost, because it plays with my mind and gives me something to think about, and that's exactly what the board game did aswell. It's almost as if you make your own episode, or your own season when you play the game! But as others have clearly noted, it isn't like a normal game, and the instructions could have been better written. If you are a person who really doesn't like putting time into things, then no, i suggest you don't get this game, but if your like me and really get into things that give you a challenge, then go for it, get the game, take a bit of time to solve it, then play it! Nonthless, it's a game exactly alluding to it's show! Once you get used to it, It's a GREAT GAME! Overall i rate it 4 out of 5, and congratualte the makers on their fine efforts!"
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"With a show as popular as LOST, it's inevitable that cheaply produced merchandise will be released quickly to capitalize on the success of the show before it's too late. This game seems to completely fit that mold. This game is not fun. The instructions are vague and confusing. The game play is cumbersome and requires far too much patience. Don't waste your time on this game. The LOST puzzles were a lot more fun and rewarding than this game.Lost 1000 Piece Puzzle - #1 the Hatch"
1,Not trivia,"I should have read it closer, I thought it was trivial pursuit not just dungeons and dragons ""lost style""- not that there is anything wrong with that"
1,It's only fun if you don't get corruption or FSOD,"Hello all of you reading this who don't have PSO, READ THIS!!!:Ok, first if you only play this game offline, you're fine. However, if you ever decide to play online with this game, Sega has a HORRIBLE server. There are two thing that can happen when you play online. The first is known as FSOD, frozen screen of death, the screen freezes, and all your unequipped items vanish, because the only way to unfreeze is to turn off the GC. Next is corruption. Since the games has a ""double save"", the memory card can sometimes reject the second save, causing your card to get corrupted, and all your saved info, ERASED. This even happens with a Nintendo made memory card. So, if you're thinking of playing this game online, create a backup character, learn how to dupe, and dupe all your items to that character on a DIFFERENT memory card. I was the head of a club, and part of many other clubs, and now it's all gone due to corruption. Players BEWARE!!!"
5,this game rocks,even thou this game is a lot o money its worth it I think its awesome. there are cool caracters n weapons it is a great rpg. u should get it .
2,Great game...,If you didn't have to pay 9 bucks a month for it. Go find the original unopened and a Dreamcast. It's free and basicaly the same expierience. The 9 dollar fee is totaly uncalled for and not worth it. Skip this game. It's great but not 9 bucks a month great.
5,PHANTASY STAR ONLINE VERSION 2,"this game kicks ass! i liked the first 1 because i was a level 79 and i stoped playing it but since i hav a gamecube i can play it online and i will be 1 of the first people to go online with it. once i start playing this game i will not stop playing it because im so addicted 2 it that i stay on for 8 to 12 hours strait, im in love with this game!"
2,Same thing over and over and over and over again,"Since my parents wont let me get an account this review is based on the offline play.First of all this game is VERY, VERY monotonous. Monsters are repeated very, very much. The designers got so obsessed with a monster they made like about 7 types of that monster, and the only thing that varied the types were the color and size. Also there aren't many different monsters in the game.Also, most of episode 1 takes place underground; underground mines, caves and ruins. And at each place the same freaking rooms are repeated over and over again.The game play at first is OK, as well as the weapons, character types (well balanced) and character creation. But this game will bore you in a week or two, that is if you don't play it so often.It has the same graphics as the dreamcast version."
5,Best RPG Ever!,"I'm not a big fan of the whole RPG world, but since I started playing PSO I have gotten into it. It is fun because you don't pick your moves you atually do everything yourself. The Battling is actually fun, and never gets boring. There is such a large amount of weapons that your always looking for that weapon that suits you perfectly. Personally I like Rifles. I have not been playing it that long, and I already notice that it is ten times better than any Final Fantasy RPG out.There is so much more to it. Then the best part is you can play it in multi player mode. That is when the real fun kicks in.I havn't even played it online yet. Online gaming with this is probably a blast.If you are a big fan of RPGs. You must pick this game up as soon as possible."
5,Dang this is TIGHT!,"I played the first pso title at my friends house and got unregretebly obbsessed with it.So when I went to E3 I saw it and had to play it. The game is great!From the MAG raising,new characters, and levels I can only sum it all up in one word, VICIOUS!!!!!!"
1,Don't even pick it up....what a waste of time and money.,"Yes...I know, you RPG fans won't pay any attention to me, but leave this horrible game alone. Don't buy, or even rent this disgrace to RPG games. I was very dissapionted with this game. You don't even have to think when you play this game. THE PUZZLES ARE NOT THE LEAST BIT CHALLENGING. All you do is run around and shoot stuff.Try staring at a wall for an hour. PSO is exactly as entertainingas a wall. If there was a category for very boring games, this game would get the gold medal. Even if you see PSO for cheap, just walkaway from it, unless you can't get to sleep. Play this game for a few minutes and you'll be sound asleepPROS: Good multiplayer/online play+Play this if you can't get to sleepCONS: Levels are waaaaaaaay too long-Puzzles are simple-as exciting as a wall-Barely any plot lines-an overall horrible game"
5,Most Addicting Rpg Ever,"This is the best RPG iv'e ever played. It has so much variety. From doing the quest alone to doing it with 3 friends you'll spend countless hours enjoying this game. It has an interesting storyline, great gameplay, awsome graphics and a great soundtrack. From leveling up to searching for rare weapons, armor, and spells there really wasn't a dull moment in this game. There is one problem though. There are people online who use gameshark (a cheat device) who may do something to you which may ruin the experience. Such as kill you and take your best items! Hopefully this can be fixed in the GCN release. Still, even if it's not,this game is still worth buying regardless of the people who cheat."
5,Most fun I ever had playing an RPG,"this is the best game ive ever played, it has so much content and gameplay to keep you playing for hours and hours. and the thing that makes it even more cool is that you can go online with your friends and play with each other. I bought the original pso for the dreamcast when it first came out and i couldnt put the game down. A good piece of advice is to feed your mag the bigger healing things like tri fluid and di fluid it will help raise their stats fast!"
4,Get it While you can or Get PSO plus when it comes out!!!!!!,"This Game rocks!!!!!!!!!!!! Buy it as soon as possible! Some people say that its boring and while the levels get slightly repetetive the greater the level or the more you play through a level the more you will find. It starts of at normal difficulty and you can unlock hard, very hard, and ULTIMATE! The incentive for playing to ultimate is that there are over 250 unique items that are all accesible to find in ultimate!!! The items are so different looking that you kind of want to get all the items in the game. There are three classes force, ranger (THE BEST), and hunter. I have played this game extensively and still sadly have not gotten online but I know from friends that it is utterly amazing with new quests and items and mini-games!! Its totally worth $9 a month! Buy it while you can! I would give it 100 of 100 stars but it doesn't go that high!!!! Hope this helps. PSO ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,"Good game, but only if you play online","Phantasy Star Online can be best enjoyed when playing online with friends. To be realistic, dungeon-crawling by yourself isn't very fun, and it gets boring after a while. If you can get a broadband adapter and pay the monthly fee, I suggest you do so, because offline multiplayer, while fun, just isn't as rewarding as playing online."
4,WOWZERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This game is one of the best role playing games ever, there are a few problems like when your walking the backround all of a sudden pops up, but still this game ROX!!!!!! If you like japaneese futuristic rpg's this is the game to buy also a nother great thing is u can play online, the first time nintendo came up with a good idea for a long time. Well basically what im telling u is if u have a game cube and u like rpg's buy thisGAME NOW!!! LOL J\K if your not sure rent it and see what its like!"
3,This game is pretty cool,"Well, its ok except for the cheats for online, i mean that takes the fun out of it. It should be like starcraft or something, like you can only do cheats offline. Oh well, this game is still pretty cool, I CANT WAIT TILL IT COMES OUT! The demo was sweet, you can create a cool character. I almost made me.. hehe, just kidding. All in all this one deserves 1 and a half thumbs up."
5,The BEST Online RPG,"SEGA did an awsome job with PSO. I have had countless sleepless nights and involuntary fastings cause of this game. One of the first online RPG's to hit the market... Gameplay is unique and one of the best. Over 100's of weps to use from and over 10 characters you can customize from head to toe. From the smallest details, like: face paint, proportion, color of eyes, costume, hair, and over 10 different hairstyles for most of the characters. The only real problem with this game is that online many people have GameShark (GS) and Xploder... People that have the GS and Xploder mess up the fun of this game... Which is serching for Rares through out the game. GS and Xploder allows them to make weapons, armor, mags, etc... Hope that for the GameCube version they choose to band the use of GS, Xploder, or anything else that alters the gameplay of PSO online."
5,It's real simple...,"Basically, it's real simple: I almost failed my 3rd year of law school because of the Dreamcast version of this game.This game is the most amazing game I have ever played. In fact, I had never played an RPG before PSO - PSO is sooo good, that I know play other RPG's on my dreamcast just because I was attracted to this genre by PSO.PSO is a great family game, too. My fiance' and I used to play it all the time, and she eventually made her own character. It's a good game to attract both younger and older players to gaming and particularly the RPG genre."
3,Why not,this game is great it is very fun doing almost all of the missions except for the ones with the people that always die than i get mad and break my controller. the only other bad thing about this game is that online people try and give you illegal items which are sometimes good and other times they kill you. to top it off with that people try to pk you which means they cast the opposite of resta(a healing spell) and it kills you in one hit than they collect your items and money and sigh off. overall this will be a great game if they are able to block people who pk u.
2,It is not what I though was gone to be,"I order this product thinking that it was going to have the whole house smell good when I will burn it on my dish.It doesn't smell that much, I think the product is not what they describe, will never buy it again."
4,handy for daycare,"I like these containers better than any other plastic ones I've found, but one drawback is the fact that they don't stack inside one another... so they take up a lot of space. I've tried to get away from all plastic due to health concerns, so I still won't heat anything up in them or wash in the dishwasher... so ultimately, they're not that practical for me. But they're sturdy and don't leak."
4,for the future cosmotologists,"My daughter is way into bratz and loved getting this styling head from Santa. Beware though, unlike most of the ""Barbie"" heads that use only water to apply color, this one comes with actual make-up (messy!!). And what's up with the choppy hair? Is the hair designer at the MGA toy factory blind? Anyway, your daughter will love it even if you don't."
5,I have to have this doll!,"This doll is really ,really,really,cool! she is really preety! I like her a lot. She is realy tall and beutiful."
5,Great Product,"I have never used higher end hair products until I recently cut my hair. The salon I went to pushes Redken, but I purchased this product on Amazon because it was more affordable than expected. The product works great with my hair. I have medium thick, coarse hair that with the new haircut requires me to flat iron it a lot to get the look I want. This product seems to keep my hair looking healthy and shiny and repairs the damage done by the flat iron. It makes my hair feel so soft and smooth and also smells really good. Doesn't weight it down or build up over time like some of the grocery store hair products. Overall a great product for distressed, damaged hair."
5,Love It!,"I went into my Salon Superstore with dry, damaged, fly-away hair and the stylist recommended Redken Extreme shampoo and conditioner. It was amazing! My hair is much smoother and although there is a small amount of static occasionally, I am so pleased with it. I shampoo, use just a small amount of conditioner (quarter-size), blow dry and go."
3,Short And Sweet,"This is sufficient for one's need, but not at all dramatic or inspirational like the movies about Saint Francis and Saint Clare. Since very little is known about the saints, what is presented must satisfy in want of anything else."
2,"Not a ""Dream"" I want...","I Have Rheumatoid Arthritis, and purchased this cream looking for a little relief from shoulder pain. I have applied this cream 2 nights in a row, to my shoulder and both knees. I have seen absolutely no relief at all. Very disappointed. Save your money."
5,Australian Dream,I thought it was expensive but the results were well worth it. I used it on both knees and the results were amazing. Nothing I have used prior to this has given me any relief. A great product in my opinion.
3,Get Free Samples First,"Go to the Austrailian Dream website and get your two free samples before spending money on this. I got my samples in about three days. I tried it and it seemed to help my knees a little for a couple of hours, but the pain came back too soon for me to spend the kind of money they want for this stuff. I give them three stars because of their willingness to share their product for free before selling it to me. Try it out for yourself--for free. It might work for you. You've got nothing to lose."
3,Australian Dream Cream is OK!,"Used this product for arthritis. It was ok but didn't last long. I used the entire jar and didn't send it back. Would I recomend it again?? No, try BioFreeze. You may find it works better."
1,"very disappointed, no relief from pain","I purchased this item after reading the reviews for the gel DMSO. I decided to get both items because I really needed some relief from pre-arthritis pain especially after my exercise program. Australian Cream offered no relief from my swollen ankle, the cream itself feels nice and creamy, hardly no smell...but I brought this for pain relief, and it failed to do the job. However the gel DMSO works, but SMELLS very very badly....to the point I might stop using it. I wished this would have work."
3,Okay fighter.,"It's the fighter to get on the Cube since that's all they have. However if you own an Xbox, get this on there and play it online, and if you own a PS2 get Guilty Gear X2, the best 2d fighter ever made."
1,A major waste of money.,"To start it off, don't buy it, heck, don't even rent it. The graphics are horrible for what a Gamecube can crank out. And all of these different grooves to fight in, whats with that? Also, the gameplay gets really repedative. All of the characters look [strange] and there moves stink! If I could I would give it a negative 5 stars. If you want a good game get Def Jam Vendetta, it even has 4 player action. But, don't waste your money on this load of [fluff]."
1,From Worse To Worse,"Listen, if you actually grew up liking street fighter games, this one will sadly disappoint you. I bought it, played it for about 10 minutes before i gave up in disgust of how bad it was. From cheesy SNES graphics, to deplorable ""Grooves"" this is one game you can go without...end of story."
2,A TRUE STORY...,"I PURCHASED THIS GAME BECAUSE I LOVE THE FIGHTING GAME GENRE. BUT TO MY SURPRISE IT WAS NOTHING I HADN'T PLAYED BEFORE YEARS AGO. I LOVE STREET FIGHTER, BUT ENOUGH ALREADY! NOT A SINGLE NEW FIGHTER WAS INTRODUCED. 2-D IS FINE, BUT SOME 3-D FEATURES WOULD BE NICE. IT IS ALSO HARD TO PLAY A FIGHTING GAME THAT REQUIRERS YOU TO KEEP BOTH THUMBS ON TWO JOY STICKS. I LIKE USING BUTTONS TO CREATE COMBOS. THE BUTTONS ARE ALMOST UNUSED FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER IN THE FIGHTING GAME GENRE, AND WHILE CHANGE IS GOOD.. IF IT ISN'T BROKE DON'T FIX IT. MY REVIEW HAS A HAPPY ENDING ATLEAST FOR ME, NOT THE GAME. I PAYED [X] FOR THIS GAME. I RECEIVED [X] CREDIT FOR IT AT A LOCAL TRADE IN GAME STORE. THE USED PRICE FOR ""SUPER MONKEY BALL"" JUST HAPPENED TO BE [X] SO I MADE AN EVEN TRADE FOR A SLIGHTLY OLDER.. BUT BETTER GAME. I ENDED UP PATTING MYSELF ON THE BACK."
3,Okay fighting crossover,"Uusally, I really enjoy crossover media. I like crossover films, TV specials, and most of all, video games. Which is why I expected to like this game more than I did. I mean, it was okay. The fighting was fine, the combos were okay and all, but the game felt kinda boring. This is no Super Smash Bros. Brawl.The graphics, for one thing, are pretty retro. To be honest, too retro for me. The graphics just don't really compare to games like Tekken or King of Fighters. The graphics remind me of GBA video games.The plot is very, very simplistic and yawn-worthy. I expected something else, not just a random tournament where the winner gets a prize or whatever.As for the roster, I am shocked that no Mega Man characters made it. I mean, wow. Capcom really messed that up.I guess for fighting game buffs, this game will still be worth it, but I think the general players should stick away."
5,Classic Chic,ROdgers&Edwards&Crew give up the Grooves on this set.Le Freak was The Jam as was I want your Love.The Guitar&Bass in the Pocket Groove is The Genius of Nile Rodgers&Bernard Edwards.Savoir Faire is a Nice Instrumental Piece that woudln't sound out of Place on a Brothers Johnson Disc or a George Benson disc.Great Musicianship&Production.
5,C'est stylish,"This elegant and innovative album took the clubs and the charts by storm in 1978 at the height of the disco boom. Of course the two hit singles Le Freak and I Want Your Love are the most immediately appealing tracks, both as pop and as dance music. My other favorites include Savoir Faire with its jazzy arrangement and the soulful At Last I Am Free. C'est Chic perfectly encapsulates the mood of an era. Together with Grace Jones'Portfolio, Donna Summer'sBad Girls, Boney M'sLove for Saleand theSaturday Night Feversoundtrack, it is one of the best disco albums of all time. The Chic movement includedNorma JeanandSister Sledge, both worth your time if you like classy dance music. Read all about the Rodgers/Edwards legacy inEverybody Dance: Chic and The Politics of Discoby Daryl Easlea."
2,a major step back for Adidas,"I've sworn by Adidas for years. Tennis shoes, trail runners, and basketball shoes. They always fit perfect and last forever...until I bought the T7 ATS Trail Shoe. My very first run yielded a small tear in the fragile mesh covering the toes. The very next run resulted in the sole of the shoe beginning to peal off near the ball of the foot. I was shocked. I've been able to stop the damage, at least temporarily, with shoe goo, but I have a pair of Adidas Estes trail runners almost 10 years old that have needed no mending. I've put them through the paces in Africa twice and back to Colorado. I may put these new T7's out to pasture and go back to my old ones. Don't buy these. They look good but may tear from looking at them too hard."
3,comfortable but not durable,"this was one of the most comfortable pair of running shoes i've ever owned, but they were not durable...i'm nit very hard on shoes, but these ripped very easily and the glue on the soles did not hold up."
4,One of Mary Pope Osbourne's best,"I am a 7 year old boy who really likes this series. This was one of the best Magic Tree House Merlin Missions there is. In the Merlin Missions, Jack and Annie have to go on a mission to save Camelot, a mythical city. We still don't know why they have to save the city. Summer of the Sea Serpent was definately the best, but if you are just starting to read the Magic Tree House books, you should either start at the beginning, or start with Christmas at Camelot, which is the first of the Merlin Missions."
1,Too Basic,im a second grader and i dont like it cause its too basic and is to short for 10 bucks. If u like the series go check out at library but do not buy it.
1,"The ""leakproof PVC liner"" leaked!","I purchased this bag to hold my baby's bottles in order to take to and from his day care. Apprently it is not as ""leakproof"" as its details state. After about three months of use, the bottles leaked and somehow the formula got underneath the ""leakproof PVC liner"" without anyway of getting the smelly rotten formula out. I had to throw the bag away."
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"The ""Leak Proof Liner"" is not ""leak proof."" If you are keeping a bottle in your cooler, there WILL come a day when one of the bottles will leak. And when it does, the fluid will leak behind the liner and through the bottom of the tote onto whatever surface you have it placed on. Plus, the cooler does not keep items cool as long as it says it should. In the case of this product, it truly is false advertising. There are better products out there! Please don't waste your money on a Baby Innovations/California Innovations product!"
5,Top Notch quality and functionality,"After trying no fewer than three different brands and styles of food and bottle totes for our two babies, this one finally won out as THE BEST! It's worth every cent. Here's why: The design is compact yet roomy ~ you will easily fit 4 full size bottles (even the chunky styled ones by Playtex) plus 6 jars of baby food, utencils, bib, and ice pack. There is a handy shoulder strap if you choose to hook onto a stroller, otherwise the little handle is all you need to tote it along. The inside has a special anti-microbacterial coating which, so far, has provided us with ""smelly free"" cleanings after a long day out. Even if milk spills into the compartment, there is no odor when you open the bag. A quick wipe makes it good as new. We have no criticisms on this item so put it on your list and give one to an expectant parent -- they'll thank you a million times!"
4,Great bag,"I find this bag to be sturdy and very practical. Fits everything I need for my daughter's meal when we go out, and is easy to clean too. However, the ice pack provided takes up a lot of space. I use the ones made by Especially For Baby, which are much slimmer. I also wish the two compartments were equal in size (ie. same as the larger side)."
4,Great bag but had to reattach handle,"We are still using our bag, but it was very disappointing that our handle split within the first week and I had to resew it back together. Inspect this closely! Other than that this has been a great bag and we are giving it daily use. Unlike others, it has remained odor free."
5,Wonderful bag!,I love this bag. I can go all day long with just a ice pack that comes with the bag and have cold milk. The black bag is nice but this one hold 4 bottles and also on the other side holds food or other bottles.
3,Trying again,"I'm going to be returning the one we currently have for a new one because the first time we used the warming puch, it leaked and made a huge mess in the bag. Later a few weeks ago after some juice had accumulated under the clear liner that the inner liner was not sown all the way. So I'll be returning it for another one, hopefully it will be better a second time around."
4,pretty good,I bought this for travel and I like it but I wish the compartments were a little bigger. I could only fit one Avent bottle in the side. My baby will turn one year in about 8 weeks so she will be on cold milk and I imagine I will use it more with ice packs than with warm formula. I noticed that it doesn't hold heat very well. The black one that came with my Similac diaper bag from the hospital is the only one that has kept her bottles warm.
3,not like a fianna,this bratz looks very pretty but she is fianna she shoundnot have blond hair she shound have brown because i havefunk out fianna wild life safari fianna and flash back fever fianna and they all have brown hair!
4,Are you sure this is fianna,"I am not trying to be races but what the .... fianna looks like cloe fianna is darker than this ugly look""in"" thang and why goth who would want to be goth, they should love god not dislike him. i wouldn't get this doll if i was you but if ya want to that ok."
2,DOSNT LOOK LIKE A FIANNA,ITS A NICE DOLL BUT I STILL DONT GET Y SHE SO BLONDE SHE LOOKS MORE LIKE CLOE THEN A FIANNA N A FIANNA IS DARKER THEN THAT N I DONT RECOMMED THIS ONE BECAUSE THIER R MORE FIANNA THAT R MUCH BETTER THEN THIS ONE N I WAS SUPRISED THAT THEY DONT HVE A CLOE IN THIS LINE IS THE FRIST TIME EVER CUZE CLOE IS BEEN IN ALL THE BRATZ LINE SO YEA THATS ALL HOPE IT HELPS N GO TO THE WEBSITE BRATZMANIA.TK OK
1,innaproprite/bad choice toy for a child,"This is clearly a bad choice toy to give a child.Faults: inspires plain/flat out gothic behavior, inspires evil, dark/scary looking features, slutty, innapropriate.Never in my life would i let a child play this toy."
5,GOTHIC ROCK HERITAGE + A GREAT DOLL,"Why do people always insult goths and make-up like a bad thing, and to the 12 year old acting like she was a mom already, *lol*, no one cares about a girl in your class at school who wears make-up. How last century are you. I have a lot of friends who are gothic and they actualy have a good taste! So there! Black and white stripes are so in and black clothes totaly rock. And what does this doll teach kids, nothing, but it's not supposed too. It doesn't teach kids to wear make-up or turn gothic. The whole point of the doll is to be gothic, and what kind of 12 year old acts like a mom?(unless they are on! LOL!)See ya,Frankie xxx"
3,Can somebody tell me?,Can someone tell me when bratz went goth? seriusly they are so pretty i can't understand this line of bratz dolls.
2,Shes Ok,"Well i like an fianna doll but in this collection she kinda shocked me cuz Fianna is a half caste girl, but this doll of her she is pure white. Her lips are painted a nicew colour and her hair is super soft.Im love all my bratz dolls but im not a big fan of this fianna. That been the reason why i havent purchased the other MISNIGHT DANCES dollsI dont thik thier sayin OH BE A GOTH AND KILL URSELF like sum of u ppl r sayin its just a fashion statement i dunno wt u guys think ""goth"" is but ill tell u 1 of my mates is a goth n she dont worship satan or attempt suicide everyngiht she likes the music and the clothes. So when all opf uz r sayin these dolls are goths well ur rong there jus dolls in gothic clothes n i think thers nothing wrong with it.PeaceEmma xxxxxxxxxxxx"
5,Gosh People,"people who said that this doll looked gothic and wore too much makeup have problems. i'm 14 years old and still play with dolls. just because some one wears black doesn't mean that they are goth. besides no one is goth any more most people are something called punk. she is not wearing too much makeup. if you can read it says she is going out to a dance party. if you go out to dance your not going to go with zero make up, and no one cares about 'this girl in your class that wears too much makeup' they care about the doll. i have this doll and luv her. anyone who likes her will like the bratz princess twiinz."
4,like her,I haven't got her but i think she's cool! The goth theme is good because no other dolls have a goth theme. Goths are people to you know! Dolls don't have to be princesses or ballarinas. I'm not goth but this doll is aswome! I'm 12 and i have about 10 bratz.
5,A must have!,I highly recommend this book to anyone who works with children. I've been working with kids on and off from 1992 from infants to elementary school and this book is a must have. It provides techniques to set limits and consequences while giving the child the ownership of their behavior. Children learn to be responsible for their choices and their dignity is maintained.
5,Excellent Product & Prompt Delivery,This item was exactly as described in the item description. It was in the original packaging and is in excellent condition. I am very satisfied and I highly recommend this seller and product to everyone. This is an excellent book for teachers by an excellent author!
1,I never got the book,"I hear it is a great book. I ordered it in November, and now it is mid January. Sure wish I had it by now."
4,Suspense,I was so angry at the perpetrator of this killer-party.IIIII would never have let him get away with it.This sounds strange but you will have to read the book to know what Im on about.
3,great begining bad ending,"When I started reading it I couldn't put it down. The book was great after Lila's party got started and wierd things started hapining. I was disapointed when I got to the last 2 or 3 chapters. I wouldn't hae bought it if I new that it would end thils way, but it was one the spookiest SVU thrillers I've read."
