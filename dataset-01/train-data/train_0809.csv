5,Brings back memories,"I didn't see this movie until recently, even though it had been out for some time. We TIVO'D it because we thought it might be fun to watch. What a really great story full of good acting, and really super new music that very much captures the sound and spirit of early 60's pop/rock. I went right out and ordered the soundtrack because I loved the music so much. It was the sound I loved and it was new music, nobody writes music that has this 60's sound and lyrics anymore. Its a fun trip back to a different time, before Vietnam, drugs, and politics stripped all of the innocence away. I would recommend it!"
4,Great Soundtrack,This is a great CD! The music is wonderful and the movie is just fantastic! Check it out. Very pleasantly surprising!
4,Great Movie ! Great Soundtrack !,If you like songs from early 60's you will enjoy this CD!It's impossible to disconnect the movie from the songs !Remember the great times !
4,Better than you might think,"Most of this album is actually pretty good. Typically I only skip past a couple of songs when listening to it, and a few of the songs are, what I would term, ""excellent."" The vocal arrangements are strong, and the musicianship is solid.Enjoy,Jim"
5,W.O.W.,"Ok, first of all, Tom Hanks is HOT in this movie.Second, i saw this at a change over weekend at my school and I loved it!!!! I need this CD!!!!!!!!!!"
5,That Thing You Do,I loved the movie and it was partially because of the soundtrack which I feel is excellent. A good buy.
4,Fun!,"I didn't realize until I got the soundtrack that all of the songs in the film were written for the film, I thought that the title song was the only original. It turns out I was wrong! The music on this disc is great, I especially love ""Little Wild One"" and the alternate version of ""That Thing You Do"". It's a really sweet soundtrack, really cheerful. Good buy!"
4,I've been floored with a touch of nostalgia,"I really tried to avoid this movie with a vengance when it first came out. However, I gave into it, and found that it's really a wonderful movie. I love all the songs on here, but I was rather disappointed that ""My Name Is Sparticus"" isn't on here. It's a rather nice jazz selection, and to not include it here is sacriligous. However, they do include the other song here that the Wonders perform live. It's included at the end of the movie. A rather tasty rocker. I only ask that ""Sparticus"" be included."
4,Do That Thing You Do,Great buy for all who enjoyed the movie and the music from the movie. I especially like the Wonders' hits.
5,"Great music but, Where is ""I am Spartacus""?","The album was great. I was disappointed at the fact that the drum solo ""I am Spartacus"" was not not on the album."
5,Great soundtrack to a great movie!,"This is a great soundtrack to a great movie! Our entire family has enjoyed That Thing You Do! for years. We've also appreciated the soundtrack, and finally got around to obtaining it. What a bunch of great, upbeat, 60's era songs!"
2,Bummer CD,"I am 58 years old and ""The Wonders"" DVD just put fire back in my blood. I love the DVD. A few weeks later i bought the CD and was let down.....Most of the songs are great,except the oneders/wonders tracks.They ARE NOT the same production as played in the movie. The last track (live version) was close.It actually sounded like ""Shades"" was playing the drums and the singers were the same from the movie.It would have been nice to have the song ""Spartacus"" with shades and del on the CD but it was not. I saw Spartacus at Graumans Chinese Theater so i could relate to ""I Am Spartacus"" as i imagine others who have seen the epic would too.To sum it up save your money. The oneders/wonders versions on this CD ARE NOT THE SAME!"
5,Bobby Darin - They don't make them like that anymore!,"I really love this CD, it is actually the 2nd Bobby Darin CD that I purchased. He sings clearly, with enthusiam, and a great big band sound in the background. You hear these trumpets, and a piano, things that some of today's bands just don't use. It is really great. When I am in a bad mood, all I need is a little Bobby Darin music to fix that problem."
5,TUNES STUCK IN MY HEAD!,"I came across two tunes on this cd that I didn't remember from years past and I kept playing the little blurbs provided here. They stuck in my head and I wanted to hear more, hence the purchase of this great cd. The tunes that nabbed me were ""Lovin' You"" and ""Irresistable You"" and the complete version of them was NO disappointment. I just don't tire of them.What a talent Bobby Darin was and he would love knowing he is still wowing his audience and entertaining us today."
5,More Talented and Versatile then Elvis and Sinatra combined!,"If you're new to Bobby Darin, as I was just a year ago, this CD is the perfect introduction to his awe-inspiring talent. It demonstrates how he refused to stay confined to one genre of music, as so many of his show business peers did at the time. Whether you are into early rock 'n' roll, swing, jazz, country-western, or folk, this CD has something on it to satisfy everyone, although personally it's hard for me to choose my favorite. I just wish that he had scored more hit singles after 1967, which is when he started to dabble heavily in folk and late 60s socially conscious rock and roll. Bobby Darin was a genius, and this CD never fails to perk my spirits up. Thank you Mr. Darin and God bless you. May your music never stop playing!"
1,Bobby Darin Greatest Hits,I have tried to play this CD on several players and it does not load.The players don't recognize it and won't play it.I AM RETURNING IT FOR A FULL REFUND AND I WILL NOT BUY FROM YOU AGAIN.
3,something missing,"sounded alright, all the hits were there, but something missing. Don't listen to it much as I expecting to.........I guess I was looking for a better mix than the one presented on this greatest hits......."
5,A Must,"Alongside Sinatra, Ella, Ray Charles, Nat King Cole, and others, Bobby Darin is an absolute must in everyone's discotheque."
5,Bobby Darren,Loved this album. Brought back a lot of memories and was great to drive in the car with.
3,Bobby Darin Hits,"This CD has two excellent songs, Mack the Knife and Over the Sea. The remaining songs, you need to be a real Bobby Darin fan to love.I wish the two great songs were first as opposed to in the middle.But, for the price, it's a good listen."
3,Bobby Darin,"I was disappointed in the quality of some of the recordings. For instance, Mack The Knife sounds like it was recorded recently. While Beyond the Sea sounds as if it were recorded by someone with a cassette recorder in 1960."
4,Mack the Knife,"I ordered this for my cousin's birthday gift because his favorite song is Mack the Knife. I didn't listen to this Hits Collection, but I know that I do like Bobby's version - even better that Frank Sinatra's, if you can believe that!"
5,Nice,"Man's got a sweet voice. I'm pleased w the music this cd provides. Just got it today so I was able to listen to it during my drive to work and back. Im not familiar w Bobby Darin, I just fell in love w his song If I were a Carpenter, hence the purchase. The rest of cd is like alittle gem! Great find!"
1,JUNK!,"The screw holes on these hinges are swagged out on the wrong side (not as pictured) making them virtually impossible to use on any application that I know of. Finish is poor, metal stamping is poor. If you are looking for sewing machine cabinet hinges, go someplace else."
2,Be Careful!,"If you have sensitive skin, be careful! I tried it two nights ago and it felt great! My back never felt better! Unfortunately, I woke up with a severe rash on my back. This morning the rash spread to my entire back! I am on a cream and steroids now to get rid of the mess. I learned my lesson - I hope you learn from me! I know several people who use it and are just fine. If you decide to buy it, start with a tiny patch of skin to see how your skin reacts to it."
2,so-so,This product was recommended to me but I don't think it was what I really needed. It is probably a good product when used where it's supposed to be used.Thank you.
4,Excellent product,"I use this product regularly on my horse. It smells great, is easy to apply without wasting too much, and definitely has a therapeutic effect on my hands after I've applied it to my horse. I wish it cost a bit less, but I think it's worth the investment."
4,Grace,"""Grace"" is the captivating tale of a young woman who risks her life to save the lives of passengers of the Forfarshire who are stranded on a rock not far from her family's lighthouse. ""Grace"" is based on the true story of Grace Darling, and Ms Walsh does a tremendous job with filling in details and adding feeling to her story. Although Ms Walsh's additions are fictional, they are also extremely realistic, and I am sure much the same as Grace's were. Ms Walsh also captures her audience and keeps them in the palm of her hand throughout the story."
5,A great book for ages 10 on!,"I read this book for a school project, and once I'd read the 1st chapter I couldn't put it down! The story is set in 1838, in England. Grace Darling is a 22 year old woman living with her parents in Longstone Lighthouse. One day Grace spots a wreck of the ""Forfarshire,"" despite the troublesome storm Grace abd her father set out to save the recks survivors. Little did they know that the road after this one act of heroism wouldn't be smooth. It would be bumpy filled with fame, fortune, but many acts of jealousy and misunderstandings! This book is a excellent example showing money is not everything! A great read!!"
1,Book doesn't live up to title,"Before you buy, you should know that this publication is only 10 pages long, and aside from giving some general information about why and why not to use the 360 degree evaluation system, never actually provides good advice on how to construct a program."
5,Tish,"Excellent item, the dvd arrived quite early, i was happy with the cost of the item, and very impressed with how much by boys learnt from the dvd."
3,Blue's Clues,This is a great type for pre school and this a happy little dog with a lot of personality. Irish Lassy 1-17-12
5,Side Table Drawer gets treated like a piece of furniture!,But all's well that ends well in this charming musical. My 16 month old loves to wiggle to it. If I have CNN on she points at the tv and goes 'ah ah ah ah' until I put this dvd on instead.
5,A truly great movie,Classic feel good kids movie. Music is great and children learn how important it is to involve everyone so no one feels left out
2,Blue's Big Disappointment,"Slow pacing and poorly written songs plague this overly long Blue's Clues production. It failed to hold my two year old's attention and I really can't blame her. The weak plot about the characters preparing a backyard play never goes anywhere and the songs are completely forgetable. Unless your child is a diehard Blue's Clues fanatic, I would not recommend this DVD."
2,Too much singing and a bit boring,"I love watching Blue's Clues with my son. This video is like one long episode of Blue's Clues to me except there's too much singing. My son got bored with the video after 45 minutes into it. Normally, his eyes is stuck to the TV until Blue's Clues is over. With this video, I thought it might be the same, but it's not."
1,What a disappointment,"I couldn't believe that this was supposed to be a movie about music. I was so disappointed! It taught very little substantive about music. With all the resources they had at their disposal and all the kids tuned in to see Blue teaching them about music, it saddens me that this is the best they came up with. My kids learned tons about music from the far lower-budget Trebellina DVD, which they love. Alas, I fear nothing will compare to that."
1,Blues Clues Clueless,I bought this item thinking that my two year old would enjoy it and as an alternative to her thinking that Clifford the Big Red Dog was the only thing out there to watch. Both of us ended up disappointed in the lame antic and songs in this movie. She wasn't impressed and neither was I.
1,Get on with the show already!!,"I bought this video for my daughter because she enjoys the show so much and I was very dissapointed. The whole movie practically revolves around Steve and his friends getting ready to do a show,him composing a ""Lame"" song with the help of some animated notes, and just seemed to go on and on. By the time it finally got to the part when they're going to put on their ""musical"" weall couldn't care less. My daughter and her friends were so bored they left the room, and I ended up turning it off on frustration. Don't waste your money. Stick with the short shows.They're much less tedious, and more apropriate for toddlers with short attention spans. --C. Petersen"
4,Great voices,This Blue's Clues video is awesome! I am 13 and I love watching it with my little cousins and the kids I baby-sit for. Matt Ballinger (from Dream Street)'s voice is in this and it is awesome. That is the reason why I got this for the kids to watch. Matt rocks and so does Blue!
5,Love it!,"My daughter is enthralled with this video! She is three and a half and hardly anything keeps her attention as well as this movie does. The story moves fairly quickly, the lessons are easy to understand, and Ray Charles is great!"
4,One of my Son's Favorites,"Kids will love this movie if they already like Blue's Clues. As a parent, I felt it dragged for about 30 minutes in the middle, but when it comes to a movie for my son, his reaction is what really matters most."
5,My 18mo Old Loves It!,"My 18mo. old son is in love with Blues's Clues, and adores Blue's Big Musical! He knows several songs from the video and has learned a great deal from it. I would suggest purchasing this video to any parent."
3,Nice to have Ray Charles in it,I purchesed this for my 3 yrs old daughter... she liked it but didnt actually LOVE it like she loves Barney.. its seems boring sometimes... but the music is good... having Ray Charles is GREAT... and it teaches some musical notes which is good... but in the middle of the movie it has some distortion.. it was scratched since I got it !! :( and that bothers my daughter and makes her angry...
4,A exhilirating fun-filled experience!,"I bought this DVD for my one and one-half year old niece. I did'nt know at first that my niece is into Blues clues! when the dvd tape arrives, my niece was so excited and eager to view the tape, over and over again! When she wakes up in the morning first thing she says to her mom ""Blues Clues"",even stayed up a couple of nights late to watch blues clues again..and again and again! It is so educational, fun-filled and lots of mysteries for her. I spoke with my sister recently and she thanked me a lot for it!I can't wait to hear my niece's reaction when she receives some more books and tapes & dvds I'll be sending her again.Thistapes and videos are just mind entertaining for my smart niece! Keep up the good work!!! KUDOS!!!"
1,Not that good,"This is supposed to be a travel guide, but is actually more of a disguised advertisement for the book and movie, ""Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil."" Within the first 118 pages, the authors make no fewer than 45 references to the story, its characters and places, and glamorization of their alternative lifestyle.If you've never been to Savannah, this book will lead you to the conclusion that it was nothing prior to the book and movie. Or that all of its history exists only as a backdrop for the book. Save your money."
4,Savannah guide book,Recently did a girls trip - the guide was very helpful. We planned lots of our trip prior to our arrival - restaurant suggestions were particularly helpful.
4,Very helpful,"This book gives a nice review of Savannah, from history, to where to stay, what do do, where to eat. It's very compact and will be easy for us to carry along on our trip next week to Savannah."
4,Good One,It's really gud. This is my first camcorder and I am very happy with it. It's easy to use. Only backdraw it has is with 30 mins limit. But it is managable infornt of other features like 25x zoom and gud quality. And ofcourse it's sony.
2,Purchase with an open mind,"I purchased this product in cream form when it was on special periodical delivery. I meant to continue the periodical delivery but unfortunately decided against it. The reason for me to try this product out was because my foot doctor prescribed it to me when I had my toe nail removed due to nail fungus. The prescription was, however, a higher dose than what you can buy unprescribed. However, the prescription would not come under any insurance so take note that you still will have to pay it out of you own pocket. Anyway, since I have another toe nail starting to have the same looks of the fungus I had before I bought this product (even though the dose was less.)to avoid removal of the nail. After finishing two 2 oz bottles there is still no improvement. The nail did look normal when the cream is applied but looks terrible again after the cream wears off. The cream did NOT CURE the problem, it simply makes the nail look normal for as long as the cream is on it."
3,Not as pictured,"This cooler looks to be well made. Buyers should note that it does not include the brass barbed fittings as pictured. It instead comes with -6AN male thread ends. I contacted amazon about this, and they told me to contact Moroso, who told me the item pictured is the old style... the new style only comes with the -6AN threaded ends. I ended up purchasing a set of these (Derale 98200 -6AN Female x 3/8"" AN Swivel Hose Barb Fitting) from Amazon to run it inline to my power steering pump (which keeps blowing on my taco)... looking back I probably would have just purchased an all in one kit (cooler, fittings, hose etc.) instead of having to piece it all together to save time and $$.. Again, the cooler itself looks to be very well made... but did not come as pictured or described."
4,Pretty decent units,"These work pretty well. Two of them are currently holding up my kayak (60 lb; so about 30 lb each) in a home-made storage rig. They're not recommended for anything too heavy duty or life-critical, but I think they'd likely hold 75-100 lbs. without difficulty (bending or breaking). Gates work easily; on one of the four I got the gate was bent slightly but still closed securely. Overall, pretty good for non-critical applications and a lot more compact - and cheaper - than using my climbing carabiners."
2,No title.,"The read was somewhat dissapointing because it did not describe the wonderment of the cottages. I have been to Newport several times and was looking forward to reliving the grandure. It did not happen for me. Hardly any rich details. For my taste there should have been more about such items as the mosiac on the logia ceiling. Also, there was the same lack of character development. I can't tell you what the heroine even looks like."
2,NOT HAPPY,"WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THE SIZE OF THE PRODUCT--PICTURE MAKES SIZE OF PRODUCT SEEM LARGER AND IT WAS ACTUALLY VERY VERY SMALL!!I DID NOT RETURN JUST FOR THE HASSLE AND MAYBE MY FAULT FOR NOT ASKING QUESTIONS, WAS FOR DAUGHTER IN LAW WHO COLLECTS KOALA BEAR ITEMS AND THEN TO TOP IT OFF--AFTER MY DISAPPOINTMENT FOUND SHE ALREADY HAS ONE JUST LIKE IT!"
2,Not what I expected.,"Wonderful voice, no doubt about that. But after listening to her newer work, I expected a little more jazzy collection. Still a big fan though, especially of her collaboration with Pat Metheny, a must have!"
1,Overpriced and poor design,"I am very unhappy with this product. It was overpriced and poor quality, design, and instructions. It lack features for a product that costs this much. I rarely purchase Sony products because this is usually the case, but the only other comparable product had so many poor reviews. I wish I could return it."
1,Bad purchase,"Sorry I bought it. Even after exchanging it because the first one was damaged, it never worked. Played CDs fine, just never could get it to record. Instruction booklet not very clear either."
3,good budget tape deck,"I don't think it really makes a lot of sense to buy some really expensive piece of equipment to play 30 year old tapes. They are going to sound pretty bad regardless. So this deck does the trick. It is inexpensive, and seems to be a sturdy reliable deck. As others have stated though, the omission of a remote control is kind of shocking, and unforgiveable in this day and age."
5,sony tcwe475 dual cassette player/recorder,It is a very nice player/recorder and it does a fine job for me. It is very good quality. I like the black color very much.
4,For the price,"Easy to operate, however, sound quality is really just decent. However, well worth the price and it does have some other qualities which I liked."
4,Sony Cassette Player,"I owned an older model of this and it has lasted for 15+ years. The belts finally stretched out and would have problems with the mechanism. I was very happy with this model then and this one seems to have some improvement in the logic system. I wish there was an easier way to get at the belts so they could be changed by the user, but I don't know of any tape drives that have easy to change belts. It would have cost me as much to replace the belts as it was to buy another one. This is a good addition to anyone that still has cassette tapes to listen to."
1,"nothing but troubleI bought one of the machine in november 2006, and very soon afterward, it began running the tape forward fo","I bought one of these decks in november 2006, and one week later I had to exchange it for another because the relays misfunctioned, so that instead of rewinding, it ran the tape forward for two sequences. I got another, same problem. When I got the third one and it started doing it, I decided to get it repaired in Loredo tx. they repaired one side, then the other one started doing it. I got that repaired in July 2007, and, now it is starting it again. The relays are unreliable, and your tapes can get snarled because it might wind forward instead of rewinding, and when you use the music search to go backward to a previous song, it could also go forward. The machine makes great recordings and my tapes sound great, but it has a crappy noisy design."
1,Bad sound: please don't buy,"Hi,Ok, the specs sound quite impressive. But i would trust my ears more than the printed material. I have hooked it on to a Nad c320 bee with polk 6i. I am sorry, my friends, it sounds REALLY bad. Needless to say, I checked the amp/speaker set up with a cd player. Sound was pretty neat. I plugged in a Sennheiser headphone to the sony tcwe475, and the sound was still bad.I guess we need to pass it through an equalizer, 'coz there are no sound controlls in the machine.I assure you, it sounds duller than the simplest mini component you can think of.I bought it 'coz i trusted the specs and it was recommended by this guy in circuit-city, which brings me to another point: Always trust your ears more than what others say."
4,TCWE475 Sony Dual Cassette Player/Recorder,"Sound quality is good on the transfers from cassette to cassette. A bit difficult to use in the beginning, but gets easier as one keeps using the features. Editing is not the greatest asset of this unit, since there are split second ""dropouts"" at the splices. But for my purposes, it is good enough. Another reason why I purchased this item is that my old Sony dual cassette player (a 20 year old model) is slowly giving up and the cost of repairs would exceed buying a new machine."
4,It's ok,"I was confused with the fast forward/backward, and play side A/B buttons at first because the arrows signs looked identical,and located on top of each other. It was quite easy to press a wrong button. The manual helped. It was quite noisy when I pressed the Stop, Fast foward/backward, Play and Record buttons. The tape was quiet during playback, and the sound quality was very clear. Too bad that I could only record in Deck B. I liked dual decks recording."
5,Exactly what I needed,"I'm digitizing old cassettes. This is exactly what I needed.It has an option to switch to the other side and continue playing without removing the cassette, so I can digitize a whole cassette in one session.Another option is to switch to the other cassette and continue playing so I can digitize two cassettes.I'm feeding the output into iMic into my mac using Audacity to record.I'm very happy with the sound quality. It is old cassettes so my expectation wasn't too high."
4,Great Quality - Remote Control Lacking,"First off, I love the sound quality that this Sony tape deck produces, it truly is amazing!! I bought this for my father, and he has HUNDREDS of old cassettes, most of which are nearly over 30 years old and had lost their sound quality on other players, but sounds just like a digital CD. Truly amazing sound!!!This unit does not come with a remote control, but one is available for purchase separately. I did not need to buy one, since I have a universal remote control that I was able to program. After serious customization on my Logitech Harmony 880 remote, I was able to get almost all features setup (I even programmed some macros for the stop commands to control both decks, etc...) The only thing that really disappointed me was that the power cannot be controlled by the remote control, you must physically toggle the power on/off from the unit. Not a huge deal, but just something to be noted.GREAT SOUND BY SONY!"
5,The Best One Out There,I bought this three years a go to record tapes and i always use it. never once i cleaned the tape heads. the sound qualitiy is ok i am getting a SONY STR-DG500 AS A NEW RECIEVER. I HIGHLY reccemend this.
5,Great Replacement,"I replaced my 19 years old Technics cassette deck (which stopped working) with this Sony. It's okay with no remote for me. I started to play old cassette tapes and record them on the Teac CD recorder. I was able to do the setup because I have a 19 years old Technics detachable equalizer with extra inputs. To my surprise the recording was clean although the cassettes were 19 years old also. Thank You Sony, the quality is still there."
5,cute idea,"I bought this for my teen daughter who has a plain silver ipod and wanted something different. It fit perfectly on the ipod and I have even removed it twice to try to put it on better. It took a few tries to get it lined up perfectly and to seal it since it ends on a side of the ipod, but other than this it was very easy to apply and is still on a month later...My daughter loves it!!"
4,Great deal,"Great quality for asking price. I would have given 5 stars if cable wasn't slightly kinked at a small section near at one of the ends. Otherwise, hard to beat this price for this quality and length."
3,Gotta get better than this.....,"I bought this for my 3 and 4 year old girls and they were so excited to get it-I myself am a Hair Salon owner so they were so anxious to ""Copy"" mommy. The problem is the station always topples over, the chair for the sink does not lounge all the way back so the dolls head is hovering above the sink, and the hair extensions are impossible to keep on the doll with the clips that are supplied-aside from the fact that they immediately become a huge hairball after a few uses. It is cute..... and I do like the detail of all the accessories included, but Mattel could find a better way to make all these Barbie things a bit less wobbly so my kids can breathe without the thing falling over just from the air coming out of their bodies."
2,Im shocked!,i really don't know what to say about this toy. is is so flimsy and these magical accecories ARE SO tiny. oh and christie and barbie and treresea mast really hate each other for two reasons. i christin this toy salon bowling mayhem! i tried to get christie to keep the spiders oops i mean hair extentions to stay on her head but they caught on to teresea's hand which pulled her and knocked out barbie and splling water then knocking the playset down.this reallly seams like war or wrestiling! and they also hate one another for bothering to come to this cheap salon! wihch ever doll decided to come her probably got beat up! i hate this toy! (...)
4,Great behind the scenes footage!,"Before watching this video, I was a little hesitate in that it would be a glorification of Kelly, placing him on a surf God pedestal. We know he's very, very, very good, but there's a point where you get enough of someone. Wrong. I was blown away by ""Letting Go"" how it illustrated Kelly's thought process, how he analyzed himself and his opponents (mainly Irons). It was facinating to see such a superstar talk about himself and what he went through these past couple of years.Of course theres great surfing footage that has never been seen before, both freesurfing and in contests.Letting Go is surely worth checking out. You can also view on www.unionondemand.com Enjoy"
5,I love this pot!,"I never thought of this pot as anything too special until I sauteed onions in it the other night. It's been a long time since I've had a pot that let onions cook to a transparency instead of burning them. Maintained perfect heat throughout and my onions cooked beautifully! It's the best eight bucks I ever spent.Also, I must say I didn't have the problem of the handles overheating that other people seemed to have. Perhaps it's because the burner I used was slightly smaller than the pot itself. By the time I was done cooking (about 15 minutes) the handles were still cool enough that I didn't need a pot holder to take it off the heat."
3,handles all very hot,"the handles of this saucepan are very hot when cooking, so be careful not to be hurt by the heat."
4,perfect for Black Beans,"Nothing fancy here, a nice covered pan, in a size that is great for small tasks. solid construction."
1,"false statement, lid handle and pot handles are burning hot, not cool!!!","This is the worst pot I have ever bought. The lid handle and the pot handles are so bad. They are as hot as my sauce in the pot. How in the world does the company expect people to use this product if I can't even handle the pot with my bare hands?! If you want to test the thickness of your skin, go for this pot. Otherwise, stay away from this pot!!"
1,Returned Product,Product was too small. Be sure you know what 3 qts is before you have to pay for return shipping.
4,Really like this saucepan,"For the money it's a really good saucepan and I'm looking to buy another bigger one. I use this mostly for boiling pasta and vegtables, it's just the right size for two people. I love the looks of it too. It's not heavy either. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is that it doesn't have stay cool handles, so it's not perfect ;)"
5,after the ball,As good as the best fiction. Hard to believe the story hadn't been told before - and wonderful reading it now. A must read for anyone who loves American history and the building of corporate America - and reading about the amazing (and glamorous)people who lived through that period. A must read - and bound to be a classic!
4,Like a CNN broadcast from hell.,"This is one 'action/drama' that won't insult your intelligence. It is superbly crafted as well as viscerally intense. Every character is finely drawn and believable. As is so often the case, if you liked the movie, you'll love the book."
5,The best book I have ever read.,Takes you to another planet. Can't beat the experience. Richard Price is a GREAT writer
2,Ultimately unsatisfying,"Like everybody else, I have to use the word ""gritty"" too to describe the realism and the colourful, detailed descriptions of the drug dealers. However, I am siding with the minority here who found the book boring. If a book for you must be more than about character, then I think you will also find this book tedious because the development of the plot is so slow as to be almost irrelevant. The characters are all unappealing and blithely accept the roles in which life has cast them seemingly without benefit of self-reflection or humanity. Maybe that's the way it is but it makes it difficult to empathise or care what happens to them."
2,"nice body, pretty face--but no soul","This was a well-written book, with lively description, well developed characters and an interesting story. So why was I bored to tears? And why, out of the thousands of books I've read in my life, did this book not spark enough interest for me to finish it? Perhaps the characters were simply not engaging enough. Maybe the story became stagnant and bogged down with too much description and detail. Can't quite put a finger on it."
2,Not a favorite,I found this book to be a very difficult read and gave up about half way through. I found the characters uninteresting and the pace far to slow. Given the reviews of the book I was hopeful that it would improve with each chapter but at the half way mark I decided that I read for enjoyment and I was not enjoying this book. Thus I would not recommend this book.
2,Not good,"I didn't like it. The book is boring. As I read it, I felt like I was running without leaving the same spot. Had to put it down.Maybe the movie is better, but it hardly is"
3,NOT the New Orleans band,"This is by the U.K. band NOT the New Orleans band.Don't be fooled , this is NOT Cajun anything !"
1,water spots,"yesterday 3/08/09 was the 1st time I took shoes out of box and I was highly disappointed. I just looked at them in the plastic when they arrived and was pleased, but on yesterday when I got ready to put them on I saw all the spots! there was nothing I could do because they were for the outfit that was to be worn. I don't think anyone noticed but I was aware"
3,"Love the company, but this does not smell like pines","Awesome, awesome company, but pine does not seem to transfer in this incense- it's too smoky a medium. Their other products I have are outstanding! Love them enough that I will try other products. I think I just don't like incense..."
2,Double waste of time................,"I was very disappointed, after watching Double Jeopardy. The movie is about Libby Parsons(Ashley Judd) who is framed for her husband's murder. While in prison Libby finds out her husband is alive. She is eventually paroled and begins to seek out the whereabouts of husband. Libby's parole officer (Jones) feels Parson cannot be trusted. Parsons eventually eludes Jones and goes across the country looking for evidence while Jones is hot on the trail. This movie had all the elements of the Fugitive. Tommy Lee Jones acting was subpar. The entire storyline was very predictable and hard to believe. Save your money!"
4,Some Credibility Gaps But A Fun Fugitive-Type Tale,"*** This comment may contain spoilers ***With two really good lead actors and people I like to watch (Tommy Lee Jones and Ashley Judd) plus an on-the-run-""Fugitive""-type story, I expected a lot. I wasn't disappointed, either, although it's a bit hokey.This is a very intense, involving story, a la the above-mentioned ""The Fugitive,"" except this time it's a woman chasing down her ex-husband who set her up for murder. Once again, we see Jones in his familiar role of chasing down the supposed-criminal.As interesting as the story is, there are some credibility gaps such as why Jones didn't have a picture of the ex-husband in the first place or the always-annoying hesitation-before-shooting at the end which saves the ""good guy""...and a few other things like that which are unrealistic.However, clichés aside, overall it's very entertaining and always fun to watch no matter how many times I see it. Both Judd and Jones are excellent in these kind of roles."
2,Great Premise...,"...Terrible movie. Ashley Judd holds your attention but the script has a lot of holes, Jones is playing his ""Fugitive"" role again as he has too many times before. There are a few well done action scenes, but that is about it...Otherwise this is one of the worst of its kind. Do not buy this film. There are too many other better films in this genre."
2,a real turkey!,"The movie is not at all beleivable; there is no real explanation as to how the husband gets away, leaving his wife covered in blood. Further, the ""conviction"" is not satisfactorily explained, and it is unclear what she is charged with. Then miraculously, after seven years, she locates her husband, and after he changed his name, identity. The plot, the characters, the whole thing just makes no sense. One of the worst movies I've seen."
3,not one of my favorite,the movie is ok but not one of my favorite ones.I havenot watched it very many times. Have other ones I like better.
4,Interesting Entertainment,"The plot was unusual and the actors were fun to watch, especially Tommy Lee Jones. An especially evil husband made for a perfect villain."
5,Double Jeopardy,Definitely a classic movie that I could watch again and again. Would not only reccomend watching...... also a must have for a collector.
2,Not recommended,"This was a long way to go to get to see mother and son reunite. So many scenes that would make a great cartoon. For instance, leave the convict in the car with the keys? why do that? he may as well left the keys to the handcuffs also, if he did it would have lessened the torture of watching it. Judd should focus on other types of movies. she's not a super hero. The only saving grace was that Tommy Lee Jones was in it."
4,Entertaining,"DOUBLE JEOPARDY may seem a bit far-fetched in places, but Judd's performance make it watchable and entertaining. Judd plays a woman found guilty of murdering her husband only to discover six years on that he is in fact alive! Tommy Lee Jones plays her parole officer and is also entertaining to watch. There are a number of tense moments which help keep the film at a watchable pace (eg. the car going overboard, being chased by the police, looking for her son in the graveyard, ending up in a coffin etc etc. It's quite rare for me to want to see a film twice, but this is one of those films you can watch again and again. I was happy to add it to my library, and it is reasonably priced too.Australia's Bruce Beresford directed this film, and I would say he has done a very impressive job. The DVD includes a small featurette on the making which is enjoyable to watch. Beresford explains why he filmed some scenes a certain way (eg. Judd's anguish at discovering her husband is still alive)."
3,An Thriller with Fantastic Acting Performances,"Highly recommended if you want to see the outstanding performances of great actors Tommy Lee Jones and Ashley Judd. They play their roles with conviction and determination. Ashley Judd is a women who is framed for the death of her husband - by the very same husband who is still very much alive. When she realizes she can't be convicted for the same murder twice (hence the title Double Jeopardy), she is off for revenge. The plot is somewhat average, but still a triller that will keep your interest until the very end."
3,A thriller that's not very thrilling.,"This is an enjoyable movie, especially if you like Ashley Judd. Unfortunately, it was billed as a thriller, but there is actually very little suspense. The storyline was too predicatable for that. As the viewer, I could easily figure out what would happen next. This ruins any chance for developing any serious amount of suspense. This is where the movie falls flat.Other than that, I enjoyed watching it. The characters were engaging and fun to watch. The storyline itself is interesting (although, I think they could have done a lot more with the premise). The climax is satisfying aside from a few minor details...If you like Ashley Judd, you'll probably like this film. Just don't go into it expecting an intense thriller. An enjoyable film that had the potential to be a lot better."
3,glorified tv movie,"It is formulaic. It is predictable. Tommy Lee Jones does the ""Fugitive"" for the bazillionth time. But it's just plain fun. The movie is meant to be cathartic. Don't come expecting Citizen Kane, because, let's be honest, this was pure pulp. The wonderful woman is framed by a louse for a husband and she's going to go after him. (and he's officially dead and already convicted for the crime, so she has double-jeopardy protection) How silly, but it I enjoyed it."
1,Something must be done about Ashely Judd,"If this woman is allowed to make another movie, then it will be confirmed: there is no justice in this world. I mean really- I can't be the only one who has noticed that this woman can't act. It is absolutely jaw-dropping that some casting director saw this lady and said, ""Now HERE is an actress that we need to have in a major Hollywood production!"" I'm not an overly emotional person, but it's almost enough to make you sit down and cry, isn't it? Ashely, stop while you are pathetically behind."
4,Double Jeopardy,"Good Movie, I highly recommened this. Action, intense, I know it isn't true but sometimes you just wish."
3,Ashley Judd is good! But the movie is not!,It is in this movie that I got to know Ashley. she is the spotlight in it. It is a pity that Tommy Lee Jones did'nt give me a deep impression. So it is only a normal thriller with a little qualified actor.
2,Maybe....,"....Billy Wilder's death will stimulate the studios into re-releasing the original, which should have been done anyway prior to the re-release of this remake. I think the jerks programming the releases of the DVDs should be aware that there are (not a few) customers who prefer to wait for the real thing and won't buy the ""ersatz"" they are so inclined to produce first."
1,A waste of time,"The plot may be OK & Tommy Lee Jones is always interesting, but there is a great big void at the centre of this movie and the name of the void is Ashley Judd. As an actor, she doesn't hold the viewer's attention or create any interest. Who cares if her husband set her up? Who cares if she spends several years in prison for a crime she didn't commit? It doesn't seem to bother her, so why should it matter to me?Given a real actor like Ellen Barkin the movie might be worth at least a rental fee, but not with the present female lead.Give this one a pass & watch Sea of Love again."
3,The Fugitive lives on,"This movie doesn't try to trick you into thinking it's not in connection to The Fugitive. It is an entirely different movie, but you will notice the connection right away. Ashly Judd plays a woman accused of murdering her wealthy husband. Leaving her son behind, she goes to prison depressed. While trying to regain contact with her son, she realizes her late husband is not late at all, and is living in a small southern town. Told she cannot be charged with the same crime twice, she waits for until her parol to break loose and do the job she was so wrongly charged for. Tommy Lee Jones and Ashley Judd are two great actors, and is a fun ride to watch. Please have and open mind and dont be critical. After all, movies should be enjoyed not picked at...enjoy it."
2,Youre getting sleepy very sleepy,Although Judd is shagareffic this movie was very.It is Markie Post lifetimeish if you are a chick the bad dialogue and superweak plot wont derail you.If you are guy just picture ashley judd nake the whole movie believe me you will need to if yawanna last through this one
2,Nothing Special,"Double Jeopardy's action scenes are lack-luster, as are the uninspiring characters. Since the movie itself is predictable, there's no point to watch it. Just another film with big name actors to lure your money into their pockets. Nothing special."
1,Triple Jeopardy,"The ""third"" jeopardy is encountered by anyone foolish enough to invest in this video. I love TL Jones, but his talents were wasted here. The plot is ludicrous, the acting is mediocre, and the legal premise on which the entire movie is based is inaccurate. (Check out Ashley's beautifully manicured fingernails when she's supposedly working in the prison laundry!)"
4,Absolutely Awesome!,Double Jeopardy is an Excellent movie. I think it's one of the best movies that Ashley Judd has done. I give credit to Tommy Lee Jones on his role as well. It's worth seeing and worth the money.
2,Functional by the numbers joiner of dots film,"A passable time filler, which joins the dots nicely. Within half anhour, we've had the supposed murder, trial, incarceration and releaseinto the community on parole. No point wasting any more time on allthat say I.A quick summary of the plot: Ashley Judd is framed forthe murder of her husband, who disappears from their boat and leavinga lot of blood. ....The problem with this film is that it seems to be running onsome very fuzzy logic. The whole ""Double Jeopardy"" principlethat everyone quotes.... I'mno lawyer but even to me that sounds highly unlikely.....But then, this is one of those films that yougo to see that you don't think too hard and it moves painlesslyenough. Every part of the film is done as quickly and functionally aspossible. Tommy Lee Jones delivers no less than you'd expect playinghimself and Ashley Judd is always a pleasure to watch."
2,Watch the trailer,Just watch the trailer. It says everything about it and anything else about this film is nothing special. An overdone genre and predictably cheesy. Freeze frame for Ashly judd naked is the only thing worth buying this DVD for.
2,good idea but not for a full movie,the idea has merit and could have been greattly entertaining the only problem is that I can tell you the whole movie in two sentences it is just not enough for a movie yet it is still a intriging idea
2,"Nice story, not watchable more than twice though!","In all, this is a nice to watch film. It kinda reminds the Tommy Lee Jones classics The Fugitive and US Marshals, but Judd's interesting quest to find her betraying husband keeps us up to pace, really eager to see what she'll do when she finds him! Or will Jones find her first? So, in all, it's a good film, but both the Fugitive and US Marshals rate better than this one!"
2,a hesitating o.k.,I have watsched the movie last evening and I am still not sure what to think about it. But more than a hesitating o.k. it is sure not. Maybe my problem lies within the american law system. How can you convict someone for murder (or what else) if you haven't even found the body of the victim? A judge in germany would simply laugh at the public prosecutor if he would try to do this. If I deside to not bother with this any longer the film still has a big problem. It has no action where it should have some and it lacks thrill where you could make use of some. So what else should I say: I have the movie and I'll make the best of it.
3,Double Jeopardy,"This is one of those movies that I really liked in the theater. However, something is lost on the small screen. Ashley Judd is fine, and and so is Tommy Lee Jones, however, the extra features on the Dvd don't make up for the movie. Some movies just need the big screen."
3,"""You're worth a million bucks to me!""","Ashley Judd does a wonderful job of being the perfect ""taken care of"" mom. Tommy Lee Jones doesn't let us down either, he does what comes natural to him and that's track down the bad guy, or girl whichever it may be. Libby Parsons gets a quick education while in prison that changes her life forever, and anyone else's life that she happens to touch. Once you've gotten into this movie it sort of let's you down because you see the end before it gets there....Watch it or Movie of the week? Watch it."
4,Great movie.....Great Acting,"Ashley Judd gives a stunning performance as Libby in this movie. You never knew what she was going to do next. This movie definetely kept me interested. I just loved the part where she called Angela and found out that Nick was still avlive. If you haven't seen this movie yet, go rent it."
2,A Disappointment,"This movie had an absolutly fantastic story line. BUT, this movie did not live up to its story. Ashley Judd was pretty good and the raged wrongly-convicted mother. Tommy Lee Jones didn't have a very big part. It was very unrealistic at times. Jones always knows exactly where in the country Judd's character would be. This is a fun movie, but don't expect anything special."
3,"Not too bad, but sure not as good as it could have been","This movie had a pretty good premise, but the acting was bad, BAD. Tommy Lee Jones did as good as could be expected (he's always at least good, and usually my absolute favorite). But he was totally wasted in this role. Ashley Judd, on the other hand was embarrassing to watch. She had one and only one expression on her face for 99% of the movie. I didn't like her or her character at all. Much of this movie was painfully unbelievable (what was she going to do with her kid, anyway? bring him back to jail with her?), but it was worth watching.With better direction, a better actress in Judd's role, and an expanded role for Tommy Lee Jones, this movie could have been really something."
4,A Solid Thriller,"Double Jeopardy is a fun thriller starring Ashley Judd and Tommy Lee Jones. The plot is interesting. Judd is convicted of murdering her husband and is sent to prison. However, the husband faked his death and has run off with Judd's child and her former friend. Judd eventually gets out of prison and starts tracking her husband down; under the law, she cannot be convicted of killing him twice.There are many things to like about Double Jeopardy. Judd does well as the heroine. There is some beautiful cinematography. There is also several good action scenes. Double Jeopardy will keep you interested throughout its 105 minutes.I thought that the movie had a few flaws. Jones is an excellent actor, but he is largely wasted in this film; the script simply doesn't do enough to develop his character. Also, the ending of the film is very predictable; I wish the screenwriter had come up with something more original.Double Jeopardy is a good, solid thriller."
3,Entertaining but chic,"Double JeopardyActual Review: **1/2 [out of four stars]'Double Jeopardy' did not live up to its trailer. The film is very mellow for the most part and there is not any suspense. I suggest for those who have not seen this movie and want to to still not see this movie. It is entertaining but there are more entertaining films. It is perfectly fine for kids to see this film. I do not know why on earth it was rated R.Janet Maslin did not like this movie at all and said that she found the premise of it to be unreal and unexciting.Roger Ebert gave it two and a half like me and said it was somewhat entertaining but really a waste of your time.'Double Jeopardy' was MPAA Rated R for language, a scene of sexuality and some violence."
2,A forgettable thriller,"Double Jeopardy isn't particularly bad or good, it's just kind of there. While watching it I kept wanting to reach for the remote to see if anything else was on ... and then remembered that I'd actually rented it.The movie wants to be ""The Fugative"" or any the other ""man/woman wrongly accussed"" flicks, but it can't live up to the real thrills that ""The Fugative"" had, and Ashley Judd simply can't hold a movie like Harrison Ford. Tommy Lee Jones is competent, but not nearly as compelling as he was in that earlier movie.The plot ranges from tolerable to utterly implausible, combines with the lackluster acting to create a movie destined to be show again and again at 3 p.m. on Sunday afternoons on the ""Million Dollar Movie""."
3,Glossy Sentimental Action Yarn!,"This 'action' movie was made by the same director that did 'Driving Miss Daisy' and 'Tender Mercies', so you can't really blame it for being overly sentimental. But the biggest flaw here is the plot that is extremely predictable and full of plot holes. Ashley Judd is a very talented actress, but her range is not evident here, Tommy Lee Jones is in familiar ground, playing a role he's already played twice. Enjoyable escapist fun if you're not too demanding. From a scale of 1-10 I give this movie a 6!"
5,Excellent movie!,"I think that this is a great movie for several reasons. One, Tommy Lee Jones and Ashley Judd work very well together. Two, the plot is really good. Three, although the movie is a bit predictable, the way that things happen are unpredictable. Finally, the action is pretty good. I have watched this movie several times and I still really enjoy it."
3,"Enjoyable - in a very light, uninvolved kind of way","The trailers looked pretty good and after missing it in about 3 countries that I was in, finally got to watch it on an airplane. Not too bad for a basic action movie. Not enrapturing by any means, but as something to watch once, it was entertaining enough. I don't think that I will go so far as to buy the DVD though."
2,One big Cliché,I found this movie to be a big cliché. It stole from every thriller ever made. The actors did a pretty good job but Tommy Lee Jones is always playing the same charcter. It can get a bit tiresome. The script as I said is full of clichés but strangely enough the movie was an okay entertainment if you can stand all the clichés.
3,Entertaining...somewhat,"I rented this movie last night and also rented two others with the exact same plot, so it is far from original. The best part of this movie was Ashley Judds acting. It was fantastic. Poor Tommy....I usually love him in movies, but his character was a bore...and he even looked like he was bored playing it. I enjoyed the movie to a certain degree. I would say it was worth the money spent on renting it."
4,Go Ashley!!,"This movie is definitely not original because I have definitely saw this same story before but, I really liked this movie. Ashley Judd and Tommy Lee Jones both put on a riveting performance in ""Double Jeopardy"". Ashley goes to jail for killing her husband who actually faked his death to take her son, the insurance money, and her best friend whom he was having an affair with. While she was in jail she then discovers what he has done, and then there's time for revenge. That's where that old Double Jeopardy law comes in, How can you kill somebody that's already dead?, and besides you can't be tried twice for the same murder. I guess that's the part her husband didn't think about. I think Ashley's character was not only clever but, she did some quick thinking to get away from her parole officer played by Tommy Lee Jones because he was definitely right on her heels at every turn. I would definitely give this movie 2 thumbs up!."
3,Is Tommy Lee Jones getting pigeonholed?,"This movie reads an awfull lot like _The Fugitive_ as rewritten by Gloria Steinam. We even get a drunk and divorced version of Sam Gerrard, played ironically enough by Tommy Lee Jones.So here is the story. Innocent woman convicted of murdering her husband. While in jail she finds out that her husband is still alive, and has taken their son. Upon getting out this woman, played by Ashley Judd, decides to find her husband and get her son back. In her way is her parole officer, played by Tommy Lee Jones.Folks there are defintely some places where you are going to have to suspend your disbelief. The first being how incredibly easy it was for her to find her husband. If it was that easy, then how in the world did the police not find him and release her?If you can get by the above as well as a few others this is not a bad movie. It's no _Fugitive_ but it's not bad."
3,"The trailer showed most of the movie,DVD lacks features!","If you've seen this movie and read the review of fine!The trailer for ""Double Jeapordy"" told the viewers the entire story! As for the DVD itself all you get is scene access,trailer and behind the camrea(which basically tells everyone the whole movie! ) I wish Paramount would start puttinf extras like commentey, pan/sca &widescreen,production notes etc.. that Universal,New Line and Warner Bros does to name a few ! My advice is if want this DVD is rent it first before you buy it! Other than that it's ""The Fugitive 3"" with Tommy Lee Jones in his same old role from that movie and Ashley Judd as the fugitive! If you live in the state of Washington, this movie shows us some very beautiful areas of that wonderful state!"
1,Worst Film Ever,Not only did they get the concept of double jeopardy wrong - Ashley Judd's character actually could have been tried as the murder of her husband would not legally have been considered the same crime - but they also made a terrible movie. The ending is a movie cliche that was used to get the writer out of a bind and tie up the lose ends.
4,Double Jeopardy,This is a really good movie! I rented it and was going to keep it! Ashley Judd is an awesome actress. It's hard to tell what Libby (Ashley Judd)will do next. And you never know if Travis (Tommy Lee Jones) will EVER find her. I recommend it to EVERONE!
1,Ridiculous,"OK, so Ashley Judd is very cute and Tommy Lee Jones has showed us more than once that he can play tough cops. Well, you know what? That's no excuse for putting the two of them together with an absolutely lousy script and very bad direction to make this piece of junk. For one thing, there's no suspense at all. The ""action"" scenes are laughable in the worst possible way. Also, Ms. Judd's nude scene is completely unnecessary. You'd think Tommy Lee would have more sense than returning to the SAME character he played in The Fugitive and its sequel just because it rendered him an Oscar nomination the first time around. He could do better than this. So should we. (For more, see Sue Scotese's excellent review, below.)"
5,Barbara,Great item. It was as described. Very fast shipping. Actually I rec'd it before an item I ordered 2 days prior. I highly recommed this seller and I will order from them again very soon.
5,review to keep the buggies away,"I used this insect repellent while I was building a maze for a fundraiser. It really keeped me safe from the misquitoes of southern Mississippi. And it has no nasty chemical smell, like other repellents. It just smells of lemon oil.It is a little oily, but alot goes a very long way."
2,attracts japanese beetles!,"I didn't have very good luck w/ the product. It didn't repel mosquitoes and Japanese beetles started flying into me. Creepy. But if you like Japanese beetles, then this is the product for you."
2,Doesn't work--actually attracted insects to me,"Admittedly, I am one of those people on whom insects, especially mosquitoes and chiggers, love to feast. Even so, regular chemical-based insect repellents such as the lower-DEET content versions of Off work well for me. I tried Burt's Bees repellent as an alternative. What a complete waste of money. Not only did it not repel insects, it actually attracts them to me. I had more bites, more quickly, than wearing no repellent. It's back to DEET-containing products for me. This product is one of several from Burt's Bees that has given me a distrust of the company. (The rash-inducing lettuce soap was the worst; this at least did not make my skin itchy or sore, which is why it gets 2 stars instead of 1.)"
1,stay away from this stuff,"Let me start by saying that I am usually a fan of Burt's Bees products.This herbal insect repellant not only failed at keeping bugs away but actually attracted a swarm of wasps. I was given the choice of using deet or this herbal spray. Not having access to a shower for the night, a few buddies and myself chose to douse ourselves with Burt's juice. Fast forward 5 minutes, a swarm of angry wasps decended upon us like it was the rapture. The only person who escaped unscathed was the one who didn't spray anything. Unfortunately, I was stung over 10 times.Trust your instincts, there are times when all natural is not the way to go."
1,Smells repellent but too OILY,"This stuff has all the repellent herbs/smell in there and it does repeal the bugs but it's so OILY that it's pointless to use it. This one needs to be reformulated using a non-oily base. It might work better as a aromatherapy type oil you burn under a small candle, (which I have done to repel bugs outside.)**UPDATE: I found a great 100% Natural Insect Repellent , non-oily, safe for kids, I use it on the dogs, smells & works fantastic. It's by Herbaria and it's called Citronella Mist. Also repels CHIGGERS."
1,This should be labeled Insect attractant!,"I used this product for the first time tonight. I followed the directions to the letter, and the mosquitoes kept coming. There was no relief until I used ""real bug spray"" with DEET.I filed a report tonight with Rip Off Report - this product does not work and IMHO, is aimed to dupe ""natural"" buyers!!!"
2,Ineffective,"The product smells very nice and is very easy to apply, but it did not seem to repel insects and caused a rash on my arms and a blistery rash on my spouses neck. We won't use it, again."
4,A Natural way to keep the bugs away,"I am ALWAYS the first to get eaten alive by bugs. I was told to try this bug spray since I am pregnant now and shouldn't be using the Off and other chemical bug sprays. I can say that this works just as well as the rest without the horrible smell. It does make you a little oily, but that is a small a price to pay for a bug free night without covering myself in chemicals."
4,Not too bad,"I bought this because I wanted something that was not offensive smelling for my kids to use. I had tried a eucalyptus based oil before but the smell was way too strong. This repellent seems to work pretty well at what its intended for. I only wish that it sprayed the way it should. It does not spray a mist at all, it is a stream and if you are not prepared, will be a huge mess. By the way, it does not come off of painted walls too well. It's not that big of an issue to me, I just use it like I would tanning lotion or something. I apply it on the kids and rub it on their pants and shoes. It is pretty strong smelling, but not nauseating to me, so I would recommend it"
4,It works but it's oily,"The spray is more of a squirt - it does not mist out so I end up putting it in my palm and rubbing it on. I did try and spray it on and ended up with an oil spot on my shirt and shorts.Minus that one annoyance, it does work great."
2,Not good for gardening in Chicago,"I got this bug spray to help ward off the clouds of mosquitoes while gardening in the Chicago suburbs. I wanted something that would keep the bugs away, but not expose my 1 year old to nasites in traditional bug sprays.I don't know if I am using it wrong or there are some crazy bad mosquitoes out here, but I was eaten alive in about 10 minutes about 20 feet from my house. It seems to just not be strong enough to keep everything away.I am giving this 2 stars, because it does work when I'm not out in the garden (i.e. sitting on the deck). I think I just need something stronger for working in the back 40."
4,A Tribute to Syd Barrett,"Certain songs on this Album are reminiscent of tracks on the Pink Floyd Album, Piper At The Gates Of Dawn.I regard it as a tribute, that a band raised in the era of punk, would dare to record certain songs that show influences of Syd Barrett and early Pink Floyd. It is to their credit, that they pull it off so well, when it could have easily been a disaster.I do not understand why Eloise and the other tracks on the 12 inch were not added as extra tracks to this CD, when it was reissued. The original cassette that I had, was able to do it, so why not the reissued CD?I also would recommend Anything as a companion piece and do not understand why it is so hard to find on CD."
2,"Another failed project, but not totally dispensible","I think this and Music For Pleasure were the two black dots on an otherwise awsome carrer for The Damned. While this is the better of the two it still isn't as good as the others. Not really a bad album just not a very great one. It does have its moments ""Is It A Dream"", the Beatle-eske""Grimly Feindish(the best song)"", and ""Trojans"" do have a gothic charm. It feels like they lost the fun element of their earlier efforts and tried to replace it with gloom and sadness. Just imagine the Damned without punk and you'd get this one. Felt like ""13th Floor Vendetta"", ""The Dog"", and ""Life Goes On"" over and over and over again, not really my cup of tea but the more gothic fans will love it."
4,"Not punk, but still enjoyable","I you're used to the original punk Damned music you might be disappointed, but if you are willing to listen to something a little gothier and can still enjoy Dave Vanian's gorgeous voice you might want to check this one out. It is a slow, melodic, very full-bodied musical album with a little gothier tone than the orginal Damned. But at the same token, I don't find this album a downer or too slow to enjoy. It is best listened to as back-ground music. As with most Damend albums, the lyrics are a little annoyingly shallow and silly (so don't listen too hard), but Dave still sounds great and the music is well put together, like always. I am a pretty big early punk fan, but I still enjoy this album, although it's not for everyone."
3,Didn't do the trick,"One of my big toenails has been overrun by fungus. I have applied this stuff faithfully morning and night after washing, just like the instructions say to. My toe looks better overall--the nail is a bit stronger and the skin around it is healthier--but the fungus is still there, taking up just as much of my nail as ever. I'll keep using the stuff, since it does seem to help, but it does not get rid of nail fungus as it claims to."
4,Works well,"I have used this product for a while and it really help one of my toenails, the other infected toenail - not so much. However this is a pinky toe where the nail is curled under. For this product to be efffective you really have to follow the directions and use it twice a day everyday otherwise you may as well not even bother."
4,Not quite as strong as the prescription,"This product worked adequately in keeping foot fungus under control though sometimes I would need to use it three times a day rather than two if the condition flared (ie from wearing infected shoes). Please note, the concentration of Undecylenic acid in this product is 10% here while the prescription strength is 13%."
5,These are the bomb,"For ice, nobody wants buildup to get under the shingles, especially probable here in the mountains of Colorado. This was a great price, shipped quickly, and does the job, of keeping the roof intact."
4,Clips work fine...not needed with de-ice kits,I bought this because I didn't want to be caught short when I installed the ADKS De-icing kit. This was not necessary. The kit comes with plenty of clips.
3,Ice Dams Prevention,"I needed a product to remove the potential for ice-damming in the winter. I looked into commercial grade products and they were very expensive and they needed to be installed by a professional. ""Easy Heat"" provides a solution for the homeowner. It is reasonably priced. However, it is still challenging to install and is designed for occasional use. If you have a chronic ice-damming problem you may want to consider having a commercial grade product installed instead."
5,A serious bible for the serious bible learner,"Being a Christian in Indonesia, the biggest muslim country in the world, I found Dake's Bible (in addition to Scofield's) as ""a good and perfect gift from above"" for the 20th century (today is Dec 30, 2000). I understand that one has to prayerfully ponders and evaluates the doctrines, but I always cherish every single page of this Bible. It strengthens my Christian conviction and make the Bible an awesome ANSWER to all problems. My only hope is that the NIV version will one day be published. English is not my mother tongue and sometimes I struggle to understand the KJV."
5,The bible opened up for me!,"I love Dakes Annotated Reference Bible, once you learn the basics on how to navigate through the scripture with Dakes notes, understanding and revelation explode of the pages. Questions I had were answered and explained. There is a complete set of notes after each book of the bible - the insight into the Word of God is amazing. I have read a lot of commentaries of the Bible and this one is the tops. I do not recommend this bible as a first bible for a new christian - the text is KJV - King James Version and may be hard to understand -(I suggest The Open Bible - New Living Traslation for a first bible) Anyway, as I always read reviews for products I want to buy when on Amazon - I thought I would leave one. Have a BLESSED day!"
4,Almost Forgotten,Sharon Stone wearing Carnaby Street fashion. Not the best film but certainlynot the worst either. Murder with a riddle. A must for Sharon Stone fans.
4,Psychological suspense drama,"This was a great vehicle for Sharon Stone and she plays the part of the disturbed heroine to perfection. Ronnie Cox was chilling as the villain and Michele Phillips convincingly sleazy as the cheating wife. Steve Railsback, playing a dual role as the good guy and the bad twin,turned in his usual good performance with his ""bad guy"" personna excelling as usual. A good suspenseful story that will have you biting your nails - but sweet revenge in the end."
3,came in good time,"The music is beautiful, and it arrived quickly. However, the case was broken inside and out and does not hold the CD in place."
4,Great Courtroom Drama,"Yes, there's Coppolla. And Damon. And De Vito. But the performance to watch is Mary Kay Place. Brilliant. She deserved an Oscar nomination."
5,Wow!,"This is an extraordinary movie.It is a well written, well acted courtroom drama.If you are looking for another excellent movie like this see THE CLIENT,or THE CHAMBER.*****"
2,Can't figure out what all the fuss was about!,"Am I the only one who was disappointed in this movie? Sure, Coppola comes through with taut and interesting direction as usual, but the storylines were completely too ""neat"" for my preferences. Why build up the relationship between Rudy and Kelly, have the violent outcome, and then just say ""Oh, everything's okay. No charges will be pressed."" ?? Why go to the trouble of setting up Great Benefit's lawyers after the bugging was discovered to do nothing about it? Very good acting, even by Mickey Rourke, but I'm glad I didn't waste my money at the theater on this one."
3,one of my favorite court room dramas of all time!!!,john grishams best adaptation of one of his books! but thats because it was directed by the best francis ford coppola!!!dtc#1
3,Not What I Was Expecting,"This is a pretty good movie, but not quite what I was expecting. Lots of this movie centers around court room drama and what centers around the main case. Many people might have heartfelt feelings towards this movie since it deals with a wrongful death claim. I have not read the book, but many people rave at how close to the book this movie is. If you like Grisham or good court-room drama then you will like this movie, while not my favorite of Grisham's work, it is still worth at least one viewing."
3,"Law, weak women and tough men.","I heard the audio tape, before I bought the video. I think that the book is better than the film, although the film is fine. If I should say something that I do not like about this film, it must be that the women come out so weak. The only one that tries to work out something on her own, is the sick boy's mother. She has been fighting for her son's life. Sadly, this is a battle she loses."
3,no truth here?,"Insured people die in the USA without getting the treatment theyare insured to get. Films like this may make some people feelgood, but the facts are that the big law firms win more casesthan they lose. The movie is the blue yonder of wishful thinkingof a guy/ author who makes his money selling popular novels that please people.Giving people hope in the legal system that is stacked against themis probably a cruel thing to do?Poor people continue to die of things rich people live through."
4,very good movie,i saw a few minutes of this movie at a friends and had to finish it once i got home so i ordered it!I am studying law and loved this movie! very reasonable plot.
3,One unforgettable Sequence,"While the Rainmaker is a very decent adaptation of pulp writer John Grisham's novel, Coppola has slyly inserted one of the most subtlely powerful sequences of his career. Watch closely the scene in which Matt Damon places Claire Danes in the hospital bed after he's rescued her from the abusive husband. Look at the shots... Close up of his hands touching her elbows, Close up of his hands grasping her hips/back...All close ups of the intimate touch. It's such a small moment in the story, yet Coppola understands that it is the defining moment in this young romance. A beautiful sequence of shots by one of the masters. Take a second look."
3,Claire Danes,"I must confess I watched this movie only because of Claire Danes, that's one of the best best actresses of her generation. She's also so pretty and sweet, that it makes it worth watching this movie, even if it's not so good."
4,Good Movie!,"I love John Grisham books, and though I've not read the Rainmaker, I do thoroughly enjoy this movie. It's a David and Goliath story about an underprivileged family and a greener than grass lawyer taking on the mega-insurance company. (And believe it or not, I work for an insurance company!) The storyline is great....Matt Damon and Danny Devito compliment each other well in this film. The subplot of Rudy's love interest is a bit more than the movie really needs...I'd be interested to see if that portion exists or how it plays out in the book. Overall though, if you're looking for a nice solid movie, I'd recommend this one!"
4,One of the better Grisham adaptations,"The Bottom Line:Though this version of John Grisham's 'The Rainmaker' benefits from the fact that the book is one of Grisham's best, it cannot be denied that the film resists the temptation to screw things up that strikes so many such adaptations; realizing instead that Mr. Grisham's novels barely need any adapting, Coppola sticks closely to the book's interesting story and produces a film that zips through its 135 minute running length, engages the viewer, and emerges as a pretty decent piece of entertainment.3/4"
5,underrated and understated,"This understated version of the Grisham novel of the same name is a gem. Matt Damon shines and Danny Devito is perfectly cast as the ""paralawyer"". Very well done, perhaps the best of the Grisham movies."
5,I love Grisham movies...,"and this is one of my favorites. Matt Damon does an excellent job. Devito couldn't have done a better job. I love it when he plays a serious/funny situation. He made this movie ease up when the tension got high. If you are looking for a movie that gives justice in the end, this one is for you."
2,"Good cast but shallow, underdeveloped story","There's really not much good about The Rainmaker. The characters are two-dimensional, the storyline predictable, and the whole subplot with the admittedly always-fabulous Claire Danes seems to be stuck in there for either downtime or romance, for it in no way relates to the story. However, as shallow as the characters were, the first-rate cast worked relative wonders with them. If you're a Matt Damon or Claire Danes fan, you might want to check this out; otherwise, just read the book."
2,Average at best,"Read the book, then watch the movie. Then you will get an appreciation of how poorly the movie was produced."
3,Not so dazzling as it could be,"Matt Damon still lights up the movie screen with his incredible talent as an actor, but he couldnt show it all as he was held down by this some-what dull plot. Good movie with great acting and well thought out problem, but slow moving action scenes."
2,Too true to Life,"I read the book when it was first published and then a friend had a son diagnosed with leukemia and went through the same thing as the Mom in the book. Fortunately he had a lot of advocates that pushed him to ignore the insurance company and his son finally found a donor match but it was too late. So I feared that this movie would not be up to the book. My fears were unfounded, the casting was brilliant and I loved this movie, even though it is tough to watch, I still catch it in reruns on the satellite occasionally and ""must watch"". That is how good it is."
2,Ahh...it's all right,"This is the film that proved my theory: Claire Danes is not leading lady material. She is better as a supporting role. Her acting style is repetitious and draggy. Matt Damon was terrific as usual. Too bad they didn't find him a fitting love interest. Danny DeVito is a hoot. There are a lot of famed cameos in the film. I'm not into lawyer films so I found it rather boring and slow at times. If you're into these kinds of films, you may enjoy it."
1,Expected more,"After reading the novel I ran out and rented this movie. I thought that such a great book will also be a great movie... not even close. The movie was did not live up to what I expected, it cut out a lot of what was great about the book and how it built up to the events that took place. My advice to you if you want to see this movie, see it first then read the book, you'll see what I mean."
1,Not at all what was expected,"I am sorry to go against the tide, but had I not read the book, I would have nothing at all good to say about this movie, in this format. It was choppy, disoriented, and failed to develop any of the plot points. It is like a series of promos, loosely glued together, without even a good time line to enable a viewer to determine what has occurred. Since my spouse watched it with me, and has never read the book, we are both convinced that we saw this movie before, and that it was longer, with much more detail. In this version, Birdie and Donnie could have phoned in their parts, as could Ms. Black. Very little in the way of part development for anyone except Danny DeVito, and even that was abridged. Am I wrong? is there not another version out there somewhere?"
1,The Rainmaker,"Since I cannot figure out how to complain about an item, I'm contacting you this way. The Rainmaker was inhcluded in an order of several other DVD's. The first time it was used, it started stalling over and over again. This has happened with other items you've sent me including John Grisham's courtroom slections, and The Sting. These are just examples since there are others.I am concerned about the quality of your DVD products, and it is questionable whether I would use Amazon again."
5,Movie,I had to watch this during a college level class I was taking and it was a great movie to watch and analyze.
3,It's okay.,I am just updating my DVD collection. I have already seen this and read the book. I won't watch it again for a while.
2,An awful lot of flab,"By the time this 2:15 movie is over, I was fidgeting in my shoes because it just seems to drag on without end. Where was the editing? This needed a 30 minute haircut, especially the pedestrian courtroom scenes where absolutely no surprises happen to justify the tedium. Francis Ford Coppola was once a titan, but by 1997 when this bloat job was made, his talent had vanished. I did enjoy some of the acting, especially Jon Voight's shark lawyer. Matt Damon, then unknown, is okay, but not special here. He would do much more with the same-time-frame ""Good Will Hunting."" The plot is standard courtroom fare, and all the characters are stereotypes, including the battered wife, the rumpled clown (Danny DeVito), the wise judge (Danny Glover) and the hard-luck family that wins over the cold hearted insurance company in the end. This movie is the film equivalent of the novel on which it is based: pop junk food."
1,"If you've read the book, the movie will disappoint you","I have not seen the DVD. I have only seen the movie on Belgian TV. This review will review the actual movie, not the DVD and all of its features.I have read the book that John Grisham wrote. And I liked it a lot. The I saw the movie and it disappointed me, even more so when I saw the director was Francis Ford Coppola.What is disappointing in the movie is that although it follows the book fairly closely, a lot of background info that the book gives is absent in the movie, and makes the movie story much more incomprehensible. I doubt if people who have not read the book will fully understand everything that happens in the movie.Danny DeVito was also the wrong actor to cast for the role of Deck Schifflet. DeVito is a great actor, but in this movie he was too much of a goody two shoes person and did not resemble the Deck Schifflet described in the book."
5,Great movie,"This movie was great. It was interesting, had a great plot and Matt Damon was fabulous in it. I think this is going to turn into an alltime favorite."
3,Read the book first,"Would have enjoyed movie more if I hadn't read the book first. Book was terrific, movie left out a lot of important details."
2,Gratuitous rewriting of a superb novel,"Great casting, good courtroom drama.The trouble is that the movie needlessly revises and weakens a superb novel, and I compare the result with the novel. What business did the script-writer have ruining the original?"
3,A letdown after the book,"My feeling after watching this movie, is the classical watch-the-movie-after-reading-the-book conclusion, which is a certain degree of disappointment. The movie skips important details from the book that are important to get under the skin of the characters, and the plot for that matter. On the other hand, after having read the book, I was able to place certain aspects of the movie into a larger context, thereby grasping more of the plot than I would have. I feel my recommendation is a bit of Catch 22-situation; If you have read the book and watch the movie, you will be disappointed by the movie, if you don't read the book first, you will probably miss parts of the plot, and certainly the ""mood"" of the characters."
4,For a Rainy Day,"John Grisham's The Rainmaker marks the return of quality moviemaking in the career of Francis Coppola. In recent years, the grand old man of American cinema has strayed into material far beneath his potent skills. Note the recent Jack or his inane, overwrought take on Bram Stoker's Dracula.You wouldn't think that another Grisham novel would be Coppola's ticket out of the mud, but it is. Maybe he has more of a stake in the project because he also wrote the screenplay. But whatever it is, this tale of a greenhorn lawyer and his quest to do the right thing makes for entertaining, thoughtful drama.The acting in Rainmaker is first-rate. Sure, the faceless corporate bureaucracy is an easy target-it always is in this kind of movie-but the detailed and subtle writing enables the cast to create believable, interesting people."
4,Good Album but not Journey,"I know, it was a solo album and I love ""Oh Sherrie"", but I was so hoping for another Journey album that rocked like ""Frontiers"" and ""Escape"" did. The album is wonderful though. A must have for any Journey/Steve Perry fan. It rocks and also has the ballads too."
3,"remember, this was the 80's",Not bad work for something done in the 80's. Nice to have for the Journey/Steve Perry library.
2,A Journey Into Hell,"Steve Perry, the singer of Journey, is one of the greatest vocalists ever. He sounds very good on the album but the problem is...this is not Journey. Journey knew how to do a slow song, but they also could rock like no one else. This album has a few rocking moments but most of it is a mangled mess of pop balladry. I bought this album solely because of Oh Sherrie. Journey fans will not enjoy this, but if you love Steve that much you will probably enjoy a little of it."
4,4 1/2 stars,"Steve's first solo cd, and his best, is a prelude to Journey's next cd, RAISED ON RADIO (ROR). Journey's last cd was the rockin FRONTIERS, and Steve stepped out with this milder solo effort. ROR would be in the same mold as Perry's STREET TALK.The cd has the classic feel as some Journey songs, with Oh Sherry, Foolish Heart, It's Only Love, and Strung Out, being the songs with the most Journey feel . But also, the cd goes with a blues and motown feel on some of the songs, like She's Mine, Captured By the Moment, and I Believe. Rest of the songs are pretty good too.This sounds just like any Journey cd, little weak on the guitar, Neal is missed, but Steve's voice is as strong as ever."
5,"Street Talk, Steve Perry","Loved Steve Perry on the Journey CD's so tried his singles. Loved them!! He has a fantastic voice range and puts so much feeling into his renditions. I missed him in the 70's and 80's when my kids were listening to him. Now that I'm an old dud, I play his CD's while I'm cooking, cleaning or reading the paper. His songs keep me bouncing."
5,Laser Toner - Afordable at last!,Laser printers are so cheap! But the toners for them made printing a costly action...prior to Xprint Remanufactured Laser Toner cartridges. Thank you for offering this alternative.
3,Not Really....,"If you've been an O'keeffe fan for a long time this book will lack of new and interesting facts about her life and art. It is a ""good"" book, but it works only for people that have just discovered O'keeffe's greatness."
4,New to the Details of O'Keeffe,"Having always been familiar with her work, this book provided me with a good synopsis of her life and her art. The book has a good layout, and a ""tasty"" palette of her art and color to feed on."
4,Non-Profit Primer,"Good book, great illustrations. Very clear. However, if you've been doing corporate accounting for a number of years, this is pretty basic. Better for someone with limited experience. I was hoping for something a little more advanced."
3,Useful for larger not-for-profits finance staff/volunteers,"Useful, relatively easy tor read reference on not-for-profit (NFP) accounting, generally aimed at non-finance/accounting person. Not so useful for an organization using cash accounting methods (versus accrual), common in smaller NFPs. Some good ideas for low-end (i.e., <$50K income/year) NFP BOD members."
1,Very Bad,"i don't like it. it sound so normal, nothing new.. and my friends don't like it too... maybe in Poland sound good, but for USA very poor..."
1,NO!,It doesn't sound good in Poland! Shes hmmm the WORST POLISH SINGER. I think Shazza is better and more natural!!!!!
1,"i don't like it, shound old","I don't really like Natalia album, nothing new, same like other music. She is trying too hard to be like M.C but she doesn't have the voice for it. Sorry Natalia but you need to practice practice and practice a lot to be good.."
5,outstanding examples,"Our family really enjoys watching these movies because they have a great story line and they share the Good News about Jesus in a relevant way using real-life situations. The movies are inspiring and support strong, family values. This purchase was well worth it."
5,Very good,These movies are free actors who want to get the good nature out of them to the public. They are Christians doing the job for God and doing it without pay. They donate all the money to the poor or the church! Very surprising that they can act and serve the Lord with doing so.
1,Amateurish,Concepts are good but the scripting and acting leave a lot to be desired. Very amateurish productions. Save your money.
4,family viewing done well.,"*Fireproof is an awesome movie for married couples, and with the book love dare it can be a most useful tool for helping repair a marage.*Flywheel had a good story line, but was a little slow as for as i am concerned. Worth the watch if you have patience. the filming quality is definately not high budgetted, but again the story line ws well worth it!*Facing the giants was pretty good."
5,Great Movies,These were three movies worth watching and placing in your church library. We recommend them highly. It's unfortunate their not advertised alot. The acting was great.
4,Great Christian family films,"These three films are entertaining, made on a low budget by dedicated Christians. Why can't we see more movies being made like these?Good job!"
1,Fireproof dvd was faulty and could not be washed.,"The fireproof dvd was recommended to me by a friend. I was looking forward to watching it but on arrival, my national postal service, Royal Mail, charged me 12 pounds sterling more to have it retrieved. Watching it was very difficult because a word was repeated about 10-20 times. It was a tedious experience. I endured it for half an hour and gave up.I'm sure it's a brilliant film but the dvd itself was faulty.It was a very bad experience."
5,Great Trio of Family Movies,I got this rather then buying just Fireproof. My family loves them all and we actually have watched Flywheel more than the other two combined.
1,waste of money!!!!,"I bought this book for my 8 year old daughter and I, an intelligent 41 year old woman was unable to make the ""pop-ups"" described. The illustrations were not clear and there were no dimensions or measurements. I am extremely disappointed!!!"
1,Lisa Loeb For the Inane,"Please. Spoilt upper middle - class kid from Centerville, Ohio goes big city with Lis Loeb song stylings. What has this world come to? I fear real music is now dead and buried.Save some money this season and go buy a homless guy a warm cup of joe :)"
3,good for a debut,"this is an excellent album in terms of the production and the instrumentation. the vocals, however, sound hidden and the songs tend to concentrate a little too much on one thread -- wench-done-me-wrong songs. this album could easily be more aptly titled -- songs about getting f*** over. for someone recovering from a relationship gone awry, it's great empathy music. you might find great humor in the song -- ""silver eyelashes"" -- the name of whose subject (a woman) is actually listed in poe's credits. funny way to get back at a former lover. however, this subject tends to get a little old by the end. and the album overall also fails to capture the intensity of Poe's live performances -- which are not to be missed. But, oerall, it's a great start."
2,Not all that,"I bought these pens because my office manager had purchased Foray Retractable Ballpoint pens and they were great! This version of Foray's ballpoint pen, however, is not all that: I have to scribble every time to get the ink going."
4,Upcoming stars,"Great voices, great songs and damn cool name! These guys are upcoming stars, any way you slice it. The song writing is great and so is the musical talent."
4,Counting Toads?,"To me, Dog's Eye View sound a bit like a cross between Counting Crows and Toad the Wet Sprocket (funny that those all have ""animal names""). Not as original (or as good, I must admit) as those bands, but still great melodic rock. Not much to say really, except that this is a very enjoyable album for what it is. I really wish there were still artists making stuff like this.Oh, and you gotta love the line about ""killing that little turd Cupid"" in ""The Trouble with Love"". The first time I heard that I had to rewind and make sure that was really what he said. Anyway...Check this out if you love good melodic rock. You'll probably dig it, I'm sure."
5,Peter Stuart ROCKS!!,"I loved this CD. Too back DEV is not around anymore. For all those who are following Peter Stuart...He's hoping to have a solo album out in January sometime. He has a CD he is selling on his web site with some new songs. In the meantime, we can enjoy the old favorites like this and Happy Nowhere. One of the best bands in the past 10 years!!!"
5,most compliments ever,"This is a rather light fragrance that has unfortunately been discontinued by Calvin Klein. However, I have had co-workers and even complete strangers compliment me on the perfume, asking what it is and where they can buy it. Honestly, someone says something positive about this scent almost every time I wear it and this has been going on for almost ten years. And again, it's a light scent and not very strong--clean and warm--and soft enough to be worn in a medical office. Still searching for the next perfect fragrance to replace this discontinued one!"
4,Crosnier's Sabre Text,The book was written in the early 1950' and was the only comprehensive but easily understood guide to sabre fencing for decades. The introduction of electrical scoring and the various rule changes since the 1990's mean that some technical details are now of limited relevance.The speed of footwork has increased with changes to tactics and the electrical scoring equipment requires some slight adjustments to some of the parry positions shown.The book does provide a good general overview of sabre technique and has some introductory discussion of tactics for different types of opponent.
1,"Skeptical, with a reason","I have been a chiropractor for 12 years, and I still cannot adjust myself, only others. I must go to one of my colleagues to properly analyze and correct my misalignments. How is a lay person, without any formal training, looking at pictures in a book, going to ""be there own chiropractor"" for themselves or their friends and family?. In the book, the author presents some good self-care ideas such as might be found in a yoga book, but just as I would know better than to buy a book called, ""Be Your Own Surgeon"" or ""Be Your Own Architect"" and then give it to a novice friend to work on me or design my home, I know when to call a doctor of chiropractic for safe and satisfying care."
5,Excellent Collection,"I'm really dismayed that this collection is out of print, and I wish that there were another one of similar quality. It's a wonderful book for understanding the slavery debate, and especially for helping to counter the _Gone With the Wind_ view of slavers and slavery. I also found that I saw _Uncle Tom's Cabin_ as a very smart book once I read this collection--Stowe's book carefully replies to every one of the pro-slavery arguments."
3,Nothing special,"I didn't notice any difference from the other Frommer's travel books. If you look for something special the ""Insider"" or ""Off The Beaten Path"" series are probably more useful."
1,So Dum That the Author Left Out About 1/3 of the State!,"I picked up this book before my first trip to visit a friend in Eastern Colorado. I figured that since I was a 'dummie' from the East Coast I could get the inside scoop on Colorado... boy was I wrong!This book leaves out a giant chunk (the Eastern third) of Colorado. How can a book call itself 'Colorado For Dummies' and not include a geographic area in Colorado bigger than New Jersey?If you renamed this book 'The Western Two Thirds of Colorado For Dummies' this would be a more appropriate title.I do not know how well the book describes the rest of the state, however, it has lost all credibility with me for neglecting a third of the state (which happened to be the area I was concerned with). It makes me wonder if the author neglected one third of everything else, too."
1,Political auto-goal,"This is yet another attempt to water down the real cause of the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The reader will conclude that the agressor was not Serbia and Monteneagro, but....some crazy local politicians who succeded in fomanting the heatred after coming to power. Reader is fooled into beleiving that this heatred had nothing to do with previous history, which is full of bloodshed caused by this monsterous project of Greater Serbia. Personal tragedies of these woman are masterfully twisted into illusion that ""we lived like a brothers during Marshall Tito"", who by the way was one of the biggest criminals and dictatiors in the recent history. If I wrote this when this communist Tito was alive, I'd be in the gulag before this message treavelled from my computer to amazon's server. Poor book, full of illusions and lies! Stay away."
4,Anything for money.,"I think I read a much older translation of David Golder. I have a feeling the latest translation is better. This book is not easy to find, as are other Nemirovsky translations.The world we see in this novel is one of money. Although it does bring some initial happiness to poor Golder, it ends up ruining his whole life, his marriage, his businesses, and his relationship to his one and only daughter, Joyce. She loves him only for his money of course, as does Gloria, his wife.It's easy to see real-life parallels of David Golder in our present world - the upper middle-class, celebrity worship, and the general culture. Highly recommended."
5,princess,"i enjoyed this cd, very much. this is my MAN! He has alot of talent in music. he is about to come out with another cd, so everyone check him out real soon! anyone who produces music, or any music label, give him a shout out!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,I paid 1cent for this book--paperback,"21 stories.382 pages.All writtenin 1993.Harrington, Shirley,Kisner,Hoch, F PaulWilson,T Monteleone,Miller, Coyne, Koontzare just a few of theauthors.Fear feeds on its self.Predators lie in wait.Evil waits.You will finish thisbook very quickly. ITIS TOO SHORT.The editors are Gorman andGreenberg.There are NO notes from theeditor and NO intro to thestories like most antholog-ies have. I MISS THAT !My favorites were:Dead Things Dont MoveHardshellSlitValentineSlasherThe Roadside Scalpelbette 62 okc ok"
2,Review of Will you Still Love me If I Don't Win,"I got some good information out of this book once I got to the journaling/exercises. Until then it really made me feel like I was going to screw up my kids and that everything I said or did was going to be either too pressure-inducing for them or too unsupportive! I almost quit reading just because it made me feel bad, but I kept going. I kept telling myself that it couldn't be all THAT bad...and as I said, the journaling/exercises were helpful.I also thought it was very repetative. The same thing was said over and over in about 20 different ways...""you really MUST examine your feelings.""Anyway...I don't think I would recommend the book EXCEPT for the journaling/exercises in the last section."
5,Inspirational CD,"Jaci Velasquez has an amazing voice! She is my favorite female Christian singer, a heck of a lot better than some other people on the radio. The songs can really make you feel better if you're feeling depressed or questioning your faith."
2,Mediocre debut,"A disclaimer-I am a fan of Jaci and have all 5 (so far) of her albums, and have attended two Jaci concerts. That said, Heavenly Place is not Jaci at her best. It was far surpassed by her self-titled album and LLegar a ti. From the start, it is ordinary, nothing new, sounding like everyone else in the Christian pop market. ""Shelter me"" and ""Thief of always"" are good, but that is it."
3,She is post to be a christian,I love her songs think she is great. But if you look at her dressing habits. she wares the most tight clothing and she is post to be a christian. And now i found out that she is on a movie called Chasing Papi that looks realy bad.
4,Heavenly,"An impressive debut from then 16 year old Jaci Velasquez. The fastest selling Christian debut.With a soft, breathy, smoky voice far more mature than her age, the songs range from the Spanish tinged `Lugar Celestial (a heavenly place)', a stunning mid tempo number, the upbeat duet `Shelter', the atmospheric `Baptize me' with it's slow to fast build up, and sound effects, awesome!Then there are the stunning acoustic ballads; Thief of always', `Flower in the rain' and the absolutely brilliant `On my knees', a song about the power of prayer (penned by Nicole C Mullen and covered on her debut CD too).Finally, we have the poppy, upbeat numbers `If this world' and `We can make a difference', a style Jaci continues to incorporate in at least a couple of tracks on each of her CDs.Get this CD!"
5,"Once you go Jaci, you never go back!!!","I'm a teenage christian girl who was always trying to look for christian music that I could relate to, modern music that could lift me up and that I have a great time listening to. HERE IT IS! Jaci Velasquez is what I was looking for. Music for all ages. If her music doesn't get to you her lyrics will. Buy her CD's and you won't regret it!"
5,Outstanding!,"As an agnostic --> athiest, I was intrigued by the question, ""Why would anyone become a priest?"" This book gives a brief glimpse into the possible answers, all of which are very personal and unique."
4,A fascinating look at the growth of vocations,"I found Murphy's book an interesting and in many ways inspiring read. The struggles of the individual seminarians who are profiled here are gripping. Even more compelling is the manner in which these men, of varied backgrounds, approached their prayer lives and developed their own approaches to the challenges of celibacy, the loss of their old lives, etc. I heartily recommend it."
2,Beware of the maps!,"This book was useful for finding hotels, but I was extremely frustrated with its maps. Perhaps I shouldn't have relied on them to find my way around Verona on a scorchingly hot day, but then again, I should have been advised to buy a detailed map once I hit the city. Too few streets were marked and the churches were not well identified. I was so angry that I swore never to buy a Frommer's guide again."
1,"Great Book, Wrong Cover","Ordered and downloaded book through Amazon Kindle to my Ipad, book came over great but the cover isFrommer's Arizona 2010 not Frommer's Northern Italy. Called Amazon support and reported problem weeks ago.NEVER HEARD BACK FROM THEM, WON'T BE ORDERING ANY MORE BOOKS!"
4,Great with one possible problem,"This DVD is very good. Picture quality is excellent, but I did notice one possible problem with the sound in the episode ""Patterns of Force"". About 43 minutes in, when Kirk is trying to get Gill to respond, Kirk slaps Gill, but no slap sound can be heard. I also have this episode on VHS, so I know that there should be a slap sound. There is one other sound problem I noticed 2 minutes later when one of the Nazi guards is banging on the door to the booth where Kirk and Gill are. You don't hear the cound of the banging on the door. That sound is also on the VHS tape, but not the DVD. I have e-mailed Paramount Home Video about this but haven't heard back from them. I would be interested in knowing if anyone else had this same experience."
4,Who wants to pay the govenment any more taxes? I don't!,This book is a great eye opener. I would not have known about the great opportunities that our govenment has provided for everyone. I will always have my Inc. & Grow Rich!Book next to me.
5,A MUST READ!,"This book has completely changed the way I look at, and live my life. It really puts the big picture into perspective."
2,Misinformation mixed with good information,"Some of C.W.Allen's information is correct but some was flat wrong. I read the book at author, Robert Kiyosaki's recommendation (Rich Dad, Poor Dad) and because some of what RK implied was offbase about having your corporation pay for your car, house, etc. As a CPA and twenty year veteran of the tax profession, I was curious to read his authority. Some glaring problems: You cannot hire your kids in your corporation and write off their education. The tax statutes are very specific about greater than 10% owners and their closely related family not being eligible. There are several other items like this that contradict Allen's info. Another dislikable characteristic of the book is that it has several sections entirely written by different authors who very clearly did not review each other's material. Several times they covered the same subject with different detail. How can you buy a book that you can't trust?"
2,Unbelievably disorganized!,"I ordered this book after reading the recommendation in ""Rich Dad, Poor Dad,"" and I was terribly disapointed when it arrived. ""Inc. & Grow Rich"" is the most disorganized book I've ever seen. It's as if the authors just pasted together a series of unrelated presentations -- leaving it to the reader to decipher the important points. I did pick up a couple of new ideas, which is the only reason I didn't rate the book lower. However, I'm now going to have to do some research on my own to find out how to implement them, since the book was too sketchy. To sum it up: save your fifty bucks for something better!"
2,Falling short,"On the positive side, Inc. and Grow Rich did have some very useful information on the advantages of incorporating your business, and other important legal information that will allow people to save money in various aspects of their lives.On the other hand the situations and case studies supplied to demonstrate these concepts were too specific, allowing the author to end the chapter or section with ""to see how this would apply to your situation, contact a CPA"". And while I do see the advantages of going to a CPA to see how the laws apply to my situation, I feel that for price of the book, it could have contained a broader range of case studies to see how the law applies to each one.My advice.. save the fifty bucks for an appointment with a CPA... with or without this book, you'll need one anyway."
2,A bit of a sham......,"I had high expectations of this book due to positive recommendations, but was extremely disappointed upon reading it. I found it to be amazingly disorganized and not very helpful. Save your money look for value elsewhere."
4,Awesome,"This book is full of some great information. Stick with it, it starts off slow and boring before it gets to the infor I was looking for. Then it gets to the point without alot of fluff."
1,Save Your Money & Hire a CPA,"This book is poorly written; creates more questions than answers and is nothing more than a sales pitch for you to hire Sage International to figure it out for you. While I perhaps know better now the questions to ask a CPA in general you're better off hiring a CPA to discuss your particular situation than buying this book. I was very disappointed and now questions Robert Kiyosaki's wisdom in recommending this book.... my guess, he's getting a commission!"
1,Worst educational book I ever read.,"I cannot think of a more poorly written educational book! It was poorly structured (did the authors ever take an english writing class?). Topics didn't follow a logical flow and seemed to come out of nowhere. The book didn't go into any specifics of HOW to do something (even though a review of the table of contents show many chapters and sub-chapters with the title ""How to...""). I was very disappointed and I now have more questions about how to form my business than before. In the end, they tried to convince you to hire the authors to answer all your questions. Then why would one buy the book?"
4,I found it to be a wonderful intro into what is possible,"This book was a great overview of what is possible when creating your business structure. However, you do need to look into some of the specific Internal Revenue Code concerning certain deductions, but the book lists those. In terms of actual ""How-To"", you are referred to ""The Essential Corporation Handbook"" which is why I do penalize the authors as much as some other reviewers. If you do not have a financial backgound, I would definitely enlist the services of a Qualified professional. This book is a great start for the novice."
2,Not impressed.,"Just a quick note on this. I was not impressed with this book at all. It is vague, overly high-level, and after reading it I do not feel confident that I could follow-through in incorporating and taking advantage of the operating and tax benefits provided. It felt more like I was reading a collection of random thoughts on the topic, rather than an in-depth explanation. I was also turned-off by the quality of the book itself. The pages were not clear; more like two sided photo-copies than a published work."
3,Wow- I had NO idea!,"I have seen this book recommended by others, so my roomate bought it and I read it (he's not as motivated I guess!).Ididn't expect this book to be too interesting; I thought it would be totally referential. And after reading ""Own your own Corporation"" which was amazingly DULL, I expected this to be equally dull.INC and GROW RICH is a MUCH better book to read for this topic, and told in plain, simple english. If you are building a business, at some point, you need to decide on a business structure. I firmy believe that INC and GROW RICH will help you."
2,Privo,"These shoes would probably be wonderful if they fit! I ordered 1/2 size larger because I wanted them to workout and they are too large. They hurt my feet because they flop. Otherwise, I think it would be a great shoe."
3,ok ok,"the textbook is just a transcript of the dialogs from the videos there is no grammar in it, no exercises just comprehension questions on the video and some vocab with cartoons there is also realia documents which are for the most part difficult for a beginner; the grammar is all explained briefly in the workbook it could be overwhelming for the beginner as they start right in on a fluent level at a fast speed there is no teacher-talk or beginner talk for the beginner they also bombard you with huge amounts of structure and you do not know which you should memorize and which to just passively learn; it is tough."
2,Pretty much a waste of money,Each chapter is only about 4 pages long and the workbook is generally more helpful than the text. My advice is to avoid buying the book because it's a waste of money and there is such little written that it hardly seems worth the cost. Spend your money on the French in Action workbook.
4,Part one of a two; for the TV series of the same.,"Updated, but great, companion textbook to the wonderful public TV language show of the same. Just 52 episodes and you'll be on your way to speaking French. One of the easiest and better language courses available for free on PBS. Also published under the same title is the hardcover edition of these two parts in one book. Pick whichever you like - they're identical; two seperate books for lighter carrying or one complete edition for convenience."
3,Great album. Terrible mastering,"Captain Sensible's second solo album ""The Power Of Love"" is filled with catchy new wave/pop songs with a touch of psychedelia. Favourites include ""Glad It's All Over"", ""Stop The World"" & ""I'm A Spider"" (all of which were released as singles) . Actually the whole album is solid though I'd say his first LP ""Women and Captains First"" is a bit better. Some of the bonus tracks are great but not all are essential. This album really deserves 4 and a half stars, however, I find the mastering on this Cherry Red reissue to be terrible and thus I have rated it only 3 stars. This music is supposed to be very dynamic but the mastering is so compressed and loud that it is simply unlistenable if you are listening at higher levels. The vinyl of this album is very dynamic, warm and rich and unfortunately with this CD, the music sounds harsh and ""digital"". Pick up the vinyl LP and you will be in for a real treat."
2,Allure Is All Played Out,"This CD did not meet my expectations. There are a few good tracks which include:""All Cried Out"", ""Head Over Heals"", ""Mama Said"", and ""Give You All I Got"". They added rap artists such as Nas and LL Cool J in an effort to enhance the quality, but it just wasn't enough. They can sing, but need some better, more interesting lyrics and producers. I suggest you buy the single, ""All Cried Out"", but leave the CD alone. PEACE!!"
2,bad song choices,"The album lacks good songs. It is plain boring. The Voices are nice but that's all there is. And don't forget that""All cried out"" is originally a Lisa Lisa & cold jam song - so it's just a cover song."
4,R&B sensations,"This album is what true R&B is all about!These four gifted women all have beautiful voices, that are only complimented by the original, soft rythmic music. With help from such huge stars as MARIAH CAREY, and Mary J. Blige, the writing on this album is nothing short of spectacular. Also contibuting to this album is rap superstar LL Cool J (on the great track 'No Question'), Nas, and Raekwon. Highlights on the album include the songs 'Last Chance', 'The Story', and the huge hit 'All cried Out (featuring 112)'.This is one album R&B lovers should NOT pass up!Ryan Barrowman"
1,I took it back..,"I had the album and it was horrible. I took it back and got a refund. I looked in the used section a month later and saw about 10 copies of this album there (some were still unopened!). That should tell you how horrible this album is. Don't make the same mistake that I did. I didn't even buy the album (I got it as a present). If you like ""All Cried Out,"" buy the single or request it on a radio station, don't waste your cash on this trash."
1,A Total Washout!,"I don't know who thought that Allure's version of ""All Cried Out"" is the best remake that there is. Don't get me wrong tho-Allure do have some beautiful voices that do some slamming harmony- but them remaking ""All Cried Out"" is a washout! And using 112 did not help matters anymore than the rappers used on the album. A good album, but not one of their best. An extremelackluster affair. The songs I like are Head over Heels, No Question and One More Chance. The rest of the album needs to recycled for the protection of the earth. These girls have gorgeous voices and voices like angels should not be given Gorgon songs. A total washout! My grade is:F!"
1,Don't judge an album by it's cover,"They may look all beautiful and angelic on the cover, but when you listen to the album you'll hear ugly, demonic voices. In other words, don't buy this album."
1,This album is pure trash! Worst CD of 20th Century!,"This album is so bad! Please don't waste your money on this album! The person who gave this album 5 stars must be deaf or have bad taste. This album is wack! horrible! Please buy better albums like Janet Jackson's ""The Velvet Rope""."
4,all cried out,i bought this cd mainly for 1 song and all i like is one song but the cd is good if you like this type of music of check out one of the best cd's ever billy crawford it has great reviews
1,Extremely Disappointing,My son purchased this game with a gift card that he received for his birthday. He was extremely excited to buy the game and could not wait to play on family game night. The game itself is a complete nightmare!! It is horribly designed and impossible to put together. It is the cheapest quality that I have ever encountered in a board game! After spending an hour trying to assemble it my son was in tears. I will be returning this game to Toys R Us for another game that can actually be assembled and played!!
1,Very poor quality - badly designed,"My son got this for his birthday and was very excited to play with it. Setting it up became a nightmare because the ""3-D Buildings"" touted by the game were nearly impossible to put together. Attempting to put them together involves trying to insert many small, flimsy card board tabs into small, badly cut slots. My son was in tears, and frankly, I almost was, too. Frustrating! I finally managed to cobble them together enough to start the game, but since they kept falling apart during game play we finally had had enough and quit. Frustrating!"
1,Mitchner's Hawaii Is Not Hawaii,"James Mitchner is an apologist for the missionary and American take over of the independent Kingdom of Hawai'i. If you have read this book and think that you know anything about the history of Hawai'i, you don't. If you think that by reading this book you will learn anything about the history of Hawai'i, you won't. If really do want to learn something of the history of Hawai'i, read Gavan Daws' A Shoal of Time instead. That book will at least give you an honest account that neither glorifies the Americans who stole Hawai'i nor the Hawaiian rulers who, in too many ways, let them get away with it.Don't buy this book!"
2,reads like a soap opera,Overall disappointed - most of the chararcters are 1 dimensional and the plot lines fairly predictable. The geological development of Hawaii was enjoyable.
2,Not a great novel,"This book started off slow with the formation of the Hawaiian islands and just continued from there. The second chapter was more insightful and interesting but it seemed to drag. Several pages could have been cut or edited out. It would have been better if this book moved through the years a little more swiftly, than dragging to each persons life. It was very difficult to finish and this is one book I will not re-read again. It was about as interesting as a school text book, without a teacher to bring out the lesson."
2,At times enjoyable and a great read but overall a long bore that drags on,I really liked the book from the begging I got hooked and could not stop reading. I loved the part with the missinaries and there triels and tribulations. We see how the missionaries tried tyo change Hawaii's customs on the people and we sew the down fall of the missionaries. But after that the book draged on and lost it's touch. It went on and on and on and only a few other things I enjoyed. i laos enjoyed the leaper partsd and the trials and tribulations of the chinese and Japense people. the problem here is that the auther gose on and on about pointless stuff we will soon forget. This novle could easly of been 500 pages but it's over 1000. I was dissapointed but it wasent entirley a bad book it was enjoyanle at times.
4,"A brick of a book, and worth every page.","Hawaii is 900 pages of fantastic story-telling. From the islands' violent beginnings to the relatively peaceful recent past, the full history of Hawaii develops page by page into a beautiful struggle of life in the tropics"
4,HOW THE HAOLES RUINED HAWAII,"Terrific book about the populating of Hawaii. From the Bora-Borans, to the stuffy missionaries, to the exploited Chinese, to the equally exploited Japanese, to something of equilibrium, the message is clear; JM was into haole guilt 40 years before it became politically correct to lay all blame on the white race. Apparently, the Hawaiians have a word for Caucasians, ""Haole."" In spite of JM's insistence that the haoles are the root of all evil, this was a great book about the struggles of the various ethnic backgrounds to make it in a new land. I read it on my way to Hawaii and while I was there. My one mistakes was not reading more of it before my trip. Very rich in detail and extremely informative. I found the view of the Hawaiian Japanese during the bombing of Pearl Harbor to be of particular interest. New perspectives on historical events are always welcome."
3,Cardboard cutouts,"Like all of Michener's books, which are considerable in number, Hawaii was educational more than completely enthralling. Michener does not create true literature, instead he generates literally thousands of cardboard cutout characters that move around and sometimes even bump into each other in exact replication of actual historical events! Think of a very colorful and detailed diorama with factually accurate period pieces and almost lifelike wax figures representing important events in history. It is sometimes pleasing to the eye, and it is always informative, but storyline and characters rarely rise above the level of a daytime soap opera. This same criticism could apply to virtually all of Michener's historical works."
5,Excellent Book and Captivating Read,Michener has written an incredible and exhaustive history of Hawaii - literally from the genesis of the land mass that comprises the islands of the 50th state. The first third of the book is about as close to perfect as possible. The remainder falls off just a hair - but is still more than worth the time spent reading it. It seems as the more populated the islands become - you find yourself rooting somehow for the pristine nature of the island to remain and for the non-native settlers to just go home. But I digress - if you have any interest at all in historical fiction or are planning a trip to Hawaii - or just like reading good books - pick up a copy of Michener's Hawaii - you won't be disappointed.
5,One of the greatest books of this century.,"This epic story by Michener is undoubtedly one of the best works of our century. It is filled with over 1000 pages of great writing, you wont be able to put it down!"
2,A long philosophical and boring book!,"Everyone told me that the book would be exciting, tremendous, thrilling and vivid, yet when I started reading I felt that Michener was dragging the story, not giving any progress, not letting the reader hold on to something, it was very frustrating to read the first 10-15 pages. After that chapter I was waiting for some improvement. The improvement came yet the second I felt I was connecting to the characters the book jumped forwards some 200 years. The book isn't written in an organized way and I am sorry I hadn't enjoyed it as much as some of the people who wrote other reviews."
3,Hawaii,"Hawaii is an epic novel about the history of the Hawaiian islands beginning with their formation from underwater volcanoes and the brave Bora Borans who came to settle the islands in their canoes to the U.S. missionaries and Asian peoples journeying for new lives in the exotic islands.This is the first Michener novel that I have read and I enjoyed some parts immensely while others fell flat for me and took awhile to plough through. The Bora Bora section was fascinating, showing their culture, customs, and bravery at setting off on an incredibly long journey without exact navigational directions or knowledge of what may lie ahead. I also enjoyed the tale of the early missionaries to the islands. Where I started to lose interest was with the very long section on the Chinese immigrants to the islands and the Japanese section as well, which I expected to be more exciting with the war and Hawaii's role in it.I'll try some more Michener novels, but for me this one was just ok."
5,Excellent,"Michener at his best. Great history, believable and engaging characters. A recommended read."
2,Misleading description,Book was advertised as being slightly soiled -- it's DIRTY!! I don't even want to handle it. I have submitted this review previously; I guess it was not made public.
5,Granddaddy of Hawaii Novels,"As a Hawaii resident, <www.waikikinews.com> columnist, and author of a Hawaii novel, I want to Give Michener his ""props."" This is the granddaddy of all Hawaii novels that introduced our island culture to the vast ""mainland"" and the world! If you loved this book and want more, or want to read something (shorter and more contemporary) set in more recent times, please check out our current literature by authors such as Lois Ann Yamanaka, Glen Grant, or. . . um . ME! Mahalo! And ""Stay Come!"" We'll hold a place at the luau for you! Cloudia W. ChartersALOHA Where You Like Go?: From Survival to Satisfaction by Honolulu Taxi"
5,Tingly skin!,Don't let the dark green soap color fool you--this product makes your skin feel tingly and wonderfully clean without any drying effect!
4,Kikkerland CD502 Multi Function Hammer Tool with Pouch,"I got it as a ""gag gift"" for my husband, but he thinks it is great to have in the glove box of a car, wants me to order more for our other vehicles.I just ordered 3 more, at Jimmy's request."
1,Piece of junk,"I wasted $20 on this thing. Once you fold out the knife, you cant fold it bsck in. I threw it in the garbage after wasting an hour on this peice if crap tool!!!!!!"
5,Let Us Worship Him,"I had never bought any of his music until I heard Keith Staten sing at a church in Columbia, South Carolina and he was awesome. This CD takes you into worship from the beginning to the end. I highly recommend this CD!!!"
2,Excellent book for Beginners,"This book is excellent for someone who knows nothing about Oracle and nothing about Java. The first four chapters are basically introductions to these tehnologies. If you're a beginner and you'd like an overview this text is for you. If however you want a book that shows you how to develop a professional e-commerce site, look elsewhere."
1,Too Many Errors,"There is a general sloppiness in the text that is totally inappropriate for a book aimed at developers who are starting ""from scratch."" For example, the SQL DELETE command shown on p. 98 will not run because the FROM keyword is omitted. The correct syntax is shown on the previous page. Another example is the incomplete syntax for the INSERT command on p. 85 --- the VALUES keyword is omitted. The INSERT examples on the following pages do have the VALUES keyword. Finally I must object to the claim ""... the standard SQL language is quite limited in what it can really do..."" p.78 I'm constantly amazed at the bloated and grossly inefficient code written by procedural programmers who believe that standard SQL is quite limited."
2,Code is not available!,The name looks promising and a quick review of the 1st charter and in fact it did a great job in teaching how to create db etc.The frustracted come from the not availabilty of the project code. Though the instruction clearly said it can be download via the web but he instruction is mis-leading and there is no follow up email from the publisher after a complaint.The simple fact is that they can't set up a proper web with well check link and yet try to teach up how to do so!
1,Not recommended,Setup and Code simply do not work the way the book says. I'm fairly computer literate but I couldn't get past the installation in the first chapter.
2,"Almost, but not quite!","This book lacks the detail required to get someone new up and running. The first 2 chapters are the best, but still need a little polishing. The rest of the book is lacking quite a bit of neccessary information so a user can read it and use the concepts."
1,Don't waste your money,"You can not find any difference between this book and a piece of junk. Also, the title of the book is misleading."
4,A mellowing of the Damned,"The Damned have been on the punk scene since 1977. Their albums are always creative and different. This compilation was released in 1986 on MCA records. It has been said that they were encouraged by MCA to try to move their sound into the ""mainstream."" The songs are definitely more mellow and ""mainstream"" than anything the Damned have done before, however, while David Vanian's voice is great for hardcore punk, it also has excellent deep tones for slower music. If you are a fan of David Vanian, you will like this album."
3,A step below Phantasmagoria.,"Anything was the Damned's second studio album fort MCA.Instead of branching out from their last studio album, they try to record a Goth-Pop album. The results are an over produced album with several weak songs left their fans and buyers scratching their heads. No one bought the album like the last one despite their top ten hit Eloise. David and Rat would part company. A few years later they would reunite with Captain and Brian James and do a series of farewell shows. Ten years later, the Damned would be back down to Rat and David touring clubs and releasing a demo album as a finished studio release. What a strange road the Damned has travelled.Recommended for die-hard Damned fans (like me)."
2,i don't know how people can listen to this,"man, i can't stand the sound of this album. the lyrics are alright, but the music is cheesy as hell. it has that horrible 80's recording on it.. the bon jovi hair-snare reverb and that slick vocal sound. i bought this album for 50 cents on vinyl... it's in great shape, if anyone wants it, just e-mail me and i'll be glad to send it to them. unless you're a big david vanian fan, don't spend too much more on this."
2,Questions about this title,"I wish somebody would find out why it is that this particular title has not been released on DVD where it is not only easier to find, but also a good deal less expensive! I have been trying to find this on DVD for as long as I can remember, why is this only available in other countries on DVD and not in the US?! When are they going to finally get this out to boot?!"
2,Where's the DVD??,Gotta agree with the previous two posters. Where's the DVD for this movie?? All of Chuck's movies are out on DVD except this one. What are you waiting for? The movie gets 5 stars from me but the waiting gets .000000000001. Ridiculous. And then you get greedy people on here who charge $123 for a DVD.
5,Tune Up Your PC,"The book is easy to understand and has excellent step-by-step procedures to follow so that you feel confident in what Faithe Wempen is instructing you to do.She also gives you a variety of other possibilities when the step-by-step procedures may not work in your particular case. It's as if she has 'every base covered'.I think a person, especially a beginner like myself, will definitely understand how to work on a PC after studying this book. It's also a very good reference book for beginners as well as those who are very knowledgeable about computers. This is a ""MUST HAVE"" book for any computer user."
3,A little more complex than a magazine,"This book is good. The thing is that if you have bought two or three computer magazines in the last months, you'll find that this guide maybe is not worth your money. I think that it should be a lot more detailed and easy to read."
4,"""Like all the music I've heard in my life"" (H Marks 1996).","No time for gushing or fawning. SFA are simply the most energetic, off-kilter and tuneful band operating in modern British music. Elements of bands and artists you've loved and hated down the years are fused into something eminently original and fresh - glam, pop, rock, funk and lysergic, unhinged sounds from deep space. Think of a supergroup consisting of Bowie, The Undertones, Marc Bolan, Cheap Trick and the Monty Python Horns. Then apply Fuzzy Logic and forget what you've heard before. And buy the more recent ""RADIATOR"" CD. It continues the theme in grandiose fashion."
4,excellent,"Can anyone, except the biggest fan of supermarket can American Idol music, NOT like an album that features the bursting line ""first time, I did it for the hell of it. Stuck it on the back of my tounge and then swollowed it.""If you are in that NOT, you're on the wrong page. Go in peace and enjoy some Susan Boyle.The nasil singer is not talking about gum. He does not have the strongest voice--but he sings with such swagger, such matter-of-fact attitude about his recklessness, we completely beleive him. His unrepentant frankness draws us inThis is the kind of confidence this whole band displays on Fuzzy Logic. This is not the most carefully written music--although it is a damm good glam-punk-colored copy of 1960s British harder-edge psych.But the way this music rocks is so convincing, so impossible to fake, you have to love this band for being unrepentant psych punks.These guys rock. With tye dye, and attitude, and with these Animals, that is more than you ever need."
5,Show me magic? they sure do,"This album makes me proud to be Welsh! its an unbeatable combination of quirky inventiveness, lyrical flights of fancy and some downright swoonworthy melodies. This album can go from brash to hauntingly beautiful in a moment... standout tracks include the delicate ""Gathering Moss"" and the anthemic ""Hometown Unicorn"". All up, poptastic! buybuybuy."
4,Numan's earlier days,"This album has a really ""weird"" sound to me, mostly because I bought it after hearing ""Down in the Park"" and ""Are Friends Electric?"", both of which are masterpieces. The rest of the songs are a mixed bag. I felt that some were pretty good, like ""The Machman"", and ""Me I Disconnect From You"", while the others were just average. This style was pretty innovative 30 years ago, and as a concept album the songs share a dark sci-fi theme. It isn't a similar style to his solo work in the 80's and beyond, but does mark a strong beginning to Numan's stardom."
3,Mixed feelings,"I bought this CD primarily for ""Are Friends Electric"". This of course was Numan's most successful vinyl single release - 4 weeks at number 1 in the UK in 1979. I remember loving it at the time, and it still stands up brilliantly. It really is his magnum opus. Worthy of mention also is ""Me, I Disconnect from You"". Both songs are wonderfully melodic, and seem personal and sincere, speaking as they do of loneliness/distrust etc.I have to say though that these are the standout tracks on this CD. What detracts is Numan's forsaking the personal and instead straying into cod sci-fi - his lyrics become rather embarassing and detract from the music. It's hard to take seriously ""Down in the Park"" for example, whatever its other virtues. The gibberish about such things as ""Rape Machines"" and ""Zom Zoms"" does remind you of just how young Numan was when he wrote this.If only Numan could have kept on writing songs like the two mentioned above, or ""Complex"" and ""Cars""..."
2,RICHARD ROUNDTREE IS SHAFT...,"BUT SAMUEL L JACKSON DOES A PASSABLE JOB IN THE TITLE ROLE. THIS IS JUST A VERY POOR ATTEMPT AT CAPITALIZING ON A GREAT BUNCH OF 70'S FILMS. I'D DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS TO DIE-HARD SHAFT FANS, BUT TO THE UNINITIATED I WOULD RECOMMEND THE ORIGINALS."
3,This Shaft deserves the shaft...,"Samuel L. Jackson. Vanessa L. Williams. John Singelton. Shaft. Had to be amazing right? Wrong. Samuel L. Jackson does his usual super job and is still the coolest man in movies. Singleton is still reaching to find that potential we all saw with ""Boyz in the Hood."" Williams, not a bad actress, is wasted here and basically ignored. The plot (with a Christian Bale doing a lousy impression of his American Pyscho character) is fairly weak. Several other excellent reviewers have talked about it, but I never really bought it. It is over the top, but is pretty dumb. The action is not bad. The music remains a highlight. I hope, if there is a sequel to made here, that Richard Roundtree gets more screen time. Dan Heyada is really funny. Before you buy this, go see the original, now on DVD. The original Shaft is amazing. Funny, cool, and the real deal."
5,WOW!,"This Movie is Great,I just conqured Shaft from the 70's.It si action packed and Gory.So, if you saw Shaft from the 70's.I also suggest you watch this one.The Story is a Black Man in the Begging gets Killed,then Shaft goes into jail for 2 years.After getting out of jail,the world went all upside down then our Legend begins."
1,It's worth watching once to satisfy your curiosity. That's it.,"It's worth watching once to satisfy your curiosity. That's it.There's no suspense, nothing new, nothing interesting in this movie. Samuel Jackson could not save it."
2,Shaft delivers 10 times out of 10? Not this time.,"Who's the man that delivers 10 times out of 10? According to the Shaft theme song, the answer is obviously Shaft. But after watching this pointless movie, it makes me wonder. There were a couple of interesting action scenes in the movie, and Jackson is always fun to watch as he struts his stuff. But this film was so formulaic, there was absolutely no question where it was headed and therefore no suspense involved at all. Christian Bale makes a convincing bigot & murderer, and Jeffrey Wright is great as Peoples, an endearingly slimy drug lord. But I would definitely consider this a movie to rent, not to buy."
1,"damn sam,what went wrong?","i didnt think it would be possible for me to give a film starring mr jackson such a horrible rating.but he left me no choice.i wont get on a technical rant but a more simplistic bashing of this mess.it was just corny.the cops are helpless goofs,the women are non existant(talent wise),theres a rapper in it(that killed it automatically!),the director was asleep at the wheel on this,and was there even a plot worth mentioning(i hope it wasnt the'find the eyewitness who saw it all'plot!).the only good thing about this was the lead bad guy.im sure this movie will get great reviews but trust me,RENT THIS 1ST(IF YOU MUST SEE IT AT ALL)THEN WASTE YOUR MONEY ANYWAY YOU SEE FIT."
3,Forget plot and just enjoy the ride!,"I have to say this movie isn't that big on plot. Its ok but thats not the high point of the film. Its pretty fun to watch Samuel L. Jackson go around in his suave stylish ways and fight crime in New York City. Jackson plays John Shaft, the nephew of the original John Shaft played but the man himself Richard Roundtree. Shaft is trying to get a man who two years ago killed another man over a racial issue into jail for good. All in all the plot is average but its just fun to sit and watch the fun. You don't have to see or even like the original Shaft movies which I haven't seen to see this. Jackson is great as Shaft. Isaac Hayes' theme is great, this time its redone. The dvd is half decent, it has the Shaft theme music video, a half decent featurette and some other features like cast interviews, a trailer, and other music videos. Rated R for violence, profanity, some nudity, and sexual innuendo."
2,"Unoriginal, uninspired","Boring movie. The term generic action flick comes to mind.The ending was really stupid. I like Sam Jack, but this movie was awful. John Singelton has fallen alot since Boyz in the Hood."
2,not shaft at all,"i thought this movie was the biggest pile of poo i had seen in a long time. it really is bad. nothing remotely exciting about it at all, and shaft acts so cool without ever proving he's cool in the first place. so what if this is an update of a classic, u still have to estabish the lead character, and not assume everyone knows where he's coming from. this film was also violent but pathetically violent. a bad film through and through."
2,"This film should have gotten the ""shaft""","""Shaft"" (2000)Shaft's (Richard Roundtree) nephew, also last-named Shaft (Samuel L. Jackson), is the star in this movie. But it is nothing like the original starring Roundtree and directed by Gordon Parks (although both of them make cameos in this film). The first ""Shaft"" was a blaxploitation flick and is a classic. This movie, directed by John Singleton, seems less black, more made-for-Hollywood. The plot is thin and unlike the original, the only love scene to be found is in pieces during the opening credits. And what was Busta Rhymes' purpose? It added nothing to the movie. Sorry, Sam Jackson is a hell of an actor but his Shaft doesn't make me forget about Roundtree's. -EJR"
3,SHAFT AIN'T SO BAD,"I SAW THE ORIGONAL SHAFT IN BOSTON YEARS AGO, WHEN MY HAIR WAS THICKER AND MY WAIST WAS THINNER. I GOT THE SAME IMPRESSION THEN AS NOW...DIRTY HARRY COULD EAT SHAFT FOR BREAKFAST! MR JACKSON IS A VERY TALENTED ACTOR, AND THIS BLACK CINEMA NOSTALGIA IS BENEATH HIM. WHAT'S NEXT, A REMAKE OF BLACKULA?"
1,This movie is horrible,"Not even the acting of Christian Bale and Sam Jackson could save this horrible, poorly written, bad directed movie. The original is far superior in the fact that it was campy 70's at its best. This movie tries to be campy and serious drama at the same time. Mr. Jackson bashed this movie upon release, and should tell you something. Training day, which explorers similar racial tones is a far superior movie."
1,anti !!!.,this shaft remake/sequel is nothing but an antiwhite racist movie. a white man(christian bale) kills an african american who happens to be in a interacial relationship. racial undertones are plentyful and are incorperated in most one liners.racist cop shaft goes on a rampage after throwing a white judge with his badge in court and disrospecting all his superiors without consequence. if you are a great fan of shaft i recomend the originals.
2,it was ok,"The film was good and I liked the fact that it had cast interviews. Still, the DVD could have had the making of shaft, deleted scenes and any other extras that come with the making of a movie. The fact that it didn't was disappointing. Hopefully one day, there will be a collectors edition of Shaft that will show all that went into concept & making of the movie."
3,I liked everything except the story.,"If you're going into Shaft looking for action, humor, and entertaining performances, you'll get your money's worth. If you want a complex or semi-intriguing story, forget it. Shaft's script is predictable and convoluted, with a few implausibilities along the way. Of course, Samuel L. Jackson steals the show and makes the film completely watchable. Director John Singleton proves himself able to direct action scenes as he crafts two exciting shoots and a decent car chase. The one-liners are fast and hilarious, coming in at a rapid pace. This is an enjoyable enough film, but not as good as it should have been."
5,Still a bnad mofo,"I wasn't alive for the original but it remaianed a classic to me. Lerarning Sam Jackso would be in the remake I was overjoyed. This DVD is My pick as Movie of 2000. Hard hitting action and a take no $h@t attitude Shaft represents what we all wish we could do and take on the problem head on instead of getting lost in the shuffle by the police. With a hillarious side kick in bustarymes and None stop actin, Peoples Hernandez was great. Highest possible recommendations, it's the feel good movie of the year!"
4,It's all about Peoples!!,"Shaft initially struck me as anticlimatic. Until I took a closer look at the stellar performance of Jeffrey Wright as Peoples. Wright captured the heart and soul of the designer-clad,thick-accented Dominican Republican and made him come alive in a way that brought a sharp pang of homesickness to this Bronx-bred sister. As I listened to Wright speak and witnessed his swaggering machismo I could hardly believe he was American born. This film was decent and sometimes even surprising but Peoples definitely proved himself the 'star'. Busta Rhymes injected a strong note of hilarity and Vanessa Williams was very believable in her role as a street cop (no sign of glamour). Samuel L. Jackson was a good-looking Shaft but came across as a little too volatile."
5,Still the man,"What can I say, Shaft is still a bad *******! John Singleton brings us Shaft, in an updated action movie with political overtones. What can I say, not only does Singleton show us what a brother can do in the new century, but he also kicks some serious tail! Yes, Shaft doesn't ""score"" to much with the ladies, but he doesn't need to. He's to busy kicking but."
2,A nice shoot out and er........,"Samuel L Jackson's range consists of a mannered drawl which rises to an intimidating yell and basically stays there (i.e.'The Negotiator'). He's been getting away with it for years.Love the bit where he is told about a white man's brutal assault on an innocent black man and a look of self righteous disgust crosses his face and clearly Singleton expects us to feel the same. Black on black violence is condoned however, and is executed with glee. Preposterously, Shaft shoots no end of people dead in broad daylight without any sanction whatsover.How about a more radical approach, like a white Shaft? Christian Bale looks sharp. A white Shaft who shoots other white people and looks digusted as a black man shoots an innocent white. Do you think the execs would have gone for it? Christain Bale looks so uncannily like James Brolin they could call it 'Crapandcorn One'."
2,Shafted.,"2000 remake of the original 1971 blaxploitation film that disappoints on nearly every level despite the talent involved. Samuel L. Jackson is nearly on autopilot as the NYC cop who nails a snooty racist (Christian Bale, back in ""American Psycho"" mode) for murdering a young Black man (Mekhi Phifer). The film is really a generic vigilante crime drama, with little surprises and countless stereotypes; the most obvious of which is Jeffrey Wright's performance as a Dominican drug dealer. Director John Singleton, who, quite frankly, hasn't done a good movie since 1991's ""Boyz N the Hood,"" has cheated the audience by releasing this shoddily-made film. The only good thing about this film is that the Isaac Hayes theme song has been re-recorded almost exactly as is, without any modern touches. Otherwise, you owe it to yourself to buy the 1971 original instead."
3,Too much white vs. black,"Although the movie doesn't hurl its slickness at the viewer and we're graced with a wonderful Samuel Jackson and a cast that is amazing, I was disappointed to see the old worn out cliché of the evil spoiled rich kid. It's clear that Singleton tried to balance the fine line between the good guys and the bad guys but it seems he didn't quite pull it off.Another thing that bugs me; Jackson as Shaft should have played up much more his sexiness and strut the way Richard Roundtree did so flawlessly before him, watching this we had the impression that Samuel thinks he's out of his league so he didn't want to embarass himself, but he certainly should have because he's got the goods.Plus I want a cool leather jacket just like the one he wore, anyone know where I can get one???"
2,Out of date,This book was great when it first came out and gave a marvellous overview of the Internet and the available resources. Unfortunately the Internet moves quickly and this book is virtually useless for current genealogy on the Internet. Look to more recent publications.
3,Too mature,"I bought this book so that my 10 year old could read it to me at night. Unfortunately the book is too difficult for her to read since it uses some pretty large words frequently. However, I can't wait for my children to get older so that they can read the book as I think it will help them so much. If you have a smart teenager then this book is for you, if they are not good readers or under 13 then I would not recommend this book."
2,Ok wow...,"How come none of the reviewers noted that most of the advice in this book is completely obvious and basic? Most people should already know this stuff: be a good listener, don't complain, don't act fake, etc. This guide is only for the teen that is clueless on how to act. I'm a fifteen year old, and this guide has not helped me any. Save your money."
5,How to win friends and influence people for teen age girls,"When I was growing up, I had a friend that was told by his dad that he could not leave the house until he read "" How to win friends and Influence people "" Well, he read the book and during the next year I seen many changes in him and he became the most popular kid in school. I have five sons and I made sure they read it and they are all doing great today!I purchased this book for my teenage grandaughter.."
2,Not the original theatrical aspect ratio,"The japan Region 2 DVD comes from a much cleaner and higher resolution master, has real dolby digital stereo audio mix. Also is the widescreen version of the film as originally shown.This release is 4:3.Also like the other voyager dvd's is hard subtitled.If you can afford it and understand Japanese i suggest get the original japan versions."
2,Final Yamato,Never saw it before and was a little disappointed by the animation. A newer revised version would be nice (updated with the present special effects technologies).
1,Get it translated,How do they expect people to buy these new shows if they are not dubbed in english. the box sets were english now they need to do these in english.
3,Best Book of Lists Ever!,"Having read the original Book of Lists years ago I had been looking for a book of equal value and interest. But this 'Best Lists' fails to produce the same quality of information. Other than being limited in its interests, the book is biased to information and lists stemming from England. There is too much other interesting information in the world....the sun set on the Empire long ago, and this book realizes the reasons for that. Putting all of that aside, there is still a vast amount of other fun lists here for any reader. So read on..."
2,Best Book its not,"I have read many books of lists and this one is not at all the best. It has too much to do with English facts. Much of the book is about London, Cricket and other British subjects. Not much interest to those of us in the USA. Too many British references with which I am not familiar."
4,Elegant,"I boughtthis sandal when the price came down. It is beautiful, I see people look at my feet first and then say good morning or good day. He works with so many things. I cannot say enough it just says class. It fits true to size. The one challenge I have with this and other Pelle Moda sandals is that the inside is that 'slippery' finish and so sometimes your foot moves around so you have to deliberately walk and hold onto the sandal with the ball of your feet. This the reason why it is not a 5. I have to say that at its origianl price it was a bit too high for me."
2,Inexpensive but unoriginal: for the undemanding only!,"This book attempts to cover what is a very wide-ranging and complex subject in a format suitable to the lay reader or electronics/space enthusiast. It's doubtful whether professional engineers working in the field of satellite communications would get much out of this publication.Although there is something to be said for the layout and the easy-to-find reference material, it is disappointing to see that much of the book is composed of cuttings from various ""fact sheets"" and brochures produced by space organisations. This results in numerous minor inaccuracies and use of data which is now rapidly being overtaken by events.That said, it's an inexpensive and readable little book which, despite its shortcomings, might appeal to the non-specialist."
3,A disappointment,"Not up to her usual standard. I just kept reading it to see what would happen, but it was not gripping and TOO GORY!! If you like this author, read Gate to Womens Country, Beauty and some of the others; this wasn't what I was expecting."
1,Major Disappointment,"The first two-thirds of this book was intriguing and imaginative, but it ended up as a mishmash of monsters and overdone good versus evil struggles. The protagonist is difficult to sympathize with and a lot of the characters are two-dimensional. The worst kind of novel is one that fails to deliver on the promises it makes, and The Visitor falls into this category."
3,"Not her best work, but still enjoyable","I have been a fan of Ms. Tepper for the last few years, so I have enjoyed many of her books. However, this one was harder to enjoy due to the deus ex machina brought into here (and the magic) I understood the story - and there were some GREAT lines in here as well as some awesome scenes - but like in a few of her other books, there's a deus ex machina that explains everything. I actually had more fun with the beginning and middle - and Chairs and Bottles are a unique idea. Overall a enjoyable book even if it's not Ms. Tepper's finest work. A solid 3.5 out of 5 stars for a entertaining read."
2,Mostly Good,"Throughout most of the novel, The Visitor is great. Its well-written, filled with interesting ideas, and quite suspenseful. But about 25 pages before the end it just tanks. This book has, and no hyperbole can exagerate, the worst ending ever. Truly, truly stunningly bad."
5,We like,"Very cute, smaller than I was expecting. That was only my visual perception. The description was excellent."
5,This Is a Job For Superman!!,"I am so happy that Amazon made this available online. I remember when this was at Best Buy, but my interesting in Superman didn't occur until it was too late to buy these at the store. I love this Clark Kent Bust. It is very detailed and proudly displayed on the desk in my rook. I love the way it looks as Clark is doing one of the most recognized and copied poses in history. It's a nice little touch that Clark is holding his glasses. Overall, a really cool thing for every Superman fan to have"
4,preliminary review,"It is a bit early to give a comprehensive review of Nail Tek II, but I really believe it is working to make my nails healthier. It will take a while longer to know the final results"
1,disappointed,"I have weak nails due to the use of artificial nails. I got this product during my transition from artificial to my natural nails. it does not work, because it peels very very fast. if it peels that means my nails does not have any protection and therefore it does not work. I have to constantly reapply and that's not practical."
4,Good product,Only really used this once so I am not sure how well it works. Had acrylic nails and my own were very soft. Need something to make them hard again. Will use again.
2,OOPS! Just another clear nail polish.,"I was told this product would do wonders for my nails, but have been sorely disappointed. Not only did it not improve the condition of my nails, it peeled off just like the bargain brand nail polish."
5,Product to Purchase,"Great product! It makes a huge difference in the strength of one's nails. With continued use of this product, one can have nails one could only have dreamed of otherwise."
5,It works,Well worth the money. it works. All you have to do is paint your nails with it every other day. my nails have instantly improved 100%. My nails grow nice and strong now.
5,Finally!!,"I've spent my entire life with brittle, cracking, breaking, splitting nails. I've tried more strengthening nail polishes than I can even name. On a whim, I searched Amazon reviews and found Nail Tek... one of the best purchases I've made. For some reason I was expecting it to be kind of gel-like, but it is actually very thin and watery. Just a small amount will coat your entire nail. I've been using it for a couple of weeks, and my nails are the longest they've ever been. Sold!"
1,Disappointed after first try,"This morning, following the instructions on the box, I applied Nail Tek Intensive Therapy II, followed by nail polish. 12 hours later, 4 nails have completely peeled off.It claims to last a week.Giving this to a coworker who said she would try.Going back to Sally Hensen."
2,Nail Tek not as good as Nailtiques,"In my opinion Nail Tek doesn't come any close to Nailtiques in its performance..Nail Tek feels simply like a strong adhesive that sticks on the nail, with nailtiques nail protein I could actually feel my nails harden in a very short period on time ..A clear nail polish would perform just as well as Nail Tek in my view, while saving you some cash.."
3,No improvements so far...,So far I haven't noticed any changes in the condition of my nails as a result of using this product. Not that it's a bad product but just seems to be another clear polish. Nails aren't chipping as frequently but they still chip even with this stuff on them.
4,Ozium - Vanilla,"When you want to remove the smell of something in your home or car, I can highly recommend this product. It does the job."
1,Mis-representation of this item by Amazon.com,I just received the Tutto Carra ITALIAN Version of Rafaella Carra and what a surprise! Although all the track tittles mencioned in the prodcut description at amazon are in Italian and the name Tutto Carra is Italian I ended up with the Spanish versions of her songs. Unacceptable. I am giving this one star because of the mis-represetnation and I did my homework trying to make sure that the item is the one I wished for. I love Rafaella and her songs do bring back memopries but I wanted the original italian version of her songs not the Spanish one. I will try to send this back and let amazon sort things out!Buyer beware!!!
2,Mine warped!,"I am a big fan of calphalon, but I bought this pan and it warped. It is no longer useable on my stove. This is the only Calphalon pan I own that I have ever had problems with. Sometimes my kids cook and tend to use alot of heat, so perhaps this is why it warped. It is also not as heavy as most of my other pans. two stars is all I can give this pan."
5,Grilled cheese extraordinaire!,This griddle is wonderful. Everything comes out browned just right and doesn't have that 'stiff' texture you get sometimes with non-stick. I love it!
2,Missing pin?,"Maybe I'm just stupid and should have realized this from the acronyms in the product description, but there is a pin that is not wired in this cable. This pin happens to be the signal that tells my laptop hardware info on the monitor I attach to... so when I hook this cable to my Samsung DLP HDTV that has a VGA port, my laptop can only assume its a generic VGA monitor and displays in resolutions that don't fit on my HDTV (like 1024x768.) I tried another VGA cable I had that has all the pins wired, and my laptop immediately recognizes the display as a Samsung HDTV and defaults to a 720p resolution. Since the purpose of purchasing this cable was to hook up to my HDTV, this cable is useless to me."
3,If practicing verbs is all what you want...,"...then this may be the book for you. Practice Makes Perfect has a super Spanish book, but I didn't find it so easy to use for Latin. Unlike the Spanish version, Latin Verb Tenses does not provide a lot of background information or equivalents that would allow a new student to work independently. Don't get me wrong-- it's not a terrible book. I was just expecting it to be as great."
4,Cute,"This cute little album is a collection of sixteen parodies of famous Christmas songs. Obviously sung for young listeners (age 4-6, I would say), these songs range from cute to quite goofy. So, if you have a youngster that likes funny music, then you would do well to buy this album!"
5,Myth-er Man does it again!,"This book is fantastic! I absolutely adore Robert Asprin's work. I wish he were writing more and faster. I would love to see another one of these, or another MYTH book (either Myth or MYTH-Inc.). The more twisted your sense of humor (though not scarily so), the more you'll like it. Enjoy!"
1,Makes the A-Team look like Shakespeare,"Imagine you are watching the A-Team on a small-screen TV. Now imagine that your are also watching a second TV (both small-screen and black and white), tuned to Battlestar Galactica. Imagine further that you are repeatedly striking your forehead with a brick, causing both pain and a substantial reduction of your IQ. You now have roughly reproduced the experience of reading this book."
5,Very Good Band Even Better CD,I am and have been an avid mineral (rip) :( but this album is soooo well put together and is complex yet simple. These guys know how to put together heart wrenching songs with the utmost emotion. If you are a fan of emotional music buy this recording it captures it well
5,They broke up?,"Have you ever heard, ""Something this good will never last?"" Its true. Or, at least for mineral. This cd contains nothing but good songs. Although at most times this is a little more mellow than 'The Power of Failing,' its beautiful and it still rocks."
5,the only word is rejoice,"This was mineral's sophmore effort on Crank! records. allthough losing some of the heavy guitars featured in their first release ""the power of failing"" they haven't lost any of the passion or emotion they have come to be known for. Lyrically, frontman Chris Simpson is amazing. Not often does one come across a songwriter who can put words together passionately enough to make me cry. Mineral did so on they're first album with the 2nd track ""gloria"" and did so again on a number of tracks with ""end serenaded."" To say the least, this band was amazing."
1,miserable mimimalism,"I got this album because there was so much enthusiasm about it. I actually couldn't stand listening to it, after song 5 I just unable to continue listening. The guitars were not exceptional, not bad, just nothing that isn't widely available out there already. The lead singers voice is depressing, off-key and uninspiring. Try explosions in the sky if you like their acoustics and atmospherics but find your struggling with the vocals you might like them"
5,if only we could see them play it live,"Bittersweet. Excuse the laconic review, but this is how it is: Mineral is the most powerful band ever. Chris Simpson is a musical and lyrical master. EndSerenading is beautiful. But they're gone now. It's over and we'll never hear his pleading voice sing ""I wish you could hold your ear up to my heart and hear how much I love you."" I guess we're all just lucky to have a chance to listen. Hold your ear to ours."
4,You'll need to be a blowhard but it works,"This little gizmo really does work. It seems to be pretty accurate, too, although it's tough to tell.You need to give it a good strong blow to get enough air through the little opening to get a good reading. I've tried using a straw to direct the air better and that seems to work. Unfortunately, there's no sensor that lets you know when it has enough air to take a reading. If there's not enough it just stays green even if there is alcohol present in your breath. Still, for the price it's pretty darned impressive.You'll need to experiment a bit because the instructions aren't very accurate."
3,sensitivity seems high,When testing myself the indication seems to be higher than normal i.e. after drinking half a can of Amstel light it indicates above 0.8
1,Does not work,"within a week or so it completely stopped working. I hold down the button and it shows a solid red, meaning high alcohol concentration, even though no one is blowing into it."
2,Good for only a few tries,"I got this device to test myself before I drove after drinking, like every other paranoid driver. It worked like a charm for about a month of two, then it ceased to calibrate when turned on, and stayed on the red <.08bac forever. So basically it became worthkess after a short while. But for fifteen bucks, what do you expect?"
1,"Inexpensive, but didn't last very long.","This tester seemed to work OK at first, but only lasted for about a week. Now it seems to have lost calibration and is basically useless. Save your money and buy a better unit!"
4,I liked this movie!,"Every single review here says the same thing. We all pretty much agree that Russell Crowe's performance was outstanding. His character was outrageous and down right villianous.What more can I say? This isn't an award winning film, but it was entertaining. And Crowe made it all the more so.It's an action/adventure film with some comedic moments(although I don't think they mean to be funny) with Crowe's character, Sid 6.7 -- a virtual character who finds his way to the outside world to terrorize Denzel's character. I didn't think Denzels' acting as that good in this. It didn't impress me as much as some of his later movies.All in all, it was a fast paced action thriller that is mindless yet Crowe's colorful character keeps you interested.I recommend this movie despite some of the bad reviews here...Try not to take it too seriously.Gotta love him in the purple suit scene."
3,Virtually Forgetable,Russell Crowe's gleefully demonic Sid 6.7 is the only thing about this film that makes it worth seeing. Everything else about it is a disappointment. Denzel Washington's long suffering cop performance gets tedious after about a half hour. I found myself wishing Sid would put him out of his misery.
1,Simply Awful,"Lord, please find a way to give me back the 2 hours I wasted watching this awful mess. Terrible in every respect. Worst acting by Crowe and Denzel in their whole lives."
4,Why I bought this movie,"I bought this movie for 1 reason: Russell Crowe. Not only can he act, he's my age & he's gorgeous. This movie did need alot of work, the co-stars in it didn't even try."
2,virtuosity-a good idea gone bad,"I thought the premise of this movie was amazing, however, with the one noteable exception of Russell Crowe, the acting was extremely overdone, and in some scenes, plain bad. The plot started out well, but deteriorated into a sappy psuedo-romance with no point. Denzel Washington, normally an enormously talented actor, struck me as bored throughout most of the film. I would highly recommend this movie to any Russell Crowe fans, but I suggest avoiding it otherwise."
2,"Confusing story to follow,but at least Russell Crowe shines!","This movie is a very confusing story to follow as the viewer does not where reality and virtual reality begins or ends! Virtuosity has hints of the Lawmower Man and the Marix. The cast does the best with the material they have !At least in this movie Russell Crowe(The Insider,Mystery,Alaska,L.A Confidential) shines a the killer Sid 6.7 ! Even though this movie is confusing you can watch this movie and see just how far Russell Crowe has come to finally get his Oscar Nomination(too bad he did not win! ) in his acting range! This movie should be fans of Russell Crowe and Denzel Washington only! Also co-starring in this mess of are the following stars: Kelly Lynch(Heaven's Prisoners), Stephen Spinella(The Jackal),William Forsythe(The Rock,Fire Storm) and Louise Fletcher(Invaders from Mars,High School High)!"
2,for laughs,"i watched this movie when it first came out but didn't remember until halfway through the film. my brain must have blocked it out for the purpose of self-preservation. the movie made me laugh out loud, and I was watching by myself. The plot has an interesting foundation but lost some of it when it was translated to the screen. For a movie released only 5 or so years ago, their vision of 1999 is far-out (a metal arm? hello! ) and loses some effect since 1999 has come and gone. Although Denzel Washington does a good job with what he has, I think Russell Crowe had a lot of fun with his role, but it somehow didn't fit into the movie. Save your money. Go see Gladiator. (no blue goop in that one.)"
1,VIRTU-SNORRRRRRE-ITY,"Pretty boy Denzel Washington in another bland, boring, icy attempt at an action flick where the villain's more charismatic than he is (remember Ricochet?)"
2,2 stars just for the two oscar winning actors,"This has got to be the biggest stinker in Denzel's long movie career, just after the oscar winning Philadelphia, he went on to star in this cult Sci Fi movie based on machines outsmarting mankind in a virtual reality game, Russel Crowe also stars in this very, and i mean very bad movie. But hey, if you're a Sci Fi fan, watch this, but don't expect high rated acting from any of the two big stars. On account, this movie didn't make any sufficent funds at the box office and was later labeled by the Hollywood critic, The Only Movie with Two Lead Star To Not Hit The Box Office. This low budget sleepy movie isn't worth watching, if you love Sci Fi, that outakes the life of machines aginst the human race, pick up a true 5 star Hollywood material like, 'A.I', 'Terminator' 'I', 'II', 'III' or Will Smith's new movie, 'I, Robot'."
4,Well Made and Fun,"While the film was panned by critics, it turned out to be one of the bettera action films of the year. Yes it's a tad campy but Virtuosity is filled with some excellent action sequences. The film has a visual style that is both modern and futuristic and this works well. It feel real enough but still manges to be imaginative. Denzel Washington does a fine job as he does in nearly every film but the real star is Russel Crow. I remember how wowed I was by his performance back in 1995 and think that he would one day be a huge star. I was right. Virtuosity is worth checking out if you wanna see a well done Sci Fi/Action film."
4,Crowe steals the show,Russell Crowe is fantastic and steals the spotlight away from Denzel Washington who also does a fine job in this futuristic movie.I will be the first to admit that the storyline is not the greatest but the entertainment value is excellent. Russell Crowe (Sid 6.7) is a computer generated bad guy who needs all the attention that he can find. The only man for the job is Denzel Washington who is sent on a mission to find and destroy Sid 6.7. That is a tough problem because Sid can rebuild himself similiar to the Terminator.The more attention that Sid receives the more outrageous he becomes. Kelly Lynch also stars as Denzels partner.DVD sound and picture is very good.
4,"Average story, great acting.","Virtuosity is an average movie, with excellent actors. Denzel and Russel shine, while the story just lies stagnant. In the future, cops are trained by virtual reality criminals. The most dangerous programed villain, Sid 6.7, has been incubated in an android body. Now he is loose in the real world and is after his favorite cop. He will do anything to satisfy his insatiable hunger for carnage.This movie is pretty darn entertaining. The story itself is kind of lame and convoluted. Russel Crowe and Denzel Washington are their usual awesome selves. They make a great duo and far surpass the low potential this movie inherently has. If you want to see what a couple of superstar actors can do with a crappy plot, then watch this movie."
3,Russell made the picture,This is certainly not a best picture contender. I was glad to have it letterboxed on the disc. Wish the material could have been better for both the leads. The other minor characters did nothing to help the film.
1,It's something-somthing,"To put it kindly, this movie needed a lot of work. Plot was iffy, dialogue was just pure drivel, characters were sooooo not believeable (Kelly Lynch was annoying, irritating, and just about everything that would deserve a Razzie). Truly, the only thing good about this movie was Russell Crowe. But if you like him, see him in another movie that actually makes sense (i.e. The Insider, Gladiator, L.A. Confidential, Romper Stomper etc...) and save your money."
5,Dub o' Funkness,"As an avid listener to Tosca after being introduced to Suzuki, the preceeding album, this newer album brings more amazing beats and melodies to an already kicking electronic base. The first song brings you into the power and feeling of Tosca's unique style and wicked rhythms. Check it out; you won't be sorry!"
1,Garbage,Didn't know this was a single. Just remixes of the original and not the genuine deal itself. Do not buy this.
1,A disappointed long time customer of Amazon.com,"I was very disappointed upon receiving the last order of books about Anansi the Spider Man. I realize they were used books but they were rated the highest rating by Amazon, and I have not been disappointed before. The books were in terrible condition and what made it worse was the writing in them. My students were surprised I presented them books with writing in them."
5,Sold my VHS copy; Dumb decision...,"Like most people, when I got my first DVD player, I sold most of my VHS tapes. This film has often remained in my memory and I'm sorry I don't have it; even sorrier it's not on DVD. It's been a few years, but I recall spooky stuff, mixed with light-hearted humor and teen rebellion. Also, a profound reference to the decay of the Hollywood glory of yesteryear. Certainly, this is not a classic, but I was entertained a whole lot, and that's what makes movies enjoyable to me. Loads of fun!"
3,Charlie Spradling.....,"The only reason why I would say I like this movie is because of the short scene with Charlie Spradling.Horror B movie fans know her as the busty brunette from such movies as puppet master 2.In this movie she has a funny,but very nice sex scene.Hence the 3 stars..."
5,Soul Talk is for Everyone,"My wife of twenty years and I are happy to have found Soul Talk. It provides us with insights about our relationship that we had not considered. For example, I had not considered how the words I use might not be processed by my wife in the way I meant them. Our brains are wired differently and the book gives us exercises to practice communication that works. We would recommend each person read the book separately, compare notes by chapter, and then use the information to learn how to talk more effectively to each other. Any relationship will grow through Soul Talk."
2,"some useful insights, but a bit overblown","I bought this book with a lot of optimism, and found the first few chapters fairly insightful and helpful. However, the more I read, the more redundant, unrealistic, and impractical I found Atwood's advice. Perhaps I just don't want a ""soul partner"" as defined by Atwood."
1,not bruce lee,in this version 90% of this discrace was use with a stand in. horrible acting and story.. the fight scene with the real bruce lee was cut in half. this move is horrible......dont buy it....ive seen the full fight scene on tv when he went through the levels with 2 friends but not sure of what it is really called.....
2,"Yep, It's Pretty Bad","""Game of Death,"" as you may already know, was finished six years after Bruce Lee's death with 30 minutes of Bruce Lee footage (cut down to only 11 in the final version). In the rest of the movie, the inconveniantly dead Lee is doubled by some other guys. I bet the writers wrote this movie based on how they could disguise the doubles. Doubles are seen wearing sunglasses, bandages, and even fake beards. In one classic instance, Bruce Lee's face is superimposed over one of the doubles. The plot itself is really awful and enough to make one sort of queasy, but the movie, while not for the purist, is a certifiable curio.The DVD is in its original aspect ratio of 2.35:1. The picture looks bright, but a few scenes are scratchy, and the colour often bleeds. The box advertises a theatrical trailer, even showing a picture of the main menu with ""theatrical trailer"" as one of the options. Frustratingly, it is nowhere to be found."
3,Other Lee Movies Are Better,"I cannot say anything BAD about Bruce Lee's movies. I am biased becaused I am a BIG FAN. But with all his movies this one has to come last. Just because most of it isn't the DRAGON himself. They put in a double who did a pretty good job imitating the ""moves"". Props to him, definitely. But there is only ONE BRUCE LEE. It's still worth owning (I know I do), because of the legendary fight scenes that are in it. The pure-ness of his ""no-style"" style. If you decide to buy this...then you HAVE TO buy Return of the Dragon and Enter The Dragon to say the least. Chinese Connection and Fists of Fury also go on the list. Respect the Legend. Respect the Dragon. Peace to you and Good Health.One Love."
2,It's not the Master!,"Bruce Lee unfortunately faced his death tragic having only completed a few scenes in the Movie. The producers did not seem to make much of an effort in hiding the fact that this was not Lee, as we can plainly see it is not him. The few fight scenes Lee did perform are fantastic (as you would expect) but all in all I was quite dissapointed at this poorly made movie."
2,A disrepectful movie to Bruce Lee and his fans.,"I was very dissapointed when I bought this movie. After watching about fifteen minutes of it I discovered that it wasn't really Bruce Lee. The fights are very crappy (except for the one with Kareem-Abdul-Jabbar)and badly choreographed. The actor who filled in for Bruce did not resemble him at all especially in the fighting and muscular sense. The ""Fake"" Bruce is always covering his face and when it shows Bruce's face it is a clip from his other movies. I think it really ruins Bruce's reputation."
1,Dumb.,"This is definitely Lee's worst movie. Even Fists of Fury (which is his second-worst) seems a lot more exciting and dramatic than this joke of a flic. The Bruce Lee imitator in this film was actually, okay, but the film should never have been released. The plot was cheesy, the acting, mediocre, and even the fights at the end in which Lee, himself, finally appeared were some of his worst and least memorable fighting scenes ever recorded; they just stank. A Lee documentary is much more worth time and money than this heap of mahoganey."
1,"0 STARS FOR THE MOVIE, AND 5 FOR LEE",THERE IS MUCH BLATANT GREED APPARENT HERE CONCERNING THE LACK OF CREATIVITY AND THE OBVIOUS EXPLOITATION OF LEE.THE FOOTAGE OF LEE SHOULD HAVE BEEN USED IN A DOCUMENTARY OR THE LIKE. K.A.
2,"Should only be considered a ""Bruce Lee"" movie","Bruce Lee in quotes, because he isnt in most of the movie. Since he died during the making of the film, a very unconvincing double plays his part through most of it. There is a fight scene right in the begining with Chuck Norris, as a teaser, but from there, you'd have to fast forward to see the real Bruce in action again.(almost to the end!) Finally, you will see a fight scene for each star I gave the movie, 2! Although it is interesting to see him fight Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, there is alot of bad movie to go through for just a little of true Bruce Lee. I would think the footage would be best in a documentary type film on Bruce Lee's work, and certainly more respectful than attempts to cash in on a legend!*rs* END"
2,totally disgraceful,"I totally agree with the people who honestly know about the movie and it's disgraceful dubbing, The great Sigung(""master"")Bruce lee would be turning in his grave for cutting those brilliant fight sequences that he perfected in the movie, so, in addition, I personally think that those producer's should pull there finger's out, throw the old game of death movie's away, and redo the movie so that every Bruce Lee fan can truely see the master at his best, so if you do own the video, you should know that fast forwarding to end is a very good move. Thank you."
3,HUG,THIS MOVIE NEEDS A HUG.I WATCH THE MOVIE JUST FOR THE PART THAT BRUCE LEE IS REALLY IN IT.THE STORY IS NOT THE WAY.I GIVE THE MOVIE 3 STARS FOR THE PART THAT BRUCE LEE IS REALLY IN IT.
3,Real Bruce Lee Scences Make this Movie A Must Have,"Bruce Lee died not having finished this picture (he put it on hol dto make and promote Enter the Dragon). Robert Clouse directs in 1977 to complete the film, but the plot is completely changed. Silly camera tricks, Lee footage cut out and doubles used take a different approach than Lee in fight scenes.The movie excells when Bruce is on screen. The fight between Lee and his personal friend Danny Inosanto is brillant. Of course it is cut by Close, but no matter, the presence of these two greats is outstanding. The fight with Kareem is fun and Lee's humor shines. The acting by Dean Jagger as the head villain is also a good performance.While the camera tricks to show Bruce Lee's face on the doubles body is laughable, the film and concept are not that bad - it is the ""rudeness"" of changing the concept and ""tricks"" that are so offensive.One last note,the musical score is surprisingly good."
2,Pathetic,"For those who don't know, Game of Death was intended to be a Kung Fu film in which Bruce Lee climbs up a temple and fights different challengers on each floor. Unfortunatly he died while making it and rather than giving up on the film, the producers decided to use a double for most of the movie and splice in shots from Lee's other films and the 15 minutes he shot for the movie. I wanna start by saying whoever did the editing for this movie should be shot. It's terrible. It's very easy to tell when shots were mixed in. In fact, it's so bad it's funny. The only reason I don't give this film one star is because the 15 minutes that were actually shot by Lee are remarkable. They are some of the best fight scenes I have ever seen. My advice is to fast forward to the end and watch the real Bruce Lee."
2,let down,"I wasn't expecting this movie to be like this, the version I watched when I was younger.. this one had some dude wearing shades and a really bad stand in for Bruce Lee I waited a long time to be let down"
3,Not the Real Game of Death,"I did not read the title properly, this is Game of Death 2, and I wanted the original, it's a OK movie but not what i really wanted, but like I said it's OK to have in my collection."
2,If it weren't for the goofy noises..,"I can tolerate the corny juxtaposing of Bruce Lee's head and the borrowing of older Lee clips in several scenes in this movie. I can get over the dumb dialog from various actors, especially Bob Wall; who comes off as a nerd and sounds nothing like his brutish voice-over from Way of the Dragon. I canoverlook the cheesy plot that they reworked from Lee's original idea for the movie. However, I can't, with all my might, stand the ridiculous whiny cat noises Billy Lo makes when he fights; which is a shame, because the fight choreography is excellent - from both the original Lee and his doubles.Sample fight scene noise - ""ADAH ADAH ADAH WOOO ADAH ADAH ADAH WOOO ADAH ADAH ADAH WOO ADAH ADAH ADAH WOOOOOOOOOO"" ugh..."
3,A mob boss tries to muscle in,"The first scene is a rare fight between Chuck Norris and Bruce Lee.Late in a reenactment of the last scene of ""Fist of Fury""that actor Bruce Lee is playing is shot in the face.He stages his death and sets out to exact his revenge.His girl friend is kidnapped sparking the final showdown.This movie has many later martial arts stars in it and is the last Bruce Leemovie as he died under mysterious circumstances during the filming."
1,One big joke,This movie is just pathetic. The movie says that Bruce Lee is the star but instead its some other guy pretending to be Bruce Lee (due to Lee's death during the making of this film). They take scenes from other Lee movies and stick them in this movie. There is even one scene where there is a cardboard cut-out of Bruce Lee's face on the double. This movie is only good if your looking for a movie that is just one huge joke or if your dead drunk.
1,It seems even a Master gets no respect after they are gone.,"This pathetic attempt at filmaking only goes to show you how far Hollywood will go to make the all mighty dollar. Bruce Lee was a true master of his art and deserves the respect of one. This was supposed to be Master Lee's masterpiece. Instead, the producers were too worried about making a quick buck off of a star's death than keeping Mr. Lee's vision intact. The use of his funeral in the film is the most blatant example of disrespect I have ever seen on film. On behalf of the idiot's who supposedly finished this disaster, Mr. Lee, we your true fans appologize. Obviously your life and work weren't as important to them as it is to many of us. Dont buy this video out of sheer respect for Bruce Lee; or at least out of taste."
1,shameful exploitation,This video is a disgusting show of disrespect to Bruce Lee and his whole family. They should've donated the footage they had to the Lee estate after his unfortunate death. These filmakers should live the rest of their lives in a cold dark cave. Don't buy it. You will only feed the greed. It is pathetic and insulting. No stars.
1,BUYER BEWARE!!!,"This is not the item described in Amazon's product description! The docudrama followed with re-edited footage of ""The Game of Death"" is called ""Bruce Lee: A Warrior's Journey"". I had seen this great film on TV and made the mistake of believing amazon when I read the description of this movie. What it actually is is the ORIGINAL version of ""The Game of Death"". That means half of the movie contains a Bruce Lee stand-in and even goes so far as to have a picture of Bruce Lee superimposed over his face. Unless you are buying this movie to see just how bad Hollywood can ruin a man's legacy (see Orson Welles), DON'T BUY THIS MOVIE!"
1,Now Rendered Pointless,"At one time I would have recommended getting this film solely to see the amazing fight sequence between Bruce Lee and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (the only part of the movie filmed before Lee's death). However, thanks to Bruce Lee - A Warrior's Journey (now widely available complete and uncut as an extra on the Enter the Dragon 2-disc special edition dvd!), it is now possible to see both this fight scene and the once lost fight scenes leading up to it cut and edited the way Bruce Lee originally intended. As a result, Game of Death has been rendered completely and utterly pointless and should forever be relegated to the trash can."
5,~I feel this is Bruce Lee at his best besides E.T.D.~,"Bruce Lee as we know is the master of Wing Chun Gung Fu, the creater of ""the way of the intercepting fist""(for those of you who do not know that is Jeet Kune Do), and the master of about any weapon in his hand, especially the deadly Nunchuck. I feel many people did not give Bruce Lee his credit for this movie. You have to be blind to not see the value of this movie. I must admit that Enter the Dragon has this movie beat just alittle but not by much it still gives it a good run. Bruce lee inspired me to become a martial artist. He is the ultimate martial arts experience. Enjoy....===~~=== Nunchucks"
1,Rip-off of Bruce Lee's unfinished work,"This is a hodgepodge of film being passed off as a Bruce Lee movie. Bruce Lee died before finishing this movie, and has less than 20 minutes of actual footage of him. The plot of the movie does not even correspond with Bruce Lee's original intentions. The parts that actually show Bruce Lee are heavily edited.If you want to see the intended parts of the movie that were filmed before Bruce Lee's death, rent ""Bruce Lee: A Warrior's Journey."" While that is still not a complete movie, it explains his philosophy, not just flashy fight scenes.This movie is a waste of money, time, and space."
2,Game of Deception,"Regardless of what the filmmakers want you to believe, Bruce Lee completed only 15 minutes of fight scenes for ""Game of Death"" before his untimely death in 1973. Those exciting 15 minutes can be found in the last half-hour of this ludicrous ripoff. When will producers learn that they cannot resurrect a corpse from the cutting-room floor. It didn't work with Bela Lugosi or Peter Sellers - and it fails miserably in ""Game of Death."" However, the actual Lee footage is worth seeing."
1,This DVD stinks,"This DVD ... majorly. May be it's my disc, but not all the features are on the disc. Where's the theatrical trailer. The package says it has a theatrical trailer, but the disc doesn't. ... I'm returning this ... DVD and will buy it when the features written on the case/package is on the disc.9/16 Replacemnt DVD had no theatrical trailer. So my recommendation still holds."
4,WHAT'S THE NAME OF THE GAME?,"GOOD AND INVENTIVE STORY LINE, {ALTOUGH VARIENT FROM LEE'S ORIGINAL SCRIPT}. TALENTED NAME ACTORS PLAY THE PRINCIPAL ROLES, EXCELLENT MARTIAL ARTISTS APPEAR THROUGHOUT FILM {BOB WALL, DAN INOSANTO ETC.}. COLLEEN CAMP AS FEMALE LEAD IS HOT. GOOFY CAMERA CLOSEUPS OF BRUCE LEE FACIAL CUTOUTS THE ONLY NEGATIVE. STORYLINE OF BRUCE FALSELY PRESUMED DEAD BATTLING FOES MAKES FOR SUSPENSEFUL STORYLINE. GREAT BRUCE LEE FIGHT SCENES AT END. ENTERTAINING AND INTENSE. A BRUCE LEE MUST SEE."
2,Classic Movie ....AWFUL DVD!!!!,"I will keep this review short!!This DVD isn't a digital transfer-the sound is MONO!!!! Yes, you can get the SAME sound & picture with a decent VHS version of the movie.Wait for a better release!! (THE ONLY Bruce Lee DVD that is completely digital w/5.1 Surround Sound is 'Enter The Dragon'!!!).Save your money!! SD"
2,"Sad, so sad","this is truly disgusting, taking a dead man's out takes, footake of his funeral, throwing in doubles that hide behind sunglasses and trying t pass it off as a Bruce Lee classic. its almost as bad as all those Bruce Li and Le rip offs. if Bruce was still with us he wouldn't be too happy, thats for sure. HOWEVER it does include a pretty good fight scene with the master himself. so for that reason alone i give i did no tgive it a 1."
2,Save Your Money To Cheesy,This movie would have been cool if Bruce Lee could have finished it in 1970. But the finishing by Raymond Chow is worthless. Don't buy it save your money our buy Fist of fury.Or if you like cheesy movie or the last fighting scene. Buy it
2,Game i death,I liked the movie until he had is horrible death the qualidy was not to good but the movie was ok
5,I have no Title.,"The spectacular fight scenes with the real Bruce Lee in Game of Death is the only thing worth mentioning about this movie and the only scenes worthy of 5 stars. As for the rest of the movie, Warner Bros did one hell of a job finding every exact duplicate from Bruce Lee to Dan inosanto. All in all, the movie stinks. I recommend anyone out there not to buy this film but i do recommend you look into ""Bruce Lee: In G.O.D."" which you can find on ebay. The DVD shows all of his last fight scenes from Game of Death - its worth it. Theres only one ""WAY"" and thats the Bruce Lee ""WAY"""
2,One of the worst Bruce Lee movies I have ever seen,"This movie was a really pathetic attempt to make another Bruce Lee movie after he died. In fact it was completed about 6 years after his death. Only 20 minutes at the end of the movie show Bruce himself, and those 20 minutes are the only reason I bother sitting through the rest of the movie 'cuz they got some good fight scenes, like when Bruce fought against Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Dan Inosanto (and I might add, those are two of his JKD students). If you bother to watch this at all, be prepared for a long and boring movie with Bruce look-alikes. I only suggest this movie to fans of Bruce Lee (and only fans that will not be offended at the funeral scene in the movie, which was bootleg footage from Bruce's funeral)."
2,"Meanwhile, back in the 60s.","This is just like an updated B movie from the sixties and I enjoyed it. It's real comic book stuff. The effects are not bad, the pace hardly flags and the cast seem to be enjoying themselves so it's easy viewing. I enjoyed this more than big budget films such as Evolution or Jurassic Park 3. But I think the absence of big names will put people off, not that it matters because the cast here do a fine job. And if big names don't matter to you then you could do a lot worse than watch this."
3,Awesome - if you're a B movie scifi or Terry Farrell fan,"Anything with Terry Farrell in it rates Five stars in my book, she is one of the,(if not thee), most beautifull and sexy women alive, not to mention a very intelligent, talented actress, I wish she had the confidence (she has the talent) to do more quality movies. (she'd be awesome in a romantic comedy) What can I say I'm a fan. But to be honest this is a Sci-fi B-movie action adventure, Probably low budget, but the special effect are good. I gave it 3 Stars for having Terry in it, her acting is very good (considering the script). If it had a bigger budget, a better plot and script it would earn the 3 stars or more. But still it is a fun movie to watch and I enjoyed it. But you have to be a B-movie, SCI-FI fan to really enjoy it. (or a Terry fan) I'm both. The cast is good and the acting, I think they had a lot of fun making it, and some of you will watching it."
1,Steer Clear,"Absolute junk, one of the worst films I have seen. You will be doing well just to stay awake for the duration."
5,Good quality and reasonably priced,"I love these forks. I previously bought the set of spoons as a supplement to my drawer of flatware (it seemed we were always running out of spoons!). I figured they were nice and plain with no design, so they wouldn't clash with my usual set of flatware, which is fairly plain itself just with a swirl at the ends.I was so pleasantly surprised with the high quality and comfort of these shiny new spoons, and they have quickly become my favorite to reach for in the drawer, so it became necessary to buy the matching forks!"
2,"Warning, Made in China","Disappointed were not the same quality as my Oneida Flight sliverware. There's a slight indentation below the base of each of the fork prongs, so they don't look as good as my original set, but they will do for everyday, just disappoionting and markings on back different, made in China."
5,Oneida Forks,I use them for everyday purposes. I find them to be sturdy and to me they look quite nice (not cheap). They are standard size dinner forks. I would buy again if I needed more.
5,Journey to a Special Place,"Meijer's piano compositions take you on a journey to another place, a refuge for listeners. Lay on your back and look at the clouds drift by, gaze at the snow on a star lit night or sit by the fire and watch the mello flames flicker across the wall; these are just some of the ideas Meijer's music evokes for me. Marty is authentic and original. He creates music that is uplifting, hopeful and meditative. What a great gift he shares with us all."

My problem is that it's missing alot of the songs they used in the film but what can you do.P.S. Attn A Music Fan,The song in at the end of the movie where Ryan kisses Tara is Smartbomb - Hello.Your welcome!"
3,Rating depended on personal preference,"Why only three stars? Well, it was just a matter of my own musical taste. I didn't like anything that wasn't punk-y or rock-y on this album. That said, it's super-easy just to skip over the songs you don't like, to get to the ones you enjoy."

5,excellent for young music students,"a good book for teaching elementary aged children music theory, it covers the basics and some more advanced stuff as well. lots of Black and white illustrations, comics strips and such. the book teaches the note names and spelling with pictures and stories."
4,It fits on my shelf and doesn't embarass me,"So, I have a lot of games. As these games age, and other games are placed on top of them they crush the boxes of the games below them. Corners crack, tape is added, tape dries out and the boxes become disgusting to look at and drag out.This series of attractive wooden boxes is different. Like a nice leather bound collector's edition it fits on the shelf, holds all of the pieces and goes back in place compact and safe. I have to think a carpenter was the first to come up with the idea for these relatively speaking classics.While the board's fold up is the biggest issue I have with it, this is Risk and no childhood should be without it."
5,Wow!! A great family night board game.,"Let me tell you one thing. This game beats going out to the movies,no doubt. Six of us, ranging from age 10 to 49 spent over 2 hours the other night playing this fun game. We didn't want to stop, except for the fact it was too late, and some family members must get up early to go to work, even in the summer. This traditional game is back in our family, and my husband and I have introduced the game to our three children and our daughter's boyfriend. We all had so much fun playing it, that we're going away on a family trip next weekend, and yes, we'll be packing this game. It's so important to keep families bound together these days, and what better way to accomplish but to have family game nights, especially in the summer time. When you have two teenagers and a twenty year old, playing with two adults and a 10 year, should speak all in itself. Not one person was bored at any given moment. Enough said except RISK is a great game!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Risk Wood Book Edition Used,Game is as described except for some writing on the cover. Without the writing it would be in great shape.
2,Huh Hah my big toe!,"First, be forwarned! These are NOT the original tracks. Close, but no cigar. In my opinion, the only three songs worth listening to are ""Die Verrater"" ""Dschinghis Khan"", and one of my all-time favorites, ""Moskau"". My German isn't what it use to be, but I do know at the last two are not the original cuts from the late 70's, and I'm not altogether sure if the artists are the same. Not a bad collection, but pretty pale stuff compared to the originals I drank so much beer to in what was then West Germany. Prosit!"
5,An excellent resource for those who are considering marriage,"Bill and Lynne Hybels have taken years of experience in premarital counselling and combined it with honest real-life situations from their own marriage to produce an excellent resource for persons considering marriage. They cover personality issues, potential flash points, common pitfalls and anectdotes from their lives to bring this book to life. A very good read."
3,So you found Ms. Right?,"This book evokes a stern sense of cataclysmic reality in dealing with two opposites attracting. Be careful, just because your attracted sexually doesn't mean it will last. Bill and his wife give a typical, but volatile picture of their own dating experiences. While dating, I read this book with my girl friend of over 2 years, I started to realize that problems might arise later in our relationship, and they did. This book will help you cut the perverbial attachments that could ruin your life forever. Read this book, keep it for a reference guide, give it to dating couples who are serious."
1,Disappointed,"I have a tremendous amount of respect for Bill Hybels, but this book was a disappointment. It is the chronicle of a bad marriage, of people who probably shouldn't have gotten married. The Hybels bad experience colors their advice, causing them to make blanket recommendations, such as everyone should date for at least a year before considering marriage. What people need prior to marriage is an understanding of what God intends marriage to be. This book doesn't provide that.I'm glad the Hybels marriage is good now; but if you're looking for a pre-marriage book, check out Neil Clark Warren's _Finding the Love of Your Life_."
3,Rehashed sayings,Nothing super personal in this and very religious. I don't think relationships and religion is synonymous and there I realized this book wouldn't provide me with any information I wished to follow.
4,Awesome read!,"This is a great read for singles, those in dating relationships and married couples alike. Bill and Lynne Hybels offer a personal look into the struggles and success of their marriage. They provide a transparent account of the lessons they learned from their own marriage and give valuable advice to the reader."
3,Disappointed Nadia fan,"I thought when AD Vision picked up Nadia it would be a good thing because I would finally get to see the entire series restored and remastered where Streamline Pictures left us hanging. The problem is, they REMOVED the original English dub to replace it with their own TERRIBLE voice acting script. It's totally unwatchable except in original Japanese language with English subtitles (how I watch my Anime anyway, but Streamline's voice actors actually fit the characters and did an excellent job!!). There are no extras added to the DVD either...C'mon ADV, do a good job!! It's a classic anime."
5,Make room for Nadia!,"I am a 13 year old girl and I love everything Japanese. This video is as good as other Japanese anime like Sailor Moon and Tenchi Muyo. I would really like to see more of this series. The two other Nadia videos Amazon sells are both on this video. There are a total of 4 stories on this video, so it is worth paying a few extra dollars for it. These stories are perfect for kids my age."
4,A missing piece of Monticello is back in place!,"I purchased this book because I enjoy reading everything I can get my hands regarding Monticello. This book brings Monticello's ""quiet"" years to the fore. Uriah and Jefferson Levy rescued Thomas Jefferson's home from certain destruction, despite adversity. From whom or what? Read the book! I gave the book a four instead of a five star rating because, Theodore Roosevelt could not have been a member of the Thomas Jefferson Memorial Foundation in 1923. He died in 1919. Perhaps I was reading this portion wrong. But the book was a delightful read nonetheless. Thanks!"
5,A Fine VCR,for 70 bucks this is a great value! i returned my ge 4 head vcr in exchange for this one and i'm keeping it.
2,Not Enough Sipowicz,"I was disappointed by this book. It was not what I thought it was going to be. I love NYPD Blue and I love Sipowicz. I think Sipowicz is the most interesting, complex, and real character on television. I found that many of the essays (the book is comprised of 16 essays on different themes in NYPD Blue) use Sipowicz and NYPD Blue merely as a launching pad to discuss more general topics. For example one chapter starts off discussing Sipowicz's interaction with AA, but then turns into an essay on AA, not on Sipowicz or NYPD Blue. There's not enough Sipowicz in this book for me."
4,Fun to read,If you are a fan of NYPD BLUE or a law enforcement junkie you will enjoy this read. I personally am retired NYPD Detective.
1,Do not waste your time or money on this book!,I should have read a closer analysis of this book. I thought it would be entertaining about past situations presented to a ficitonal character and how he responded. Instead it was a bunch of rhetoric from scholars disecting fictional situations. I would not recommend this book to any fan of NYPD Blue. BORING!
5,Exellent,"This is my absolute favorite game. I used to play a lot during childhood, and as I got older I started to miss the fear and the fun that the gatekeeper brought to my house!! So glad I re-bought this game. Its worth every penny."
5,Great game!!,"Wow this game is SO much fun!! I play it often with my 12 and 9 year old and it's so much fun, even if noone win's! My children have a blast, especially right at the end when game play seriously speeds up to see if someone can get to the end!! It is a little spooky, so it may not be for the younger children, but my 9 year old does fine with it, as long as I leave the lights on :). I recommend this for a quick family game session, that's just as much fun with other adult's as it is with children. BEWARE THE GATEKEEPER!!"
2,ATMOSFEAR ISNT NIGHTMARE,I have to say I loved the Nightmare games. I have all four. I was disappointed when they stopped making them. Atmosfear is not the same. The Gatekeeper in Nightmare was such an evil guy. He was always on you but Atmosfear was too tame. If you really want a fun game find the Nightmare games. They were originally only on VHS. The first is Nightmare with the Gatekeeper; Nightmare 2 with the Baron (Zombie); Nightmare 3 with Anne De Chantraine (witch); and Nightmare 4 with Elizabeth Bathory (vampire).
4,VHS version a little better...,"I played ""Atmosfear, The Harbingers"" on VHS in the mid-90s and several years later bought a copy of the game through ebay. Then, I saw this DVD update and gave in to temptation when the price was marked down. Here's my judgement: 1) The mechanics have been simplified. This has it's pros and cons. It could have been made easier to learn without removing as many components. 2) The gatekeeper has less of a nasty/funny balance in the DVD update. 3) It is a major upswing to have his dialogue randomly disbursed.One reviewer seemed to think the game was boring. I'll guess, instead, that the people he parties with don't have the attention span for board games. Too bad for them. Atmosfear - The DVD Board Game get's a B+ from me."
3,1st edition was better,"The 1st version of this game was a fun and exiting game for my family. but we soon got bored of the same video over and over. We could not believe it when we saw a new version of the game out, we rushed out to buy it and found this version not the same and not as complicated or as fun as the first they should have just released the first version of the game with new dvd setup it was a waste of money."
2,Bad follow-up...,"This album is a bad follow-up to ""Daydream,"" probably her best album to date. But the extra star is for the songs ""Honey,"" ""Butterfly,"" ""My All,"" and ""Close My Eyes."" They're pretty good songs."
5,Mariah scores another hit...,"Many critics have hailed Ms. Carey as pop's anonymous princess, lacking both soul and emotion and replacing them with mechanical vocal gyrations. On this album (and most other Carey albums), these so-called ""mechanical vocal gyrations"" convey emotion on their own. ""Butterfly"" and the Reprise are beautiful, with great lyrics, and a voice you can FEEL. Most of the songs on this album pack a powerful emotional punch, only ocassionly sounding contrived or ""mechanical"""
2,"Something old, something borrowed","There is nothing wrong with sticking with something that works! The only difficulty that I have is that no one seems to be able to hear the effects of all these vocal pyrotechnics on her voice. She has taken a gift and completely destroyed it. IF she ever had seven octaves (a piano covers 7 and a half), I would be surprised to learn that she is functioning with anything more than three right now. My advice is to get rid of some of the rollercoaster and opt instead for some smoother sailing."
4,i love mariah!,"i just love mariah! and her album too! my favorite songs are honey, fourth of july,butterflyand babydoll."
4,I think she is a very good singer.,"I think Mariah Carey is a very good singer. Some people say that her voice sounds the same as the piano. The album which I chose to review is called ""Butterfly"". My favourite song from this album is ""Honey"". This is a slow, dreamy R&B song. This whole album is excellent . Most of the songs in this album are R&B. All of her songs are good to listen to when you want to feel in a quiet mood. I would like to recommend this album to people who like good R&B and soft rock music."
4,really good but not the best...,"mariah was pretty good, but on ""honey"" she sounded a bit too loud. ""the roof"" and ""my all""are really good. so all in all she was pretty fantastic"
3,Fair,"I used to love Mariah Carey, I loved this album too. But, I wonder why she is singing frequently with an annoying voice, instead of her own original beautiful voice. I was a little disappointed, but in general it is still a good album, I recommend "" My All"" and "" butterfly""."
4,"not the best,but not the worst.",I think Mariah has done pretty good on her new c.d. It may not have her old swing in it but it has some pretty good songs. To the people who think it will be a dissipointment it won't.
4,Good effort Mariah!!,"Butterfly is a pretty good album but I think her fans will take a bit longer to get used to the NEW sound and fans of her old ballads will not be very happy. Highlights are ""Breakdown"", ""Outside"", ""Honey"", ""Butterfly"", ""The Roof"" and others. They are very different from her old work but its still good music. As long as Mariah's happy with her work, you go girl!!"
1,I WOULD GIVE IT 0 STARS IF I COULD. WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!,MARIAH CAREY's album sucks. She had such a good voice but now she sounds like she has a SORE THROAT (a very bad sore throat) and she screams so loud you don't understand what she is saying in her song.Take it from me this album is s**t. I have a few words of advice for Mariah:Stop the screaming and start the singing...
4,It's like butter.,"Even until today, alot of Mariahs albums are half good, half not. She always packs alot of decent songs among the few big hits from an album. Not so with ""Butterfly"". Not only do we get the new sexier Mariah here, but we get an album that's pretty much filler-free. ""Honey"" is as irresistable today as it was in 1997. ""Butterfly"" and ""My All"" are both wonderful and lyrically deep. I love ""Fourth Of July"", and I really love ""Breakdown"". Both are so good. Mariah also drops the expected cover, but this one is tops, and ""The Beautiful Ones"" truly is beautiful. The ""Rainbow"" album is similar to this, and I like it as well, but there's just no beating the music here, and of course Mariahs cover shot."
5,Soaring to new heights!,"The first time I allowed myself to listen to Mariah Carey, was when I got her Daydream cd for christmas. Until then I had no interest in Mariah Carey's music. When I received Daydream I became hooked. I listened to the cd for hours everyday. After that, I could hardly wait for her next cd release. I bought Butterfly the day of its release. I must tell you, as an owner of over 60 cds, next to Lauryn Hill this is the best cd I own. Lots of people comment on the rap and hip-hop sound that Mariah has adopted. I think it is a wonderful attribution to this cd. Butterfly is one of the few cds in which I can listen without skipping a track! I listen to it for hours on end. My favorite track is Fourth of July. This song deplicts a lot of the feelings you have on a first date, trembling, starry eyed. It's just an absolutely beautiful cd, and I definitely recommend it for all Mariah Carey fans, old and new!"
2,Nothing Great!,"I have been a fan of Mariah's since she first came out. I am still amazed with this woman's amazing knack for talent, but I think she went much too far with this cd. She portrays a trampy image of herself, and it isn't a good example for her younger fans."
4,"Good, but not necessarily the best from Mariah","I became a huge Mariah fan only months ago, and one of my goals for this year is to collect all her albums. Well, this is the 3rd album I've heard by her, following #1s & Rainbow, and I have to say, it's not one of the best. There are too many ballads, not enough up-beat songs. But it's still good- It's got the great ""Honey"" on it, which I think is Mariah's best song EVER, and there's the Butterfly interlude. This is a good album, but if I had to choose between this & Rainbow, Rainbow would definitely be it."
3,Try It At Least,"It depends on what mood your in. I really don't know what 2 say. This Isn't much more different than Daydream, or Rainbow. You can pick out songs that sound exactly the same. Like Petals(Rainbow), Close My Eyes(Butterfly) they sound the same and another example is Whenever You Call(Butterfly) and When I saw You(Daydream). It has some nice points in the album but can get borring because of all the ballads. Like I said before it depends on what mood your in because the slow songs can put you to sleep. I found the album pretty good after i gave it a try. Maybe you could do the same, at least give it a try."
5,Best Mariah album to date,"The lyrics are amazing, the music is awesome, her voice sounds great.. The songs are INCREDIBLE. Enough said really.....check the other reviews for more info ;-)"
1,Don't waste your money,"Here we go again, with sugar-coated love songs, but with an added twist: she now considers herself an ""R&B crossover artist"". It doesn't work. Mariah Carey, the singer that once told a reporter that she couldn't understand how Alanis Morissette won Grammy's for singing songs with ""sexual lyrics"", sings a few songs about sex herself (""Honey"", ""The Roof"", ""Breakdown"")."
1,Simply dreadful,Overproduced in spades by that overpaid Puffy guy. She's drowned out by the noisy backup singers most of the time. Offensive lyrics. Gets 1 star for the photography.
1,Oh Dear!!!,"After hearing the delightful ""Honey"" I figured Ms. Carey had finally decided to brave new frontier so I bought the cd. How wrong I was! Save your money and just buy the ""Honey"" single since it is obviously the only good song she will ever make. The rest of the cd is pure dribble in true Mariah Carey fashion..."
1,ugh!!!,"this album was a terrible dissapointment!!!!!!! i liked daydream, so i thought this might be good, but it was boring, and she had to many songs that she sang with rap singers, if i could i'd give this zero stars!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,The worst Cd ever!,"I think that ""Butterfly"" from Mariah Carey was the most boring, factory-made CD ever. There is nothing creative or new, same old, same old. This CD is a total waste of money. I would rather listen to Lauryn Hill or even Cher!"
1,zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,if mariah worked a little more in her head than on her head she'd probably gain some proper respect as a musician. her music is all about fake love and she never writes anything smart. i don't believe she's ever made a song that's worth listening to. what a bore.
2,yawn,"I love Mariah and most of her music, but I think that this cd is very poor. The only songs woth a listen are butterfly,my all,and the roof which is ok.Outside is the most beautiful ballad I've ever heard in my entire life.Everytime I hear that song I cry. But other than that all the songs are boring,repetitive,or just material that does not suit the amazing miss. carey."
4,Very Nice,"This album is a natural evolution of Daydream, as Mariah once said. I don't know if it;s becouse she finally got free of tommy that this album was so good. Lyrics, Music, production. 1. Honey - Nice Up tempo, great production. 2. Butterfly - I like this ballad, but her voice at the beggining is too dramatic. 3. My All -Great hit ballad, #1 song. 4. Roof, The - Her first ""real' HipHop tune. Great. 5. Fourth Of July -The poorest song on the cd, copy of Daydream's ""Underneath The Stars""6. Breakdown -Creative, great lyrics and melody. 7. Babydoll - Sensual, mellow song. 8. Close My Eyes - deep song 9. Whenever You Call - typical romantic ballad 10. Fly Away - (Butterfly Reprise) - dance mix of butterfly 11. Beautiful Ones, The - features sisqo, too long 12. Outside - outstanding ballad. great lyrics, melody, production, voice."
3,ok,"I think the upbeat tracks(honey,the roof,breakdown,babydoll, and butterfly reprise) are the only good ones. Her ballads are boring and monotonous, as she no longer has the voice to pull them off.I think her lyrics are pretty weak too, she used to write better lyrics on her previous works.But it's still alright, but definately not her best.If you want to get the best Mariah there is, get Musicbox, or Rainbow.Those releases are much better, and flaunt her vocals a lot better."
3,R&B? Not really...,"as popular as she is, Mariah is not R&B and never will be. her vocal range, though exquisite is best left to ballads and laid-back tunes. her forays into hip-hop are a mostly a joke, and i think she knew it, hence her 'sabbatical'...Mariah is an excellent vocalist, butif you are looking for R&B, look somewhere else."
5,A new direction for Mariah -- I like it!,Mariah has done it again. She proves that she can change her music with the times and still keep her soul in it. Mariah is and always will be my most favored artist. I keep at least one of her CD's in my car disc changer at all times. I can't go a day without hearing her sing. Mariah can be my Babydoll ANY DAY!!!
3,"...so,so, could be better!!!","I am a Mariah Fan since her Debut and when I bought this Record I was soooooooo dissapointed about this weak stuff! But the more often I heard it, the more began it to grow on me. Now, I must say it is not that bad, than I thought back in 1997, but it's really not the very Best of Mariah Carey. Then you should buy the Album - Musicbox- it is her greatest. On that Record she's got the best time! Butterfly has a few nice Songs, like - Whenever you call (my favorite), Honey ( it has to grow on me more than one year! Now I like the Song very much!), My All, Close my eyes and Outside. All the other Songs doesn't sound very good. I cannot understand how she must revival the beautiful Song of Prince - The Beautiful Ones???? Only Prince's Original is so great and absolutely attainable! She shouldn't do that! All in all, there is a new Style on this Album. You must see for yourself, if you like it or not. It is not a must have in your CD-Collection!"
3,other side of mariah carey.,"mariah's 97 album ""butterfly"" is mature mariah.with the 1st single off it ""honey"" and other songs on the album like ""my all"",""the roof"" and ""breakdown"" it's a diffent mariah no one has saw before."
3,A follow-up which is....,"relatively disappointing. In an attempt to cross over to R&B, Carey takes small but sure steps there. That isn't to say the album is such a success. It lacks the consistency of ""Daydream"" where every song stood out. The most obvious flaw are the ballads. Too often, they blend in the background and end up sounding too alike. Thankfully, the other songs almost make up for the disappointment. ""Breakdown"" is perhaps the best song in the album. She uses 'hush-hush voices' to great effect. ""Honey"", the only uptempo song in this release, is catchy in its own way. And ""The Roof"" is cool and sophisticated. In fact, the outstanding songs here are much better than the amazing songs in ""Daydream"". Perhaps after this album, Carey could make a more consistent and cohesive album?"
2,LETS BE REAL HERE,"I USED TO BE HER FAN ..BUT ONCE SHE GOT DIVORCED SHE WENT CRAZY. SHE NO LONGER GIVES US TRACKS LIKE HERO WHERE SHE USES HER RANGE NOW HER VOICE REALLY ANNOYS ME AND I WILL CHANGE THE STATION IF SHE COMES ON. WHAT A WASTE OF TALENT. SHE WAS UP THERE WITH WHITNEY BUT THEY BOTH FELL OFF SO LOOK WHAT WE HAVE NO..MARIAH SHOWIN ALL OF HER GOODS, NOT SINGIN WORTH A DAMN, AND WASTING FOLKS MONEY ON AN ALBUM TO HEAR HER SCREAM AND DO WHATEVER SHES DOING IT SURE ISNT SINGING.. DONT GET ANYTHNG BY HER UNTIL SHE GETS REAL!"
1,The worst piece of ... I've heard in a very long time.,"You've got to be kidding. Reading over the other reviews, I can't believe how many people enjoy whiny, girlie music. This woman has NO TALENT and is only where she is because of her ability to hook up with powerful MEN in high positions (Tommy Mottola, Puff Daddy, etc.) I don't really know where Derek Jeter fit in. Anyway, the music, if you can call it that, is like noise pollution. Absolutely wretched. I just heard her cover of Diana Ross's (a REAL talent) ""Do You Know"" and it made me nauseous."
1,The Votes are in...,"For the longest time I couldn't decide which ""artist"" I hated more...Mariah Carey or Whitney Houston, but after hearing this cd the choice was obvious..."
2,Career suicide,"Seems like Mariah committed carer suicide with Butterfly. Honey is simply a song that she used to show her flesh than artistry and honestly, only My All makes the cut. Without the explosive lung power, she delivers the song with the most emotions she ever did. And the song is beautiful! Other than that, Mariah, afetr the divorce, was Mariah trying to be hip, which simply didnt work!"
3,"A slight improvement, but still not much emotional honesty.","Small improvements in the songwriting department are weakened by Carey continually deteriorating arrangements, lack of artistic cohesiveness, and the central stylistic conflict that plagues her to this day -- that she's simply not suited to singing dance songs, and she has nary a funky bone in her.Certain tunes recovered a little melodic sense: The title track, ""Butterfly"", finds Carey rediscovering some of her balladeering skills; ""Babydoll"" and ""Breakdown"" sound pretty good, as does ""Outside"". But ""Honey"" continues to milk the zombie that was her ""Dreamlover"" formula, resulting in another limp-wristed dance tune, and ""My All"" matches sub-par lyrics with unmemorable melodies for yet another Carey ballad that missed the catchiness and melodic appeal of Carey's pre-1993 ballads while retaining the schmaltz.And on she marches, selling more records year after year, but her music no longer means anything to me."
1,BLAH!!!!!!!! YACK!!!!!!!!! EEK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Y'know, as much as it pains me to say it, but this album is horrible and is way below Mariah's standerds. Now c'mon, Mariah could've done a lot better of than this piece of garbage."
3,"OK, but not as good as her previous albums.","I used to be a big Mariah fan, and own all of her albums up to this one, but I won't be purchasing any more. Yes, there are a few good songs on here, such as ""Butterfly"" and ""My All"", but the album has too much of a hip-hop flavour for my tastes. But I do respect her for doing what she wants....all artists have a right to change and grow. And I know this album appeals to a lot of people, which is cool. But for me, I much prefer her older albums like Music Box and Daydream."
4,This is not Mariah's best,"I bought this CD for the song Butterfly but when i first heard it I was really dissapointed because it has so many R'n B/Hio Hop songs on it that are really boring. Now I have it for almost three years and I really like it. But it's as i said by far not her best work.Honey: I didn't like this at first. It introduces not only the album but also the ""new"" Mariah. Now i like it.Butterfly: This ballad is still my favourite song on the album.My all: This is Old school Mariah. If you liked the songs from ""Music box"" you'll probably like this one.The roof: This is just boring. Why did she release it as a single?Breakdown: The same goes with this one.(Wasn't right was it?)Babydoll: The lyrics are so sassy. Sweet like sugarClose my eyes: Very atmospheric ballad with wonderful lyrics.Whenever you call: Another Old school Mariah - ballad. This is the version without Bryan McKnight.The beautiful ones: Please, no Prince-song!Outside: Nice song."
3,Still formulaic like her the one that preceded it!,"Sorry, Mariah, but the ""same ole', same ole'"" was not working here. Yeah, there are a few good tracks (the title cut, ""Fourth of July"", ""Babydoll"") here, but the bulk of the album is so similar to ""Daydream"" that if you have one, you have the other.The standout is the Prince-penned ""The Beautiful Ones"". With Dru Hill's assistance, Mariah's whispery vocals add just the right touch to the music of ""the purple one.""It's too bad the rest of the album doesn't ""fly"" like this tune."
3,An Average Album,"Despite the fact this album was VERY different from Mariah's previous album as it marked her first real step towards the R&B music she would later immerse herself in, the album is pretty unremarkable. Apart from the upbeat ""Honey"", and the beautifully inspiring ballad which is the title track, the album does not have much to offer and all the other sings are deceptively similar. ""Fourth of July"" is a pretty song and has fun lyrics. But it has the same groove as ""Breakdown"", and ""Babydoll"". I can't COMPLETELY disagree with another reviewer who termed Mariah's singing here ""incoherent mumblings"". If you fell in love with her powerful vocals in sky-high ballads and her cute squeaks in her upbeat pop confections, this is not for you. Despite all the blabbering, the Bottom Line is: If you like Mariah-the-pop-artist, Stay away from Butterfly. If you like Mariah the artist you should definetely purchase this album. You'll love it."
1,Insanely Awful,"This ""Butterfly"" set is confusingly monotone, yet unfocused. Her crumbling musical prowess is thinly spread, with each dance number sounding like the one before. Carey's ""Fourth of July"" sounds like an elevator tune, while ""Honey"" is an embarassing hip-hop number that pales to the likes of Lauryn Hill."
1,Lacks Heart,"Mariah Carey's Butterfly may have a couple of catchy tunes such as ""My All,"" but overall, the album lacks heart and soul. Throughout this set, Carey sings without meaning. Sometimes her notes hit above the stratosphere without reason or feeling -- it often appears as if Carey does not know why she sings. Carey is disconnected, lacking artistic rapport. Also, Carey's lifted lyrics (we all know Carey is the cover queen) and vocals are less than stellar and often end up sounding weak. Her title track, ""Butterfly"" sounds unconvincing and thin. The rest of the album are fillers, mindless tracks that are neither infectious or cute. ""Honey"" is an out of shape dance track, while her rendition of ""Whenever You Call"" tries to recapture the magic of ""Music Box,"" but fails... miserably.Many credible music critics still have yet to accept Mariah Carey as a true artist; let's just say this album won't make them change their minds."
1,Butterfly should turn back into a catapiller,"If you think this is the best album, you must be nuts.We all know that Mariah has an excellent voice which is demonstrated in Emotions and DayDREAM, but lately, mariah has gone stupied in her voice and these days sounds crap. If you have seen recently in the MTV awards, tv shows, and divas live Video, you will realise that for the first time after her break up with Tommy, her voice is often out of tune and not sounding well. Why don't you take a listen to the new concerts and compare it to the eary videos she made from 1990-1995.You will see what i've been talking about.Carey used to be respectable and a real lady while all along she wanted to be Nasty Madonna. I have no respect for her any more and would not care if her next album flops. If you want real singing, collect her early albums and also Celine dion."
1,Enough Torture Already,"This album was not my favourite at all. I use to like Mariah Carey until she started getting all into rap.... It's a waist of time. She isn't what I would call a ""Diva."" Please, I don't want to put up with her annoying, squeaky, high pitched voice."
4,Not bad...but Janet is still better!,"Breakdown...Honey....My All...good songs, but Mariah get played out too fast! Yeah she can sing and sure she looks but she's turning into a lil' hoochie now! My girl Janet Jackson is still the Queen of Pop!"
5,SHE IS A GOOD SINGER,I THINK SHES A GREAT SINGER AND HAS A GOD VOICE ALSO I THINK HER AND PUFF DADDY SHOULD GO OUT!!!!!!!!!!!!! AND U SHOULD GETTHE CD!
4,Butterfly gives me butterflies,"It's a really great album from Mariah Carey. It's a perfect blend of soft rock, r&b, and hip hop elements without overdoing it with all those guest rappers we repeatedly hear today. The best songs are Honey, Butterfly(Mariah's BEST BALLAD), My All, The Roof, Fourth of July,Breakdown,Babydoll,The Beautiful Ones, and that interlude. The singles released from this album also have Mariah's best videos to date. I recommend this CD to everyone. If you have to buy a Mariah CD, make it this one or Daydream."
5,mariah's best recording ever,I can listen to this entire gem of an album all the way through and I love each and every song. My top 5 picks from Butterfly are:ButterflyMy AllWhenever You CallBreakdownHoney
4,good music,"I have always belive that this is the best from ms. Carey.I have the casset, and now the cd. best part is her voice, best song. I give my all."
2,Disappointing!,"While there are a couple of acceptable songs (including the title track) on this album, overall it remains a clear disappointment and cannot live up to Mariah's early works. It seems that the rising amount of flesh visible on the album cover is negatively correlated with the quality of the music (see also ""Rainbow""). Less ""screaming"" and rap and more quality ballads would suit a singer with her potential better."
1,What the hell is this?,If it were possible I would have given this no stars at all! Through this whole album mariah sounds like she just had her tonsils taken out. The I am the best in the world attidude has really got to go! To all who read this Stay FAR FAR FAR AWAY FROM THIS cd
1,One word: GARBAGE,"This is the worst cd i have ever heard!! it lacks any content, and i'm almsot ashamed of her sorry attempt at rap and hip-hop! not only do her songs get worse, but she has started wearing considerably less. I was surprised that this was even her cd,it was so bad. DONT BUY IT!!! Any cd on the shelf would surpass this one."
2,BORING....,"I had heard a lot of good things about Mariah Carey's music, so I bought this album. However, the only songs I liked were ""Honey"" and ""The Roof"". I also liked the remix version of ""Butterfly"", and almost liked ""Babydoll"", but every other song sucked. All Mariah does on this CD is moan and groan. Who can listen to a person who sounds like they're throwing up every few seconds?"
4,this is a great cd.,Mariah has always put out very amazing albums but this one is by far her best. She has the prettiest voice I have ever heard.
5,I loved it so much I went to buy 2,"I love Mariah she is so pretty just like me, All her C.D's are the best if you don't have one or all I strongly reccomend that you get them fast because she HOT she will and I mean WILL sell out very very VERY quickly so get them NOW! If I got a chance to see any singer star it would DEFINITLY be her no douts about it! For all her fans Thanks for supporting her just like me!"
5,HOT!,"Mariah Carey is a very beutyful and talented singer. I esspecialy love the way people make her look so hot in her videos. She is especially hot in ""My All""s video. She is wearing a nice bathingsuit. I love the way her voice sounds and the rythm of her music. That is why I gave this CD a ten, and why I think she is so HOT!!!!!!!!"
5,"Well, this is just perfect.","Mariah Carey is one of the most fascinating singer in the US as well as all over the world nowadays. Her single voice can melt a million hearts out there. To me, Mariah Carey is my number one favorite singer. I adore her voice. She sang many wonderful artists that provoked my emotion and my memory. Thus, I like a lot of song singing by Mariah Carey. One of them is ""MY ALL"" in Butterfly. ""My all"" seems to tell the girl's confidence. And I like it. Most of the men like it. They like it because they long to meet the one who is so adorable like that, like the one Mariah Carey. To describe entirely my reaction about Mariah Carey, words can not even be able to help me. That's all I can say about his talent singer."
5,My favorite album ever!,"This is the best album, in my opinion, that I've ever heard. Every song is just pieced together so well and Mariah has never been more candid. Every song is so personal that with this album you get to know Mariah more than you ever did. The ballads are strong, beautiful, and emotional. While the upbeat songs are fun, cute, with strong beats. I've never been more proud of an artist."
4,Can't she do anything wrong?,"Top selling artist Mariah Carey has done it again. But than again...can she fail? I strongly recomend the songs ""Butterfly"", ""My all"", ""Fourth of July"", ""Fly Away (Butterfly Reprise)"" and her Def Club Mix of ""Honey"". It isn't as good as her ""Music Box"" album, but if you already have that, buy the Butterfly album!"
3,"Not the ""real"" Mariah","This is a good album, but the ""new"" Mariah isn't! Her voice is too thin and so is her wardrobe. I like some of the hip-hop songs like ""Breakdown"" and "" The Beautiful Ones"", but on all the other ones it's like she tries to hard to be black. She puts on an act and tries to be cool for everyone like she's paranoid about what people think about her. The fans would think very highly of her if she acted like her normal self. Over all the album is worth buying just like evey other one of her albums."
2,A boring waste of time.,"This CD was the pits. Mariah Carey's voice is raspy and thin, and her songs aren't very influential. Some songs, for example, ""Honey"", have pathetic rapping in them saying stupid things like, ""Mariah on fire."" Her recent CDs were much better, because she had a stronger, more powerful voice instead of the sore throat one she has on this CD. I hated this CD, and I'm sorry I wasted my money buying it."
1,What happened to Mariah Carey?!?,"Oh, what a disappointment the ""new"" Mariah Carey has turned out to be. I used to enjoy her lovely voice and beautiful ballads, but now she had turned into somewhat of a skeezer. Does she think that this new type of so-called music gives her credibility? She already had that. Now she just makes the crap du jour, and looks like a tramp on top of it. It's a shame that someone who was such a role model with songs like ""Hero"" has turned so trashy."
4,Mariah at her best,"Butterfly, in my opinion, is Mariah Carey's best album. Mariah Carey herself even thinks that it is, calling it her magnum opus (which means ""great work"" in English). The best songs on the album are ""Honey"", ""Butterfly"", ""My All"", ""The Roof (Back in Time)"", ""Fourth of July"", ""Breakdown"" (featuring Bone Thugs-n-Harmony), ""Babydoll"", ""Close My Eyes"", ""Whenever You Call"" and ""Fly Away (Butterfly reprise)"". ""The Beautiful Ones"" (featuring Dru Hill) and ""Outside"" are alright, but they aren't ones that I would usually replay over and over again."
4,A gem. A fan favorite and for good reason.,"This disc is cool. It's not my favorite by Mariah but it is pretty good and contains some of her staple songs. ""Honey"", ""My All"" and ""Breakdown"" were hits. The dreamy ""Fourth Of July"", sexy ""The Beautiful Ones"", thoughtful ""Close My Eyes"" and powerful ""The Roof"" are some of my favorite tracks here.Sensual, sexy and very R&B; with little pop, Mariah's 1997 disc is solid. Look toDaydreamandThe Emancipation of Mimifor more enjoyable efforts overall. This is my second time reviewing this disc but this is just a quick run through. Plus my favorites have changed pretty drastically I think.4.4 stars.DOWNLOAD:""The Roof""""My All""""Breakdown"" &""Close My Eyes"""
2,its ok,i purchased this cd because i thought it would be a classic but it is not. even though i still like it it is not better than music box or daydream.
5,her greatist work till this day!,"this is her GREATIST WORK TILL THIS DAY!!!every song is just more amazing then the other""lamb"" forever,jesse from israel"
4,Mariah Finally Spreads Her Wings And Does Her Own Thing!,"Long Story Short:Mariah divorced Tommy,Mariah wrote about it, making her most creative&personal album to date.Sure,a lot of her albums(before&later)may have the same exact concept,but this album actually showcases her TRUE feelings outside of love.Ms.Carey also explores a new genre:R&B/Hip-Hop.And,suprisingly,she does it almost greatly,two showcases of that being ""Breakdown(featuring Krayzie Bone and Wish Bone)"" and ""The Roof"" taking samples from ""Shook Ones"" by Q-Tip.And,like I said,she showcases her true feelings,one back-up of that being the highlight of the album ""Close My Eyes"",talking about her childhood and her past.The song shows you that she is a true songwriter and makes you respect her more than you ever have.Aside from the album being about one concept Mariah always does,and doing too much sampling,this is a good effort from Mariah and you should really give it a chance."
3,"OK, but not as good as her previous albums.","I used to be a big Mariah fan, and own all of her albums up to this one, but I won't be purchasing any more. Yes, there are a few good songs on here, such as ""Butterfly"" and ""My All"", but the album has too much of a hip-hop flavour for my tastes. But I do respect her for doing what she wants....all artists have a right to change and grow. And I know this album appeals to a lot of people, which is cool. But for me, I much prefer her older albums like Music Box and Fantasy."
4,Contains many beautiful songs,"This album has a lot of beautiful songs and AC chart toppers. Songs like Butterfly, The Beautiful Ones, Whenever You Call, Honey, Fourth Of July, Breakdown, and Babydoll are my favorites. I have been listening to this album for a long time and it never fails to bring maximum satisfaction. Do yourself a favor and buy this album, okay! Bye."
3,"OK, but definitely not her best.","This is the first album where Mariah really started submerging herself in hip-hop. This is a likeable album, though not near as good as her first album or MUSIC BOX. ""Honey"", ""My All"" and ""Butterfly"" are probably the songs people know best from this album. ""Honey"" is a grooving hip-pop track, while both ""My All"" and ""Butterfly"" are ballads that soar. Other noteworthy tracks are ""The Roof"", a sassy, sexy track, ""Close My Eyes"" and ""Outside"", both personal ballads. ""Whenever You Call"" and ""Beautiful Ones"" are pleasing to my ears, while ""Breakdown"" is OK. One thing, I wish she'd sing her songs and not mumble them. I had to look at the lyrics the first time I heard it, and I don't usually do that! It towers over RAINBOW, though."
5,Great for real music fans,"I am an absolutely fanatic Mariah fan, but this is probably the album for music lovers in general, probably one of the greatest albums ever written. Mixing soul, RnB and pop, adding ballads and more up-tempo numbers with one or two adult contemporary numbers, this album has it all. The emotion felt put into this album is undeniable and inspiring. Whether a fan or not, buy this album as it is both sophisticated and lyrically complete. A true classic"
5,Smooth as Honey....,"To think i bought this album over 5 years ago, and I still find it beautiful each time i hear it. Mariah probably has one of the most beautiful, impressive voices I have ever heard. Butterfly is my favorite Mariah Carey Album though, because it has some of the most inspiring, soulful, and heartfelt tracks you could ever ask for. ""My all,"" she sings her heart out on, and her voice just goes right through you. ""Butterfly"" is very R&B but completly inspiring. My favorite tune on here thoug would have to be ""Close My Eyes,"" which really gets inside your emotions. ""I still feel like a child when I look at the moon, maybe I grew up a little too soon. Mariah also writes her own songs, and I have to give her credit for that. What this cd offers for you is heartful, soulful, heartpouring emotional tracks. Along with funky, dance r&b hits. This cd was definetly one of the best from the 90's, and is a classic pop album."
5,One of Mariah's best!!!!!!!,"This cd was great,the sound of her voice was excellent.This was one of my favorite cd's ever. You all betterwatch out because Mariah is on fire!!!!!!!!!!"
2,She isn't the R&B/Hip Hop kinda girl.,"In this CD Mariah tries to add some new sounds like she's part rapper.(gag me with a spoon!) She really does need to stick to her original style of music. Fantasy...now that was a great song...and still is. When I got Butterfly I had only heard two songs...Honey and Butterfly. Honey is all right and Butterfly is a little on the boring side. The rest of the songs sound wrong for her style of voice. She has a beautiful voice, but she need to find the right stlye of music to sing to. I don't recomend this CD for previous Mariah fans. It isn't what you expect!"
2,A Giant Step Backwards,"After watching American Idol tonight, and watching and hearing Mariah's newest release - a truly moving number - I'm ready to get back in her corner. It's been awhile.As a huge Mariah Carey fan, I had always bought all of her albums, But this album, Butterfly, turned me off so much it took a long time to overome it. The opening song, Honey, was so bad, and the video so suggestive and vulgar,that I was turned off for years, and haven't bought a Mariah album since.I know that wasn't fair - though not unlike the downturn another favorite, Olivia Newton-John took for several albums. But she has matured in recent years, and is again one of my favorites. So maybe the Mariah I missed is back. I still cannot recommend this album - I believe it is by far one of her worst.But Mariah is still an incredible talent, and ""Bye Bye"" is so good, I may give ""Butterfly another chance!!!"

1,STINKS!,"This album is a real stinker, there's not really much singing on it, just her humming a lot of nothing (but then,she's a no-talent anyway)...a waste of money, wish I hadn't bought, will be selling--any takers?"
1,Size Misunderstood,I was looking for a full size croquet set that could be played indoors. This is a mini sized set. The quality is very nice (maybe not $70 nice) but not what I needed. The manufacturer's website titles this item as mini but the Amazon site does not. I will be returning this item. Don't waste shipping and handling money unless you want a conversation piece that plays on a tabletop.
3,"Strong, solid set of songs","A friend and fellow Church fan bought this cd for me. At first listen I thought it strange, but with each subsequent listen I've gained further appreciation for the blend of styles it represents. It's easy to tell what Kilbey brings to the table and which parts come from McLennan, and while they're stylistically different, they mesh well together and share a common thread.My favorite song is Cousin/Angel. I'd like to locate the previous recording released by Jack Frost, and I look forward to further collaboration from these two gents."
4,not frosty,"Fans of Steve Kilbey and Grant McLennan/the Go-Betweens will enjoy this eclectic album. The more you listen, the more you think this is a crash of the Go-Betweens and the Church with some rock, some edge. It is more of a grower too, so don't give up after the first listen."
4,A hot album for Jack Frost,"On this album, the duo Steve Kilbey and Grant McLennan have matured greatly since their last self titled album, Jack Frost. On their first album, which I loved, they sang their lyrics separately, but on this new album, they interweave their voices so it is almost impossible to tell which singer is which. They have blended their voices well and also added heavier and rich guitar layers to the music. With every listen, the songs on this album get better and better. This disk reminds me of the Re-Formation disk that was made by members of The Church - Steve Kilbey, Peter Koppes, and Tim Powles. What a great partnership that you can hear on the album."
5,Wonderfully quirky,"Jane is an amazing girl with an amazing life in London. She somehow acquires three lovers, gets pregnant and doesn't know which one is the father, and then asks herself who she really loves. This book is a slice of life, very well written, with great characters. I hated for it to end. I bought it back in the...70s? I can't even remember when, but I've always wondered what happened to the author. She should have written more!"
5,Witty and fun and moving,"I've loved this novel ever since picking it up decades ago when we were both young.Information on Dee Wells, who passed away in 2003, here:http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2003/jul/23/guardianobituaries.booksI am under the impression that sometime in the late 70's, I saw a film version of this novel, but haven't been able to verify its existence."
4,good but inconvenient,"love all the kinerase products. this is good for refreshing the face, but since it's a spray it's not easy to apply. i spray it in my hands then put on my face and i end up losing a lot of the product.i did like to use it in the summer when lotions melt and get greasy on the face."
3,It's okay,"I bought this two years ago to use as a hydrating agent for my skin. However, every time I spray it on my face, some of it tends to get to my eye and it really sting the eyes. Even if your eyes are close you'll still feel the stinging sensation. It is very uncomfortable especially when you want to feel refreshed and rejuvenated. I haven't even finished the bottle yet because I hate the stinging sensation. Instead, I switched to the MAC hydrating spray and theirs doesn't sting. It actually feels alot better than Kinerase."
5,The Amazing Clayderman,"I simply cannot decide which of his albums is the best. The man is absulutely amazing, I can't get enough of his music. This particular CD is awesome. The orchestra behind him is just so so complimentary to his piano."
3,Price is way off,"I bought this for my son at a store. The game itself is fine, it's checkers. The quality is fine. But I wouldn't pay $39 for a cardboard board and plastic pieces with stickers you have to put on. If you're going to pay that much get a nice wooden set or something."
2,This isn't Elemint!,"Ok, I bought this song because I had just downloaded ""Born Fresh"" for free and thought it was great so why not give the guy some money for this song... turns out, it's not even the same guy. Not only was it not who i thought it was, it sounds like poorly written wanna be Bone Thugs to me(I might not be the best judge, but thats my take on it). Then I started wondering why this guy calls himself ""Elemint"", I mean I get why Elemint calls himself that(a play on the word ""mint"", because he is FRESH, hence the full name Elemint B. Fresh)but after listening to this track I am pretty sure that this guy just spelled element wrong. Maybe I wouldnt have thought it was so bad if I hadn't expected someone else, but at the end of the day I have to say I was upset with my purchase. In short, don't buy this song, go download Born Fresh, it's free and actually well done! Also, who ever gave this song 5 stars either has bad taste and low expectations or is in the group, because at best it's a 3."
5,the hottest album from the street.,this is the first album to bring real street sounds and next level music to the market. its a wake up call for southern rap artists to come wit it and stop PLAYIN. I have never heard an album like this before..it is a breath of fresh air for the rap world....thank God!
4,Good Information for Beginners,"Good book for anyone just getting started with earthbag building. Has many finesse tips as well. If anything, they wrote this with a bit too much detail in the bulk work, but it saves time in finishing. Certainly recommend this book for both detail and overview of this building technique."
5,Build your house with soil,This book goes in to detail of every step. some neat designs to get your creative juices flowing. Highly Recomended
5,A MUST READ for people into green construction!,"It's about time people wake up to the inexpensive, real opportunities available in making homes from earth bags. What a great idea (wish I thought of it!)"
4,The Perfect Primer and Beginners Guide to EarthBag homes,"I wasn't expecting a be-all and end-all book when I ordered this item; however, I was beyond impressed with all of the thorough information packed into this paperback book. The authors Kaki Hunter and Donald Kiffmeyer wrote this with the beginner in mind as well as those totally unfamiliar with construction basics. Though this book has pretty much everything you need (resources info too!), you can never get enough information on this wonderful type of earth-friendly construction!"
4,What a joy,I understood it all. I have no experience with building of this nature but now am desiring to do. Enough for the moderate novice of building to understand the details and feel confident in attempting it himself. I have already recommended this to others.
2,who is johnny5dm?,"I wish i could find ""johnny5dm""s article on taking apart the mouse. I am having major problems with mine. the left button acts like i am constantly double clicking and the scrool wheel wont roll upwards. I do like the look and feel and he buttons are situated in nice places, but for 60 bucks (which was what i paid for it at the time) I wish it would have lasted me longer than a few years. I have ordered a new mouse to replace this one, but would still love to take it apart and work on it. SO, if anyone knows where ""johnny5dm""s article is, i would greatly appreaciate it"
2,A bad piece of machinery!!,"First of all I would strongly encourage looking at a different mouse this this shameful piece of plastic. I paid near [price] for this mouse when it first came out expecting dazzling results. I got nothing--it stopped working after about 2 months of normal use. I couldn't believe it!! There was no way I, myself could fix it--there's no lint jamming it, and there is no ball to check and see if it's secure. The layout of the mouse was OK-I liked the additional buttons. It is specifically designed for a right handed user as you can see. I thought I needed a new mousepad. And I got one. It continued to be jumpy just before it died. I was cleaning out my desk and just through the sorry thing into the garbage. I returned to my normal ball mouse and am skeptical of ever buying an optical again-And if I do it won't be a Microsoft!!!"
4,almost perfect,I love this mouse. It works great. It Has five buttons( for whatever reason you might use them for. the only probvlem is its huge.
1,Doesn't work with Netscape on Windows ME,"It's a really cool mouse, does not skip, and the two extra buttons for back/forward are great. The only problem is that they don't work with Netscape on Windows ME, so for me it's useless on my new Windows ME system. Microsoft admits that it's a known bug (Article ID: Q274796, search Knowledge Base for IntelliMouse, type ""Netscape"" as your query). Naturally, they don't know when it will be fixed..."
4,"Nice, but go with the Optical version instead.","The Intellimouse Optical does everything the Explorer does, but it's smaller (Explorer is huge) and can be used for right or left hand too. The plastic used to make the Explorer also feels cheaper than the one used for the Optical. Overall, though, it's a good mouse."
5,Much easier to use,"This mouse is so much easier to use when browsing websites, saving a lot of time and energy on your hand, especially when you tend to go Back and Forward frequently. Well worth the buy."
5,Awesome Mouse,"I got this mouse a couple of days ago through Amazon. It is excellent. It is very accurate to your movement with the mouse. It has a neat feature for web viewers to use the two side buttons as a Back and Forward feature, there are also several other things the two side buttons can do like closing out programs( in stead of clicking the X each time). It is also very useful for scrolling down on website with it roller disk on the top. I would strongly reccomend anyone who wants to have a VERY EASY to use mouse with several helpful features to get this one."
1,Intellimouse SUX!,"Boy I was happy when I bought the mother of allmices. ""Now I don't have to clean the ball anymore"". Well, I did not have to clean the ball. But after 4 months of using the mouse, it just freezes and doesn't move the pointer! On my Mac, it kills the USB keyborad which means a hard reset. On the intel, it spares the keyborad. It takes 4 month for my regular $10 mouse to die and time for a replacement or cleaning the internals..."
5,Intellimouse Explorer--functional and sleek!,"Considering this was a major improvement of my hardware, I have superlatives for it. It is easily installed. It fits to the contours of the hand. I like placing my mouse on my leg when I use it. The control is fantastic. The buttons are easily adapted to personal preferences. Navigating on websites (including Amazon) is so much easier. I have used various mouse devices, but Microsoft has once again proven their place in the technology. The last big plus--Amazon.com's price! I could not find a price that even came close. PS My son calls refers to it as ""cool mouse!"""
5,I've always hated using a mouse...but I love this one!,"I have always hated using a mouse, but I love this one. I've been using it for about 2 weeks. As some reviewers have already noted it is larger than the mouse it replaced. I think that is a plus. Maybe the kids won't find it as comfortable as some of the smaller ones, but I am an adult with an adult size hand.The overall responsiveness of the mouse makes it a pleasure to use. It is ""tight"" like the steering on a new car.The 2 internet buttons have helped speed me up... I seem to be forever returning to that prior page.As to price, I may not be as diligent a price shopper as some internet users, but I did check Staples, and Comp USA, and found that the amazon.com price to be the best. I suppose that this will come down with time.Overall, if you are looking to replace your old mouse, I suggest that you consider buying this one."
5,No more mousicide.,If you are shopping for the best mouse...the search is over. MS has made up for its bloatware by developing some great hardware. From Gamers to Photoshop users...the accuracy is topnotch...the 4 buttons and scrollwheel make surfing fun and faster(with built on back button).You cant go wrong with this one.
2,"Neat concept, bad design","After extensive use I found that this mouse caused minor RSI pain. The shape is just too bulky and difficult to work with. In addition to this the mouse buttons suffer from the same problem I have had with other Microsoft mice: the buttons are poor quality. Sometimes when I press the button and drag, it releases before I let my finger up. I bought a Logitech mouse and have had no problem."
3,It has it's ups and downs.,"I got one of these things about 3 months ago. It is definately much more accurate and smooth, I can no longer play an FPS game without it. Also, I think the larger size is more comfortable once you get used to it. However, I've had some problems with the side buttons when I try to assign keys to them (i.e. button 5 = page up), and it has done things I didnt want it to do. More importantly, a few days ago (only after 3 months of owning it) the mouse just went dead. My computer says it cannot detect a mouse connected to my computer. I've tried everything-- replugging it, reinstalling the software, I've even opened it and checked to see if anything in side was broken or blocked. Now I'm back to using my regular mouse, and I'm hesitant to buy a new IntelliMouse Explorer."
4,Excellent mouse,"Good points: Nice tracking, very accurate, and doesn't need cleaning. Wheel works great. Looks cool.Bad points: Doesn't have the rubber siding like the Intellimouse Pro, also not a good shape if you are used to picking up the mouse as part of your usual mousing operations."
3,Don't Get Ripped Off!,"Don't spend the extra money on the intelli mouse explorer, just buy the intellimouse. They both have 5 buttons, and they're both optical. And in all honesty, the intellimouse's button placement is far better than that of the explorer. Plus the intellimouse isn't as bulky, allows for right or left handed use, and the best part, intellimouse is 20 dollars cheaper.I own both mice (explorer at home, intellimouse at work0. I'll just say that other that the size and the button config, the explorer is just a waste of 20 bucks."
5,Love it!,"When I first unpacked this mouse, I wasn't impressed. The lightweight feel (due mainly to the lack of a roller ball) certainly made it seem cheap. After using it for less than a day, though, I'm hooked! It glides along my desktop much easier than my IBM Scrollpoint mouse did, the rollerwheel makes scrolling a pleasure, and the buttons have a solid, precision feel to them. One of my favorite features: depress the roller wheel for a brief second, and an up/down icon appears on screen. Next, to automatically scroll through a document, simply move the mouse towards the top of the screen to scroll upward, or move it towards the bottom to scroll downward. The farther the mouse pointer is moved from the up/down icon, the faster the scrolling will be.I'm left-handed, but have no trouble using the mouse with my right hand.A winner from Microsoft, and definitely worth the money!"
2,"mouse is cool, but software is not.","I love the mouse, but installing the software slowed down my system. I often find myself lifting the mouse to reset the cursor because it disappears or gets stuck. Perhaps it's just not optimally suited for my Sony Vaio laptop."
1,What's wrong with left-handers,I saw this item and was initially excited - I had at last found my husband's final Christmas gift. Then I saw the features and it is exclusivly for right handed people. Please be wary if you buy this and have any left handed people in your life that may use your computer - it will be very frustrating for them
3,Needs improvement,"I purchased this mouse because I had worn down the scroll wheel on my other one. I do a lot of work with mapping programs, designing boundries, etc. I zoom in and out a lot and I must say that the scroll wheel on this mouse is excellent. The rest of the has a few shortcomings in accuracy though. Because of the design of the plastic stoppers on the bottom I can't just move it a very little bit from the mouse being at rest. It jumps, for those familiar with physics, to overcome static friction it takes a larger force than to overcome fritcion when an object is in motion, which results in the mouse always going to far. Also, every once in a while, usually about once every few hours the mouse skips to the lower right hand corner of my screen for no apparent reason. I have a few scratches on my desk and this could be the problem, or it could be the fact that I slightly pick up the mouse every once in a while."
5,I love the IntelliMouse Explorer,This mouse is great! I find it very comfortable and easy to use. I would not recommend this mouse if you use your left hand to mouse around! It is not designed to work with lefties from my experience. I really like that it works on any surface. A must have if you read long documents.
1,The only thing this mouse has going for it is it looks cool.,I bought this mouse mainly because it looked cool......bad mistake....This mouse gets anoying..You cannot do acurate pointing with it because it is big and really light feeling.Don't buy this mouse.Its a waste of too much money and it just isnt as good as the average mouse..
1,"great mouse, but why so much $?","this is so expensive because of that stupid video game console that Microsoft is making. they have spent bilions on it, and the market analists say they won't profit from it for 5 years, so they need money. i am happy with it otherwise, but i should have gotten an IBM again."
4,great mouse,"I liked this mouse for two main reasons. One it is optical which means i don't have to worry about cleaning it and i get more accurate mouse movements for when i edit images with photoshop.I also liked it because it has extra buttons on the side where your thumb rests. It took some getting used to but now when i go to work and i see a boring logitech with no scroll wheel and a mouse ball on the bottom i feel out of place. I also love the buttons for web browsing. Instead of placing my cursor to the top left i can just use my thumb as the back button.and not to mention the extra buttons use in games. i can reload and jump with my mouse instead of the keyboard.this thing is great.the only gripe i have is the fact that it lets go of the button when i lift it up when i have the button depressed. i have to do this because of my limited mouse space.Other than that i can't think of anything wrong with it. It feels, looks, and functions wonderfully. Highly recommended."
2,A fine mouse but too pricey,"I won't pull punches, the mouse is great. I delivers on just about all of it's advertised features. Of course it still won't work perfectly on every surface. Felt mouse pads are still the best. But I honestly don't think all those nifty features make it worth nearly three times the price of your standard mouse"
5,THE BEST MOUSE......EVER,"This mouse is by far the greatest one ever. it doesnt skip, it flows smoother then any other mouse. It lets you program the buttons, and the two extra buttons on the side add so many extra features especially on the internet. It is absolutely a must have if you are a mac owner too."
4,"A good mouse, but it's still a mouse.","The IntelliMouse Explorer fixes a number of problems traditional mice have experienced, and adds some good features. The wheel is still welcome, of course, and the added two buttons make web browsing more efficient and faster than before. Not having to clean the ball or have a mouse pad are both nice features as well. However, the fact remains that, for all its improvements, the IntelliMouse is still just a mouse. If all you need is a plain mouse, you can find one for much cheaper. If, however, you do lots of things with documents and web pages, the extra cost of the IntelliMouse Explorer is worth it."
4,Great mouse but too big for smaller hands.,I have large hands so it is great for me bu I have seen other with smaller hands have trouble moving it around. Also the 2 side buttons could have been placed better. Even with large hands like mine the button toward the front is a little too inconvenient to be useful.
1,EXPLORER MOUSE BY MICROSOFT,"I AM A AUTO CAD DRAFTMAN. I USE A MOUSE 8 TO 10 HRS A DAY. I THOUGHT I WOULD BUY THIS MOUSE BECAUSE OF THE RIGHT-UP. BUT MY EXPERIENCE WITH THE MOUSE IS NOT GOOD. I HAVE NEVER BROUGHT BACK ANYTHING I HAVE BOUGHT FOR MY COMPUTER, BUT THIS MOUSE IS GOING BACK TOMORROW. ANYONE WHO USES A MOUSE FOR HOURS ON END WILL SOON FIND OUT THIS MOUSE IS HARD ON ONE'S HAND. THE ACTION IS NOT SMOOTH AT ALL, AND HARD TO CONTROL IN PRECISE POINTS. I AM GOING BACK TO THE OTHER LEADING BRAND OF MOUSE TOMORROW.FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO WILL PURCHASE THIS DEVICE....GOOD LUCK"
2,What about the lefties?,"OK, OK, so I'm sure it's a great mouse, it certainly looks chic and seems to work well, according to reviewers and customers alike, but would device manufacturers please, oh please! try and remember that a sizable portion of the population are left handed? How difficult would it be to invert the mold and produce these gadgets for us as well? In these days of CAD/CAM it shouldn't take the designers long to produce the necessary goods!Sure, the production run would be smaller, but goodwill is important too!Trackball manufacturers have been designing their products neutrally for years, only recently have some jokers (Logitech, in particular) built right-hand-only devices."
5,i like this mouse. yes yes. shut up i'm talking... hello?,"so very nice to be able to move smooth. the wheel and thumb buttons are great for internet creeping and it looks cool glowing red in a dark room. much better than my old mouse for working in graphics programs cuz its smoother and more sensitive; plus no mouse pad is needed so that won't tie you up and you'll never run out of pad in the middle of drawing a line. yo, my only problems with it was that when i ran it via usb cable thru my keybord(so far away) it was glitchy and sucked but i just run it from the mouse port and it's gravy. perhaps you will like it too."
3,4 Reasons Why I Replaced this Mouse in 30 Days:,"1) It was too big for my workspace. 2) It was too big for my hand. 3) It glows day and night (do not put it in your bedroom unless you need a night-light). 4) It has an accessory button that your thumb will rarely miss. Having said all that about the ergonomics, the technology remains awesome and truly qualifies as a breakthrough. However, the more basic IntelliMouse is a better unit for less money."
3,Functional Buttons Yet Awkward Design,"The Intellimouse Explorer is an iffy area with me. I purchased it thinking it would be a simple but effective addition to my computer since I have a cable modem. This was a good choice since the back and forward buttons and the wheel are great for working with Internet Explorer. However, the size of the mouse is awkward and I am not sure how to hold it properly still. I also found that the cursor jumps around because of that optical mouse feature. I think it may be that I need a new mousepad but it is an annoyance. A major complaint is that I purchased the mouse because of how it looks and the paint on it is wearing off from a shiny silver to a dull gray. The Microsoft words are gone and almost everyone in the family uses the computer it is on. I would recommend you a Logitech one for shape and a good optical mouse compatible mousepad. I am barely satisfied with this mouse and for the price, I would get the Logitech one (looks really cool) if I could change it."
2,"Pretty, But Not Reliable","I purchased an IntelliMouse Explorer in Dec. of 1999. This mouse tracks beautifully and has such a pretty red glow when in use, but there are plenty of shortcomings when it comes to this mouse. 1) This mouse it HUGE. If you have a small hand this mouse will be extremely awkward to use. 2) It can not track too fast. If you like to keep your mouse sensitivity low, it will not track properly. 3)My final quarrel: this mouse BREAKS. I have had this mouse for aprox. 8 months and I am on my third one. Microsoft warranty's this mouse with a 1 year free replacement but, who wants to wait 2-3 weeks for a replacement.Do yourself a favor, buy a mouse that last longer then a few months."
2,Oversized Mouse = Clumsy Use,"My hands are huge and I think this mouse is way too big. The design raises your palm to high for commanding use. The optical eye is great just like a normal mouse, but it can't be raised off a surface at all. A rolling ball mouse still tracks and spins when lifted off its surface--not good for gaming. I think the design had this problem in mind, so there are no edges and the base is wider. I think Microsoft knows this so they have made a smaller one with optical eye so get that one."
3,GREAT mouse -- EXCEPT crappy cord!,"This is my second Explorer after the first one succumbed to the ""faulty wiring"" problem like so many before. Now *this* one is starting to go as well. I decided to read through these reviews and I've noticed the trend continuing here as well. What gives? My previous ""regular"" Microsoft Intellimouse lasted two years before I found the Explorer Optical. I enjoy the optics, but after losing two in an 8-month period, I really doubt the product's reliability and construction. If Microsoft could give me a reasonable explanation why seemingly so many of these mice are dying from the same reason, I'd be a little happier. Instead, I'm forced to buy something else."
4,A winning technology w/ a questionable package.,"I've been using this product for about 2 months now, with no problems. It works capably on every flat surface on my desk. No problem tracking when running off the mouse pad and on to the desk. I would have prefered more weight (one of the best attributes of the classic Microsoft mouse). I could have done without the glitzy, unneccesary red light too. The shape is also a bit of a departure. It's longer and flatter so the hand is more streched out over the mouse. The adjustments to this product have been minor when compaired with its flawless tracking ability. Will it be my last mouse? Probably not. But this product has real potential to far exceed the useful lifespan of my last 5 mouses, which were all retired because the trackball became un-cleanable. There is another incarnation in the more classic package, but without the side buttons, which have proved very useful, esp for browsing. Note.. a PS-2 to serial adapter will not work."
2,Very disappointing,"This is an ok mouse if you do very light mouse work, it's nice as a novelty item and an ""wow look at that no mouseball"" item but if you use your mouse hard or quickly forget about this! I play games and do a lot of graphics work on my computer and noticed that the mouse would lose it's plcae on the screen if i moved my mouse at any speed above normal, even at normal speed the mouse has a tendency to leap of in odd directions, which is very annoying when you do precise graphics work. I tried about 15 different surfaces and even tried both the USb and ps/2 interfaces both yielded the same results. Unless something was wrong with my mouse i recommend you steer clear of this"
3,Good but it has a shot life.,"This is one of the best mice I have ever used. You can tell by the other reviews that the extra progamable buttons are very handy, and that it's ergonomic design is also very comfortable.But one thing.... After about a month or so using this product, it dies. There is no cable stress protecting the cord where it meets the mouse. So both of my mice (After the first I had to have another) are now dead. I dont know if microsoft has done anything about this problem with later models but for now you need to make a choice between the best mouse you will ever use for a month or $60 bucks untill you spend it."
2,Great While it Lasted,"I received this product in mid-May, by Mid-August it inexplicably stopped working. It had power, the driver was fine, but the cursor doesn't move. ...I'm out of luck. I will say that I thought it was great, right up until it stopped working. Let the buyer beware!"
1,Microsoft B75-00001 IntelliMouse Explorer (PS2/USB),I bought one - did not have the correct software and does not work even close to as advertised. I took it back for a refund. An overpriced piece of junk as far as I am concerned. My Genius Netscroll+ is a far superior product at a fraction of the price. I only gave it one star because there is no 1/2 a star.
2,What about lefties?,"Ok, I haven't used this mouse, but I did read all about it here. I am left-handed, and do use my mouse with my left hand, particularly when i really need to control it. For something called the INTELLI-mouse, implying intelligence, it certain left out thought of a large number of computer users. Next time, Bill, think about us too."
2,OUCH MY HAND HURTS!,"Hi, I agree with the previous poster who said his hand hurt from using this mouse. The optical tracking seems to work pretty well. However, the shape makes my mouse click finger hurt. Also it feels light and flimsy. I am a big fan of the rollerball intellimouse in terms of feel (heavier), comfort, etc. This mouse feels ""cheap"" I guess. Came with a computer I ordered unfortunately. If I could put the optical tracking on and intellimouse I'd be all set."
2,Just... not right,"I wanted to like this mouse, what with the cool red light, but I use a mouse all day, so comfort and accuracy are much more important, and on those scores, it really doesn't work that well. First off, some people think it is too big, but I find that I have to cramp my hand to hold it, and with sides that slope inward, there is no comfortable way to grasp it. OK you think, so I'll rest my hand on it and just slide it around. But no, if you do that, you'll find you're constantly pressing buttons (especially the right one) you never meant to. In the end, you find yourself trying to squeeze it and hovering your hand above it to avoid false clicks; all of which is very tiring. So, sadly, thumbs down from me. Back to Logitech MouseMan, which IMO is a much better ""fit""."
2,Ayurveda,"I was truly disappointed in this book. I bought it so that I could understand Ayurveda, but this writter discounts the true principles. He refers to Vata, Pita and Kapha as Body Types A,B and C. I think he should call it by the proper names and not try to take shortcuts. It is not a well written book on the subject. If you are interested in Ayurveda, I highly recommend Deepak Chopra's ""Perfect Health"". Not only does Chopra cover the topic completely, his book is inspiring. Perfect Balance is unrealistic. It recommends that people take teaspoons of spices and herbs daily. While the true way of following Ayurveda is to cook with the spices and herbs in the food. I do not recommend this book. It has some helpful information, but not enough. Why read more then one book on the subject? Deepak Chopra's book covers it all and he also has a website that offers Ayurveda products."
3,Vegan Help?,"Although I found this book to be easy to read and the test to be thorough enough to determine my body type, I had a really hard time figuring out how to adapt to it, since the diet prescribed was not vegan. I don't know, maybe I can't be vegan and practice ayurveda?"
1,"Bad, bad, bad timer.","I bought three of these timers, and they are all broken. They'll turn on, but never turn off. As the long and helpful review says, you need a good connection to neutral for these to function. I went so far as to remove a gfi from the circuit to make sure I had a no interruptions in my neutral. Still didn't work. So I went even further, and strung a wire all the way from my neutral bus in the breaker box to the neutral wire at the switch. Still didn't work. (Would turn on, but never turn off.)I tried this setups with fewer and fewer potential problems (switched from a combo shower fan + florescent light to just the light, to just a single incandescent bulb. Still turns on and never turns off.Tried these combinations on all three switches. None works. What a waste of a day.Save yourself the trouble."
4,Pre Annie Haslam Renaissance,"This was originally a project of Yardbirds lead singer, Keith Relf, his sister Jane, and Yardbird Jim Mc Carthy. This is their first 2 albums on one set and it's pretty good. The success of this was a lot below the Yardbirds and the 3 moved on after this while Annie Haslam, John Tout, Michael Dunford took over and their first release was ""Prologue"". This is much more in the spirit of ""Prologue"" than later Renaissance works. The vocals are shared and not dominated by one voice here and it's good progressive rock. Fans of Annie's version of the band and progressive rock fans in general should enjoy this. With Yardbirds fans, they may not as it really nothing like a Yardbirds set."
5,It's the best!,"I grew up in Europe and am so happy that I can buy this here now, even at this price. A little piece of home, yummy!!!"
1,Apex oxford stretcher spandex & nylon shoe,"Shoes were one size too large in fit. No support at all, like slippers.Problem with the 15% restock fee. It cost me almost $32 in postage & handling and restock just to try these shoes that didn't fit."
2,Honor?...sure,"This movie puports to be about honor. Sure, if honor entails leaving one's spouse and children at the mercy of one's rapacious enemies while going off and hiding in the hilltops. Rob Roy as portrayed by Liam Neeson is a pompous, foolish humorless dolt who values the safety of his loved ones less than he does his dubious principles. Jessica Lange plays the Supportive Little Woman; her entire performance consists of saying 'How fine you are to me, Robert McGregor', and getting raped. On the bright side, Tim Roth is given the utterly enviable task of tormenting the annoying protagonists, and he does a brilliant job of it. He gets one star; the gorgeous scenery gets the other."
2,Marred by unnecessary rape scene.,"I remember seeing this years ago and thinking it had a lot of merit, a hero who refuses to slander and pays a high price. A well made movie with great acting and beautiful music and scenery. I thought about showing this to my boys, but the other reviewers reminded me of the unwatchable, unnecessary rape scene. The filmmakers did Tim Roth a disservice by thinking this was necessary to enhance his brilliantly evil performance. Brutish and clumsy, and fatal to an otherwise fine movie."
3,It's my opinion,"This movie has four ""scenes"" imparticular that are not appropriate for children. Dare I say not appropriate for me either, I can't watch them without blushing. I do fast forward them. I started out with two scenes and now am up to four that would make this movie a bad family flick. We bought the movie for the history content and it is too sad that hollywood has to make it so graphic with sexual content."
2,Ridicuouls,"The film was fencing about all right, until the last sword scene. To pretend that someone can halt an expert swordsman at bay by grabbing the blade of his sword with, of all things, his bare hand, so that the attacker can neither plunge it past his grip or pull it out, is just outrageously silly. That this simple point should have eluded most of the reviewers on this site is, to say the least, almost as amazing. It is so silly it just metastisises over any enjoyment one might have had of the whole. Incredible that any one seeing this Munchausen fib when it was shown at the theatre,wouldn't have risen for his seat whith a loud ""Oh, please, come on!!"""
1,Sex scenes a turn-off. I thought this was an action movie?,"I have the greatest respect for Liam Neeson as an actor. This movie does not come up to the standard I had associated with his work. He could have done much better in a leading role elsewhere. The movie starts out with a bit (and I do mean a bit) of action, a sex scene, then on to the villain, who is very good, whoever he is. Then back to more sex -- and I turned it off, threw it away. The title, Rob Roy, does not lead a viewer to expect an Outlander story line."
1,Boring and tiresome,"The cinematography is great, but the movie is boring, tiresome and vulgar. Save your time and money"
1,Rob Roy,"The DVD did not have any sound. Needless to say I was very upset and would never buy from this vendor or from Amazon again! I feel that I should receive a refund or at least a replacement movie.Signed, Very unhappy former customer"
5,rob roy,Thank you for the prompt sending of this movie. I have wanted it for so long and finally bought it for myself as a birthday gift!
5,Rob Roy,"Very pleased with the movie, glad we could get it on DVD. Service ordering and receiving was excellent. Thanks again"
4,Rob Roy,"If you are a fan of 18th century adventures,this is an excellent Scotish adventure film worth having in your home video or CD library."
3,good costume flick,"Any movie with the cast of this one has to be great--Neeson, Jessica Lange, John Hurt, plus, not so famous, Tim Roth. However, the script didn't come up to the greatness of the cast. The plot was all too predictable. I thought Neeson was a bid wooden. The exception was with Roth and Lange--the interplay of Neeson/Roth and Neeson/Lange made the movie as great as it could be. Certain scenes in movies become iconic--Steve McQueen and the racing car scene from Bullitt, Make my day,Katherine Hepburn in Lion in Winter with ""every family has its little ups and downs,"" the conclusion of Casablanca. The climactic sword fight in Rob Roy is one of those cinematic moments. I think this duel is the greatest sword fight scene in movies."
3,25% INTEREST for THREE MONTHS!!!!,"take that CitiBank... well for ol Rob he was given the special friends of Marquis discount of 20%, no wonder those folks were in continual poverty, would have enjoyed more history of the time than the slow steam of discontent for Archy n his ilk, like could ya hate a guy more, surprised he didn't shove bamboo up Rob's nails during his drag walk in gag n chains, what is with this sadism thing, enuff!!! we already hate him for raping the wife etc., soooo, the duels were kewl, Liam was marginal in some scenes, just too lumbering and accent unclear while others formidable and most handsome... he looks better in a German uniform imho, Jessica, never knew she could act that well, kudos cupcake! I never did take the time to watch this film due to the Braveheart comparison but am glad I did mostly for the absolutely stunning views of the Highlands, thank you for that, and that aspect pretty much sums up my recommend..."
5,"GREAT STORY, GREAT MOVIE",THIS IS ONE OF MY ALL-TIME FAVORITE MOVIES AND IT ALSO INVOLVES A LOVE STORY.
3,"nice sword fighting, but weak characters","This is a pretty good film. The photography is lush, the actors strikingly beautiful, and there are great action scenes. Unfortunately, the story and characters are rather simplistic stereotypes: Rob Roy is an upright, honest man of honor and justice, just like his wife; his adversary is a rapist, a thief, and a cruel brute with a talent for the blade and some pretty crude intrigue. Scotland of the time fits right into the myths of valor in poverty and the corruption of the court. There is absolutely nothing original about this production.By far the best thing about the film are the sword fights. Roy and his adversary have a great fight, indeed it is worth the price of admission. The unfortunate thing is that you have the rest of the film to sit through.Recommended, but skip to the fights."
3,Rob Roy movie,"The movie has much action and is a great adventure. Although I had ordered a used version, I now wish I had ordered a new movie. My movie had some white lines in it, and the voice at times seemed muffled. The picture at times also had wavy lines through the entire screen. But the movie was great anyways."
2,Unbelievable,"Splendid scenery, I grant you. I don't know how authentic the costumes were, but the filmmakers succeeded in dressing their male highlanders in kilts and tartans that looked like they actually could keep a guy reasonably warm in a chilly latitude. Nice to see a movie, too, in which the physical lovemaking is between two people faithfully married to one another. (The rape scene was hateful, though artistically defensible.) But at the end of the movie, the hero does something that is physically impossible. It really bothered me. The filmmakers could have given us a fully satisfactory conclusion without that. This was the crowning example of quite a number of implausibilities. If you haven't seen Kurosawa's The Seven Samurai, THAT has the last word in cinematic small-scale battle.I can hardly wait to re-read Walter Scott's novel, which, as someone else pointed out, has no overlap with this movie. Still in print after over a century and a half!"
2,sexual violence a turnoff,"I missed this movie in the theatres and was eager to see it. The acting, scenery, snd musical score were all superb. What turned me off was the ( as also stated by another reviewer) protracted rape scene. It was about as brutal as it gets and went on far too long. I think this was really unnecessary since ( when Tim Roth forced Jessica Lange accross the table) we all knew what was going on.Having been a victim of sexual violence, I was completely turned off by the prolonging of this scene. Totally unnecessary to do this."
3,Slow approach to high adventure,"Movie is too slow in parts, and could have been better made. I found the movie not very interesting. So, so movie."
3,Semi weak transfer,"Don't expect this to be like Braveheart. It is not as epic or grand. This is a more personal story that takes place between a small cast of characters. There is plenty of romance, intrigue, violence, revenge, and drama to please a wide variety of viewers; just don't go in comparing it to larger films. The tranfer is weak compared to other films, don't know if it is because it is less well known or what.Still worth a try."
3,"Often Very Good, And Often Pretty Bad","Liam Neeson is great in this role and Tim Roth is a villain for the ages, but Jessica Lange, with her ghoulishly inexpressive face and terrible fake accent was a detriment to the production. The good in Rob Roy had to do with the setting in the highlands of Scotland and the interplay between the despicable Roth and the heroic Neeson, and overall it was a fairly good period drama. The bad parts, other than the miscast Lange, were in the way the film moved slowly and deviated from the original story in ways that were distracting. This version of Rob Roy has thrilling moments and memorable scenes, but in its entirety enough mistakes were made to bring it down to about three stars."
4,Blu-ray worth the upgrade,"Please note: My review pertains only to the Blu-ray picture quality, not the plot of the film.It's been years since I last watched my DVD copy of Rob Roy. Most recently I decided to watch this very fine film only to be shocked at the horrible quality of the print. I've seen better quality prints from 70 year old films. When I learned that Rob Roy was being released on Blu-ray, at a very reasonable price, I decided to take a chance. I'm glad that I took that chance because the picture quality is so much better; it's not mind-blowing great, but compared to the blurry and grainy DVD the Blu-ray is a vast improvement. If you love this film, do yourself a favor and get the Blu-ray version."
5,You gotta love JOE,"Joe at his best, has been a long time favorite, go to disk. If you like Joe's other disks you'll love this one!"
1,Waste of money,"I purchased this item thinking that I could go from vga to dvi since my home tv does not support a VGA input. Well I got nothing, well not to really say nothing but all I heard was a beep like it was trying to work, but then nothing. I tried using this on another laptop that I own and again nothing, I thought it might just be the connection so I just went from DVI to my tv using my other laptop and that worked fine. I for some reason can not get this device to change the signal at all. So like the other person posted this is a waste of money.-AkWingnut"
1,Horrible Product!,This product did not work!!!! TV is RGB and Computer is DVI...connected and nothing. Waste of money. Save yourself the trouble and DON'T BOTHER ORDERING!
3,The reason for mixed reviews,It looks (and sounds) like this adapter works ONLY when your signal is coming in from DVI and going out to VGA. It DOES NOT seem to work when you try going in from VGA and going out to DVI. I bought it for the latter purpose and was disappointed also.
1,Doesn't work,"Simply put, it doesn't work. Really, it does not work. I am not tech savy so this is why I probably bought a useless product."
3,I got the wrong adapter,"figured I would put up this review just in case anyone else might be inclined to make the same mistake as I did. If you have a DVI port from your motherboard, and a VGA monitor, this will not work unless you have a DVI cable as well. I had to return it :/"
3,Did not work for my need,Tried using this to convert VGA over 100ft DVI cable but unfortunately it did not work. Maybe I needed one at both ends? The projector had DVI and VGA input and I did not want to run a new VGA cable. Had to anyway. This item shipped quickly and was exactly what I expected but I cannot attest to its use...
1,Adapter doesn't work,"I bought this adapter to connect my laptop to an Apple Cinema Display monitor. I was pleased by the quickness of the delivery, but when I tried to use the adapter, the computer didn't even register that I had plugged anything in. I don't know what purpose this adapter would have, but it didn't seem to match my need. I returned it quickly."
1,It does not work with dvi to hdmi,"It is fraud. I bought this connector because system suggestion with an hdmi - dvi cable. I put it between my laptop vga, dvi, and HDMI TV interface, and it did not work."
1,cables,this product does not meet with the desired objective the 'pin' potion is great the other end does not fit into my LCD screen at the back rather a disappointing choice altogether
3,Not working as I assumed it would.,"Despite a surprisingly fast delivery, it failed to work for what I ordered it for. I'm using an HDMI to DVI cable with this adapter. I assumed that it would allow me to display my PS3 via a VGA connection but either the product is faulty or I was misinformed prior to ordering."
1,Doesn't work,"This item doesn't work. I tried to use it with a DVI source to output to VGA. I'm an IT Manager and seller of electronics, so I tried every trick in the book. No dice."
1,Don't expect this to work. You may be disappointed.,"We got new HP ZR2440w monitors (the worst in the world) at work. The computer I have only has a VGA and an HDMI plug for monitors. USB input can also be used but that solution only results in a small subset of video resolutions of the other two options. Those of us that don't have DVI plugs on our computer were given a DVI to USB adapter module. and I thought if I replaced it with this I would get more resolution choices like the HDMI option. Instead it doesn't even see the monitor with this plug. If I unplug it I get a message that a monitor was unplugged, but when I plug it back in it doesn't see anything and the monitor shuts off. Maybe it works in other situations, but not this one."
1,Doesn't fit!,"Car cover not even close to fitting! Probable cause is they did not show a club cab, 4 door option on the Chev. 2001 S-10 LE Model, which is the one we own."
4,It's a pretty good book in the series,"According to my 9 year old (who's read the book recently), it's a pretty good book and something she'd like to try someday (staying in a cabin in the snow). As a parent, I've got to say it's nice to still have a few things in life that don't need to be CONSTANTLY monitored for content and to know that this series is one in which good wins out, hard work, persistance, and team work are rewarded, and family is still the most important thing in the world."
5,The new class,"Written by one of Tito's chief leaders who was with Tito from the days of WWII when their Partisans won out over other factions as a result of a civil war fought concurrently with WWII. After the war he helped build the Communist system, of which he was an adherent. Follow the man into disillusionment as he watches a new class of oppressor muddle his idealism; then he ultimately abandons the core principles of communism. As valuable and as useful today as the day it was written."
4,Satisfyingly cheesy fantasy metal,"If you're like me, you have an unhealthy thing for generic fantasy cave-aged cheese. I can't get enough of it. This album isn't actually that generic. The production is everything I could ask for. Not great by any stretch of the imagination, but provides some good atmosphere.The guitar-work here is solid. Some nice solos and memorable riffs. The drumming is pretty heavy and sits comfortably close to the foreground without getting overwhelming. This is a nice touch since a lot of times in this kind of music, the drums get pushed way to the back. The vocals are what you'd expect. Lyrics about warriors and swords sung in a thick Italian accent.Overall, I'm very pleased with this purchase. Then again, it was only $4. If you're into bands like Domine, Drakkar, Holy Knights and, of course, the Mighty Rhapsody (of Fire), then you will most likely enjoy this."
4,Silent Scope Done Right,"I played Silent Scope in the arcade. When it came out on PS2 I was dissapointed that it was not light gun compatiable. Now Konami has corrected it's mistake by making the X box version light gun compatiable. You get 3 great games in one package. I heard that the Silent Scope Light Rifle is horrible. If you are having problems calibrating it, go to your funcoland and get a pelican brand name extension. This solves the problem. As far as the light rifles performance, It is good. The kickback stinks,but who cares about kickback. It is fun to point the rifle at the tv and blast away at terrorists. I am so thrilled that Konami has brought all of the excitiment of 3 of its contemporary arcade games to x box. If you are a fan of arcade games but don't want to waste your money at the arcade, get this collection immeidatly!"
1,this game is junk,"although there are only 2 light gun games for the xbox - this and house of the dead, this game is lame. the graphics are so old and the light sensitivity of the game is horrible. i have the yobo boss blaster pistol and it works incredibly well with HOTD, but with this game, you have to have the brightness turned up so high that you can barely see the screen in order for the light gun to move smoothly across the screen. you cant have ANY background light to play the game. this game is not worth the money - thankfully i used a gift cert from my company to buy this, and not my own money."
5,Ollie,"I've always loved Oliver Reed and just had to have this book. He tells his story in his own words and has put some pictures in the book, as well."
2,a shallow grave candidate,"The other reviewers have described the plot for this mystery novel with skill. My review consists only of comments to assist new Jane Haddam fans.Do I think this novel is worth buying? No. Worth reading? Only for die-hard fans.If you feel you must read all of her novels, check this one out of the public library. I feel it is her weakest effort. Except for Gregor & Bennis (who are the only decent parts of the novel), the characters are all shallow and two dimensional. The murderer is obvious & more of a caricature than a character. Gregor gets quite testy with the games that his fellow inhabitants of the island are playing -- who could blame him? Not me. They are a shrill and unappealing group.Of all her titles that I have read, I like this one the least. My apologies to the author for this review! I generally like her work tremendously & have started buying her more recent work in hardback."
4,Cool Set,This is one of the most confusing ships to build for me. I love the structure but it will break easily. I like Yoda's hut. It comes with two good minifigs and two light sabres.
3,don't waste your money,"Overall this toy isn't worth $50. x-wing is cool, but certain parts fall off very easily. the lego yoda's hut is larger than scale compared to the movie one. In the movie luke has to crawl to get it, it's easy for him to fit in the lego one (which is kinda good, but kinda bad.) I'd say this is worth $20-$30, but no more. Many cooler legos for the same price"
4,x wing review,"In my opinon this is the best lego set made. It comes with luke,R2-D2,and yoda(who seems to be a rare minifig).Common sence should teel you that it comes with the x wing. It also comes with pieces to build yodas hut.The hut is not avalible anywhere else.So I hope this review was helpful."
4,LP to Digital CDs Recording System,This was a gift to my husband who has been converting our old LPs to CDs. He is having fun doing this while reminiscencing about the good ole days.
3,Digital Noise,"This product seems to insert a high frequency sound on top of the audio recording. While not audible to my ears, it is clearly heard by my wife and makes the recordings unlistenable."
4,audio technica at-lp2d,"works good so far, haven't had chance yet to really start converting my albums, so many tracks, so little time..........."
4,Poor instruction manual,"I had a hard time figuring out the volume control, and the instructions were very vague regarding setting it up. There are no instructions on how to use the Pyro software, so you have to look it up on line or just play with it until you figure it out. I also wish there were more ways to balance the sound.With all that said, once I started recording, my LP's sounded good once transferred to CD's. It's worth the $100 I paid for it, although I would have paid a little more for a better software system."
4,Audio Technica AT-LP2D LP-to-Digital Recording System,The turntable is easy to use and the recording quality is great considering that you are recording vinyl records. The software is easy to load but is severely lacking in documentation. To use the software takes hours to figure out if you are an experienced computer individual. If you want to speed up the process it would be best to go to the Cakewalk Pyro website to gain additional information.
5,great buy,"I looked for this item at other sites and found it at amazon with the best price.The software alone is worth the price but if you need a new turntable for those old records this is the one to get.It also has the ability to send the sound to your coumpter to make cds if you want to.The software makes it easy to use,[ just follow the instructions.]"
3,"Jack C. Eugene, Oregon","I really anticipated getting this product for Christmas and had great expectations for it. Perhaps too great. The problem I had was with the software. It was difficult to negotiate through the options. Each song has to be played individually on the turntable, which converts it to a WAV, file,then you make the corrections from the software, loudness, audio Efx, etc.. Then you can convert to an MP3 format for better quality, and then import to my itunes folder, and then finally you get to make a CD. It's not an impossible process, just tedious for my desire for instant gratification. Ihave albums that go back over 40 years and this has forced me to drag them out of storage and look at them. There was some pretty good music back there in the dark ages and I'm grateful I have a way to listen to thosetunes again"
4,Love Tunes,"Great turntable! Was easy for Hubby to install and am certainly enjoying my old vinyl. I do wish I could have found a turntable that would hold a ""short stack"". Hate having to go turn the record over after 20 minutes or so...miss listening to 4 or 5 at a time. But it hooked up easily to my system and really sounds great! Can't wait to be able to record them onto CD. Probably have time for that in 10 or 15 years when I RETIRE! Was certainly easy to order and got here in just a few days. Love ordering from Amazon!!"
1,Bah Humbug,"I too ordered this product on Dec. 1, was told by Amazon I would have it before Christmas, got conflicting emails about when it would ship, etc. I called about the conflicting emails and was told that they would actually have some in stock on 12/13 and to watch my email for the shipping notice. I actually looked elsewhere then and found them backordered everywhere. Today I am told my order is cancelled. Although usually the service is pretty good from Amazon, I really feel misled on this one. C'mon, Amazon, be upfront about product availability, esepcially at a time of year when many products are purchased as gifts and you're leaving us in the lurch!"
1,"Bah, humbug.",Look very close at the picture. It is just a turntable. There is nothing particularly COMPUTER-ish about it. Not a USB interface. It is a vanilla jack type plug in turn table. Period.But the software? Great? Huh?Beats me. Refuses to let me use it as it won't accept the serial number it provides. Maybe if my Ovaltine decoder ring were not lost...
2,warranty???,"I ordered this as a Christmas present,in September. I received an email from them that because this was an ""OPEN"" box item I would only recieve a 30 day guarantee, I reviewed my order and could not find anything that said this was an open box or only had a 30 day guarantee. I emailed them but never recieved a reply, how ever the merchandise arraive, with minor shipping damage, and I am now having my son-in-law, for whom it was intended at christmas, check it out early to make sure it works properly, so much for a christmas surprise.............be careful and double check ads for surprises............"
1,Suspected price manipulation,"I ordered this product through amazon for $104.99 in late November. Combined it with a one year electronics insurance policy. The order was split, I was charged for insurance and was told turntable would arrive between Dec 11 and Dec 15. On Dec 13 amazon sent an email saying order was cancelled. It doesn't appear in my order history. But I COULD order on on Dec 25 for $179. Original price not honored. This was going to be a christmas present... how sad."
1,GOOD LUCK GETTING THIS PRODUCT FROM AMAZON,I ONLY WISH THAT I COULD TELL YOU HOW GREAT THIS PRODUCT IS. I ORDERED THRU AMAZON WITH HIGH HOPES OF GETTING TO LISTEN TO SOME OF MY FAV ALBUMS. WHEN I ORDERED THE ITEM WAS LISTED AS IN STOCK----3 MONTHS LATER AND AFTER SEVERAL NEW ESTIMATED SHIPPING DATES I WAS FINNALY INFORMED THAT MY ORDER COULD NOT BE FULFILLED. SO BUYERE/WAITER BEWARE-DECEMBER AVAIABILITY IS NOT LIKELY.
1,Agree with postings and dropping the ball,This was my christmas present. I also e-mailed Amazon yesterday and was told it still had a shipping estimate of 12/11-15 then today I get the messages it's not going to be fulfilled and the order was cancelled. And as you say it's now 179.99 with a December ship date. This was all I asked for from my husband for Christmas.
5,Super tool for those of us with LPs!!,"I haven't felt an overwhelming need to write a product review before, but this is, by far, the best purchase I've made in a long time. It's simple to set up - works just like it's supposed to - has super help built in for tweaking any settings that may not be correct on the computer (line-in volume, etc.) .... I had it set up and recording songs in under 20 minutes... the software is great... Cakewalk is a leader in music software, so it's simple to use and works properly the first time through. I can't wait to spend the weekend listening and recording my old LPs.If you've been looking for a way to utlize your old LPs and hear all your favorite songs over again (and save them as MP3s to put on an iPod or your cell phone) THIS is the tool for you!!"
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"I purchased the Audio Technica AT-LP2D LP to Digital Recording System four months ago. On numerous occasions I have tried to convert many different LPs to Digital. I carefully followed all instructions and have a brand new state of the art Desktop Computer (Windows XP). Unfortunately, I have been unable to convert anything. Therefore, I suggest anyone interest in this product - Don't Waste Your Money. The promise sounds great but the product does not deliver."
1,"This is for Amazon, not the turntable","Add me to the list of those promised this turntable only to find out after not bidding on several other turntables on eBay that it's not available from Amazon anymore. I'm a big fan of Amazon and buy frequently from this site so this is a major disappointment, not just because I didn't get my turntable but that Amazon did this to so many people."
1,Another sad story........:-(,"Yes, it was my Christmas present too. I ordered it in late Nov. with promised delivery by 12/14. I also recieved the dreaded email telling me that them could not honor their commitment. Now that we have all been put on hold and on the search, the question is; is there a better product out there? What about the Ion unit? any comments? Let's use Amazon for a open forum!Happy New Year and Prosperous ""Tech"" Shopping"
3,I can't figure out the software!,"The sound is okay but I am not computer savy and can't figure out first, how to make the saved file into a mp3 format. Second, if I record one track and stop the recording to put another record on to continue, it won't let me because the original ""file"" I created is gone. How does one stop and start again? Three stars because I know this is all my fault but the point is the instructions should be easier and more complete if indeed it is titled a ""Cakewalk"" software."
3,AT-LP2DLP=ATPL50 W/Software,"I'll give myself credit for not fully reading the lack of compatability with a Mac.When I received the unit (AT-LP2DLP) I didn't realize that it was simply the ATPL-50 with PC software. When I tried to explain this to the foreign service rep @ Amazon she sent me another of the same. This was after telling her I didn't want it. Anyhow, with the discount and free shipping I kept it. After purchasing an i-MIC from the Apple retail store,(with free downloadable software) I got it to work. The turntable is cheesy but it performs adequately. For the price I'd recommend it."
5,Very Pleased,"Bought as a present for my son, a 17 year old drummer. He LOVES them! He's been playing for about 7 years and has gotten quite good. Great for punk/hard/alternative rock. Whereas I am not the musician, other drummers that he has shown them to have had nothing but positive things to say. To me, that says it all!"
5,great pedal,"Upgraded from a Vex double bass pedal and the difference is night and day. So far I've played with the blue and black cam, but have settled on the black as it feels more natural. I'm a beginner as far as my level of play goes, but this pedal definitely has helped my progression with double bass."
2,money wasted,"Silvana's voice is beautiful, but the CD have only 3 great songs that were hits: Me muero por estar contigo; Palabras, palabras & Locuras tengo de ti. The rest of the songs are garbage. Don't waste your money on this terrible CD. If you like those hits, download them from an approved site and save your money."
3,"Great for publishers, but...","When I received my book contract, my publisher recommended this book, and I hurried out to the library to pick up a copy -- but I found that it wasn't exactly what I was looking for. If you're starting a publishing house of your own, this is an excellent resource, but it's not ideal for authors. I flipped through chapters full of information that didn't apply to me -- and I often felt that authors were an afterthought, spoken to only in the occasional box at the end of a section. I did get a few good ideas from this book, however, and if you're preparing to promote a book of your own, pick it up from the library and page through it. For authors, I recommend Publicize Your Book! by Jacqueline Deval -- it will give you more of what you need."
1,Never Got It,"I would have loved giving you a positive review, however, I can't review something I've not received. This product was ordered and paid for a while ago and should not have taken this long to ship. My review can only be that of disappointment and my gratefulness that I didn't lose too much money on the product. This makes me very untrustworthy of your sales.Regretfully,Carol Steeger"
5,Enrico Moretto's review of -Topics in Management Science-,"While a student I really liked this book. Now that I am a teacher I still use it to prepare my courses in operations research. It's well written, clear and full of carefully explained examples. And even if english is not my native language I had (and still have!) no problem in understanding it. I strongly recommend it for undergraduate courses in management science."
2,Not what I expected,I bought this CD for one song and regretted it after receiving and listening to the other tracks. The Black Betty track is awesome and I was hoping for the rest of the CD to be of the same style. No dice; it seems the band is more into techno for teens rather than some good remakes of classic rock songs.
5,I'm obviously confused,"I thought these reviews were intended to grade an album. The only other review here is, admittedly by reviewer, for one song only.I have had this album for many years and have listened to it over and over again. It is a wonderful album. Every song is sung to perfection by Johnny Mathis. I don't believe he can sing a wrong note. And here in 2007 (almost 2008) he's still at it; for more than 50 years. The band backing him is absolutely wonderful as well. (I can't remember who right now, I'd have to dig out my album. I have it on my computer). They complement each other very well.Go Johnny. You are Mr. Wonderful. And you have a great big heart."
5,Great CD,This CD is very inspiring and very well done. I had it before on cassette tape but my new car has a CD player not tape. I tried to find the CD locally but they didn't have it at the Christen Book Store. Get ut while you can.
2,DARN!,"THIS WAS A REALLY NICE LOOKING SHOE, BUT WAS TOO NARROW FOR ME. I HAVE A NARROW FOOT, AND USUALLY THE OPPOSITE OCCURS, SO I WAS REALLY DISAPPOINTED, BUT HAD TO RETURN IT!"
1,5 stars? Really?,"First, there was just one as opposed to the 2 in the picture. Aside from that I thought the material was horrible quality. Rough. Thin. Think worse than Wal-Mart brand. Something I wouldn't sleep on much less put my baby on. Soooo . . . I bought some nice king size pillow cases and will be sewing them down to size. Wish I hadn't wasted the money."
2,The one I got is 65% polyester,"I hate to be the only negative review, but I paid more for this sheet than the other two packs available on Amazon because I wanted 100% cotton. I'm not sure if they sent the wrong sheet in error, but the one I received is a stiff 65% poly/35% cotton blend. I will be returning it."
4,Good Read for the Novice Trader,This book is a reality sandwich on what you will be facing in the trading world and how to best be prepared mentally. It does get a bit long winded at times but it's an easy read.A must for the beginner.
3,So what's new?,"Taken in a vacuum, the book contains useful information, especially for the beginner; but in the light of all the trading books out on the market today, there's nothing particularly new here: Control your emotions, and find a trading style suited to your personality.One aspect of the book that I found annoying was the ""Anthony Robbins"" influence throughout most of the book (since most of the book concentrates on the psychological aspects of trading). Not that I necessarily disagree with Anthony Robbins -- but at this point, it's so.. TRITE.Ho hum.."
4,the life of a rebel,"A well written book about a legendary man. The reader gets to see the truth about one of the greatest men of this century. He symbolized the need for social change in all of Latin America. He didn't do this for personal greatness, he did it to make lives better for the people of the region. In this book we can see what a complex man he really was. At times cruel, hard driving, at others kind and compassionate. Anderson does a great job weaving together all the facts and tales of Che and gives the reader the full insight of his life in this book. This book is good for anyone interested in Che Guevara, and will lead the reader to want to read more about Che and also read his works. Hasta La Victoria Siempre"
5,A very long book,I just started reading this book and already I understand Che. Anderson goes into very deep detail. All in all a very thick book.
3,More than you need to know,"This is an exhausting book! It is more than you ever wanted to know about Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara because it takes you from birth to death in this man's life. Strangely, this interminable story leaves out the most important fact about this man. Che Guevara was a psychopathic murderer who killed hundreds, likely thousands (we'll never know the exact number) of innocent people with no more conscience than if he was killing some chickens.He was also a bumbler who fumbled his way through military campaigns allowing many of his idiotic followers to be killed. A disgruntled and sick rabble-rouser who fomented discontent and created destruction wherever he went. I wonder if all the young people who proudly wear their ""Che"" T-shirts know that they are promoting a mythical figure who was one of the most murderous people of the twentieth century?"
1,An appalling whitewash of a sociopath,"This work is a piece of trash, an appalling whitewash of one of the 20th century's great, murderous sociopaths. Guevara was a cold-blooded murderer, nothing more, nothing less. He was committed only to sleeping with as many women as possible, and killing as many men and boys as possible. Next to Guevara, Charles Manson is a boy scout. That this monster, Guevara, is an icon on our college campuses today is merely indicative of the moral degeneracy of higher education. Revolting, simply revolting."
4,Excellent chronicle of Che's life,"I am half way through this book and I have to say it is amazing. It has sparked a surge of interest in me to learn even more about Che. I strongly recommend this book to anyone that wants to learn more about this amazing man's life - start with this book! The details that Anderson provides are impeccable, and truly give an honest, beautiful, and gritty account of his life. I can't wait to finish this book and read others!"
5,A complete book about the greatest man to have ever lived,"I brought this book along with me on my travels through parts of Europe, an adventure like those Che and Alberto Granado went through in South America. Before reading it I had already respected the man, but after reading it, I learned how to travel as a traveller rather than as a tourist. I felt the real character of Che, and was amazed of the things he had done,and his take on life. In fact, after reading the book I decided to get Che tatooed on my arm. It is really a great book, and whatever you know about Che, wether you feel he was good or bad, read the book to find out the truth for yourself.What was interesting was that on the plane I was reading the book and the man sitting next to me was Bolivian, and told me his father was one of the generals responsible for killing Che!!"
1,Another Romanticized Fictionalized version of Ernresto Guevara,"Are you kidding me? He was a failed human being, a trigger happy opportunisit who took advantage of Cuba and Cubans for his own personal profit. In today's Cuba, the elite are the Castros and descendants of Guevara. This is Che's/ Castro's legacy. Not the romanticized fiction that sells books."
5,anm amazing piece of work - masterpiece,"I wondered why there were so few biographies of Che, and after reading Anderson's masterpiece I understood why - a hard act to follow!. There is not much more to say. If you want to understand Che, this is the book. Extremely well researched and in many ways not much has changed. It seems his revolutionary life was instigated by the US exploitation of Latin America and a determination to unshackle countries from what he saw as American imperialism."
4,Journey with Che through his life,"I started this book on a Sunday morning and was so enthralled, so enraptured in the story, in the author's telling of the story, in the life of this incredible man, that i could not sleep that night and finished the book on Monday. The book is very impressionant, presenting a journey throught the life of Che, inviting the reader to journey next to this man. I was slightly suprised at the amount of background info, exterior to Che's life, but I guess that was necessary to set the story, so to say, so that the reader unfamiliar with the historical events could gain a better understanding of the influences on Che."
4,Che Kindle Edition,"I've read about 75% of the paperback edition about seven years ago. But I couldn't get through it. However, as with other books, I was able to complete the Kindle edition in a couple of weeks.The Kindle edition is an updated/revised addition. It's very well written, completely readable.At times difficult to keep track of some of the characters, and (in my opinion) it gets a little slow when the author writes about the exploits of other revolutionaries in Argentina or Africa. Also, I was hoping that there would be a happy ending, whereas Che escapes and lives to old age like his partner, Fidel. But, of course, we all know what happens.At any rate, I really liked the book. Even if you know everything there is to know about Che, it's still worth reading."
3,Requires active reading to sift through the bias,"Diving into this book I knew relatively little about Che. Finishing this book I have a working knowledge of the chronology of his ultimately wasted and murderous life. What was telling to me is that in spite of the very obvious bias in support of Che's many indefensible actions, at the end of his life there was absolutely NOTHING positive that this megalomaniacal sociopath contributed to society. If you can maintain your attention with vigilance to copiously read between the lines and mark the importance of details NOT included or actions NOT expounded on than perhaps a person completely ignorant of the chronology of his existence will find some value in this book. I certainly did."
5,why collegiate idealism is best grown out of during college,"i thought this was a very objective, balanced and well researched biography. i've given this to a rabidly right-wing cuban friend of mine. i'm dying to see what he thinks.after reading the book i came to see che as an immature egomaniac with artificially enhanced (asthma) will power and drive. politically, he seems very much a product of the u.s. banana republic policies coupled with youthful idealism. if only we'd been a little less heavy handed in guatemala, but i guess we're almost always a little heavy handed."
2,Disturbing Propaganda,This is the most disturbing piece of propaganda biography I have ever read concerning the radical left elements in world society. The whole book by Anderson is written as an adoring look at one of the world's most aspiring murderers who is idolized by much of the world who know nothing more about him than as a quaint screen print for a T-Shirt. This book helps bolster this blind loyalty to the human epitomy of evi.
5,This book...,"Should be a required read in high school so that all of those kids who are waddling about in the Che t-shirts and the like, know what it is they are celebrating. It's a wonderful recount of a wonderful idea that went terribly wrong. I LOVE this book. I have read it three times now and just got the digital edition."
4,"Complete and correct, but not the best choice","Here in Brazil, this book was translated as ""Che - a Vida em vermelho"".In English, this means:""Che, a red life"".Yes, this book is complete and correct, but the book ""Ernesto Che Guevara: Mito y Realidad"" (Spanish Edition) by Enrique Ros is a better and a little smaller, choice to buy."
4,ok but not good enough,"Language was not particulary literate, but everyone should know about life of Che and this book gives a pretty good picture of that. I recommend highly this book.. Kaikkien suomalaisten pitäis varsinkin lukea tämä kirja, ja ottaa opiksi että joskus jotain voi saada aikaan tekemällä jotain, eikä ainaa vaan valittamalla."
1,"A rambling, fawning hagiography","I was looking forward to reading this book. Instead, completing this book became an arduous task. In summary, it was a fawning, rambling 700+ pages of biased writing, much of it given in excruciating, unnecessary detail."
1,Hollywood Che,"The glitterati and hipster intellectuals are often quoted saying things like 'Che Guevara was such a complex individual you couldn't grasp his brilliance in a lifetime.' I think there is no historic figure that has been more often compared to Jesus Christ -- and it's a sure bet that every last one is an athiests, and Marxist, too.That said, do yourself a favour and read Fontova's ""Exposing the Real Che Guevara."" Fontova managed to capture the deepest, richest nuances of Che's true character in an economical 200 pages."
2,Commies Aren't Cool,"The recent rise in popularity of Che among urban youth inspired me to do a little research on the man. I learned that he didn't think prisoners had the right to a fair trial and he would order their execution (and you though Abu Grahb was bad!). He did say he wanted to save the world's poor, but don't all commies say that? Stalin, Lenin, and Pol Pot promised great things too! Just look at Cuba and ask yourself if the one success Che had can really be called a success? The main had good intentions, but terrible means. He was a terrorist that thought just because he wanted to help the poor he could kill whomever and cause chaos. Bin Laden probably sports a Che shirt. Che tried to toppled dictators, but he wanted to replace it with Communism. After seeing 85 to 100 million people die as a result of Communism, why do people still like Che? Why don't they just wear Stalin or Pol Pot t-shirts?"
1,Jon Lee Anderson is a dope!,"For a real picture of what Che Guevara was really like (a thug, a pathological murderer, an incompetent guerrilla fighter, a loser, a liar and a coward) read the book by Humberto Fontova ""Exposing the real Che Guevara and the useful idiots who idolize him.""Exposing the Real Che Guevara: And the Useful Idiots Who Idolize HimFidel: Hollywood's Favorite TyrantShadow Warrior/the CIA Hero of a Hundred Unknown Battles"
1,Very funny! Boring Cliche.HORRIBLY BIASED DESPITE AUTHORS ASSERTIONS,"Very funny, this is coming from the man who said to Felix Rodriguez: "" I am worth more alive than Dead to you!"" If you want to know who this coward bubbling sociopath idiot was just reading Exposing Che, and Un Mito O Realidad and Shadow warrior. All these other books come straight from the Source: His family or extremely biased admirers. He was so good at warfare that he got killed because he couldn't even lead bolivian campesinos who were on the left. the irony is he became what he hated most: A capitalist Icon."
5,"CHE,THE MAN WHO WON THE HEART OF THE WORLD.","I know Cuba very well, I have been a lot of times there talking with the cuban people about CHE,I feel the CHE like a cuban but I learn the CHE feelings reading this book.My eyes were open every day eating the life of Guevara and all the situations of Cuba revolution, I ""was with him"" living into the paper of this great compilation. You must be there also and say HASTA LA VICTORIA SIEMPRE."
3,Great for a classroom study but not for....,"This book is so full of information it begins to sound more like a step by step account of Che's life. I was sincerely looking forward to reading interesting and historical facts but there are more long winded historical segues and side stories narrated in the third person than one would expect from a biographical book. One example relates to an account of Che's purchase of a gift for a friend which spans 2 pages--was this a major event by normal standards: probably not. At times I felt as if I was reading the report of someone who had too much information but did not want to truncate it under the belief that it would seem dishonest.However, if you dont mind reading minute details about someone as interesting as Che, then you should buy this book. If you are more interested in getting to the heart of his ideology and political inclinations, look elsewhere."
1,"How about ""Che: The truth about him","Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life"" How many more of these tomes glorifying this mass-murderer do we need? Inspiring? Inspiring to do what? Terrorize and kill people? Cringe? This monster was the coldblooded murderer of thousands of innocent Cubans. How he was finally captured and cowered, ""Don't kill me, I'm Che. I'm worth more to you alive than dead."" So no one has written a ""definitive"" biography of this monster? Try reading ""Exposing the Real Che Guevara: And the Useful Idiots Who Idolize Him"" by Humberto Fontova (Aug 26, 2008)"
5,Excellent.,"Extraordinary account of the life of one of the most -if not the most- fascinating historical figures of our time, one of the few that will probably live more than a thousand years, as having achieved the status of mith. Lee Anderson stops at every detail, searches in sources that had been closed until now and gives us hints of the multifacetic personality of the young, the revolutionary, the visionary and the man.If something wrong it is the excesive amount of information on the revolutionary Cuba period, because sometimes the narration distances itself from the central actor. Also keep away those who look for the mythical Che and those who would want to find a devil in him (after all a commie!), because this is a rigourous book. The definitive biographie of Ernesto Guevara, sometimes known as Che."
4,Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life by Jon Lee Anderson,"Never boring, this tome written about the life of Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara seems to say it all. Mr. Anderson spent several years researching his subject and as a result offers one of the most in-depth works that this reader has yet to find (and I've found many). Aleida March, Che's second wife, collaborated with Mr. Anderson giving him access to information about Che and also to some of his writings, allowing us an even deeper glimpse into the hero. No Guevara fan should ignore this book."
5,You won't be disappointed,"After hearing Rothman on NPR's Marketplace I wanted to read more and was not disappointed. ""50 Companies"" is positioned as a kind of encyclopedic guide to the top businesses of our time, and it certainly is that. But even more so, I believe, it's about the reciprocal relationships between all of business and all of society and individual businesses with each other. And in this it succeeds even more. Rothman mentions in the beginning how many of these companies touched his life as he was writing the book, and I found even more connections with my own life."
2,Not very enlighting,"Book is well written but some profiles lacks insight. In many cases historical info is really shallow, you get only dates and facts and no explanation why and how something was achieved, ie. profiles of Coca Cola and General Motors. Slightly better are biographies of IT companies, but sometimes they're drowning in the tangle of details. When I read profile of Apple I got impression that it's more about company failures and weaknesses than about what they really brought into the world. If they were and still are so bad then why to give them no.4 on this (artificial) list ?"
2,Missing pages,The book itself is great but I was missing pages from 52 to 87. I am not sure if the book is printed that way or of my book was the exception. Just make sure when you first get the book to check for missing pages.
3,Good Saturday morning movie!,"This movie wasn't much for drama and cinematography, but it did move right along with action and some suspense, and a couple of great twists! Forgettable, but fun while I was watching it! Better a $1.99 movie!"
2,I shouldn't have seen it at the theater,The previews to this movie made it seem awesome...unfortunately it was boring. I don't think it's worth paying $3.99 to watch it online but definetly for a $1.20 from Redbox if there's nothing else.
1,Are they THAT desperate?,I could not believe that 2 major actors of their caliber were in this B-rated at best movie! The story line sucked and had parts that were not probable. I was aggravated and disappointed that I spent money to even rent this because I expected so much more!
1,where's the action??,"I thought since this was advertised as an ""action"" movie that there would be some actual action and suspense. But, no. It was LAME and I DO NOT recommend watching it.waste of time."
2,Too much language,I enjoy watching Mark Wahlberg but was disappointed at the amount of foul language.I can deal with some but it was way over the top and I just don't care to listen to it.
2,Lame And Predictable,"While I'm a fan of Mark Whalberg's it's obvious that this film was a pay day. I didn't turn it off, however the film was predictable and half assed. the typical, ""I was the best at what I did but now I'm retired and now someone in my familie's in trouble so I have to get back into the game for one last job,"" deal. And of course one of his best friends has set him up. As always, Giovanni Robisi is awesome, however even he can't really save the film. The actors themselves aren't the problem as much as this is obviously just a paycheck for Whalberg and everyone else is there to say they were along for the ride."
2,Not Original Very Predictable,"This movie is a remake of many. Nothing is original, everything is predictable. This will be on Netflix....no Channel 6 Sunday Night movie in no time. Save your money because this film should be declared ""contraband""."
2,Missing Something,"This movie doesn't know what it is. There's funny situations but its not funny not even in a clever way. There's action but it's more bad boys 2 than Mr. and Mrs. Smith. There was dynamic plot twists, however it was more ridiculous than italian job but with none of the background and character development that makes it fun or suspenseful.This movie has smuggling, Drugs, fights, a high end art heist, good actors, a hot chick (they made ugly?!), decent budget and camera effects, all things I love and anticipated and its still falls on its face. It must have been a combination of written, produced, and directed by too many people that didn't get along.Everyone on set had uncontrollable attention spans. Fell short of usable material so only able so they brainstormed and added in what everyone wanted to fill that extra 45 minutes that should have never made it past editing. If there is a directors cut I hope its nothing like what I saw in theaters."
2,Entirely and completely forgettable,"All performances are phoned in. The cast is good, but everything about the script and direction is derivative and bland. This is a textbook example of a rehashed, unmemorable film. You've seen everything in it five times already. Imagine a TV heist drama. Now imagine another TV heist drama that uses the first as a model. That's what you have.Also, the evil character's motivations are very obscure. It's never really clear why anybody does anything. This movie makes a Statham movie look like Blade Runner."
5,Great movie,"I enjoy the fact that I can download tv shows, and movies. It's relaxing when on a long ride to be able to view a tv show or movie."
3,Better than I expected,"I caught this on cable last night and I'm puzzled by the poor notices. While it doesn't have the moodiness or verve of a truly great thriller, it is mostly a solid piece of work with some intriguing twists and good insider details on smuggling. Like ""Lord of War"" (which overlaps with this film in interesting ways) some people just seem to have a problem with the lead actor. I found it diverting and entertaining while it was on. The modern-art joke at the end was a nice surprise."
2,ehhhh no interest,First off I LOVE Markie Mark !!! He is a great actor but this one just did not do it for me and did not keep me engaged to sit through it :-(
5,Mark Wahlberg is always good!,Lots of action and very good acting. Mark Wahlberg rarely disappoints and he held our interest throughout the movie. The story was interesting and all of the actors did fine jobs.
2,"Rent, don't buy","Wanted to buy this movie when it first came out, decided to go the rent option instead to check it out. The movie plot is real slow and will find yourself wanting to fast forward through the movie. Could've been a lot better and was disappointed with how it all turned out."
2,Disappointed,Anazon always puts me in touch w/ new movies and books. I was disappointed in this movie and the mundane story line. Mark Wahlburg is so much better than this Grade B presentation of the underworld of drugs and crime. The excitment never happens and no intrigue in this plot. Hoping for a better selection next time.
2,Potential but doesnt deliver,"This movie couldnt decide if it wanted to be a slick heist movie or a gritty drug trafficing film. It balances itself between the 2 for much of the movie. There are a few points that seem to give rise to brilliance, but most of those are quickly tossed under the rug by standard cliches of drug, police and action movies.This movie offers nothing that you haven't seen before. Its a fine action flick to watch if you want to pass the time for a $1 redbox rental, but purchasing should be kept to marky mark fans exclusivley."
1,Ugly Mess,"Movies like this are ugly and not entertaining. In the 1940s, noir movies had a manner to separate the good/bad guys from the bad/bad guys, and keep us from leaving. For example, in 1947s Kiss of Death, Victor Mature is a crook who eventually goes good, while Richard Widmark, as the notorious Tommy Udo, was not only bad, but probably created a role that dogged him his entire career. (Just check out how Tommy Udo deals with ""Rat fink"" grandmothers in wheelchairs.) In Contraband, a vile drama, much like The Departed, Man on Fire, and 52 Pickup, we must endure enormous cruelty and gratuitous violence merely for the sake of a self-indulgent director and badly written script. The stories are not made more clear, the characters more understandable, the dramatic resolution at least satisfying. Instead, Thank God, that's over! A real waste of talent and money."
2,Low Quality,"For a fairly good cast of actors, this should have been a good movie. It was low budget, poor story line, and mostly disappointing."
4,A good action film.,"A former drug runner gone straight gets back in the game in order to bail out his screw-up brother-in-law. He is known as one of the best, and must try to outsmart authorities, while also worrying about the safety of his wife and children. This is a solid action-adventure film that will appeal primarily to a male audience, with its tough-guy sequences and non-stop action, but is not merely a mindless, violent male action fantasy. It has a heady plot, and there is a surprise twist at the end. Contraband is a straightforward action film that most moviegoers should enjoy."
2,Not one of Mark Wahlberg's better movies,Watch Shooter instead. It has a better plot line and story. This story line dragged out and became too predictable.
5,Wahlberg!!!!,Mark Wahlberg can do no wrong this man has never made a bad movie form Perfect Storm to Four brothers to Shooter to Ted!!!! This Guy Can do It all great Action Packed Movie!!!!
4,Contraband,"Good movie, lots of action, even though it is not a family movie. Wish they had left out bad language."
4,Cool typical Mark Wahlberg film,If you like his type of movies then you will love this film. Lots of action but the ending was a little dissapointing but still very cool. Defilinetly suggest this movie
3,Wahlberg is a master of action,"Mark Wahlberg is the go-to guy for action films. He's a killer, a super star. And he's in his usual role as guy who has to save someone. This time he has to save his brother, who's gotten into trouble because he blew a smuggling job. Now Wahlberg has to take on a larger smuggling job, which he swore he would never do again, to save his brother.Wait, does that sound familiar? It's pretty much the story of Gone in 60 Seconds, but with a better lead actor and part of the story is set in South America. (It even has Giovanni Ribisi!!)The reason I don't rate this movie higher is that the plot is lacking a little bit and there is an extraordinary amount of gruesome violence. Don't get me wrong, I love action movies but there are a few times that I had to look away! Overall though, it was a fun movie, you can't look away, and the ending is great."
3,Contraband,Good movie but pretty much just average. Trailor made it seem as a great action packed movie but it did not live up to the hype for me.
3,Movie was ok,"Movie is okay. To pass the time if your board it is worth watching. I'm glad I did not pay to see it at theaters, I would give it a solid C grade."
4,"Blu-ray Review: ""Contraband""","So many different crime capers come out every month in theaters and on DVD that it's sometimes hard to decide which ones to watch and which ones to avoid. I'm not over saturated by the genre so I enjoy most of the ones I see. ""Contraband"" is now on my list of films I'd recommend.The Blu-ray release of ""Contraband"" will satisfy movie lovers with the amount of special features and a quality feature that will entertain viewers. There's a lot of pervasive language, a good amount of violence, and some drug use in this. However, it's no more than what fans of these types of crime thrillers are already used to."
4,Loved it,I love Mark W - he has been great in all the movies I have seen with him in it. I loved the action and non stop twists and turns in this movie. I would recommend it if you love spy thriller type of movies.
1,Unrealistic,"Pure fantasy. The plot is contrived and unrealistic, the action scenes are bogus, and overall, you cannot get to the suspension of disbelief. walburg's worse movie."
2,what a mess,"Bad acting, over acting, and a badly written script! Unless you are a big fan of Mark Wahlberg, you will be disappointed with this movie. (Even being a fan, you might be disappointed.) The ending was not too bad. I just loved that the captain of the cargo ship is out to sea and is in his ""dress"" uniform the entire time! On a cargo ship?? The captain of the Love Boat even wore a casual uniform."
2,based upon a film shot in reykjavik...unfortunately it survived,"it has been stated that wahlberg sleep walked his way through this farm report of a movie...i skipped the walking and just slept through it...for those determined to endure to the ending, don't bother...that also is absolutely predictable...ciao."
2,Contraband,"This movie is cheezy and fake, definately not worth buying, the plot doesn't flow together well and the movie comes across really unrealistic. Fear was one of Mark Whalbergs better movies."
2,Formulaic and uninteresting,"I was excited to watch Contraband because of the unique subject matter, but the plot wasn't very twisty or unique, and there were few surprises. Felt like a long TV episode rather than a taut thriller."
2,Disappointed!,"I am one of those people who feel like Mark Whalberg made a great transition from raping/modeling and has become one of the most entertaining actors we have to date however; this movie was horrible at least for me. This movie was predictable, slow, boring i just saw this whole scene before and i am so glad i did not pay to see this in the movie theater as a person who hate's going to the dentist i would rather be in the dentist chair than to sit through this."
1,"Movie 3, blu ray production ZERO","The movie itself is (arguably) fine; the main problem with this product is the blu ray formatting itself. If you pause the movie long enough for it to go the ""Universal"" screen, it will never start again. It freezes at the point of resumption, and will not play. Similarly, if you eject the movie, re-insert, and try to select the scene you were watching, it freezes on that scene and will not play.I fail to see how the Blu-Ray industry can keep shoving the ""Blu Ray is so awesome"" speech down our throats, when I have YET to see a single blu ray that will play from start to finish without pausing for several seconds at some point in the middle of the movie to ""catch up with itself"". DVD never did that. And DVD on a blu ray player looks great! All the industry needed to do was make a better dvd player, not an inferior new movie format.This blu ray needs to be recalled until the formatting bugs are worked out!"
2,Bad movie,"The storyline was a great idea but the execution was terrible. This totally bored me to death. I usually like Mark Wahlberg movies, but even this one, he couldn't make it good. I just sat there wishing it would just end already. He basically did drug carrying before, but went straight afterwards.Now, he needs to do one more job or his family will die. Pretty basic. He manage to do it, of course. Then, it all worked out at the end. Nothing too great worth mentioning happened in the movie.No one should but this movie, and even renting would be a bad idea. Nothing worth wild to see at all. Maybe it was just the trailer that got everyone excited about this one, but the actual movie fails to deliver."
2,Not worth it,"I see a few reviews here mentioning alot of action, and excitement. I wonder if i saw a different film. As a fan of Mark's i wanted to like this movie, but it was tepid at best, it kept building up and failed to deliver, and it had me and my date yawning by the end (she is a die hard Mark fan, and we went to see this because she swoons over him)I would catch it at redbox, and not waste adding it to my collection."
2,Lame!,"Don't get sucked in by the trailer. This movie never entered the realm of possibility, which I can live with, but the movie did nothing to generate any interest in the outcome for the characters. My greatest concern was the fact that I lost that time forever and can't get it back. Don't let this happen to you!"
1,Read The One Star Reviews First,"What a convoluted (plot) waste of time. Although Mark Wahlberg plays what he plays best: A low IQ blue-collar worker/thief, it still does not save this mediocre action doper film from the waste can. And poor (blond, tattooed -- WTF!)Kate Beckinsale has absolutely nothing to do in this film other than to say stupid wifey dialog. Any C-rated actress could have filled this role (e.g. Lindsey Lohan stoned). As they say, Kate couldn't resist a payday for 6 days of work, so she took the money and ran. Even the bad guys in this film are pathetic, non-menacing.Mark has to stop thinking he's a great producer, actor, and judge of scripts, and fire his agent & manager, and return to being a simpleton sidekick of real A-list actors (e.g. George Clooney in Three Kings). Dumb, dumb, dumb movie. Don't buy, don't rent. Watch on HBO for 15 min. and then take your wife out to dinner. Now you are guaranteed a happy ending."
2,not good,"I was impressed by Waglberg's previous movies like shooter, fighter etcBut this one is poor story line, unwanted drama, total time waste , bad buy for me.2 * just for his acting."
1,too many F-words,"I counted one f-word in every sentence in the first five minutes. Come on! That's a little ridiculous! Mark, you're better than that."
3,Just soso,"Considering good old markie mark is in this, you'd think it would be a good film. ive never seen a bad movie by the guy. Oh wait, I just did."
5,Great Movie,"Action packed. Mark is a great actor. Definitely a must see. I would have liked to see Kate Beckinsale with more of a substantial part, but all in all it's still a great movie."
5,Rented on Amazon Prime - Streamed to my Set...Awesome.,Amazon has a wealth of online content and I love being able to rent online and stream instantly. The movie experience was great and I would rent again in this way. As for the movie itself. It was good. If you are a fan of Mark Wahlberg (aka Marky Mark without the funky bunch) then you'll like this movie. Kate Beckensale does a great job as well and despite her affinity for using the F-word (which sounds so sweet coming from her british lips) is adorable in this movie. Its an action movie with some drama - what's more to say? It didn't suck and I thought it was worth the watch.
4,get the popcorn ready,"Pretty good action scenes, but more important, it had a story line which was pretty plausible. Have to be careful about the sound level. Some of the scenes get really loud. Good story line."
2,Violently forgettable,"Weak acting, weak script, weak plot, seen it all before, and done far far better.Plus, the mindless killing of all those guys during the heist kind of makes the celebration at the end rather sick. So it's fine if dozens of people die so a few crooks can get rich? Nice. Marky Mark needs to stick with his fawning talentless entourage and leave the dime store philosophy to someone who actually cares about more than just WINNING! Charlie Sheen would have fit in well here, actually.Not worth your time. Well, mine at least."
4,"Good movie, check it out",I was worried it wasn't going to be that great of a movie after reading the reviews. It was a lot better than I thought it was going to be. It was a good movie....check it out
3,would have given 3.5 stars if available,"This movie was completely enjoyable, even though I usually avoid drugs/thieves/cops movies. C'mon, Mark Walberg and Kate Beckinsale. How could you go wrong?"
4,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078,"Mark Wahlberg is certainly no genius, but when it comes to action movies, he's on top of his game. I wish I could say Contraband was an amazing film, but it was your typical, shoot 'em up action thriller, although the plot was better than most. A lot of critics bashed this film because of its predictability, but what do you expect from these types of films? The story, about an ex-smuggler, returning to his old ways to pay off an unexpected debt, was easy to follow and full of cool action sequences. That's really all you can ask for from these films and I rather enjoyed it. If you don't like action movies, don't watch them! If you do like them, Contraband is a pretty good one and few action stars bring to the table the experience that Whalberg has. If you're looking for something that you don't really have to think about, that will hold your attention, and kill a couple of hours, go with Contraband."
3,Not as good as I thought.,I was surprised. It was not as good a movie as I thought it would be. The action and the storyline did not really match.
1,Worst,"I'm a big fan, but this is Mark Wahlberg's worst movie that I've seen.The foul language is just absolutely unnecessary. I think they were getting paid by how many “f” bombs they could utter per scene. And the plot was a little thin too. Just hated it, no redeeming points I can make about it"
3,"Not bad, worth a rental","To echo the words of another reviewer, if you are a Wahlberg fan and enjoy the heist genre, this movie is passably viewable. I might be a bit more critical if I had shelled out some serious coin and watched this in the theater, but as a rental I don't regret the $4.99. Wahlberg is his usual frowny, muscley self, not much change here- but this is how I like my Wahlberg, full of quiet angst and muted emotions (sans rage of course). Beckinsale's performance was pretty vanilla, enough so that I forgot that it was her until I came back to write this.In sum, it is worth a rental if you like this kind of genre."
4,My Kind Of Movie,I have always enjoyed Wallberg's movies. They are all pretty much the same. I find them to be enjoyable entertainment. I never look for anything too deep in them. I never fall asleep or turn them off.
4,Pretty good,This movie was action packed from the beginning until the end. It will really keep your attention. I watched it on a short plane ride and the time flew by.
2,snorrrrrrrrreeeeeeeee,The plot barely moved along. After being very excited for this movie I ended up falling asleep before the end.
3,Mark Wahlberg Action Movies,"Typical Mark Wahlberg action movie. Lots of guns and shooting. Fun car chases and close calls. If you liked ""Shooter"" you will like this action adventure flick as well."
3,"wished for more ""thriller""","Was expecting a bit more excitement in this movie, a la The Fast and The Furious, but nada. It's a decent movie to pass the time, but don't expect too much."
1,another with lots of talent...,"but awful. Logic be damned. Get drunk or drugged, because then it might make sense to you. Otherwise, abandon hope. It could be a primer on what not to do. Go to Panama, while there have meetings, buy fake money, rob armored truck, escape police, drive thru congested city, all in one hour. On what planet?"
1,overdone,"Poor character development, unrealistic, and overdone plot. A waste of time. The preview did not reflect the reality of the movie....misleading."
3,"Excellent Premise And Good Acting Makes For A Great Steak. However, It Is Undercooked In...","Note: I saw this movie with XFinity On Demand.This film has an excellent premise and good acting from everyone, particularly Mark Wahlberg & a sorely underused Kate Beckinsale. An excellent premise and good acting are two key ingredients for a great steak, movie-wise. However, this one is undercooked in the relationship area between Kate and her little brother. I never got the impression that she loved him, apart from one line early in the film. And why do writers feel that it's okay to combine God's Name with a mild curse word, thereby turning it into a strong profanity? That's also another reason I gave this film 3 stars instead of 5.Rated R (strong language & violence and brief drug use)."
3,If you're a Wahlberg fan it's worth renting,"Not Wahlberg's best movie but certainly worth renting. It does relive the movie heist genre, and there are a couple of scenes that are over the top but knowing that it's still worth renting..."
1,Boring,Boring. I like Wahlberg - decent acting but this storyline was farfetched and extremely unrealistic... Wait till it streams for free on netflix.
3,Love Mark as a actor,I have not seen this movie as of yet and am waiting for it to arrive. Mark is a great actor and I can't wait.
2,"boring, predictable movie.","boring, predictable movie. I do not even remember what it is about, and I saw it within the past couple of months. Can't they even try for some originality?"
3,Not the best movie,I just didn't like the movie. It was seriously lacking in all aspects of the plot. I knew what was going to happen in the first couple minutes.
5,This is THE BEST,"I have used several input devices with Flight Simulator and this is the only joystick that I would even think about using. It certainly adds a good sense of feel that is required in today's games--just like power steering is commonplace on cars. The customizable buttons and the device profiler allows you to be more flexible when setting the buttons--you can set joystick buttons with the profiler that you could not set otherwise! Excellent device drivers, and I would rate this a MUST for any game that can even handle a joystick."
5,An absolute necessity,"If you want to add more action into your games, this joystick will certainly wake up your senses and you'll enjoy your game to the full extent. It'll produce uncanny realism of multiple simulations ranging from engine idling to cannon blast so true, you'll never go back to any other ""dead"" joysticks. It is a must for the flight simulators and other force feedback supported games. It is worth every dollar you spend and I'm not surprised it's a #1 selling force feedback joystick."
3,Beware if you have the trident chipset!,"The trident chipset in SIIG soundcards is not compatable with joysticks that cannot be switched into analog mode. Also, a cord that splits MIDI and and joystick functions like you get with your keyboard will render the force feedback inoperable. The stick must be connected directly to the port.Force feedback does not add much to Flight simulator. If you like to keep your MIDI keyboard connected, and you do not play combat games, choose the regular sidewinder."
2,The IBC more than just another building code,"The IBC is the long-time-coming consolidation of the three major building codes in the US and there is nothing ""international"" about it. Back in the 70's the 3 code organizations formed BOCA and put out a 1 & 2 family dwelling code. The 3 members them gradually made changes to the individual building codes that brought them into similar formats, then they combined them into one code in 2000, the IBC, and modified the dwelling code to be the IRC (Int. Residential Code)and changed the organization's name to the ICC, the Int. Code Council. There little to review about the content since it is either the law in your area or it is not. For comparisons to previous codes and other information try the ICC's website http://www.iccsafe.org/"
4,A Strucural Engineer's Necessity,It is pretty difficult to review a specification that you must have.
4,Comparing Fact and Folklore,"Many books have been written about Belle Starr, and Glenn Shirley's is the only one that reveals the known facts and leaves the rest to folklore. Living in Fort Smith, part of Belle's old stomping grounds, I've met many people who to this day still proclaim to know who Pearl Starr's father was, and at last who killed Belle Starr. Unless the bodies of Cole and Belle and Pearl and Jim Reed are dug up for DNA testing, the ""truth"" will never be known. And as for Belle's death, it will always remain one of the great mysteries of the Old West. Glenn Shirley does the best of any author in comparing fact and hearsay about this great legendary figure, and if anyone wants to read the best book on Belle Starr, this one is it. Steven Law, ReadWest.com."
4,"THE ""Chicken Raising Textbook""","We decided to raise some chickens, and I read several books on the subject in preparation. This book is by far the most complete and thorough of the books I found.Damerow covers every possible aspect of raising chickens - including recipes! This book really could be considered the ""textbook"" for chicken raising [for both small scale and large scale chicken operations].However, the book also has the ""dryness"" of a textbook. The other books I found were far more entertaining to read, but none of them were as thorough as this one.So, personally, I am glad to have this book on hand as a reference and I am sure I will refer to it many times over the years. But if you are looking for something fun to read, this isn't really it. Go buy ""Living with Chickens"" for that. :)"
2,"Information overload, not a good beginners book.","This book was way over my head. It was too detailed for me. It seems geared more towards advanced and serious chicken owners and not a good book for beginners or someone just wanting a few pet chickens. I was overwelmed with information and had a hard time picking through and finding answers to my questions. It was rather dry and read like a text book. There are also no good pictures of the various breeds and kinds of chickens. The section on choosing the perfect chicken is a table with a list of the chickens, no pictures. If you want to start your own chicken hatchery you may like this book. If you are a beginner like myself you would be better off with something else."
2,very frustrated,I was very disappointed with this book. I had two very specific questions about my laying hens since they aren't laying. I could not find information for problem solving in this area. Also I read that you should not clean the hen house floor in the winter since it helps with insulation( I read this somewhere else) . I tried to find information about this in this book but could not find anything either way.
1,Not too helpful,"Doesn't try to solve your chicken problems, just suggests culling all non-perfect chickens."
1,Didn't work for my learning style,"I have been wanting to raise chickens for a very long time. I had this book for almost two years before I actually got chickens, and having had them for a month now, I've decided to give up on this book as it has helped me very little. I would expect books like these to have a more engaged percpeption of nature.Unfortunately disappointing for me."
5,Storey's Guide to Raising Chickens: Care/Feeding/Facilities,I reviewed this book prior to purchasing for my home library. I thought that it was very informative to the beginner. She includes everything from hatching to eating in clear detail. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in raising their own chickens.
5,Great book for chicken folks,"We got this book becuase one of my 4 chickens stopped laying and was just sitting in her box, looking ill. We were panicked until the book arrived and I read about ""brooding"".We followed the book's instructions and she started laying again in 4 days!Great help!The only thing missing is an anatomy section on chickens...for us truly clueless."
4,Good information,"This isn't as compelling a read as, say, Debt of Honor or The Client, but it fills its purpose well: tells you how to raise chickens. There are a lot of gotchas that most people don't think about, and even though this book will be bought mostly by small (1 person) operations, it tells you what you need to know to grow it into a commercial deal.All in all, a well-researched and thought out book."
5,Storie's Guide to Raising Chickens,"Great Book. It covers more than enough information to start raising your own chickens, It covers a lot more than I wanted to know, when I first read it. I intend to reread it soon. Great reference book."
5,Everything you ever wanted to know about your backyard chickens,"We were very impressed with this book. Storey's book has the information you need to know about all of the ""unknown"" things about chickens. We learned many things we had no idea even existed about raising our chickens. Everyone will benefit from this well written guide to raising your chickens."
5,Excellent Introduction,"I am a born and raised city boy, and I found this book to be extremely helpful in introducing the basics of caring for chickens. There is some lack in details (slaughtering a chicken is much more difficult than a novice would expect) but 90% of the information is there, so it was worth every penny."
4,Excellent all round guide,"This is a very good book covering all aspects of chicken keeping, in detail, but retaining humour and style (which all chicken keepers have of course).It's maybe a bit oriented towards confined, rather than free range hen keeping, but I find it very helpful none the less."
3,Too conventional,"For a near-organic grower like myself, a book like Story's Guide to Raising Chickens is way too conventional. When compared to Salatin's books of pasturing poultry, this book is a waste of money. Good basic information though."
3,Informative once you've picked your breed,"*I meant to rate this book 4 stars* Very helpful book for someone wanting to sell, breed or butcher chickens. There is a lot of information on space requirements, coop design, feeding your flock, breeding and some information on diseases. There really isn't too much information on the various different breeds and only a chapter on raising baby chicks. I prefer Sue Weaver's Chicken book for information on raising baby chicks and information on the breeds. The reading in this book can get dry at times. It has little to no illustrations of any of the breeds. Overall, this is a good book and excellent for covering a little in each area of raising chickens."
4,Very nice product,"The bear is bigger than i think, and very good quality, is really soft. But i think the system needs audio, and one more thing the connection with the computer is not that easy how they say. The computer needs a special port (RCA)"
2,Not the usual page-turning stuff from Sheldon,"I was quite disappointed by this book of Sidney Sheldon. I could keep my interest till the middle of the book and after that there was no suspense left. The ending is very predictable. I have loved reading Sidney Sheldon over the years, but this was not one of his better books. However, it is clear that a lot of research has gone into this."
1,A big disappointment,I kept waiting till the last page for the unexpected ala Sheldon twist...but it never happened. A quick read but weak.
3,Very Predictable,"This was the first Sidney Sheldon book I have read. It was very predictable after the first few chapters. The first half was good, but then it got worse.`"
2,X-tremely Disappointing,"It is a pretty disappointing book by Sidney Sheldon.Where has the Author of all the great ,can't-put-it -down books been? It is going to be a long time before I'll touch another of Sheldon's book again..."
1,Extremely predictable with no depth to any of the characters,"I am fan of several authors and eagerly await their yearly publications (e.g., John Grisham, Patricia Cornwell, etc.). After this book, I am no longer waiting for any of Sidney Sheldon's ""novels"". The dialog was so ridicuously simply and undeveloped as the characters were. The entire plot could be surmised even by the most ""clueless"" of readers within the first three chapters."
1,A sad disappointed person in San Diego CA.,Sounds like a test case for a psyc. class. What a waste of time and money. Can't imagine such a talent writing a book like this. Will always check the back of his next book for Autors Notes. Just Awful!!!!!
3,His magic is gone!,"This book reminded me of ""Malice"" first. But then the story began to unfold in a different direction, so I ""had to"" go on reading it. Nevertheless, twists and turns Mr. Sheldon almost always manages to embrace to sustain the attention of his readers never came till the end. I can see he is trying to give a new facade to his book by introducing elements like multiple personality disorder (MPD) and the Internet to make it look more up-to-date. But it did not work for me. Not this time. This may simply be because I am skeptical about MPD, or the book appears to be an aggregate of randomly selected ingredients of his earlier books."
2,A DISAPPOINTING READ!!!!,"I wonder why Sheldon mentioned about the stunning climax? Is it because Sheldon thought the readers would be unable to guess who Toni and Allette really are? BLAH!!!! It is completely predictable with a disappointing end. Anyway this book taught me one thing or two about MPD, an alien but interesting subject."
3,Good But Not His Best,"I just finished reading ""Tell Me Your Dreams"" but I can tell you right now that there isn't much I can sincerely say about it other than my new discovery of MPD (Multiple Personalty Disorder). Sheldon is surely wearing down slowly, and it's about time he retires from his throne. I have read each and every one of this old man's books, and anybody who had done so will see what am talking about here. Sheldon's reign is over. If you what to see him at his best read his old books, and I mean any of his books that he wrote before ""Morning, Noon and Night."" My most favorite novel is his book, ""Master of The Game."""
5,Impossible to put this book down.,I have never previously read any Sydney Sheldons books. This is the first. I found it absorbing beyond all belief. I will be looking out for his other books now.
4,This will be a movie,"Not one of Mr. Sheldon's best, but still a very fast read. And has everything you need for a Mystery of the Week thriller that is rated R in the movies.The book's main character is Ashley Patterson who works at a Silicon Valley Computer Firm. She is being stalked by a vicious murder and is too insecure to tell anyone about it until its almost too late. Her father is a world famous heart surgeon who appears over protective of his daughter. To say much more would give away the reason for reading the book.The book is a murder mystery and medical courtroom drama all in one. Pick it up to read. It isn't perfect, but then again he based it on a real life story."
4,Very Good-I'll definitely read more Sheldon,"This is the very first Sheldon book that I read. A co-worker told me about it and said that it was really good and she was right. This is a very good book. It's divided into three parts and the first and second parts were the best (I'll admit, the ending was a little stale and unbelievable). I thought Ashley was a pretty good heroine. Based on this book, I will definitely read more of Sheldon's books (I'm already reading The Best Laid Plans now). So if you've never read a Sheldon book, before, read this. You'll get hooked."
1,A major disappointment,"I've been a huge Sheldon fan for many years so was eager to read Tell Me Your Dreams. It is hard to believe he wrote this shallow work with its cardboard characters and total lack of detail. I finally began just skimming it because it was so predictable and devoid of substance. Come on, Mr. Sheldon - you owe us one."
3,Tell Me Your Dreams,"I enjoy Sidney Sheilon books, but this one was a no brainer; I guessed the who, what where and why. I would not recommend this book."
3,"good, light, engrossing reading.","As with most Sheldon novels, it's not the most intellectual of books, but it is certainly absorbing! Sheldon never fails to surprise me! I didn't like the ending very much though. It was very unrealistic."
5,This is the best book anyone can read.,"I am a faithful fan of Sidney Sheldon. I have read, and own every book he has ever written. His work is simply the best. I havent read a book yet that can compare to his. I waited for a while to get this copy of this book. Well when I finally got it , it was even better than I thought it would be. I couldnt put it down. I had to read it until I got to the end. And it does leave a person in suspence. It has a most shocking conclusion. I loved it very much."
4,Great read for the weekend.,"I thought this book was excellent. Sidney does it again! This was definitely a shocker, as long as you don't go to the back of the book and read the author's notes like I did. But I still enjoyed it. Very different plot."
5,I lost two nights of sleep because of this !! terrific!!,"It's the typical Seldon novel !! fast paced , interesting and just terrific ! Normally I lose interest in any novel if the plot is weak , but here it was just a masterpiece !! I would recommend it for everyone who want a good novel.."
1,Trite and Predictable,"I have always been a fan of Sheldon's, but the last Sheldon book I liked was If Tomorrow Comes. After reading the reviews in the publishing journals for Tell Me Your Dreams, I fully expected to enjoy it. Now before you read the following, I have to admit that I am not the world's best judge of good writing and plots and been know to enjoy the trashiest of novels (I select fiction for a public library and am known as the Trash Queen for what I order). However, even though Sheldon based this on an actual case, I found it to be quite predictable (I can also be a little dense when it comes to figuring out a plot or theme) and trite. I finished the book but was quite annoyed with myself for doing so."
3,"Good book, however, at times a little predictable.","All in all, I enjoyed the book, however, many areas became very obvious. I basically knew what was going to happen before it happened. Although, the end definately sent a chill down my spine. If you are a faithful Sheldon fan, this is a must read. However, if you are just looking for a good murder novel, don't run to the racks."
3,Not his best,"Tell me your derams is not Sidney Sheldon's best. It is very easy to read and fast paced, but it is very predictable and short."
3,Not one of Sheldon's better ones...,Although Sheldon is on my 'wanted by author list' this book disappointed me - I know I was expecting more. There were not any surprises and I finished the book with a feeling of 'being hung out there' - does this mean a sequel? I hope not. Character development was lacking and the story line not as imaginative as Sheldon usually is... I did like the scene where the judge gave attorney David an apology...
2,worst ever,"Normally I can't wait to read a Sidney Sheldon, now I don't know if I ever want to read one agian. I found 'Tell me your dreams' very dissapointing. I must say its very easy to read but half way thrue the book the plot is already given a way, and it is not even a very good plot. This is book is nothing compared to 'If tommorow comes', my favorite."
1,dont tell me your dreams!,I somewhat hesitated to write a bad review about one of my best authors but this book is a real disaster. For a first time reader of Mr. Sheldon's books it might be rewarding but for a long time reader it wreaked of disappointment. Hope the next one is much better.
1,Una perdida de tiempo.,"Tell me your dreams, es un libro donde no aparecen los ingredientes esenciales que hacen de Sidney Sheldon el gran escritor que es. Quede muy desilusionada con este libro, el final fue muy debil y quedaron muchas partes inconclusas... tal parece que Sheldon lo hizo de prisa, o no lo ubiese escrito el."
1,ONE OF THE WORST BOOKS I HAVE EVER READ,BEING A SIDNEY SHELDON FAN I COULD NOT BELIEVE HE WROTE THIS BORING STORY. IT WAS A MAJOR LETDOWN.
2,Decent but not as good as his last books,"I think that this book was totally predictable. You new what was going on by the first few chapters and the so-called surprise ending really wasn't a surprise at all because it was so predictable. His earlier books especially ""The Doomsday Conspiracy"" were much better."
3,Good but predictable,"I felt is was a essential good book. But it had no suspense it was very predictable. Not like his books of the past like Morning,Noon, and Night also Best Laid Plans which was excellent and full of suspense."
2,Trite and predictable,I usually enjoy Sheldon's work. This one was so predictable I felt that it lacked suspense. He seemed to be on the MPD bandwagon and the book was just an excuse to disseminate information. His cause (and we as readers) would have been better served had he written a pamphlet on MPD and saved his talent for the kind of gripping tale he does so well.
1,"Predictable, shallow - what happened to the REAL S.Sheldon??","WHAT A TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT. I haven't read a Sidney Sheldon novel for a few years - I saw this at the library (thank goodness I did not spend my hard earned money on it)and thought ""great - a new S.Sheldon novel"". But was I ever disappointed! I had it figured out almost from the very start. I must echo all of your other 1 & 2 star reviewers - this was so elementary I could not believe I was reading Sidney Sheldon. His earlier works were superb - this was trash. No depth - short choppy sentences - and so predictable. I had to force myself to finish it - just in case there was going to be a big twist at the end. Sidney - what happened to you?"
3,"Exciting but to ""movieish""","Maybe it was the season's overwhelming qualities and the fact that I was exhausted when I began to read, but I never had a clue where the story was going!! I loved the first half of the book, quickly turning pages. I was then slammed with the discovery! At that point I was just a little let down as I had expected much more from having read Sheldon's past works. However, even when the book get predictable and way to ""Sunday night movie"", I enjoyed it to the last page even questioning my own thoughts right up too the last sentance."
2,Oh come on!!!,"This was one of the most predictable books I have ever read. We like to share books in the office and I had this one figured out after 80 pages which surprised some of the earlier readers in the office. It was not only predictable but it was written in a very choppy style that just seemed to irritate me. It seems like too many books are going for the 'incest' theme these days to account for the main character's behavior. And the split personality -- remember Sybil??? But, even though this book irritated me, I had to read through to the end because I can't leave anything unfinished! Sorry, Sydney Sheldon . . . better try again!"
2,"A good read, but fairly predictable","I am a Sheldon fan, and have read everything he has ever written. However, by page 44, I had pretty much figured out the ""big shock"" of this book. I continued to read, hoping for the usual twists a Sheldon book can take...only to find that the book is tame in comparison to his other works. For a seasoned reader, figuring out the key to the book so early on does not make for intriguing reading. It is well written, I did not give up on it before finishing it, but it ends with a whimper, not with the Sheldon trademarked bang. Mr. Sheldon, I await your next book in hopes that the cutting edge will return."
4,"not as good as his early books, but worth reading","I have read every Sheldon novel. The early ones are wonderful--so suspenseful. His last 3 or 4 have not been as good, but this one is worth reading. It is somewhat typical of Sheldon; however, lots of medical research has been done which is different that usual. I definitely recommend the book as long as the ""Sheldon Die-hards"" realize that it is about as good as the last three or so. A Must Read!"
1,Definately not his best.......,"I have loved all of the Sheldon books and always look forward to them. This book was just slower and never really grabbed me. I have found all of his books to be strictly for ""entertainment"" but this was at the bottom of the bunch for him."
2,First time and never again...,"Being in a hurry, I snagged this one because it was the #1 of some best seller list. My first and last Sheldon. The man may have had some great books but it's no excuse. If you take your work seriously, you'll forego deadlines (I'm guessing) and stay away from the predictable. In this case, Sheldon didn't. The story was well told but had the orginality you'd expect from an ABC made for TV movie. If you plan to buy your first Sheldon, do yourself a favor, buy another title and stay away from this one."
2,Second rate work from a first rate author,"I have read several books by Mr. Sheldon, and I must say that this is his worst yet. Halfway through the first section, it was obvious what was going to happen. I only finished this book out of a sense of obligation, that being that I hate to not finish a book. My advise would be to not waste your money on this book. If you absolutely have to read it, check it out from a library or borrow from a friend. It certainly is not worth the sticker price."
2,This book I'd been saving for a real treat was a downer.,"After being released from surgery in the hospital,I'd been looking forward to my favorite -Sidney Sheldon - and found this multiple personality book extremely morbid. He is an absolute master as an author and hope he comes out soon with a real delight as he usually does."
2,Mr. Sheldon Is Phoning It In,"Just because a book is a fast read does not make it a good read. This was a predictable, been-there-done-that story that appears to have taken about four days to write. If I were Sidney Sheldon, I would start to worry when my novels resemble my screenplays. Disappointing."
3,thrilling! ..a sheldon masterpiece...as usual,"i am an ardent fan of sidney sheldon and have read every published book of his....i literally stalk the bookstores in serach of new arrivals...""Tell me your dreams"" is based on a chilling concept....the climax sent shivers down my spine, but i cant help saying that the end left me wanting for more! ....I am one of those readers with an insatiable appetite for sheldon books.."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTING,"I've read and enjoyed a couple of Sheldon's books before this one, but this book turned out to be nothing short of disappointing. The fact that Toni and Alette were in fact Ashley's alters was SO obvious, long before the 'revelation' of it. Sheldon's attempt at creating a Grisham-style courtroom drama totally failed and his efforts to give us an insight in the complicated psychology involved in merging alters was boring, to say the least. The different stages of the book felt as though they had been badly glued together and, as it happens, it did all far apart long before the end was near. The storyline simply didn't work out and that's a pitty because Sheldon has been known to dazzle (loved 'If Tomorrow Comes'). I bought Sheldon's 'Best Laid Plans' already and I pray to God it turns out better than this one, as it failed miserably in trying to entertain the reader."
1,Did Sidney Sheldon really write this book?,"I think I was Sheldon's No.1 fan. I have read all of his books and they were superior. I always told my friends, nobody can write like him. I am asking myself, What on earth happened to him? Was he forced to write a book quickly or he'd lose his contract? I am not only disapointed but also sad because if this is what he is going to write from now on, then we lost the greatest writer that has ever been born. The book is horrible and I can't believe he had anything to do with it."
2,"THIS WAS MY FIRST SHELDON, AND UNDOUBTEDLY MY LAST.","Sheldon needs to make up his mind what he wants to do with TELL ME YOUR DREAMS. He starts of with a barely acceptable thriller, then switches suddenly to a trial drama, a sorry take-off on Grisham's A TIME TO KILL. Realizing how poorly he failed, he changes to a psychological drama. In the words of Beavis and Butthead, ""It sucks!"" The only thing that keeps you reading is that it's bursting with potential, and, with a better author (Grisham?), could soar. An appropriate sequel should be entitled SORRY SID. But could it be any worse?"
1,Maybe it was a mistake.,"This book reads like a rough draft. I can only guess that Sidney Sheldon sent the wrong copy to the publishing company, and they in turn didn't read it before they printed it."
1,Sheldon Wrote This Garbage???,"Let me start out by saying that I have DEVOURED every Sidney Sheldon novel I have ever picked up. His work usually draws me in and doesn't let go until well after I've finished the book.This book, however, was a HUGE disappointment. He usually has such rhythm and such wonderful character development, but this one just fell flat. The characters were predictable...hell, the entire book was predictable. It was almost a non-book.It was bad. Absolutely the worst thing Sheldon has ever written. The ending left me feeling gypped, and compelled me to go online and trash the book.For anyone new to Sheldon's work, check out RAGE OF ANGELS instead...or anything else he's written. He's a great author (usually)."
1,Wins the predictability award,"Sidney has lost his edge. This book was so bad that if his name was not Sheldon, I can't believe it would have been published. This reader was always five steps ahead and it was so predictable, you couldn't believe it. Not to mention, but Sidney should brush up on his courtroom drama. Accustomed to Martini and Grishom, even a non-lawyer could tell that the court room scenes were amateurishly done. This was a very disappointing read."
1,Sheldon has sold out on his public,"As with his last four or five books, Sheldon wastes his innovative mind on shlock, presumably so he can churn out books faster and reap the reward$. The book is uneven, written on an elementary school level, has terrible character development, and is utterly predictable, particularly if you've read his books before. Even the protagonist, who potentially can be the most complex character Sheldon has ever created, is passed off to us as one-dimensional. I wouldn't be so hard on Mr. Sheldon, except after reading ""The Other Side of Midnight"" and ""Master of the Game"", I know what he is capable of. My advice to Sheldon is to take a few extra minutes/hours/days/weeks/months to develop his books, or he'll have at least one less reader."
5,This is one good book,"This is one of ""THE BEST"" book I have ever. It is through this book that that I came to know about ""MULTIPLE PERSONALITY DISORDER"". There are about a thousand people suffering from this disease. Some of them even have more than 300 alters. This is a must read book. So go get it!"
1,What happened to the REAL Sidney Sheldon?,I cannot believe this is the work of Mr. Sheldon. Most of his earlier books were filled with suspense and many twists and turns of the plot. This was way below par and very predictable; I was very disappointed. I see Mr. Sheldon is scheduled to be on A&E's Biography tonight (1/18/00) - I wonder if he will apologize to his longtime readers for this trashy work? As another reviewer suggests perhaps he has just run out of ideas. It's very sad to see that he has come to this.
3,"a clear ""not-a-whodunit-shelon"" again!!","This book is one of those tomes that we wish could be unwritten in parts and rewritten in full. After a rather rockety start, sheldon seems to be wavering between hot action--somethinmg he does well--and a Ludlumesque psycho-realism--which he does NOT do well. An easy read, if you are caught between check-ins at an airport lounge."
3,"A Simple, Easy, Forgettable Read","This review is for the Warner Books paperback edition reissued in June 2005, 363 pages of story. TELL ME YOUR DREAMS was on the USA Today top 150 best sellers list for 26 weeks between September 1998 and October 1999, reaching a peak position of number five.Three lovely young ladies who work for Global Computer Graphics in Silicon Valley are implicated in the brutal murder and mutilation of five more or less nice men. Although perplexing, the evidence against them seems irrefutable and by the time the case goes to trial we know who done it, but not until the story is nearly finished will we understand why.TELL ME YOUR DREAMS has cops, detectives, lawyers and doctors, but it does not dwell on police procedure, sleuthing, legalize or medical practice. Set in California, it touches on Quebec, London and Rome but with the slimmest of description. This is a simple, easy, forgettable read."
1,Keeping the pot boiling,"""Astounding, startling... almost impossible to believe"" says the back cover of this book. Well, if we're talking about how bad it is, I'd agree. A Flesch-Kincaid readability test would probably indicate a third-grader would have no trouble understanding this book. Good for you if you're 8 years old, but I'm a grown woman.The shocking truth about the murders was so easy to figure out I kept thinking this can't be it, can it? There must be a twist on top of the twist. I actually came up with a few ideas myself, without much mental strain, so why couldn't Sheldon have done it? After all, he's the author here.Bad, bad, bad."
1,What has happened to Sidney,I have read all of Sidney Sheldon's books. The last 3 books have been a waste of my time. What has happened to the Sidney Sheldon who wrote books that you could NOT put down? It has never taken me 2 weeks to finish one of his books--until now. I don't think I can pick up another one of his new books. Maybe I'll start from the beginning and read his old stuff!
3,not the sidney stuff,this is one of the most dissapointing novel of sidney. it start's all very well. but the ending is disator.you feel cheated. you feel more confused about this novel than you started it. you feel as if your hard earned money is wasted.
1,"Too, shallow","I started out enjoying the suspense Sheldon offered with his earlier books, however the last three disappointed me. The topic (MPD) was unique but alas Sidney you're becoming too elemntary. After reading John Grisham, Sheldon has become too predictable and mundane."
1,Worn out theme and totally predictable,I was very disappointed in Mr. Sheldon's latest outing. I've always enjoyed his books. The MPD theme has been used too much in mysteries and I was sorry he chose it. I had the entire story figured out by the time I reached page 50.
4,very interesting but it is a mystery in itself,this novel makes good reading but its ending is not the usual sheldon type. ASHELY PATTERSON is troubled by her 2 alters. SIDNEY has taken a very differnt & unknown topic called multiple persnality disorder. BUT the ending leaves the reader more preplexed about mpd then he/she started the novel.I would say this novel is worth your money
3,Entertaining but Predictable,"Easy to read and good suspense-building in Book 1. But when starting the part on David, it seems to be more and more conventional and predictable. I'm a bit dissatisfied when the story ends suddenly and I found it unrealistic that the ""complicated"" case can be solved so ""easily"". Yet, it's still entertaining anyway!"
1,Very Predictable!,This book is an utter disappointment! It deviated from the usual suspenseful and riveting works of Sheldon. The plot and the characters are very predictable. It would also make you think whether it's realistic for a person with MPD(Multiple Personality Disorder) to be good and terribly evil at the same time. The modern Dr. Jekkyl and Mr. Hide crap. This book is a waste of time and money!
4,Intriguing,"I have always love Sheldon, I have read everything he has written, and this one I think lacks the usual Sheldon touch. I mean after reading Master of the Game, Rage of Angels... it's like something is missing. I don't like to think that he lost his magic already. But as always, he just don't let you read but makes you learn a thing or two about the subject. I am still eagerly waiting for his next novel."
1,FLUFF!!!,"This the first (and last) time I have read a Sidney Sheldon book. Talk about waste. This book is written for people that have a 5 second attention span. There is NO development of characters. The author glosses over months/years of time by saying... ""Five months later""... or ""It had now been three years..."" This book reminds me of a Melrose Place episode...a lot of action, no substance."
5,The book is enthralling right till the depth.,"I read this book and was so fascinated by it, that I just couldn't do anything else. This book is so captivating that it keeps you tied down to your seats. When I started reading it, I knew nothing of multiple personality disorder. I actually thought that the three girls were different and one of them was the killer or someone was trying to frame them. On reading further down the lines......I discvored the occurence of the phenomena multiple personality disorder and it just enthralled me. To top it all the book is based on a real event just puts me to shock. Imagine a girl going through all this in reality. Sidney Sheldon can weave realities into an adventurous and a mysterious plot. There is no one in comparison to Sidney Sheldon. He is the best."
2,I can't beleive that Sheldon wrote about MPD!,"Sidney, Sidney, Sidney! You can do so much better than that.I have been reading Sheldons books for over 15 years, but this one was a real dissapointment."
1,Totally predictable...the book jacket gives it away!,"Its sad to see more and more of the authors I once enjoyed are bombing. This is amateur all they way. The Ashley character and her two alters are not too bad, but a little challenge for the seasoned reader as well as some suspense would have been nice. This is 9th grade reading at its best."
5,Fasinating,"This book is a real graber from the first few pages. I didn't intend to read it, but couldn't put it down from the minute I started it till I finished it. Multiple personalities is something all of us have to some degree. Sheldon weaves this into his characters in such a way that becomes fasinating as we recognize fairly common but distinct personality types, perhaps that of our own at one time or another.It's a fast read with a Sidney Sheldon surprise ending of course.Get's you thinking."
3,A BIT TRITE,"OK maybe he got lazy..maybe he thought we would not notice because he IS SYDNEY SHELDON, but the fact that a ""famous surgeon"" does not know of the term ""multiple personality disorder"" ?? I found that and a few other ""minor"" details over looked. may be i was a little too critical ..i did like it.. i just found it ..well.....simple.. .i hope the next i read by him will be better...but i WILL read him again...he is an easy read..."
1,Like a lame Made-for-TV Movie,"This book was quite predictable and pretty weak. The introduction he made to Toni & Alette didn't even hint that they might be alters of Ashley's - it's like he made that up after the first chapters were written. I went back and re-read the first few Ashley/Toni/Alette chapters and it doesn't ""jive"" with the rest of the book.This was quite a disappointment. It was written like a bad made for TV movie - especially the chapters on the trial. The arguments were weak. It sounded like something written out of a junior high school mock-trial. And the reasons for her creating her alters (I won't give it away) - oh come on! He could have come up with something a little more creative. Who didn't see THAT coming?After ""The Doomsday Conspiracy"" I promised myself that there would be no more Sidney Sheldon novels in my life....I wish now I would have stuck with that thought."
1,From a disappointed reader,"I used to be faithful reader of Sidney Sheldon. Sadly, I think I'll stop being one. I was really disappointed with this book. Anyone with half a brain could figure out that the three female characters were really one person by the time they had read the first half of the book. And the multiple personality stuff was SO obvious that I felt I already knew how the story would end. Maybe Mr.Sheldon is tiring."
4,Factual!,"Sidney you have done it again. The suspense of knowing in the back of my mind, the three were one made the book that much enjoyable. It kept me turning the pages wondering how in the world is her Lawyer going to pull this one off. Keep giving us more Sidney, I'll buy them!"
2,"""WHERE'S WALDO"", WHERE'S SHELDON??","THIS BOOK WAS OUITE BORING, NOTHING LIKE THE OLD SHELDON, OR SHOULD I SAY THE YOUNGER SHELDON.I'M SURE HE MADE HIS MILLIONS ON IT WITH HIS FAITHFUL READERS!!!"
3,NOT THE TYPICAL SHELDON STYLE,"THIS BOOK SEEMED LIKE SHELDON HAS LOST IT A BIT. NOT AS DEEP, AND WAS RATHER A VERY SIMPLE BOOK, NO BIG SURPRISES! I DO BELEIVE SHELDON IS 81 YEARS OLD NOW, GUESS HE IS SLOWING DOWN."
3,Not bad but somethings left out,"Ever since Morning, Noon and Night Sheldon seems to be getting down. I was hoping he do come out with something really better than his last two works, but maybe everybody were having high expectation of him that's why the disappointment was that great. Hope he has better ideas to keep his fans bind to their seats. Overall, Tell Me Your Dreams is really better than the last two, is worth your money!"
4,Very good. Never thought it would end the way it did!,"This is not a typical Sidney Sheldon novel, that you could sort-of predict the ending. I was very surprised! I loved the book, just like I love ALL of Sidney Sheldon's novels. Couldn't put it down! I didn't figure out that the three women were the same person until the author spelled it out in the story. I recommend buying the book."
3,Not that great at all,"Sheldon is slipping if this is the best he can do. I looked forward to enjoying both books i bought from amazon this last order, but only 'The Triumph and the Glory' passed the test. 'Tell Me Your Dreams' was far from what I expect of a great writer like Sidney Sheldon. I hope his next one is better."
2,Total waste of time,"After reading the book you will wonder whether it is really the work of sheldon or someone who is passing off as sheldon.This book starts with the promise of a great thriller but once the MPD comes into play,that's it,there ends the story,the court room sequences are amateurishly handled,there is no credibility and the ending is a big disappointment,sorry sheldon we expect much much better works from you."
2,Disappointing to say the least,Hey...was this book really written by Sidney Sheldon??? Too predictable...like a bad made-for-TV movie. I was able to predict the outcomes before I got to them. So unlike some of Sheldon's other works. Maybe Sheldon produced this book quickly because he needed a fast buck - consequently the quality suffered. I'll definately be more cautious about picking up one of his books in the future.
1,Did Mr.Sheldon use a ghost writer???,I kept checking the cover of the book to check the author's name! Did Mr. Sheldon use a ghost writer? What a disappointment! Not at all in keeping with Mr. Sheldon's usual great style and superb character development.
4,Great fast-paced story,"I really enjoyed this book. I had a hard time putting it down. It moved along very quickly (like all Sheldon's books). The only disappointment was the ending. Usually the ending is a surprise, but not this time. Other than that, this book is very entertaining. Highly recommended."
3,"Good beginning, but ending falls flat","After being disappointed with ""The Best Laid Plans"" and ""Morning, Noon, and Night"", I was hoping that Sidney Sheldon's new novel would be better than those two were. I was wrong. While ""Tell Me Your Dreams"" started out really good, the story dragged on from the middle to the very predictable ending. Whatever happened to the Sidney Sheldon who wrote such brilliant, well-crafted novels like ""Windmills of the Gods"" and ""Nothing Lasts Forever""? Now it appears he writes just to pass the time. If his next book is as bad as the last three, then I will probably never read a Sidney Sheldon novel again."
2,The same old Sidney Sheldon stuff.,This book is a typical S.S. stuff. The main twist in the plot is on an very weak foundation. Expected more out out of this book.
3,Story comes out of the sky--and just stands there!,"With due apologies to Yes, that's how I felt after reading this book. There were too many issues left unresolved. The lawyer just disappears, as does the father. While ""happily ever after"" isn't a precondition for ending a good book, I was left particulary unfulfilled at the end of this one. There was also the problem that Dr. Patterson's step daughter seemed to remain three years old for a period of five or more years. I wouldn't recommend this one."
1,WHO TOLD THIS GUY HE COULD WRITE??,"Talk about writing for the simple-minded. And did someone say, ""surprise ending?"" I had it all figured out by the end of the first chapter, INCLUDING the so-called exciting climax. This story has already been done--about a hundred times! Maybe that's why it is so predictable? Anyway, it reminded me of why I've never cared for Sidney Sheldon's books. I'll never read another one!"
4,This was a good story however...,I really enjoyed this book. This was the first Sidney Sheldon story I have ever read. I was very interesting untill you got to the trial and then it got a little slow... But it picked up again!
3,Sheldon ALMOST did it again!,"The novel held all the promise of a great read but somewhere along the line Sheldon just did not seem to care about the plot. Most reders will easily guess the ""twist"" by page 20. I am a true Sidney Sheldon fan but please Mr. Sheldon try a little harder next time. Good classic ending."
2,Not one of Sidney Sheldon's best books,"Sidney sheldon is one of my favorite authors, but this book seemed like two or three other books I've previously read. Predictable and not at all that much different from any other mystery and suspense personality disorder book I've read."
4,Good,"The book was definitely entertaining, but it did make me a bit depressed. But it certainly is worth a read."
2,bad metal,"I've bought 2 of these sliders to fix a failing garage door opener. The metal used to make the threads that ride the screw drive on the door opener is very soft. Any irregularities in the operation of the door will strip these threads to a smooth surface in no time. I finally gave up on repairing my opener with new slides and bought a whole new system. If this part fails, replacing it will only be a temporary solution, because it will fail again."
3,When the Moops Ruled in Europe,"Make sure you get the corrected DVD packaging which is titled ""When the Moops Ruled in Europe"". The old terminology ""moors"" is politically incorrect."
1,Ugh,I thought I would be seeing educational information about the African Moors (which means black) since it comes up with the other educational videos about African Ancestry. Very educational but very misleading.
4,This was a interesting history on the Moors,"When the Moors ruled in Europe is a documentary with some good educational value.However, I still suffer from the price versus the content problem. I still feel that I am not getting my money's worth. Overall I still enjoyed the film and the information about the Moors. If you are interested about the period of the Moors ruling Spain than this DVD is a good addition to your collection."
4,The Moors Ruling the Iberian Peninsula is a Misconception!,"Dear All,Hello,The fact raised by Mr. Jebril that the Moors are an ethnic African Black race is true. But also in fact one must know that the era which is called or referred to as to the Moors ruling Iberia is a total misconception. As known to all Historians that the Arabs from the Near East Area (The Levant) referred to then as the Umayyads are the ones who invaded The Iberian Peninsula and ruled for centuries. However, like many examples in history, it is only normal for great armies to be formed of different ethnic groups; and among the Umayyads army then were also Moors. I am sure that you will never find any historical Arabic book that would refer to the Moors as the invaders or the rulers of Andalusia.RegardsI suggest that all Who wants to write about that Particular Era to refer to it as to;The Umayyads in Europe?"
1,Moors were Black. Not just Muslim. It never says that in the film.,"This Film was ok but i spent almost 2hours and they only made it seem like they were Muslim. Being Muslim is not a race! They never said that the Moors were black! That's what Moors means! Its a colors.When you mention Moors its talking about Black people. They made it seem like they were Arabs! That's like telling the story of Michael Jordan, telling all the great things he did, but never saying he was black! Saying the moors were Muslim is like saying Jordan was a Bull. If you were going to tell the story you have to say they were black! White people wanna always tell a story with leaving out the fact black people were involved. Just like the Egyptians!"
2,Positive learning to be taken out of a sloppy documentary,"Many things to be learned from this documentary but full of glaring holes to be taken too seriously.One example is the use of the term ethnic cleansing when the historian herself kept re-iterating that many residents were local converts (even though that is disputed by an interview she herself conducts near the end of the documentary). How can you ethnically cleanse when you claim to have native Iberians, Arabs, Africans and others being expelled because of their beliefs? Perhaps she means ethnic cleansing of Muslims but then Islam is a religion and not an ethnic group so that doesn't really apply.This struck me as good Muslims, bad Christians propaganda that unfortunately covers up what the historian meant to shed light on and that is the positive contributions that were made by a Muslim state in Europe that has been forgotten."
2,Fear of a Black Hat DVD - Quality issues,"First of all, I love this movie. It's an extremely funny parody of the hip-hop world and what happens within. I am disappointed with the quality of the video as it is very gritty and lacks a regular dvd quality."
5,"IF YOU LIKED CB4, YOU'LL LOVE THIS","Great film from start to finish, had this film on vhs for years, so getting it on dvd with the extras was like watching for the first time, well worth the money"
5,Top of your must-view list,"One of the funniest, most underrated movies of our time. Don't know why it was overlooked in theatrical release. Think ""This Is Spinal Tap"" meets Chappelle's Show. Wonderfully explicit and tasteless just like the music of the era, and in a hilarious, not offensive way. Definitely a must-view if you liked early 90s rap music (NWA, Snoop Doggy Dogg, Dr. Dre)."
5,A cult classic,"This movie is the ""Spinal Tap"" for the hip hop set. This movie is very dated, but very hilarious, the jokes never get old. I have seen this movie hundreds of time and am glad to see it come to DVD finally. Rusty Cundieff is a talented writer, as well as a great actor, and should be noted as one of the best that black cinema has to offer."
5,Funniest movie you never saw.............Straight out tha Butt,"FOABH is one of my all time favorites. My Dad ""discovered"" this movie reading a Siskel and Ebert review. Believe it or not but S&E gave Fear of a Black Hat ""Two Thumbs Up"". That right there speaks volumes about this movie. If two frumpy movie critics gave this comedy their blessing it must be pretty damn funny. Remeber.... Don't shoot until you see the Whites."
2,I'm afraid it is not funny...,"I expected this movie to be side splitting funny, didn't live up to the hype."
2,Funny for people who haven't seen Spinal Tap.,"I couldn't even finish this movie. Had they not ripped off bits from This Is Spinal Tap about 7 times half way through, I might not have turned it off. I am a fan of the ""mockumentary"" as much as the next guy but this is just bad. Don't waste your time."
2,not funny,"the ""jokes"" are all telegraphed and almost all of them not funny at all. this is nowhere near as good as the rock group spoof ""this is spinal tap."" with all the material that can be used to poke fun at rappers it's surprising just how lacking this film is. the only reason i gave it 2 stars instead of 1, is that the rap songs are actually quite good and some are funny like ""peanuts.""but as good as the videos are they don't make up for the painful experience of watching nearly 2 hours of telegraphed, unfunny jokes."
5,Incredibly Funny!,"Fear of a Black Hat has got it all. The parody-of-urban music movie is a must see for any hip hop lover. Words don't describe how funny this movie is.""...so it's like yo'... we've got hat's!"""
4,Amazing,CB4 can't hold a candle to NWH! Rusty Cundieff and Larry B. Scott turn in high-caliber performances on a film that has recieved little to no public consideration.
5,a skillful blend of rap music satire and political comment,"Fear of A Black Hat is one of the freshest satires of its time. It hits on various themes in the African American rap world. It points out why Vanilla Ice (Vanilla Sherbet) and Hammer (alias Stammer) could not be accepted by other black rappers. But it also aims its satirical guns at the entire rap culture by showing the viewer why many rap artists' lyrics and their actions do not always jive. For example, the video of a ""gansta's life is no fun,"" shows the NWH members having the time of their lives in a world they say is negative. Very clever satire which tested the NWH actors to their fullest. Don't wait another moment. Watch it today."
2,Disappointing Sound Quality,We started with Ultra Mix 2 and were really quite disappointed in the sound quality of Ultra Mix.
2,Look for another DDR mix,"DDR is without a doubt one of the most fun games I've ever played, and I've been playing it for a little over two years now. If you want to get into DDR or are into it already and want a new mix, look somewhere else. Good songs in here are a rarity. If you really want to play DDR, get Max, Max2, or Extreme on the PS2. If you only have an Xbox and are going to shell out the money for this game anyway, don't say I didn't warn you."
4,"A tona fun, great bonding","My wife and I bought this for our daughter and found that we have enjoyed it just as much as her. We purchased this to be a potential ffamily game and something that both my wife and I could enjoy together and couldn't be happier with it. There is a revue a little above mine that states it is a single player non-connected game, I am not sure if this reviewer was intending this referance to the packaged version, but we bought the extra pad and everything works great. I highly reccomend this to all users looking for some simple fun. The difficulty settings are reasonable, and one you realize what the game is asking you to do--ie dance and not play a game per se--it is loads of fun. For those of you that know how to salsa, there is a song for you too.I found the tracks enjoyable and totally entertaining and cain't wait till I hook my stereo up to get things really going."
4,My 2 Cents,"First 2 chapters are just Introduction to C# language and Windows Forms. Chapter 3 intro to ADO.NET components. Chapter 4 is Data Components in VS.NET. After chapter 4, all chapters are worth and well explained. XML chapter is great. I definitely like ODBC.NET chapter which covers MySQL and Oracler database connectivity.Good cahpters on Web Services and ASP.NET.Not bad for beginners and intermediate developers. Didn't see any security and performance coverage though."
5,MySQL and Oracle Coverage,"Actually I found book useful. Solved my MySQL connectivety problems. I like all ODBC .Net Data Adapter chapters. Even covers Oracle, Sybase and other DB connectivity."
2,Not quite a good book,"I was extremely disappointed after reading this based on most other reviews. It does not provide any detailed information about ADO.NET nor does it give me anything to go on when it comes to database tips and tricks in the managed world. I was going to give a rating of 1, but decided against it, because I believ the author must have spent many hours doing screen dumps of the way too many pictures in the book! Amazing how one can fill up to half the book with pictures that does no good for the understanding of the various subjects. I wonder if it shows how the author got his very limited knowledge on databases?"
1,"Poor content, poorly written","How come anyone can rate this book 5 stars? There's nothing in this book that deserves a rating like that. Its written in arather awful English although it seems that the editors have been able to improve on it. I also think its evident that theauthor really does not know too much about databases in practice as suggested by another reviewer. There are so manyplaces in the book were I wonder if even a price of $[money]would be justified, but I just do not think so. This book deservesa rating of 1, and its nowhere near the quality APress normaly publishes, like Vaugnhs books."
2,"Hmm, what did I just read?","I am not sure what to say about this book. I generally love the high quality books from Apress but this one is a little different. There is a lot of pages in the book but I think that 1/3 of them is a waste. Ther's too many pictures and there os no real indepth coverage of the topics. Okay, the writing is fairly competent but I am left with a feeling that the author does not know what she is talking about. Just not worth the money."
1,Totally Unfocused...,"This book covers way too much ground at a very shallow depth. This is not a good buy for an experienced software developer. I think a title of ""A Beginner's Guide to Things Related to ADO.net"" would be more appropriate."
1,"Sorry, just not good enough to publish","I wonder why it is that any publisher will publish poorly written books like this. You get this mixed feeling right from the beginning of the book and then as you continue to read the chapters you sit back and realize that the author has absolutely nothing to offer you, because he doesn't know what he is talking about. Why on Earth would anyone prefer 2-3 shots of the same dialog within the space of just a few pages? Okay, the content of the dialogs are not the same but its much neater to just reference a dialog once its been showed once.I am not exactly a beginner, but even if I had been I am convinced that this book wouldn't have given me much to go on."
1,Misleading,"I find it curious that a reviewer from New York and a reviewer from Bombay use identical language to give this book a rave review. The title of this book is most misleading, it should read something like ""An Absolute Novice guide to doing ADO.NET with Visual Studio"". And if this doesn't describe you, the book will be almost completely worthless to you..."
1,Very disappointing,"THis book is a joke. There is nothing in it than I can use in my daily work. Although there are some neat xml stuff, its beginners stuff, and as far as the authros knowledge of database is conercned, well I will leave you guessing."
1,Time Waste,I didn't like this book at all.I think author is not clear what he is trying to tell.May be he is very new to ADO.NET.Guys its not worth it to buy this book.I want my money back..
2,Tedium,"This book may be useful to someone who is a complete beginner to .NET and C#. However, I found it to be the most tedious programming book I have ever read. The author would list 3 pages of code, then change one line, and list the 3 pages again (with the one line difference)! Also, the author never tired of explaining in some depth (like 3 paragraphs) how the 3 different .NET providers had the same basic class taxonomy (but different implementations). After reading the same 3 paragraphs (more or less) for about the 10th time, I swore to myself that I would puke if I encountered those same 3 paragraphs one more time. Fortunately, I decided to pick up and read ""ADO.NET Examples and Best Practices for C# Programmers"" instead. I learned more in 50 pages there than I learned in 400 pages of this title."
2,Look somewhere else for insight and innovation,"I can recommend Mahesh's c-sharpcorner.com site but not this book. It goes over the same bland ""this is what a data reader does and does fast, but these are all the great things you can do with a dataset."" What about strategies for accessing columns and data types? What about hiding data providers by using a utility class that feeds your apps data using IDbConnections and IDbCommands? This book has nothing special to say.Plus, this book contains an infuriating number of grammatical mistakes.I'm trying _ADO.NET Examples and Best Practices for C# Programmers_ next. If this book failed you too, look for my review there."

4,Pretty good primer for beginners,"I found the book fairly informative and basic for those of us completely new to timeshare. I have to think some of the reviewers here never read this book, because the author indeed goes out of her way to reference informative webpages (including tug2.net mentioned here and others) for further information.Did a good job of breaking down the ""lingo"" that I had a hard time slogging through online. A good place to start, but not the be-all and end-all if you really need to learn about time shares, but I don't think it was meant to be. But this book is certainly a good jumping-off place."
2,More of the same,"When I discovered that this book was written by the same person who wrote ""Surviving a Timeshare Presentation"", I really knew I had been taken. This should be ""Surviving a Book Sale"", because both books are weak with substance and are written by someone who probably couldn't give it away as a sales person. Why do non-producers become Authors? One of the books had a sticker on the front that said ""Personally autographed"" and on the inside cover, she had scribbled ""Lisa"". Give me a break. If you want to learn about Timeshare, take a presentation with a reputable company and ask lots of questions. They will answer them for you and they will even do the math correctly when they show you the purchase options."
4,A good book if you are thinking of purchasing or just curious about time shares,"I thought some of reviews were harsh and unfair. This book is the best one on the market I could find on this somewhat confusing topic. In addition, the information on buying a time share from an individual (rather than the developer), or on e-bay is probably where the bargains are found. The author points out the wisdom and the pitfalls in trying to do this. The book has a web site from which the author answered some additonal questions that I wrote in to her. Timeshares are a close call from a financial standpoint in my own opinion, however time share units are typically better than a hotel, e.g. kitchen and other amenities.If you are thinking of purchasing a time share, or just curious to learn more about it, I would recommend this book."
5,Full Of Good Information,"I really enjoyed reading the book the first time, and will definitely re-read it. I found the information about trading particularly interesting, since I've been through a number of presentations and always received conflicting information on what the best trade was. I'm not sure what the other reviewer was talking about when he mentioned ""timeshare brochures"" because that's the one thing about timeshares that I never quite understood---why they never had any brochures of any relevant information. Good book and exactly what I expect from the people at the ""Dummies"" titles."
1,Rare to find a Dummies author with such uninformed views,"There's a good Dummies book to be written about timesharing, but this isn't it.The author's bias as a former timeshare salesperson repeatedly shows as she justifies the ridiculously inflated prices charged for developer timeshares and nudges the reader in the direction.Her bias as an Orlando resident -- and salesperson at TS Orlando properties -- causes her to push that area as the most valuable place to buy a timeshare, but most folks familiar with timesharing would tell you Orlando is already overbuilt and has poor resale and trading value.Just a disappointing read."
2,Biased,"This book reads like a timeshare presentation. ""If you finance after 10 years it is only 90 dollars a day a very good price"" oh yeah then you have to pay maintenance fees.She presents some good links to better sources but for a unbiased opinion look elsewhere."
4,Great,"Great blanket, best of its kind for the price. More than large enough for two people to sit on comfortably. I ordered navy, but the waterproof part is black and the fleece is navy (not how the picture showed, but not a problem)."
5,A real bargain,"You can't beat the price of these blankets. I bought 2, and have just ordered 2 more. They have a soft fleece top, and a waterproof backing. I put one in my car for my dogs to lie on when they are wet. I gave one to a friend who likes to camp. These are great blankets - well worth the price."
2,Not as described,"While this is a nice blanket, and will probably work for most people, it is NOT waterproof. It is water-resistant, and will most likely keep you dry from wet grass, but if you dump water into it, water will leak through to the other side."
1,NOT Waterproof!,I purchased several of these blankets specifically because they are suppose to be waterproof. They are not! The smallest amount of water will seep through.
3,It is not a cookbook!,"I had wrong expectations when I bought the book. In French there is a bid difference between ""cuisine moléculaire"" or molecular cooking and ""gastronomie moléculaire"" or molecular gastronomy. In English we use molecular gastronomy for both the science and its applications in kitchens...For those who want to do spheres, nouveau genre spaghettis or airs, this is the place to go:[...]"
1,book doesn't earn this title.. far from it,"great book if you want to read about half-ass explanations about how to make a good broth or center yolk when boiling eggs... ""Molecular Gastronomy"" is a very wrong title for this book, which doesn't explain chemistry or human digestive system. Moreover, the entire book could be shrunk to 20 pages, if it were written concisely."
4,Wishing for a hard cover! :),"This book is a collaboration between cooking knowledge and its science. I have work for more than 15 yrs in the food and beverage industry and have refined my skills in an attempt to become the best chef I can be.Instead of paying and arm and a leg in schools, I dare you to read this book, not only to learn the secret behind the closed doors of the kitchen but to also know the extent of the workings and dealing behind the Chefs that produce your delicious meals!!"
5,Another Gift,"Gift for the culinary student. Was excepted and appreciated. I hope he understood what he was reading, it was mud to me."
2,"good, but","good, but, not very complete, inaccurate and simplistic. if you have read harold mcgee, it is a bit simplistic, un-scientific, and extremely biased. good for the beginner or home cook. short stories (and lack of scientific guidelines) are good for those without the patience for ""on food and cooking""..."
4,Entertaining but not the best cooking reference,I was looking for something to use as a reference for how to prepare different types of food. This definitely is not it. It is an entertaining read but it does not really have the level of detail I was looking for when I got this book. The best I have gotten so far is On Food and Cooking: The Science and Lore of the Kitchen (or something like that) by Harold McGee.
2,Style Over Substance,"This is a ramshackle album drenched with whiskey and regret, engineered to sound like a VU bootleg circa 1969. That isn't necessarily a bad thing, however, it can't hide the fact that a set of weak songs lurks beneath the dense atmosphere."
1,Not worth the money,"This CD is really not worth the money you pay for it. I bought it thinking it was going to be great, as a friend of mine recommended it (and usually has great music taste) and I had heard We've Been Had (partially in the Saturn Ion commercial). The songs are really boring. I didn't get any emotion from listening it to it. The songs are really quiet and bland. It'd put you to sleep from how boring it is instead of keeping you entertained. It took me two lisens to hear the whole cd as I fell asleep during the first 20 minutes or so. Although it does have some nice instumentals, it's absolutely not worth paying for."
1,Lets rip off early 80's post punk!,"At what point does a tribute band become shameless rip off artists? I would say w/ this Walkmen album. You can hear bits of Gang of Four, The Chameleons, PIL, early Cure (17 seconds and Faith), and Joy Division throughout. The guitar sound completely rips off The Chameleons circa ""Script of the Bridge"". Completely empty is how you feel after listening to this - and you'll find yourself reaching for your copy of ""17 Seconds"" or ""entertainment!"". This guys voice is awful - a shame they can't ape the amazing vocals of Mark Burgess or Ian Curtis. The worlds biggest cover band is on display with this release. Save your money and save originality."
4,Everyone Who Pretended to Like Me Is Gone,"Length - 53:56The gloomy New York quintet known as The Walkmen succeeded in making a beguiling amalgam of moody guitars, pianos and organs that elicit such occurences as the blizzard of 96' and the evanescent, pretend fans. As the record rolls, Hamilton Lighthauser's caterwaul grows a bit irritating, but the originality and spacy blend of off-kilter harmonies and the lead singer's bray make due for a very bizarre, yet pleasing listen. My two favorites are We've Been Had and Wake Up, the hits. Anyone searching for unique music should get this album."
4,Follow the white rabbit,"Theatrical and inviting. It is not a masterpeice and not trying to be, but it is surprisingly good and that makes it all the better.From the beginning with They're Winning and Wake Up the low fi sounds play like a soundtrack. The voice of the singer tells the story with emotion that the listener can understand while not having to take on that emotion.The piano and cadence of the driving drum beats set it apart from its peers. It also makes each track seem bigger than life without being overdone. It comes in furious waves that break gently, especailly the song Revenge Wears No Wrist Watch.My favorite song is We've been had or That's the Punch line, but each track is well placed to make the album solid from start to finish.Then you play it again and wonder..."
1,Don't waste your money,"I purchased Frommer's guide to Japan for a trip this spring. It not only was very helpful, but it gave me a great insight into the culture and people of Japan. This book was the exact opposite. Furthermore it contains a number of errors. For example it discusses the guards at the Islands War Memorial--they don't exist. It gets addresses wrong. Very disappointing"
3,"Not superbly designed, recommendations are hit-or-miss","It isn't an extremely well-designed book. It's sleek, but I find myself digging around trying to find exactly what I'm looking for. The reviews are fairly accurate, but we've had some sub-par experiences at several of the places. I guess it's the old curse of once you're recommended to tourists, you sit on your laurels and watch them stream in without trying to stay great."
4,Review of Frommer's Buenos Aires,"I have always found Frommer's guides very helpful. However, I don't think I will ever use a Kindle version again. It was difficult to flip through pages to find what I needed. It is much more helpful to have the hard copy. While I love my Kindle, I won't use it again for this purpose. I would probably have given the book a 5 star rating under another circumstance."
5,Frommer's Buenos Aires guidebook review,"Very poorly organized. There is no overall map, showing what portions of the city are shown on detail maps. So there is no way to locate anything, such as the cruise ship dock, using this guidebook. I wanted to know the location in Buenos Aires Sheraton Libertado hotel where we'll be staying. Sadly, this giant hotel is missing from the text and maps of this guidebook. I bought the newest available version. Nowhere in the book is the date of publication shown.This guidebook is of no use to me, mainly because it is so disorganized that the maps are useless. Also the total lack of information on major hotels, the cruise ship dock, and things to do Buenos Aires detracts from the usefulness of this guidebook. I bought it because previous Frommers guidebooks I've bought in the past were very good. However, Frommer's needs to have another author totally re do this guidebook."
3,undistinguished,Blah. How in the world did this get 4.5 stars? Not well laid out which make it dense and difficult difficult to read. You can get better and of course fresher information searching the NYT. And no introduction of practical stuff - one of the only entries on crime is where one of the Bush twins had her pocketbook lifted. I lament the end of the great Access guides.
2,Kindle edition has useless maps,"I like the paper version of this guide, however the Kindle version is less usable as all maps are in such low resolution that names of streets and points of interests are unreadable."
3,Unbalanced reporting,"The trouble with travel books like Frommer's is that they don't tell the negative side as thoroughly as they do the positive. That's why I like Rick Steves' European guidebooks. He is opinionated and quick to tell both sides of the story.This Frommer's book on Buenos Aires was useful on our trip last week but did not discuss how massive and basically filthy and jammed with traffic the city is. The sidewalks were littered with broken pavement, garbage and dog droppings, even in the best of neighborhoods.In one section, Frommer's relates a day trip via ferry to nearby Uruguay; it made it sound as if one were visiting the Magic Kingdom. In truth, it was just a few streets and shops; certainly not worth the trouble.There was no warning about counterfeit Argentine currency. Apparently color laser printers are pretty common down there because there are plenty of homemade 20, 50 and 100 peso bills that look perfect to the untrained eye. A warning would have helped here."
3,"Ignore dining and hotel suggestions, great side trips","I never like dining suggestions in Frommer Travel Guides. The very best are expected, quality food at high prices. But their best values are usually not the best values in that respective city/country. What I did like from this book was the side trips, which I highly recommend. Particularly nice was my buquebus trip to Colonia, Uruguary. I went in the winter and it was very scenic and a nice contrast to Recoleta, the neighborhood where I ended up renting an apartment in Buenos Aires."
5,See You At The Top,Best all around book (besides the Bible) to transform your self-image and have a better life!
5,One of my heros.,I bought this copy for one of my employees. She has already used what it teaches to better her grandson.
5,A classic...,"The thing that's so likeable about this book compared to others available on the market, is the friendly conversational mannerin which it was written. Zig is no absolutist, his style ishumorous and low key - which is refreshing for a change. The book is filled with dozens of motivational stories guaranteed to lift ones spirit. I recommend it to all who can read, young and old. Perhaps the only flaw about this book which prevents it from becoming a true classic, is the fact that most of the stories come from the recommended reading section which is already of classical status. Secondly, the book never made it well as a paperback. This is probably because of the fact that it was too long and some parts even a bit too corny. But if you're looking for a neat little book that ties it all into one - this is it.It's a shame more people don't buy into Zig's philosphy's, if so,this would be a far better world indeed."
5,Great motivator by Zig,"I bought See You at The Top back in 1980. The advice is timeless; self image, goal setting and attitude. Zig is one of the best motivational authors out there. Also recommend Zig Ziglar on Selling and Zig Ziglars Secrets of Closing the Sale.I previewed Zigs autobiogrophy recently at a Book store and was wholly dissappointed with it. Great tribute to a great man for sure, but not totally factual and didn't do anything for me so I didn't buy it.See You at The Top and Secrets of Closing Sales are great reads and belong in every success/sales achievers personal library."
4,Enjoyable,"Great harmony, good singers, good words. What more do you want.My husband and father-in-law both have enjoyed it immensely."
5,Nice lighter,"Works as advertised, and nice quality. Seems very well built. I'd recommend buying this unit. Five more words seem to be required, so there."
4,Great lighter- but not low cost,"The lighter is very solidly built, and the flame is rock solid. The temperaure gauge sort of works, but that is a bit frivolous."
4,Most reliable flame,This works great for windy and cold conditions. Best lighter I've had. Thermometer is useless.
5,"Another Terrific Burt's Bees Product, Invigorating","I have used Cherry Chapstick for as long as I can remember, and I still love it, but I will now be periodically switching off with Beeswax Lip Balm. I didn't think anything could ever make me want to add variety to my Cherry Chapstick regimen, but I was wrong. Beeswax Lip Balm is minty and invigorating, and it feels nice. I have always loved beeswax candles. I now love this product as well. And it is nice that it is offered in a value pack.J.H. Sweet, author of The Fairy Chronicles, and Burt's Bees Enthusiast"
4,Major Label Debut not so Sour,"The Lemonheads got screwed. They got screwed by the media. They got screwed by the biz. They got screwed by the fickle public. When Evan Dando seized control of the group from former leader, Ben Deily, it gave him an opportunity to unleash some truly brilliant pop songs on the general public. The general public responded by only paying attention to their rocked out version of Mrs. Robinson. It was truly the public who missed out. If you love great song writing, pick up Lovey. This album is before the fuss. If you are not moved by the song ""Ride With Me"", I'm afraid you're dead inside. How many people in the history of Rock n' Roll have written a love song to a discarded kitchen stove? What is a better way to say goodbye to the listener than the closing song ""(The) Door""? The production value isn't as slick as their later releases, but the songs are understated monuments of pop brilliance."
3,Great Starter For Mellower Lemonheads Era,"It seems that Lemonheads fans are split into two categories: Pre-""Lovey"" and Post-""Lovey.""Pre-""Lovey"" had the band in a harder, more punkish style.Post-""Lovey"" had the band in a mellower, more melodic pop style.It was not until the following album, ""It's A Shame About Ray,"" that the band was pushed into headliner status. However, one can see that it was ""Lovey"" where the transition took place, bridging both eras. A little hard in some places (though not as hard as earlier stuff) and a little pop in other places.Whether you love the older or later versions of the band, ""Lovey"" is a good album, but, in my opinion, not as good as what was yet to come (as I am in the group that prefers the later Lemonheads)."
3,The best is yet to come.,"My first Lemonheads album, this was a taped copy now replaced by my cd. Evan lays the blueprints here for his later masterworks. This is a midpoint where he began to kick off his thrashy past and discover cool melodies.This cd is harder to love and contains many fewer standouts. Listening to this again I realise why I still had doubts about the band. Evan is still struggling to find his true voice and even the Fort Apache team can't produce a great product.If you came to this blind you would doubt what lay ahead. It contains a few pointers with his Gram Parson's cover and Juilanna on backing vocals on 1 song."
5,Great Read,You cannot go wrong with Alan Furst novels. I have read three of them in a very short period and they are all good. They are not as entertaining as Bernie Gunther stories but they have deeper plots. My only issue with all of Mr. Furst's novels so far is that there is a point in the middle of each book where it appears that he has lost his way and rambles for 20 pages. The story eventually gets back on track and you forget the minor problem with the story.
1,Kingdom of Shadows,"First, I enjoy the ""atmospheres"" created by Alan Furst in his books.Having said that, I wonder what the other people who reviewed this book are smoking.This book lacks coherence. I am a reasonably intelligent person, and I can find no theme or narrative thread to unify this book. It's just a bunch of disparate stories involving one man.When I was on the last page of the book, I had no idea I was near the end. I finished reading that page, and wondered, where is the rest of the story?The book leaves most of the stories in the book uncompleted.I wish I had the time to outline the stories in the book and show how many went nowhere or remained unfinished.I guess the strangest part of all this is that you can write a book like this and people will say, Hey, great job."
5,Rich details make this a winner,"This book is rich with detail, not just of sight and sound, but of the richness of life: music, books, conversation and politics. All this detail is seamlessly and unobtrusively added, bringing this historical espionage into a three-dimensional liveliness that makes it a standout novel.Morath is not your usual spy. In fact, he's not officially a spy. He's just doing a few favors and interestingly and realistically, not privy to the details -- so that the favors he performs aren't always exactly on point -- as far as what he thinks their purpose might be. This is the story of a man moving from casual engagement in a cause to making a decision to become an active player. It's not your typical, solve one dilemma and win the day story. It's about one man actually commiting himself -- and to what, that's for another book another day, or for you to decide."
3,Enjoyments and Reservations,"I read most novels purely for enjoyment, after my serious reading is finished, and that is how I approached Kingdom of Shadows. I heard Furst being interviewed on ""Fresh Air"" and he intrigued me. And I have enjoyed reading Kingdom of Shadows. But after reading the customer reviews posted here, I have a few comments. First, I'm an historian, and if the novel were set in the time and place of my expertise, and had the flaws ""A Reader"" noted, it would have disturbed me as it did that reviewer. Second, I do think these flaws should have been caught by an editor at the press, fluent in Hungarian and knowledgeable about Hungary, whose job it should be to catch errors. Third, customer reviews are invaluable because they increasingly influence customer choices, and surely publishers --and authors --will pay attention when their carelessness is revealed."
5,Furst Writes The Best WWII Novels. Period.,"While Kingdom of Shadows may be half a notch below Furst's best work (The World At Night, Dark Star), it is still a superior story, wonderfully told, with a subtlety other reviewers may confuse for meandering.The book may seem slightly off from his best because it is in feeling and in time like so many of his other novels; however, the story is enough different and these new characters enough in their own worlds that it remains compelling.Furst captures the horror and wonder of ordinary people caught up in extraordinary events, and their reaction to a world truly turned upside down. His attention to detail and history create a spirit of the time that makes it feel like you're there.Truly another remarkable novel."
2,over rated,"Having read the review of this book in the NY Times, I had to read it. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. The charachters especially Nicholas Morath aren't that well developed. There is a certain pretentiousness in this story, especially for someone familiar with the setting and the history of pre-war europe. It is difficult to empathize with the characters because they are all so superficial. The subject matter is interesting in general and the story holds the attention but I began losing my patience with the lack of literary style. I read to the end just to see what happens! The reader would be better served by reading Sándor Márai, Sóma Morgenstern, Joseph Roth etc."
2,Not Furst's best work,"This one is a far cry from Furst's earlier works. Very little in the way of a plot, and even that is pretty thin. It seems to have no beginning, middle or end, or any real defining climax. I read this one out of principle, as other books by Furst have been immensely satisfying (particularly Dark Star, Night Soldiers)."
4,Gets the Job Done,"I love my Crock Pot. The only problems with this model are that the high setting is pretty hot-which can be good if you want to cook things quickly, but if you leave it on all day, I would recommend using the low setting, even if the recipe calls for the high setting. It also has a tendency to rattle if moisture gets stuck between the lid and the pot(especially when using the high setting). Not having a timer hasn't been a problem; I will just leave it on the low setting, and I am usually gone for at least 8 hours. Overall, the size has been perfect for making meals for my husband and me without having too many leftovers. Great for stews and soups that can simmer all day."
5,Great Book,"This book was very informative, but was able to avoid the dryness that weighs down many otherwise interesting history books. Most likely, it has to do with the fact that this book is a condensation of two normally separate volumes. Highly recommended."
5,Experience Victory Thorugh Christ!,"Thomas' wonderful title is an excellent encouragement to live a life of victory instead of defeat.Among the important points Thomas covers include:1. Having a new life in Christ saves us from the futility of self-effort.2. To be a true disciple, we must realize our own bankruptcy.3. We are called to commit to Christ, not a cause.4. What is not of faith is sin.5. Do not panic and let God be God!6. The sufficiency of Christ.7. Remember the sin of Moses that kept him out of the Promised Land.8. God does not intend to satisfy us in the wilderness.Read and be encouraged to stop trying to live life in your own strength and instead let Christ's life flow through you!"
5,Inspirational,"Thomas has a unique view of how Christ will live in us if we only give Him an invitation. If we do this without reservation, Christ will then take over our lives while we are allowed to go on vacation. Anytime I read a book by Thomas, I invariably feel inspired."
2,"Cute, but Poor Material - BREAKS VERY EASILY","We purchased two of these for our twin 3-year olds. The product idea is fun, but the material used to construct these is completely inappropriate for a product made for children. It breaks very easily under normal children's use, which includes occasionally falling from a low (20"" high) child's table. Broken edges can also be a little sharp.You can see a photo of ours after a few weeks of use atwww dot dbooth dot org slash 2007 slash"
5,"An informative, precise, quick read","""Bass Fishing Facts"" (an anglers guide to bass lifestyles and behaviors) is a quick and informative read. Larry Larsen gets right down to the basics with few frills. He discusses the various senses and physical attributes of the largemouth bass. How, why, and when a bass feeds, strikes, and reproduces are all carefully explained. Techniques to employ to catch a bass when he is most likely to strike are clearly illustrated and annotated for both lakes and streams. Bass habitats and staging areas are revealed so the angler can fish the most likely spots. Later chapters feature specific techniques and locations for areas of the South from Florida to Texas. This book is number six in a series of nine that Larry has written featuring bass and bass fishing."
1,Worse than cardboard.,"These speakers are junk. I replaced the original equipment with these, and was roundly disappointed. They are sitting on the garage floor waiting for a trip to the dump."
5,Life in the time of the Tudors,"While not 100 percent historically accurate The Tudors does a good job at telling what life was like in the court of Henry VIII played brilliantly by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers.The story starts several years after Henry becomes King and goes through everything from the Field of Cloth and Gold, the various plots against the French and Spanish, the birth of Henry Fitzroy (the Kings illegitimate son) and much more.Most of the story centers on Henry's marriage to Catherine of Aragon and his increasing love affair with Anne Boleyn and which led him to cast Catherine off and break with the Church of Rome to marry Anne.The cast is very good. And while it is not 100 percent accurate the acting, scenery, and costumes make up for it."
4,Great DVD,"Heard about The Tudors through friends, but sadly don't have Showtime. So, I ordered the first season DVD and am extremely happy with the purchase! Highly recommend!"
4,Great Fun,The Tudors is great fun. It is an entertaining soap opera-just don't expect it to be historically accurate.
2,send the script writer home,"having gone to some trouble and expense to provide period costuming etc., they have the characters speaking 21st century english (complete with americanisms). what with their talk of summit meetings etc., I expected them to discuss deployment of nuclear warheads. also the gratuitous sex was entirely unnecessary (thus is serious drama reduced to soft porn). There are several good tudor dramatisations out there, don't waste your money on this one.Anne of the Thousand Days / Mary, Queen of ScotsA Man for All SeasonsThe Six Wives of Henry VIII - Complete SetElizabeth RMasterpiece Theatre: Elizabeth I - The Virgin Queen"
1,NOT HISTORICALLY ACCURATE IN THE LEAST!,"I've always LOVED the tudors. I know every detail about the Tudor family and can pretty much teach a class on them. So I was really excited about this show!! But alas, my expectations proved futile. It is nicely filmed, but sooo inaccurate!"
5,This is a great show!,This show is hard to stop watching! Jonathan Rhys Meyers is incredible. The woman who plays the queen is great too! A must see for sure!
4,Good historical drama,"This series appeals to an Anglophile and history buff. Not perfectly accurate to the history, but pretty close. Gorgeous settings, good casting, good acting, especially Sam Neill as Cardinal Wolsey and Nick Dunning as Thomas Boleyn. Johnathan Rhys Myers is doing very well as the young Henry; I'll be interested to see how he ages. Queen Catherine of Aragon is a more sympathetic figure than I'd imagined. I've only watched a couple of episodes, but look forward to rest."
4,it was one of my favorite shows.,"i was glad to see the story unfold in this way, it was very true to the real thing i think."
5,Great to have,I am enjoying all over again the first season of The Tudors. I had missed some episodes and found it great to see it in its entirety and know I will look forward to year two. I really found the cast and story to be great as well as the video which was of very good quality. It also allows the viewer to let the story become an integral part of the viewing.Ruthie DK
2,"Few features, no commentary, and DRM makes this a dissapointing set","I was hoping for some great commentary, what decisions they made, when and why they differed from history, the costumes and scenery. Instead only a 3 extremely short features are on the final disc, along with advertising for other Showtime series. Finally, the information on each disc about which episodes are on which discs is incorrect!Not only that but these discs featured DRM, so I could not play them on my laptop when travelling, I could only play them on a windows Vista machine that I happen to have an HDMI compliant videocard and monitor. But it would not play on any XP machine.All in all, an extremely poor set created for a tv series that I enjoyed."
4,Why Can't I Buy This Directly From Amazon?,"It may not be the best way to learn about history, but it was still 'pretty' to watch (even a little m/m kissing added in). I thoroughly enjoyed it and don't understand why I can't just buy it directly from Amazon instead of having to go to The Marketplace. Older DVDs I can understand, but why this one?"
4,Faboulous!,"This is a Historical Novel/Mini-Series, never meant to be a factually accurate. It's rich in costume detail, locations, stunning photography, makeup and many period antiques, but they took liberties with the chronology, dialog, cheezy Computer Graphics and a few facts!Who cares. It reaches out and grabs your attention - it's hard to walk away from the scenes and scenery. You can look up the facts on your computer, while you watch the shows again and again. It's fun to find the flows and oversights, and I was anything but offended with the lack of accuracy. The passion, the impressions, and the impact are accurate enough.The real King Henry was a repulsive and disgusting, and the on-going plague was unimaginable to most of us (those who haven't been to a 3rd world country, that is).I gotta get some of that Bling, too!"
3,Is only first episode of each season available?,"If so, I must be too used to Netflix streaming providing a whole season of any given series. It is deceptive to not state what is being provided at the outset."
1,not very happy,"I ordered the complete first series of the Tudors, and I only received discs 3 and 4. It said that I was to be getting the complete first season and it's not like you can watch it starting from disc 3! I'm very disappointed."
