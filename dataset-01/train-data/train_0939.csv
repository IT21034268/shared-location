4,a wide range of logos,"a better collection than the first (los logos - which had many pages filled with 'trendy now, crap later' no-longevity logos. this book has a nice wide range to suit many styles. the book itself is well made and is an almost must-have for the library."
4,Dos Logos,"lots of fresh new, creative logos, well catagorized. I belive there is a First one called Los Logos. And if I'm not mistaken there is also a thrid, i'm guessing it's called Tres Logos."
5,air filters,Filters were exactly as described and one month later seem to work as well as if not better than the 3M filters we had previously. Definitely will buy again.
3,It's...fine,"Maybe my expectations were too high since this probably isn't a super-duper top-of-the-line quality knife, but it was still a substantial investment for me and I'm not exactly wowed. The knife did not arrive very sharp, and while I have been able to get a decent edge on it with my whetting steel, it doesn't hold its edge much better than the cheapo department store brand knife I had before. Unless I whet the blade before every use I still get some resistance from vegetables with skins (such as tomatoes and peppers), and cutting raw meat off the bone or the skin off a fish is still frustrating (I know this isn't exactly the right knife for it, and my still-rudimentary skills don't help matters, but it still seems like the blade should slide through the meat more easily than it does).This knife gets the job done but I'm not convinced it's truly worth the price."
2,Henckels Twin Pro S-8-Inch Chef's Knife w/Hollow Edge,The knife is constructed well - as pictured - does not cut very well. It just was not very sharp. I tried mincing some vegetables - it just didn't work as well as my $9.99 serrated TV info knife. I was disappointed.
1,Choose Another,"There are many wonderful and interesting books on Marilyn Monroe out there,including in ( ),so why pick this one?It is not particularly good at all.It talks about Marilyn's many relationships,affairs,marriages and stripping in a bar for 20 dollars.There is not much of interest and even the writing is not particularly fantastic.I read it because I like marilyn,but really this one is just pages of uninteresting drivel."
4,The customer service was good.,Unfortunately when I received the book I opened it and the pages fell out. I notified the seller and they said they order them from the publisher and sometimes they aren't up to their own standards. They offered to send a new book at no charge.
3,Less yapping and more jumping.,"I don't know jack about Evel Kinevel, so I can't vouch for the accuracy of the story told here, but if Evel was a hard drinkin', hard womanizin' donkeyhole who enjoyed urinating outside and jumping large objects with his motorcycle then I'd say it was pretty accurate.The story aspect was alright but the jump stuff was barely even touched on. I'd much rather more time was spent on him jumping buses than him arguing with his wife. Who cares? Just jump something! I'd been better off renting a DVD with just jumps on it.Also I was very upset at the minor role given to Lance Henriksen."
1,Evel Knievel deserved better then this flop.,This movie was on TNT and the dvd will not make it any better. This might be worse then Viva Knievel from 1977. While I thought George Eads was a good choice I didn't think so after watching it. The book by Steve Mandich was great and very accurate but the movie suffers from a poor script . You never find out why Evel started to jump for a living. They never show the showman part of Evel. Instead they show really stupid things like Evel going to the bathroom twice in the movie.
4,Good movie,"When I first watched the broadcast premiere of this movie I thought it was good -- not great -- but good. I thought George Eads did a great job as Evel.Then this DVD came out and being a George Eads fan, I bought it and glad I did.The commentary that George Eads and John Badham do in this DVD adds a whole new insight into the filming and what went into making this film. They take you through scene after scene and what was going on to make the scene credible and Eads does a wonderful job of describing what mind set he was in while filming a particular scene.It added a fresh perspective when watching the movie again and I found I enjoyed it much more this time around.The commentary alone is worth the price of the movie.A must for any George Eads fan."
5,Evel Knievel......,"I had the priviledge of growing up during the time that Evel Knievel soared high during his many death-defying jumps. I must admit, he was my idol back then. To this day, I'm still in awe of all the things he did. While I liked the movie(and think you will to), which stars George Eads(of CSI)playing the title role, I was expecting more about his life. To me, it seemed more like a remake of the 70's ""Evel Knievel"" film which starred George Hamilton. Not that it's a bad thing as that movie was pretty good. It's just I expected more about his life and his family than just the highlights of his career.However,John Badham (of Saturday Night Fever fame) did an outstanding job directing this movie. George Eads played a convincing Evel, as well.All in all, though, the movie is pretty good. Inspiring, to say the least. I really liked it and I think you will, too."
4,Classic Frugal Gourmet,"This is Classic Jeff Smith. If you were a fan of the Frugal Gourmet series you will love this. He cooks like real people. This is ""real-time"" cooking. He chops his own ingredients and chats with the viewer like a friend. He interjects great anecdotes along with his recipies. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is that most people who live with the heavily edited, pre-measured, multi-angle cooking shows from the modern cable networks may feel this show to be amaturish. But if, like me, you learned how to make gravy with Graham Kerr or Julia Childs, this is classic cooking of dishes real people will cook and eat. I will buy other Frugal Gourmet video sets as I can find them"
1,Not the polished studio versions you're used to hearing,"A collection in two CDs of the worse examples of live performances that illustrate the vast differences between really rough live performances and the groomed polished studio versions that we're used to hearing. I listened to the first two cuts, sampled the rest, and threw the CDs away."
5,Great Boxing DVDs for beginners and advanced boxers,I finished 7 of those DVDS and one more to go.. they are great.. nothing is better.. I tried so many and browsed a lot on YouTube but Chris is a super trainer and I wish I can go to his gym one day..
1,"Short Intro? No, long criticism!","This essay is more about Roger Scruton's ideas about Spinoza's philosophy that about Spinoza's philosophy itself. He spends too much of this short book on criticism of Spinoza's geometric method of presentation and hardly any on his vision.Typically he says on the last page of the book that ""it is no accident that Spinoza should have called forth so sharp an attack from the other false prophet of atheism, Nietzsche,"" and concludes with a quote from Nietzsche.If Scruton considers Spinoza a ""false prophet of atheism"" he has self-confessed an ignorance of Spinoza's work."
2,"Not Helpful, A Least to This Novice","Got this as a preliminary guide to Spinoza to supplement ""A Book Forged in Hell"". Some of it was useful, but a good deal seemed to me to wander into incomprehensible discussion of philosophical issues. The problem may be mine, since I have never studied philosophy in an organized way. As an introduction, however, this is way too complex. ""Forged In Hell"" is far more accessible, and taught me much more about Spinoza's thought."
4,exciting!,"a dizzying blend of angular rock, electronic tomfoolery, and psychadelic dealings galore. things take a very interesting turn within these 3 songs. beginning with a faint blip that echoes some old Pink Floyd material, the first cut explodes with a calculated fury that is both primal and highly intelligent. the second song has a bit of a dubby structure and is a highly effective and powerful piece of music. the final track is a nice ep closer that has a sustained electronic ending that leaves the listener wanting more and more. a nice teaser for their epic De-loused album."
5,Tremulant,"I listened to the 20 or so minutes contained on this CD, and wondered why I ever bothered spending so much money on other EPs and LPs...Quite simply this is some of the best music I have ever heard and, (whisper this quietly), could even have dislodged all my At the Drive-in CDs put together as #1 in my heart.But enough from me... go order this right away if you still haven't - you still have some time before the LP is released."
3,Unsure lure,More an impressive sampler to grow potential fan's appetites for what was to be the debut deal-sealer than a meaningful recording.
3,It's ATDI all over again...,"In my opinion ATDRI was Cedric (and quite possibly the other guy with the afro - he seems to have gotten it right with crime in choir). Without his vocals ATDRI would have been just another band. So whenever someone says ""boy, I'm sure bummed that they broke up,"" tell them to go listen to The Mars Volta. MV continues with some of the same type of beat Vaya had - spacey, intense, tribal rock stuff...the peak of ATDR.The only major difference between the two bands is that Cedric doesn't scream. However, give MV enough time and I think he'll be freaking out in no time flat - sort of like how Crooked Fingers started out as a solo act and evolved into a full blown rock-out band. Hopefully, by the time MV releases an LP or two, ATDRI will be completely reincarnated, without the guys from Sparta dampening the real talent.Buy Tremulant, it's good music."
1,...,"I haven't listened to the CD, and maybe I'm biased, but these guys [are not good]. I saw them opening for the Chili Peppers, and I couldn't tell the difference between any of the songs. They all ran together. And you can't understand what he's saying, the beats are all the same, and it just seems like they're another garage band except they don't know how to vary their music. The crowd at the concert was gettin [upset] bc they were so bad. And then the singer tried to be all hardcore by throwing the cymbal on the ground..."
5,Better than Tool???...,"It feels sacreligious to say it, but I would trade most of my favorite bands to perpetuate Mars Volta. This band is a racy mix of Jazz, Metal pop rock and 70's rock. They craft classic riffs but transform the average into art with their jazz improvs. This is the serious fan's band!"
5,Seriously the greatest cd I have ever listened to.,"There's not much to say except that everyone should own this cd no matter what type of music they like, although you can hear influences from the 70's and obviously influences from today's indie bands, this music is wholly different. I am in love with these 3 songs and 2 other demo songs that are floating around the internet. The lyrics, vocal melodies, guitar work, and especially the drums are amazing. Music fans searching for innovation look no further. The Mars Volta will probably take over the world with their full length now that they are signed to a major label. Please listen to this cd, and download the songs Cicatriz and Roulette Dares."
4,Just the Beggining,"This is The Mars Volta's first jolt into the music scene. I'm glad to say it's only the beggining; a look at what's to come. They definatley proved themselves to me as one of the top bands on my list, accompanied by the likes of Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin. Simply put, a Great Band!!! De-Loused was great and I can't wait for Frances the Mute....in stores March 1st!----ViTo----"
5,Good Stuff,"This is 20 min. of great music. I just wanted to ask jordan if he even knows about at the drive in, or how long they were together, and how their performances were hardcore. and i really doubt it was mars volta that got the crowd upset. If it was, it's because of a bunch of stupid yuppies paying just to see the chilipeppers."
3,not as good as deloused,"I love Deloused; it's one of my favorite albums of all time. So, craving more, I went back and got Tremulant, and all in all I'm a bit disappointed. ""Eunuch Provocateur"" is a pretty cool, long, jam-type song, and ""Concertina"" is solid and a little on the mellower side. ""Cut That City"" will be instantly recognizable to anyone who has Deloused--it was redone and expanded into the outstanding ""Cicatriz e.s.p."" It's a good thing, too; that song is a very large improvement over ""Cut"", which I do not really like. All in all it's just not up to the admittedly high bar set by Deloused, but if you really need more Mars Volta and don't mind shelling out 7 or 8 bucks for a few more or less average songs..."
4,Needs subtitles,"This DVD would be great if it were re-issued with subtitles--the instructor, though very thorough, is difficult to understand at times.Also, it would not play in a computer, which is a negative if you are traveling and don't have access to a standard DVD player."
1,Disappontied,"I received the DVD in good Time. The DVD did not play in any of my DVD players. My PC saw the disk as a data disk but was unable to open the files. The sellers web site said I had to fill out a Return Authorization form and send it back with the defective disk. I have to pay return shipping. The process is too complicated for me, it would be better if I were able to speak to a coustomer service rep. So all in all I paid for a lesson in buyer beware"
1,Does not fit ML55 brake pads,"I ordered this unit for my ML55 W163, alas it didnt fit. This unit does not fit the ML55 brake pads, so be wary when buying it!"
4,Detangles without leaving a residue,"Suave Detangler Spray works well on my 5 year old daughter, whose hair is fine, slightly wavy and matts easily. I normally bathe her at night because it's easier to get going in the morning, but then her head is a mess. So, I spray this on and use my Remington Detangler (an electric comb especially made for detangling hair) and her hair detangles much more quickly and easily. It doesn't leave a film on my daughter's hair, so if I fail to wash it the next day, her hair still looks clean. Build-up can be a problem with some detanglers, but not for Suave.Suave Detangler Spray has a refreshing green apple scent that my daughter loves. When I spray her hair, it gets on her arm and she makes me smell how good her arm is. The scent stays in her hair even after it's dry. I have to admit, I like the scent of her hair when we cuddle."
2,Not great for my daughter's hair type...or my nose type,"My little girl is two. She has fine, but pretty wavy hair and it appears that it'll grown in very curly when she gets older (like her father). Though it hasn't grown in fully yet, I decided to hunt for a good detangler now to prevent nightmarish experiences with brushing hair later.Suave For Kids Awesome Apple Detangler does seem to make my daughter's hair easier to brush, but that's about it. Even the tiniest amount makes her normally shiny hair look dull and flat. The smell seems okay at first (like green apple flavored gum), but then has an after-scent of cheap hairspray that makes me feel a little sick if I smell it too long (can't imagine how gross it could be for her if she has my nose :) ). It may not impact everyone that way, but if you have a kid with fine hair and/or you or your child have a sensitive nose, keep looking."
3,It works.,"Being an adult and using this in a pinch,it works. Nice slip and nice smell, if you're a apple lover!"
1,LEAVES RESIDUE GREASY AND DOESNT WORK,"SOMETIMES WHEN I SEE POSITIVE REVIEWS I THINK THAT IT IS EMPLYEES OF THE PRODUCT COMPANY. THIS STUFF ABSOULTELY DOES LEAVE A GREASY RESIDUE IF USED MORE THAN ONCE. ALSO, DOESNT DETANGLE AS WELL AS OTHER THE UPSIDE IS THAT ITS CHEAP I BUY IT AT THE 99CENT STORE"
5,Certainly his best,This is his best album. A couple of the others are good but this one is great. If you are looking for an album/singer that is not listed at the top but should be... this is the one!HMJ3
3,Grub,What do you expect from a low budget B movie. That is what you get. It is a good story and fun to watch.
5,"Powerful, soulful music","This inspired and beautiful CD has a mesmerizing and trascendent quality, consistent with Rumi's writings. There is an immediacy to Mirabai's singing that is both palpable and stirring. She digs way down deep to draw out what she does. I find myself playing it over and over, hearing new elements each time in her delivery and in the jazzy, percussive music played by outstanding artists."
5,I have had quiet ears running down my cheeks on my way to,"work listening to ""this we are now"". What a wonderful feeling this is. Melt down and openning of the heart.A dear friend taught us this song on our pilgrimage in the Sahara desert but listening to it in all its glory with the womens' multilayered voices, strong and ecstatic, brought tears to my eyes. I do not exaggerate, I was ready to die that moment. It was perfect.All the songs are truly inspired and I'd like to meet the creator of such emotions. Thank you Mirabai!"
5,Perfect for all skill levels,"Gives a good history and good strategy. Covers word placement, arrangement, 2 letter word vocab, and has slightly dorky humor. Great book"
5,In celebration of the mad-cap,"This movie has a spirit of it's own and takes you on a roller-coaster ride of the visual - not only from the inventive camera trickery, but also through the breathtaking photography of Paris in the summer. It's the equivalent of a good French meal - lots of colour and taste, with a few suprises mixed in and a little difficult to comprehend.Zazie, the precocious urchin of the movie steals the show. Her zany antics and profanities keep the pace of the movie going. 44 years on, I wonder what happened to Catherine Demongeot who played the part?This movie is Eurpoean cinema at its best, and a magical celebration at that - full or double-entendre and presented in a way that says "" I don't care if the critics and focus groups don't like it - I'm just going to to what the hell I want, create havock, and have fun doing it!!"""
5,Human Cartoon,"This movie is absolutely fantastic. Louis Malle's early work was influenced by surrealism and absurdity. ""Zazie"" plays like a cartoon. An apprecation for French film is necessary, however, and an affinity and basic understanding of the language, as well.Films like this are not made any more. It has the mood of a time forgotten. Mod styles abound, it is a romp through Paris led by a hyperactive little girl and a host of wacky characters she encounters along the way: the nonchalant cab driver, the villain who accosts her, the ultra hip aunt, etc. The humor is playful and innocent for the most part, yet still manages to be side-splitting because of the unexpectedness. It is clever and inventive and truly a forgotten gem.Be aware that Hollywood has no hold what so ever on this film. It was crafted with utmost care and was really quite a special effects masterpiece for its time. I surely hope it is re-released soon!"
1,Quel Horreur!,"Total flop. Malle has ruined one of the funniest books ever written. Trust me, young friends: read the book instead of trying to watch this botchery. One of the worst Louis Malle films ever -what was he thinking? How can one ruin a book with such hilarious burlesque sujet, characters, dialogue (reads like a film script) and, best, that distilled essence of the 50's Paris..."
3,Help!,"I saw this movie and hated it, however, I saw an exceedingly deteriorated film print, with sound you could barely hear and subtitles out of focus, in an auditorium with acoustics like a parking garage. Someone tell me what's good about this film, and I'll rent it and try again."
5,"started slow, but ended with a bang!","I originally got this book based on reviews. It took me a long time to pick it up and start (I actually started it twice). But about 1/3 of the way through I was totally hooked. It still took me a while to finish, but that was because life and sleep got in the way :) I won't give away any of the plot, but the writing is absolutely beautiful. The imagery was amazing and I highly recommend picking up this book and getting through it."
1,It Stunk,"My book club read this one and it was pretty much unanimous - Loved it!Then there was me. I thought it was ridiculous. why? All the characters were straight from Mary Poppins or the latest Danielle Steel novel. Sheesh! I kept seeing myself reading this book and I never once felt that it could possibly be real. I felt detached and annoyed by every paragraph. Like this boyfriend, Troy, would exist in real life. Like a woman would sit in the bathroom, sober, and bawl her eyes out. Like a rich woman would spend her days dusting her figurines. Yet, of course, we're supposed to feel they're all ""normal"" -- just a bit, well, odd. The only thing odd is that people actually consider this to be a compelling story. On the contrary, it reads like the author made it up as she was going along."
3,"Pretty good, kept my attention","For the most part I liked this book. The characters were endearing and it had that quality that keeps you wanting to know what's going to happen next. And some of the things that were built up with anticipation didn't happen the way you expected, which helped the book feel real and hilighted the theme of ""don't wait until it's too late"". My only complaint is that the climax descended into a little bit of self-indulgent cheesiness. Although it did bring a tear to my eye on the NY subway, it was a velveta tear. But then again, my boyfriend says I am never satisfied with the endings of books and movies, so maybe I just expect too much. Overall a good read and I would recommend it to all but the most discriminating and/or jaded readers."
2,I Expected More,"This book was referred to me by someone who had also read The Kite Runner. She told me that if I loved The Kite Runner, I'd love this book too. Because The Kite Runner is my favorite book of all time, I was very excited to read this book. I was not impressed. I expected way more than I got. I trudged through this book sometimes putting it down for a few days at a time. Usuallly, when I like a book, I cannot put it down. I found the characters a little too quirky and couldn't get into them much. I was happy to finally finish the book - then I totally forgot about it. If a book is really good, then it stays on my mind for days after reading it. Most books I read are passed through a circle of friends - this one went straight to the Public Library donation center. I'm sure someone will enjoy it. Afterall, I have read books myself that others have totally hated. However, I found the cover of this book totally intriguing!"
1,Could have been great,"This book had the potential to be a wonderful book, with engaging characters, and conflicts that most people could relate to. What spoiled it for me was the generous use of profanity and filthy language. The attitude the author and the characters have toward the ""marital embrace"" has nothing to do with marriage at all. She treats sexuality with a very offensive courseness. Minus the gutter language and a barn yard approach to intimacy, I might have liked this book."
4,Excellent writing.,The book has excellent writing - as good as anything you will ever read. I especially liked the dream sequences and flashback character development sections. The plot itself requires some suspension of belief and eventually seems contrived as the coincidences pile up. Overall a very good read.
5,Lots of wonderful characters,This novel twists and turns around until you are caught up in each of the wonderful character's unique stories. You will celebrate and mourn with every page turn.
2,Good until it tries to make sense,"This book is a lively emotional exploration of simple metaphor. Broken people, expensive china that cannot break. Broken lives, the joy of breaking things and reconstructing them. The first few chapters are exceptional and, despite their hackneyed premise, drew me into these characters and their adventure. At that point, the author should have stopped and made this a simple exploration of real life, etc. Instead, she gets symbolic and emotional and waxes into ""big issues,"" at which point this book becomes as predictable as a heat wave and about as exciting. Kallos is talented and while this book is of the lukewarm modern popular fiction ""literature"" (not literature) variety, it had promise for the first half. Stop reading there and you'll get a flavorful shot of life with funny, literate, lively text."
2,and now a warning,"If you like good fiction maybe you should wait for the author's next book. This book begins promisingly but becomes increasingly absurd. Tiresome by the middle, irritating by the end, very hard to finish(club pick). It is well-written and VERY ambitious but the book's real relationships (father/daughter, owner/objects, jilted lovers, guilt/retribution for a few)are mainly resolved so poorly that I would warn serious readers off this one.The author's Big Themes keep piling up. Many bad fiction cliches including insta-friends, saintly boyfriends, ghosts."
2,Rave reviews for this book are puzzling,"I had great hopes for ""Broken for You,"" my book club's choice. The beginning, although a little slow, was very well written. By the middle of the book I was having to force myself to read it (Life being short). Book Club members kept assuring me the last part was the best. Unless my copy was missing a chapter, they were wrong.I whole heartedly agree with the folks that said it reminded them of a Hallmark movie. Everybody's quirky & no loose ends. The dime store philosophy was forced & obviously cut & pasted towards the end.Lots better books out there but the author does have some writing potential."
3,"Alright, I guess","First of all this is not my kind of book so I don't want to be too tough,The beginning of the book was good, Margaret and Wonda were interesting characters. Towards the middle there were too many characters--dull to say the least--and i thought other than Wanda they had no purpose in the story. Such a dramatic action --breaking the Halocoust treasures I found inane. I was waiting for a stronger climax that would enlighten me as a private aha to the deliberate breakage of the items robbed from the victims of such an atrocity years ago. Broken pieces as the members of the house, or was it the victims themselves, well that wasn't strong enough for me.Also, the book could have been shorter--the extra characters were fullersfor the original story line. Margaret and Wonda, who were lonely and broken individuals and the story begins----"
3,"Not as good as I was hoping, but not bad.","This book had a VERY slow start. I did not start finding it very interesting until I got through almost 200 pages! The end was FANTASTIC! All but two of the people who belong to my book club, finished it. They could not get through all the details. The story really does blossom into something interesting later. I was proud that I finished it. I would not read it again. It is also a very unrealistic story. The details in the book are a little to ironic."
3,All the Pieces ...,"OK-this book had good character development and interesting twists and turns, but you could see the ending way, way, way off, so the end of the book was more of a relief than a revelation. I kind of like things the other way around."
1,Irresponsible Portrayal of Astrocytoma,"Because my own sister died with an astrocytoma tumor, I'm incensed with this author's syrupy portrayal of Margaret's illness and her peaceful departure. Astrocytoma is a debilitating tumor ending in a horrific death. Kallas' research limited itself to the symbolism that a star-shaped tumor provided her story.Margaret's character is shallow. The story is contrived. Wanda ""pops"" something into her mouth or puts on her ""f**k me pumps"" one too many times. Irritating read."
4,Different in a good way,"This is a different book in terms of storyline and development. It took some getting used to at first but after getting to know the characters, it makes you want to read more and more. Just sit back and enjoy it!"
3,better than metal,"THese are not as sturdy as an older product they made, but still better than the metal ones. It lasts forever and the cleanup is easy. I love to paint rooms and have had mine for many years and they still look great. Too bad this plastic is thinner than the older product."
5,Finally found it!,"I have been looking high and low for this bit after chipping the phillips head a coupel of years ago. I really like this tool, but hated to buy a whole new one just because of one chipped bit. I had the worst time finding one and all but given up. This was much less than a new screw driver."
3,High Price,"While Klein makes good tools, they do not make great ones. This is only two replacement bits (not the whole set of 10) and it's too high for not enough."
3,"Not horrible, but get the island-specific version instead","This book was all right. The intro general-info pages are really detailed (info for traveling with kids, international visitors, senior travelers, transportation options, etc.). However, there are scant few photos -- just a couple of pages' worth stuck in the middle, and they're more landscape-oriented than tourism-oriented, so they really aren't relevant to a guidebook.There's some good information in there, but if you know what island you're going to already, then get a book about that particular island; otherwise you have to wade through a bunch of stuff that isn't relevant to your trip. For instance, I found the Hidden Maui guidebook to be much more helpful for the trip we'll be taking."
4,Krytponite U Lock LONG w/ bracket,"Overall, good lock for medium theft areas. I'd still get a chain lock in addition to this lock if I were going into high-theft areas. The key can be kinda tricky if not inserted properly into the slit (chance it may break); hasn't happened yet though.Overall not a bad lock for the price I paid."
2,Works but the mount is really poor,"The lock itself works as expected but the EZ Mount is not ""EZ"" at all. Removing it is a pain (that is if you manage to get it off without breaking it). It also keeps the lock kind of far (about half an inch or so) from the bike, which will be very inconvenient depending on where you install it. I returned it and will look for a model with a better mount."
5,It works,"Had this for several years. I have a large hybrid bike and life in an area with proper inverted U bike racks. This lock works very well going from front wheel, around inverted U, and onto the frame. Yes, its a long narrow lock - if you are going to lock to other things like parking meters, you might want a different model, one that is wider. The key works just fine (try WD40 if it sticks). The mounting bracket... really??? I have owned kryptonite locks all my life and never once used the mounting bracket. As someone noted, this model is significantly lighter than the more secure NYC model U locks; if you are carrying the lock all the time, that can be a factor.Good standard lock. If you need more security, get a more expensive model but it will be heavier. Consider, if you are commuter, buying two locks - one for at home, one for at work - and just not carrying the thing."
5,love this!,"very relaxing. I'm not a granola type, but those affirmation are really nice... Some of them made me cry, and them calmed me down! Yes, I'd def recommend it!"
3,not as effective as I thought it would be,"This cd was relaxing, but it did not get me ready for childbirth. I guess you need to be more into holistic music."
2,Disappointed,"Apparently I didn't pay such close attention when I bought this CD. Most of the CD is talking you through calming strategies for visualization. I thought it was classical music for the baby. There are only 4 songs that are without voice. Thoroughly disappointed but I'm sure it's my fault for not checking into this CD further. So if you want someone to talk to you this is the CD for you, if you just want the musical version this is not for you."
2,I could not relax or meditate to this CD,"I bought this CD based on other reviews. I must admit I am a bit particular when it comes to meditative CD's as certain voices can get on my nerve. This woman had a calm voice but her meditations were super cheesy. I just could not get into it. She would say things like ""you and your child are one with the earth"", etc. I could not help but laugh."

4,Great Read!,"F. Paul Wilson is awesome! Ever since reading the Tomb, I've alwaysliked Repairman Jack. He is the anti-hero that you can't help toadmire and to cheer for.I bought the Kindle eBook version from Amazon and had a really greattime with the book.Now, I'm planning on reading all the Repairman Jack books on myiPhone Kindle app :-)"
5,More Jack,"Repairman Jack is back and in action again. This time we get to meet his sister and through her, learn more about Jack's background and history. A very good story in a very good series that will kepp the reader on the edge of her/his seat!"
5,Best In Series?,"After a subpar outing in Conspiracies, Repairman Jack returns to form in HOSTS, the 5th in the series. This book gets off to a frenzied start as a subway is taken over by a crazed gunman, and Jack is forced to act openly in order to save his life and that of the other riders. From there, surprise after suprise await Jack as his path crosses with his sister, and some old enemies from previous books.The action and situations that Wilson presents us with in this book are top notch, and, with the exception of one 20-page long dream sequence, never falters.Kudos to Mr. Wilson for delivering such a satisfying book!"
3,Sad...(Sniff).,I found All the Rage's plot a little annoying; yet the characters and circumstances were so up beat and dynamic who could fill to enjoy the book? Hosts though...Seemed to be a repetition of many of the major plot points of All the Rage worse it didn't have the dynamics. I never thought I'd give a Repairman Jack book three stars; but with great reluctance...I do.
4,Not as funny as one wd think from the title,"Sellar and Yeats (failed Oxon) wrote ""1066 And All that"" the standard by which all historical parodies and satires are measured.This work uses the title but none of the wit of the orignal and so sets up the knowledgeable reader, expecting a humorous look at history, for a fall.This is not to say that the history relayed in this book is wrong or poorly written. On the contrary, it's peachy. But it's too straight-forward for the title. Readers will learn a great deal, and an honest appraisal of the Catholic Church's true history, not the gunk that passes for such as found in most elementary-junior high and high schools, not to mention too many college- and university courses."
5,Hurray! I found it!!,I always find something I like and then it's discontinued so I was very happy to find Gingerlily by Healing Garden!! Thanks sooo much!
5,Subtle and sexy,"This is my favorite scent. It is a warm scent, mixes well with your own body scent to create a unique, mature scent which isn't overly musky or flowery. I prefer it over famous designer scents because it's more subtle--and sexy. The lady who rated it a 3 wasn't fair since it's not her actual opinion of the scent, just based on that her sister didn't use it. Let me tell ya--her sister is missing out. But that's OK--more for me!"
3,It was a gift.,My sister didn't use it after all that trouble I went through! So maybe she'll give it to someone else this Christmas.
1,Cute but a waste,I bought 8 of these cards in various designs for my friends dogs and my own at Xmas. Absolutely not 1 dog was interested in this item.They are cute...but a waste of money since dogs don't like them...I tried 8 different cards with 8 different dogs. Save your money.Petco sells them for $2.99 if you wanna still waste your money.
4,Nice Gift,"I gave this to a friend of mine (dog of course) and he didn't know what to do with it at first, but once he realized it was rawhide he tore it up."
5,Improved version of parts I was replacing,The parts were obviously an updated version. They arrived quickly and installed without problems. I'll go back when I need additional parts.
3,Polaris 340 Drive Belts,"This is the best price you can find for these. The Polaris 340 is not the best cleaner though. A new unit from ""The Pool Cleaner"" is a better cleaner with less trouble and you won't need these belts ever again."
2,Buyer Beware,"As a long time user of System Mechanic 3 (SM3), I am quite disappointed in the quality and integrity of IOLO's System Mechanic 4 (SM4). I upgraded to SM4 based on the good will and trust I developed using SM3. SM4 is a flawed product from a company that prides itself on support. In my opinion, the promoting of excellent support should begin with putting out a product that does what its advertising says it should do, before you have to wait for a fix. After numerous complaints from other users (including myself), IOLO still hasn't got its Disk Degfragging tool that is packaged with SM4 to work efficiently and safely for the all users. When I have asked directly for a refund on this product from the company, I was told all sales are final and I should wait until they fix the product.Very DisappointedWTL"
2,Disk Defrag element is a waste of space,"I bought this product as a whim, hoping to get a complete registry fixer/defragmentation program. The registry 'fixer' portion works pretty good, but the disk defrag program is horrendous compared to even the basic defrag program that comes with XP. I ran diskeeper, windows xp defragmentation, and system mechanic 4's defrag program. XP and diskeeper stated that my drive wasn't even defragmented, while SM4's stated it was about 10% defragmented. The choice between quick and optimized defragmentation is a waste, as well. The optimized defragmentation program states it 'packs' all your data to the front of the drive, thus lessening future defragmentation. Well, I started it at 10 PM, woke up at 7 AM, and the defragmentation was STILL not complete. The rest of the programs are at most partially helpful, as most of their functions can be found in better shareware/freeware programs."
1,Stay Away from this Stinker,"I bought this hot steaming pile of poo at Walmart, installed it, ran some of the utilities, and voila! I had to reinstall Windows XP!!I believe it deleted some critical registry items (I should have known better, so shame on me).I couldn't wait to uninstall this crappy program.Don't walk - RUN away from this one."
1,kind of misleading,"I used this product exactly 1 time then junked it. Its good if you want to find duplicate files, the optimizer just irritated me with a much longer start-up since it compacted the registry, and the de-frag was so lame i had to regedit to disable all active programs except for taskmon.exe and explorer shell or it would read an active drive and restart took an overnite defrag and still nothing. what a waste of time. Don't look to this program if you want to FIND problems and fix them, it only does decent if your computer is problem free to begin with."
4,Solid work,"Is able to provide readers with a new theory (at least in the eyes of westerners probably not so for people in the middle east)The crusaders did not get as far as this did due to the fact that they fought so hard. Rather they got as far as they did because of the internal politics of the Islamic World. At the time of the first crusades the Islamic world was reeling from the assaults of the Tatars and Mongols they really didn't care about the encroachment of crusaders partly because the distance was so vast. An interesting thing to point out and a view that is probably very accurate. The book then provides the reader with an explanation of how this situation was made to come about. Blame mostly gets laid at the feet of the Ottoman Empire.Overall-Goodish book, not the best on the subject but not the worst either."
4,Good Book,"Scottish beauty Vanessa Forster had willingly offered herself as pledge, to be held by Alasdair ""the Devil"" Gray until Clan Forster could pay the fine they owed to him. She counted on her high standing and the March Wardens to protect her from any harm. What she did not anticipate was the seductive charm of the superbly-muscled ""Devil"", who decreed that her duties as pledge included warming his bed. Nor did she expect to enjoy these duties as much as she did...Alasdair Gray had only meant to frighten the emerald-eyed chit away when he demanded that Vanessa share his bed. After all, she was a mere slip of a girl, and, unbeknownst to her, he'd taken her father and brother as the true pledge. But somehow he couldn't resist making good on all his threats. And soon he was revelling in a night of unequaled rapture with a woman who was his sworn enemy. When the sun rose, they would surely be at odds again, but 'til then they would enjoy the fiery ecstasy of forbidden love."
5,The joy of creating music,"Kinshasa Symphony is an amazing film about the challenges of building one of the most complex systems in human cooperation in one of the most chaotic cities in the world - a symphonic orchestra and choir in Kinshasa, DR Congo. It is about Kinshasa and the daily lives of its people, it is about making something work with very little, it is about the joys of rehearsing and performing Beethoven's Ninth and other classical music. Anyone who has ever played in an orchestra or sung in a choir, anyone who has ever been to Africa or is interested in Africa, anyone who has faced challenges with little on hand will greatly enjoy this movie."
4,Not a plug-in fixture!,"Maybe there's a piece of jargon I didn't understand in the product description, but I presumed I'd just mount it and plug it in. It's not a plug in fixture! You must hard wire it into your system. (It took me about five minutes, but if you're not familiar with electrical, beware.)Other than that, it's fine. It's pretty cheapo, but it all went together in a snap. From opening the box to turning on the light, even with the wiring bit, it took maybe 15 minutes.I'll buy more..."
3,No instructions,"There were no installation instructions included with the light, and none are available on the manufacturer's web site. It isn't too difficult to figure out how to mount and wire the fixture, but if you aren't comfortable doing that on your own, you may want to consider a different product and manufacturer."
1,Nice looking light that has issues,"A nice looking, quiet, light that has two major issues,First, as others noted, the plastic diffuser can't withstand shipping. After reading the reviews, I gambled and ordered six- only 2 arrived intact, 3 were usable with cracks, 1 was unusable.Second, the sheet metal fixture has a center raised rib maybe 2-1/2"" wide where the mounting holes are. Depending on your J-box, centering the knockout on the J-box, you miss the rafter and will need to use anchors...making installation even more difficult (trying to hold it up against the ceiling, AND parallel to the wall, etc.).On a trip I was able to go to Home Depot (none near me) and they have the same fixture for about the same price AND replacement diffusers (pricey at about $25)Amazon is great but this didn't work out."
4,Good light,"Easy to install, great light, bright. Only complaint, when it arrived the diffuser was crushed in shipping. Fortunately, I had a spare, I didn't want to wait for a new one to be shipped. So far, I love the light."
4,Good Product,I have purchased about 20 of these units over the last year and found them to be efficient and reliable. Only one arrived damaged. My favorite feature is the low current draw which enables me to get more lights on one circuit.
2,A big disappointment,"I recently bought all four ""Art of Star Wars"" books, and was profoundly disappointed by the ""New Hope"" and ""Jedi"" books. Of the books I was disappointed by, this book, ""A New Hope,"" is the lamer of the two. ""A New Hope,"" huh? What an absolute misnomer. Lucasfilm crammed the script into this book, as well some awful childrens' art, and a bunch cartoons that refer to Star Wars. I DIDN'T BUY this book for the script, which can be found a zillion other places, I DIDN'T BUY it for some weak attempts at humour that play off of Star Wars, and I CERTAINLY didn't shell out my money for some nursery school scribblings! I bought it for the artwork, but, sorry to say, this book tells me NOTHING about it! Unfortunately, I wanted the art badly enough that I decided in the end to put up my hard-earned cash, but man, I'm NOT happy about it."
5,the one that started it all,"Still my favorite movie, and it's great to see the artistic beginning of it all. It gives a different flavor to the making of the movie. For someone who loves the movie and has an artistic bent, this is for you."
2,Not a home run.,"The art work was not something that I liked. It wasn't as unique as other Starwars books. I realize that it is a chance I take when I buy something and that is OK. Sometimes I ride the horse and sometimes the horse rides me, so be it."
4,Old Reliable,"I bought this a couple years ago. Didn't use it for the first year or so because I ended up not really having a use for it. Plus the first time I tried to set it up, like the others who have posted, I thought it was limited to one of 2Wire's gateways. After aquiring an older iMac, it was a cheaper route to wireless internet than an airport card at the time, so I gave it another go. The instructions are quite confusing, but I was able to get it to work with my Netgear RangeMax Super G router. You can manually configure these, it just takes some patience, and a couple times at reading the directions and messing with the software. I thought it would be slow, but with it's b+ 22mbps capability, it was much quicker than expected, and seemed to match perfectly with the speed of the Rev. D 333mhz iMac I hooked up to it. I've been using it on an off between my Playstation 2 and the Mac for the past 2 years and it hasn't failed me once."
5,2Wire Wireless Ethernet Client/Gaming Adapter,"This device is very simple to set up even though its confusing directions tempted me to limit it to 4 stars. To play Xbox 360 online or connect another device to the internet through this Wireless Client you're network would need to include a 2Wire HomePortal or OfficePortal. Note: This device can only be setup on the computer directly connected to the HomePortal Modem. Connect the Client to the HomePortal via ethernet cable, plug it in, and the CD-ROM recognizes and automatically configures the Client. The Client is then connected to the gaming console and plugged into an outlet and there you have it, online gaming at a fraction of the cost of the 360 wireless adapter. The only catch being that it's only compatible with a network using HomePortal hardware."
4,Very Good Watch,"Very good watch, plenty of features and classy look. It is on the heavy side and the Indigo lighting of the face rather than the hands is not effective to tell time..."
2,Nice but fragile,I really like the look of the watch but I accidentally hit it on a door frame and the crystal chipped. Timex won't repair broken crystals.
5,Great watch at a great price.,"Just a good, practical, robust and attractive watch at a very good price. Not likely to impress anyone but the wearer but if you are shopping at this price point you probably don't care."
2,not so great,"this is the first time i am disappointed with Amazon.I received this watch there was some problem, so i raised a concern the amazon team responded quickly and replaced the order. I got the replacement watch but there were some scratches on the glass (seems like not the fresh piece).The buttons on the watch are very hard to press, never had such kind of issues with my other Timex, fossil & citizen watches i have. the crono alignment is not good, the second bar alignment is not accurate"
2,Much Too Thick,"To get the depth of the ""look"", this watch had to be thick - - much too thick for me.Otherwise it runs ok."
4,"Functional, looks good","This watch caters toward folks who want a watch that is primarily characterized by functional, legible, and inexpensive (in a way that you won't trip over yourself protecting it). As other reviewers said: this color allows the time to be easily read in bright sunlight, indoors, and in the dark. The reflective print on the hands glows well in the dark, and the indigo is clear. The outer dial is fake and does not rotate."
4,"Good watch, elegant. Good choice.","Looks a little small than i saw in the picture, but is a beautiful. I recomend it."
1,JUNK,"I got this not even 2 months and the thing just broke. No reason for it, just broke, the adjuster or whatever it's called, when I was setting to advance my watch a few minutes ahead and I couldn't do it and when I took off my watch to see what was wrong the thing just fell out.DON'T BUY"
1,failed within 2 weeks,"This watch looks nice, but I wore it into the pool twice and moisture got inside the crystal. The whole watch failed about a week later. I was very disappointed."
3,one problem,"I find it hard to make out the time in the dark because the hour, minute, and second hands can be easily misread. I am 81 years old and have weak vision without my glasses."
5,So far so good,I've had bad experiences with Timex in the past. But I like this watch and I am giving it a chance to change my mind on Timex. So far so good.
2,Second Hand not moving anymore,I found only one problem. The second hand doesn't move at sometimes. And then again after 1-2 days it starts moving all by itself ?!!
2,Great Service!,Excellent Service. Received it sooner than expected and the watch was excellent; as described on Amazon.ZG
1,No Manual comes with this watch - Take risk if you want to try,"I brought this watch few days back, and it does not come with Instruction Manual. It is like getting a little complex machine with out Instruction Manual. What do any do with it?? Just try couple of options. I did the same. I could turn very few functions, but not the one which I brought this watch for.(which is using it for alarm) I also could not able to set Date. I could only able to set time. I hate any machine does not come with Manual, weather small or big (It is electronic gadget!!!). Even though the watch looks OK, I still could not use the main feature of this watch,for which I brought.I can't give more than 1 star."
5,Really Nice Watch for the Price,"I came across this watch while looking for a casual brown leather band watch. I orginally was looking at the Tissot, forget which model, and came across this one. This Timex looks very, very similar to the Tissot, but without the $400 price tag. I decide for the price of the Timex, there is little to lose. I have been very happy with my decision. The functions are very easy to use and the watch has some weight to it. But most of all, I love the look. I have just began collecting watches and for one of the cheapest costing watches that I have, I find myself wearing this one more than the others. I highly recommend it."
3,"Good, but not so good","The watch is great in every respect except one. White hands on a white background make it really hard to read, especially in dim light."
2,Nice but unreliable alarm,"I have just returned the second Timex Chrono Alarm Watch with an unreliable alarm after a few days/weeks of use. It just doesn't sound every now and then, probably every once in 10 to 20 times, failure rate increases over time. A shame since the watch is very nice and keeps the time very accurately. We have had 5 Timex watches in the family over the past ~6 years. Out of those 5, 3 had to be returned due to failures. The other two have run for ~4 and ~6 years with no problem now. While these two certainly provide a good value for the money, a success rate of 40% is not very convincing and the idea to outsource quality control to the customer might be fashionable but will hopefully not turn out a successful business strategy after all."
2,Disappointing watch,"My past experience with Timex watches showed them to be reliable and tough. That's why I ordered this one. I guess my tastes have changed. I bought about two dozen watches last year and nearly all of them were in the larger style that is currently popular.When this one arrived I was immediately struck by its comparatively small size (of the dial). Because it seemed so small it looked very cluttered, what with three sub-dials crammed onto the small face. The color looked washed-out too.When I tried setting the watch the crown unscrewed and came off after very few turns. The final straw was when I tried it on: the strap was too long for my relatively small wrist, leaving the end of the strap sticking out and unsightly.It might make a great work watch for someone with larger wrists, but it simply didn't suit my needs and I returned it to Amazon."
2,"Nice looking watch, too bad it doesn't work properly","I liked the looks of this watch and the reasonable price, but couldn't decide between the black or the white model, so I ordered both. Neither of them worked correctly. The black watch had a DOA indiglo light. On both watches the chronograph would not reset automatically. Another reviewer recommended hitting the button at just the right moment to stop it. Come on, that is not the way it's supposed to work. The instructions clearly state that it will reset to the proper position by itself.In addition, the date can only be advanced by moving the hour hand a full 24 hours for each day you want to advance. I've had date watches for more than 40 years and the last time I saw that was in 1965.On the other hand, if you're not bothered by the above it is a very attractive watch at a reasonable price. I almost kept the white one anyway, but decided to send them both back."
3,Big Bertha,"Attractive functions and appearance, but very thick and heavy. Hope I'm strong enough to wear it!"
4,Timex Still Ticks,"Dependability and style at a great price, a real value. This Timex Chrono Alarm has more features than I expected. It's packed with more features than watches I've paid much more for. I'm more satisfied with this watch than more expensive watches I own.The dials make sense. You can actually read them. It has two alarms and I was surprised to find it has a great back light. It's possible to catch up the date or to re-adjust for daylight savings without losing your time settings.The only minor issue is that I can't figure out what turns the beep off sometimes. (I probably need re-read the instructions.)Overall I'm more than satisfied with this purchase. I'm a big Timex fan again."
5,"Every VC should read this, it will save and make millions","John and Peter have brought a wealth of personal experience to the problem of bringing innovative products to market. Millions of dollars chase new ideas that have no hope of success.Entrepreneurs, product planners and managers, business strategists will all be well served by the insight and by following the guidance inside this book.If you've got a great idea for a revolutionary product - read this book."
1,don't be misled!,"There is no information on the CD about the artistand as near as I can tell none of these tracks feature the artist who made them famous. For example, J'attendrai was sung by Dalida but on this CD it is an instrumental! Buyer beware."
1,Poor cover versions,"Some of the most popular known French chansons are better known by their famous and fantastic cover versions. ""La vie en rose"" has seen some beautiful ones - but here I found a collection of the worst covers I've ever heard. ""Et maintenant"" needs Gilbert Becaud and not a heartless ""dub-di-dub-dub ..."" I'm just thankful that my copy of this album came from the local library and I didn't spend a dime on it."
5,"Super versatile, pretty colors. Love love love these.",These plates are awesome. I got them because I liked that they had raised sides so that my kids have an easier time forking their food. The colors are pretty and they are very sturdy.
2,No In Game Saves!,No in game saves makes the game impossible to beat! The Max Payne format would have made this a fantastic experience. Don't waste your money.
1,Failed in 34 days,Bought this watch 34 days ago. Just 4 Days after return period expired the watch died. Just stopped working. Now I have to work thru the product warranty to get it fixed or replaced and that is a much more complicated process. Very unhappy for this type of watch to die in 34 days.
4,Ive been playing this for a few years,"And it is a good quality amp. I have had no problems with it. I get good cleans out of it, and I get good distortion.I have plugged it into a 4x12 diezel halfstack and it sounds great, or it has been mic'd and sounds great.The tones are awesome.If you want to to hear it in a thrash style band, here it is.[...]"
2,Weird Set Up,"Minimally helpful for an ""Idiot"" who even had some beginner Spanish background. I missed the fact that this book is not geared to Latin American Spanish, therefore little to no Mexican Spanish phrases. The book's format is one which is set by context: travel, money, food, etc. but it is extremely difficult to find the phrases if you are not in sync with how the authors decided what context would include which phrase. Every phrase also had the phonetic spelling with/beside it, which I did not need, and made it cumbersome to peruse through the text. Mostly this pocket guide is not getting a great review from me because it wasn't what I wanted. I lost a pocket guide some years ago, and have not been able to ""replace"" it."
3,An interesting book,"Tommy, aka the Shadow, is the main character of this book. A middle class kid growing up in post world war two, tommy and his friend Gerald try to find out who beat up their friend's father. I found this book to br fairly interesting, writen in the style of any young boy who thinks of himself as a great detective or whatnot. The characters are very human, all with their own habits, ect. The plot could have had some more dillema in it , though."
5,Life Like Product,We bought this product because our 9 yr. old grandson is a budding fisherman. He really liked the vivid colors and lifelike shape of the trout. It really complimented his Christmas tree.
1,CRAP!!!!!,"This movie is one of the crappest i've ever seen. Avoid it like the bubonic plague. be prepared to spoon your eyeballs from your sockets if caught in a room where it is playing. If I could give it a rating of minus ten stars, I would."
2,Look for something else .........,"........ purchased this for college student gifts .... all said, ""hey, send something else, these don't work."""
2,Not worth it,"This book has some good information and is helpful when learning solid state physics. However, almost all of the material is available online and the simulations are quite dated."
2,Can we have a re-write?,"This book would have been better if it weren't being used as another platform for Grimassi's view that the Etruscans are responsible for all modern Paganism today. Not enough information about Celtic practices, and too much stretching on the Italian info. If I wanted to read about Italian Witchcraft (as opposed to reading about Beltane), I'd pick up one of his books more overtly on topic. Additionally, I tried two of the recipes out of this book, and neither turned out. The recipe for the wreath cake was especially disastrous -- Llewellyn needs to check the measurements!"
3,a good novices primer,"If you have just begun your research into the history and practice of Beltane this book will be helpful. It provided a general background of the rituals surrounding Beltane. It lacked information for those who are already familiar with the practices involved with the sabbat. Good reading for the novice, it lacked the details we were looking for"
2,Not worth the $ + Tax I paid for it.,"This book had few good points to it (the opperative word being ""few""). So, here are my point by point likes & dislikes:Dislikes:* It was too short to possibly cost $ (plus tax) * He does not include a single recipe for an incense or oil, etc. * He only includes 4 spells in the book * His list of Beltane herbs and flowers is too short. * He wastes space with so many lengthy fairy tales. * There just doesn't seem to be enough effort on the part of Mr. Grimassi, and it sadly shows.Likes:* The FEW herbal correspondance. * The VERY LITTLE faery info. * The art work throughout the book."
3,Good but...British,"I agree with the point made above: ""a comprehensive introduction to the issues central to the practice of assessment. Teachers, administrators, and other educators are exposed to the critical aspects of assessment...."" But it is not clear that the author is talking about assessment in Britain with just occasional reference to assessment in the USA. The conceptual coverage seems good but the examples given require students and instructor to constantly search for a comparable assessment in the USA. This can interfere with the actual learning. If the book is used as a refresher with teachers and administrators who already have experience with a variety of assessments it may work better but it is not for those inexperienced in assessment in US schools."
3,4 star marred by muffled audio,"This is one of 10 Hot Licks DVDs I've purchased. It's the only one with an audio problem. The audio is highly muffled which is unpleasant to listen to but is intelligible. It's as though the second stage of Dolby noise reduction was applied against a non-Dolby encoded recording.I also own Arlen's Master of Stratocaster DVD which repeats a good portion of what's here. Despite this, I found it's a good value because Arlen does a good job of addressing how to play hot licks on an acoustic which is my motivation for this purchase. Loaded with tips for taking advantage of the instrument in each of the popular keys. The vast amount of material presented makes it hard to believe it's only 63 minutes long. This is intended for non-beginners."
5,How to see the Poland that Poles see.,"I am planning my first trip to Poland. I want to see the Poland that the natives see, - no Western hotels and restaurants. I am interested in the culture from the Polish perspective - my ancestral background, not from an American perspective - my contemporary relatives. I bought this book because it is the best, and for the personal help available from the hospitality hosts/hostesses in Poland- to help me plan the trip and assist me once I am in Poland. No other book offers such help."
4,NOT PLASTIC,"One of the reviewers claimed it's ""plasticised""... don't be FOOLED.. this is NOT PLASTIC.It's still a nice big screen (but I think it would be better if it were plastic...:)"
3,OKAY,I never really understood the DM screen. to me it was useless but its very informative for beginers who dont know the rules very well.
2,Not much can be said,"I have been playing D&D since 1976, the only good thing I can say is that the screen is larger than the ones made for the first ed. or second ed. the infomation on the back of the screen is not worth the money. Your better off making your own screen,than using this one."
3,"It's a Screen, not a cancer cure.","If 3rd edition hadn't went and streamlined the bulky,cumbersome rules of Second Edition into a tight, cohesive whole, this screen would have been 'useful'. As it stands, this thing is overpriced for what it does. And what it does is sell us something that could have just as easily been included with the DM guide itself. 4- 5 cent photocopies of the relevant material + 1 2nd edition DM screen =3rd edition DM screen."
3,"Really neat, but...","First of all i'd like to say that the new DM screen is great. It has got all the tables you want and so on. BUT, why buy this screen when you can make one yourself without problem? To be honest, i don't know. If you've got much money to spend, you'll probably wanna buy it because of the cool design, but that's all."
3,This item is overpriced for what it gives,"As stated before, this item is overpriced for what it gives, the idea of a 2nd edition screen was nice, for the complex of the rules, but, in 3rd edition this is of no use, I rarely refer to the tables in the screen, for me, it's an accesory to hide dice rolls, and show the players a nice art."
2,What? Are we reviewing the same product here?,"Our group found this product very nearly entirely useless. A poorly executed design plus the accompanying amateurish artwork makes this item a sore thumb in the WOTC product line.It should be noted here that I am a longtime DM and player of D&D in all of its incarnations (1st through 3rd, over 20 years) and a great fan of the latest edition, and most of the products WOTC have released. This however, is a huge exception. Just save your money and make your own."
3,Functional but Nothing Special,"The 3rd edition D&D Dungeon Master's Screen is a serviceable product. The tables it provides are useful, and the art is pretty good. However, the screen doesn't really have the kind of functionality that would make it a must have. Also, I think it would be more practical if the screen itself were more rigid. If you want to use a screen for your game, this is the one. If not, you're not missing anything vital."
4,"Good, but....","It could be better. It's a bit expencive, and it should COME with the DM Guide like alot of other's say. It's got a whole lot of very usefull information on the side that the DMs see, so, it's more good than not."
4,"Nice, but.......","Okay, first of all we really should not have to buy these screens seperatly, shouldn't they just stick this in the DM guide? This is okay for all DMs but the art isn't all that eye-catching. Overall this is good if don't have the time to print out your own, and to whoever said it was small, no it's not!"
5,Keep your notes and rolls secret,"Excellent screens for the new D&D, a must for any Dungeon Master to keep your notes and rolls secret.It's a 4 panel screen, lots of useful tables on the DM's side and art on the players's side. The tables have a white background that makes them easier to read, and the screen itself is folded in a way that the center is pointing away so it doesn't eat up your space.It's built with a not so thick cardboard, but it holds itself upright with no problem. I wish it were a little thicker but it's not a problem as it is, just a matter of taste."
2,Poor Design Overshadows Good Content,"I think the designers of this product missed the boat. They have included the essential information that a screen should have, but the materials chosen are rather poor.While this laminated screen might prove more durable than the cardboard stock screens of earlier editions, it is too elastic and resists being unfolded across the breadth of a table. It snaps back to an area that only hides a little more than a single stack of 8x11 papers.Maybe it can bbe salvaged with pressing or additional support, but if I'm going to need to do this extra work, I might as well just pull the material off the web and paste it on some descent cardboard."
3,8min arms,Instructor goes a little quick between the work outs. He doesnt give a lot of time to change weights between excercises.
2,not for homes over 1800 sq ft,I purchased this system for my 2850 sq ft home. The phones are nice and user friendly but the singles are very weak and do not cover the entie house. They drop call or your getting a scratchy sound but once you move closer to the base it is some better. I have put the base in a central portion of my house but it still gives out a poor single.
4,Does the job.,"I use this charger for ""overnight"" charging of various PowerSonic sealed lead acid batteries (4-10AH). It seems to do the job. I bought it because it was small and easily carried in a travel kit. The red and green status lights are appreciated. So far, no problems. Incidentally, this model does not have a DC pigtail, you have to furnish that. No problem for me as I made up a short pigtail with Anderson PowerPole connectors to fit my specific needs."
3,Great product but I ordered 2 sets and one came broke,"The green lights work like a charm, however one of them was zip tied too tight and broke the inside....I was very displeased with that but other then that shipping was fast and again they work great. I would def. recommend to a friend"
5,LED,"This product is very shine and nice in my case, only disappointing parts are first, the plastic ties are annoy on the cable, hardly to take off, also i prefer use some tap to locate this product because the one it come with does not doing a good job"
2,no light,"horrible product. ive never bought a cold cathod item before. but im sure when it lights up the whole thing is supposed to light up not just half. wondering if its just damaged by coming in the mail or i just got a defective item. oh well, next time ill go with leds"
3,It's an alright book,This book is alright. There were two things that I found that I would do for Christmas. The other ideas were OK.
2,Very dissapointed,"I was looking for a basic laser level to use it outdoors, my decision was based on the reviews but my experience with this level laser indicates me that it is not suitable for use it outdoors, you can barely see the laser dot on the sunlight or don't see it at all. Also the level itself has only one point of reference which is almost useless; it will work well on a flat surface, it says you can use it for cabinet installations but they forgot to tell you that you will need a tripod to do it properly, not so accurate for plumb and square, magnet not so strong. There are better options out there."
5,sharing strong felings,"Although a person from Bosnia wrote this song, I as a palestinian identify with the words stongly; I also have nocannons that roar and I also feel suppresed as the muslims in Bosnia did. My friend from Iran feels the same way. Islam is mis-interpreted, misjudjged and mis-practiced by so many wrong-doers and wrong-wishers. When I saw the little boy die next to his father on his way to shopping, by Israelis, my heart broke. This song gives me a feeling beyond explanation. God bless Yusu Islam and his talent."
5,Excellent CD,I love this CD. It's a must if you just want some nice music for background or something to relax too. Very soothing... A must have.
4,Nice music to listen to to relax,"I liked this CD, didn't absolutely love it, but for the price, it really is a good deal. I listen to it in between some of my other japanese cds. The songs are short but lovely."
3,pluverized not shredded,"this item is just mediocre in taste, but what was disturbing was the shredded aspect. not by my definition. it is more like small grain rice size. think powder snow.the price is a tad on the high side compared to getting similar product at several other places."
4,"Good, but maybe a little easy for 5 & 6 year olds","We just got our computer, and my son loves Pooh. He is almost 5 years old, so we purchased this game for him. In the game each section has 3 levels in which you get a gold star for each one completed. It has eight different areas which your child can go into. When you are done getting all the gold stars for each level, there is a graduation with Pooh and the other characters. Most areas he had no problem with. A couple areas took him a little longer. We have had this came for 2 weeks now and he has already graduated about 7 times. However, he still loves to play it. (Although, it could be because it's the only one he has). All in all, he has learned a few things he didn't know before and he has fun with it."
1,Don't buy it,"I have never seen a worse product for children, of any age.First of all -- it has bugs! That's a total no-no.The instructions are obtuse, at best. Sometimes they are downright misleading.Some screens don't have the exit arrow at all and you have to stumble through the program to get out.The modules are unimaginative, unvaried and downright boring. In addition, they are really not rated right by age -- they are much too easy for my pre-schooler, let alone a kindergartner!"
1,"Terrible software, worse customer service!!!","I purchased Norton Internet Security 3.0 which includes Norton AntiVirus. I installed on my new Macbook pro. The software crashed my system and gave error messages on start-up and upon runnig. Only after multiple installs and 2 hours waiting for a customer service on their on-line chat, did they inform me that it does not work with OS 10!!! Nowhere during purchase do they note this significant draw-back and compatibility issue. You also can only talk to a representative by paying $9.95 and waiting. With the download, they only allow you to download during a two month period. After that if you would have to re-purchase the software to re-download."
1,pointless,"You've got a mac right? You've got OS 10.4, right? Why do you need this? Why did I buy it?"
1,Norton AntiVirus is a virus,"This software is little more than another virus. Full of unnecessary pop-ups. Slows the computer down. And worst of all, it cannot be uninstalled as evidenced by the complaints about it online. Google ""How to uninstall Norton antivirus from Macintosh."" and you will find thousands of complaints about it as well as complaints that Symantec won't support it. In my experience, all of the complaints are justified. Don't waste your money or endanger your Mac with this turd that won't flush."
2,Very disappointed,"I've worked with Norton AntiVirus (the consumer product) and Symantec AntiVirus (the corporate product) for PCs and they're great.Unfortunately Symantec has dropped the ball when it comes to the Mac version of Norton AntiVirus 10 (NAV10).First off, NAV10 interferes with Final Cut Pro and causes overall system instability.Second, NAV10 ""does work"" with Intel Macs but it is not a Universal App -- meaning that it uses Rosetta and ultimately more memory resources.I would recommend ClamXav because it works plain and simple, however it is not ""supported."" I use my Mac for mission-critical work so I must stick with an anti-virus program that offers technical support like Norton AntiVirus. I use NAV10 and it ""works"" most of the time but I'd rather use ClamXav."
4,Solid,"Norton AntiVirus for the Mac has been surprisingly solid for me so far. When I first got it I installed it (which was quite simple), and then I ran a virus scan. Like other reviewers I agree that this took much longer than it should have. That is the reason it only got 4 stars. However, once it was done doing a total scan of the HD it had found 4 virii. They were all Windows virii, but I still don't want that kind of stuff on my iBook. I use a Windows desktop and a Mac laptop. This software has already proved it's worth the money because of the virii it was able to destroy. I haven't tried any other antiVirus software, but I can tell you that this is a solid piece of software. If you have a Mac, even though the threat of a virus is near non-existent, it's a good idea to protect your investment. Get some kind of protection so when a virus writer finally does exploit a vulnerability in OSX you'll be prepared."
3,The Prune Book by John H. Trattner,"Anyone in line for these high-level gigs probably already knows this stuff. If they don't they're in big trouble. This is fundamental, press-kit-type information for the most part.But the book is not an encyclopedia of every agency boss job in Washington. It examines only sixty Executive Schedule jobs out of a total of 1,100 Presidential appointments.The book is a handy resource for the journalist or agency-watcher. It's valuable for its clear-sighted, undogmatic observations on White House staff and their relation to the cabinet, as well as the well-organized introductory chapters on each agency. It includes a lot of sound background information like who reports to whom, what the big issues are facing an agency, and how it has handled them recently."
2,Not a great Wireless printer,Yes the Ink is cheaper- will not take that credit away. However the Quality compared to the HP Photosmart printers- it can not even come close. Also when you have not used it in a day or two- the wireless goes off- which means you have to go and turn off the printer and turn it back on to reconnect to your wireless. Really a pain in the butt!! If you are going to use it as a direct connect to your computer- I would say that it is a good buy- but using it in wireless mode- not so good.
2,"Jams,jams, jams","Ordered this printer in January. I was very happy with it for a few days. In february, after very little use, it begin to jam every time I copied or printed.Called support and after trying for hours to solve the problem, Kodak agreed to send me a new printer. True to their word, the new printer arrived in only 2 workingdays and I returned the old ones in the container provided. The new printer worked very well, for several days. Then after hardly using it for a month or so, .....the same thing all over again, jam after jam.I am currently trying to decide if I want to go through the various attempts to make it work or the task of sending for another and packing this one off. I may just attempt toget my money back and order an HP. Although the support team at Kodak is very cooperative and does their best to satisfy, this printer seems to have a built in flaw thatcauses it to jam."
1,Spend your money elseswhere,I've had problems with this printer since i purchased it. It never prints with the right amount of ink nor can it find the edge of the paper. Don't waste your money or time on this one.
1,did not last 1 year!!! UPDATE,"I purchased this in January 2011. It no longer will print or copy using black ink. It isn't much better with the color ink . I just replaced both cartridges, cleaned the heads, went to Kodak trouble shooting and it still is no good.Also, the ink runs out really quickly, so it has not proven to be any cheaper than an HP.PLEASE DO YOURSELF A FAVOR - DO NOT BUY THIS PRINTERNext day update: I called Kodak. Since the printer was under warranty they sent me a new print head at no cost to me. It got to me in 2 days. HOWEVER, since it needed to be calibrated and I printed a test sheet, my ink supply is down to 1/2 (granted, some of that is due to the calibration and test pages I tried printing when I was trouble shooting.) SO I still don't think this printer is all that much of a bargain. I have a feeling that this is a common problem since the support person I spoke to had no problems sending me the new head. I didn't even suggest it, it was her solution to the problem."
2,Be warned that they use color ink to make black,"The ink may be ""cheap"" but this is another system which has decided to rip off consumers by using the colored ink to create black, rather than simply using the black cartridge. So, if all you print is B&W docs, you will see your colored cartridge disappear (very quickly. When you try to bypass this, it won't work and you will have to keep replacing the color cartridge to print only B&W. Otherwise, it's a bit quirky, we've had trouble with it disappearing from the network, only some features work at a time, and we have had to reinstall. Right now the wireless feature is missing...which is the feature that made me choose this unit over another one. : Color is sad, doesn't match as it should and not very rich at all...really not a printer I'd buy again."
2,Hate it!,"I hate this thing. It is very slow and for some reason it uses up colored ink even if you only print in black and white. When the color cartridge runs out, it just stops working!! The ""inexpensive"" cartridges run out quickly so this thing is basically worthless except for faxing."
2,Don't Buy to Print Text Only,"I use this printer for text exclusively. It does a good job as far as that goes; it prints fairly quickly, and the text looks fine. The big problem I have, which has been mentioned in several reviews, is the color cartridge running out even though I literally never print anything but black text, and have the ""print color images in black and white"" option checked just to be safe. Even using the printer this way, I still run out of color ink very quickly, and it refuses to do anything, including scanning, until I replace the color cartridge. Absolutely ridiculous."
4,help from customer sevice,"we download sofeware to main computer (a-ok) copying finethen download to laptop for wifi (fine) no go. I went to customer sevice on lineit was hard for me to comunicate my spelling not goodcustomer sevicer took control of my laptop I don't know where they'er at , this was strangeto see my laptop move with out my help.an hour later I'm copying are so I thinkwe said by,I turn off copy machine turn it back on (guess what) no copying the two were not taikingthis time I call customer sevice one hour weight I push wrong buttom had to call again and weight this time this guy uninstall somethings then reinstall other thing .some hours later I amcopying and still copyingcustomer sevicer was great"
4,Okay Printer But Could Use More Options,"The Kodak 6150 All In One Printer is eay to set up and use is easy also. The ink cartridges are inexpensive and the photo quality is way above average near perfect for the do it at home photograpghy buff. Although these are good remarks and qualities in a printer there are some features this printer is missing and should have been included in the design. The biggest one being there is NO SEPARATE PHOTO PAPER TRAY. To print photos you need to first pull out the paper tray, unload all the paper in the tray and then insert photo paper and readjust the tray size to the approx. photo paper size and replace the tray into the printer. This is a big dissappointment and had I known I would have really reconsidered buying this model. If this printer is going to be used just for office use, printing, faxing and coping only, then it will do just fine for you, but someone looking for all the bells and whistles of an excellent printer will be disappointed with this model."
3,so so,I received this unit and it would not work but the company that shipped it refunded the total price which was excellent of the company and I would recomend them. I contacted kodak and they are sending a new print head and I hope that that makes it work. I had another of the same unit and it worked ok for about a year and then it quite and so I ordered a another unit since I had alot of ink cartridges for the same unit. I hope that it will work in the future.
2,Was awesome while it worked,This unit did everything it said it would do and did it flawlessly....for awhile.Then about a year and a half later the print head became permanently jammed.While its sitting complaining about the print head jam it also will not perform the other tasks which it would have still been capable of doing. Called Kodak about it and they said I could buy a referb at a reduced price... not worth it considering the price of a new printer.I was excited to get this actually so definitely a little disappointed but I guess every purchase can't be a great one.
1,kodak printer,Was led to understand it used less ink. It has all colored ink in one cartridge so therefore you must buy whole new cartridg if one color runs out. Not good.
4,Got what I was looking for,"I can't give it 5 stars because I have only had it for one month, but I am very happy with the Kodak ESP 6150 so far.I like how easy it is to load paper.I also like the that you have the option of the wireless connection.The on-screen instructions for the different functions of the Kodak ESP 6150 are straightforward.I will update my review when I get the chance to use the other features of the Kodak ESP 6150.So far I would recommend."
1,Worst Printer Ever!,"I am on my second Kodak ESP Office 6150 due to printer problems. First one to many issues and had to go back to Kodak now 2nd one just as many issues! Huge waste of money and troubleshooting time. Won't feed paper through the machine so I have to force each sheet of paper through, alot of the time won't even print, uses just as much ink as any other printer only this one you have to have the color cartridge too or it won't print at all. Won't feed papers properly through the fax tray. Printer error messages all the time so it has to be unplugged and rebooted all the time. To many issues especially for the cost of the machine. F- on this product."
2,DO NOT BUY THIS PRINTER IF YOU WANT TO SAVE MONEY.,"I bought this printer last February. It works great. I bought it because Kodak advertises that it uses less ink. I have my defaults set to black and draft print. I never use the color, or do I ever print anything other than documents. But, my color ink keeps running out. I have contacted the company 2 times about this. I was told both times that even when you are only printing in black it still uses the color ink! I have also been told there is not a fix for this. I am on my 3rd color cartridge, pretty bad for never printing in color.So, while this is a good printer, you will NOT save any money."
1,DANGER WILL ROBINSON - JAM ERROR 3257,"Had the printer for a bit over a year, printed some nice photos though the ink does not last long. Used it one day to print a document, the next day it was jammed. This, apparently, is a common issue with Kodak Printers. The way to fix it is to buy a non-Kodak. DANGER WILL ROBINSON -DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!"
4,More than adequately meets our needs,"+'s easy to set up, particularly the wireless feature; software download is also simple and easy and works well on three different machines and operating systems (HP Windows 8 tower, HP Vista laptop, ACER Windows 7 Startup laptop); color quality is 8 out of 10 ... has difficulty printing numerous changes within a single color tone (ie. a dress with multiple pleats) and color shades are not completely accurate; ink consumption is better than I expected from other reviews-'s large and boxy size; if user isn't careful, the cover slams shut ... there's no cushioning mechanismwould definitely recommend to others ... very good multi-function printer for the price!"
4,happy customer,i have only had this printer for a couple of weeks but am very happy that i bought this printer it has all the functions i need and setup was even easier than i expected.it has very good quality printing and it is quick on top of it the ink is cheap. i would recommend this printer to anyone.
5,Really like this printer,"I am not surprised by all the negative reviews, but I just purchased this printer again, after using the first one for over two years (someone hit the pole holding the transformer in front of my house and blew out the printer apparently, as it stopped instantly at that moment) while i agree with the seemingly fast use of ink, my mother uses hp and the cost of ink is incredible, even if each cartridge lasts longer, there are like 6 of them and they are not cheap! my printer worked excellent for a long period of time, and now they are only 99.00, so i decided to get another one. it seems like all electronics now a days are good or become obsolete after a year or two anyway, so i figure if i get that long it will be worth it. ink is still lower than other printers. i never had a problem with the printer head, all the features worked perfectly for the two years of usage.all in all i would, and have, purchased again!"
1,sorry excuse for an all in one,"Uses color print cartridge as default to print black( although it has a black cartridge)-once the color cartridge is empty you cannot print black either and the all-in-one basically becomes a paperweight. You have to keep a color cartridge in it. Some engineering job there, but the low cost ink marketing sells the machines AND a lot of color ink. As a former engineer with an MBA, I can say that such products are not something that leads to brand loyaty or customer share. As a practicing attorney for nearly 20 years, I would suggest that it also tends to get you sued."
1,Worst printer I have ever owned,"Among the problems:1. Updating drivers has been a mess. The computer thinks there are multiple printers on line.2. Paper jams are more frequent than with any printer I've owned.3. The paper feeder for the scanner has never once worked properly.4. The scanner software is confusing with no decent instruction.5. Wireless printing has been intermittent.6. The printheads are already nonfunctioning (in less than three months)!7. Ink costs are not as low as I was led to believe. (Should have heeded other reviewers' advice on this.)Kodak, what has happened to you? You used to set the standards for the rest of your industry!"
2,Very Disappointed in Paper Handling & Wireless Printing,The wireless printing only works if my macbook is within 6 feet of it - so it kind of defeats the purpose of wireless printing. Yes had support team give me solutions but they didn't work. My main complaint is that it refused to detect the edge of a decorative PRINTER PAPER I bought for invitations and therefore wouldn't print. After trying all the solutions suggested by the support dept. the Kodak rep finally told me I'd have to buy a different paper! This is unacceptable. It won't detect anything but white paper? Or I have to keep buying different papers until it decides which one it likes? This is obviously a design or programming flaw and I am going to try to get my money back. I've had this printer for 11 months.
3,Kodak printer ESP 6150,"The printer prints fine. The advertisment stated the machine would print on both sides of the paper, I foundthat under the program word, it asked for one or two side printing, but I have not found a way to print both sides of paper when printing from an article of news and etc found on the computer. Please help."
2,Lousy Purchase,"The price tag makes it seem like a great purchase, but after buying this printer I quickly found out it isn't. Kodak may boast the least expensive ink cartridge, but this printer burns through them. My wife prints off a few coupons a week, and my kids don't use the printer. If you print at all you'll be replacing the ink cartridges a few times a month. This includes the 10C and 10XL cartridges. The 10 XL includes maybe a 1/4 ounce more ink, but you pay a premium for it. It's the same cartridge with just a little more ink. The printer is the noisiest printer I've heard. The all-in-one features are great, but as a printer it's awful. When you shell out a few bucks for a printer, you end up paying a lot more in ink. Save your money and invest in a quality printer."
2,Worst headache printer ever.,"I had this printer for over a year now. At first everything was running smooth but wasn't too excited about the print quality. Oh well I figured - since the ink is cheap, I would live with it. Not so much, I'm finding myself replacing the ink cartridge twice as many times as my hp, which by the way had better print quality even at ""fast draft"" settings (uses less ink). I'm constantly rebooting either the printer or my pc to detect the device. I've compared the reliability of the ethernet connection vs. the USB and both are equally unreliable; having to reboot my machine or the printer itself. I wouldn't be complaining about the ink cost, as long as the print quality is good, but no way, print is very blurred and sloppy. I'll never buy a kodak again."
1,Worst printer I've ever owned,"This thing was a nightmare to get working. At first it would communicate wirelessly with my desktop, but not my laptop. Then, after talking to someone in India, it worked for a few minutes with the laptop. Soon after that it wouldn't work with either computer, so I hooked up a cable between it and the laptop. A while after that it wouldn't even work with a cable. I spent hours on the phone with India and never could get it resolved. Finally bought an HP 8600 Plus and it works flawlessly. Setup was easy and I was printing, scanning and copying within an hour. No wonder Kodak is in bankruptcy. I'll never buy another product from them again."
1,Never Buy a Kodak Printer,"I have owned and used, in my home, a Kodak ESP 6150 All-In-One printer for one year. It is costing me much more for ink than did the 10 year old Hewlett Packard g55 ink jet printer it replaced. This in spite of their big advertizing campaign claiming they were the solution to the high expense of ink jet printer ink. Each Kodak ink cartridge is less expensive than the competition but contains much less ink and has to be replaced much more often. I print very little color but the color ink cartridge has to be replaced often anyway. The color heads are ""flushed"" often to keep them clean so color ink is used even when the printing is black only. The printer is automatically shut down and will not print, even black only, unless a color cartridge containing ink is in place. There appears to be no work-around for this aggravating feature. Of course Kodak knew all this when they were designing the machine and their misleading advertizing campaign."
1,"cheaper ink doesn't last = no savings, just frustration","Although the print quality is fine for this printer, the ink lasts for about 30-copies if you are lucky. I'm not talking about pictures - you get about 4 pictures. If you only want blk/wht copies of text, the printer won't work if your color ink is out. That makes this product very expensive to use. The ink for my 4 year old HP made 1 1/2 - 2 reams of text copies before running out, all for about 5 dollars more! It was worth it, now I have to make more trips to the store or keep lots of extra ink on hand which is more costly. Save yourself the frustration, purchase another type of printer or make sure you find out how many copies they promise per ink cartridge before purchasing this printer."
2,Very disappointing,"I have had this printer for a little over a year and it's so bad I'm recycling it instead of even trying to sell it on Craiglist. I wouldn't want someone else to have to deal with the issues that we have had from the beginning. The biggest problem is when printing black/white text pages in draft, normal and sometimes best you get missing letters or partial letters over multiple areas of the page.My husband and I are both in IT and have done all the troubleshooting and read all the tech support information to try to get this to work and used only KODAK ink. So, even if the ink is cheap, if it doesn't print on the page, it's time to put it in the trash. This is the first Kodak pritner we purchased because of the ink savings but it will be the last."
1,Disappointed,"Our organization bought this Kodak printer because the cost of the ink cartridges are so much cheaper and in the long run, the overall cost should have been lower. However, this printer has numerous problems. 1) Very few printings and the black print head is bad. I have contacted Kodak who assured me that the printer was under warranty and numerous emails later, I have not heard back from them. 2) The ink cartridges are cheaper, but they do not last very long. 3) If you run out of EITHER ink, the printer will not print. You may have a full black and an empty color, but you cannot print. It just shuts down. Try your luck with a different printer. That is what I am going to do."
1,I hate this printer,Goes through ink too fast. Uses color ink somehow when I only print black text. Doesn't play well with some of my computers on the network. I wish I hadn't bought this printer.
5,Great Product,This is a great printer for the money. It was very easy to set up with the wireless capability and I had no problem getting 2 desktops and a laptop set up to the printer. It makes copies much faster than the hp printer iused to use and the photo printing is great. Have had no issues and would reccomend to anyone looking to get a great printer that is economical on ink cartridges and user friendly.
2,Kodak ESP 6150 all-in-one printer,"After 2 years it quit !!! The first year it was fine, I really only used it as a copier, and printer. Very disappointed!"
4,Easy to use,"Very easy to set up and use. Wireless function works great. The print quality is good, but not the best."
3,Disappointed a little,"After some very rough treatment getting to me and the shipping box in terrible shape and all four corners crushed on the printer box I went ahead and set the printer up ,it is working with a USB cable not provided, which I am disappointed in.It has no PIc Bridge which is rather unusual with it being from Kodak,you would think that would be the first thing put on every model they make.Cannot get the WI FI to work so I am going to call Kodak support and hopefully get it set up.In all honesty I would go the extra buck and buy the Kodak 9250,wished I would have.The 6150 is a bit pricey with no more options than it has.If I had to do over again I would have purchased the 9250.I am really disappointed in the packaging that Amazon.com did for shipping."
3,Here's a Review,"In the past I have left Pro & Con reviews of products I've purchased. After leaving 'Nice Positive' reviews of things, I started getting unsolicited phone-calls wanting me to participate in 'Consumer Product Ratings' All The Time. SO, it would appear that s-o-m-e-h-o-w my personal info is being 'Sold' to Telemarking SCUM.So, I won't be giving an actual 'review' of this product."
1,AVOID - NO LINUX SUPPORT,don't plan on using this printer with any Linux system - simply amazing that Kodak is incapable of accommodating simple LPD printing via TCP or UNIX spooling systems (CUPS would be preferred)
1,Can't print CD's or DVD's. Other brands do!,"Other ""All in One Printers"" have some method to print directly onto CD/DVD's. This one doesn't, not quite ""All"" in one?"
1,What a waste!,"We had this printer, new for a year, January 2012. It was running ok, most of the time without any real issue until last week. While printing a letter the print cartrige went all the way to the right (under that ledge) and cannot be moved no matter what we do. We call support, to find out what we can do to make it slide back to the middle but that thing is stuck and would not move. Finally, I was told that we need to purchase a new carriage assembly (whatever that is). We wanted to find out if we could just bring it to the 'Geek Squad' and have them fix it well, I was told that this is something that happen every so often with Kodak printers it's a defect. Go figure, this defect had to happen as soon as my warranty expires. I would not feel comfortable recommending this printer to anyone."
1,Do not buy!,"I hate this printer! I rarely use it and its always out if ink! Nothing works when the I have black ink but no color, and even with full ink it only scans half the time and the other half it takes 20minutes then says ""failed"" with no error code. Customer service is beyond horrible (Indian's who only have programed responses, and do not think for themselves to help). I bought it to save on ink, but now im just wasting time and money. I will never buy Kodak again."
1,Refuses to print in black-and-white if color ink is low,"We received this printer last Christmas as a gift. I liked the unit until the color ink cartridge ran low and it REFUSED to print a very important BLACK-AND-WHITE document for me until I replaced the COLOR ink cartridge. It will not print a page of black and white if the color ink cartridge is low. This caused me to make an emergency trip to FedEx Office while I had clients waiting for two copies of an 11 page lease on the other side of town. I almost never print in color so I never care whether my color ink cartridge is low or not.In my opinion, it was unethical of KODAK to design the software to render the printer useless until you buy more of something you don't need- such as color ink cartridges."
1,"Prints OK, Shreds Avery labels better!!!",I purchased the 6150 because I believed Kodak when they stated it could print on Avery labels.It doesn't.What I end up with is a pile of shredded Avery labels as they get handsomely stuck inside and must be pulled out piece by piece.It prints paper fine but at the end of the day I still need a label printer.Rats! Looks like I made the wrong purchase...
1,PRINT HEAD Problems,"I bought a Kodak 6150 all in one printer 1 1/2 years ago because they were rated as one of the lowest cost ink utilization printers. At end of the 1st year it started having printing problems and after trouble shooting it with Kodak they sent me a new Print Head which solved for thge time being.6 months later it is having more problems with the Print Head jamming. When I contacted Kodak Tech support (in a Foreign Country) they told me there was nothing they could do, and to buy a new printer.You may save on ink but if you have to buy a new printer every year or so then the savings go down the toilet.Maybe another reason Kodak went bankrupt!!!Disatisfied in CA."
1,Kodak ESP 6150 All in One,"About a year and half ago I decided to give Kodak a try for our home based business. Within 6 months the print-head had to be replaced by Kodak under warranty, I asked them to take the printer back but was talked into keeping it with the new print head. I had seen on the forums that the ESP 6150 Print Head was not lasting very long. The new warranty replacement I was assured was new and improved... Approximately 9 months later the second print-head with only 2 sets of kodak ink cartridges used began failing again. Well here I am again trying to find another ink jet printer that will provide more than a years service for my money.Buyer beware of the ""Low Ink Cost"" factor in your buying decision..."
1,Will cost you more in the long run,"I loved this printer at first. I thought the ink was cheap, and it seemed reliable. After a couple of months, I found out that it has counters on the ink cartridges, and counts the total number of pages you print, and gives ink status messages based on that. We do almost exclusive black and white printing here, and it still eats color cartridges like crazy. When you factor in the cost of a color ($20) and b&w ($10) cartridge, you are paying $30 to make black and white pages. Not happy. Selling this as soon as I can, and getting a different brand. Also, there is no way to refill the ink, like with other brands (hp, etc.). Their ""cheapest ink"" will cost you more in the long run. Don't buy this printer!"
1,"Three weeks, three calls to customer service.","While this printer has great features, the scanning software is simply broken. Out of the box it required an hour long on-line chat with customer service to remove a piece of Apple software that conflicted with it. Four days later, another chat with customer service to ""restart"" drivers that were disabled by a Windows update. One week later, another chat with customer service to address a disconnection problem.While I appreciate that most other companies don't even provide customer support, the inability of the company to design software that doesn't continually conflict with aspects of the operating system is seriously deficient.The printer constantly jams, misfeeds and in the course of three months has had to have a new printer head.There are much better printers on the market."
1,Have to print first before you can fax,"Wouldn't you expect an ALL in one printer, copier, scanner, FAXto be able to fax directly from your computer. I guess the developersat Kodak couldn't image such a thing. Really???"
1,Don't Buy!!!,"Don't buy this printer. I had it for less than a month when it got a 3802 error code and after talking to Kodak, it needs to have the printhead replaced. I've never had anything like this happen with my HP printers."
5,Great,So far so good. This is for my son in college as we have 1 just like it at home and it works great .
3,"Is ok, a bit flimsy re attachment to chair. Different color.","Item is pictured as bright blue - actually is a nice navy color. Pockets suit purpose but mesh for attaching to chair is almost unusable, breaks easily when trying to 'firm up' attachment to chair."
5,Sofa Arm Organizer,"This product is great. Very easy to put on. No assembly required. My husband uses his on his recliner and he just loves it. He does word puzzles and it holds his books, pens, all his remote controls, nail clippers, sale flyers, cell phone etc. It doesn't slide around, it stays in place.SOFA ARM ORGANIZER"
1,Sofa Organizer disappoints,It was too large for the standard Lazy-Boy arm and the adjusting apparartus was poor.
5,Master,"I can close my eyes and see Lenny playing, it's as though he makes love to his guitar...he goes into another zone. A true master. Knew Lenny........ gone far too soon."
4,Windows 2000 Professional,I found the book to be well laid out and written to allow a wide range of users to understand the operation and configuration of Windows 2000. The examples contained are precise and step by step so that the novice or expert can easily find the path to a well structured operating system in their home or office PC. The forward references found in the initial chapters allow the reader to fast forward to places of special interest or need and delve into the details or specific functions they are searching for. I believe this will be a valuble addition to any Windows 2000 users library.
4,Too academic for me,"I bought this book to help me set up W2000 and get my small network going at my office. I found lots of explanations about what this and that means which is helpful for someone needing more background info. What I needed wasn't easy to find, that is how to actually get my network going. I finally gave up on the book and called MS support and found that I needed to enter a user on both computers to make the peer to peer network work within the security confines of W2000.To summarize, this book is a good reference source but not so useful for actually solving problems in W2000 for the non computer professional."
2,More of a beginner's book,"This book is a beginner's look at Wink2k Professional . There isn't many chapters that really delve in to how Windows 2000 Professional works. For example: Chapter 6 explains how to use Internet Explorer. Well I don't know about you, but I think that anyone who is using the NT version of windows would know how to use ie. Peter Norton should stick to creating great anti-virus software."
5,basic stitch book,"Definitely an important stitch collection book. Should be on every serious knitter's bookshelf; I've owned it for years. Chapters organized by country: Arabic, Spanish, Italian and French, German and Austrian, Dutch, Scandinavian, Fair isle and Shetland, British Isles, and Fishermen's sweaters. Most patterns are written out but charts where more helpful. b&w photos for all stitches."
4,"Traditional Knitting Patterns from Scandinavia, the British Isles, France, Italy","Hmmm...how to describe this book. It's usual in the sense that I have seen many of the patterns in other knitting books (this is very common) but it is UNusual in the sense that the author clumps the patterns based on where they originated. It's an interesting book, but not one I'm interested in purchasing for my knitting library (I checked it out through my local library).The contents include:1. Arabic Knitting2. Spanish Knitting3. Italian and French Knitting4. German and Austrian Knitting5. Dutch Knitting6. Scandinavian Knitting7. Fair Isle and Shetland Knitting8. British Isles Knitting"
3,For the (Mostly) Experienced,"This is a book for truly serious and somewhat gifted knitters. I would call it academic/technical/historical (uninspired.) The ""color"" work patterns have been charted, but the lace and Aran patterns are written, making them more difficult to follow for those who have learned the newer charting method.If you have a knitting library deep in technique and patterns, this book is a required, if less than interesting, addition. All the photos are black and white.It takes a creative imagination to use these patterns in designing knitwear."
2,"Muzak, agreed...","The melodies are pretty enough, but they are played on modern synthesizers with electric guitars in the background. If you want a CD of traditional-sounding chinese music, *don't* buy this one. If you don't care (the music *is* nice), go for it. I wanted a traditional sound, though, so am very disappointed with this CD."
1,This is one AWFUL CD!,"I saw this CD at a music store in my local mall. I thought that perhaps its incredibly low price was simply because of the fact that it was Chinese, so I bought it. When I listened to it, I practically passed out from an overexposure to cheezy elevator music! I would honestly only reccomend this CD if you are an Asian restaurant owner who is desperately in need of some background music. NOT RECCOMENDED FOR ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES!"
2,Chinese Elevator music,"Hoping to get a compilation of traditional Chinese music, I ordered this CD. The content amounts to over an hour playing time of the kind of easy-listening music that is played in some Chinese restaurants. Pleasant, easy on the ears, but by no means ""traditional"" Chinese music. Think of it as Asian Muzak."
1,How to Cheat At Golf,"I was under the impression that I was ordering a NEW book. This book has definitely been used. The binding is worn, the corner of the book is bent and the pages look old. This was supposed to be a birthday present, and will not be given as one."
1,This was a total joke!!,"First of all, the songs on the discription don't match the songs on the CD. The songs are live music recordings from a crowd singing in a german beer tent and it has nothing to do with the actuall songs claimed on the CD. Maybe a non-german speaker, who does not have the sightest clue how the songs are supposed to sound, could be fooled by this CD. Second, not even the melodies fit to the names of the songs! This CD is just a plain disappoinmet!"
1,poor quality,I purchased this shirt and promptly returned this item. The shirt was constructed with the seams sewn on the side of the shirt that displayed the screen print.
2,Merchant sizing runs too small,"I returned the shirt. The quality of the image was good. However, the shirt was very, very thin. Also, I followed the merchant's recommendations for sizing for myself and ordered a medium. The shirt was almost too small to put over my head. If you decide to get the shirt you may want to go a size up."
2,Only useful in a very quiet place,"Very cute design and easy to use. But, the output of the speakers is so low that you can only hear them if there is no ambient noise. Can't be heard in a car, or outside if cars go by, or even in a room with ambient noise. Look at the wattage before you buy."
4,Good ol workout,"Ok I think it is funny how many people complained about this old school but very effective workout. I loved it 10 years ago and I love it today! Michelle and Tracey are a great inspiration and this is sort of where they started. YES it is challenging but if you popped a dvd in and could do every move immediately think of how bored you would get. People- did you ever hear of doing something consistently until you mastered it? This is a workout you should grow into. The moves are there to let you have fun and not get bored so easliy. If you can't do the moves march in place until you pick them up again. Also this is great for working up a sweat and a nice afterburn too! Yes the costumes are hilarious and the moods are overly perky and campy but it is such a good work out you can forget your troubles have a good time and think, ""my have times changed,"" while you work your thighs and hips into oblivion."
3,Good intermediate workout---warning about knee injury!,"***If you have bad knees, this is NOT a good video! I have had knee problems for many years and even underwent physical therapy to help strengthen it...This video has a very grueling on the knees toning/lunge workout which really is strenuous on the knees.I enjoyed 2 of the 3 instructors, but didn't like the studio quality of the video. Everything they said and every hair they brushed back seened to be written in advance and memorized even though they're trying to pretend like they're doing the entire workout for the first time you can tell they've done it all a billion times and it leaves me feeling frustrated with the instructors.The work out is good for the intermediate level (not a beginner's video), though there isn't very much arm toning (to be expected of a lower body tape of course).I did this tape for a few weeks and then set it aside. Even with my knee brace on it's too tough on my weaker knee."
1,"2000 is very misleading, this video was shot in 1994!!!","Okay, so the faster and harder the workout is doesn't mean that it is better for you. Here's a riddle, How many moves does it take to confuse someone? Seriously, this video incorporates very advanced, confusing moves, and is not well produced at all. There are three rejects from the 80's giving you absolutely no instruction and no cues then expect you to be a professional dancer and follow their antics for an hour. They move from one thing to the next without the slightest bit of notice.Definately an advanced workout also. Maybe after viewing the tape 5 or 6 times you could learn the moves, but by that time you're puking over their perky hairdoos and attitudes. Yuck! Save your money, or better yet, buy a serious workout video by Leslie Sansone to lose that weight and get in shape."
4,Keep trying -- this one's worth it!,"Yes, it's fast-paced. Yes, it takes a little practice before you get all the steps down. But keep at it -- this is one of the best exercise videos I have ever used! We've all been to aerobics class before, and the moves can get to be pretty boring after a while. But this workout is different. It's the challenge of the routines that keeps me coming back morning after morning. And the toning section -- it provides the best results these hips and thighs have ever seen! I'd recommend this video to anyone looking for an exercise routine that will keep them coming back each day!"
2,Awesome Toning Exercises BUT Terrible Aerobic Workout,"I think the toning section of this video is great and very Challenging... BUT the low-impact aerobic section is aweful! The instructors are using fancy moves and changing the moves so quickly. The instructors don't show you how to do the moves. I found this hard to keep up with. When I was finally finished the aerobic workout I didn't feel as if I worked out, because I had to constantly return to the basic step. The aerobic section of this video should have been basic and not so fancy. Therefore I would not recommend this video to anyone unless you're an experienced aerobic instructor. LOL. ((Recommend ""Fat Burning Workout for Dummies Video"" for low-impact fat burning))"
2,Not what I expected,"I've followed Matthew Paul Turner's blog for about a year and I bought this book before that but I finally got around to reading ""The Christian Culture Survival Guide"" last weekend.This book is mildly humourous and I think Turner does capture some of the peculiarities within the Christian subculture (such as his guide about the Christian guys and girls one will see at church).I am by no means a fundamentalist nor do I agree with a lot of things fundamentalists preach, but I think Turner is a bit too dismissive of orthodox theology. He provides some ""key verses"" in each chapter but I would hesitate to take his advice on several matters.This book could've also been a lot longer."
3,Funny--but only in spots,"The evangelical Christian subculture is indeed ripe for lampooning. This book is hit and miss in that regard. To be honest, it could have been funnier. Sometimes the author climbs up on his soapbox and starts sermonizing. My advice is: pick your method. I think the shallowness of much of the Christian subculture could be emphasized so much better by a consistently humorous approach. What should provoke belly-laughs just provokes half-smiles.As usual, in a book such as this, the sex chapter is the best one. On the other hand, maybe I say that just because I'm a normal man with all the normal proclivities. If you have a chance to read the book, go ahead, because it's a quick read, but don't knock yourself out. Marginal thumbs up."
1,Not what I hoped for. . .,"I have read several other books from this same publishing company, and the majority of them have been excellent. With this book I was expecting (based on advertisements, real reliable, I know) a book filled with witty, saterical observations, yet holding warm insights and encouragment to sort through this culture of Test-a-mints and Maranatha Music to get to the real Jesus and not the hokey version we see what too much of these days. Ya, it wasn't that at all. It was full of bitterness and just plain bad advice (like encouraging church hopping and not commiting), not to mention the childhood stories of a kid growing up in a very weird, not normal ""christian"" culture. Like, TV Movie soap opera kind of weird. I am pretty dissappointed with this book."
1,ironic....,"Yeah, this book was humorous for the first chapter, until the author's sarcasm became overwhelming, what I would call full-blown arrogance and hypocrisy. First of all, if you intend to write a whole book centered on ridiculing people for their faults, *AND* claim to follow Christ, something's wrong. Jesus' command to love one another includes everyone--even those insane fundamentalist, Bible-thumping freaks you come across. There is such a thing as constructive criticism (which is not used here).What cinched it for me was the irony of sneaking an ad for their magazine at the end of the book. After all that ranting on Christianity becoming a giant sales pitch? Come on now, he should've known better. That was the funniest part, in MY opinion.I'm going back to the bookstore and returning it. I guess he may have started with good intentions, but somewhere along the way lost the concept of Jesus' love and grace."
1,Disappointing,"I was only impressed with a few of the songs on this CD. If you are looking for timeless classics, then you will be disappointed to find songs like Gloria. Lyrics are not included in the liner notes, which may disappoint anyone trying to learn Italian. The sound quality of this CD is not impressive, but it is inexpensive."
1,Not as expected...,"I was disappointed by this CD. The quality of the recording is poor, and the music itself isn't anything to write home about."
2,"Another ... from the ""all the best from"" series","Almost as bad as the Israel installation in this series, at least this CD has somewhat better sound. The most interesting thing about this disc are the pop tunes rather than the more traditional song tracks. I kind of liked the Italian version of Gloria. Although this CD is really destined to become another drink coaster, I can at least copy the few tunes I liked onto a recordable CD..."
1,A bike rider from Maryland,"Save your money and buy MS Streets & Trips 2004 if you are looking for a good road mapping program. I use mapping software to plan bike rides that range from 25 to 100 miles in length. I used to swear by the Street Atlas program, at least up through Version 9. Now I find myself swearing at the newest versions such as 2004, which has what can only be described as a ""clunky"" user interface that does not support wide carraige printing and contains errors in the routing of roads here in Maryland that have been changed years ago. If MS Streets and Trips can get these roads right, why can't Street Atlas."
2,Look Elsewhere,"This software is a genuine POS! I purchased this based upon a recomendation from someone who used previous releases of this product, I guess Delorme lost thier way for the 2004 release, terrible user interface, no documentation to help get you started, very innacurate unless you create a stop point at every intersection, which kind of defeats the purpose of the software! I played with it for 2 hrs and could not get an accurate route from NY to Wash DC. I purchased Microsofts Streets & trips the following day, it was cheaper $19.95 after rebates, and far easyer to use whith minimal user input! I'll try using delorme again, It has a few features MS doesnt have, But in my opinion it is just too difficult for the average user."
1,"Cumbersome to load, then doesn't work","I recently purchsed this SA USA 2004. Not only was I not able to load this on my computer using all of the instructions included in the case (I had to go to a support site for secret installation instructions). Finally after jumping through the several hoops, I was succesful in getting the program to open.However, none of the finding or routing features work.It is not as though I have an exotic computer configuration.(a Dell Dimension 8200 w/2.0G Pentium IV and 512MB ram with Windows XP.This software is so full of bugs I can't believe that Delorme, who I thought to be reputable could have released it."
1,Delorme Street Farce 2004,"The actual product name is ""Delorme Street Atlas 2004 USA"". I checked out Dallas-Fort Worth because I had a business meeting there. Sad thing about it - they completely left out the George Bush Tollway! They didn't show it ""under construction"" even. Topo 4.0 was a great product, but it's getting a little out of date now. Too bad - because my brand spanking new Street Atlas is missing data! Get your act together, guys..I'm getting my money back."
2,DeLorme StreetAtlas 2004,"I find DeLorme Street Atlas 2004 to be a marginally useful program. Although I have used it and its predecessor versions for several years, its idiosyncratic user interface is a constant source of irritation. I might feel differently if I used the program frequently enough to learn it well, but for occasional use it is quite non-intuitive and many of its features are both hard to find and difficult to use. For instance, the method of saving map notations and routes is so obscure as to be almost worthless. For finding simple directions, an on-line mapping service like Map Quest is both far easier and faster, although Street Atlas printed maps are better. I have bought upgrades over the years and have few complaints about the quality of DeLorme's mapping database, but Street Atlas the program should be an embarrassment to them; it badly needs a major redesign"
2,Street Atlas 2004 is not too good,"I got this from Amazon for $49.99 + free shipping - now I see its lower. The Thomas Guide is not available for my area, so the main reason I wanted this was to make an atlas of the area where I live. First problem is that it boots up very very slowly. But the main problem is that it doesnt show names for all streets like regular maps do - and it doesnt show any street numbers like Thomas Guides do. I printed up several maps but I would never use these to replace my regular folding map. But THAT was the main reason I bought this. I havent used it to find an address and I expect that it does that OK. But then there is always Mapquest for that. One consolation is that at least the price was right = I got it free from SBC. (Disclaimer: SBC sent me a $50 credit/debit card and I used it to get this softwhere.)--Doug"
2,Bring back Street Atlas 9,"I think I owned every version of the old DeLorme Street Atlas program that came out, from 3.0 on to 9.0. They were the finest mapping programs ever made -- fast, intuitive, accurate. Then DeLorme decided to ""improve"" it. Gone were the easy-to-use Windows menus and in their place were the most confusing collection of tabs and buttons I have ever seen. I swore I would never buy USA 2004 but my old SA9.0 was getting so out of date. My mistake. I would gladly pay twice the price of Street Atlas USA 2004 for a copy of Street Atlas 10.0. But it was never made.I would have given this program a zero, but the maps are up-to-date and accurate and, if you've never used the old DeLorme Street Atlas, well maybe this one will look okay to you."
3,Not really specific advice.,"This book was interesting reading but not really practical, specific advice on dealing with depression. The writer is English and her story, especially regarding treatment in England, is not always similar to our treatment. The book is somewhat slow and vague, would not highly recommend it."
1,A Rip-Off,"Steer clear of this product. I bought System Mechanic to solve what should have been a couple of simple issues -- and ended up spending HOURS getting my Win XP system put back into usable shape. This product is not at all what it claims to be...it is not thought out, the interface is fast and loose -- which for an application that gets into the guts of a system is very dangerous. I have not gotten the tech support they advertise...still waiting for them to respond to a trouble ticket. This is really a bad, bad product. It doesn't even come close to what the maker claims it can do and what it does do, it does badly. Worse than a waste of the purchase price because of the time it will take you to undo the mess it makes and if you don't have good backups, you are toast."
1,mechanic 4,Too cumbersome. Duplicates many of my other software and when compressing my hard drive failed.
4,It has problems but what doesn't,"I had some problems. But once I learned exactly what I was doing and to PAY attention to it, no big. The panda software went screwy, so stopped using it. Defrag was just stupid. But I love the disc scrub matter of fact it is great! My husband has contact 2 virus on his computer, normal means weren't working so i scrubbed his drive (it erases all of it) killed it both times. The memory buttons are great when you start running slow. And it finds stuff, not always stuff you want it to find! But you can go into options and tell it to avoid certain files! I love it, but it gets a 4 since it does have problems..."
1,very poor program,"I have not attempted to determine exactly why this program is so bad...all I know is that it messed with my registry and I needed to re-boot numerous times in order to run....If not for 'System Restore' on my XP OS, I'd still be frozen. Don't waste your dollars."
2,Not so good at all.,"If hard core Indian Classical is what you're looking for, don't look here. It is all Indian folk music and dance drama. The music can get borring and is not lyrical and expressive like most Indian classical. Also, the recording is not very good, It sounds like a child's tape recorder was used. The absence of a booklet is also frustrating. I would have liked to know who the artists were, and what instruments were used. Overall, I thought it was a dissapointment, and if you ask me it is certainly not ""all the best from India""."
3,all the best from India,This is a collection of various classical and spiritual music from some parts of India. It is very soothing to listen.
2,Kathakali patukelkkan,"I want to hear good kathakali music by some by some well known ponnanis such as Kalamandalam Sankaran Embrandiri, Kalamandalam Unnikrishnan, or Kalamandalam Hyderali, or Haridas"
1,THE MERMAID,"I DON'T KNOW WHY ANYONE INCLUDING CHILDREN WOULD GIVE THIS BOOK 5 STARS. THE DRAWINGS ARE PLAIN, COMMON, UNEXCEPTIONAL. THE STORY IS THE SAME. IT'S NOT EVEN A GOOD STORY FOR SMALL CHILDREN."
1,Horrid,"H.R.F Keating is a grandmaster of English mystery writing, but never one of my favorites. Reginald Hill or Peter Lovesey are much more my cup of tea. Even so this is a horrid book.When I purchase a mystery novel, I expect a puzzle and procedural, not this tiresome diatribe on love and lust, Amor and Eros and other twaddle. It is impossible to concentrate on the crime, for all the boring, repetative nonsense about the lead detective Det. Superintendant Harriet Martens love troubles. And her gasbag of a husband, who cant say a simple sentence without sounding like a dictionary doesn't help.Maddening book."
5,nice product from top to bottom,"the glass is perfect and will adjust by moving and positioning ... the weighted base is super fine ...in all, this was a great purchase to handle all those tedious moments when you want your hands free to highlight an object under magnification ...very pleased."
2,Disappointment,"This is NOT a good book for a beginner in Knitted lace.I am an experienced knitter but have not knitted lace for years - I was once fairly expert, I earned pocket money while a medical student by knitting circular Shetland lace baby shawls to order. Even so, I found this book of little use in getting back into this area.There are virtually no general instructions and the layout of the patterns is unnecessarily complicatedTry Jan Eaton's book instead"
4,finishing is not clear,I loved the book. It took many tries to knit with crochet thread. I thought the directions for the crochet edgingshould have been more detailed.
2,Good,I would rate this a five but I was looking for the pufurme in that bottle but they sent me the new one which is not the one I was looking for
2,versus by versace,"I didn't receive the one named above, the bottle I recieved was purple not red as I order so ordering from you again I don't know. The fragrance is not the same as the red bottle."
4,Nate's Rview,"I was a bit disappointed with this book because there was not as much action as in most other Star Wars books.Twelve-year-old Obi -Wan is an exceptional student at the Jedi Temple, although his anger sometimes clouds his judgment. Only a few more weeks until his thirteenth birthday and then forced to leave the Temple, he has one last chance to be a padawan. When Jedi Master Qui-Gon-Jin arrives, Obi-wan is hopeful. Unfortunately, Qui-Gon is skeptical and rejects Obi-Wan. Though Fate has placed them on a same trip to Bandomear, Obi-Wan is to farm and Qui-Gon is on a mission.I would only recommend this book to Star Wars fans because you have to know who a lot of people are such as Master Yoda and Master Windu. Other than that, it is a fairly good book."
4,mth,"This book did not really appeal to me. It was OK but the rest of the series were much better, action wise. Also check out the Jedi Quest series for more action."
5,"At last, and SW book that DOESN""T SUCK!!!!!!","I was discouraged when I first saw this book on the shelf. ""Oh please,"" I thought. ""I can't believe that the SW book franchise is already delving into (and possibly ruining) ""The Phantom Menace."" Still, my friend let me borrow it. I read both books withing thirty-six hours! What makes these books so wonderful and different from other SW novels is that the characters are given so much depth and emotion. The outward conflicts in the book are exciting and well-crafted, but not nearly as well-crafted as the conflicts raging within the characters. I feel that these books rightfully belong in the hands of any Star Wars fan. By the way, I'm sixteen. These books deserve higher status than RL 4."
5,"PadawanGirl,13","Great! Wonderful! Anything positive a book can be! A book all star wars fans have to read! I loved it. My favorite book out of all the star wars books so far, and I have read a lot. I liked it better then Heir to the Empire. I you call yourself a star wars fan, then you must read it."
4,not bad at all....,"For a children's novel, I found myself pleasantly surprised with this book. After Episode I I was anxious for any new stories from the prequel universe. It gives good insight into the history of Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon, but several parts, including the ending, were rather rushed and thus a bit disappointing. I also couldn't stand the font the text was in; after a while it became hard to read. But there was plenty of action, and overall a good read."
5,"Simple, yet a masterpiece...","I know this is a book intended for children, but I am 19 and I enjoyed it more than a lot of other Star Wars books. The entire series is fantastic. I am now reading the fifth book, and every book is better than the last."
4,Gripping. Edge of the seat stuff.,"I admit, when I picked up this book in the store I was a bit wary of it being for ""junior"" readers. However, it turned out to be a real page-turner. It had me hooked - wondering at what point (and under what circumstances) Qui-gon would finally accept Obi-wan as his padawan. When I got to the end of the book it had still not happened (plus the mysterious Xanatos character that was hinted at) I just HAD to read the next one......."
5,I liked how they showed Obi-Wan getting his start,It was a pretty good book. Dave Wolverton did a great job with Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon. It was surprising to see Obi-Wan had a temper.
5,"A ""Must-Read"" for Obi-Wan fans!!!","Love Star Wars? Crave for backround on Obi-Wan? Then this is the book for you! I read this book in a matter of 3 days, I couldn't put it down! Tons of action, adventure, mystery, and emotion fill each and every page of this amazing book. It explains how Obi-Wan learns to control his anger and fear while making new friends, facing dufficlut tasks, and hard consqunces. I just can't wait until I get my hands on the second book in the series!"
5,Great start to a GREAT series!,"I read this about I year ago, and have since read all of them and I am now awaiting the Special Edition to come UPS! Anyway, I love Obi-Wan in this book, cause he is just sooo cool (He is ALWAYS cool!) Obi-Wan is my fav character and I am SO in love with him! This book has so much adventure and action, ...! It is sooo fast-paced, you won't be able to put it down until you finish it! (Which won't take very long!) Don't miss this great and worthy addition to the greatest saga in the world, STAR WARS!"
2,Not impressed for the money,I received the product in the mail today. I was disappointed with the quality. The door for the battery cover just feels cheap and it felt like it would be broken off by pushing it into place after putting the batteries in the device. Upon turning the unit on it would only shoot a laser one direction...to the right. The directions say to push the on/off button twice to activate the plumb line. This did not work. I have already sent the item back and exchanged it for a much cheaper (in price) Stanley 77-154 SP5 FatMax Five Beam Laser Kit. I am starting to realize that price does not equate quality. It stinks because I was looking forward to using this product for a project this weekend. Looks like I will have to hold off for a bit till the Fat Max gets here. Honestly the finish of the product was disappointing for the price. I was initially only looking for a laser plumb. I stumbled upon this and thought it might be nice to have. Oh well...live and learn.
3,This is Just the Beginning,"If you know nothing about Systems Theory, this book could whack you on the side of the head. In six short chapters it gives you a background on Systems Thinking, covers two main concepts, and then explains how these concepts can be expanded. It is studded with amazing, real life examples of these concepts at work in the world.The reader should be aware that this is more of a pamphlet covering just a couple concepts very thoroughly rather than a complete treatise on Systems Thinking. It is meant to be used as a guide to teach children about the basic concepts of Systems Thinking. For these reasons this book can be skimmed by adults. It is the first of five books in a series, meant to be digested in order. The others may increase in complexity. (I have yet to find them.) Listed on the inside the front cover, they are: ""Environmental Systems"", ""Modeling and Systems Design"", ""Forecasting Systems' Performance"" and ""Application of Systems Theory""."
4,"We've been dumbed-down so long it looks like ""up"" to us!","As the introductory text to MIT's Sloan School of Management ""Systems Dynamics in Education Process"" you know that some ""thought"" has been given to its choice to begin that auspicious project. This booklet gives in terms simple to understand the preliminaries of ""systems dynamics"" needed to continue the ""Roadmaps"" series (currently at nine chapters) into the computer modeling of systems or to just understand the world around you. You'll want to compare this booklet with Daniel Kim's ""Introduction to Systems Thinking"" in the Pegasus Communications ""Innovations in Management"" Series!"
3,Not My Cup of Tea but May Be for Others,"The intro about depression and anxiety was very interesting although quite brief and less comprehansive than the product description led me to believe. If I were newer to the yoga scene, I may have found the sequence interesting. The product description did mention vinyasa but that is used so broadly these days that it did not occure to me that the sequence would start with Sun Salutations right off the bat like in the tradational Astanga tradition. While the presenter is very knowledgeable, I found his voice a bit distracting and the sequence fairly routine, i.e. I could have gone to a local gym for the same rather then purchased this DVD. If you love a rigorous vinyasa practice, I think you will like this DVD. If you don't, or don't want one often, I don't think this is the DVD for you."
3,not for beginners,Not for beginners. I bought this for a 75 year old female that had no yoga experience. She just could not do it...too much up and down off the floor.
2,Dislike,"I am very open minded, but I found this to be uncomfortable. I can't relax or feel calm when I'm so uncomfortable the entire time. I also found the instructor a little on the cheesy side. I didn't get more than 5 minutes into the workout. I completely agree with the theory however. Depression and Anxiety can't exist without our permissions."
2,"Started to use, lost interest","I started to use this DVD, but quickly lost interest. I think the video quality is a bit less than I was expecting, and I couldn't do, or keep up with the pace of the poses, to save my life! Might be helpful to add to the title ""Yoga for Depressed and Anxious but Nimbly Flexible People""."
2,Very Misleading,"Yoga for anxiety and depression? Hardly. It feels like your basic everyday power yoga class. An hour and a half of holding somewhat challenging poses, which does boost your endorphins ultimately resulting in that yoga buzz, but that's all it is. Nothing specifically geared towards altering your perception of the world or helping with anxiety or depression-- false advertising. I felt cheated after this practice. It was horrible sound quality, music, and setting. Even though it was a good workout, if I'm doing a basic practice, I would much rather use a dvd that has a variety of routines so that on busy days I could still manage to fit yoga in. I got the ""yoga for stress relief"" dvd with Barbara Benagh as well, and THAT is actually really helpful for anxiety."
2,Misleading Title,"This is just a standard routine with a decent instructor and one very limber student. This is something that you may well enjoy, but I'm afraid that the ""anxiety and depression"" title was chosen to generate sales, not because of the content. Also, the video quality is just short of professional."
2,Yoga for Disappointment,Nothing new here. All your standard yoga poses. This was filmed in a an empty studio space that caused annoying echoing - especially when the instructor was moving in the poses. I was bothered by the background music. It really grated on the nerves after a while. The routine was quite long (over 1 1/2 hours). I prefer yoga dvds that offer a choice of routines. I don't always have 2 hours to dedicate to my practice and it would be nice to have a shorter option. I don't understand how the ratings could be so high. I should've paid more attention to the other low ratings. Amazed there are only a couple.
2,I was disappointed.,"I received this DVD hoping it would be a valuable tool. I have read Amy Weintraub's ""Yoga for Depression"" which is excellent. This DVD is actually not on target in explaining the use of Yoga to help people with depression. It does teach a nice routine of asanas, but there are much better DVDs available for that. The sound is also not done professionally. I would not recommend this DVD for the reason that the title is very misleading."
5,Yoga for Depression and Anxiety DVD,I have been doing yoga for about 20 years and was somewhat aware of its mental and physical benefits. I am a Clinical Psychologist and assumed that yoga was helpful in producing a general sense of well being. Ira Israel is the first yoga teacher I have experienced to explain and teach the benefits of yoga for Depression and Anxiety. His yoga sessions like his DVD demonstrate and explain the poses in a careful and thoughtful manner so that any level of participant will benefit from them. I highly recommend the DVD trainer for anyone who is wanting to improve their positive outlook on life and lessen their anxiety and stress. Mr. Israel provides a clear connection between the practices of yoga and the psychological benefits they provide.
1,it sucks!!!!,"I wasted money on something that is supposed to help me with my anxiety and this has nothing that actually helps!!! No meditation, no helpful suggestions.....nothing!!! This dvd sucks!!!!"
5,So Enlightening!,"Wonderful, mesmerizing....truly a wake up call so necessary in these sad times of depression and anxiety....Hope is rising, Peace is coming!"
1,One word Horrible,"I am learning the hard way that rave reviews of a product cannot be counted on. This was a horrible DVD. Its for anxiety and depression. He mentions one time that I can remember that doing a pose (can't remember which) should make you stop thinking like that (in reference to depression). Its done in an unattractive studio with the teacher and one women in some wild yoga pants (which I like, but didn't find appropriate for this). There is some chanting going on in the background which is annoying. Its just sun salute after sun salute, with so many chattarangas (not sure if that's the correct spelling) and down dogs I lost count. Nothing creative, interesting, or helpful. Sun salutes I can do on my own."
3,nothing remarkably different about this video,"Pros: The verbal instruction is good and the video shows the moves from two views/angles which is helpful.Cons: Production value is low. The 3 pieces of equipment hanging on the wall behind them is distracting. Although it is called ""Yoga for Depression and Anxiety"" the narrator states from the beginning that all yoga is good for depression and anxiety. I found nothing remarkably different about this video than other relaxation yoga videos offer."
5,Best Way to Start a Day,This video was amazing. I love to start the day doing yoga but even on the days that I don't have time I can do deep breathing while listening to the introduction and I feel like it puts everything into perspective.
5,it works!,"This is a great video that really works. Ira Israel brings meaning, calm and insight into this crazy world. Highly recommended."
1,Terrible Quality,"I ordered this DVD when I saw that it had so many 5-star ratings. I was very disappointed. I have done many yoga DVDs and this was one of the worst ones that I've ever done. The sound quality was very poor and the instructor's voice was very mumbled. He also tended to ramble on about useless information which was annoying because I had to concentrate so hard to try to figure out what he was saying. I didn't know if what he was saying was related to the yoga positions or just rambling. The loud, repetitive music did not help the situation. The video quality was also very poor and grainy so it was difficult to see what was going on. This would not be a good video for beginners. The moves were not well explained. The instructor would just name a position and you were expected to do it. The video is also very hard on the shoulders because of the prolonged and repeated holding of ""downward dog"". The video is also extremely long. There is not an option to do a shorter version."
1,Music is annoying,"After reading several reviews, I looked forward to the arrrival of this DVD with great anticipation. It sounded like just what I was looking for in a yoga routine. Ira Israel is a knowledgeable teacher with a wonderful demeanor and voice.Unfortunately if you are looking for a healthy way to combat depression, this may not be it. Not too many people have 75 minutes a day to devote to the practice of Yoga. Even of you do, the music or should I say, a violation of your peaceful surroundings, is so horrible that words escape me. Even though I tried, I cannot make it through a complete session due to the music and there is no way to silence it as on similar DVDs. Wish I had my money back!"
1,Yoga for Depression and anxiety,This DVD is horrible. It is not like the traditional yoga dvd's. The guy talks to you the entire time about how to do a pose and it is in a gym. It echoes and to watch it every time you would like to would be nauseating!
2,Not suitable for all levels,I could not beleive that this was a programme for all levels! It would be a lovely class for me but I did not regard it as suitable for people who might be beginners. I did not feel it addressed the specifics of anxiety and depression. I was very disappointed despite recognising the skill of teh teacher and the student.
2,yoga for anxiety and depression,I really don't like this at all. I don't see that any of the postures have anything special that would relieve anxiety and/or depression. This yoga program is no better than any other and not much different to any other.There are a hundred better yoga DVDs out there to buy.
2,This DVD is nothing more than a general Hatha yoga DVD,"The sequencing presented in the DVD is just like the normal program for the general public. It did not explain why poses are chosen or sequenced in a way that is appropriate for people who suffer from depression. Yoga for depression should be focused more bringing inward experience, self awareness and introspection into tthe practice so that clients can differentiate the difference between reality and their interpretations of their thoughts. The DVD, however, did not address that at all."
3,"Great music, but the practice is lacking.","I loved the music in this video it was great and there was a long and enjoyable restoration session at the end of the video. There are some con's I felt that this session while relaxing can get boring and some of the moves begin to feel repetitive. After the fourth Sun Salutation I began to feel my energy and enjoyment waning. Also, the setting in which the class took place can sort of undermine the feeling the teacher is trying to get across. It seemed cluttered and there was an echo in the room I would have preferred a more serene setting or maybe something outdoors. Overall, I was disappointed with what could have been a great Yoga session."
5,Best Yoga Video!,"I feel this video was one of the best I have found for instruction at home. Ira may not go into too much depth on why each pose is beneficial to anxiety or depression but ALL yoga benefits anxiety and depression....don't give up or listen to your mind telling you that you can't do it! At first, yes, it is just doing poses, but something will click, just don't give up! Also, some have talked about the quality of the video, when you do this series with him a few times you will not have to watch but to only listen to his voice and yourself, which makes it worth the while. The flow is fluent, which I like so much! If anything in this video or any in any kind of yoga is challenging...it is probably because you need that challenge in your life! That is what I have truly learned and have over-came anxiety and depression! Keep going, and find a class to do locally, yogis are everywhere! This is a great video for home practice for beginners to intermediate for sure! Good Luck!"
5,modern yogi,"I've taken Ira's class and I find it exhilarating and yet calm. He takes into account student personal physical challenges and to practice ahimsa (non-injury) - you may choose to do, not do or modify the pose. He's kind, humorous and well-versed in the teachings of yoga as a physical, mental and spiritual practice."
5,Finally!,It is about time that someone created a serious and useful yoga program for people suffering from anxiety and depression. This DVD not only encourages those in need to try something new but guides them into the process with care and understanding. May it reach the thousands in need who are out there.
5,recommended by yoga teachers,"I am a yoga teacher who has been recommending this DVD to all my students who suffer from anxiety and depression, and they have been reaping the benefits. I've had the good fortune to meet with Ira in person and he is a deeply caring compassionate educated and inspired soul, as comes through in this DVD. I trust him and i trust his work. Facing these issues is challenging by definition, and I've been told that it gets very tempting to stop watching it part way through. If that happens to you, re-watch whatever scene it is that has you want to stop because there may be an important message there for you.If are really ready to invest the time and energy to take your mental health into your own hands, get this DVD, and watch it all the way through every day for at least one week. There is no better investment you could make."
2,Great DVD,The instructor is fantastic and the content is awesome but if you watch it on a big screen (like I did) then the image is a little grainy and the camerawork is a little shaky.
3,"Good practice for strong, healthy, experienced yoga students","I found this video thoughtful and professional. I've been a teacher in Northern Calif. for ten years. The presentation of the video is professional, the application is fairly practical for an average, reasonably healthy person. But I honestly can't recommend this video to my beginning, older or injured students because it would be too difficult. This is a good video for people who already have a strong practice.A true yoga therapy approach is to meet with a therapist one-on-one and develop a personalized practice. There are actual breathing exercises, postures, chants, visualizations and meditations that can address anxiety and depression that a long-time experienced yoga therapist can help you with (Krishnamacharya Healing Yoga Foundation or Gary Kraftsow are good resources), versus a general asana practice. Lifestyle and diet must be taken into consideration as well."
5,Definitely helped me,"I took Ira's ""Yoga and Mindfulness for Authentic Happiness"" class in Santa Barbara a few weeks ago and then I watched all of his videos. Firstly, he's much better in person. I mean, the videos are very good but he was much more real, caring, and compassionate in the class. The yoga series he led us through was the same on the video and it definitely made me feel better. His talk about depression and anxiety in the beginning are awesome! For people who are looking to get off of medication and find a healthy alternative I think you should try this video."
3,Didn't Meet Expectations,"If you are a beginner to yoga like me, I would search for something a little more instructive. As the video progressed, the yoga became difficult for me so I don't feel like I got much out of it. It was, however, very calming and soothing."
3,Not as expected,"For a more calming sequence of asanas, this was a more vigorous practice. Instruction was good,but the sound quality had an echo."
5,Great asana series - really works!,A truly great creative flow. Loved the sequencing and loved the explanations of why each asana follows. Very thought provoking. Ira is both knowledgeable and groovy :-)
1,Buyer beware!,"This DVD is a joke. It has nothing to do with depression and anxiety, minus Ira's introductions about how it is stemmed from expectations and something about capitalism. The sound and picture quality are poor. Ira's voice echos badly, and the camera is shaky. The whole thing is not relaxing, like one might presume. I hate to be suspicious, but who would possibly give this DVD 5 stars? This would be a somewhat quality video if it were free, but at 20 dollars it's a scam. Save your money, look elsewhere."
3,It's Not For Beginners,"Even though I've taken yoga for years, I found this DVD definitely not for beginners or even those at an intermediate level. I was hoping to share it with a friend who has never done yoga, but I don't think she could do it. It lacked some very basic reminders such as listening to your body and not working toward pain."
2,The Misguided Historian,"The reason I titled my review of the River God as 'The Misguided Historian' is simple.The writer, in my opinion, overtly misleads the reader of true Ancient Egyptian culture. The writer failed to do his homework. There is ample amount of anthropological science and findings that has been omitted. If ever this book is made into a movie, I will boycott it and Pickett it!I borrowed the book from the local Library."
2,Not my cup of tea after all,"This might be a good book, but the homosexual-pedophile rape of slave-boys by Lord Intef (pp.39-40) just turned my stomach. I'm surprised nobody has commented on this.I've read far worse material, for example ""The Rape of Nanking,"" which has the dis-privilege of being documented history. But I'ld rather save the gruesome details for a history/ethics lesson than my leisurely weekend read."
1,River Guru !,"River Guru!Taita the super slave as one reviewer put it, is so correct. His one failing-no equipment but no mind he can do anything else. This Guru invents everything from microbiological warfare to military strategy to complex engineering marvels. But wait! he is a doctor too and an adviser and a lawyer and a prophet. Perfect Taita. By the way, he doesn't want to be free! He likes being a slave!Hmmm...This one person shaped the destiny of an entire country. Really now! The only thing more off putting was the constant adulterous relationships. If you like soap operas or slavery then this will certainly impress you. For others it will be a waste of time."
3,Wilburrrrrrr!,"As an ancient history geek I had to suspend belief a little too often to get through thisbook, which took me about 3 months to finish. I love Wilbur Smith, and treasure the Courtneyseries as as the absolute best historical fiction I've ever read, but this thing.......I don't know, maybe I just have a built in prejudice against pretty gay eunuchs with a 300 IQbut as much as I wanted it to, this book just didn't do it for me."
4,I was hooked!!!,"I've never been much on books set in ancient Egypt, but I've become familiar with Wilbur Smith's other works and thought I'd give it a try. I'm so glad I did! This book was engrossing and entertaining...I literally couldn't put it down. The story is told from the point of view of a slave, Taita, but is told in such a way that you get a feel for all of the characters. The story spans the life of Taita's mistress (owner, not lover!) and her love of one man. I don't want to give away the story to those who might want to read it, but just take my word for it..this story is worth it. The historical detail is exquisite and the story is never slow. My only critism of this book is that Taita seems to be an unlikely character, in that he is an expert in EVERYTHING...medicine, engineering, naval science...you name it and he seems to be the expert. This does not detract from the book in anyway, however. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants pure entertainment."
2,a romance novel,River God is not a historical fiction novel. It is romance pulp that just happens to have the setting of ancient Egypt. The story revealed nothing about life in ancient Egypt. The neutered main character is completely unbelievable with how he is a 'master of all trades'. I regret wasting my time on this book.
1,Gag me with the Crook & Flail,"I cannot believe all the glowing ""reviews"" of this piece of tripe. It appears Smith did his ""research"" by watching 1950's movies about Egypt. If anyone is truly interested in reading well-researched books about engrossing characters set in ancient Egypt, I would suggest you head to the search page and look up ANYthing by Pauline Gedge. Her latest opus, THE LORDS OF THE TWO LANDS (a three book masterpiece) should make Smith and his sycophants hang their heads in shame."
5,Outstanding!,"From beginning to end this book kept me intrigued. The characters were great, the story compelling, and the history... More than once I went digging through my history books looking up Egyptian facts. I didn't want the story to end."
4,A fun read,"The protagonist is too overwhelmingly knowledgable to be real, but the story is fantastic! While some of the details might be far fetched the overall effect ties well to what is known about the era of the 13-15th dynasties of Egypt. The Hykos did invade Egypt at that time. I wish, though, that Smith had found a better way to introduce the ""ideas"" that only Taita supposedly developed."
1,Atrocious book. Immediately forgettable.,"I have seldom read such a horrible book. I clearly need to buy some better light reading. This novel purports to be set in Ancient Egypt and is full of pungeant detail, presented clumsily and inaccurately. I honestly don't know why I continued beyond the gratuitous and ugly violence of the first 50 or so pages. If you like historical fiction based in Ancient Egypt - look elsewhere. Try Gedge or almost anyone else. Gedge is a master; Smith appears to be a pedestrian."
2,"Interesting story, certainly, but...","Uh..... Well.... (Cough, cough) That is to say... (deep breath) Nice cover?No, wait. Let me say a little more:This is not an historical novel. Or if it is, it's not based on Egyptian history. It's a colorful yarn, a violent, interesting, flashy bit of storytelling. The author creates entertaining characters. He conveys pathos, exultation, love, humor... You tend to forget that there isn't a lot of research involved in the tale.Don't get this book for someone you know who is a serious student of ancient Egypt: they'll die laughing."
1,Gary Stu to the n-th power,"I did not manage to get to the end of this book, I got bored way before. It is hard to feel any sympathy for the characters, especially Taita, the narrator. Too many qualities in a single person, there is nothing he cannot do and spends too much time explaining the customs of ancient Egypt to the readers of the 20th century."
1,Complete drivil - no redeeming value.,"This is perhaps the 2nd worst book I have read in the last 5 years (the first being The Illuminator by Brenda Rickman Vantrease). Between the horrible anachronisms, unending similes and the totally unbelievability of the protagonist I just could not take it anymore. Even da Vinci, Einstein, Edison, Benjamin Franklin, Salk and Bobby Flay rolled into one, would not be as perfect as the main character in this story. If you don't want to waste your time, don't read it. Almost anything else would be better."
2,Who cares?,"A good story with strong characters lures the reader's imagination, inspires excitement and anticipation of what happens next. This is not one of those stories. It's not a bad book by any means. Shining moments appear. However, Taita is a character hard with which to sympathize. All the other characters are as translucent as the page held up to a strong light, and the heaped action reaches a point of banality in its lack of specificity. Did I mention it's predictable? You should have expected that.Pick up a Clavell or Jennings instead. This is Soap Opera history."
1,please stop,"I can't stand arrogant people, this is why the arrogant first person writing stile made me give up on this book before finishing it. The historical background of this book is as thin as air in the stratosphere. If mr Smith had taken even the slightest interest in ancient Egypt he would have written a better book. Pyramids by Terry Pratchett is more serious on ancient Egypt than this book."
4,3 and 1/2 if I could,I liked this book. Just wish the series was on Kindle. I'm so spoiled now that I can't even think of bringing a big book with me on my travels. Sorry Wilbur Smith. I will read all your series when they are on Kindle.
4,not his best but far far from his worst......,"First person fiction is not Wilbur Smiths' strong suit,but in a Smith novel, you hardly notice that with the usual break-neck pace of the action. A reader hoping for insights into ancient Egypt will be disappointed, for Smith is not a historical writer and does pretend to be. What he does deliver, (as always), is rapid paced action packed story. No book by this author is disappointing, a bad Smith is better than 99% of the other novelists working today. The major disappointment here is the main character, Taita, who comes across as a arrogant know-it-all, by far the least sympathic main character Smith has ever written. (At times, you wish someone would chain this guy hand and foot and throw his butt to the crocs! ) Despite this, ""River God"" is an excellent read and recommended to anyone who likes a cracking good story....."
5,One of the best.,"I am what you might call, a ""reader"". I read on many different subject. Fiction and Non-fiction. My sister gave me this book and suggested I move it to the top of my list of books to read. So, I sat down on the couch, one sunday, to start River God and ended up reading the entire book in one sitting. I have done this only twice in my life. This book is outstanding."
3,Worth it if youve finished the rest of your library,"I love books on Egypt and enjoyed the book enough to over-look the inaccuracies and enough to overlook how the plot blends from life of father to son without significant transition. However it was very irksome how the slave/narrator character was so much larger than life. It got so out of control as to be unbelievable. Not to mention that the book was unnecessarily long. It started off well enough but finished poorly, leaving me empty. It's worth a read, but I'd check my library first. If you want a good egyptian read Id recommend instead ""The eye of horus"" by carol thurston. A similar story line but more cleanly written, with a glorious begining, middle and end."
4,A great literary character,"Okay, so the narrator -- Taita -- is a bit too good to be true, but since he was supposedly telling the story, wouldn't it be expected that he would make himself a bit larger than life? That's part of the enjoyment of this book, which never takes itself too seriously but still packs a wallop.All the characters, in fact, are idealized as they would be through the eyes of someone like Taita. But I came to care about them and grieved over them when they died.There is a great deal of humor in the book as well, which is needed to balance out the epic drama and violence. Smith did a masterful job of story telling.I don't know enough of Egyptian history to know if the story is ""accurate"" (although who really can tell?. If you're looking for history, try the non-fiction section. But if you're looking for a ""good read"" with the feel of historic authenticity, then give this a try."
5,Go Get This Book,What a Wonderful Read...This was just a wonderful book. I found it to read so easily and the story was marvelous. Who cares about the history being 'right on'. It is fiction people. That is your clue right there. This was the first book I have read by Wilbur Smith and I can tell you I am going to be reading alot more of his. Especially Warlock and The Seventh Scroll. I just could not get enough of this book. It does get gory in spots but that is how it was back then. The sex I felt was minimal and handled with taste. Go get this book. It is well worth it and then some.
5,Best book ever. Couldn't put it down,"I was only 11 when I read this 654 page book. I understood every word and paragraph, not like other adult books that aren't focused and confusing. I savored it till the very last word. I now read Wilbur Smith books all of the time and I'm not dissapointed with any. Even now as a 13 year old I still remember every word of it."
5,excellent,I just could not get away from the book !! It held me enthralled for 2 days ! I ended up buying the rest of the series .
5,CAPTIVATING NOVEL SET IN ANCIENT EGYPT,"I just finished re-reading River God by Wilbur Smith. I love this book, and am so fascinated by novels set in ancient Egypt. It made me laugh, cry, and captivated me utterly. There's a tortured love story, lots of heroism and battle, intrigue and conflict, and an amazing narrator, Taita the slave. He is extremely narcissistic and I'm sure is exaggerating his abilities, but I do think he is a genius at many, many things.Stephen King says that Wilbur Smith is the best historical novelist, and I completely agree. I love how books help me escape, especially the truly epic ones like River God.I'm now going to reread the sequel, Warlock, which is not as good, but still pretty awesome.Paul GenesseAuthor of the Iron Dragon Series"
5,a masterpiece,"Once I was about 15 pages into the novel I was completely hooked. the rest of the book flew by way too fast with exhilerating suspense and deep emotional triumphs. This novel had me chuckling at clever one liners and sobbing at herioc falls. It was purely a wild ride and worth every one of its 652 pages. This epic tale will definitely pull you into the world of the lovable genius Taita and the wonders of ancient Egypt. The only downside to this novel is that when it's over, you'll wish it wasn't."
4,Great mix of history with fiction!!,"As a great fan of ancient history and particurlarly Egyptian history, I really enjoyed this book. It weaves a very enticing story together with trying and crucial time in Egyptian history to produce a very enjoyable literary experience. I really recommend this book to anyone who enjoys history."
5,An extraordinarily masterful story,"Simply, this is the best Wilbur Smith story out there. Masterfully told with excellent detail of the era. Smith brings ancient Egypt alive for the reader in this story on a level that everyone can identify with, the common man's level - but with a twist - Tiata the slave is NOT a common man. A slave becomes the savior of the empire and forever wins your heart. While the story is somewhat gruesome at times, it reflects the trecherous and barbaric era accurately, and reminds us that civilization has not advanced mankind's basic nature in many, many ways."
5,This Book is the greatest!,This book is one of the best historical fiction books about Egypt I've read! I'm quite the Egypt fanatic and this book is great. It sometimes goes into detail too much...but hey it still good! I recomend this book and it's sequal to every one!
5,great reading,30% read great reading W Smith is a great writer I have read a number of his books good reding
3,Frustrating,"Well this book is OK. I bought it due to others reviews. My first and most important thing that I did not like was the fact that it was told in first person perspective by the slave Taita. He was very annoying in the fact that he was a slave yet seemed be the smartest man in Egypt history. He was the best at everything from medical situations to warfare to architecture. The story of Lostris and Tanus was beautiful and fulfilling. Yet it was stuck in the middle of a lot of other filler. There were many times when the story teller sidetracked his main idea. I would say to myself, what he is talking about, where is he going with this, and why is he talking about this. I enjoy lots of dialog and this book has much much more just straight story description. It was a good story and I'm glad I got through it. But I'm not sure I want to read another book like this."
5,Excellent deviation from his past novels,Wilbur Smith has excited readers with his novels on Africa. He is extending his aura to Ancient Egypt with ease
5,River God,"Great read, full of interest and intrigue. these characters are so good it is very hard to put the book down, and then the follow up book is just as good."
5,A Grand tale of Great Proportions,"This book was a very informative on the culture and ideas of the ancient Egyptians. The book is some what based on true events. Fine archeological discoveries are in the making according to the original source that inspired this book. I thought that the first half of the book was more entertaining than the second half. Lord Inter makes an outstanding sinister character. The plot was realistic since both good and the bad people can bite the dust. Taita the slave is full of virtue, though not without some silly ideas concerning freedom and human anatomy. The front cover features a representation of Tutankhamen and his Queen in case anyone is interested, since the book does not mention it."
4,river god,"A wonderful book. It started a little slow and at first I didn't care for the protagonist, but that quickly changed. This quickly became a delightful richly embroidered tale that made me deeply regret that I eventually ran out of pages. It has become one of my favourite novels."
2,wasnt too impressed,"The story has good action and likeable characters but some details bothered me. Like when Taita, the protagonist, disguised himself as a priest, he wore a wig, when in fact, Egyptian priests went completely bald. The number of blond and green eyed characters didnt really convince me either, not in ancient egypt. And another thing that startled me was that the Ethiopian king, was referred to as 'fair skinned'. Also, according to Smith, the Ethiopians spoke Ge'ez when in reality that language hasnt been recorded at the time. And contrary to what was written here, iron wasnt introduced by the Ethiopians, it was introduced by the Hittites about a thousand years later than the setting of 'River God.' i would have enjoyed the book if it was a bit more accurate."
2,a romance novel,River God is not a historical fiction novel. It is romance pulp that just happens to have the setting of ancient Egypt. The story revealed nothing about life in ancient Egypt. The neutered main character is completely unbelievable with how he is a 'master of ALL trades'. I regret wasting my time on this book.
4,Excellent plot that ties the past to the present- read it,This book was very engrossing and vividly took this reader on a ride to the past ! Solid characters and intriging descriptions of that historic lifestyle made for excellent reading ! I will definitely read this one again !(After the book makes its rounds through all my literary circle of friends)
5,Fascinating!,"A friend recommended this book to me, and lent it to me. She told me nothing about it except that I had to read it. I'm not one of those people who looks in the back of a book first. I skipped any introductions, and went straight to Chapter 1. I absolutely loved reading it, and was immersed in the story. Then, I read how this book came to be written and that it was based upon ancient scrolls which were found.I was blown away, and extremely excited to read the other books in this series! I have not been disappointed! It was due to my reading of this book that I became actively interested in learning more about ancient Egypt.What the Torah Teaches us About SurvivalCompanion Workbook to What The Torah Teaches Us About SurvivalWhat The Torah Teaches Us About Spirituality/ Through Isaac's Own Spiritual Journey"
1,A Hot Mess,"I have thoroughly enjoyed several of Smith's books. But not this one. Historical fiction can be fun. Fantasy can be fun. But why the author chose to take an era that had real history, real people and real rulers and then make up some crazy non-historical jibberish to fill it is beyond me. I was terribly disappointed and am sorry I bothered to read it. I prefer to recall the author whose work I enjoyed prior to running across this random mishmash."
4,THE GENESIS OF ROCK AND ROLL,"A few years ago there was a little controversy about whether songs like Joe Turner's Shake, Rattle and Roll or some early Elvis Presley tunes like Hound Dog or It's All Right, Mama represented the genesis of rock and roll. That might be an interesting discussion for musicologists with time on their hands but if you really want to know the answer listen here. If you do not find the base line here for all later classic rock then I am afraid it is lost in the mist of time. Musical trends draw from many influences but the rhythm and blues of the early 1950's seems to have been the real jump point for the turn to rock.This compilation, that is moreover technically competent, is a case study for the above stated propositions. It all comes together here on Shake, Rattle and Roll- the rest just complete the argument."
2,Broken,The compact disc container was received broken and in parts. A rubber band was used to help keep it together. Want to return it.
4,"Looks great, although the cover flap can get in the way while watching videos","I'm a big fan of the leather and faux-leather iPod cases, and this looked like a great one to acommonpany the gift of a new 30 gig iPod video. The iPod fits in with no slippage (it won't move around and scratch up the screen), and the small magnet holds the top shut when not in use. My only problem with it is that when you're trying to watch a movie, you have to either hold the top flap behind it with your hand or balance it on top of the headphone jack, otherwise it will try to flap down and cover the screen. Just something to keep in mind."
3,It was okay,Just ok the clip on the back did not allow iPod to lay flat when being used brighter colors would been nice
4,Tasty tasty potato chips,"I love kettle cooked chips because they are crunchier than other chips. These Dirty Chips are very similar toWise Ny Deli Kettle Chips 9.00 Oz 6 Pack. They're crispy and satisfying, with a mild heat from the Jalapeno powder. It's quite tolerable and not blazing hot.. you can eat a whole bag of these without screaming for help.1 bag is 290 calories (150 from fat), 750 mg sodium (31% daily value). Surprisingly, it contains some nutrition too and is not totally just junk food: 2g fiber (8%), 8% of your daily iron and 25% of your vitamin C. It's all natural and kosher as well."
3,nice chip but jalapeno heat? no way,"Jalapeno heat chip has a nice texture but no kick. Tastes like a regular chip. They rate it XXX in heat, more like a 1/4 X."
5,"Glycerin Usp Liquid - 2 Oz,",The Glycerin Usp Liquid - 2 Oz is the perfect solution to dry hands due to handling and filing papers and orders.
2,Magnets damaged my Treo,"Quite happy with the case, which I use in my pocket (I have the case without the belt clip), so the weak magnets are not a problem.The magnets did damage my Treo (scratches). Sena responded to my email: maybe it happened because I take my Treo regularly out of the case?I thought this answer was not very useful, and their offer to replace the case neither, because my use of the product would not change, and the scratches were there already.Two stars because of quick reply to email and because I love the color (I have the brown case) - also cases do not come slimmer than this one.One more thing: I dropped my phone and since the top corners are not protected guess where the impact hit ..."
5,Great look and easy to install,"I read the reviews and was a little concerned that installing this wheel cover would be very difficult. Not so! It did take me about a half and hour, but the results were worth it. The wheel cover looks great and appears professionally installed. The product is well made and you can pull as hard as you like while stitching and it will not tear. All the holes line up perfectly for a great looking job when you are done."
4,Beautiful!,"Strong with great sound! These heads look very nice on my set and for the price, I think they're a great deal."
1,The Ultimate Con,I had a chance to work with this guy in Texas - has been and still is a crook.....stay away!
5,Excellent Book!,"Well researched, carefully written, excellent photos and drawings! I used this book for reseach for an upcoming book on ""Baloon Buster"" Frank Luke."
1,Another Iomega Bites the Dust,"Well, 8/5/06 it happened again. My Iomega drive went dead. This is my 4th drive I have gone through. Iomega drives work great, but something happens to them.When an error occurs when trying to read/access your drive, that error may toast your drive. And when you have a toasted drive, when you try to read a disk, the disks become toast also.Something happens when accessing the drive to physically damage the drive. I do not understand how it happens, but it does.The drive usually works fine with no problems; however, on the occasion when you try to access drive and a computer error occurs, forget it it is done. It seems like if this happens and that happens when trying to access the drive, it is done.And once done there is NO fixing it. THere is NO fixing of the disks.I am not going with iomega anymore. I think it is time to try something new. I don't even have the will power to call Iomega."
5,Good Deal,"Great deal for those who use Resco trimmers.The blades are durable, but do get dull after several uses.I recommend."
1,These blades are super dull,"These blades I purchased made a mess of my dogs nails. I always give him a bath to soften his nails and then cut them, even then these blades were not effective at all. Usually when you cut your dogs nails the cut should be a clean cut, these left coopers nails a jagged mess, some of his nails the blade couldn't even make it through."
1,Lightweight in Form and Content,"I am surprised to see that this book was published by the J. Paul Getty Museum. The book is based on the first part of ""From Pentelicon to the Parthenon"" published by Melissa Publishing House in 1995.I was expecting something similar to the scholarly ""Ancient Egyptian Construction and Architecture"" by Somers Clarke and R. Engelbach. But I was sadly dissapointed with ""The Stones of the Parthenon"" which is written in a narrative style and has line drawings suitable for children. It's just a novella describing the passage of one block of stone from the quarry to the Parthenon.Save your money for ""The Athenian Acropolis"" by Jeffrey M. Hurwit."
5,fantastic,I get so many complements on what I am wearing all the time and the smells stays with you most of the day. Price and size are fantastic.
3,a little disappointing,"I absolutely love the previous 2 'sound of the...season' cd's (2nd and 3rd) and unfortunately found this one lacking, although I have only listened to it 2 or 3 times so far. It's not terrible, just not up to my expectations from the other 2 as far as energy level and standout tracks. The other 2 reminded me of why I buy this kind of music."
4,O' KAY,"Great comtemporary blues. Kay Kay is in complete control ! Great horn section, too. Anxious for the next release! My rating is actually 4.5 stars.... nothing is perfect, but this comes close."
3,Easy listening,"This is a good CD featuring well orchestrated light hearted music. However, it would be a mistake to consider the recordings contained on this CD as ""All the best from Greece"". These recordings are to Greek music what Mousaka and feta cheese are to Greek cuisine. They're nice and have a good flavor, but there is so much more to experience. This is esentially Greek Muzak."
5,Great travel guide!,"With family living on the Eastern Shore I visit often, but bypass all of the small towns on my way up route 13. I love the Eastern Shore and it is a totally different world! This book opened up many future adventures for our family because of the detailed descriptions and history of each town. I began reading it, placing post-it flags on interesting facts. Until I quickly realized that I was flagging all of the pages! I only wish it came as an eBook."
5,Clockwork is a grand book for children,"Clockwork is a book by Philip Pullman. It tells a wonderful story about a clockmaker who needs to make a clock figure. This clockmaker tells good ghost stories also. The Karl tells a story about the Devil who helps a king. As a matter of fact, the story that he tells did happen. In fact, the story is true. Now, the Devil can make people out of clockwork. The Devil (who acts like a human) makes a Knight for Karl (the clockmaker). Now no more said here. SO GO READ THE BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!My favorite part is when Karl tells the story about the Devil making a child out of clockwork.I recommend this book to anybody any above 4th grade."
4,Just when he gets it all wound up the spring snaps!,"This book is very skillfuly writen by Philip Pullman, all the way up until the end. I am eleven and I have just finished reading this book. It is wonderful story but becomes very weak near the end, it gets very mushy and loses he dark theme Philip had built up throuout the story. Clockwork could easily be twice the length it is now. It is as if Philip ran up agianst at deadline near the end and just finished it. The ending exhibits none of the skill prevelent in the rest of the book."
4,A very creepy (in a good way) story indeed,"Another reviewer said that the story is creepy, and loved it. I cannot agree more. It is not cheap thrill, and you wouldn't expect that from Pullman. I suspect that the resolution could be improved, but who am I to complain. If you get one Pullman book that is not Sally Lockhart or His Dark Materials, then get this one."
4,like clockwork,"I finished this book in an evening. For such a short story, it has many twists and turns. True to its name, the story is tightly wound up from the start, set in motion, and doesn't slow down until the end. Pullman deftly pulls the reader through fear and laughter without missing a beat. Superbly done.The story seems so simple after the first read, but there's much more to it. It's like a Pinocchio-Faustian-Frankenstein fairy tale. A bizarre combination, yet it works so well. It'll be worth many re-reads, especially for kids as they grow older and can grasp Pullman's deeper meanings."
3,Taylor's wonderful magical review,"This book is quite good, but it is a very easy read and can be done in one day. THe character's are average, but the story fits together nicely."
5,Amazing Book!,"I absolutely love this book! 'Clockwork' is the only book I've ever read that's actually frightened me. I've never experienced so many emotions in one book and I'm so glad that I found it on my teacher's bookshelf. It was full of suspense and frightening encounters! I devoured it within a few hours and by the time I was finished I felt like something had a cold, iron grip around my heart. It was extraordinary..."
4,Clockwork,"ClockworkWhat happens when a clock walks? What happens when it can killsomeone?On a snowy night in Germany at the White Tavern Inn, everythingchanges. Fritz, a great writer and storyteller, has written thebeginning of this story but has not finished it! Everythinggoes wrong when Fritz tries to finish it. Can Gretl, a bravelittle girl, stop it? If she knew more than everyone? Wouldshe say nothing about it? Clockwork by Phillip Pullman is athrilling book. The genre of this book is sci-fi and somedrama. I would not recommend this book to children under 10years because of some of the parts are a little gruesome. Thisbook was great but not scary enough for me. Clockwork is goodfor anyone who would love a little thrill in his or herreadings!:-)"
5,A delightfully chilling story... Clockwork,"A reader cannot expect more in a big-lettered, 107 page book, for Philip Pullman is a literal master at delivering a beautifully crafted story. A dark and enchanted story sewn by a man derranged of trying to do his best... A greedy man who wants his new ""toy"" to earn him wealth and power... a young, sweet girl determined to save good... an unforgettable cast of characters and an unforgettable story in one. CLOCKWORK , although far different then Pullman's enchanting HIS DARK MATERIALS trilogy, is a creepy and very absorbing read which I could not put down until I finished the last page, an emotionally heartbreaking ending which is one that will undoubtedly touch the reader's heart and beg for a sequel to this spooky, masterpiece of a story."
4,Excellent book for relucant readers and fans of mild horror,"Pullman did a wonderful job generating suspense that resolved quickly, only to be rekindled. Character development was somewhat lacking, but the story was entertaining and fast moving. Good selection for young reluctant readers 12-14. It may not hold the interest of older YA's"
2,clockwork,"Clockwork is about a man named Fretiz who tells a story about a mechanical boy who had a heart transplant from his father. The characters from Fretiz's story come to life one by one. First, it was the evil doctor who created Prince Florian. Later Florian himself came to the real world. When Florian came he was sick, but after being under the care of a girl named Gretl his mechanical body turned to flesh and he became a real boy. After the night with Gretl in the church steeple everyone said, ""Look it's a living talking statue up in the steeple,"" while pointing at Florian . This book is great for young readers and good for the imagination. Pullman is the author of the Golden Compass and has won many awards. This book is scary and surprising, and it has a classical ending."
2,Clockwork: Or All Wound Down,"This is the first time I have ever written a negative review on AMAZON.COM. But I must admit, Clockwork by Phillip Pullman is the worst book I've ever read. OK, so I'm ten, but who would be interested in fathers giving up their hearts for their mechanical sons? Come on.This book is 90% detail, 10% making no sense.You can read this book, but I don't reccomend it."
4,"Excellent Short Story, but not Pullman's best","I think this short story is definitely worth the read. I passed it around the office after finishing it, and everyone enjoyed it. It is an enjoyable and spooky short story for all ages. The imagery is fantastic. Pullman definitely knows how to tell a spectacular story. However, after reading the Golden Compass trilogy, I was a little dissapointed. The ending to Clockwork was sudden, and not as developed as his other manuals. But for a short story, I think it was excellent. If you enjoy this short story, definitely read the Golden Compass series. I think it would make an excellent Halloween story for kids, and adults enjoy it also. Clockwork is also good for kids who enjoy telling stories or who are learning about time."
2,Irish America,"Ms. Dezell's book gives some interesting insight into Irish populations outside the Boston and New York areas and she has a good sense of wit about Irish nature. However, I found her writing style somewhat unengaging and the stories of the Kennedys and the Catholic Church are the tired ""same old, same old"".This is a topic that deserves more depth than 22l pages but if you like a book with statitics, this one's for you!"
3,Disappointed,"This being my 3rd preschool game I've gotten I was fairly disappointed by this particular game. Too much of a story going on and it can't be interupted with a mouse click. Plus, some of the games are hard for me to understand the concept behind it, much less my 3 year old."
5,A great buy,If your a fan of classic tv like I am you look forward to new seasons of some of the old tv shows and this one is no exception.I would reccomend this collection to anyone who enjoys vintage television classics and its great to see it in color for the first time.
1,Dvd Set Bewitched.,Are you kidding me 999.99$ for this set of bewitched dvd's. I think you should check and fix the price.
1,No English subtitle,I was very very disappointed that this product does not have English subtitle eventhough product information of Amazon says it has. I already opened and played not knowing the fact it does not have English subtitle. Now I can't return nor exchange. I am not happy with my shopping at Amazon this time. I don't want give even one star for the product I received.
5,Love old classics,I was happy it came out with closed captioned cuz there were none before 1980's now I can catch up.
1,Bewitched--Second Season,Vey pleased with the second season of Bewithed. Am looking forward to the third season. Thank You.
5,great deal,i love bewtiched and was happy when this was on a tv dvd sale on amazon. great deal. now i have two seasons
4,"Almost perfect, but only one episode with Paul Lynde","It's hard to knock this almost perfect show that has maintained its charm over 40 years. My children and I howled with laughter at some of these episodes -- I almost forgot how consistently good the writing and acting was across the board. My only quibble is that the box is indeed correct when it says this season ""introduces"" Paul Lynde as Uncle Arthur, as he appears in only one episode in Season Two. I kept hoping he would make a re-appearance but I guess he didn't hit his stride until the next year. Still, Aunt Clara, Gladys Kravitz and the other wonderful character actors make so-called modern situation comedies seem anemic by comparison."
5,I LOVE Bewitched!,This season we are introduced to Uncle Arthur & his practical jokes. Also Season 2 introduced us to Cousin Serena & Tabitha is born! Im happy they're releasing it in color as well as original B&W. I plan to buy both versions. Season 3 was in color so this is the last season in B&W. I only hope Sony contiues to release the other six seasons and that this wasn't just a promo for the Bewitched movie which could NEVER hold a candle to this original TV classic. This season we see more magic than season 1. Personally seasons 3 thru 5 were my personal favorite episodes but I do like the first two seasons too.
5,Dollar for dollar best bass strings on the planet,I have been playing bass for over 20 years and have toured extensively in a rock band. I also spent my formative years trying out different strings by different makers. The Rotosound Swing Bass String has no equal for holding tone and sounding great for longer than any other strings made. And I think Stanley Clark would back me up on that.
5,Aviation enthusiast,"I've read this book 40 years ago, translated into a different language and, since then, I've read it in english a few more times and it is one the best avaiation history/romance int he world."
5,The best aviation book ever written,"The first book I ever read that puts you in the cockpit, sweating to cross the Blue ridge Mountains, or to clear the Taj Mahal. Over 50 years later, the essence of airline flight has not changed, and Gann understood why pilots will aways be at ""The tip of the Arrow"" My mothergave me this book when I was 14, and it led to a career as an airline pilot with a majorcarrier...I have an original 1961 edition of thisbook, one of my most prized positions, and I re-read it from time to time; as a great literarywork, and as a bedrock of what it means tolive and work in the sky...because of men like him, a generation of pilots found their calling.Not just an aviation book, it addresses the ran-domness of fate in all walks of life. Very highlyrecommended!"
5,Read through in few sittings - -,"This is one of those books that has a sneak ending - best appreciated by reading through at a steady rate (which only makes sense once the climax of the book is revealed). The stories, anecdotes and tales seem almost trite and mundane - but build to the showdown, for me a life lesson. Flying is revealed for the joy it is, for its wonder, the thrill of a good landing when one has fought the good fight aloft in peril of ending badly. Gann wrote the thing with a purpose - and it wasn't to entertain you. He is like a grandfather with good advice, and he hits you with a zinger to make the point. You will be grateful, either gender, any station, rich or poor."
5,Captures the True Spirit of flying for the airlines,This book truly captures the emotions of a pilot and what it was like to fly for the flegling airline industry 60 years ago. Mr. Gann also chronicals the start of M.A.T.S. (military air transport service) of WW II. Even though it was written in the time frame of the 30's and 40's it all holds true in todays flying. A must read for any pilot interested in the history of the industry
4,Oldstyle air stories. The way it was. Made it feel very real. It was.,Somewhat laid back. Mondane issues like life and death treated like---a pilot. Got a lot out of this book. Early aviation explaned.
5,"A classic ""Page-Turner""","I first read ""Fate Is The Hunter"" around 1970, and have just re-read it again (for about the fifth or sixth time). I found it to be just as compelling a page-turner now as I did more than three decades ago. Ernest Gann was an enormously talented story-teller. He had the ability to pull his reader into the cockpit, to share with him some of the events he experienced and so flawlessly describes. Vicariously sitting beside the author, the reader comes to understand and feel the accuracy of Gann's premise that Fate ever lurks in the mists, ready to crush the unwary---or unfortunate. This is a great book by a great author. A ""must read."""
5,The best flying book I have ever read,"If you are a pilot and anything that is described in this book hasn't happened to you (or someone you know) it will, given time.I found the descriptions of the approach to ""Bluey West One"" (now called Narsasuak) the best preparation I could get for actually going there!The book is written by a man who knows his subject. The descriptions of an aeroplane icing up and of preparations for a ditching, get nearer the truth than any operations manual ever has.This book should be standard issue to anyone who seeks to make flying his career."
5,More than an aviation book,"Oh man, does writing get any better than this? A diffrent ethic, from a diffrent age, this is a transportation to a time when experience, intuition, and personal integrity were essentials to growth - and survival! Read the other reviews, read his other books, and read ""Fate Is The Hunter""!"
2,Fate is the Hunter,"This 1986 paperback does not contain all of the material included in the original edition of 1961. There are numerous experiences and anecdotes omitted. For example, the episode on which the movie, ""Fate is the Hunter"" is based, is not included in this new edition. Some of the best material has been left out."
5,"A classic. If you love aviation, it is a must read.","I read this book when I was a youngster, and my generationof aviators consider this book and its stories to be a partof their aviation heritage.Anyone who loves adventure, or airplanes, or aviation,should read this book."
5,"Awe inspiring vividness and style,indelibly rendered.","A favorite of editor of an aviation trade magazine,his recommendtion was most enjoyable. You will never take a pilot's rolein preserving your life for granted,and you will long rememberthat each day is a gift that has arrived for reasons far deeperthan your own best efforts. The amazing level of detail andthe writing style of Mr. Gann is an inspiration to all,especially anyone who flys or dreams to fly, or seeks toenrich one's life by exposure to an essential chronicle ofAmerican history recounted by an extraordinary storyteller.This review makes no attempt to approach the beauty of thisincredible masterpiece of non-fiction. It must be read."
5,Great Book For Aviators,Ernest K Gann was a very good writer. He describes the early days of airline flying and you feel like you're along with him on those flights.
5,Fate is the Hunter,"Having read this book in 1966 and again some two years later, and now again in it's reprinted edition It still amazes me with it's stories, mostly based on Fact. It was my Instructors bible, and he did in fact use some of the examples when I was learning to fly. Once taught never forgotten."
5,"After 10 years, I still find myself thinking about this book","I read this book 10 years ago for an aviation class and I couldn't put it down! I recommend it for anyone who is a pilot, wants to be a pilot, or is interested in flying at all. Gann is one of the most colorful writers I have ever read. His use of descriptive narrative puts the reader right into to cockpit!"
3,Higher Recommendation Pending Bulb Life,"These are very reasonably priced wide angle (60 degree) MR16 bulbs, with a published life of 5000 hours. I purchased ten for outdoor lighting fixtures.Pro: Wide angle and color much improved over previous standard bulbs.Con: With five of these operating for about 100 hours, one has already burned out.Time will tell if this is a single failure, or bulb life will make these a poor choice. I'll try to revise this review in a few months.Update: Several months later, no more bulbs have died, so I raised the rating to three stars."
5,For MARINE ANIMAL LOVERS and CHILDREN!,"Not only sharks, but octopuses, squids, poisonous and venomous fish, sea snakes, and ""sea monsters""! A great book for all, with beautiful color photos."
4,Could've been a slight better,"I love this album.. but no album really deserves 5 stars.. but this comes close. The best songs on this album are ""Love to Hate, Hate to Me"", ""A Song for a Broken Heart"", and ""The Shooting Star that Destroyed Us All"". The other songs on the album are pretty good, but those are the best. Joe needs to scream a tad bit more though."
1,Have you ever noticed....,"That whenever people right positive reviews about these positively terrible bands they always mention something along the lines of: ""This band is a perfect mix of Style A, Style B, Style C"". Go look through the reviews, you'll see what I'm talking about. Wouldn't this just prove that all these bands (and the list of them appears endless) are just doing the exact same things. Doesn't every false-core band have a song called ""Lipgloss and Letdown"" or ""The Beautiful Letdown"" or something that would appear cool had it not been redundant or a redundancy. Truth is, you probably havn't noticed this, after all, you are lame enough to listen to this band."
2,The truth,"Perfect if you're the ages of 14-16 or very easily impressed other than that ""pretty wack"".The withered EP recordings were more raw and powerful.something about this album is just too watered down.The Lyrics on Lipgloss and letdown are so stupid I cant help but think they're about tripping someone."
1,weak and unoriginal a pure flash with no brilliance,"Static is so easily transparent that I find it odd there are so many other good reviews for this album--I figure it must be the bands friends writing the reviews. There is nothing to this album that has not already been done by numerous punk bands over the last 20 years; it is completely unoriginal. That may sound like a bold and harsh statement considering that most great bands today are inspired none-the-less from musical fore-fathers. Their live show is even weaker than their album, sad to say. Maybe they will get their act figured out but, more likely than not, the mediocre attention this album has received will fade out and not resurface for Static in the future regardless of how many albums they put out."
5,The best band ever!!!,"A Static Lullaby rules!! There's no other band that can compare to this one. A perfect mix of hardcore, punk, and emo makes them such a great artist. They are awesome at base, acoustic, electric guitar, singing, screaming, and drums. A Static Lullaby is such a talented band that I can't believe they aren't recognized more!! Hopefully soon they will be. They are an awesome band that deserves more. All ten songs on ""And Don't Forget To Breathe"" are sweet and cool. I hope their next album will be just as good and the artist will remain as good. In conclusion, if you like A Static Lullaby, you also will probably enjoy these bands: From Autumn To Ashes, Remembering Never, Killswitch Engage, Pipedown, Thrice, Glassjaw, Eighteen Visions, Hatebreed, Thursday, Finch, and Demon Hunter. But A Static Lullaby is 100% better than all those put together!!!!!"
2,sub-par mediocre emocore,"I listen to a lot of different styles of music but hardcore is certainly a passion of mine. So when I put in Static Lullaby for the first time in my cd player, I was initially impressed. There is a hardcore catchiness to this album that I soon realized was not very original at all. A.S.L. seems to be trying too hard to fit the hard core bill when all they really are is a screamo emo band, and that just depresses me. There are already enough bad bands out there that fit this bill (namely the used...what a joke!, story of the year...yeah saddest story of the year, From Autumn to Ashes, and too many others to name). Good hardcore is not A.S.L., instead go out and buy some poison the well, hopesfall, boy sets fire, snapcase, or the bled. Those should do the trick for all you sick people who insist on referring to such terrible bands as the saviors of music. Where have we gone wrong?"
1,good for a little while...then garbage.,"When this cd first came out I took a liking to it, but after a little while i noticed that the songs were getting old quick. i dont listen to it anymore. they need a new cd. really bad. if your looking for a longterm investment in a cd that you want to listen to over and over and over again for a long time, this isnt a good cd. im not bashing the band, but they need new stuff.you filthy animal"
4,"A Static Lullaby ""...And Don't Forget To Breathe""","I had heard a lot about this cd before checking it out. Opinions of all kinds: good, bad, amazing, garbage. I personally, however, think it is a really good album. Of course right off the bat people are going to say that it's not original. This still makes me mad because if there is only one band for each type of music then how do you maintain what we like to call a genre. But that's another story. This album combines suprisingly good singing with great screaming. The actual music isn't great but they're not horrible either. Highlights include ""Lip Gloss and Letdown"" and ""Charred Fields Of Snow.""Rating: Four stars."
2,I can't agree,"There's no way I can agree with any of these reviews. Here's the good and bad of this CD.Good: The band (minus the lead singer) is really good. Just about every song starts out great until the singer opens his trap and screams a bunch of nothing. Song #3 ""Withered"", was really going good but you can hear the singer holding back a scream through most of the song.Bad: The lead singer. the lead singer, the lead singer. Did I mention the lead singer?...I can understand the need for something new and better but this is not it. There's plenty of awesome new music out there so go sample some real rockers (Kidney thieves hint hint) and let these guys go until they've hired a new lead or pelted him in the head enough that he'll get the message. If you know the band, please send my regards. I gave them 2 stars because I had to hand it to the band to be able to play that well through that screach. P.S. Kick the producers...also for letting it go this far."
4,Sweet band,I highly recommend this band if you're into Finch/The Used/Glassjaw/Deftones/Thrice/Thursday.The CD itself is as well balanced as the above mentioned bands are - every song has its moments of hard and soft.The guitars are exception with a couple of really excellent solos.
3,What?,"This band screams WAY too much. The screaming trend was cool for a while, but this band gets way out of hand. Other than that they are ok, but It seems like it would be hard to relate to a band that does nothing but yell the whole time. I guess it would be cooler if you are into the the Emo scene and crying to yourself all night...."
4,Good CD,"I think this is a great cd, along the same lines as the new underoath, etc. Can't just listen to a few songs, gotta play it all the way through, can't get enough of it.But if you're looking for something more hardcore check out ""In Reverent Fear"" They're still relatively unknown, but they put on the best live show and have gone to the top of my list. well worth the money!!"
4,Amazing.,"It took me a while to get into this so it may take you a couple of listens to get the feel of this. This is a fairly new band with heavy melodic rock screaming. It sounds like glassjaw when the singing is on key and the used. Very good. The only reason why i give it 4 stars is because it is the typical style thats spreading right now with this screamo trend going on. If your into Finch, glassjaw, Used,Thursday, Beautiful mistake, then A Static Lulaby is for you"
4,"Finally, a band to match thursday","ASL is like the hardcore haters hardcore. They're not really heavy (no metalcore growls or pointless breakdows), but the torment and melody in the lead singers voice is enough to get the message across like a sledgehammer. Some people complain because there's TOO much singing (they're stupid, i know), but really, isn't it singing that makes music what it is? ASL is up there w/ bands like (new) underoath, emery, a thorn for every heart and of course, thursday (the greatest hxc band ever. period.). If you want a well produced piece of emocore, and are getting sick of wearing your copies of ""they're only chasing safety"" and ""war all the time"" down, get ""and don't forget to breathe"". It's just too bad there new album sucks balls."
2,Identity Crisis,"This is clearly a band who just dont know what they are.Although there are a lot of good melodies in this album, the vocals just kill any thought of this being a good disk. They're absolutrely terrible. It's kind of like Korn trying to record some punk rock-emo type rifs. It just doesnt work.This might be a valid attempt, but songs like ""Song For a Broken Heart"" don't make you question why she left him. It's more like a bunch of kids just bitching (albeit mostly screaming and yelling) about why life [is bad]."
2,eeeeeeeehhhhh,"this seems like ferret records signed a band that they thought was trendy...its sorta commercial sounding and not all that great. First two songs show nice potential (except for some wierd soloing in the background..doensnt fit). This isn't especially impressive. For more inspired music along these lines, check out Hopesfall, Shai Hulud, Every Time I Die, or This Day Forward. This band isnt bad but certainly not good..."
3,Huh?,"This movie started very slow, but kept my attention. As it revealed its plot and strange things began to happen, then an hour later it ended. Huh? The ending was rather dumb. Sorry I'm such a critic but once again I started watching with high expectations and was left disappointed. I have to stop doing that."
3,Is Dark Water a psychological suspense film or a horror flick?,"I guess for me it was more of a psychological suspense story than a horror flick and that's why their was no real scares in the movie. And if people watched it expecting chills down their spine were probably disappointed. Me, as a single mom who raised her kids with no help from dad, I felt bad for Dahlia. And because of my own life may have read too much into a simple thriller."
1,SUCKS SUCKS CSUSCKJKSCKSCK,"I completely agree with the 1 star people. When I was watching with my dad we were both like ""ok.... it's an hour into the movie and nothing has happened."" Why is it unrated? No cussing, violence, or nudity!!!SUCKS SUCKS"
2,Disappointed,"I had high hopes for this one. I am a huge fan of Jennifer Connelly and scary, atmospheric movies, but this one was just kind of boring. There were no surprises for me and the story developed very slowly."
3,Watered down,"When a newly-divorced woman moves into a creepy apartment with her young daughter, she must contend with sinister neighbors, migraine headaches, a stressful custody battle, and, perhaps, a vengeful ghost. The cast is very good and the atmosphere is creepy, but there just isn't much to this story. The narrative becomes confused by some plot elements that amount to nothing--why did the lawyer lie about being with his family? Was the husband really plotting something with the suspicious teenagers? It's a decent film, but nothing special."
2,A big disappointment...,"This movie starts out great, but after a while it turns into a psychological thriller... and not a very good one. There are so many emotional issues and struggles of the main character, Dahlia, which completely takes over most of the movie. The little ghost girl is hardly a character at all and her story was completely summarized over, though it should have been Dahlia's story that was summarized. Normally don't mind these types of stories about a struggling mother dealing with childhood issues, but why set it up in ""horror"" skin clothing in the trailers? I was ready for a night, where I had to sleep with the light on. Instead, I was cheated."
2,DARK WATER - UNRATED - (BELIEVE ME IT'S STUPID),"When i first heard about this movie I wasn't to thrilled about it. I've seen a LOT OF thriller/horror movies in the past but this one was absolutely dumb. Where's the main plot?Although the acting wasn't bad, the story line was completely stupid. And although i haven't seen the original version, how could this movie be unrated?I'm sick of movies that come out with unrated version that have the f*** used once or twice, that is stupid."
2,dark toilet water,i really wanted to like this movie..great cast..well acted..the look of the movie gives off a very eerie presence..but the ghost aspect of the movie and the ending very disappointing..connelly is superb
2,It's on the boarder line of beeing a good movie and a bad movie but overall the story builds up to nothing,"In the tradition of The Ring and The Grudge come Dark Water. The movie tanked at the box office and the trailers did not look good but I wanted to see it to see if it was scary and it was not. The movie is on the boarder lione of beeing a good movie and a bad movie. The good stuff the acting is good, the story is ok and it builds up lots making you think there will be scary moments and a good ending but your wrong. The movie builds up to nothing it's just a dissapointing ending. There are many pointltss parts and charactors to this movie. It's not scary and not worth the watch."
4,I think this story had more to meaning to it then being scary,This was a great movie because it showed the love between the mother and daughter. Jennifer Connelly's chacter flashes back to her childhoodand her mother was a mean mom that didn't love her and it affectedher alot. The Dark Water just pushed her over the edge and caused her migranes.This movie is a thrilller but you have to look for a deeper meaning in the movie to see what a great movie this really is.
3,Not too bad,"The movie, as the title describes, was dark. I personally don't like these types. However, I thought the acting was good and the suspense also good. For those who like The Ring, this will come as a welcomed movie. As I am not a fan of this genre I just watched it to the end to find out what the mystery was!!!"
2,Atmosphere without Substance,"Jennifer Connelly does an exceptional acting job in this film that creates a dark wet soggy atmosphere for 100 minutes, but never develops any substance.The film seems like a study in using atmosphere to set a mood but little more.Does anybody else notice that RING, RING 2, GRUDGE and now DARK WATER are all the same story slightly rehashed and done over and over again ?Amazing they have been able to make money by making the exact same movie 4 times from the same basic story (ie... lost or neglected kid and water coming from beyond the grave)This was hard to take serious with nothing but drips, water leaks and geysers for 90 minutes...... and of course it was not helped any with the ending kind of given away in the first 15 minutes.HINT..... as mentioned above, this is a quick rehash of Ring and Grudge, etc..."
3,Could rival Stephen King,"The strength of Steven King is being keeping his creepiness on the edge of what can be real or normal. This story, a remake of the Japanese film by Hideo Nakata and based on ""Honogurai Soko Kara"" by Koji Suzuki is one of those that are just on the edge of real.Probably mentally challenged Dahlia Williams (Jennifer Connelly) is in the middle of a nasty divorce and due to economics is moving with her daughter `Ceci' (Ariel Gade) to a creepy slum tenement. Her daughter is also going a little funny, seeing dead people and so are we. Can her mother turn this all around and pull us out of this slump with a happy ending? Only time will tell. Now sit back and do not get caught talking to the invisible or very visible Natasha Rimsky (Perla Haney-Jardine.)Dark City [Blu-ray] - Jennifer Connelly"
2,Thought Japanese Version Was Better,"I watched this version first and thought it was ok...but then I saw the Japanese version and it put this one to shame. Definitely see it to see it, but also watch the other version."
3,Confusing I must say.,"Dark Water starring Jennifer Connelly had great potential as a psychological thriller but this film is a let down. First of all, the premise seems smart but by the end of the film I am confused by all the chracters never shown in the climax. Connelly is a wonderful actress and she is perfect for the part but I wish her character had more to do rather just puttering around the apartment all day. This film is not terrrible, it's just so-so. Decide for yourself on this one."
4,Probably should give it the highest marks!,"This film comes close to deserving the highest rating of 5 stars, just to balance out those who aren't giving it due credit. It certainly deserves at least my 4 star movie; because a movie that keeps you interested and on your seat, waiting for the next thing to happen deserves that at least. I wonder what it might have been rated if it came out when the ""Shining"" came out, because I think the two are fairly equal; different stories of course. The movie did twist at the end; the film went black and I thought maybe the closing credits were going to roll: I won't give it away, but it almost is like there could have been a multiple choice ending to this movie; well done; and at least 4 stars. Maybe for my comfort; I can choose which ending I liked."
2,Yet another pointless and disappointing remake,"In similar vein to The Grudge and The Ring (penned by the same author as this yarn), Dark Water is a Hollywoodised (for that read watered-down) take on a fairly stylish Asian original horror.Whilst not only lacking the class of the original, Dark Water also suffers from being quite a weak and formulaic ghost story. I mean come on! We can all surely guess what's happened to the missing girl after the first 15 minutes and how many times has the old ""invisible friend"" routine been trotted out before?There are no real shocks along the way - just a mildly creepy atmosphere and I'm surprised this was 15 rated. I've seen scarier PGs!On the plus side, Pete Postlethwaite as the flats' handyman harboring a terrible secret and the little girl Ceci (Ariel Gade) put in very convincing performances. The material here isn't really strong enough to make their sterling efforts truly memorable though.Disappointing."
3,Not really a horror film,"I have mixed feelings about this film. Although it was suspenseful and the screen shots were really good, I felt that the plot is very predictable. Just like ""The Ring"", the malevolent force is a little girl that was abandoned by her parents. It has a lot of drama between Dahlia (Connelly) and her ex-husband concerning the custody of their daughter and I suppose that it the human-interest part of the story. I cared about the characters, especially Dahlia's little girl, Cecilia. Ariel Gade's acting was heartbreaking. If you're looking to be scared, this is not a film for you. It's more of a psycho-drama."
2,Very boring,"This movie begins like so many other horror/thriller movies. In this case, a woman in the midst of divorce and custody proceedings is moving into a new place with her daughter. The daughter is apprehensive about the move and the mother reassures her that everything will work out. We wait for something scary to happen...The building/setting is indeed spooky, but nothing eventful happens for quite some time. There are many boring stretches in the film that may not be able to hold your attention. I honestly gave this movie a chance, but it simply wasn't scary or all that suspenseful. It reminded me of ""The Ring"", but without the good story and lure.There is plenty of bonus material on the DVD, but it's barely even worth watching people speak with such ferver about a movie that falls so short."
1,Do NOT waste your time and money,"This movie was terrible. It made no sense, had little direction and focus, and was just plain BAD. The plot was pretty much non-existant."
1,Hollywood should stop cloning all those great asian horror flicks!,"I have seen the original Dark Water and it kept me on the edge of my seat!! But this no-name director turned that great asian flick into a HBO-sunday-matinee-family-movie. Now they lure the money out of your pockets with an ""unrated edition"". Exuse me? WHAT exactly was there to be rated in the first place? NOTHING. This movie is absolutely NOT scary at all. The actors are simply too cute looking to be scary. All the scary effects from the original movie where simply left out! I have seen dozens of asian new-horror ghost flicks and believe me, this remake simply is not worth buying, renting or even watching! Please go watch the original Dark Water, you won't be dissappointed!!"
1,Plumbing Problem?,Why not ask for another apartment. I don't know of anyone who wouldn't.I guess bad things happen to stupid people.
1,Not scary and not good at all,I dont know the dude who makes these movies are pretty similar except the Ring is better I didnt waste my time seeing Ring 2 and well I wasted my time seeing Dark Water and well I wish I never did lose 2hrs of my life but I didnt waste money on it so its all good. Jennifer Connelly is hot.
1,COMPLETE AND UTTER CRAP,"I'm a horror movie fanatic, and after seeing this advertised on TV, i decided to go see it. WHAT A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY. This isn't a horror movie! All it is is some single mom and a dick husband fighting for custody of their daughter. I was so pissed when I got out of the theater. They should advertise this for what it is: drama bullsh*t. Go see The Devil's Rejects. Now that is a good movie."
1,Pete Hammond's remark on dvd cover,"Mr. Hammond I think your ""even Hitchcock could no have done it better."" remark on hte Cover of Dark Water was stunning. I do not think Hitchcock would give this ""film"" the time of day. So how could he have done it better? w"
3,"Jennifer Connelly is on in Dark Water, give it a chance.","DARK WATER is the American remake of the Japanesemovie of the same name. I also agree with another reviewer,this is a thriller not a horror movie. Do not letthat deter, this is a pretty intelligent thriller bundledas a drama. Speaking of that then there is nobetter dramatic actress right now than JenniferConnelly. Even snobbish critics of this movie can't slamher performance in this, she is very , very good.Connelly is become a master of this sort of thing, lettingher emotions speak for itself and guide the movie intoa dark atmosphere, something she's done quite well inher work (A Beautiful Mind).I liked the movie overall, and I have not seen the Japanesemovie, but that's a good thing since people won'tbe so conceited in comparing both. That said it was muchbetter than ""The Grudge"" with Sarah Michelle Gellar. Thatmovie was horribly directed, edited and acted.This movie was not, it's got a decent cast includingJohn C. Reilly."
2,Two Hours of my Life I'll Never Get Back,"The acting is quite good. Everybody, including the little girl, do a superb acting job.Unfortunately, that is the only good thing I can say about this film. I can't even think of who WOULD like this film. It tries to be scary, but it isn't. It tries to be smart, but it isn't. There is no tension and the only part with a little bit of suspense was just weird.The Ring was great! The Grudge was okay. But this addaption of a Nakata film really missed the mark."
1,"Yes, the movie is dark but it's not scary at all.","Yes, the movie is dark but it's not scary at all. There's no suspense either. What a waste of time."
2,Depressing,"The title should have warned me...dark water is murky, and so is this plot. Depressing story has no real redeeming qualities except for the acting."
2,Very Disappointing,"I rented this as soon as it was released on DVD and was very disappointed. It could be due to the fact as a recently divorced father, it hit close to home.The story centers around Jennifer Connelly and her daughter looking for an affordable place to live after a seperation. She finds an apartment on dreary Rossevelt Island and soon begins to hear noises from the apartment above.The whole setting is dark and depressing from it constantly raining, the lack of color anywhere to the depressing situation that the single mother and her adorable daughter are stuck in. I won't ruin the end but it was extremely sad and dark.Rent this movie if you are feeling down and it will surely keep you there."
2,When you fall asleep be sure to wake up for the end,"Dark water was a movie a lot of people expected to be really good but the truth is it isn't. It's almost like false advertisement because the movie wasn't scary at all and it was very boring and way to long. I fell asleep a after the first half hour and when I watched the parts I missed I knew why I went to sleep. It's the slowest movie I've ever seen, you find is some interest in it to see what's up with the dark water but it turns into being a watered down version of The Ring. Everything is obvious from the beginning, you know why the dead child is torturing the apartment building and after that you just watch to see how she died. The only thing making this movie even a little worth watching is the surprising ending. It's better to see the original Japanese version anyway."
2,The Ring was Great but Let's Leave Well Enough Alone!,"Jennifer Connelly is beautiful and a very talented actor, but like someone else stated that was not enough to save this film. Enough of the Japanese remakes. The Ring was a great remake of Ringu. But The Grudge, Dark Water, and many others need to just stop it. I am just waiting for Hollywood to Remake Tommy a very played out Japanese series of flims about a girl who won't die and keeps getting reborn in strange ways. There are about a dozen of them literally; Tommy, Tommy Replay, etc.I just hope Hollywood doesn't touch Spiral a great Japanese film. The Ring was great but let's leave Well enough alone.If you want to see Jennifer Connelly in a great horror Film, rent Creepers by Dario Argento, she is about 15 or 16 years old and is excellent in this film. Strangly she doesn't look much different back then than she does now which is kinda creepy in itself."
2,ANOTHER ASIAN DOWNFALL !!!!!,"Did u see ""RING 2"" anyone?/?? this is another lame, stupid scrip and story just like that. Is same twin movie. Only this time is about mother and daughter! Instead GHOST in tape, this time ghost in the water. Same exact story. but this time ,I was sooo happy didn't buy this crap like I did with RING 2 , this time I just rent this movie before buying it and I am soo happy I did NOT pay damn (...)for this new junk!!! This Asians craps story right after each other getting lame and stupid and not scary at all....(this is Clearly is PG-13) un-rated crap, Don't mean nothing not gore, blood or scary or nothing whatsoever in this movie is same lame and boring drama/suspense like the ring2 was ,and did sucked...don't waste your time and money in this B.S! C"
3,Dark Water,"It all begins inside Apartment 9F. This is where a single mother, Dahlia Williams, is trying to make a brand-new start in life. Attempting to escape from a bitter custody battle with her estranged husband, Dahlia moves with her daughter Ceci to a dilapidated, sprawling housing block on Roosevelt Island at the very edges of New York City. This movie has plenty of creepy moments, but not any satisfying jolts."
2,Could've been much better,"This movie had great potential. All it turned out to be was sort of long and boring at time. Here's the problem, without spoiling the movie. The pace of the movie didn't move up at all. Instead it crawled at a very linear angle and just didn't seem to rise to a climax that was satisfying. Jennifer Connelly is a gorgeous actress and an extremely convincing one at that. But, her talents were waisted in this very surreal movie. I like the claustrophobic atmosphere the movie conveys, but, I never felt that the character was really in any danger or in a really terrifying situation. Like I said, it had potential, but really didn't take you to where it should have. The ending was great and unexpected, but, as a whole, the movie was way too drawn out.See it for yourself and see what you think."
1,Huge waste of my time!!!,"Don't watch this. It was stupid. I sat through the whole movie, don't know why, but I wish someone would have warned me how dumb it was going to be. Bad movie, decent acting, horrible story, even worse ending."
2,"A depressing situation ain't scary, just depressing","I found this film to be more depressing than scary. The bulk of it seems focused on the soul numbing daily problems faced by a recently divorced young mother. I wish to forget the ""rat-race"" part of life when I am in that darkened dream arena, not be plunged eyeball deep in another's. For the most part, whatever few scares there are can easily be explained by natural causes, provided by the film's storyline. The music and overloud/overdramatic sound effects try desperately to drum up the suspense...but grow tiresome when there are no payoffs in the story. It's got a group of good actors that need a story with an arc that includes tension and release, ups and downs of human emotions, scenes that instill dread and suspense...drama. Not unrelenting depressing existence."
2,*yawn*,This movie was very slow going. If you are looking for a good scare......keep looking. I gave it two stars because Jennifer Connelly is a wonderful actress.
3,Stylish horror flick,"The movie started off slowly but had a well-executed ending. The horror element was more in essence than the typical shock-you-in-the-face-visually-macabre kind. The cinemaphotography was bleak and brooding and the cast was competent, with Jennifer Connelly delivering yet another Oscar-worthy performance as the troubled mom with a past and a present wardrobe chock-full of skeletons to conquer. My recommendation is: if you had the patience to sit through the first hour of the movie, hang in there for its climactic finale."
1,Cookie cutter,"I purchased this book thinking it would offer a variety of styles and details. What I found was a run of the mill Florida cookie cutter style (neither mediterranean, nor Spanish, nor Italian, nor classic), the kind you find at just about every cookie cutter development in the Southwest and Florida. Even more disappointing, however, was the fact that I found the exact same plans, illustrations, and photos found in several home plans magazines, particularly those by Home Planners, inc.Overall, the book was short on substance and detail, and the plans were so convoluted, I felt I had opened a puzzle book instead of an architecture/design book."
1,Some people will believe anything,"No serious Jew would ever entertain becoming a Messianic Jew. Just ask yourself why our Jewish ancestors kept Jewish when it would have been so easy to become Christian. So now they've invented a way of being Jewish and believing in Jesus. I see another review says that messianic Jews need support - too right, cos there is no basis for their belief in Jesus. No world peace, no Kingdom of Heaven, nothing to support Jesus as the Messiah. He was a Jew who was killed by the Romans. This book tries to pull the wool over your eyes. Don't be a dupe. If you are wondering why this book is so pointless and wrong, go and consult your local Orthodox Rabbi."
3,Masterpiece spoiled by amateur editing,"Wonderful story, acting, casting, camera work -- and then when it's finished they give it to a teenager to edit.""How about lots of excessively loud, totally out of context 'whooshes' when the camera pans quickly? What about some incredibly loud 'bang! bang!' noises as we have quick editing shots between scenes?"" Unbelievable that so much wonderful work could be so badly marred in the final edit. Personally I think that they were running out of time and nobody checked the editing, now they are kicking themselves."
4,Good quality,I would recommend this disc to anyone who likes to see good acting. I am very satisfied with the product.
4,Very well done.,"I found this production of Bleak House to be much more captivating than the 1985 production, although both are well done. This production seemed to tell the story more completely (and it is longer). All acting was well done. The camera work was a little out of character for the period piece, but only a minor distraction.I did find it hard to follow the dialog with the various dialects of the characters. Yay! Subtitles were available on the DVD, so I could watch via the component connection to my TV (higher quality picture) and still get the captions. The 1985 production does not offer that."
5,"Very Surprised, Very Good!","I actually bought this for my girlfriend for Christmas. She saw it on PBS and really liked it. I was a bit skeptical, but kept my mind open as I watched it with her. It kept me interested with some unusual characters and even a spontaneous combustion. It is very bleak, and the mood is quite dim. But this Dicken's classic was very well done. I have an English Lit degree, so that may have helped in my appreciation of the series. I would highly recommend this to anyone who likes Dickens, or movies of books like Jane Eyre or Wuthering Heights."
5,A great and not entirely bleak story,"All the cast members here are great, especially Gillian Anderson. This is the lengthy but always compelling story of the Jaunydyce family, the Dedlocks, and many other people, both friendly and unfriendly, that they are associated with in London and the English countryside. Secrets and plots threaten to destroy some people, and in some cases this happens--but it's never too much for the viewer to bear.Check this out and enjoy the superb acting and production design."
5,Short Review,"Bottom Line: This adaptation is brilliantly acted. Anna Maxwell Martin and Gillian Anderson both shine in their roles. It is a bit long, but stick with it - you won't be disappointed!"
5,Exceptional !! Don't Miss Out !!,"Actually, this is a 10 star film. I am a Dickens fan and found this version of ""Bleak House"" to be superb. They could not have casted the roles any better; the acting is just outstanding. And I believe that Dickens himself would be proud of this film in the way that it remains true to the story/plot as so few film adaptations do. I highly recommend adding this one to your collection of great films."
3,Great Acting- HORRIBLE Direction,"I've never read the novel so I came at this not knowing the story in advance or having any pre-conceived notions. The acting was very impressive and if it wasn't for that I would've given up on this miniseries after the first episode. The direction was extremely melodramic almost to the point where it ruined the performances. So many scenes were violently bombarded with melodramatic spooky horror music and sharp zoom lens as a desperate attempt to chill the audience when a subtler approach would've done just fine. The director feels the audience stupid and did not believe that the actors could communicate their characters well enough- in the case of Mr. Tulkinghorn, the director feels the need to remind us that he is ""evil"" by blasting spooky music on during his scenes and zooming in on his ""evil"" eyes. My friend and I kept rolling our eyes at these instances. The actors are so wonderful. What a shame the director got in the way."
5,Bleak House brought to life,"Bleak House is the selection for this month's Guardian Book Club. Maybe I am cheating by watching vs. reading but the production is so beautifully wrought, who can blame me? The sets, sounds and authentic accents are so much richer than my imagination could produce."
5,Bleak House,"True to Charles Dickenson's form, the interesting dark characters that I sometimes don't like, the story was captivating."
1,Very unhappy,I am sorry to report that I was unable to view this fim as it would not play on any(4) multiplay dvd machines!
2,Sloooooooow,The subject line says it all...could not get through the episode. Difficult to follow. The movie just wasn't my type of movie
5,"Love, Love, Love this!!!","Gillian Anderson is wonderful in this. Charles Dickens does it again. You will not be able to stop watching this. Mystery, love, murder! This is another masterpiece!"
5,Entertainment for the family,I enjoyed this series on our public TV station. I would look forward to the day and hour all week. I wanted the show for my own enjoyment. Rewatching the story and discussing the historic background with the family proved educational. I know it isn't the same as reading the classics and no one ever portraies the characters and scenes exactly as the author would have...but I still enjoyed this version.
5,"Yes it's really, really long, but I wouldn't have it any other way.","This is an excellent miniseries as many others have detailed. It is extremely long, but the individual episodes are just 30 minutes to an hour. You don't have to devote an entire saturday to it -- but be prepared, you will always want to watch just one more episode than you intended to!"
5,Learning about life,A fantastic prodcution which gives us a great introduction to Victorian life and Human nature.
4,"Confusing at the beginning, but worth slogging through it","I was really confused for the first episode or two, but by the third episode I was hooked. Great casting, set design, acting, dialog...."
5,BBC Drama is Great!,"I Love This Movie Bleak House, I've watched it twice already. Wonderful actors and Victorian Clothing was so pretty! This mini series is Great, I recommend to all people whom love BBC Drama as I do!"
4,Good Dickens dramatization,"If you like Dickens and Victorian/period pieces, you'll like Bleak House. God actors and a plot that draws you in."
5,Wonderful and engrossing,"i haven't yet read Bleak House, so this review isn't about faithfulness to the plot, Dickens' voice, or such.It's also not a very deep and analytic review - I just thoroughly enjoyed this show, plowing through it in two evenings. The acting is powerful and emotional, the sets realistic and believable. Episodes seemed to pass in the space of a few minutes, and i found myself unable to resist the pull of ""just one more"" episode."
2,Not what I expected,You cannot plan a trip on any of the off-trail routes based upon the information in this book. It has lots of nice information about plants and large stands of old growth forest. This is a nice touch which many guidebooks simply overlook. Most of the offtrail routes have little more than a couple of sentences. This is not a Beckey Guide by nay means.
1,Sifu???,"Lyons doesn't look like any Sifu I've ever seen. His movements are weak, and his horse stance is just a slight bend of the knee. He looks like a beginner, who filmed an instructional video in his garage.When I bought this video, I thought I'd be getting the tiger form I've seen before. Very low stances, with dynamic hand forms. It's called ""Tiger"" kung fu for a reason.I don't know what Lyons is doing, but it's definitely not a powerful Tiger form. I wouldn't even recommend this to a beginner, because Lyons just juggles the same 6 or 7 moves. I've seen children do better forms than this. Awful."
4,Shaolin Tiger,This Video was very fun to learn. I was able to learn the complete form in just 2 weeks!(results may vary) Now I practice the form every day and makes me feel more powerful with the figthing spirit of the tiger! This is a very powerful form if used correctly.
4,Springform Set,Very good for the price and the fact that you get three different sizes. Love the three sizes. Look forward to giving them lots of use.
4,A great set for the price.,"I needed a springform pan...I got three! So far they are working perfectly...I really like the non-stick coating, only time will tell if it lasts."
3,The largest one leaked a little,"I'm sort of new to baking with these types of pans, so I don't know if I'm doing something wrong. I made a fourless chocolate cake which needed to go in a water bath. I wrapped the pan in foil as instructed, and when it was done baking, some of the chocolate cake had leaked out (through the bottom) into the foil. It wasn't a lot. I'll still use it them, but I'll make sure to put something under them to catch anything that might drip out."
5,outstanding book,This is a must-have book for any witch or pagan. Cheryl goes into much deatil for the advanced witch or magickal practitioner. There is also a good selection of pages in the back for your own notes to add. Get this book when you can.
1,Boring and too coincidental,"I read this in one sitting, not because it was a page-turner, but because I just kept waiting for something to happen! The characters were flat and the relationships never really explored...It was also entirely TOO coincidental...The slowest part of the story is the ""meat""- the entire body of the novel - when ""Lucy"" is wandering throughout Greece etc...the narrative is not descriptive and often jumps and it is really hard to follow. I know the author is trying to get you into Lucy's frame of mind, but enough already. I was very disappointed and the ending was not that great either."
3,Fascinating reference...hundreds of typos & errors,"Detailed, rich history of Apple's industrial design.Given the effort that this book signified, I was very surprised at the hundreds of typos, and many other factual/historical errors which reduce Appledesign's credibility as a definitive reference.This book deserves a second edition, with better editing & fact-checking."
4,Get a whiff of Apple!,"Every Mac nut and design aesthete should crack the cover of this tome on how product goes to market. Some of the rejected ideas are more plausible than the ones that actually made it commercially.However, since this book contains so many pictures and is printed on very glossy stock be sure to bring a noseclip to your reading sessions! I got the impression the ink wasn't quite dry when they shipped it.Other than that, enjoy."
4,Great Pictures,This book has the most complete photo history of Apple's computer line that I have seen. Although it does not go into as much detail as I would've liked. Overall a great book to leave on the coffee table.
3,This title needs a new print!!!,"I refuse to pay these absurd prices for this book. I emailed the publisher, which is owned by another company now, if they could release another print run of this title, even a small run or something. Hopefully they'll take it under advisement. I'm sure they wouldn't have any trouble selling a few thousand copies, and I put that in my email too.I'd like to have the book, but it's not one that's worth more than 45.00. Certainly not 200+ It's just because it's out of print and hard to find and people are trying to make a buck. Do yourself a favor and not buy this book until they release another run. Maybe do what I did and email the publisher. Maybe if they get enough requests they'll do it."
1,a glaring problem with the book,"This book offers a comprehensive look at Apple's design, to be sure - and it's a story worth telling. However, the presentation is fundamentally flawed in that it reads like propaganda from the Jobs machine. The fact of the matter is that Jobs had very little to do with design at Apple, or with anything else that Apple did well, for that matter. The myth of Jobs is a nothing more than a fraud - an incredibly successful fraud."
3,book of eskimos,The book was what I wanted but there were of lot of marks and notes in the book. It was an old and very used library book. Not in as good a condition as a was let to believe.
5,Great Insight into Eskimo Culture,"I have read proabably every book ever written about artic people and this one by far is the best. Most of the others are ""western"" observations of eskimos form explorers or anthropologists, but in this book I think you actually begin to see things from their perspective and value system, which is a rare gift. Also because of the time it was written, no political correctness, so you get the real deal. The author has true affection for the Eskimo culturea and lived among them, not just observed. Although I personally never understood why people north of the arctic circle didn't just keep walking south or listen to uncle who had made it to florida I am grateful for this glimpse of life from bvehind their eyes and hearts."
3,Plays but couldn't rip to my computer,"The CD played OK, but I tried to download to my computer and only got about 4 songs, the rest would not rip."
4,"Good product, terrible instructions","We could not find a replacement for our square, recessed light in a store, so we ordered this product online. With some creativity, we were able to install it without cutting additional holes in the ceiling. It looks great and I'm so glad we ordered this replacement.My only negative comment about this product is the ""instructions"" (and I use that term loosely, in this case). The documentation was confusing, incomplete, and utterly useless. It's clear that the manufacturer assumed only electricians (who would not look at the documentation) would buy this product. Thank goodness my husband is an engineer, or we would have had to call a contractor just to replace a light fixture."
5,love it!,"What a hoot - funny for seat-belt advocates and for sci-fi buffs alike. A very close friend of mine was killed in a single car accident a few years ago. His passenger, who was buckled in, was unharmed. My friend, who was not buckled in, was ejected from the car and thrown 25 yards onto the highway and the impact killed him... so I'm always bugging people to buckle up... this is certainly a friendly way to spread the word and to remind people who are behind you in traffic."
3,Don't Buy - Available Free Online,"Paying $8.95 for this wonderful book is outrageous when you can download several versions for free from various academic websites, including Project Gutenberg. If you would like a low quality print edition - Great, go ahead and spend the money.Now, as for the content - The Crime of the Congo is a stirring account of atrocities committed in the name of King Leopold during the later half of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Valuable not only for it's content, Crime of the Congo is also a great example of a work produced solely for the purpose of educating people and inciting action against those committing said atrocities.Bit of a snooze at times, as Doyle (even in fine form), tends to ramble, but once again - a valuable read if you're interested at all in commentary about and the history of colonial Africa."
5,BUY THIS CD!,"I notice that every reviewer to date has given this album 5 stars - don't expect me to reverse the trend! Along with (the totally different) ""Music For A New Society"", this is John Cale's best work - and one of the great ""lost"" albums of the 70's (in fact, of all time). I have no idea what most of the songs are ""about"" - this is one of the few albums I know where the relative obscurity of the lyrics does not detract from the music's emotional qualities. BUY THIS CD!"
1,Sound Volume Defect / VERY LOW VOLUME,"If you buy this brand please be aware you better use the closed caption as the sound level is extremly low. I have tested several models and there just isn't any amplification of sound even when using the earphones.My advice is to go to Best buy and check out all the models in person and believe me, protron / spectron will be last on your list.Wish I could give it a Zero rating."
1,protron digital,"I don't know much of anything about this Protron dvd player because upon delivery to me i never recieved it instead I was sent a Venturer dvd player which doesn't even work and is in beat condition and doesn't even have the right accessories. This review is also based on the ""performance"" of the seller (harvo25). I don't think anyone should get a beaten unusable product."
4,A second great work by an under-appreciated genius,"Alfred Uhry strikes again with his second work examining racism and anti-semitism in the American South. In a clever twist, the playwright focuses on the prejudice of Jews of German decent against ""the other kind"" meaning Jews of Slavic decent. This infinitesimally subtle difference in ethnicity represents a world of difference in Southern Jewish society.Exploiting the significance of such a minor distinction, Mr. Uhry expertly exhibits the lunacy of every type of racism."
1,What's all the ballyhoo about?,"Mediocre garbage by the same guy who wrote ""Driving Miss Daisy"". Yet another mediocre play about Southern jews. There is probably a great book or play to be written about jews in the South, but this isn't it"
3,"Good album, not the same ole stuff but not as good as others.",I really like this band. But there tingy organ or whatever it is sometimes makes them sound less than what they really are. The vocals are great a indie rock duet isn't seen every day. If you replaced that organ with a piano it would get a bit more bearable.
3,Rare pair share wear and tear,"3 1/2Three albums in finds the ultra-catchy chemistry between a male and female drummer and keyboardist showing some limitations, compositionally and instrumentally. While possessing nearly half an album's worth of the band's exuberant, exhilarating best, constant musical and lyrical phrasings keep repeating themselves, underscoring the importance of future artistic growth to ensure continued critical success."
4,hinges for garage cabinet,Made some quick doors for a cabinet in the garage. These hinges did the job of attaching the hinges to the cabinets very easy. Nothing fancy but very effective.
4,Short but good!,"This was my first book by this author and I am pleased to say, I wasn't disappointed. The characters were well defined, their chemistry seemed real and the story was entertaining. My only complaint would be that it was a little short and wasn't as fast paced as it could've been. Sara and her son were running away from a long mentally abusive relationship and I hoped that the end for the villain was more thrilling but like I said, it was still a good book and I look forward to more!"
3,not impressed but not too bad,"Wife of JAG lawyer runs away from her controlling husband with their 10-yr-old son after he chokes their son's pet rabbit in anger. She asked Navy SEAL sniper to take them with him when he drives out to Oklahoma. He at first refused but later helps them run away. Both eventually have an affair even knowing that hero just re-enlisted 4 more years in the service & heroine's husband is actively looking for her & their son.This Melton book was just ok. The action-suspense part was tame & predictable. The romance & sexual chemistry was ok. Heroine was weak & passive-aggressive. She'd rather deceive, runaway, & cheat on her husband than face him directly about his controlling & emotionally abusive ways or just divorce him. Hero wasn't any better either, getting emotionally & sexually involved with an unhappily married woman.Partial recommendation only."
3,"Not bad, but not great.","After reading the first two books in this series I was really getting into the ongoing story line and was eager to read ""Westy's"" story. When I read this book it was ok, but didn't hold the same grip on me that the first two did. Would've liked to see the rest of the guys from Westy's SEAL unit involved in this storyline more."
3,"more suspense, not romance","I was expecting a good romance, and this book was a good suspense novel instead. The romance was ok, but not the focus and the scenes were nowhere as steamy as 'Next to Die' by the same author. I thought Next to Die was so awesome that I wanted to read her other books, but this one as the next book was disappointing. The hero is a good guy, but the goatee is a turnoff for me."
4,Well Pleased,"Time to Run (Navy SEALs, Book 3)This the 3rd in the series of Navy Seals Romance Book. It wasn't the best suspence of the 3 books but it did have good character developement. I would like to have known more about the seal involved in the story. You really didn't get to know much about him. He was introduced in the 2nd of the series. I like the way there is across over of characters in the books. I am already reading the 4th book in series.Love those SEALS"
1,the prints look like they were pulled from a fire,"if you have seen any of my reviews you know i like these movie packs and am willing to take a little less than a great print, but this set is just the worst i've seen yet. none of the movies were watchable as sound drops out for huge chunks of the movies and a dark scene is just the worst.save your money"
1,size chart is the worst!,"I bought this and many more items for my wife, and only this one didn't fit. the size seems to be for a child."
5,"Easy for an adult to listen to 1,000's of times!","I have 2 young children who adore this recording, and with that I have had to listen to it over and over, and I must admit I enjoy it like I have no other of this genre. I even find myself listening to it in the car even when the kids aren't with me! We all recommend them the highest!"
5,What A Deal!!!,"I just got this CD, and as always I was very impressed with Akira's guitar work. He's an outstanding guitarist! I found the songs very enjoyable on the 'Jealousy' part with Minoru Niihara singing, even though the verses were done in Japanesse. Very unique on how he's able to combine the Japanesse with American.Not much to say about the 'Slap In The Face', 'cos I've heard all the songs previously on the studio albums. But honestly I don't know why everyone hates Mike's vocals so much. I thought he did a good job with Loudness and he did a good job with Yngwie."
2,Dissapointed,"I was dissapointed to find out that the author teaches the continental method of knitting completely incorrect. English and continental methods are two very distinct methods of knitting with the same end result. She shows them as the same method only holding the knitting in the opposite hands. English knitters are ""throwers"" you throw or wrap the yarn around the needle, where continetal knitters are ""pickers"" you pick the yarn through the loop. If you want to learn continental method, do not buy this DVD. Get ""Knitting from start to finishing"" by Bev Dillon. - much more content in this DVD as well."
5,The Complete Beginner's Guide to Knitting - Review,I have recommended this DVD over and over again to other people for both children and adults. I found the teaching style for beginning knitting to be clear and concise. You do need the written form as part of the learning style. It helps you translate what you have learned from the DVD and allows you to apply it to other patterns. I bought this DVD because of the video snippets found at the author's website and I wanted something that taught both the english/american and the continental style. It covered what I thought I needed and so much more.
5,OMG - I'm KNITTING!,"I have been wanting to knit for a long time but I didn't want to pay for private lessons and I am a slow learner. So I have been putting it off for YEARS. I bought this DVD on a whim and I am SO GLAD THAT I DID! The gal who narrates the video is lovely, she speaks clearly and gives you lots of encouragement - as if you were in the same room. There are opportunities in each chapter to ""watch again"" without having to rewind and try and figure out where you got lost. I LOVE this DVD. After a few days of watching it I had the confidence to sign up for a lesson and knew that I would already have the basics down and get the most from my private lesson without the instructor having to go slowly through the basics. I have nothing but good things to say about this product."
4,Well received.,"A gift for my niece, which she asked for. I did not get to see her use it so my comments are limited."
5,Great DVD for learning,This is a great DVD for someone who has never knitted before. I was knitting within the hour and have two scarves half finished. The instruction is very clear and the DVD format allows for easily repeating the step if you don't quite master it the first time through. I'm very confident about turning out great knitted items after completing the rest of the video.
5,Awesome!,"I am so pleased with this DVD!!! If you want to learn to knit for under $20 (which I am sure is a lot less than taking multiple classes) then this is for you! Nici McNally is a great teacher and the production of the DVD is first rate- very easy to understand and follow along. Most importantly, if you are a visual learner, then you will totally appreciate this guided method of learning how to knit!"
3,Poor programing,The information is there but I found it impossible to navigate the chapters with my remote.
4,My niece thinks it's great!,"I got this for my niece for Christmas, and she says the directions are very clear and helpful."
5,The BEST knitting DVD,"I have many knitting DVD's, this was the first I bought and still my favorite. Nici shows you mistakes ALL beginning knitters make, how they happen, how to fix and prevent them. The film quality is very good, easy to follow. Her style is friendly, patient and professional. She covers all the basics. You really can knit, purl, fix mistakes and join seams after viewing. She demonstrates both Continental and English styles.This is a knitting primer - if you're a beginner, you NEED this one. Nici gives you the confidence in the basics to go on to lace, cables and fancy stitches, which are not covered. Don't miss this one!!"
5,Definately for Complete Beginniers,"This DVD is exactly what it says, not for ""beginning knitters,"" but for people who have never picked up a knitting needle before. That is exactly what I was looking for, and I now know how to knit. I think many people would be successful with this approach."
3,Basic knitting,"If you want to learn how to knit, get this DVD. I taught myself how to knit, in the comfort of my home, using this DVD .It will get you started and show you the basics. The patterns are perfect for beginners, easy scarfs, all basic knit and purlStitches. If you already know how to knit, this is not for you. I have tried books and other DVDs, but thisOne really worked for me. I would love to get her next one, beyond the basic, I think, but they keep changing the release date! I think she dropped off the planet, too bad, she is so good at teaching knitting."
5,Absolutely Fantastic!!,"This DVD, ""The Complete Beginner's Guide to Knitting"" is absolutely great. Nici has a warm, friendly style of teaching and the videos are so clear, it's even better than having someone personally teaching you. I can't wait for her future teaching videos. I love knitting, but I think I could learn anything Nici teaches. She does it so well."
5,Good start for beginners-,"Gave this to our 11-year old daughter. She had tried to get started previously with a beginner's knitting kit and booklet we'd bought from a large craft store, with no luck. By following this dvd she was able to get through the little hangups that kept confusing her, and was able to get a nice scarf going."
5,A Bright Shining Knitting DVD!,"I just read reviews of other knitting dvds, and I have to say that this one is amazing! It's so clear and perfect in its instruction. It does exactly what it says it will do: TEACH YOU TO KNIT! The camera shots are so close up that I see the teacher's fingerprints! You can see exactly what to do, there's no straining, no mystery. It's great!A friend had given me another knitting DVD (which, to be kind, I won't mention the name), and it was a nightmare. I almost gave up wanting to knit, but I loved the previews of this one (you can see them at their own website), and I bought it. I'M SO HAPPY! I can actually knit now.I highly recommend this DVD! Even if you already have one, or have knitting books, get this one too!"
5,GREAT FILM TERRIBLE VHS,I think they should put this fine film on DVD or at least VHS widesreen. The VHS available is terrible.
3,"its okay,but I just cant play it on my blu-ray dvd","I dont hate it, I already have a copy and I love it. The product is fine, but I just cant play it on my dvd.I did the troubleshoot thing, but cant work out how to change things...Guess I will just have to be more careful inwhat I order.Your service was great and it arrived well ahead of time...I just cant watch it.Christene Stapleton."
4,"Love the film , wish the DVD had more features on it though","I remember when I first saw this film - Melanie Griffith got to me . I hoped I would meet a woman like her character the next day . It didn't happen , but I can still go back to this film to relive the thrill .It's offbeat but will get you in due to the quality of the performances . The danger element of the story kicks in later on and builds up from there . If it's your sort of film , you will care what happens .The director's style will help keep you glued to it .I love it and hope you take the time to see it for yourself ."
4,"KINKY, CRAZY LOVE WINS","Jonathan Demme's kinky, crazy, off-kilter 1986 road trip starring Jeff Daniels, Melanie Griffith and Ray Liotta and noted for it's vivid cinematography by Tak Fukimoto, never misses a beat as it careens down the highways to eventual romance.Jeff Daniels is a strait-laced businessman having lunch at a downtown New York hole-in-the-wall diner where he meets cute, quirky, free-spirited Melanie Griffith and accepts a ride back to work that detours to a motel quickie (in handcuffs). This is just the beginning of a dangerous, fast-paced amalgam of thriller, drama, comedy (kind of) and love story that is really about what happens when two people reveal their secret selves. The unusually precise and perceptive soundtrack (David Byrne and others) adds immeasurably to the pleasure of this film experience. Ray Liotta in his feature film debut is a memorably menacing presence."
4,sexy.,"How sexy was Melanie in this? OMG. Remember this from when I was a child. Very entertaining, loved the music, one of my favourite films. Pity how she's gone down the drain.Would have loved more sex scenes though, they were awesome."
4,A delightful sexy road movie!,"""Something wild"" belongs to the well known genre of dazzling evasion so typical of hat colorful and irreverent decade. We shouldn't forget the acidic renovation of the British comedy (Brazil, Brian's life, Consuming passions) the surrealist Buffet froid (Bertrand Blier), the social satire Ariel (Aki Kaurismaki), (the embodiment of our inner dreams due the screen's magic) The purple rose of Cairo (Woody Allen), After hours (Scorsesse) or Choose me (Alan Rudolph).An alluring and outlaw femme fatale will turn out the successful life of a brilliant executive, at the moment they fall into a sudden weekend affair, with all the unexpected situations derived from a distorted mind at front the well planed schedule of the financial world.One of the most relevant exponents of this genre."
1,deceitful,"I had this movie sent to my nephew in Sarasota, unfortunately it would not play because MOVIE MARS sent the wrong region and to make matters even worse only refunded me the cost of the movie, I had to pay their shipping charges and additional shipping charges to send the movie back and they would not even exchange it. So as much as I wanted my nephew and wife to see this movie they were not able to watch it."
5,Victor: The Best!,"What can I say about Victor? He is simply the best! I definitely recommend this CD, it's a must have! He has all it takes to make it and wonderful fans who will make sure he gets there. So go out and buy his CD, you'll love it!"
4,Nice looking Watch at a Reasonable Price,"I am happy with this purchase. The watch is large, but not too large and nice looking. I really like that the watch is brushed stainless steel. The only negative for this watch is the band, which is suede leather. I would prefer a smooth leather band and will most likely get a new band. For me, the Timex logo is not a big deal."
5,Timex Expedition Watch,Exactly what I had in mind for a everyday watch. Easy to read (day or night). I would buy this exact same watch again.
2,Not Very Helpful,"I just returned from a trip to Tahiti and Moorea and used this book. So my feedback is specifically for those two islands. I must say the book was very spotty in terms of the quality of recommendations and its comprehensiveness. First, many of the locations that were recommended(restaurants/sights) were hit or miss. Second, I was so frustrated with the book that I went to restaurants that were unlisted and found them to be 100 times better that the author's recommendations. Which raised serious questions, ""why weren't these restaurants listed in the book?"" Moorea has a very limited number of restaurants and thus no restaurant should be excluded (Note: The restaurant was not new and the owner said it had been around for many years - just in case you were wondering).In addition, the book is not well organized when you're trying to look for things.I suggest you find another book if you're headed to French Polynesia."
4,Teenage Head,"A fabulous collection of original rock classics. Songs like Teenage Head are some of the greatest songs ever. It is no surprise Dave Edmunds produced many of the songs like ""yeah my baby"" and ""Between the Lines"" you hear this sound today in bands like Mondo Daio, Hives, Jet and others. It is a good fun album."
2,Not that groovy,Average Nuggets-inspired rock music. As a fan of music of the 60's and 70's I was hoping for better.
5,Flamin Groovies ROCK!!!,I love this CD. A terrific compilation of a little-known band who deserve more recognition. Lots of great cuts on this one!
3,Generic Carribean music,"One of the other reviews said this was pasteurized for Canadian tastes. That pretty much sums it up. It's pretty much cruise ship band music for older Canadians. It might work for a yuppie soccer mom barbeque with tiki torches in New Jersey, but it sure don't have a hint of authenticity. Having said that, you probably know most of the songs, can sing along happily, and hell, it is vaguely reminiscent of my last vacation."
3,Pasteurized,"This recording sounds a little like it was pasteurized for Canadian tastes. While it was recorded in the Caribbean, it does not sound like local artists were used."
2,Nothing New,"Writing short stories is difficult... this book did not have the insights or techniques to help me. Writing is a self discovery process, so just writing and writing is probably the best way to improve."
2,Gems within a sea of mediocrity,"Overall, I wasn't impressed by this book. The authors used a very broad definition of ""mystery,"" which one can easily see by reading the ""editorial review"" here. So many topics were covered, it was impossible to go into detail on many. Some ""mysteries"" were discussed in a single paragraph, while others spanned several pages.Yes, there were several points of interest throughout the book. But it was one of those that, had I not finished it, I would not have been disappointed."
4,Great reading,"I haven't read a boring book by this author. I don't think he has the ability to write a boring book. This is a ""page-turner."" Also, the guy doesn't make himself out to be some great hunter. He is humble, which makes me able to like the guy."
4,"It's not a trading system, it is a forecasting tool.","Delta is not a trading system. It says so right in the book. It is an interesting forecasting tool. It is difficult to go through the processes presented, but it is doable. Really opened my mind."
1,Please tell me this is not Welles Wilder of RSI and ADX,"I read a copy a friend had of this nonsense.I was very disappointed to see it was Welles Wilder of RSI and ADX fame. There is an article in the book where he said he wrote his first book because he needed money (he lost money trading) that book covered RSI and ADX!I do think both ADX and RSI have some value. If you look at RSI is mimics Z-Score (very closely) so maybe Welles being an engineer saw that and made RSI a version of z-score. ADX is very similar to moving averages...back this review.If you look at the charts in the book he writes the wave numbers 1,2,3...and so on. Then some of the charts show 1, 1... then 10, 10. Why is there a wave 1 and wave 1 again? He does not say.He must have been smoking something really good when he bought the rights to publish this total work of trash. I hope no fools paid him 35k to join his group. What a joke."
4,"Review of ""Making Harness""",I found this book to be most helpful not only in cutting and stitching whole harnesses but in the tools and their uses. It is quite clearly written and easy to follow. The items made are of a basic sort and this would not be a book for advanced harness making. The only facet of the book that irked me was the manner in which the author writes as in his tone of a kindergarten teacher talking to little children. A personal thing but I found it most irksome.
2,Critical missing information,"This is a good book on the leather working aspects harness making, and but for one critical detail, it would be a good book. What makes the book less than useful and potentially harmful to the horse is that there is NO information on fitting the harness/bridles/etc. to any particular horse. All sizing is done by weight, which as anyone should know, weight doesn't dictate body shape. Without any information on how to correctly fit what you make to the horse you're making it for makes this book woefully incomplete. Too bad."
2,Graphic SF Reader,"This book was very disappointing when it came out. The graphical novel craze was starting, and you had funky painting and things like that being popular, but the story, here, was just not very good, or anything other than a garden variety, run of the mill Batman tale. It was definitely not worth the money."
3,"Not so sure about it's ""Best of"" status.","Yes, the novel is really cool. Yes, the artwork is phenominal. And yes, Batman is nearly broken in this. But, really, would you consider this ""essential"" Batman? I am new to the scene, and have only read about 4-5 trade paperbacks, the last of which was The Long Halloween. I found Batman's dialogue to be trite and unintelligent, as Batman never is. It doesn't get dark until halfway through. I almost wanted to put it down at first read. It is worth getting, don't get me wrong, but not essential unless you like the visuals more than the story."
5,Lyrical Angst,"It is a hard truth that while comics have outgrown the pubescent superherogenre, it is the superhero comics that sell. This is a deconstruction ofthat loony vigilante, the batman. Dealing with superheros in an adultcontext, this book takes it about as far as it will go. Abuse, sexual anguishand psychiatric dissolution frame this well-worn character. The writing iscreepy and the art is absolutely beautiful. A masterpiece from two mastersof the craft.It's just a pity that it is batman. Both Morrison and McKean do superb work out of genre."
5,My favorite Batman story!,"I'm a HUGE fan of the Batman graphic novels and TPB, like this one! I remember reading through it when it first came out (I was probably 10 or 11) and I had to buy it a few years later when I was older and actually had money. Like Havok and Wolverine, the painted art drew me in, but it's also Morrison's incredible story.The Joker is insane, but so is everyone and everything else in the book. The art is just dark, painted and wonderful!"
3,"Creepy, but good.","This book is written in a very loose manner. The art is still painted pictures (beautifully done) with word balloons feeling like an extraneuos addition.The story itself mixes between Batman in Arkham (with all the inmates loose) and the founder of the asylum, Amadeus Arkham's descent into madness.All these aspects give you a true sense of creepy insanity while reading it. The kind of feeling you'd have if you were really there. (Which is what makes it so fun.)"
5,Batman- Arkham Asylum,"The book was in excellent condition. It was also in the bag and boarded just like it said in the add. Great seller!Just didn't know it was gonna have a different cover then in the add. Other then that, everything was great. And, I'm a happy customer. (:"
2,Pretty...,"...but then so are butterflies, and I wouldn't pay ten bucks for one of those. Not while African children's legs are rotting off."
2,Why was this supposed to be a masterpiece??,Here we go...I would have wanted more guitars - not necessarily distorted but imagine something like Coldplay;I would have definitely wanted a bettere technical production - this recording [is] a crying shame. Whoever did the mastering just scooped out the EQ and the result sounds hollow.. .a submarine bell allright! Vocals on some tracks are just hideously recorded... did they just take the demo scratch vocals & then built everything else around it?Unfortunately most of the stuff sounds dated and at the most sounds like an interesting demo. This leads me to thank Amazon.com for their support of second and third tier acts... I guess I'll have a fair chance of seeing my band's product distributed as well!...
5,How do you live?,"It is nearly two years since I bought this, and it is the only album I still must hear at least once a week. There is not once a faltering of quality, from the glorious sunburst that is the opening organ on ""Heavenly Pop Hit"" to the sublime fading chimes of the title track. It invigorates and captivates the soul, until one feels one is bleeding raw emotion and crying pure tears of 'joie de vivre'. The poetry and honesty of Martin Phillip's lyrics is unequalled. If everyone in the world listened to this, there'd be no more war or sadness, and we'd live for the dawning of the day."
2,It was small,"I was expecting a regular sized book and was surprized when I got this to find that it was only about 3"" tall with small writing. I was very diappointed."
4,Great introduction to operas.,"This book is a delight for anyone who doesn't know anything about opera stories, but wants to learn. Personally, I've listened to very little opera in my life because though the music is enchanting, I never could understand the meaning behind the words. I picked this book up in hopes that I could at least learn the stories of some of the better known operas and appreciate the art more. I now have a better appreciation for opera and partially understand the lyrics behind some of the best known operas. This book is easy to read. Not only that, but the stories are entertaining in and of themselves. It is a testament to the art they are derived from."
4,Good overview of fascism's rise and fall in Europe,"The reviewer from Redondo Beach, California is correct -- Eatwell's thesis that fascism is a unified political philosophy is not terribly believable. The fascists were power-hungry thugs who changed their rhetoric to gain votes, in both cases, Italy and Germany.That being said, I still strongly recommend this book as a good introduction to the roots of fascism. Eatwell's writing is lucid and his research of the behind-the-scenes politics is impressive.While I would have appreciated more on the ideology rather than the politics of fascism, apparently the ideology was almost a facade, so no deep philosophical questions need be raised."
4,trully the best modeling video,"this is definately one of the best modeling dvd's available ,i would recommend anyone who wants to learn maya ,to buy this"
1,artist,"The contents seemed to be interesting. Unfortunately, I had to return it. I couldn't watch the DVD because it made my computer crash constantly though I have one of the fastest speed computer in the current market."
5,Amazing,"This video is amazing. I struggle so hard for so long trying to make a decent human model and spent so much money on other books. This is great, its a perfect walk through on how to make a model. I'm on video 41 of 50 and its looking great and I've gained so much confidence that now I start to watch the videos and already know how to go about makeing the next part before he shows me. If you want to make human models then get this its perfect forget about wasting money on any of the books out there."
4,Girl reporter snags crush(get real #4) by linda ellerbee,Linda Ellerbee has done it again!! Trumbull is in serious trouble & everyone is too worried about the school dance. Is Casey cought up in the first-dance flu?? GET REAL!! She and Tyler Mkenzie ( the sweet dreamy crooked tooth one) work together to find out who the culprit that has been vandalizing the school is.
1,Winds of Confusion,"This was one of the first books I read about sail trim and I nearly gave up the sport on the spot. Conglomerating clippings from the magazine produced a very uneven book, sometimes conflicting, and frequently pitched to people of widely different experience. One chapter would assume years on the water while the next was aimed at newbies. Avoid this. Of the half dozen books on the subject I've read since, North U's sail trim book was easily the best. I'd suggest buying that instead. (And I'm still sailing.)"
3,Only average..,A few good songs but overall pretty poor effort. The album has a lot of poor quality songs. Probably my least favourite of the Dan Peek era
5,an oldy but a goody,I'm 45 but I remember this album as a kid.and some of thies songs bring back a flood of memories thank you
5,Beefheart's backwards music,"First of all this is a great and provoking album that any one who has heard and liked Captain Beefheart should own.That said, this is not a good starting point for neophytes. It is by far the Captain's most strange and difficult album. Only a few tracks will satisfy the casual listener (think ""Moonlight on Vermont"" and ""China Pig."") ""Trout Mask Replca"" is often cited as Beefheart's greatest album, and many agree. This causes people who are new to Captain Beefheart obtaining this album first, which can be an off-putting event.My recommendation is to first buy ""Safe As Milk"" and the ""Spotlight Kid/Clear Spot"" double. If you're happy at that point, verge into this album for perhaps ""Shiny Beast (Bat Chain Puller). There will be plenty of journey left!"
3,"I tried to like it , I really did , but don't listen to it much","I love the Captain's voice and lyrics , but listening to this music and enjoying it is a feat my brain has not yet performed despite trying a number of times over a number of years .It's great to have a 'Classic Rock' album, but I spend money on something hoping to want to hear it repeatedly .I prefer the Captain's other album CLEAR SPOT which , although sounding much more cleanly produced , still has the interesting arrangements and his voice .Try to borrow this from a friend before buying .You will hear an amazing voice and a talented band , but may not find more than that ."
1,The Emperor's New Album,"I've tried, honestly I really did give this album a chance, but 95% of the sounds on it are just not music. Okay, maybe that's a bit harsh, but to me (seemingly) random sounds are not music. I like albums that take a few listens before the magic starts to shine through, but I can really see no merit in this. Ever heard the story of the Emporer's New Clothes? Stop pretending to like this to appear knowledgable and hip.(...)"
1,"Calling it ""difficult"" is being disingenuous.","It's not that this music is hard to appreciate, it simply isn't music in the first place."
1,Wow.,"The first album I ever bought that actually left a bad taste in my mouth! I'm going to have bad dreams, I think. The UGLIEST music I've ever heard - like someone clubbing baby seals, but with bad rhythym. I wish I could get a refund on the time I spent listening to this."
1,This is the only album I've ever heard worth 0 stars...,"I can find some beauty or value in almost every experience, but this album is truly useless and depressing. I'm angered that I wasted my time listening to it so many times trying to hear something. There's nothing there!"
1,would rather sit in a dark room covered in bees (-50 stars),the experience of listening to this album is akin to having to crouch sober for 4 hours in a sewer with very stoned overprivileged 16 yr. olds thinking that they are saying very profound things.the only use this album could ever have in the music world is as a warehouse of samples.don't let it get you down.
1,This Blew Me Away All Right...,"It blew me clear back to a re-appreciation of the finer points of Donny and Marie's simple melodic pop again. This album is so universally bad on all fronts that all the previous 5 star ratings become worthless symbols. Don't take my word for it. Listen to the samples. Does it make you hunger for more than a 30 second bite? If so, go right ahead: buy it and write a five star review of your own. But for me, I'll take Donny and Marie over this any day. At least worthless fluff has some real cheese value. Worthless noise such as Trout Mask Replica is just an annoyance and a $[money] hole in your wallet.How can it be ""tuneless, raspy and very cryptic lyric-wise"" but also be ""a brilliant album""? Answer: it can't. It's just some hippies that wasted a year of their lives on a failed experiment. Don't waste even a minute of your lives on it! Repeated listenings do not help. Trust me."
1,Forget the critics,"Critics like to praise this album to make fun of listeners who take the album seriously. They know what the album is: junk. But they think it's fun to praise a piece of junk as ""art."" It's a practical joke on the masses. Don't let them fool you. This is just a joke, and a not very funny one at that."
1,how much coke did they do?,"Clearly these guys were working outside all limitations of musical style and format. But like classical composers who think all good tunes are cliche, if you refuse to make music then it's not music. Of course fans of this album are fine with that even though some would still refer to this album as a different kind of music. Shaking off the chains of convention is a declaration of freedom, just don't try to call it music. Music must be musical. If everything can be anything then nothing means anything."
3,"Original, creative but inaccessible","This is a very original album and I enjoyed it very much when it came out. It is difficult to recommend, however, because it just will not be accessible to many people. It never sold more than 35,000 copies despite heavy promotion and rave reviews. Buy it and listen to it if you can be open. It can be immensely rewarding but it will take a lot of getting used to. Like DaDa, the art form it resembles, it is an acquired taste. Difficult but brilliant."
1,Psychotic,I am now petrified to sleep in my own bed..you've seen horror movies..this is far beyond morbid..this is twisted and insane..and not in a good way...if your mobidly insane this is your CD OF CHOICE!
4,A test to take before buying this.,"If you enjoy Duchamp's ""L.H.O.O.Q"", buy this.If you wondered why M. L. had a moustache, don't.Anything else I can say about it is irrelevant either way."
5,Classic that influenced modern avant artists,"I was blown away when I first heard this considering when this was recorded. I immediately saw how this was a huge influence on modern avant artists. If you love this you must check out among others, The Lemon Kittens and Nurse With Wound. Tracks on the Lemon Kittens albums sound like they could have been recorded in this same session - especially The Lemon Kittens ""We buy a hammer for daddy"" album."
1,Ugh.,This album is what snipe hunting must be like. Everyone SWEARS that it's great fun - and they can't imagine why you're not enjoying it...What a joke.
5,a classic,"This is really hard music to get into. It sounds just awful on first listen, the kind of thing a bunch of toddlers jamming might come up with. However, I eventually realized, as many others did, that Beefheart is a genius, and this is probably the most unique album in rock music. So unique that I don't think anybody's ever tried a rip-off. It wouldn't work, in any case. Beefheart's inhuman growl plays against crazy jazz/blues avant-garde music for 80 minutes. Approach with caution."
1,The world would be a better place without it.,"It's so incrediby tiresome to read page after page of fawning reviews about this tripe. Don't fall for it. Van Vliet himself calls it ""a joke"". Don't let it be on you."
1,"Yeah, right.","I've got to say, even the 5-star reviews here make the album sound terrible. ""Out of tune, out of time signature, raspy voiced, atonal,"" (and these are the good reviews). I should have known something was up. Curiosity killed the cat, I guess."
3,old fart at play,"There is nothing that will prepare someone for this CD by Captain Beefheart, other than a good sense of humour. Trout Mask Replica is clever, perhaps too much so. Dated, yet, a landmark. Produced by Frank Zappa, it would be easy to dismiss as self-indulgent excess if it weren't that Mr Zappa and so many others were influenced. It's not all fun and games as there is a serious undertoe on some of the songs such as ""Veteran's Day Poppy"". If you are interested in bizarre, music from southern california of the sixties, this is it. My smile is stuck"
2,"I prefer my dark humour 2b structured, but do u?","The artist here is just getting some joy out of 'letting go' to the non-sensical part of human experience.Its the extreme opposite of say, classical music ...which taps into the well-defined emotions.Even if the emotion is negative in classical music, it tends to be smooth and clean, void of confusion.Here, each emotion is based in confusion, therefore the music itself follows suit.If you want to have a clear picture of what non-sensicality sounds like (not derogetory), you may enjoy this, and understand its shapelessness.Though in saying that, the humour here does have one consistency.It is 'dark' humour, expressed with a general vulgarity.I suppose I'm a sucker for 'structured' dark humour, which is why it didn't appeal to me, personally.But if structure ain't 'your' desire, who knows? This might be likeable to you.U must be able to stomach a bit of vulgarity, though."
4,An album that must be experienced,"A landmark work by the Magic Band. The music sounds like a desert with Beefheart's poetry the ghostly wind flying above. Listen to this if you have had enough of people telling you what improvisation is, or should be. I consider Trout Mask Replica as one of CB&TMB's three best works: _Trout Mask Replica_, _Safe As Milk_, and _Mirror Man_ (get the new Mirror Man Sessions if you can, as it is very successfully remastered and includes the excellent ""Beetle Bones & Smokin' Stones."") The track ""Ella Guru"" is among my favorite Beefheart compositions, along with ""Moody Liz"" and ""Autumn's Child.""Get this album."
1,Hadda Be Playing off the Jukebox.,"A vortex or a sinkhole?An elevated thing of beauty or a hopeless cliff?A secret society or a prank?A genius piece of work or a bad joke?I'm voting for all of the latters. Believe the bad reviews, this album stinks."
3,Randomness!,"Ok. This is random in the truest sense of the word. It's almost scary. If you don't like pure randomness, then you will probably be frightened of this album. Think carefully before purchasing."
1,Throw this trout back,"Zero stars if possible! All the worst parts of Frank Zappa's style of music wrapped up into one 70 minute abysmal nightmare. Nothing goes as far as being listenable, and any artistic endeavor is completely covered up by the gratuitous instrumental numbers that go absolutely nowhere."
5,your mother will hate this cd,"this cd is genius crazy hilarious. if you don't like it try britney spears or take a philosophy of fine art class. if you do like it try AMM for incredible underground avant-garde SOUND (read about them on allmusic.com, never met a real person who has heard of them), or karlheinz stockhausen or iannis xenakis for electronic avant-garde classical. my recommendations do not sound like trout mask replica but are beautiful and way out."
1,NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!,"Crush all internal and external destructive elements as the common enemy. As true today as it was when it was written, so many years ago. On behalf of your organization, please send a quarterly report and financial statement for the period, October 1 - December 31, 2002.Thank you."
1,Close this freakshow down for repairs,"What an out of tune bunch of nonsense! This must be the bearded lady of music. If you like this sort of thing, knock yourself out. I like craziness as much as the next guy, but I'm never going to go home and swallow any swords (nor listen to this album again)."
1,The next Mozart? The best album of all time?,"Please. Another reviewer termed this ""for pseudo-intellectuals who need a life"". I'd like to second that. Smarten up! You're no better than schmucks who like Britney Spears. They like it because everyone else does; you hate it because everyone likes it. You like this album because no one else does. That doesn't make you any more original or intelligent than Britney Spears fans! What a crew of sheep you are. Get a life."
1,"Trout Mask Replica is pants, IMHO","All I can say about Trout Mask Replica is: Pants, pants, unutterable pants.Out of the 28 tracks, not a single one avoided having its preference individually set to poor (the MP3 tag I use to denote ""Don't play me this when I ask for music"").I was very disappointed with TMR after the hype I had been given about it. It one of the few CDs I ever actually spent more than 15 quid on and if I could sell it and get some of my money back I would. Never before have I thought an album so bad that I would consider actually selling it.It has no redeeming qualities, it isn't funny, it isn't interesting, it isn't ironic, it is just pretentious drug crazed bollox. I have known belches with more musical or poetic value.Mark.........."
3,polarizing,"I've never known an album to polarize listeners the way ""Trout Mask Replica"" does. Literally, you'll either love it or hate it. I've known people who are at the forefront of experimental music who got physically ill when this album was merely mentioned, and I've known people who worshipped Styx and thought this album was great. Personally, I think about half the tracks could be eliminated and you'd end up with a better representation of this phase of Captain Beefheart's career, which was so outside the box that there was no box."
1,a real stinker,"This CD sucks...I've tried to like it because I like other stuff the Captain has done, but thuis just stinks up my CD collection"
3,"Different,Refreshing Stuff.","Endless jagged lines of screwed monotony,harped up by occasional hooks spliterring with half-greatness tip-offing to overall musical impressiveness & ability.Lyrics running,hiding,reappearing with the Captain,no,his dark long-haired peeled limb pointing,standing sideways,colors going,meaning,substances,weirdness,air playfulness childlike unique comparison world night time clay.Scattered pieces juggled mindrops collapsing tornado whirls clanging pots teaspoons gravel fair-beautiful,manic,thunder.All hail the Captain.My rating for this is 3 & a half stars."
5,Superb,"Once you break through the surface strangeness, this will change the way you hear music forever."
1,The worst CD I've ever heard.,"Forget the ""spotlight"" reviews - they're obviously incredibly self-serving. This CD is, simply put, the worst CD I've ever heard. It has no redeeming qualities, not as an influence, not as interesting or avant-garde, not as a post-modernist experiment, it just sticks. What is even more disappointing is the fact that people fall all over themselves trying to convince you that it's great. It's not. Don't waste your time on pretentious jokes like this."
1,Just make it stop!,"Yawn. This album has two serious problems, both of which would be forgivable if the other wasn't present. First, it shows nearly no musicality (and I'm not just talking about harmony or melody, but the presence of any kind of music). Second, it is terrifically boring. I can't think of any circumstances that would cause me to listen to it again.Back to the loch with you, Nessie."
1,It's art indeed.,"But bad art is worse than good non-art music. This is the worst kind of art in the world: pretentious, inane, and poorly performed. Give me music over art if this is what art looks like. If you want something difficult but beautiful, listen to Sigur Ros or GYBE or Men's Recovery Project or pretty much anything else. This is difficult and painful, with no payoff whatsoever."
1,Where's the zero stars button?,"I cannot believe that I'm listening to the same album that everyone else is. This thing was terrible! Where did all of these 5-star reviews come from? This must be some kind of joke - I heard about it from an art student, and mayhap this is a dadaist prank, but that doesn't make it good music."
1,Least Essential Album of All Time,"This album should never have been made. I bought it on the recommendation of a co-worker, but I was left almost angry after poisoning my ears with this tripe. I was warned that I wouldn't like it the first time I listened to it, but this exceeded all expectations. I'll not be bothering with this again any time soon."
1,"Even if I live forever, I'll not be listening to this again.","Considering how much it costs to get an album nowadays, you can't really justify throwing something away. Then again, you can't really justify listening to this album twice. Here's a tip: if your friends tell you that this is the best music ever made, borrow their copy first. If, after that, you decide you can't live without it, then buy it - but make sure that you don't buy this solely on the strength of someone else's recommendation, or you may make a tragic mistake. The more you know."
1,A Baffling Ordeal...,"Definitely not 3-chord pop, and not the pablum that you hear on the radio. This is why I was attracted to it in the first place, but this is just a cacophony. It's either a work of genius or a waste of time. I'm voting for the latter."
1,"Get down, get down (to hades)","I finally discovered the origin of that get down, get down expression as it relates to music. This is as far down as music can possibly go, to the point of not being music at all anymore. Beefheart was just trying too hard to show us the beef, and not hard enough to show us some heart. This album stinks."
1,Never mind this bollox!,"How wonderful that there are some coherent one-star reviews to read, agitating against the nonsense! Sort the reviews by ""most helpful"" and see what you find. The rating is being artifically driven up by a crew of unskilled pranksters (which I suppose is appropriate considering the album itself). Never mind this horrible mess of an album and listen to some real music."
1,Poor misguided folks,Mega-garbage hand crafted by non-musicians for pseudo-intellectuals with built-in cloth ears.Also recommended:Lou Reed Metal machine MusicMiles Davis Bitches Brew(the 4 disc box set with ultra long bonus tracks for extended torture).Get it yet?
1,Staggering achievement on its own terms,"Beefheart succeeds in perpetrating a massive musical joke at the expense of those pretentious critics who know nothing about music but like stuff simply because other people don't. He deliberately sets out (as stated in a recent interview) to create ""the most unlistenable garbage ever created"" and then sets back to wait for the plaudits. If you have friends who know nothing about music, and want to appear to have exclusive tastes, then this album is for you. If you want music to listen to, then stick to Beefheart when he's trying to create music, not having a joke at your expense. Unconditionally Guaranteed is a good start. 5 stars as a statement, 1 star as an album."
1,Take this down!,"Let's work together to make sure that no one confuses this with real music... Pretentious and boring, nonsensical and a colossal waste of time - this is the worst ""album"" I've ever heard."
1,Humbug!,"I say humbug, and ask that anyone who disagrees with it look the word up in the dictionary before they write another stupid 5-star review. The point is this: you can either believe that it was carefully constructed (in absolute ignorance of the facts), in which case my comments are sour grapes, or you can believe that this album is a hoax, in which case my comments are the only valid response. Take your pick, but don't shoot the messenger. This album is humbug in the worst sense of the word."
1,!!!!!!!!!!,"Nonsense and hoi-polloi. Atrocious stupidity, and a waste of time to boot. Here's a tip, sort the ratings by most helpful, and see what you find. This album is a joke, and a few jerks are trying to raise its ratings artificially so that more people get taken in. It's mean, and it's a lousy thing to do to someone else. All of the good reviews admit that it's arrhythmic, atonal, raspy, gritty, bad musicianship, with bass that sounds like someone falling downstairs, etc. Think to yourself: how could this be simultaneously so unpleasant to listen to, but also worthy of 5 stars? Of course, it can't be. It's a stupid prank, and so are the 5 star reviews. Half the time they insult your intelligence, and the other half of the time, they try to make you insecure. Trust me, you'll be a lot better off without a nonsensical headache like this in your collection.-Paul-"
1,Music for chumps.,"There have been several reviews that say it better than I could. I'll just quote one: ""for pretentious pseudo-intellectuals who need a life."" I'm just adding my review to bring the rating back down where it belongs."
1,...or it could just be the worst album ever recorded,"you be the judge, sample the results and save your money."
2,Planktonite my concubine,You probably have to be quite good to be this bl00dy awful!ps. 2 stars because it made me laugh...and I don't know why...
1,Total Noise Pollution,There are many many many overrated albums out there in the music market (and many underrated ones for that matter) and this is defnitely the most overrated music album out there (if you can even call it a music album)! I dont care what all the magazines say and i dont care what all the reviewers think ; how can you actually sit down and listen to this album and actually enjoy it? Its a total waste of time!
1,Music? Not Hardly,"In my honest opinion this is the most unlistenable album I've ever heard and it resembles music only to the extent that a 4-year old's crayon scribblings resemble fine art. Taken in the context of the period of its release it seems to be about nothing other than 'shocking the straights'. Call me square if you want but the ability to make weird noises with musical instruments does not a genius make.On the other hand, if you're a fan of Frank Zappa you may find this right up your alley."
1,horrifying,"this guy is completely insane, and not in a good way that suggests artistic genius ala thom yorke or something. my friend once told me that he locked people up at a commune and forced them to learn to play instruments for this guy, and that he frequently abused them in the endeavors to record his music. morbidly curious, i checked it out and the torture certainly comes through in the music"
4,Still relevant after all these years,"I bought this as vinyl when I was 13 because I read a review in my big brother's Village Voice. It was different than anything I had ever heard, and still is. I bought it on impulse when I saw it on Amazon, and am glad I did. Somewhat bizarre, but some great music. If you like old Zappa."
5,"With every repeated listen, this album gets better!","This album is truly magnificent. Like most people's experiences with this album, it rarely sounds good the first listen. It first sounds musically atrocious, but it slowly gets better. I think thats where they got the name ""Magic Band"" fron. It is pure magic. Dachau Blues, Ella Guru, Moonlight on Vermont, and Sugar and Spikes are my favorites, and Veteran's Day Poppy may have the most emotionally moving lyrics ever written. This is a must buy for any listener willing to be amazed. It is truly rewarding."
1,definately an aquired taste,"OK.. Through the years of my youth I heard so much about Captain Beefheart. When I was young it was hard to get his discs but I finally was able to get SAFE AS MILK. Eh... it didn't thrill me. Delta blues with a bad band and a bad voice. However, since I was a Zappa fan I knew Frank produced TROUT MASK and I read that it was in Rolling Stones Top 100 albums (this was in the early 80's when the journalism in Rolling Stone was credible and not the tripe it is today) I felt it would be worth getting. After seacrhing high & low I found it - and boy was I disappointed. It was unlistenable. To me it was a mess!!! It was painful. But I don't want to totally write it off because it does have an artsy-fartsy appeal to it and some listeners may dig Beefhearts odd poetry and the bad musicianship. I didn't dig it, but you may if you like stuff that's really out there."
1,Like an epileptic seizure set to music!,"Sure, there were a lot of epileptics that have done good work (Dostoevsky among them), but I can't think of a single one who did their good work DURING their seizures... There's no other excuse for musicianship as poor as this. To Captain Beefheart: either learn how to play, or take some epilepsy meds."
1,What the...???,"I don't really need to justify my response, I don't think. My reaction is/was a visceral one, and even if I'd never heard music before in my life, I wouldn't like this album. The experience is kind of like putting your tongue on a 9-volt battery - you don't need any fancy explanation for why it is unpleasant - and nobody could ever persuade you otherwise."
1,Beware!,"Listen to this at your own peril. Be suspicious of albums like this - the crazy, cult following (and the music itself) is more as a result of the desire to be the weirdest of all then any actual desire on Beefheart's part to express his true musical self. This is as bad as it things could possibly sound - and it hurts me to say that because we love Frank Zappa. This album, however, is a blot on his (and humanity's) name"
1,Another Waste,"It's hard to find decent MAYA books that can guide you through efficient workflow and professional techniques. I found this book to be suitable for forensic animation, and not much else.Instead, I recomend:Stop Staring: Facial Modeling and Animation Done Rightby Jason Osipa"
4,A great book for modeling with nurbs.,"When I first looked at this book I was immediately put off by some really awful looking models that appear throughout the book. Apparently they are done by different people; not the author. However once I started reading it, I realized it has some excellent tips on how to manipultate and build bipeds with NURBS. The tips work great on quadripeds too. It explores different methods to NURBS modeling, so if one way does not work for you there are others that might. Bottom line, this book is a few years old and the models are not the best from an artist's standpoint, but they are made technically well which counts in rigging.This book is too low in price for a modeler not to pick it up and add to their reference collection."
4,had to read for a Class,"I had to read this book for class, but unlike forced reading I actually liked this book. It is essential reading for the betterment of the feminist movement. The book is an illustration of how we all come together to sort things out."
2,Bad clip,"This clip is the WORST clip i have ever seen. I suggjest that the persone who is selling to slow it down with this ""Shark Week"" clip because what about the girls who have a vidio now they need to see some deceant clips that boys would also want to watch. So, slow down the selling of this clip and sell some more versionse ove every thing, but please make some more SpongeBob clips. ""I hear that a lot of people like him."""
4,Hot Oil Treatment,"This stuff is great for my naturally curly/thick/frizzy hair. It's really cheap too for 3 bottles. I've seen some stuff for almost $4, and there were only 2 bottles in there.When I blow dry my hair I end up having to wash, blow dry, then straighten. The whole process is over an hour long. But when I use this I usually only have to straighten a few locks of hair.The reason I gave it 4 stars though is because usually after the second wash I give my hair, it seems to wash out. I end up having to straighten my entire head of hair. I spose that's cause my hair is really thick and curly, but maybe also cause I only use it like once a month, when it says to use once a week.But I'll definetely use this product again, and I recommend it."
4,"Very good book to guide patients, families through treatment","Betty Rollin's quote on the cover of this book sums it up: ""Here are the facts -- clear, unterrifying, and important."" I purchased this book for myself and my mother when she was diagnosed with breast cancer. I wanted us both to be able to read about her disease and learn more about what was going to happen to her without being frightened by statistics and other people's case histories. We have both benefitted from this book because it has helped us to understand the whirlwind of activity that followed her diagnosis. The book is not a comprehensive medical reference; there are other books that do a better job of going into detail (like Dr. Susan Love's Breast Book). But as a readable ""guidebook"" or handbook to help patients and their families understand the steps involved in the treatment of breast cancer, this book is a very good investment."
5,Great book,My sister in law gave this book to me when I was battling breast cancer. I felt the need to give this same book to a friends daughter who is going through her own battle with breast cancer. This book answered so many of my questions and explained the exact process I would be going through. I recommend this book to any woman battling breast cancer.
2,Not what I expected,"Based on the title and summary, I thought it would give information from female doctors about their trials and learned knowledge on the way to becoming a doctor and once they got there."
2,Amazing Player - Poor Teacher,"The guy is an amazing player, but he is not a teacher. I caught on right at the beginning that he had great difficulty slowing his own licks down. If you want to get a closer more direct look at his licks (at full speed) then this video is for you. If you were expecting more of a teaching session that broke down his playing and licks, this is not for you. The video could have really used a good teacher sitting with him pulling out details like I have seen done in other videos (like Steve Wariner's DVD)."
2,Short on instruction,No doubt this guy can play but DVD provides almost nothing in the way of 'instruction'. There is a distinct lack of 1/2 speed and slow passage runs. Almost all exercises are played at full break neck speed which very frustrating to the learner. The info on Brent's guitar and gear is interesting but this is not what an instructional DVD is all about.
5,Informative and very interesting,"Whereas I'll admit I didn't read the three screenplays in their entirity, seeing how the stories evolved really fascinated me. Bouzereau includes quotes and insights from Lucas himself that really add to the integrity of the text. It was really interesting to imagine how stories that influenced a generation so profoundly could have been. This book is required reading for the die-hard Star Wars fan."
3,There has to be better,"Although the text book gave helpful informtion it did so in a boring manner. There is almost no change in font size - even for headings or sepration between sections and absolutly no color or pictures. There i no reason a textbook this simple can not be offered as an ebook!The writing was even dryer than the formating. Most students in my class stoped reading it very eary in the class and those like me have great difficulty focusing on what they are trying to say.Even my professior deviates a lot from the book. I have never read chapters so mixed up, and that is saying something."
4,fast and easy,"I was hesitant to order a textbook online, but my grown daughter told me I was silly. I jumped in with both feet and ordered the book, saving $68 from my university bookstore price. I will do it again!"
1,Dishonest,"I bought a textbook from them last semester. There was a portion blacked out on the front cover. It was a used book so I hadn't thought anything about it. However, I have been trying to sell the book back only to find out that it is the instructors edition! The different ISBN and title had been blacked out on the cover. Nobody will buy this book back. They should check their books before they send them. I do not recommend this seller at all."
1,Ha,"Not all businesses can be run without ""going there"". If all a company handles is information that can be zipped through the internet, it might be fine. But you can't send a car through email or a conference call."
4,Vice President,"I have spent 17 years in selling Information Systems and had to travel alot for meeting which took me out of my territory but with the concept of this book implemented alot of time, money and effort could have been saved - I have recommended that we implement this concept - very good book"
1,Not What I Ordered,The item delivered was not the Fulton Mailbox. It was several Support Brackets for something totally different. But Amazon was prompt in getting me a return label and refunding my money. Still a pain to have to return a item.
5,A Great Guide to Simple Imaging,We have had a telescope left unused in our back shed for many years because we had simply lost interest and time. A friend told us about the book Video Astronomy so we decided to buy it and try out the techniques. Both my husband and I were amazed that we could record the moon and some of the planets so effortlessly using low cost video cameras used for security. The book has a nice simple guide to building your own camera with parts you can find at a local electronics parts dealer. We did this and were delighted at how simple it was to use. Our interest in at least using our telescope has been renewed since reading this informative little book. We highly recommend it to anyone wanting to take pictures of the planets and the moon.
2,Video Astronomy book,"The title to this edition and the first edition published in 2000 offer a book that has relatively little to do with video. Both editions are astrophotography books, and only use the video camera to capture multiple images to stack and make better astrophotos. If your looking for premier advanced video techniques, leads to low cost top end video cameras, methods, techniques and software, then seek out the leader in video astronomy - the International Occultation Timing Association and its related websites. IOTA's free book on occultations and video techniques is here: http://www.poyntsource.com/IOTAmanual/Preview.htm"
5,The Days of Wine and Roses,"Man this book is such a guilty pleasure for me. I love how Sugerman can weave Rimbaud/Baudelaire, William Blake, William Burroughs, Jim Carroll and Axl Rose. A lot of us were living on the nighttrain to the ""Palace of Wisdom"" back in 1989. That was my season in hell with GNFR as the soundtrack. Although Axl has revamped them as a karaoke group, it makes you wonder what might have been. Guns and Roses was truly onto something legendary if they didn't implode. But hey wasn't it inevitable. No one in music today is even close to the insanity of pre-illusion Guns. Only the Lizard King's Homer could mythologize the late 1980s of the Sunset Strip. RIP Danny"
2,Not very interesting,"This book provided only a handful of facts about GN'R that all GN'R fans dont already know. IF you are looking to learn certain things about the band, you will not find them in this book. This book does nothing more than give a very drawn out detail of how cool Danny Sugerman thinks Jim Morrison is. All of the comparsion between Axl and hindu gods s very boring, honestly. If you are a true GN'R fan, you should not buy this book."
1,"boring, with a bunch of bs about gods and axl","This book blows! I wanted a biography of the sex, drugs, n rock n roll that was gnr. What i got was a boring book on hindu gods and jim morrison."
1,Save your money,"I am a die-hard Guns N Roses fan.I've been a fan since they were a club band playing on the Strip and I've seen them live about 50 times, before and after they made it. I bought this book because it was written by one of the guys who wrote the definitive book on another rock star I liked...Jim Morrison.There's no ""Insider's knowledge"" to be gained here. It's all third party sources (he didn't even get the quotes right from the 89 concert with the Stones and Living Color in LA...I was there BOTH nights in question!). Instead you get comparisons to Morrison...psycho-babble about psychology and religion...and pretty much a waste of money. Although the jacket pics of Sugerman trying to look and dress like Morrison are actually quite laughable!Take $5 out of your pocket and wipe with it for the same effect.Thank God Sugerman is not writing anymore."
1,Carried Away,The author of this book gets carried away to say the least. He strays far from actual facts and delves into his crazy theories and parallels of Axl and Slash (forget about the other members in the group) and some ancient figures. It got quite tedious at some points and was not interesting at all. Buy another GnR book!
2,GNR or Mythology?,"If you're looking for a GNR book, try another, many other books are better! Some parts are interesting, others are boring to death. It's not a good ""first GNR book"" but if you have many, it's an interesting addition to your collection. Kinda disapointed though."
1,Cute but Useless,"My neice got this as a gift and the handles had to be connected to the mop and broom head, problem is that they don't stay on. Not even a little bit. How is a young child supposed to use a broom with a head that falls off? I got this toy because it got good reviews. Either they don't care or the toy we received is missing something."
5,I would definetly recommend it!,"If your looking for peaceful, relaxing music you've got the right CD! If you've had a rough day at work and just want to lie down and rest, this is the perfect music to set the relaxing atmosphere! As your thoughts slowly venture off into space you will soon forget all your worries until your fast asleep..."
4,A Bargain Blast!!!,"Anyone wanting to spend the minimum currency for this bombastic side of Tchaikovsky need not look further! In addition to the three warhorses you get the rarities Cossack Dance from ""Mazzepa""and the ""Coronation March"". This compilation is fitting homage to Eduardo Mata whos' untimely death at 53 cut short the career of an up and coming conductor. The recording is billed as surround sound. That I'm not sure but the dynamic range is wide and nothing is exagerated. The ""1812"" features well defined carillon and cannon thuds. The ""Slavonic March"" begins sluggish emphasising the theme and the ""Romeo"" is affectionately detailed throughout. Gee! You can pick this disc up for less than a gallon of gas! Only the most particular audiophiles will need to pay more for their favorite heart throb maestro."
3,A Nice Introduction to the Potter Series for Toddlers,"A very simple board book introducing some of the characters in Beatrix Potter's wonderful series, illustrated with her original drawings, and giving the noises that each animal makes. The book, like others in this series, has an unusual shape which makes it interesting for little hands to feel but difficult to fit in a standard board-book-sized box. These have no literary value in themselves, but they should do well to help young readers recognize and enjoy the full Potter stories, which can be a little intimidating because of the old-fashioned language."
1,Way too small!,"I thought this would be a great transitional diaper bag. I was mistaken. It is SMALL. There was barely any room in it. I had enough room for an outfit change, a couple diapers and some wipes. I had to squeeze a color book and a couple tiny toys in it to entertain my kiddo. I used it for a month before upgrading to a bag that I found on sale at Target. For the space that you get in this bag, you'd be better off carrying a reusuable grocery bag!"
1,The music of racism,"It is exactly this type of music that perpetuates the degrading and predatory stereotypes of Hawai'i. The whole cd -- and others like it -- is packaged in the same way tourism is packaged: Hawai'i is a sweet, safe place with a servile culture, peaceful history, and disconnection from the ""real world."" Don't believe any of it. Hawai'i was invaded by the United States in a military coup and native Hawaiians subsequently stripped of power and respect. This is the music of that domination -- like all insidious racism, it is perpetuated ""innocently"" by reducing an entire people and culture to a cartoon. The real Hawai'i lies beyond Diamond Head in Makaha, Moili'ili, Hanalei. If you want to really know Hawai'i and Hawaiian music, purchase the music of Keali'i Reichel and Israel Kamakawiwo'ole and really listen to them. You'll be doing yourself and a millenium of a strong people a favor.And while you're at it, go look up the author Haunani-Kay Trask!"
4,Music of Real Hawaii,"Reeve's review which termed this the music of racism couldn't be more wrong. Having lived 30 yearsin Hawaii I can tell you that this is the real thing embodying the spirit of aloha. Mr. Reeves has had his brain corrupted by the racism and greed of Haunani Trask, an part-Hawaiian lawyer, professor and female chauvanist. The modern music he talks about is just Hawaiian hippie junk mixed with the music of a very few talented people."
5,All the best from Hawaii,This is the best 20 selections from Hawaii for [this price] on the market today. It covers the whole range of music played in the islands.
4,Hawaii-licious!,"For the price, this is a nice collection of instrumental and vocal Hawaiian tunes. This package lacks liner notes, so ""who knows"" who sang that lovely version of ""Lovely Hula Hands?"""
3,Not Rick Steves,"I was looking for a Rick Steves like guide to New Zealand - a book that concisely told where to go and where not to go. I had heard that other Rough Guides were like that, but this one is like most guide books - tells about everything with recommendations about what's best, hard to find. A good book to use as a reference but not quite what I was looking for."
5,Great Book,"I traveled to New Zealand in late 2004 and carried 4 guide books. I found Rough Guide New Zealand the best for its in-depth coverage of places that were barely mentioned in the Lonely Planet book. During our 1500-mile road trip I was constantly referring to RG & LP as my wife drove, so in effect I compared the two books' descriptions for the southern half of South Island. There was absolutely no question which guidebook did a better job....Rough Guide. Towards the end I barely used Lonely Planet because RG was more informative 90% of the time, and more interesting in its style of writing. It has 300 more pages than Lonely Planet, too.The maps are better than those in previous Rough Guides, and even the photos are quite nice now. This edition has a great listing of highlights for each region (very handy). I highly recommend Rough Guide New Zealand."
3,"Heaps of info, but quite unreadable.","I bought this book out of a recommendation from a friend for my long trip to New Zealand. I lived there for six months and harly used the book at all. The pictures are great, and where it lists the highlights is good too. I simply found the book unaproachable and it's format difficult. One road trip with another traveller who had a lonely planet New Zealand guide had me leafing through the LP one more in one weekend than I had this Rough Guide in six months. I'm not saying the info is innacurate, but the book just took up room in my bag. New Zealand is pretty user-friendly as it is, you don't need a Guide book that isn't."
5,Most detailed and accurate guide book we bought,"We bought many NZ guide books (we took a 3 week trip with our three young children in December 2005) and the Rough Guide was the one that we ended up using the most. We carried it everywhere we went (we mainly drove around the South Island and stayed in over 10 towns). Yes the print is a little small but the content is totally accurate and we got used to using the book as we drove from town to town. Where other books merely ""list"" restaurants and give price ranges, the Rough Guide goes a step further and often gives a brief description and/or opinion on the ambience and the food. (we found the descriptions of the accomodations and and eateries to be right on). I would definitely purchase a Rough Guide book again next time we plan to travel to another country."
1,Not like volume I,"If you enjoyed Volume I, you will be greatly disappointed in this one. It is too bad that I could not listen to a few songs before I purchased it. I would not recommend this one."
3,à découvrir,"A découvrir. Ce ne sont pas des originaux (certains oui), mais aussi enregistrés en public. En tout cas, très belles musiques sur les morceaux. Je ne suis malgré tout pas déu mme s'il existe des compilations italiennes supérieures."
4,Bodier is a very magnetic vocalist in the Latin jazz idiom,"Mariette Bodier has a voice that is immediately appealing. Some pieces have only the accompaniment of guitar, or guitar and percussion. On ""Besame Mucho,"" I would've preferred a more acoustic guitar sound rather than one from a plugged in instrument with pickup. Gil Sanchez' guitar on ""Un Poco Mas"" is a treat. Bodier's three original compositions are arranged with fuller accompaniment and were recorded in New York. Bodier is a very magnetic vocalist in the Latin jazz idiom. (Joe Ross, Roseburg, OR.)"
1,update of my previous review,"The content of Adam Hutchins' DVDs is probably second to none; it is clearly better and significantly more useful than very popular Brazilian JiuJitsu DVDs and others. Adam deserves even more than 5 stars.Also, 5 stars for the superb customer service of MasterMedia; they sent me promptly a replacement DVD + a bonus one.I am giving the set 4 stars because ""chaptered"" DVDs would be better/easier to use.Please disregard my previous review (I bought the set as a present, and disk #1 would not play - it was kind of embarassing to be told there was a problem).I was irritated, but subsequently I found out what a great company MasterMedia is; I will certainly buy other items from them.Please disregard the 1 star rating; it seems that I cannot change it. The real rating, as indicated above, is 4 stars for the DVD set, and even more than 5 stars for Adam H."
5,An excellent read,"Having been Lubavitch, I read Levine's book as both former insider and outsider. Her portrayal of the Lubavitch world captured its essence, and her description of the variety of personalities within it was also apt. Unlike an earlier reviewer, I considered the deliberate care taken to obscure the identities of the girls to be important and in keeping with academic ethics.The Lubavitch world holds within it a certain comfort and certainty, simply because all the answers are there. Unfortunately, as we read in the cases of several of the girls portrayed in this book, there is little to no place for the girl or woman who thinks critically, questions the tenets of Chabad-Lubavitch, or who is called to higher education. For example, I wonder if one of the women portrayed ever completed her medical training.An excellent study that offers the reader insightful glimpses into the world of Lubavitch girls."
3,"Mystics, Mavericks, and Merrymakers","I thought this book was overwritten. The main characters were not main characters in Crown Heights. I picked the book because I know a few Labavitch young woman and they were expertly brought up by their parents. Feel comfortable in the ""outside"" society."
3,Sociology Research,"This is clearly just the publication of the author's thesis work, not well re-worked for more general consumption. Very repetitive and poorly edited."
2,"Lots of words, little depth","After reading the many positive reviews about this book I was very excited to start reading it, however I was very disappointed by the lack of the depth in the portrayls of the young women. The author spent over a year with these young women and yet tells us very little about who these women really are. She presents a surface level look at the young women of Crown Heights that could have been summarized in a 50 page thesis, instead of drawn out into this 230 page book that hardly clues the outsider into the world of a young Lubivitch woman. The author also fails to accurately explain some critical Orthodox rituals/beliefs, which I found extremely disappointing. If you are interested in Hasidic Jews, I would recommend The Rebbe's Army : Inside the World of Chabad-Lubavitchby Sue Fishkoff, Real Jews: Secular Versus Ultra-Orthodox: The Struggle for Jewish Identity in Israelby Noah J. Efron, or even the fiction written by Naomi Regan."
2,"interesting, but hardly convincing","This is a very fascinating read about adolescent girls in the Lubavitch section of Crown Heights. However, the study is not rigorous enough to really support the theoretical claims the author tries to make. Surely her research into Orthodox Jews in general would have suggested that girls in the Lubavitch community are NOT representative of those in either mainstream Orthodox Jewish or ""ultra-orthodox"" Chassidic communities, in which gender segregated schools are also the norm. As such, it's not clear how she can assert so confidently that the relative immaturity and extrovertedness of the girls she observes comes from their lack of inter-gender contact. The failure to ""test"" for alternative hypotheses - say, for example, the goals of community leaders, or the dictates of Lubavitch philosophy (neither of which are thoroughly examined - makes this even more problematic."
3,"interesting, insightful and a little long","This book was really different. The introduction and the conclusion were really too long and drawn out, however, the stories of the girls Levine met with and talked to were captivating and insightful. The writing seemed to be twofold, a long, drawn out sociological blah blah, but a great, funny, quirky, interesting middle. Worth the read for anyone who wants to learn more about the Lubavitch culture, about frum teenage girls and who wants a light read."
4,Encyclopedia of submissions,"Make no mistake, this DVD set is jam packed with moves. More than you'll probably ever learn. Koulikov gives some decent instruction, but it's of the encyclopedic sort. If you already study Sambo, Judo, Jujitsu, Wrestling or MMA then this set is worthy as such. Instruction wise Vladislav is careful to break down each move for you and show it in different angles. How to enter and exit each submission while protecting your own position is covered as well.What really hurts this set is that the dvd's are not chaptered. You can't go directly to a particular submission to watch, and quickly replay it as you try to learn the move. It plays more like a VHS tape. There are other amateur DVD authoring/production issues as well and they have a home made quality about them. If you are buying this for the submissions, then these issues won't bother you as the video quality is pretty clear, and Koulikov gives an honest attempt at demonstrating each move fairly comprehensively."
5,Excellent Value & An Excellent Seller,"Brick-and-mortar stores charge exhorbinant prices for cabinet hardware. Purchasing these items at Amazon.com saved me 75% literally.The seller was amazing. I received my product, undamaged, in less than 1 week from my order date, though I was quoted up to 3 weeks.Kudos to the seller for excellent service, and kudos to Amazon for offering FAIR MARKET VALUE on items!!! You are miles ahead of brick and mortar!!"
2,Only If You Must,"This is a textbook to read only if required for a class, and even then you might suggest your instructor consider using another text. Very generalized, rather dry, and often unclear work, at times verging towards being obscure and confusing, which I assume is due to either poor technical editing, or a general inability on the part of the authors to express their knowledge in print. The chapter explaining the earth's revolution and rotation in particular seems unnecessarily vague and unhelpful, and the book in general is filled with facts with little supporting explication as to the whys and wherefores of the information being provided.If you are looking for a book that will help you to understand the principles of physical geography, this is not it. Must wonder whether my professor has recently even read this current edition. . ."
1,Natural pet cures: Dog and cat care the natural way,"I bought this book in good faith that it would help me with three rotty puppies I rescued.One got sick with parvo so I started the treatment on the hour with the formula described in this book. I even started the well puppies on the formula on the hour.My puppies are so sick at this point,4 days later that I am putting 2 down today because they are to weak to throw up.I wish I could sue.My heart is breaking."
1,Terrible Advice - I couldn't believe it!,"Like the writer from Memphis, I too bought this book in good faith. I had to re-read the author's comments on spaying and neutering a thousand times I was so dumbfounded. ""Spaying and neutering deprives a dog from the joys of parenthood""? Are you kidding me? It is absolutely that kind of thinking that leads to the millions of homeless animals that have to be euthanized. My advice to the author, spend a few weeks volunteering at a shelter (I have volunteered at one for 3 years) Witness shelters that are bursting at the seams because of his logic. Maybe then the author would realize that the ""joys of parenthood"" mean nothing when faced with the realities of euthanasia"
5,Excellent Source for Practical Info,This book contains a ton of practical information on pet care that can be accomplished by pet owners. Highly recommended for anyone who wants to care for their pets.
2,Natural Pet Cures,The book was supposed to be in good condition but the back cover was ripped I would appreciate it if they at least put a piece of tape on it before mailing. Not impressed with this company.
1,Waste of money,"I am a fledgling bagpiper, and bought this CD because it has a tune that I'm learning to play (King George V). The sound is not of the best quality, and the mix of several of the tunes with other band instruments is not what I wanted at all. If you're looking for a CD of pipes and drums, this isn't it."
5,Verrry interesting....,"I bought Song Cycles as an album, for God knows what reason, sometime in the 70's. The melodies and lyrics have never left me - even if I don't listen to it for years, I suddenly find myself humming or singing bits and pieces (""The crack of the bat on Vine Street..."" or ""What is up the Canyon must even eventually come down...""). In fact, I just recommended it to a young friend (a turntablist), and realized I had lost the album sometime in the last 2 or 3 years (probably lent it to someone else!). So I'm buying the CD.Eclectic, never dull, NOT easy listening, but a lot of fun."
4,Dig it!,"Have patience with his high, campy vocal, and fans of the Beach Boy's ""Smiley Smile"" and Randy Newman's debut album will fall in love with this swirly, prancy sound parade. I have a cute little dance I do every time I listen to ""The Attic"". It's overwhelmingly lush, takes many hairpin turns and changes color every five seconds - but don't let this put you off upon first listen. I guarantee it sounds like nothing else you'll ever hear and you won't want it any other way once you're hooked! My only complaint are the sometimes overly coy & clever lyrics, but I forgive him. Van Dyke rules!"
2,Redicuolous Music,"Van Dyke Parks was Brian Wilson's version of Yoko Ono i.e. a hanger on, no talent. This so called ""album"" proves it. Two stars only for the production quality."
5,A quick and relevant read,"I read Chasing Ghosts in a day...and I'm a girl.More than a story about the war, it's a look inside the shaping of the ""modern American male"" mixed with examining the societal and political issues affecting our generation as we come into an identity of our own. Rieckhoff's writing is lean, engaging, and, most importantly, honest as he takes us on his journey to find answers about the questions we're all asking. In a market saturated with ego - Chasing Ghosts is a refreshing example of what writing should be."
5,This Book Should Be Required Reading,"The things you learn in this book are disturbing but it is information everyone in America should know.It is interesting and it is a good book. Paul Rieckoff deserves a lot of praise for his willingness to take up the cause of Veterans. We all should follow his lead and make it a priority to support those who have had to fight in this war-- or any war for that matter. READ IT. You will be glad you did regardless of how you feel about Iraq. And if you don't care about the issues, then read it for entertainment. It is VERY entertaining."
4,A must read,"Paul Rieckhoff's Chasing Ghosts is a straight forward non-fictional account of his tour in Iraq. His thoughts, his men, his experiences. It's at times poignantly funny, yet heart stoppingly sobering. When he talks about the children of Iraq, his desire to do what he was sent there to do is palpable. Well written, affecting and inspiring."
5,"Thank you, Mr. Rieckhoff!!!!","This book tells it like it is from someone who was there!Having read many of Mr.Rieckhoff's articles, I couldn't waitto read this book. It is direct and honest. He is a brilliantwriter!I strongly urge people to purchase this book."
5,Like Being There,"Chasing Ghosts is in the great tradition of first person reportage. It takes you into Baghdad with clear eyes and an open heart. Rieckhoff cuts through all the spin and puts you in boots on the ground. You feel like you are an embedded reporter seeing the action first hand, things you will not get from Republicans, Democrats, or the news. Like all great writing, it makes you feel like you are there and not in the ""Green Zone,"" which is scary, funny, dramatic, and tragic. Chasing Ghosts accomplishes two seemingly opposing tasks. It makes you a patriot and it makes you question the war and the government from A to Z.Kurt Brungardt"
5,confirmation,"I read this book because I have a friend that was in Iraq. He was wounded and when he came home he suddenly became useless to theAmerican government. I suspected most of what I read and it was confirmed. I want to spread the word and I am trying to do that. The book made me cry and laugh and get angry and extremely frustrated. I would recommend this book to everyone. Read it and ""Wake Up"" Thanks for telling the truth Paul."
1,John Kerry All Over Again,"The first picture in the center of the book is a picture of Paul and Hillary Clinton. Gee, how many platoon leaders in the Florida Guard got to go get a White House photo with Hillary? This book is so biased and supports the claims of many of his troops that he was an attention hound in country. We call guys like this Spotlight Candidates in OCS. They only shine when the spotlight (The Brass / Media) comes around. Very biased and a clear display of political ambition. There is a reason a kid from New York (Democratic district) would transfer to Florida's Panhandle (Republican district) to join the war effort. He could have stayed home and gone with the New York Guard but then that wouldn't be much of a story would it?"
4,Dust (P_ssing) in the wind,"Too busy to keep up with our latest wars ?, especially the earlier part of the Iraq war , here is a good book to get you up to speed. It has a clear tone, fast pacing and is passionately sincere. Dealing with the topic of the book, most people still seem not to get the disposable part of war, and then of course there is the masters (tunnel vision) and ghouls (attack dogs) concept. Furthermore, this has nothing to do with walking in their shoes..., it's about belief systems, where we can evolve as in evolution or we're righteous like religion, but we can't just be ensalved by the all mighty dollar (Sucess feeds on motivation). To conclude, when our enemies see no weakness, only strength, there will be peace, history says civilizations come and ...., we are not aliens . Also read:The Gamble: General David Petraeus and the American Military Adventure in Iraq, 2006-2008."
2,Warning: See The Publisher's Weekly Review,"I saw the author on Hardball and was taken in. Seemed like a good guy. I bought the book; what a mistake. The writing is shoddy, the 'combat' he describes is more complaining than fighting, and he's so full of himself that his hint-dropping is tiresome. This isn't a memoir so much as a selfish rant. I'm an avid reader. I should have read the Publisher's Weekly review more closely. For someone who is impressive onscreen, it's clear now he just speaks in sound bites (or he can't write). The story has no pace and no intent except to say: Look at me. This is a churn-em-and-burn 'em platform. The characters aren't real people. They are props for the author. They ebb and flow around his big head. I was hoping for a much better read. Buyer beware."
2,More shallow negitivity,"Don't waste your time or money. If you recieve any one of the major news papers in the united states, then you have read everything in this book. This book has no sustance, no style and continued to read like DNC talking points right through to the end. I feel for Vets like Rieckhoff, whos only focus is on the bad in all we have done. Paul had many positive experiances while serving this country, but none have influanced his opinions one bit.Good luck Paul, may you find what you are searching for."
4,A definite must-read!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book! It truly opened my eyes to the ""real"" war that we are fighting in Iraq. We are so sheltered from the actual events, as the news media gives us such a small daily tidbit on the situation in Iraq. This book lets us know exactly what is going on, from an intelligent person who was actually there.This book should be a must-read for all Americans. We need to know what is going on!In addition, it opened my eyes to what I can do from home and what Paul is doing now to continue his fight."
5,Great Book a MUST READ,"Chasing Ghosts by Paul Rieckhoff is a gripping sitting on the edge of you seat type of book.Chasing Ghosts tells it like it is Iraq no punches pulled, nothing soften just the cold facts of what a Loyal American Army officer encountered in Iraq, from policing the bloody streets of Baghdad to the deserts of Iraq.Chasing Ghosts tells of how American blood and the blood of Iraq's satruate the air, the sand and the dest. It tells of not only fighting an enemy but also fighting the elements in Iraq.You come away from the books with humble of feeling of gratitude for our fighting troops and the American Veteran.You also come away with a sinking feeling when you realize that President Bush has gotten us into another Vietnam whose name is Iraq."
4,An Emotional and Patriotic Look at the Truth,"Personally I am not a big reader of books. However, with a brother in his 3rd tour in Iraq and growing up in a military family and having known Paul as a simple aquaintance in high school, I was excited to check out his book. Not many people from our high school make it into the public eye like Paul has. From the moment I picked up the book I was hooked. It is a powerful and inspiring account of a true and rare American patriot. A patriot who knows what his beliefs are and who is willing to put his life on the line to defend those beliefs. It stirred up a lot of emotions from laughter, tears, and in the end a belief that our soldiers are true heros. I would definately recommend this to anyone and do. Congratulations Paul and look forward to following your inspring career in the years ahead."
1,Useless,"I'm a regular player and was really looking forward to this. But I was even more disappointed when it arrived. Reads like the writer has never played, just a rehash of cliches. Save your money."
1,don't bother!!!!!!!,"I agree with the last poster! DO NOT.....I repeat, D o N O T waste your money on this book!! It's a complete waste of time and tells you absolutely nothing you shouldn't already know yourself! Reading tells is pretty self explanatory. It's just a matter of practicing so you read the subtle ones. 9 out of 10 people won't be playing with professional poker players anyways so what's the point. And even the pro's try as hard as they can to hide their tells by wearing glasses so you can't see their eyes, etc etc. All you have to do is watch the person and see if their mannerisms change or if their eyes get shifty or if they get over confident or their voice changes. It's basic knowledge.Whatever you do, don't waste your money. This guy wrote a book about nothing in order to take peoples money. Keep your money and practice. That's all it comes down too is ""PRACTICE""!:)He named this book correctly too. You're an idiot if you BUY this book!"
5,Martin is wonderful.,It is some of his most appealing work so fare. Martin should do more solo work like this.
4,Short but Sweet,My only problem with this CD is that it is too short. Anyone who is a Depeche Mode fan should buy this CD.
3,Depeche Rocks,"Hi. I've been a fan of DM since '98 and have never been disappointed. I listened to the clips of this album and thought ""I must have this"", so I ordered it. Martin Gore is unprecedented and brilliant, thought I'll admit - I much prefer the Basildon 3 as a group! Keep it coming."
4,Mart scores!,Martin Gore of Depeche Mode covers these tracks wonderfully. I love _Gone_ especially. A must for any Depeche fan!
5,How does he do it?!?!,"Martin Gore goes at it alone, and boy does he impress! Best words to describe this album are haunting and addictive. He does a much better job than the originals. 'Motherless Child' is simply amazing.Wished there were more than just the 6 songs. My pleasure is cut way too short."
3,A smile in the crowd,"The album is okay.I am surprised that nobody mentioned ""A smile in the crowd"". Martin Gore's version of this song from The Durutti Column is absolutely amazing!"
2,10 year old recording leaves much to be desired for DM fan.,"I am an absolute, undeniable Depech Mode fan and it was with great excitement that I bought Martin Gore's solo CD. After all, Martin wrote the lyrics to almost all of Depeche Mode's work. So his solo work, uncompromised from working with three other band members, must be incredible! Right? Well, it was not to be. I was shocked upon opening the CD to learn that NONE of the songs were written by Martin Gore! NONE! The music is fine although very shallow compared to what you'd expect from one of Depeche Mode's founding members. Very basic instrumentation with seemingly no creativity, especially when you consider this work was done between Depeche Mode's ""Music for the Masses"" and ""Violator."" If you're a DM collector you'll probably want this odd piece but I can't recommend owning a copy for the music (even with my love for Depeche Mode)."
2,My opinion,"I have been a fan of DM since the mid-80's and I am aware that Martin Gore wrote almost every song. So, like a lot of other people, I was unpleasantly surprised to see that Gore didn't write any of them. And how do people know this ep is a collection of covers? I certaintly didn't recognize any of the songs. And Gore doesn't even seem to give the original guys credit because they are not mentioned.As for the songs themselves... only 'Compulsion' comes across as a song that sounds anything at all like Depeche Mode. All the rest are too slow or too experimental. Of course, Gore's voice is always nice to listen to, but in these unfamiliar surroundings, that alone can't make up for the generally bad songs.Don't be misled by all of the other reviews written by die-hard DM fans - these people would NEVER actually say anything about our favorite synth-boys! The only reason I'm writing a review is because I'm looking forward to their new album coming out in May."
4,Everything depeche rules.,This Martin Gore solo abum rules. I love this album. I love all the remakes of course I'd never heard the originals but who cares. The song mother earth is my fav . The whole album is a deffinate must have for any depeche mode fan.
4,Sweet!,"This album is reminiscent of the music from Depeche Mode's Music for the Masses. If you like that album, then you will enjoy this album. This solo project by Depeche Mode member Martin Gore is like listening to a regular Depeche Mode album except Martin Gore is singing. This album can easily be added to the Depeche Mode collection considering that the songs performed by Martin are not his own. It is a short and sweet album to listen to for all you Depeche Mode fans out there and especially if you love Martin's beautiful vocals."
5,Ian does it.....,"The first IanHunter record since MottTheHoople.....with MickRonson .....this record lets Ian both rock & ballad in true 1975 style rock'n'roll.....both Ian & Mick play their heart's out.....complete with Ian's original 'OnceBittenTwiceShy' and Mick's burning guitar on 'TheTruth'.....truly a master-piece for any IanHunter fan.....c'mon, it's IanHunter & MickRonson together after the break-ups of their respective bands.....gotta get this now!"
1,Big disappointment,"I remember being a little sad when Mott the Hoople broke up but alas,an Ian Hunter solo album was on the way.I loved this album as a kid and played it many times.I have been looking for the cd for many years,hoping it would show up in a record store.It never did.Then i found Amazon.By now i have ordered quite a number of cds from Amazon and this is the first one that I've been truly disappointed with.The music is great. The sound is just ok.Nothing was done to enhance sound quality.Then there is the packaging. All you get with this Columbia Legacy cd is the cover,song list and nothing else.There is not one photo,production credit,musician credit,studio or even when it was recorded.Nothing! This cd was @13.00.It should have been $4.99."
4,"A good book, but with small flaws","This is a well written book, it explains what exactly is going on in politics about guns and terrorism and freedom. It especially focuses on how Sept. 11 has change our way of thinking. The author is very pro Second Amendment and for keeping all right including the right to bear arms.It explains how the media has twisted stories to make guns look deadly and bad. However, the author also tends to twist and leave out certain statistics to prove his point.It's a good book. Of course it is a persuasive book. But anyone should read it; it will open up your mind, no matter what side you're on about guns."
5,Epitaph to a Great Writer,"What a wonderful book! Reading it was like sitting with the author and talking about Ed Abbey over a couple of beers. Bishop's style is so smooth and relaxing. He could give a lesson to all current biographers: we don't need to know everytime the subject had tea with someone or tied his tie over the course of 800 pages! It was just the right mix of disscussion of his life and his books. The last chapter, ""Farewell..."" was very moving. Edward Abbey was a man I would have loved to have known personally because he was so interesting and caustic, and especially because I don't always agree with him, which makes an interesting mix. I have read 2 novels and 1 book of essays of Abbey's and look forward to reading everything else he has written. A real nice job by the author."
4,A Glaring Mistake,"The author states that Edward Abbey died of an incurable pancreatic disease. This is completely wrong. Edward Abbey died from esophageal varices (varicose veins of the esophagus), specifically from the hemorrhaging caused by them. However, Edward Abbey was initially diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, so perhaps that's where the author got his idea. Douglas Peacock, in his book ""Waling it Off"", about his friendship with Abbey, describes the condition and Abbey's death.But one glaring mistake - oh well. I loved Edward Abbey's writings; loved his passion, agreed with so much of his beliefs and his pro-wilderness stance, so I'm prepared to be forgiving of this book, since I like to read anything about Abbey."
4,Entirely hilarious,"An inspiration for Jonathan Swift, Other Worlds (which I first saw translated to English as Voyages to the Sun and to the Moon)has some parts that are still side-splittingly funny, as in the account of the Serpent's punishment for tempting Eve (it was condemned to lie coiled up inside Man, with only the head sticking out. And when the head rose up to bite Woman, the resultant swelling would last 9 months.) I have a feeling that much of the humor is more pointed than I can discern, unacquainted as I am with 17th century French politics.Much of it is still pertinent though, and it is interesting to read a work by the original of Rostand's hero."
5,Money well spent,"Shadows Of War is an early Loudness work (orig. released in 1986), that, while dated, remains timeless. If you are familiar with Loudness, you know what this band is capable of. If you are not, simply give it a listen to find out what all the hype is about. This album is a showcase of Akira Takasaki's amazing talents, as nearly every song is centered around his mind-blowing solos. As part of the Remastered Loudness 20th Anniversary, the quality is awesome, making this well sought after release even better. A perfect companion to the 1988 release Jealousy!"
4,Dehydrator,The person I gave this to loves this product. Works great and everything has tasted great too. Love that it comes with a Starter Kit for someone who might not know where to start.
1,Don't Expect to Make a COPY !!!!,"I paid the $2.99, got my download, everything worked nicely, BUT WHO WANTS TO WATCH A FOOTBALL GAME ON THEIR P.C. ??? SO, as I hoped, I tried to use Roxio Software to create a ""family friendly"" DVD of the game, TO NO AVAIL !!! FOXSPORTS PUT SOME KIND OF RESTRICTIONS ON THE ABILITY TO COPY THE GAME FROM MY PC TO A DVD.....THAT STINKS !!! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY !!!"
4,Spelljammer--Space Fantasy,"Compared to any of the other books situated in the Dungeons and Dragons universes, I have enjoyed the Spelljammer stories quite thoroughly. I recommend this book highly to anyone that likes Dragonlance, Forgotten Realms, Darksun, Greyhawk, or Planescape."
1,Kindle Edition,"Heart of Darkness is an excellent story - my rating and review is of the Kindle Version presently available - for $35.19! Potential buyers should be aware that this book is available in several other versions in the Kindle store for less than $1, or even free."
5,Beautiful music from LA's best,"This is a gorgeous CD with stellar performances by some of LA's best musicians...Alan Broadbent, Alan Pasqua, Nels Cline, Peter Erskine and many others. Von Essen was a marvelous composer, and he must truly have been loved and appreciated by his colleagues for them to make a CD like this."
4,Could've been Nirvana,"Before there was Seattle, there was Minneapolis and the bands such as Husker. They did not get the airplay that the grunge scene got unless you listened to the college stations, but there were both powerful and thoughful in the same breath. Songs like SHE'S A WOMAN AND NOW HE IS A MAN will tell you why."
4,Refined Husker Du,"This is the best set of songs created by Bob Mould and company. I am not really a Grant Hart fan, but he does pull off a couple of good songs on this album. Warehouse is a softer LP than their other landmark album Zen Arcade. If you want a real heart and soul Husker Du album listen to Candy Apple Grey."
5,The Huskers Last Stand,"The greatest band of the 80's last album hasn't got their magic 84-85's trilogy thrashy wall of sound but it's still chock full of angsty punk pop gems.""Ice Cold Ice"" is certainly one of Bob Mould's best compositions and is followed closely by ""Could you be the one?"" and ""Bed of Nails"".The album isn't totally flawless because of a couple of subpar Grant Hart songs but it would be petty to argue against an album that offers a wealth of over 15 amazing songs."
5,Prelude to the breakup,"Sure, it's a great album, I love it, but it also points to the fabric of the band pulling apart. Perhaps the Hüskers pushed too hard... this is just one of two double-album ""concepts"" released in a rather short time. Still, when I was in college in the 80s & ""120 Minutes"" was cool, this was GREAT music."
3,"This Ain't ""The White Album""","Don't be fooled....This is not raw Husker,this is polished big label Husker. However despite that fact there are some brilliant moments (Ice Cold Ice, It's Not Peculiar, Could you Be The One). Overall Moulds songs are better than Harts but there is plenty of filler from both(about 1/2 of the record), and on many songs the Group has lost their edge sounding a bit too friendly for my ears. Should've been a single Lp and it would have sounded more cohesive. Overall still worthy of your collection."
3,Disappointing Final Release,"That this record gets better listener reviews than Flip Your Wig drives me crazy. Yes, there are some very catchy pop tinged songs on this release that I really do like but this record as a whole totally lacks the intensity of the SST works. Am I just a bitter fan who wanted to keep the band small and non-corporate? -Maybe, okay almost certainly.- I do understand that bands evolve and their sound changes ( I feel your pain Metallica fans!) with each trip to the studio but this recording sounds totally phoned in and forced. No, it's not terrible but clearly is the work of a band well on there way to imploding. If you are a fan you should certainly have this in your Husker Du library but if you are not familiar with the band start at Zen Arcade and work your way to this one."
3,not the best but fair,"i got this game a week ago its good but not the best it needs more missions,more rardar modes,more wepons other than just 4,alotmore veiws,and take this game off the market it sucks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!"
3,Be advises this is a tank SIM,Realize before buying this is a tank simulation and tactic proficiency of engaging enemy tanks is paramount. If tactical tank warfare interests you check this out. Arcade enthusiasts look elsewhere.
2,disappointment,"First I must say that the camera took great pictures, while it lasted. The trouble is that the lens mechanism is much too fragile. We had our camera for about six months with no issues. Then one day the lens got stuck in the protracted position when I turned the camera off, and there was nothing I could do to get the camera working again. It just displayed the message ""lens error"". Batteries were not the problem. I even tried it with an ac adapter. Luckily I still had the receipt, so I sent the camera to Kodak and got it back in a few weeks working again. Kodak claims there was nothing wrong with it (yeah, right). Unfortunately, we also bought one of these cameras for my in-laws (back when we were still enjoying ours), but we lost that receipt. So when their lens jammed (within 3 months), we had no choice but to get a new camera. That's just a shame."
3,Good for the price - Take care of the service,"The product does what it's suposed to do, but nothing else. But that wy you are paying that price.My first unit came defective, that speaks bad about quality control after refurbish, but the seller acted really good, change was easy."
4,A nice little camera.,"Now, I have to include a disclaimer here: most of my previous digital cameras have been crappy 640x480 ones, like inside the Palm Zire 71 and those ""pen sized cams"" you see in toy aisles now for $14. I am used to mediocrity. :)I was on the hunt for another brand I saw on clearance someplace, and instead the manager showed me this particular model which at the time wasn't due to be on the shelf for another week. The price was the same, so I took a chance. I loved it! Took some time to read up on the proper usage, but once I figured things out I was very pleased. Nice crisp shots; bright flash. Having the ability to record video (320x200) directly to Quicktime .mov format is a nice bonus that I didn't think I'd use, but I found myself using it once or twice.My only gripe would have to be that you can't charge it via the USB connection. Instead, they have a dock that you charge it on (sold seperately for another $50), or you can do the battery recharge shuffle. :P"
3,my first digital...wish it would have lasted,I recieved this camera as a birthday present Oct. 2005. I loved it...great picture quilty for a 3mp! Crisp pictures...and easy to use..all until Dec of that same year. I turned the camera on and I heard a 'pop' noise and it zapped my batteries dead on the spot. My flash has never worked since then. The proplem with this was I had no receipt...no box..nothing (all my fault) so Kodak can't do anything without charging me a charge to fix it. I am still able to use it without the flash but not as good quailty for indoors..all my sample pics i posted are without flash.
2,Avoid It If You Can,"This comforter set is a big disappointment. It looks much better in photo than in real. The thread-count of the comforter is very low and it feels like rough plastic. The 180-thread-count kid's comforter I had feels a lot softer and smoother than this. Also, the King size comforter is SMALL. This list price is a joke. Do not recommend, not even for the guest bedroom."
2,Lot different to the Actual photographs shown on site,I was really impressed by looking at the pictures but when i recieved the product it was totally different. The material looks different and it was a used product.
1,You get what you pay for.,"I was excited to see a ""Jacquard"" bedspread at such an unbelievable price! I should have known better. Junk, junk junk! Never even took it out of the package. Yuck! I'm thinking of using it as a dog comforter....but it will probably be to itchy for them."
4,Good product for the price,Definitely yes. Arrived on time. Cant really ask for more for less than $30.
1,Chinese hater's delight,"Don't really find any insight about the Chinese people as a whole. Jasper simply observed and added his own prejudice to it.For example, ""When I spoke to the peasants of Zizhou, the villagers had just returned from a performance by a travelling opera troupe who had set up a temporary stage on the only patch of flat ground in the narrow valley. As we talked we could hear the high-pitched voices and the clash of cymbals as the troupe played out another tale... The ritualized performance, and the peasants' delight in it, spoke of history's powerful and oftern merciless grip on the minds of so many in China.""Sounds like he think only Europeans are capable of enjoying the music and the artistry of an opera performance. Chinese people enjoying Chinese opera proves ""[Chinese] history's powerful and often merciless grip on the minds of so many in China."" What kind of analysis/insight is this?"
5,Mandatory Reading,"My work concerns the economic impact of legal infrastructures. I have written about legal systems in various countries including Thailand, Japan, Korea, Brazil and Taiwan. Most recently I've been working on legal infrastructure in China. My articles have been published in Foreign Affairs and ChinaOnline.I have read and reread and Jasper Becker's book ""The Chinese"". It is truly one of the most informative books that I have ever read. It should be mandatory reading for any world leader. In addition, it should be required reading for anyone who is even remotely interested in investing in China.Mr. Becker exposes the fraud and myth of China with beautiful language and a plethora of facts. His portrait of China is unassailable to anyone who has taken the trouble to dig beneath the 1.2 billion person market fiction. It is impossible to even think about China without reference to this book. Simply fascinating"
5,Quirky... did I get the joke?,"I bought this CD based on a few different influences. I have become a fan of Sam Witwer as an actor in recent years. I was intrigued that he was a musician, and when I realized that he plays the rolls of all the band members it piqued my curiosity. With further research, I found that this album was rather sought-after (no used copies available and only a few new). I figured this ""band"" had a bit of a cult following. I listened to the samples of each track and I thought I'd like it. Once I got it in my hot little hands I realized that I did in fact enjoy the music. The only thing that bothers me is that he uses some pretty bad language. I don't really like that, but I'm a grown-up and I can handle it. Truth be told, he really only uses one ""bad word""... The problem is that he uses it a lot, and often puts the word ""mother"" in front of it. So be it.All-in-all, I'm glad I have it and I really have been listening to it repeatedly."
1,Don't buy these rails.,"The rails are solid, but they're drilled both for a normal installation at an even 1U boundary and also for nonstandard use at a half-U. Unfortunately, the 1U drilling is right at the bend in the ""L"" (the half-U drilling is in a more sensible spot), and placing any weight at all on the rail applies enough force that the rail torques down into the next lower U, preventing any normal-height equipment from installing there.It looks like the original design of the product included washers for the bolts that might reduce this twisting, but the washers that currently ship with the product are too small to fit the bolt and hence are useless."
3,"Save your money, buy a picture book","I was very disappointed in this video, out of 50 minutes of tape I doubt that even 10 were of the subject. Like most of those tapes about his mother Prince William: Behind the Headlines consists mostly of a bunch of people talking about him with a few small scraps of video thrown in( I will admit I hadn't seen most of that before). These experts annoy me with their opinions about what's best for him as if they really know what is going on in William's private life. If you're interested in the boy go to Amazon's book section and type Prince William in the search box, you'll find better material. The Boy who would be King by Nigel Blundell is one example of what they've got there."
2,About Drugs,"It was a very interseting video, but basically nothing was about William, it was all on other people like his friends or other royals that do drugs. It's good for like an anti-drug lesson."
4,Pretty Wild,"I'm a huge fan of film music, and these suites were recommended to me. I am pleasantly suprised. Mars-The bringer of War is really cool, as is everything (Venus- The bringer of peace is slow) But all in all it's really nifty to listen (now I know what influences a lot of my favorite composers."
3,Big Trash it is not.,"This is not one of my favorite Thomspon Twin albums- but I must say there is no such thing as a bad Thompson Twins album. This album is less new wave, less pop and more rock - yet with the definate TT sound. I think the best songs are the catchy Sugar Daddy, Bombers In The Sky, This Girl Is On Fire and my favorite Dirty Summer's Day. Dirty Summer's Day should have been a single- lots of remix potential. I only hope that the Thompson Twins or Babble or whatever they want to call themselves continue to make great music."
5,"1,2,3 review","This is a very special book for me, not only because of the wonderful children and pictures, but one of my students is on the cover and in other pictures throughout the book. Now everyone can share in the joy of seeing his beautiful smiling face. Behind that beautiful face is a wonderful, kind, and caring young boy who can lift your spirits with his jokes and loving hugs. I think it is wonderful that Meg Girnis protrays children who have Down's Syndrome in her books. I hope she continues to write more children's books."
4,Big and fluffy,"The petticoat is as described and it is actually fluffier/fuller than the ones from David's Bridal. I also bought like 4 different other petticoats to compare (returned them) but none of them is fuller than this one. The only problem I have is that the petticoat itself is not strong enough to hold my heavy wedding dress in shape when I walk. There is no way to make the crinoline stiff enough even after I sent it to the cleaners to get it steamed (waste of money). I ended up having to walk and kick the dress at the same time to prevent from tripping because the petticoat couldn't hold the shape of my dress. It's a little awkward but it works. Advice: Make sure that your dress is not too heavy and if the petticoat do not work for you the first time, then it won't. Don't waste money taking it to the cleaners."
1,not pleased,"The lable stated that the package came damaged. Also, the slip was too big, gaudy and does not flow as the picture describes."
3,not what i had expected,i had bought this to go under a dress but when i pulled it out of the box it was very bunched and though the company tells you to hang it up so that the crinoline will fall smoothly down it was still bunched. upon flipping the garment over it just seems to be too much netting that it can't lay smooth. i was very disappointed in the product but not with the company. it does not tend to lay and give you the a-line look at all.
4,Just to be clear,"This is a drawstring petticoat. That is a piece of info I was looking for when shopping, so I thought I would share. It will work well for my A-line dress.Arrived timely and in good condition."
4,Great purchase!,"This petticoat filled out my heavy wedding dress nicely and would certainly fit a waist greater than 34 inches since it's on a drawstring. Works wonderfully, especially for the price! And it's made in the USA to boot ;)"
2,Totally uneven,"I tried everything with this petticoat before returning it, but it's just...bunchy. It was certainly poofy, but would not give me the a line shape I desired, and some areas were much more full than others because one of the bottom layers of tulle is very voluminous, and likes to stick to itself. I'm going to keep looking."
5,Fabulous Product!!! Lifesaver for a budgeted bride!!!,"This product was absolutely fabulous! After searching high and low in bridal stores, you get tired of getting the same sky high price for a simple undergarment thats needed just to fluff up your already expensive wedding gown! Most places will charge $80 - $120 for this, while this VERY reasonable price of $40 was a life saver! True to description, it will fit all sizes, I am a size 5 and it snugged right to my waist, I was also able to fluff it out of the box, take a little steam to it and voila! It stayed nice and plush for a month before the wedding, I simply hung above my closet and it was ready to go. Would highly recommend for any brides desperately seeking undergarments for an A-line or Princess style wedding gown, its a great product and great price!!! Thanks a million!!!"
5,Wonderful product!,This item is absolutely perfect with my ballroom style wedding dress. It is exactly the way it appears in the photo and provides the fullness needed for my dress. The bridal stores wanted $60-$80 for a similar undergarment and was not as nice as this one. I like the draw string and it is very comfortable. This is a well made item and if you steam or fluff it out (do not iron) it will work well for you as well. This was the last item needed to complete my wedding day attire and I was so excited when I tried it on...I knew my that my bridal shopping was completed.
5,Board game arrived in advertised condition,"Bought a fancy board game which arrived in the correct condition of new. Fun game if you like the strategy/chance games similar to Catan, Carcassonne or Alhambra."
5,Great New Resource - Highly Recommend!!,"If you are searching for a way to rejuvenate your congregation into becoming a more ""encouraging"" ministry, or simply want your members to discover the ways in which they can be united, then Moots' ""Becoming Barnabas"" will be both a treasure and a resource. Moots uniquely uses Barnabas ""The Encourager"" as a model for Christians today. Moots does an outstanding job of blending practical stories (some that every churchgoer will recognize) with scriptural references. Particularly for smaller congregations, and focused toward congregational leaders (though everyone can benefit), ""Becoming Barnabas"" is a refreshing look at the church today and a promising glimpse of what it can be in the future."
5,Great Erotic Movie!,"I started watching this movie by accident on IFC channel and OMG I was shocked and appalled by what I was watching and then again.. I couldn't stop. I watched it to entirety, just fascinated by the storyline and plot, a student trying to get by! I ended up buying this movie because it's one of those movies you could watch over again, unlike some. Would recommend"
4,honest and competant,")The only criticism is that it was too long. 1 hour 48 mins could have lost 20-30 mine. Otherwise a competant and honest film that became increasingly disturbing more so because she never becomes hardened so I lost empathy. The sad fact was that as she became"" more professional ""so the range of how revolting and demanding the men were increased with the amount she took on. The main problem for a teenager is that older men's body really are well...... old (and ugly) let alone weird in practise.I never could phathom how a prostitute doesn't gag or how ugly and ridulous the male organ is when it comes in all shapes and sizes. People forget how distressing and revolting it is for girls and women pressed into prostitution and how prevalent. That the film is based on a fact is what held my sympathy and attention throughout otherwise not so sure it would have.The acting was enough for the veihchele of the film yet how complex does it have to be for Johns or a teen?"
1,Hayward Pool Cleaners,"Heard they are getting out of the cleaner business. Good. Their products are terrible.Design and quality are poor. My system just went out of warranty. I'm sure the decent deal that I got when the pool got built will be recouped when I have to buy replacement parts at obscene prices. Not impressed with Hayward. Have had 7 on site warranty calls since the pool was installed. Filters $135 each, need 4, lasts 3 years or so. Same with Salt Cell. Before you invest look at the lifecycle of the investment. BTW - I love my pool when it works well."
1,Works well sometimes,I have had my Phantom for 2.5 years and have had it in for service 6 times to have the insides redone because it stopped working correctly. When it works correctly it does a good job but most of the time its broke. I have had 6 new baffle sets installed over the 2.5 years and now the thing is falling apart. I have been lucky so far that is has all been warranty work but I only have about 3 months left of the warranty. I have also had to replace the bag one time and it's about ready for another. The shell is not of high quality and is already starting it chip. I have a liner pool which was damaged by the phantom and I had to have 3 leaks fixed after one of the wheels fell off. I will replace it with a Polaris when it breaks again this summer after the warrant expires.
1,Don't buy it.,"The Phantom is overpriced and really poorly designed. We just had ours replaced after basically every part of it (hose, housing, wheels, jets) had broken - our pool expert (NOT a Leslie's employee pushing the Phantom) confirmed that the issues we had occur widely among his other customers and shared some other horror stories.We also had similar problems to Franklin (see other Phantom review), where the Phantom would get twisted up and generally stuck in anything even closely resembling a corner...We ended up switching to the Polaris 380 instead. We had a Polaris model at our last house and were really happy with it, based on initial results I'm very happy with our decision."
4,Works better then ever,"i think this cleaner is perfect for my needs. I gave it 4 stars, only because the first 2 i had, ended up not working correctly due to a manufacturing error. The one I am using now is perfect. Comes to the top and scoops up the leaves, then to the bottom to get those that floated down to the bottom. This is the 3rd type of cleaner I have had over the years, and so far the best."
2,Great machine for one season only,"I purchased the Phantom 4 years ago. Works great for one season and then trouble begins. I have replaced the manifold twice, gear box 3 times, and as of today, I am faced with another gear box replacement. If you buy this product, expect to have trouble after a year of operation. You will buy replacement parts regardless of how well you care for the machine. I have written emails to the President of Hayward expressing my dissatisfaction. No response."
1,POS- You know what I mean,If you have already bought it and like it then you have exactly one year to be happy. Many of you have touched on it and here it is. The one thing that kills this otherwise good product is the Plastic Housings. Not that plastic is bad but if you don't follow the Plastics Design Rules (Hayward Did Not) then stuff starts breaking. Mine is done after only one year. It does pirouettes in the bottom of the pool until it tangles itself in the hose completely. The Nose Wheel and 2 Side Wheels have broken off from the housings. My pool store told me it is $300 to replace all the crap that is broken in mine. DO NOT BUY THIS UNIT.I put this same information on the customer feedback page of Hayward. I think they know but unfortunately it is too late. The unfortunate thing is that they don't even need new tooling for the plastics. They can fix what they have.DJ...
2,Poor performance,"Hayward could give these away and still make money on the replacement parts.Not durable or well designed, the tails are especially short lasting.I gave it two stars because the cleaning bag works well and when it is working it performing reasonably.."
4,SMALL & IT WORKS WELL,"I have had this product for about a year and it works just like I had hoped it would. These are handy for turning off appliances when they are not in use. I like this particular plug, because it is as small as I can imagine it can be, so it doesn't block the other outlet/receptacle it is paired with and it doesn't look unsightly."
4,"ok quality, a little loose in socket","I bought two of these, for switching on dimmer floor lamps on which the dimmer circuit had been fried.Quality is good, except that one of the two wiggles a little out of the wall socket with each press, and has to be pushed back in occasionally. I'm wondering whether the 3-prong one from a different manufacturer that's also available on Amazon would stay in socket better.Initially noticed that the tactile and audible feedback is different in the off direction than in the on direction -- one direction has a satisfying snap that you've pushed the switch all the way, but the other direction has less of that feedback -- but that hasn't bothered me.Cosmetically, although they protrude a lot, the white ones look modern enough, even though they protrude significantly and are noticeable on the wall. One of the spots, a black one would blend in better, but they only have white and an off-white."
4,Leviton Plug-in Switch,These switches come in handy when you have something like a table lamp with a switch that is going bad. As long as you can get the lamp or appliance into the 'on' position then you can use one of these to control the power before the real switch goes completely bad.
3,"This is transfer of TV recordings to DVD, not a new transfer from film to DVD.",The viewing quality of this DVD is the same excelent VHS; with interlacing lines is visible during movement. Very anoying to be seeing interlacing edges in video's with substancial movement. Interlacing is an artifact of NTSC TV which is something that could be eliminated by producing a new recording of the SOUNDIES.After watching a disappointingly talked over collection of SOUNDIES produced on DVD by PBS. I've got to say the the PBS guys did a great job with the video quality as their talked over SOUNDIES were the sharpest I've seen and recorded with no interlacing artifact. PBS must have produced new recording; wish those new recordings were available for viewing.
3,Love Ellington,Nice combo pak esp. if into nostalgic Afrocentric cinema. Not the best cinematography or acting and in some cases plot lines---but a very good buy and bargain and some great old flicks
3,Jazz 10 Movie Pack,This set contains the following:1. Check and Double Check2. Hi-De-Ho3. Killer Diller4. Paradise in Harlem5. Petite and Gone6. Rhythm and Blues Revue and Reet7. Rock 'N Roll Revue8. The Duke Is Tops9. Soundies Festival10. Soundies CavalcadePRODUCTION AND TECHNICAL NOTES:Aspect Ratio: Pre-1954 Standard (1.33.1)Presentation: B&W;Sound: Dolby Digital StereoLanguage: EnglishTime: 10 Hours 39 Minutes
2,disappointing,"I have been a fan of Steve F. for almost 25 years, and I am at a loss to understand the other two reviews raving about this CD-- I sold mine back. While Forbert is Forbert and is never awful, this is certainly NOT his best; missing the fine tuning and details of studio albums, and some weak selectionsPass and go on to other things."
4,Fun,"From what I gather from the jacket information and this page, this album was recorded in front of a very small crowd - but the setting only seemed to turn up Steve and the band to put a lot of energy and creativity into their performances. The production values are horrible. It sounds like it was recorded on a handheld dictaphone in a pillow - but the music is great. As you can see from the 'set list' - there are a lot of covers here, but the covers seem to have been put out with more gusto than the original works. My favorites are ""His Was The Sound"" (a Valens tribute) and ""Sweet Pea"" (a redemption of an otherwise silly little pop song). This might be a must for the Forbert fan; beginners would be better off with the ""Be Here Now"" live album."
1,"Don't buy this, it has an horrible BUG!","It's not trivial to get over the bug, it's frustrating and ruins the whole experience!DO NOT BUY this, I repeat!I've played the original Dragon's Lair Blu-ray lots of times and I'm very happy with the quality, but DL II: Time Warp Blu-ray is a complete waste of money.I seriously can't believe how something so badly tested can get out to the market like this!I wish Digital Leisure would replace my copy with a working one, because this is ridiculous!"
4,Legenda Aurea,"This is a great example of early music. I believe it is 14th century, around the time of Luther, Calvin, Cortez and Colombus. The instruments are period type, with recorders and simple drums. For all of the wanna-be Rennaisance fair types, this is your sound track. There is an early dance flavor to the music, and you may find yourself pacing around a room to the chants and beat. One of the better examples of this period of music."
3,Billy Jealousy Cashmere Coat is an ok choice.,Billy Jealousy Cashmere Coat has a nice peppermint smell and leaves your head tingling after use. The quantity needed for daily use seems a little high and the price is a bit more than I personally care to pay for a quality conditioner.
1,Horrible Conditioner,"It might be the worst conditioner I have ever used. It leaves my hair dry and a tangled mess. On the bottle it claims to prevent split-ends, detangle and add shine, but it has failed to do all 3. I figured for $22 a bottle it would be a safe product to try."
5,Wakes up your head,I had read about this in Men's Health Magazine and decided to give it a try. I like its cool tingling sensation and the way helps thicken up my my hair.
5,Perfect finishing product,"This stuff is great, especially when used with their shampoo. It does leave you hair soft and shiney without an oily residue. The scent is light and minty and hey, who doesn't want to feel like cashmere?"
3,If you can't afford the complete Montreux set ...,"While this is a great document of Miles' absolutely smokin' late-career bands -- right up there withThe Complete Miles Davis at Montreux: 1973-1991-- and much better than the lameLive Around the World--- be aware that the recording quality of Munich Concert is not much better than a bootleg. Very dissapointing. I will stick with my Montreux set; but for the price, this 3-CD concert can't be beat."
2,dissapointing recording,Good performance but terible audio quality makes this CD hard to sit through.
3,i liked this series when younger.,with the purchase i was thirlled but the contents are little bit arey i have no booklet. but slip is missing too. yet i'm overall extatic that its in good condition.
1,I love Saved by the Bell But...,"I love Saved By the Bell but I hate the fact the episodes are not as they chronologically aired. PLUS the episodes are cut! If you have any of the old Goodtimes released VHS tapes - you will see what I mean. So it's a great show with a very bad dvd release, I guess that is why it stays so cheap."
4,I have been waiting a while for this !,"I love this show in a major way! I am a homosexual and there is a large following of us who love this show becuase of one Dustin Diamond. He is our official sex symbol and this DVD will show you why. He is multi-talented with his acting, comedy, music and love of glass bottom boats. Zack and Slater have never looked hotter and Mr. Belding - the father I wished I could have had. I ecourage all my gay friends to purchase this set - and straight people will love this just as much. I can't wait for seasons 5 and 6 - I love you Dustin - keep being you!"
4,my favorite TV sitcom from childhood!,"I bought this Saved BY THE Bell dvd set a few months ago for 38 dollars and I have mixed feelings. I was very happy because they have some of the best shows in the entire series (like Fatal Distraction, Save that Tiger and 1-900 crushed). However, this is a bare-boned dvd with absolutely nothing to offer except the show. THEIR ARE NOT EVEN CHAPTER SELECTIONS! If they make dvds for the third and fourth seasons, which have great episodes like Cut Day, Aftermath, and FAKE I.D's among many others, then they should give the customer their money's worth because most of these actors could have done interviews or commentary to make this dvd set more interesting. This set is strictly for Die-hard fans of the show like me."
4,Good show,I had forgotten about this series. It wasn't one I watched all the time when it was popular but it's a good show.
5,Saved By The Bell Seasons 1 and 2,"Saved By The Bell Seasons 1 and 2 is such a fun show to watch on DVD,it's a 5 Disc Set which contains Seasons 1 and 2 together in a boxed set DVD.It's got fun episodes on 5 DVDs,Dancing To The Max,The Lisa Card,Screech's Woman,The Gift,Fatal Distraction,Cream For A Day,Pinned to The Mat,The Friendship Business and alot of other great episodes to watch over and over anytime you want.This is a really good show and I highly recommend it for anyone who likes Saved By The Bell,it's a great show and you can buy it anywhere you buy DVDs.This is a great show to watch over and over like a hundred times not just once or twice because this show is really good and awesome.I give it a 5 out of 5 stars and this is a very good show to watch for all ages,this is a really good TV show."
2,Just Okay.,"I love Saved by the Bell, and had recently just got into the show, so I ordered the first two seasons to catch up. As soon as I got it I put it in my laptop to watch, and the quality was terrible. Every few minutes the screen would twitch and it gave me a headache trying to watch it. I'm not sure if all of the first few seasons DVDs are like this or it's just a glitch on the one I received. I personally love the show, but from now on i'll just be continuing to watch it when it comes on TV."
5,saved by the bell,i loved saved by the bell the show is funny and cool also saved by the bell airs on the-n at either 6pm or 7pm two epsoides a night channel 124 if you have io cable slater screech kelly and zack are my favorties jessie and lisa are cool two but not as funny as the other 4 my favortie eposides are the the fight gradation jessie's song screech's bday and more
5,Awsome,"Unbelieveable! 5 dvds of your favorite episodes. My friends and I watched 2 discs (3 hours) when I first got it. Then watched the other 3 the next day. Watching slater dance is a highlight.Unfortunatly, the Rod Belding episode is missing. I recommend playing the SBTB drinking game while you watch. Just drink when Slater has no sleeves, Slater calls Zach preppy, Screech does something stupid, or you see someone with pants hiked uped to there chest."
2,Who made this thing?,"I love Save by the Bell but why are the shows out of order. One of the main reasons I bought these DVDs were to see the real order of the shows. However, the shows aren't even in order. When Slater moves to Bayside is on the third disk. What's up with that? Also, the box tears when you remove the seal. This was very poorly done. Saved by the bell is a great show, but these DVDs are not."
1,DVD Did Not Work,The Saved by the Bell Season 1 and 2 DVD did not work. The DVD was put in and did not go past the 7 second mark and had a great big line downturn right side of the screen. It isn't worth it for me to return it because it costs just as much to return it as it did for me to buy it in the first place due to shipping. It is frustrating because now I have Seasons 3-5 but Seasons 1-2 don't work. I guess I am just out what I paid for them and need to buy them again unless new ones are sent. I'm eager to see if anything actually happens because of this poor experience.
4,not season 1,they are all good that's why i bought it but this isn't season one They don't show when they were in jr. High and isn't in order they show slater's introduction until the middle of the season disc expecting season one to be when zack screech and lisa the only original cast of saved by the bell were in jr. high. when they were in jr high saved by the bell was originally more about a teacher named miss bliss and eventually the star power that is zack morris (mark paul gosselar) took over as main character I could see why it would be called saved by the bell if they focused on a teacher which isn't a bad idea was good for the steve harvey show...
3,i love this show,"why is the 1st episode on disk 3?that brings me 2 my next comment, are the other episodes in order? ???im confused???somebody please shed some light on the subject!"
2,TBS is Better,"I rather watch the re-runs on TBS rather than on this Dvd set I purchased. I expected some extras- behind the scenes-interviews- and where are they now? I know that some of the former cast memebers can give up a day to talk about their experience or something. Mario Lopez lives in the same neigborhood as my aunt...and I always see him when I go over to my aunt's place I will tell him how bad the Dvd Set, and that whoever put this Dvd set together did a Horrible job. Your better off watching it on TBS."
3,Where is the first season?,"I am a fan of S.B.T.B.and from what everyoneis saying that the actual first season isnot on season 1 and 2.We all know that thefirst seaon is with Miss Bliss,so where isit?They screwed up big time by puttingall the episodes out of order when allother t.v.shows are in order.I'm justwaiting for them to put the real firstseason on DVD.I also hope that eachseason is complete.I am getting season's3 and 4 for xmas but I don't have season1 and 2 yet.But hopefully each season is complete."
5,Seasons 3 & 4!!!,"Seasons 3 & 4 will be released on April 27, 2004! I can't wait!! :-)*Just a side note that I'm adding: These DVDs are edited!! I was watching an old VHS tape with the episode ""The Mamas and the Papas"" and there was a scene at the very beginning of the episode that was cut from the DVDs! Why are we spending money if they are not going include everything?! I love SBTB, but these DVDs don't do the show justice. Does anyone else know of any other scenes that have been edited?"
3,Episodes and Set Okay..Technical Aspects A Miss,"This DVD irritates me. I am a TV on DVD fan and this is the only DVD I have ever purchased that requires you to watch the entire opening credits. If you hit skip it takes you entirely to the next episode and not to the beginning of the show. Not to mention there is no booklet but a slot for one. They do have the episode names and air dates within the packaging. I'm a pop culture collector and hey you have to get this set not just because it's Saved By The Bell but you have to have the Jessie's Song episode on DVD. It's on disc 5. The price is good for 5 discs, but no extras..which I can live with. Great set for a fan."
4,A Gen X comfort product,"Ah Saved By the Bell.I was in grades 9-12 when Saved by the Bell originally aired so I can say I grew up with the show.I remembered it as being funny and enjoyable.I have received the DVD for X-mas from a friend who knew I was a fan.I'm amazed at how mature and clever much of the writing and jokes were for a teen show.Its alot better than I remembered and I appreciate it more now. I agree that the show is a perfect representation of young people (Gen X) in the late 80's-early 90's. From Zachs big clunky cell phone to freindship bracelets to references to George Bush (the daddy) and Gorbechev -I dare any Gen X'er to watch this DVD and not be transported down memory lane.It was a fun trip and for that I will overlook the flaws like no extras,no booklet and security tape that will rip the package if your not careful-4 out of 5-Keep them coming and improve with the next 1!-Michael E Johnson"
3,There are no screw-ups in this package!,"The episodes are by air date...NOT production date! Also, some people are saying there are missing episodes, but there were some episodes held over and first aired during seasons 3 & 4, so technically they didn't screw anything up.However, I still gave the set only 3 stars simply because of the cheap packaging and lack of extras.That's all."
5,I love Saved By the Bell!,"I grew up with this show. I always wanted to be part of ""the group,"" and watching seasons 1 & 2 on DVD made me re-live the moments that I spent watching this show as a kid. The show is in order, though it does not start with the original first few episodes with the characters: Miss Bliss, Mikey, and Nikki. What ever happened to those episodes? I dunno. Oh well. I highly recommend this."
5,"Great show, but DVD lacking and missing some episodes","I LOVE Saved By the Bell, and I'm VERY glad to finally have it on DVD, but where's the rest of Season 2? I KNOW there were more episodes in that season than were on this DVD. Also, this was quite a bare-bones collection. The video is barely average, the sound quality is nothing to write home about, and there are NO SPECIAL FEATURES (couldn't they have at least included the E! True Hollywood Story?). Still, because the show is so completely awesome (not to mention nostalgic), I give this package 5 stars.My only hope is that Lion's Gate and NBC will go all the way with this and release not only the rest of season 2 and seasons 3-4 (including the Malibu Sands and Tori episodes), but also the ""Good Morning Miss Bliss"" (8th grade) and College Years episodes, Hawaiian Style, and Wedding in Las Vegas. I'd pay a pretty penny for each of these. DON'T LET ME DOWN LION'S GATE!! I WANT THEM ALL!"
5,Classic Sitcom!,"Like many other kids from the 80's-90's I grew up on this show! I remember way back arguing with friends on who was cuter, Zack or Slater even haha! I couldn't be happier with purchasing this series and being able to live through the laughs and tears of the gang at Bayside High!"
4,"Awesome DVD, LOVED IT WITH ALL MY HEART, missing some stuff!","Heres the thing. DVD is awesome. Watched all the episodes in 2 nights. Very touching, etc... One thing dissapointing... Is, 1, the extra features, and 2 they didn't put all of season 2. Now, season 1 and half way threw 2 was GOOD, but the end of 2 and all of 3-5 was THE BEST. Thought I was buying that... But still, very cool DVD... MGGBRAVES, wanted to chat with you on something... Email me ASAP at yoyoyo777@aol.comThanks everyone!!"
4,FINALL:Y!!!!,"I have been watching Saved by the Bell for years now and am so glad it's out on DVD! I hated getting up early to watch it on TBS and now don't have to.WHoever said the episodes weren't in order never really watched the show! they aren't in order to you because when SLater moved to Bayside it was the beginning of Season 2! If you watched it as much as I did you would know that season 1 wasn't really Saved by the Bell, it was Wake up Miss Bliss with only Zach, Lisa, Screech and Mr Belding and when that show failed, NBC took those characters and put them in a new show called....... SAVED BY THE BELL! When they started showing reruns, they just made Wake up Miss Bliss part of Saved by the Bell."
1,If I could give it -5 stars I would!!,"Really terrible book. Just refer to all the other reviews, no need to reiterate!!!"
1,Do not buy this book,"When I sat down to read this book, I had to FORCE myself to finish it so I can honestly say this book SUCKS.It was slow and confusing."
1,Worst book I have read...,"This book gets the honor of being the worst book I have ever read. I read a LOT and can not believe that a book like this got published.The author writes about falling down the rabbit hole from Alice in Wonderland. I think you have to be chasing the white rabbit to understand the book. It is chaotic with no depth in any of the characters. The story is nonexistent. I can't believe that the author referred to Jesus as the Evil One, my, my, my. If you are even a little religious I think this book will offend you. It certainly did me.I wish I would have read the reviews before picking up this book. Please save your money or better yet get a book by a really good author like Kenyon, Feehan, Hamilton, Harris, etc."
2,Ridiculous,"This novel is absolutely ridiculous. The characters are extremely hard to relate to -- who are these atrocious people, and why should I give a crap what happens to them? None of them have redeeming qualities.As for the writing itself, the author's style is bizarre. A kinder way to put it would be 'unique,' I guess. It doesn't seem to be edited very well, either, especially pertaining to punctuation.The story isn't very compelling, and it meanders without purpose for quite awhile. I haven't been so thoroughly disgusted with a novel in a long, long time. And I would have put it down, but once I begin a book I read it to the (in this case bitter) end."
2,MIDNIGHT WORK,"The description of the book sounded great, but the actual story was kind of sucky. Like a previous reviewer stated, it jumped around alot and I had a hard time following the story.I hated that Sophie and Norah killed whoever whenever. And Olivier just accepted this. He changed Sophie when she died and was supposed to be her teacher, but he let her run off as soon as she woke up. She killed an innocent man on her way home and then proceeded to change her friend. And how was her friend changed, you ask? Well the heroine basically went up to her and asked: ""Do you want to be a vampire?"" Norah's answer: ""Sure."" You have GOT to be kidding me.The whole thing seemed rushed, like the author had to get from point a to b in a certain number of pages and forget everything else. I don't normally write a review, but this book aggravated me enough that I HAD to.Back cover description is definitely misleading."
2,where's the plot???,I cannot even finish this book. It is soooo boring. All I have read in the first 129 pages is mostly crap that seems to be repeating itself about the past. The excerpt on the back of this book sounded sooo promising. If the story line would move along and we could get less detailed paragraphs of who's friends with who and the why's of every little thing it probably wouldn't be too bad. I keep skipping paragraphs and sentences because they are boring and make no sense. For goodness sakes just tell a story and watch the typos!!!
2,The Midnight Work,I am an avid reader who enjoys a good vampire romance. This wasn't it! The book is disjointed and needed editing. Ms. Sims will need to hone her skills if she want's to have a returning audience. She also needs to find a publishing house whose editors take their jobs seriously. It was very disappointing.
2,More Horror Than Hugs,This book definitely should not be in the romance section. It would be more appropriate in the horror or maybe fantasy section. The characters are totally unsympathetic and although I tried to find some redeeming qualities in the main characters there really weren't any. If they weren't sociopaths themselves they helped to enable the other sociopaths. I picked up this book because the premise looked exciting and fun. It was anything but. The random killings and the blood and guts were more prominent than the romance. In fact if she remove about 10 pages any semblence of romance would be gone.
1,This book is so poorly written!,"I really hate to say that, I know how hard it must be to write and publish a book. But this was so hard to read, I had to make my self finish it just to see if it got better. The story jumps all over the place, I would have to go back and read over something because I thought I had missed something.The people are just so uninteresting, they don't have the spark to catch your attenction.They story line was all most like 3 or 4 outlines that she try to make into one book.Well they say pratice makes perfect. Mabe her next book will be better."
2,Not a romance,"If you like a book about amoral sociopaths, then this is the book for you. Otherwise don't bother. The heroine early on becomes a vampire who is attracted to eating (and killing) preteen girls. If that isn't disgusting enough for you the book climaxes with a ceremony involving the torture and killing of 11 people. The heroine is somehwat angsty about the whole thing, but not enough to stop doing it. While appropriate for a horror novel, this is not what I am looking for in a romance novel."
1,Not worth your time reading this book!,I had bought this about 3 years ago for my bestfriends birthday and when she had read it I couldn't belive my ears so I wanted to see how bad it really was. I have been reading romance/vampire stories since I was 15 so I have been able to look past a books cover and other flaws and try and like it but this one was... stupid in the nicest way I can say. It was cool in the first couple of chapters then it just got werid and not in a good way. [...]
3,"awful, yet entrancing...","This could possibly be the worst book i've ever read... but it's so bad that i found it oddly entertaining... it reads as though the authoress had several sketches for storylines in a pile, dropped them, and couldn't be bothered to sort out the pages. it's as though someone took a romance novel and threw it into a blender with a sci-fi channel series, a few manga, several vampire/witch movies, and a children's fey story. as if yet another story element was needed, the tale is set at christmastide... i wouldn't recommend purchasing this book, unless of course the above description appeals to you, but if you stumble upon it in your local library, consider picking it up if only for a good laugh."
1,Total waste of time,I am not even going to dignify this book by writing what it is about. Like many of the other reviewers I read alot and have varied tastes. I had picked up a copy of this book at the same time I bought some of Sherrilyn Kenyon's. I never even made it past page 49. The story was just too weak and psychotic for me. This book left me feeling like I had completely wasted my time and money.
1,Midnight Work,"After a completely stupid one night stand, Sophie discovers her drunk wantonness has lead to her becoming a vampire. She's at first disconcerted, then decides it's cool and essentially goes on a homicidal spree, turning one of her best friends for company, and descending into utter debauchery in hopes of becoming like the vampires on Los Vampiros or in a Hollywood slash and bite movie. The plot, such as it is, wanders all over the place, venturing into the Fey lands, reincarnation, and a bit Christian heresy thrown in for ""good"" measure. At one point, Sophie does become devoted to stopping an evil fey being, but I'm not sure if she wanted to end its evil ways or just didn't want anyone else to have homicidal fun. None of the characters appeared to have anything resembling morals. In short, don't waste time or money on this.Amanda Killgore"
1,Just Awful,"I promised myself I would not write a review unless it was positive, but I hated this book so much that I feel an obligation to save anyone even thinking about purchasing it. First, I agree with all the negatives. This is not a vampire romance it is a violent disgusting portrait of vampire life. If that is what you like to read by all means be my guest. I could hardly continue reading the book once Sophie killed the cab driver, tore Olivier's throat out and then made her friend a vampire just so she could have company. GROSS!!!"
1,This is not a romance and not a good book.,"This book is inexplicably listed in the paranormal romance genre...WTF? The hero and the supposed heroine don't even have scenes together half the time. They have quickie sex in the hallway of a club for like 30 seconds early on (very early) and from then on there is virtually no contact, no conversation, no romance, no nothing except murder and mayheim. The Hero turned the heroine into a vampire...then she turned her friend and they go on a blood-letting crime spree for the rest of the book. I will admit the book was amusing at certain points but I can't say that I liked it overall. The characters were unlikeable and crazy. The plot was non-existent...people just wandered around and ate people, knocked over jewelry stores, etc. Save yourself and avoid this book."
1,Who actually would buy this book?,"Seriously, who would read that description and then buy this book? It clearly paints a picture of the book's utterly hopeless content."
2,Truth in advertising...,"Well, it's called The Midnight Work & I think that's accurate. The author must have picked up a pencil at midnight strung out on atleast a high volume of Starbucks & skectched out the outline of a decent story. And then had a freind publish that outline. Honestly, the book is sooooo sketchy, jumps about, is badly edited,is filled with overly flowery writing at points when the writer felt like going on a tangent in appreciation of her own text, & just doesn't impress.Plus these are sort of your bad vampires that go about snacking on whover they want & killing indiscriminatley. Its like trying to think homicidal maniacs are cute & romantic. But they aren't even great at being horrible. It could have been good had she worked longer than an hour on it but, as is, don't waste your money."
5,An Impressive DVD Set A+++,"This is good real good. Both Masters are very skilled and definetly know street fighting and what to do when your life is on the line. The combination of having Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and Sambo is a real powerful mix and the groundfighting techniques gave me what I was looking for, how to fight on the ground and survive. I spent a lot of time in Tae Kwon Do and Boxing and always felt concerned as to what to do if I didn't take the guy out and the fight went to the pavement. Not anymore this 2 DVD set has all the answers. Anyone looking for ground fighting techniques will find all they need on these 2 DVDs."
3,Very good self defense..,"This is a good self defense video based on grappling, but as far as production goes it does look kind of homemade.. However I would still recommend it for its techniques. As a minor drawback I'd have wished it show some striking techniques too.."
1,Good instructor but . . !!,"The instructor has great experience and well skilled, unfortunately, the making of this DVD is very weak. In summary:1- Camera position is always at the wrong place2- Lighting is very weak, so dark3- Not enough explained the techniques4- The style is more of a class training, which makes it less interesting for someone who want details of skillsIn conclusion:I would not recommend this particular DVD for existing jujitsu guys, its nice for someone who just would like to have an idea about the game or more interested in self-defense"
2,"Beautiful, breakable","Okay, this is probably the coolest looking juice press, at a reasonable price, out there. We were excited and pleased with the juicer, but had to return it when it developed cracks in the pressing mechanism. I would recommend getting the cast-iron Ojex model rather than this beautiful chrome plated zinc alloy, which breaks!Two other smaller problems:1. While the lower cup that holds the orange half is removable, the upper section is not, making for awkward cleanup.2. The lever isn't stable in the up/open position, allowing it to sometimes close unexpectedly and possibly causing injury when cleaning, juicing."
1,Too labor intensive for the price,"I chose this model because it looked beautiful but it's not worth the price for the amount of work it takes to get one glass of orange juice. I had to press an awful amount and my arm started to hurt from all the pressing. If you have a lot of kitchen space and are going to use it once in a blue moon and want to impress guests, then it's fine because it really looks great on the counter. However, I'm going to return mine and spend 3 times as much for a machine operated juicer that won't break my arm or take so long."
1,Broke after 3 uses,"Based on another purchaser's comment, I expected to have to expend some energy using this juicer. I was prepared for that. What I was not prepared for was the fact that after I used it 3 times, the lever mechanism stopped working. It's nearly impossible to pull the lever back up now. At first I was excited about my new juicer, but now I am very disappointed in the quality of this product. I don't recommend it."
5,excellent book!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Jack Criss definitely has a way with words, and he certainly provokes the reader to introspection. His writing is upfront and direct, yet infused with an infectious sense of humor. Mr. Criss seems to have an understanding that belies his years. I recommend you get a copy of Ready, Aim, Right! for yourself and your friends...it will spark interesting discussion!"
1,I expected more...,"When you buy Natori you expect the best. But this product just isn't up to their usual high standard. Most disappointing is the elastic used at the leg and waist openings. For 20 dollars they should be awesome. They aren't.My favorite panty right now is a Nordstrom brand boy short that is really comfortable and costs about 10 bucks. I haven't seen them online, but this is worth a trip to the store."
5,Sensuous and Erotic,"It's difficult to describe why Bruno Bisang's images are so exciting when many similar books are dull and repetitious. I suspect that the photographer has a really deep sensual appreciation of beautiful women, and the results show on every page."
4,Biblical Archaeology in perspective,"I like this book a lot. It's a very accessible introduction to the world of Biblical Archaeology. It shows how Biblical Archaeology fits as a scientific discipline within the other realms of archaeology of the ancient world. It also shows how what we know about the Biblical world from archaeology fits in with what we know archaeologically about other nearby ancient civilizations. Modern scientists treat these realms as separate disciplines but in the ancient world they were inter-related and we profit by better understanding the relationships. This book is bountifully illustrated with beautiful color photographs, many photographs and perspectives that I haven't seen in other books on Biblical Archaeology."
5,Christian Blessings,"Rich and wonderful perspectives of the insatiable love our Lord and Shepherd has for His own. Well written, it should reach every heart. I will share this in prison ministry with men of new and struggling faith who desperately need to know the immeasurable love of their Shepherd. This book would be a great resource to every small Bible study group and could be read in total or in part over the sessions to achieve God's purpose."
2,Not much to do with Bible Archaeology...,"I was disappointed with this book. It would be better titled ""Ancient Civilizations of the Bible"". It has the occassional reference to the Israelites or Jewish figures, but few specifics to archaeology that directly relates to the Bible. In that regard, it is interesting, but not what I was looking for.I guess my biggest complaint is the author's insistance that archaeology cannot be used to ""prove"" the Bible. While I understand the point, it would have been nice to have been at least presented with some archaeological evidence to substantiate historical things in the Bible. There are plenty of books about ancient civilizations but few that pull together all of the numerous Biblical archaeological finds which academia so often glosses over or minimizes. The authors in this book seem to be more concerned with their standing in the academic community than illuminating the rest of us. I guess my search will continue for that type of book..."
2,Disappointed,"This book is really a brief history of the ancient world. The first 94 pages have little to do with the Bible much less Bible archaeology. If you want a thumb nail sketch of the ""Rise and Fall of the Assyrian Empire,"" or the ""Rise and Fall of the Chaldean Empire,"" or ""Egypt prior to Abraham,"" you might like this book. Otherwise, you will be disappointed."
4,"Helpful Write Up, Map and Pictures",The text is helpful in its write up to the layman of Bible archaeology and listing each period of time. The maps and pictures are very clear when reading the write up of what is contained in each picture. The writers condense the abundance of information into a format this readily understandable. I would recommend this book on this topic.
4,for use as a text book,"im using it for a biblical archeology class, and its a great text book. very easy to understand and its full of helpful maps an pictures. i wish every text book was this easy to read."
5,Great Music,"I Have Listened To Both CDs That Have Been Released By The Schuers And I Have Loved Their Music Since I Did. I Am Reminded of DMB When I Listen To Them, But They Still Have A Diffrence From DMB In Their Music. I Have To Say, I Havent Heard Of These Guys Around PA, And I'm Supprised I Havent. This Band And CD Have A Spot In Music Talent Waiting For Them. Dont Miss Out On The Band That Few People Know, But For Those That Do Know Of Them They Would All Tell You The Same Thing. BUY THIS CD!! You Wount Be Sorry You Did."
4,4.5 stars for a very good read,"This was my first Carla Kelly novel and she has written many. I was so impressed at how historically accurate it was and how she brought to life the era with her plot and dialog. There was a good deal of suspense that unfolded along with the romance.The story is of an unlikely alliance of an Irish servant woman with a peer of the realm. She has a troubled past that is uncovered slowly throughout the story. He has a troubled past and is in need of overcoming a tragedy. Together they help each other.The writing is top notch, the characterization is top notch, the story is wonderful and the only thing lacking is a bit of romantic steam. This was an exceptionally good read."
4,A great read!!,I really enjoyed this book. I loved the banter between Emma and Lord R. I loved seeing the change the evolved in each of them. Would highly recommend. This will go in my favorites file on my kindle!
3,spoilers,"This is a two and a half star book. I would have given it three stars, which means worth a read once, but at the end we're left hanging, not knowing what's happened to two characters. If there's a sequel, I couldn't find a trace of it. Also, parts are grim."
5,Loved it!,"I loved this book! Carla Kelly is an excellent writer. I love how she developed her characters and brought us to love them. When I started this book, I didn't know if I would make it through the first few chapters because I really couldn't stand Lord Ragsdale. I'm so glad I stuck with it. You will be too. A good read that I would recommend. I also loved Miss Grimsleys Oxford Career, Mrs. Drew Plays Her Hand, and Marian's Christmas Wish. I'm a huge fan of these sweet, clean love stories."
1,Just a repeat,8 Minute Legs is okay in and of itself-but don't bother buying it if you buy 8 Minute Buns with the 8 Minute Thighs extra!8 Minute Legs IS 8 Minute Thighs-It's the SAME EXACT WORKOUT!
2,I would recommond eight-minute buns instead!,"I didn't find this workout as challenging as I would like it to be. However, it may be a better workout for me if light-weight ankle weights were added for resistance. I think the lunges are great!"
5,THE NEW WWF IS AWSOME,I just bought this cd. This is Great. It is really cool how they like revise the entrance themes and add some hip hop vibe to them. this is even good even if you are not a rap fan. They Really did a good job with this CD. SO BUY It!
5,da B-O-M-B!,this is the best WWF cd ever! everyone should check it out if you like rab/r&b. My favorite is the Run DMC track.
4,Don't be fooled by the high ratings!,"Although I gave this album a 4 star rating it was mainly on the basis of the fact that RUN D.M.C.'s version of The Kings was that D@MN good. Although I think many of the other songs are completely lacking in achieving the ""feel"" that the DX theme does, I do believe that the WWF has again put out well. The only thing that this Album is really lacking is the Wyclef Jean/Rock version of It Doesn't Matter. I personally am waiting for the follow up to this Album which should contain hits like Kid Rock's American BadA$$ and the Wyclef Jean/Rock It Doesn't Matter."
5,THE BEST EVER,OMG WWF HAS DONE THE BEST EVERIN WWF MUSIC. THIS IS THE BESTWWF MUSIC EVER. WWF IS NUMBER1.NO ONE EVER CAN BEAT THE WWFEVER.WHAT A CD.GOT MY MONEY'SWORTH AND STILL GOING.
2,A Big Disappointment,"People don't listen to what the WWF tells you on Raw about this horrific CD. I'm the biggest fan of wrestling, but I hate this CD. It has only a few good songs. The best is ""Hell Yeah"" with Snoop. That song is tight. Triple H has a great remake as well. Also The DX song which if your a wrestling fan have heard over and over again. Trust me, this CD is a laughing stock and the WWF should be smacked!"
5,think wwf+rap,IF U LIKE THE WWF AND RAP BUY TIS CD! ITS A GREAT CD!IT HAS ALL THE HOTEST RAPPERS!CHECK OUT METHOD MANS SONG!
2,I shared Jack's thinking,"I was at Jack Ellis placetoday. Me and him are HighSchool buds. And he helpedme to see not to get the CDWWF Aggression i wanted. He pointed to alot of thing'sthe WWF content has. I saidi know Jack i watch The WWFevery time it's on. jack saiddoes your boy watch it. I saidyeppers. He said you sould be ashamed. Because of al thatcontent filth and language.I said i get the point. Andour right. I wont buy the CD.jack says it's up to you towatch. But id sure keep Paulaway. But you know he willlisten to that CD. I said,OKjack. So i didnt get it andi garbaged the others away.But i did right. So i canttell you to get it. MY WIFE CANDY WAS ON CLOUD 9.SHE WAS SO HAPPY."
3,Not bad then again not good,"I am not even going to waste much space reviewing this C.D. Basically 5 songs were good and great the rest were all trash so im just gonna review the 5 songs.The first Track Degeneration X is very hott, Run -Dmc does an almost perfect rendition of Dx's music! you can play it over and overThe next is Method mans Know Your Role which is great cause it catches all of the rocks catch phrases its pretty funnyOh screw it why bother Just Dl it dont bother buying it PEace"
1,Too dissappointed - NO LO RECOMIENDO,"The name of this cd must be ""WWF RAP AGRESSION"", because i expected the original theme. Next time i will have more time to read the comments instead of believing in the ranking.ES UN CD DE RAP ...!"
1,not good,this cd is absolutely terrible i cant believe they actually released this they make a total mochary of their songs all i can say is that is terrible
4,WWF in 'da hood.,"Aggression is just what the album namesake states: Your favorite WWF superstar themes set to a hard edge rap lyrical twist.Many of the songs are very creative and really fun like the DX Theme from RUN DMC, and The Rock's Theme, and most definetly Ice T's version of teh Godfather's Theme. For those artists that spent time learning the wrestling lingo and trademark moves of their respective wrestlers, the songs are ingenious.However, there are a few odd choices. Though Gangrel's theme is pretty cool, how was that picked over a more popular group like Tool Cool? Also there are a few songs that seem to have really very little to do with the actual wrestler other than a few vague refrences. If you weren't a huge WWF fan, some of these refrences would get lost to you and you wouldn't be able to identify the song to the wrestler.Overall, it is well done, and is definetly a fast paced album lending itslef to a good workout or a boost of energy if you need it."
4,wwf aggression,"the music was great. the ""great one"" is in this and you give him your money to smell what the rock is cooking. walls of jerhico is an awesome remix and stone cold theme is off the hook. big show was alittle bit of a down fall but the DX theme conter reacts it by Run Dmc tearing up the mic."
2,Rap Meets Wrestling,"A list of talented rappers do their own versions of WWF theme songs. Tracks like Run-DMC's ""King Of Rock"" and Ice-T's ""Pimpin' Ain't Easy"" made for effective but dated theme songs but most of this album just wastes decent themes and makes underrated rappers like Bad Azz and Ras Kass seem bored and uninspired. Method Man's ode to The Rock is worth a listen and ODB's lyrics on Mankind's ""Wreck"" are worth a chuckle. I purchased many years ago and the CD currently sits on the bottom of my CD pile somewhere."
3,It's ok,"Some of the song lyrics really have nothing to do with the WWF wrestlers. For example, the lyrics for The Undertaker's song talk more about the rappers themsleves than the Undertaker. I wonder why the WWF approved some of these lyrics that don't make sense...At the other end of the spectrum, Method Man's version of The Rock's music is a lyrical masterpiece. Sure, Method Man had a lot to draw from (considering The Rock's many catch phrases), but it still represents how good a song can be if thought is given to the lyrics."
2,Very disappointing !,"The other WWF CD were excellent, but this is not really excellent even if there are in the best rap men of the USA. Sorry..."
2,Not bad,"ITS TRUE,ITS TRUE. THIS ISN'TBAD. MY BOTHER ALLOWED ME TOLISTEN TO HIS WWF CD. BUT NEEDTO POINT OUT WITHOUT RIC FLAIRANYTHING STINK'S. AND THAT ISTHE BOTTOM LINE BECAUSE RICFLAIR SAID SO."
4,MY way of thinking on it.,I think satan is laughing hisbutt off at Vince Mcmahon andeveryone who is letting therethere little kid's watch thissmut. Glad Satans not laughing at me...LOL
3,Aggression,"WWF Aggression is nothing but an attempt by the WWF to include some of the Hip-Hop listeners. Although to do this you'd have to include some good songs. Half of these songs don't have anything to do with the corresponding WWF theme. The Rock's sounds like a black Jerry Lawler announcing a match, and No Chance In Hell is completely pathetic. However Snoop Dogg's ""Hell Yeah"" and Badd Azz & Technic's ""You Ain't Hard"" are great representations of the real theme. maybe next time Vince."
2,"Buy if you like rap, not WWF","I was dissappointed with this CD. After hearing Run DMC's ""The Kings"" and Method Man's ""Know Your Role"" on WWF Smackdown, I thought this would be a cool CD. I was wrong. Most of the songs on here don't have anything to do with wrestling(ODB and Kool Keith ""Wreck"" which talks about barfing on a convertible top?) There are a couple good songs-The Kings, Know your Role, Hell Yeah-but thats about it. I know that most WWF fans are going to do what I did, that is buy it because it's WWF. But the only reason you should buy this CD is either if your a rap fan or need a coaster for your coffee mug."
1,WWF Aggression is more like WWF Garbage,"WWF Aggression is the worst CD I have ever bought. I bought it for the WWF Theme songs, and just to see what the artists did to the songs. The first time I listened to it, I couldn't believe I paid money for it! The artists took the songs, chopped them up, and added a bunch of words that make no sense, and put it on a CD. If you like rock music, then I SUGGEST NOT BUYING it and if you like WWF Music, I HIGHLY SUGGEST NOT BUYING it! Absolutely horrible. If you want REAL WWF music, then try WWF The Music Volume 4."
5,"Deep, Dark & Nasty!",Palash has outdone himself with this first solo compilation! The track selection is superb and his mixing is flawless. I had certain expectations being a huge fan of Saeed & Palash and I was just blown away when I popped this in my CD player!
4,A wonderful sampling,"Though perhaps not the definitive versions of all the songs presented, this collection is the best I've heard to give a newcomer to ""elliniki musiki"" entree into the last few decades of Greek popular music (which until very recently WAS ""bouzouki"").Perhaps the only real complaint I had was that the theme from ""Pote tin Kyriaki"" (Never on Sunday) wasn't included. Yes, I know the film was made for Western audiences, but the song ... pure Greek, and sadly, missing from this collection."
2,Don't Wast Your Money,"This CD is not very good I bought it and I am sorry I did, If you want some great Greek Bouzouki music try to fine sone Greek Bouzouki by George Zambetas he is known as the master of playing a Bouzouki"
1,Don't buy with Casio EX-H10,"I bought this as a recommended purchase from Amazon with a Casio EX-H10 camera, and it is too small for that camera."
4,Perfect fit for my camera!,"I have a Cannon UltraSlim Digital Camera...it fits perfect, as an extra pocket to store an extra battery or memory card if needed and it's light weight! I would recommend this item!"
4,D20 Worldbook needs cleaning up.........,"Basically, this Worldbook has a few flaws. It could have used a section of exactly which races in the book are playable PC races and which are not. Also, while the book deals with the prestige classes in the 3rd edition DMG it doesn't deal with the races and monsters in the Monster Manual and Player's Handbook (particularly the Dwarves, Half-orcs, Half-elves, Elves, Gnomes, and Halflings, I assume that from reading the book that none of these races exist in Diomin or perhaps the are on a different continent). It also includes a new character class, the shaman, and rules for dealing with spirits and 3 new character races.Fortunately these mistakes have been cleared up with thier free release of Outpost Qether on the company's website.Overall, this is an interesting book, but it neededsome clearing up of the materials contained within it."
5,Talbot and Gayatri,"I first read this book around 1978, when Talbot was teaching at Hobart and William Smith Colleges, and so was I. I read it because Talbot, a kind and gentle friend, had written it. But then I saw that Gayatri, to whom Talbot had been married, was in it. It was not only about Gayatri, but about Cornell, where they both were students, about Iowa, about pigs, and about one extraordinary cat.Later the book became quite difficult to find. I am happy to see that this book is on the market again. It is humble, detailed, and very very funny. The funniest parts are about Talbot's wife at the time. The most gripping and suspenseful part is about a pig and this heroic cat. If you know Cornell, if you know cats, if you are familiar with pigs, and/or of course if you are familiar with the work and demeanor of Gayatri Spivak, this book is a must-read. Even if you are not familiar with any of these creatures, you will enjoy the book. I loved it."
5,A novel about Gayatri Spivak?,"This novel about Gayatri Spivak is a great read for anyone interested in the early life of the famous feminist and radical marxist. No sign of radicalism at this stage of her life, but perhaps it developed later."
4,I like it,"I love this, but it really only helps me when it is warmed up rather than as cold therapy. For cold therapy I'd rather use cucumbers or aloe. Still, the warning on the front is extremely off putting. This, and other bed buddy products warn ""NEVER"" to use it on the eyes as warm. Does anyone know why? I've called the company, I've done some preliminary internet searches. The warm heat helps, but I have no idea why it is cautioned strongly not to do this. Help?"
2,"Heats up OK, but smells bad!","I used this product when I had an allergy-related sinus infection. The sinus pack heated up well, maintained temperature, etc. The only problem is that it had a peculiar smell, and I did not like to use it. I guess it is OK if you don't have allergies!"
3,Only one bad thing to say..make that two,"Love, love, love this product. It works, I use it more as a daily sleep mask and I noticed a decrease in my migraines. My two complaints, 1) the material, it is fine, soft and all but it holds onto dog hair like a brush. As an owner of three dogs there is no getting around having hair in the air. More than once I woke up with a stinging pain in my eye and it turns out that a dog hair has made its way into my eye (no matter how hard I try to keep it hair free). 2) Oprah could never wear this. The strap is not long enough to accommodate a slightly larger than average cranium. For both issues I have found a way around them (homemade pillow case and extended the velcro)so I would say that I am 90% happy, would be 110% if they enhanced it ever so slightly."
2,Not what you would expect!,"I purchased this pack for temporary relief from chronic migraines. I put this pack in the freezer for several hours. I took it out to try it out and this is what I found: The cover on the bed buddy sinus pack is so thick that you can barely feel the cold through it.Also, the cover is NOT removeable.I returned this product and got my money back."
3,Different than shown in pic and described in item info,"I have been extremely pleased with this product in the past. I was looking to replace my old bed buddy sinus pack. When I searched Amazon I found 2 different styles: one without a velcro strap (like the ones I had previously) and one with a velcro strap. This particular one mentioned nothing about a strap, nor did the pictures indicate that there was a strap. I ordered from this company in particular because I did not want a strap on mine. However, when I got the product it had a strap. Unfortunately, I had a cold and desperately needed to use the bed buddy, or I would have returned it, considering it is different than the product I ordered. It still works and is virtually the same except for the velcro strap, which makes it less versatile and less comfortable than the previous style I was expecting."
5,Was so happy to find this book!!!,"I read this book years ago. I didn't put it down back then until I was finished with it(except for bathroom breaks of course ;<} My family thought I locked myself in my room because I was sick! It's interesting to feel familiar or different thoughts in how the book affected me back then in my youth & now in adulthood. Changes vs steadfastness in my views, outlook on life & people, dreams..."
5,Back to the Basics,"Despite the growing criticism The White Stripes were getting because Seven Nation Army was overplayed, Elephant is still one of my favorite albums.HOWEVERI do NOT think this album is perfect. Tracks like ""Cold, Cold Night"" and ""I want to be the Boy"" are quite boring, and i would have given this CD 4.5 stars if I could have. As this is, of course, not possible, the Stripes got the 5 on the basis that the lower quality songs were not an attempt to take the band mainstream.This being said, when Jack and Meg nail a song, they do it perfectly. Standout tracks include ""Black Math"" (my personal favourite) ""There ain't no rom for you here"", and all the other garage rock tracks. Strangely, I also liked ""It's true that we love one another"", which I somehow found to be kind of Beatle-esque (if there were girls in the Beatles)Another great disc from the Whites. Highly recommended."
2,Nothing Special,"this album is trash, they rip off other bands such as The Cure, John Lennon. this guy Jack (if that is his real name) sounds like a bad version (...). And the drums suck, like really. Walt Mink had a chick drummer and she could show me up, but this (...), which is fitting with the music. I dislike this album a lot, If You're Looking For Indie Rock don't turn to MTV.(...)"
4,Say hello to the Elephant,"This band is notorious for pumping out new albums left and/or right. And in most circumstances that ends up with half a$$ed albums that are just out for making an extra buck. But that is never been so with the White Stripes. They are continually able to put out quality rock and roll. They picked a great single to get out on the radio with ""7 nation army"", the song has a great riff that just sticks inside your brain for hours at a time. Other quality tracks include ""Girl, You have no faith in medicine"" and ""Black math"". If you are a fan of these pair of musicians then head out and hop on the Elephant."
5,Fantastic!!!,This CD if the White Stripes 4th CD and one there best CD's next to White Blood Cells in my opinion. Buy this CD if your just looking into the White Stripes then look into White Blood Cells a great CD to add to any collection. The White Stripes are just good and for me the duo thing just makes them better. We need more bands like this.
3,Amazing Guitar Work and Charts; Weak Lyrics,"I don't know about calling two people a band but these two put out an amazing amount of blues rock music. I believe other reviewers that this is one of their best albums and I liked it well enough to later purchase De Stijl. Once in a while they really combine words and music to good effect but they have yet to really hit on both sides of the job to produce something like Bruce Springsteen did on Born to Run, etc. Jack White is a 'guitar god' and just that could justify a purchase. His cover of 'I Just Don't Know What To Do With Myself' is almost over-the-top dramatic. It is one of my favorite cuts on this album."
1,do not buy this,"do not buy this album. besides the hype, this band does nothing but take up space. They are not special, the record is not that good. Actually it's kind of repetitive. and the fact that SPIN magazine said this was the top cd of 2003, i think i better go change my underwear then throw up. better music out there, for your better money..."
1,Exceptional,"This is the White Stripes best album to date. The production is minimalistic, the lyrics are excellent, and the melodies are powerful. Jacks guitar, Megs simple drumming, and Jacks heartfelt vocals combine to create some of the best music we have today. Favorites include ""The Air Near My Fingers"", ""Seven Nation Army"", ""Hypnotize"", ""I Just Don't Know What To Do With Myself"" (on which Jack sounds as though he's about to weep), ""There's No Home For You Here"", ""The Hardest Button to Button"", and ""You've Got Her In Your Pocket"", though they're all wonderful. So buy this!"
3,what?,"""This band is too garagerock what the backstreet boys were to punkrock."" So you're saying this is the exact opposite of garage rock? What on earth do the backstreet boys have to do with punk, let alone rock?"
2,Elephant?,"Now, i just bought this cd, and while the music and stuff is OK, the vocals and feel of the music stinks. I would recomend downloading "" seven nation army "" if you want the highlight of the cd. Not really that good of a cd for anyone who likes punk, metal, ..or really anything besides 70s music.."
1,Blandness!,"This cd is just a bunch of talentless noise disguised as brilliance. After a few listens, and after a few comparisons to other rock records, you will probably see that Elephant is nothing more than another major label scam.If you want something good, check out Interpol's ""Turn On The Bright Lights""."
1,Oh my,"Beyond the cadaver-esque ""look"" and the hype, what is the appeal of this? Terrible musicianship is not cool, it's pathetic. And they're already recycling riffs from their last album???!!! Sad."
1,people who bought this also bought Fingernails on a chalkboard,The one star is just to have my review seen. I can't seriously review inaudible noise. You really need to listen to the sounds this band is totally ripping off in an offensive way. Pick up a guitar and you'll learn these songs in 2 minutes flat and never want to play them again. Death to retro rock!
5,One Of The Best CD's I Have Heard Ever!,The White Stripes are by far my favourite band. Everyone was expecting great things with ELEPHANT and in my opinion it did not dissapoint. It was everything I thought it would be and more! I really enjoy there style of music and Jacks voice. He plays the guitar like no other and Meg is amazing on her drums. I really can't wait untill The white Stripes give us another masterpeice of an album!
2,uninspired simplistic guitar paired with mundane drums,"To put it bluntly, this album is horrible, the guitar riffs are soo unbelieveably simple and un-creative (ie seven nation army) I mean common, anyone could pick up a guitar and be able to play this stuff within 2 weeks. Then add in the repetative, non-dynamic drums, it makes for an agonizing, dreadful listen. spare yourself, please."
4,Excellent work from start to finish (almost),"Ok first let me preface this review by saying that my two favourite bands are Tool and Nine Inch Nails. So you could say that I wasn't necessarily into this type of music. Despite that, I found this to be a phenomenal album. This CD just ROCKS. I have not quite heard anything like this before. The band's quirky flavour of blues-rock works perfectly. I could have done without track 14, but hey, everybody deserves to have a little fun every now and then right?"
2,Letdown,"After hearing Fell in Love With a Girl and Dead Leaves and the Dirty Ground I really felt like this album would be good, not to mention all the hype it was getting. After listening to it I felt like most of the songs, and especially the lyircs on songs like Little Acorns, were forced. The cover of the Burt Bacharach song, I Just Don't Know What To Do Myself, sounds akward and is not easy to listen to. I really did like Ball and Biscuit, especially the guitar solos, though and if it weren't for that song I think this would only get 1 star."
5,2003 meets 1973,"is it led zeppelin? sounds like it often, rocks like it often, but it aint. this cd is one of the tops of 2003. and this comes from a non-zeppelin fan. straight up rock and roll with no pretenses."
2,Elephant by the White Stripes,"I bought this album for the song Ball & Biscuit. Was glad Seven Nation Army was on it. Other than that - not really crazy about it, but it was a good price."
2,Sub-par,"Basically a rip off of the old classic sound. The single ""Seven Nation Army"" is barely tolerable, and way to repetitive. The CD is filled with tracks that just take up space, this is by far their worst CD to date. The fact that Rolling Stone called this CD a classic, goes right with their opinion that 8 Mile was also one of the best films of the year. Who the heck do they have writing for that magazine. If you like White Stripes, you will be heavily dissapointed."
2,They could do better....,"You can tell from a couple of songs that they have talent and are good songwriters, but I think they have much more capability. It can get dull. They could play better on their instruments, and you cannot have that good of a band with just a guitar and a drumset. You don't have to get new members but at least create some kind of diversity with changing styles and maybe adding instruments once in awhile."
4,Great Sound,"I'm really surprised by how many people have posted poor reviews for a good band. I can understand if it's not your taste but there is no way this album is boring. I'm also tired of people saying they've ripped off other bands, EVERY BAND HAS RIPPED OFF ANOTHER BAND. Of course they're going to use forms and styles they like of other bands. Anyway, this is one of my favorite bands with a great sound. My favorite songs are ""Black Math"", ""I Just Don't What To Do With Myself"", and ""Ball and Biscuit"". I usually skip ""In The Cold, Cold Night"" (no offense to Meg) & ""Well It's True That We Love Another"" Good album along with De Stijl."
4,"Very good, but VERY underwhelming.","This is probably the most overrated album since the Strokes debut. Don't get me wrong. This is fantastic music. Call it what you want; garage, blues, etc. but this is very good rock music. Jack White as a producer is a genius. But De-Stijl is still their masterpiece and I never understood why that album did not get the acclaim that Elephant is receiving. It is better by far, but I like this album more than White Blood Cells. Of course you must get them all as every album is better than 80% of anything else out there now."
5,White Stripes - Elephant,"Powerful, creepy, and wonderful, this album can to make you feel the music with a well-developed bass and entrancing lyrics. Their dynamic level goes from a tranquil whisper to an overwhelming explosion, but they find a way to make each song flow to the next and stay within it itself. It stays modern while keeping a special undefinable quality that only the classics have. From the powerful ""Black Math"", to the bone-chilling ""In the Cold, Cold Night"", to the oh-so-sweet ""I Want to be the Boy to Warm your Mother's Heart"" and ""You've Got Her in your Pocket"", and the astoundingly brilliant ""Seven Nation Army"", this is the best album of the year, and a worthwhile addition to any music library."
5,Simply enjoyable,I will admit I like many of the highly symphonic pieces out there that some people complain about but rhythmic music played on few instruments has a special place too. White Stripes did good.
5,THE best mainstream band out there,"I saw them live on the 23rd and it blew me away!!! Jack White's guitar playing is fairly simple in some parts but his leads are extraordinary! I love Meg White's drum style, it seems very childish and silly-which is a good thing to me, it is impossible to say what song is the best on the album-they're all good!!"
4,Bare Bones,Good record. Great raw guitar sounds and energy. Almost more of a blues record really. But I'm afraid I don't think it's as amazing as some of the press is giving it credit for. Carrying on the great Detroit tradition of raw rock and roll. I've been listening to the new Romantics CD 61/49 (killer) and I'm reminded of how many great influences these two must have had.
2,ZZZZzzz,"this album puts me to sleep. all right you got a formula great how about some songwriting, although I do like that button song.bottom line if the white stripes really are the de rigeur of modern rock how come all them songs sound the same, and how come that dude wants to be a bad-ass dandy?what is a bad-ass dandy? who took all my stolen candy.(15 second guitar solo)man these things just write themselves"
5,Great !,This is the best music I've heard since the 60's.White Stripes are a fabulous talent!Songs are meaningful.I love this amazing album.
2,why won't anyone say it?,"This album sucks.This band is overhyped.So what if they did the entire album on old equipment.Did they push the recording beyond any album that had been done in the 60's or 70's?C'mon ""Electric Ladyland""IT IS A GIMMICK!!"
5,classic,"If you like music and you don't love this album, then there is something seriously wrong with you."
2,Ummm... I don't get it,"I just don't get it. Yeah, the album is raw and it's ok... but all of the attention that the White Stripes are getting, for me, is a bit undeserved. I think that I bought this album expecting a timeless album from all of the hype. Now I listen to it after about 4 listenings ... and to be honest... it's just a bit tired."
3,Don't get me wrong,"Don't get me wrong about the 3 stars....This album has more to offer then most anything else that will come out this year....and i fall more in love with meg with every drum beat...but all this album really did for me was make me realize how great an album De Stijl is (which I am listening to as I write this). If your new to the Stripes, I recommend you pick that album up if you really want to experience what all the fuss is about, then pick up White Blood Cells - This is a good album...but it can wait."
5,How could this not get 5 stars...,"Just reading the one star reviews makes me laugh. ""O Yeah, Jack White just, uh, puts out, um, distorted guitar noise, and doesn't even know how to write music"" some of you say. Considering I've listened to this album straight through about 30 different times, I think I would probably know what I'm talking about. Each song has its own unique sound, and all are memorable. Some are loud and filled with yelling and the sounds of eletric guitar, others are soft and acoustic, and others are mix of both. Jack brilliantly combines elements of punk, garage rock, classic rock, blues, and sometimes a little bit of country (Hotel Yorba) into one amazing CD. Since it's obvious that Jack has more talent in his pinkie than you a$$ bandits have in your whole body, it would be wise to shut the hell up and enjoy the music."
3,Very average,"Elephant is a very uneven and overated album. I'm sorry but such a minimalist band like the White Stripes has no room to experiment like they have tried to do on this album. They should just stick to what they do best, ala The Strokes. ""Seven nation army"" and ""Hardest button to button"" are good, excellent in fact. ""Hypnotize"" and ""Black math"" are very nice too. But then we have crap like ""Ball and biscuit"", ""Little acorns"", ""In the cold cold night"" and the depressing ballad ""You've got her in your pocket"" which sounds corny as hell. There's also an awful cover of a burt bacharach song. I appreciate the Stripes trying new things but it all sounds too gimmicky to me."
4,"Buy it, listen to it, put it away for a while, listen again","I fell in love with ""White Blood Cells"" in a way that I didn't fall in love with this album. It's a good album but it's not a GREAT album. I suggest that you go out and buy it, listen to it and then put it away for a while and then listen to it again. This is an album that you don't want to get tired of. If you listen to this album over and over again you will learn to hate this band. I personally really love this band but this album is just another white stripes record. Nothing really special. Seven Nation Army was a bit of change but not too much. The sound is cleaned up a little but that's only because they have more money to spend on production. I think that the white stripes have a masterpiece waiting inside of them but this is not it. I like this record but I don't love it. But I do love the white stripes. Does any of this make sense?"
5,"WHITE STRIPES, INDEED.","Since their first albumn, the White Stripes keep getting better and better with time, and with every albumn they make. Five stars for having a variety of guitar solos, simple but catch & meaningful drum beats, blues,& punk/alternative rock, laid back & classic rock approach. Elephant is a must have albumn to purchase for your CD collection. Simple, longer, heart felt, & fun are the descriptions of this new albumn. BUY IT."
5,"Puts ""White Blood Cells"" to shame","First of all, do NOT listen to any other reviews written thus far. THERE IS NO BASS ANYWHERE IN THE WHITE STRIPES. If anybody looked in to it or had any musical talent, they would know that Jack is using an Octave pedal, which takes down the sound of every string by 1 or 2 octaves. This gives the impression that there is bass used. But I can guarantee that there is no bass used by the White Stripes. I never want to hear such claims about an excellent band again, especially by complete idiots. Anyway, every song is awesome."
4,Very good,"I had never heard of White Stripes until a friend loaned me a copy. The first 4 tracks are amazing. I can do without the 5th track, but it is an amazing album overall. I couldn't believe there are only 2 of them in the band! They sound like a throwback to '70s classic rock, and he sounds a lot like Robert Plant on some tracks. My only criticism (other than track 5) is that the songs don't go togteher very well. It's all over the place as far as genre."
4,The band has talent but the album loses some of the edge,"I dismissed the White Stripes as so much hype until I decided to finally see what all the hubbub was about and gave ""White Blood Cells"" a listen. That album blew me away as I realized the enormous songwriting and musical ability of Jack & Meg White (who are NOT brother and sister, BTW.) Jack's wide range of influences is apparent on that album and ""Elephant.""There are some truly remarkable tracks on ""Elephant"" and doubtless ""Seven Nation Army"" is one of them, but overall the album isn't as strong as ""White Blood Cells."" It gives me the impression that they make music to satisfy themselves, which I think is great, but for my taste, this disc falls a tad short.That said, it is still a very fine album and an enjoyable listen. If you like rock and have a keen sense of humor, this will be right up your alley."
4,white stripes review,well what atracted me to the white stripes is meg white and her beauty..upper torso and lower...she rocks my world and jack is lucky!...but i finaly got into their music when that dead leaves song came out but it didnt make me want to buy the album.but when 7 nation army came out and seeing the kick a$$ video made me want to go down to borders and spend all my money.i am pleased with the album and i listen to it often and i give it 4 stars..i think its good to add other instruments to the music cause that guitar and drum beat gets boring..i think this is some what like the white album magnatude...i do recommend it to people but listen to it before buying it
2,A bad memory that you won't forget for a long time,"Yank four-piece the White Stripes - consisting of Jack White, Meg White, and their respective egos - used to be good when nobody paid them any attention. The album before this, whatever it was called, was a masterpiece of raw, untainted rock 'n' roll. Then they got all artsy and old-school and started trying to make statements about the state of the music industry today (which is to say, dire) by using 1920s (or whenever) equipment. All very well and good, but ultimately pointless when your head swells over your eyeballs and you can't see the pencil in order to write a decent song."
5,An Emerging Classic,"I bought this CD on a whim due to the uncanny ability of ""Seven Nation Army"" to stick in my head and I can only say this is an absolutely incredible album. My personal favorites now are ""Black Math"" and ""Ball and Biscuit."" For a time I did not fully realize what exactly drew me so intensely to it until someone said to me regarding the Whites ""I'm not into classic rock."" Then it hit me: as a lover of late-60's to early-80's rock from S&G to the Stones to early punk, this album works some magic to recall to mind the days when rock was what I would hesitate to call ""pure"" but seems to avoid description otherwise.Oh, and don't let the quirky cover fool you: this album does not contain a shread of gimic. Elephant is packed with very solid lyrics and some truly amazing electric guitar passages that make me keep turning up the volume. I find it hard to get all the way through this CD becuase I keep wanting to hear the songs over again as soon as they have finished."
4,Amazing!,Nothing can compares the sound of vinyls and more impressive is how warm the guitar sounds!!! The presentation paper of the cover is different and nice but It will be better if the vinyls were 180 grams.
5,Amazing!,"The vinyl came a few weeks early, and came in great shape and I very happy with it. I love it, its perfect."
5,Elephant review (cd),"One of the best album i own, highly recommended it. excellent service got here on the first day of time frame."
4,Early 1960s blues-based rock without the innocence,"Hard, dark takes on early 1960s music, with direct references to Stones, Pete Townsend, Burt Bacharach (!). This blues-based music is uncomplicated and uncompromising. Instrumentation changes from track to track. Noir music is created by recycling retro music through filters that remove 1960s innocence, thickening and toughening the music, stripping passion to leave a matter-of-fact hard, rough metallic surface. Stand outs: tr 6--I want to be the boy to warm his mother's heart. Quiet, earnest country blues that Pete Townshend could have written. Great slide guitar bridge. Tr 13--Girl, you have no faith in medicine. This head banging garage-rock, punk rave up contrasts a dirt-simple musical setting with a meth-spun vocal."
4,white stripes keep it going,"Like most white stripes albums, Elephant has great songs and weak songs. They have a great writing ability but the performance is, sometimes lacking. Overall, though, I'm a big fan."
5,Different but Interesting,"I first heard of The White Stripes when I saw that they were nominated for some Grammys. After watching the Grammys this year, I sort of caught on to their performance of ""Seven Nation Army"". It has a good beat and is fun to listen to.So I decided to buy their album. I was a little hesitant, because I normally do not listen to this kind of music (Indie Rock, etc.). BUT I have to say that I'm glad I bought the CD. The music is exciting and full of energy. They are a great classic rock band. I mean, their style is classic. They sound like they are from the 60's. I really enjoy the CD. If you liked ""Seven Nation Army"", you will like the CD."
3,3 stars for effort,"Not the genius groundbreaking album that it's cracked up to be. I'll admit, I enjoyed a couple songs. ""Ball and Biscuit"" is a straight-on rocker, and proves that Jack White is a pretty decent guitarist (but not 17th greatest of all time as rolling stone said!). But as other people have said Meg White is a very mediocre drummer and the album sounds bland and boring without bass. An alright album but I personally don't think they deserve all the hype."
4,The album just keeps getting better...,"Rarely have I picked up an album with such high anticipation (Rolling Stone gave this 5 stars) and actually ended up agreeing. First listen didn't blow me away. Second listen and I started to pick up a bit of a Beatles vibe. By the fourth listen (all in the same day - headphones at work) I realized that his album features some diverse lyrics and musicianship. It didn't sound like anything already out there - the cookie cutter does not apply to Jack White - and the album provided changes in speed, sound that make it a great album. The only reason it didn't get 5 stars (as petty as it sounds), is that although the last song is tongue in cheek, they should have omitted it. Which means I had to skip a song...so it can't be perfect, but a tremendous album nontheless."
3,I hate these guys but the album is still good.,"Seven nation army is the best song on the album, the rest range from being good to downright retarded. On one track you have to listen to a man talk about how squirrels hide their nuts for a minute and a half."
1,Horrible ...,"This CD is horrible. I found no redeeming quality to it on a musical vein. All of the great albums you can listen to over and over again and discover new things because there are subtle layers and textures there. Here there is none. You can't get very complicated with a guitar and simple four piece drum set. The simple poppy hooks might be fine for someone with no real musical taste but when you listen to as many new releases as I do it get's very old, very quick. I wouldn't be surprised if this record will be mocked some day in the future as the downfall of the pop culture of the 90's to bring in a new genre for the 00's.All in all ""The White Stripes"" are terribly overrated and in my opinion do not live up to the hype, they collapse and burn under the pressure."
1,"this cd is boring, so buy feeder or muse instead","I bought this Cd after seven nation army came out, but I was really disappointed with the rest of the album. The only other good song on it was black math and even that wasnt brilliant. I think the way there is only a couple of instruments is different but it means that the songs sound similar and makes them sound like they aren't going newhere because there is nothing to build up to. It doesnt feel like there is ne energy going into the music and the lyrics are not v.meaningful. the whole album just lacks depth with the lyrics and the instruments."
2,Too Cool [update],"I'm updating my review of Elephant after reading through some of the previous posts here. One post stood out. Buried in this huge list of reviews is someone who shared his 1-star opinion and had the ""big ones"" to post a link to his own two-man show. His songs sound as if he recorded them in a dirty gas station bathroom during a fill-up while fleeing from the law for shooting his girlfriend and is now on his way south to meet his maker. Take that however you wish. Good thing? Bad Thing? Whatever. It rocks! Rocks with the kind of drive, passion, desire, and abandon that Elephant completely lacks. It's something I haven't heard in The White Stripes since ""Fell In Love With A Girl."" If the silver lining to Elephant is that it puts a flame under people's asses to try and make something better, to know that they can, then, well, maybe Elephant deserves another star."
1,i just don't get it.,"i tried to like this band. i know, a lot of people say how amazing they are, hyping this ""garage rock"" thing. i bought white blood cells, listened several times, just couldn't bring myself to enjoy it. while i love rougher-sounding bands like nirvana, the stooges, led zeppelin, the buzzocks, i don't find anything really appealing about the white stripes' music, or anything that makes it unique from anyone else's. they just seem to have spin/mtv hype like all the rest of these so called ""garage bands."" i tried again to understand the fuss, and bought the ""elephant"" album a couple of days ago, not expecting much. well, i didn't get much. a lot of their music sounds the same, very course, and while there is some nice guitar work i just can't get into it. i wouldn't recommend them to anyone actually, because i just don't think they're any good. sorry if you disagree, but that's my two cents."
1,TRAINED CHIMP ON DRUMS + TURD-LIKE TOTAL PACKAGE,"This (band?) hit it big this year with all that great rock music they make-even though it's really just donkey fart. A gimmicky record company risk that turned gold. Get your sister-wife-cousin, or whatever a drum set and go bip-boop-bip-boop-crash, or is it, crash-bip-crash-boop-crash-bip-crash-boop.I can't remember.This band gives me a good ol' fashioned Rock & Roll Headache.Also, it just goes to show you, ""you to can be a rock star"", all you have to do is go, crash-bip-crash-boop-crash-bip-crash-boop."
1,I thought payola was illegal?,"I guess you can buy good reviews and magazine covers! This album was not good or original or anything close to classic rock n roll. Take away the high dollar hype and let the youth of today see and hear this band as they really are and let them decide without being brainwashed. I think the reviews I read before purchasing this cd were written by the White Stripes` record company. One thing I will say, in there favor, is they do a good job at trying to masquerade as the Flat Duo Jets. I liked the first White Stripes Cd and if there are people out there looking for the roots of the White Stripes, then they should pick up a Flat Duo Jets CD or better yet, the latest by Dexter Romweber (he was the singer guitar player of the Jets) I heard his new Duo is playing shows with the White Stripes. I would love too see that."
1,MTV music.,"What a disgrace this realy is... Mtv/trl, retards that loves eminem,good charlotte, and others will love this piece of crap but if you enjoy good music? Stay away !"
1,Buy this...if your TONE DEAF.,I can't imagine why anyone would buy this...sounds the same as there last CD. The musicians still can't play and the songs lack any real thought. These two could stand to take some music lessons!
1,Overhyped and unoriginal schlock rock!,"Let's 'give discredit where discredit is due'. The White Stripes are an overrated 4-chord garage band with NO originality whatsoever! The 'youve heard them before' riffs and vocals are rehashed sonics, and have been part and parcel of rock music for decades. The first song is OK, but what follows is one of the worst snoozefests in rock music history. Pass on this one. Unless of course, you're one to fall for overrated trendy bands that have been cleverly marketed to musically stunted fans who fall for anything these days!"
3,A little disappointing.....,"I bought it yesterday and I gave it three spins and while it has that same great guitar and rock style I just don't feel this album is as enjoyable as previous White Strip offerings.While the production and music might be tighter, if find there are less memorable moments in the overall album as opposed to say their White Blood Cells offering.Plus the third song (I believe) has the startings of the exact same riff as Dead Leaves and the Dirty ground. I could be wrong but it gives me a bad feeling when I see rehashing like this.Overall not bad, but not all that great."
3,its ok.. i guess...,"I really like the singles from this album, and so I decided to download some of the other songs. As it turns out, I don't like them at all.I suggest to anyone that is hearing the White Stripes for the first time, to go and do the same. If you like the other songs on the album then go buy it.If you buy the CD because you have heard the singles and you've liked them, I cannot guarantee that you will be at all happy with owning this CD."
2,Really disappointing,"I liked White Blood Cells, but this is mostly a rehash of that record. Jack White is a gifted performer & I highly recommend the band's live show, but on this record it seems that he's reached the end of his creativity, particularly in regard to production. The White Stripes need a real record producer in order to find a new direction."
3,"First listen is great, It becomes tired after that.","I will admit the first time I heard this album it sounded great. Unfortunately the album wears thin with every listen after that. I guess I could attribute this to the fact that this album is based more on gimmicks and over-hype, than it does on creating something that will stand the test of time. In my opinion this whole garage revival is turning into one big cliché. It's just a matter of time before it follows the in the footsteps of Nu-Metal, Grunge, Hairbands, and every other ""movement"" that has placed the genre's rules over it's own originality."
5,One of my favorites,Most of the other reviews have said all that needs to be said. This will go down as one of the best rock albums of all time.
5,Solid album from the king and queen of dirty blues punk,"This is truly a stellar album. When a friend initially recommended it to me I disregarded the suggestion. Frankly I didn't give this band a lot of credit for White Blood Cells(although I find myself enjoying it more and more), I kind of passed them off as another ... garage band. Now I see they are much more talented than those poser[s]... Why? Well for one they get so much out of the sparse instrumentation they use, pumping out great dirty, punky blues. And they are genuine, not a bunch of rich prep school pricks who decided to don leather jackets, tight jeans, and greasy hair just to sell out to all the college scenesters ... This is right up there with Coldplay, Interpol, Wilco, Beck, Idlewild, Blur, and all those other rock critic darlings(justifiably so). Seriously though, buy it, it deserves a place next to your Steve Madden shoes and low cut Diesel jeans you damn scenesters."
2,Well... it's retro- or is it modern?,"Well I was a big fan of the WS before but now the've tried to become retro-cool.In other words they mixed the oldies with a pinch of the shopping mall background music type. Wow, another tomato gone rotten. At least Cobain doesent have to see fantastic and talented people be chained to big companies backyards. The WS were really good at making really good music then adding really edgy lyrics which made a really awesome song. But now they've tried to catch up but only scratched the heel of todays music- which ... beyond all comprehension anyway."
3,Original Punk.. thankfully,"A nice return to 70's punk roots here. I found the vocals good and the lyrics relevant. I listened to Stripes' earlier work and they have morphed a bit here. This is a good mellow punk CD. It is melodic and ranks near Siouxee. BTW - there is one absolute kickin' blues track with Holly Golightly. It doesn't fit anywhere on the CD, but it is just awesome."
4,"WE WANT MORE, MORE, MORE","This is a great cd, and was the first I heard of The White Stripes. After acquiring this cd, I ended up getting everything of theirs I could. This one has songs that rank with their best, but their best cd to me is White Blood Cells. De Stilj is just as good or better musically but partially deals with evil violent themes of the blues, and is too challenging; I'm a puppy, sorry. In 7 Nation Army, the White Stripes dialed towards the center a bit; maybe their handlers are getting to them. They should have gone more nuts, not less. But like I said, some of it is right up there in the rock god hall of fame."
3,"Some cool songs, but it never really clicked with me overall","This one's a step closer to regular blues-based music and not as good as WHITE BLOOD CELLS, although ""Seven Nation Army"" is surely the best song they've done yet. I do appreciate the fact that they shun computers and use only old-school recording equipment even though I tend to like music that pushes technological bounderies.Jack White rocks out quite a bit on ELEPHANT and I wouldn't call him an over-rated guitarist, either. Meg White is a spirited drummer but her vocal contributions just sound like a little girl (and not a very impressive one). ""In The Cold Cold Night"" does nothing for me and the ""we all love each other"" last track may be cute to some, but I just find it annoying.Otherwise, there's definitely some cool songs on this album, but it never really clicked with me. That's why I decided to give it 3 stars. I'm much more likely to reach for WHITE BLOOD CELLS or DE STIJL than this one."
5,I Want My Rock 'n Roll,"When I first heard the White Stripes on the radio a few years back, I wasn't a really big fan. But after the hearing the brilliant single ""Seven Nation Army"", I went and got this album. And am I glad I did.This rock 'n' roll as it was meant to be played. Melodic, smart, funny and most of all, rocking like a mofo. There are fourteen tracks on this record, and all fourteen are well constructed, simple rock songs that beg you to to be played loud on your stereo.Stand out tracks include ""I Want To Be The Warm Your Mothers Heart, ""There's No Home For You Here"", ""The Hardest Button to Button"". But thats not to say that theres a bad song on here, because there isn't.""Elelphant"" is the best rock record I have heard in years, and has even inspired me to get their back catalog(and by God its all pretty good too!). I'm willing tob et that you will really like this record also. VIVA LA ROCK!"
2,not that great,"Everyone needs to quit saying that the white stripes are the best band ever, and that this is the best album ever, and that jack white is the most talented guy ever. this band, this album, and this front man, are not that good. everyone needs to admit that while the white stripes are a breath of fresh air on the radio these days, they are not actually that good. this album is perhaps an average rock album, but not genius by any stretch of the imagination. a lot of the songs sound the same. none of them are really that memorable. honestly. I own this album, if you don't, don't waste your time. buy something better."
4,Things that make you go Hmmmm,"A mixed bag but with the good outweighing the bad by a fair bit. The production, as you'd expect, is a pretty slapdash amd Megs drumming gets wayward here and there but (I'm led to believe) this is part of the charm.It's not much of a step forwards (four albums in and not a lot of change) but if you like it (which I do) then it's good stuff. 'Seven Nation Army' and 'The Hardest Button to Button' are a couple of the best tracks they've done ever, nevermind highlights of the album.If you liked 'White Blood Cells' get this because it's better. If you didn't then leave well alone because it's not a whole lot different."
4,simple and efficient,"I am into 60's and 70's stuff, and usually a bit contemptuous about late music! But this is really good!That's a punk record! Drums are very basic but only made tooffer a perfect counterpoint to Jack's playing and singing! She is the extension for his guitar!Nothing really else to be said! Raw and efficient music, never over the top, keep it to the roots! Jack is talented in his simplicity: a humble record, that I first heard over the last week, because I iniatially refused to listen to them after all the hype around them (yes, even in France!), they never show off and don't disappoint!"
3,Overrated,"Not a bad album, but really nothing great. Some good singles, but very inconsistent as an album. I think over time most of the White Stripes catalogue will fall into the novelty rack - this is at best gutsy and grabbing, but at worst poorly done. Yeah it can be fun, but doesn't go anywhere really. I heard this album was a huge breakthrough for them. I think the opposite. They were a novelty act, who when stepping up to the big time, are revealed for their thinness. I was dissapointed enough to sell it, but don't get me wrong, it ain't all bad, and can be fun if that's what you're into these days."
2,blahhh,"they have the same set of songs over and over again, with the possible exception of Seven Nation Army on this album. If you've heard/purchased White Blood Cells, then you've heard/shouldn't buy this album. this is my opinion."
3,ok,"this is the album that made the white stripes famous. i think its ok, not really my style. i think the hives are a little better."
5,35 Critics Agrree Best Album of the year 2003,This is not a game withe stripes are coming and they gonna take music to a hole new level. Those guys have been able to contracdict the capitalism system and politics in rock n roll by keeping a street cred like no other artist. This record is mixt with guitar and drums sound like you have never heard before. It is an amazing political record ...
1,"White ""Elephant"" Sucks","Bad drumming, below average guitar playing and mediocre amateurish songwriting has somehow taken the music world temporarily by storm. It must be the clothes becaues it certainly isn't the singing. A decade from now folks will look back and ask what were you people thinking? Didn't you have any musical taste?Oh well the dumbing down of America continues..."
1,I don't get it....,"I really think that I may be too old to enjoy this music, but I find it dissonant, boring, and repetitious. I would rather listen to The Clash. The lyrics may be clever, but who cares?"
1,What the hell is this?,"I rented this CD expecting music, the singer is wailing in soprano tones, the drumming is just a simple beat. These guys are the poorest excuse music ever to open for the Rolling Stones, luckily they weren't quite booed off stage. Whoever likes this is just into it because it's something new, not because it sounds good."
1,What Is This?,"After reading all of the reviews praising this group, I had to say something. This is quite possibly the WORST band I have ever heard in life. Jack White can't sing...well I wouldn't even classify it as singing. I'd compare his voice to a rusty bike tire....it's just annoying, plain and simple. And Meg White playing drums, I could make better sounds using bowls in my kitchen. The White Stripes are a disgrace to rock music everywhere. Everytime I see one of their videos played on MTV the same question pops into my head every single time 'Why God? Why?' So unless you are looking for a frisbee then don't buy this garbage, because that's basically all it's good for...garbage just shear garbage."
1,painful,"When I first heard ""White Blood Cells,"" I really didn't care for it that much. I especially couldn't stand the lead single ""Fell In Love With A Girl."" However, after hearing some of the other songs on the CD (""Dead Leaves"" escpecially) the album grew on me and now I like it a lot. So, I desperately wanted to like ""Elephant."" However, I was soon very dissapointed in this effort. The songs are almost painful to listen to. They sound as if elementary school kids got together in a garage and just started playing. I just don't get the ""hype"" surrounding this release. It is so overrated."
1,shocking,"Like another reviewer said, upon first listen, I thought this album was pretty good. Upon second listen: okay. Third: poor.Let's face it, the songs on this album sound very amateur. Especially the folk songs. 'Ball and a Biscuit' gets much praise but I question how many times does the standard for blues songs have to be done, and redone. Meg's drumming is horrid. I will not even mention her singing. Its as bad as Eddie Van Halen's attempt at singing on VHIII. They should be ashamed for trying to sell a song with lyrics such as the one on ""In the Cold Cold Night"". Little Acorn is, perhaps, the worst Black Sabbath song ever. Its as if they said let's spend no time trying to actually write songs - all we need to do is ""sound"" good (and derivative). I don't mind derivative if the songs are good (ie Interpol) but this is just ridiculous. Come on people, you've got to want more from music than this!In other words, this album is tailor made for the MTV crowd."
2,Very Average,I don't quite get all the Hype this Band gets.while it's cool they play there Instruments&wahtnot I don't find much Creative with the way they are hyped to me.the Arrangements are alright at best but the vocals just put me to sleep overall.they have parts here&there that I like but overall I don't feel they are worth all the hype the get.
1,"Elephant Load, More Like It","Posers folks, posers. Not revolutionary. Not even near classic. Rolling Stone lied to you. This is what happens when an elephant eats too many of your peanuts and you are standing behind his backside. Ker-plop. You've been had because you weren't truly feeling the music. And please stop blasphemizing classic rock with comparisons to truly great artists."
5,Proof that rock still lives,"Anyone who has said that rock is dead has not heard this album. I haven't heard an album this part of me since Smashing Pumpkins ""Siamese Dream,"" although the albums are very different. The guitar style is a bit reminiscent of Billy Corrigan in his better days, but this album is less produced, as it should be. The level of production suits their style to a tee. At times the album sounds like it's straight out of the 60's and yet it is still very modern.I definitely agree with many of the reviewers who have rated this album very high."
5,great stuff again,"I really wish I could be more lucid about The White Stripes latest album 'Elephant', but frankly, all that needs to be said is that it is as good as anything they've done previously. In fact it mixes up the styles from previous releases pretty well, Meg gets to sing, and it has a little bit of a darker edge that makes it all the more listenable and yet another great album from a band that keeps getting better."
5,This is how Rock should be,"Words can't really describe how great I feel this album is. It is twice the album that White Blood Cells was and I love that album. If you want a true testament as to how good Elephant is, listen first to Ball and Biscuit. Even the remake of the Burt Bacharach tune is well done. The most amazing thing is to listen to this album and then think of groups most similar to the White Stripes, then realize that the music that comes from the White Stripes is from 2 people and with equipment that is not as advanced as the others. I think that is what I love about this album, it is so throwback to the old days of rock where simplicity was beautiful and hard. Not like today where rock has to have detuned guitars playing at the highest distortion level possible. Thanks, White Stripes for the Best Album of 2003... I'm serious it is going to take a practically perfect album from someone for me to think otherwise!! See for yourself... Enjoy!!!!"
5,Let's have a Ball and Biscuit Sugar and take our sweet little time about it!,Excellent rock and roll. In the cold cold night Meg's vocals are reminiscent of Peggy Lee's Fever. Brave guitar sound. Loud and provocative. I recommend.
1,You're kidding right?,"The White Stripes are supposed to be the next big innovating beast in music right? Well, they may be a beast, but they are not the next big thing, especially in music. This is because they are completely unable to grasp the concept that music is supposed to be nice to listen to. While I know that their sound is not for everyone, it isn't music at all. I have been playing drums and guitar, both for less than a year, and I have more skill than either of them. It's old, it's boring, it's repetitive. They can't expect to pass this off as ""creativity"", because it's just making up for their lack of skill. Skill isn't everything, yes, but please, for the love of all that is sacred, make it stop.WorstBandEver"
1,Better than the others...,"Finally, something that's better then the others. But yet you ask; ""Why give it one star?"" Well, it SUCKS!!! Yes, it SUCKS!!! Those other C.D.'s by this artist SUCK even MORE!!! And I hear Jack White received an award for best guitar from MTV... Clearly, those people are out of their minds, and probably don't know what good guitar sounds like. And, why does Meg always use those cymbals? And, as a bassist/guitarist, I find it somewhat stupid that they don't hire a full-time bassist. It's also a bit ""insulting."""
2,What exactly is this?,"After the hype this album recieved, I figured it had to be pretty good; so I bought it. I was very dissappointed with the quality of this album. None of the songs we're pleasant or interesting to listen to. None of them had real tunes, and I felt like I was listening to five year olds play in a disorganized musical pagent. Most of the songs had no recognizable chorus. I had heard that this album was one a ""cross-generation album"" so I was eagerly anticipating an album that I could listen to with my 13 year old son. The minute I turned it one, my son loved it (he even started playing air gutair), but I had to turn it off before my ears busted. This album is for people who really enjoy heavy rock music...not a curious mother!"
1,EXSQUEEZE ME?,"I have to say this album was absolutely terrible. The drums were more basic than anything I have ever heard, the guitar was fine but not at all good. All in all I dont recomend this extremely bad/basic album."
2,Not Bad. Not Great. Good Opener.,"I not that impressed by this album, with the notable exception of their big hit opener ""Seven Nation Army"". I guess I'm getting older, because I've seen this shtick done before and better: Think G. Love, Jon Spencer, Royal Trux, Boss Hog, Guided by Voices. On top of that, I can't believe anyone would miss the fact that they COMPLETELY and UTTERLY rip off Urge Overkill's ""Positively Bleeding"" on Track 13, with no acknowledgement.This IS a listenable, decent album. The rest of it just isn't as inspired as the opener, and I'VE HEARD IT ALL BEFORE!"
2,More of the same,"No...more of exactly the same. The White Stripes appear to have found their sound on ""De Stijl"" and made the same album over and over again ever since. It's either Led Zeppelin or Paul McCartney with a bit of distorted hipster white boy sings the blues. I thought they'd hit the usual third album rut with the solid but unadventurous ""White Blood Cells"", but this is just more of the damn same. Very disappointing. If you need a White Stripes record then check out the first two releases (God knows that's what the White Stripes are doing)."
3,"Not their best, but still a very notable release -","If you're new to the White Stripes, back the trolley up and start with their first two albums for the most unadulterated Detroit Blues/Rock you can get from Jack and Meg White.While Elephant is a notable entry in their body of work, it certainly isn't the Whites at their peak form. Gone is the sweet school-day lyricism found on De Stijl and White Blood Cells, drowned out by some forced guitar work (but definitely better drum work from Meg). Don't get me wrong, I love this duo and I think they have more staying power than most, but after multiple listenings, I feel just a little let down."
1,I don't think it's me.,"I used to really adore White Stripes. Now, I'm not sure why.This cd is their worst by far. If you you really like their sound, pick up De Stijl instead. It has a top-notch cover of Dylan's, ""One More Cup Of Coffee"".Most of the songs off Elephant are plain-out annoying. I bought this cd the first day it came out... I even went to several stores. I've never been so disappointed in a purchase. Please stay away from this. I don't understand what all of the critics see in this record. I really don't.It's going to the Used shop tomorrow.E-mail me at Christopher_face@yahoo.com if you feel the need to explain what I'm missing in this record."
1,You must be Joking,"Simply put this album BLOWS!! , It's got no flow to it , the songs are awful , boring and monotous and not to mention the low musical abiltity of these two , they make old school punk bands look like ""accomplished "" musicians . Why this band gets so much praise is beyond me , If you want simple music that rocks buy a Ramones , Clash , Sex Pistols or Misfits album , you want Hard Rock , get into Iron Maiden , Megadeath , GNR , Led Zep or any other real good band . This album is seriously like watching you're money burn so unless you like doing that ,stay away from this garbage rock ."
1,Mainstream=Garbage,"Once again mainstream music has proven itself to be complete garbage. The lyrics are simple and dull and the sound is repetitive and boring. Similar, equally untalented, and media hyped bands include the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, The Strokes, Bowling for Soup, and the Hives. If you want real music with real, complex, and thought provoking lyrics check out Thrice, Thursday. Also recommend Senses Fail, Saosin, A Static Lullaby, Rufio, Yellowcard, Brand New, Dogwood, and Funeral For A Friend.Look into drive thru records if you want good pop punk. Just stay away from the White Stripes and clones like them."
