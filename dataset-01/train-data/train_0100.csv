3,Not the Best Adaptation,"I read the book and then decided to purchase the film I thought it was not that bad but the swearing it was over the top. If you want to show this movie to students I'll be cautios there are more than 200 swearing words through out the film. There is an older version of this film, which is black and white, but far better than this one."
3,ummmmm.....hi?,it was good i think. I liked it better than the old version...(I like things in colour:)) But some of the actors over acted.The two main characters were good though! I like Chris Furrh :)
2,not for teachers,"Teachers, if you are looking for a reasonable movie version of the book to show to your students: THIS IS NOT IT. I planned on using it to help my freshman class to understand the book. It doesn't follow the book enough to even remotely resemble it. The plot line is altered and there's language. I suggest you look for another version."
3,Lord of the Flies movie,Decent interpretation of the classic novel. I was happily amazed when my ninth-grade students claimed that they actually preferred the book!
2,You Say Conch... I Say Conk.,"Surely there was no reason for the changes that were made to this screenplay from the book itself - the book is slim / exact / and requires no modification or accomodation. The char. of Piggy is spot-on; Ralph is a bit stiff; Jack is way too young to be Jack; the constant f-this and f-that speeches; and the flight captain coming in on the beach with them from the start was a sure sign that the creator of the film was about to take artistic license - there were no bonus features, but I could imagine one of those smarmy voices: ""It was one of my fave childhood books - wanted to bring it to life on the screen - you know - really do it justice and all that."" Nice try - the only part of the film that really required working to capture was the child-prophet Simon - and to great effect this was done justice until the pivotal moment for Simon which was tweaked and justice to the story undone once again."
4,3 stars out 4,"The Bottom Line:The child acting is sometimes imperfect, but this mainly-faithful adaptation of the novel succeeds more than it fails--by making the relationship between Piggy and Ralph a bit more friendly, it sacrifices a bit of Golding's allegorical vision to make a more compelling narrative."
2,this [stinks],"if anyone has read the book the lord of the flies, and enjoyed it so much they wanted to get this movie version: dont. most of the main important elements in the book have been lost, the boys private school innocense, their disability of not knowing what to do in the situation, even their nationality. beleive me, the book is much better. you dont feel the same impact as when you read the ending to when you watch it, the plot is too watered down, and the gradual build up of evil and fear is not as gradual. this movie is about as far away from the book as you can get, while still being somehow related. if your after an action movie to impress your kid, then it is a good choice, but if your are wanting it to study for an english course (where the book is often used) go with the 1963 version."
2,Lord of the Flie videos,"Not true to the book. Details are in modern times such as the kids missing tv. Theme is correct but the rest is not credible for someone who has read the book. A helicopter rescues the kids in the end, instead of a war ship is just one example. Scenery and costumes are believable. Some of the goriest detalis are left out. OK for younger kids who would not be allowed to read the book."
1,Lord of the Flies,This DVD would not play on DVD machines in the USA. It is the wrong region. It would work in Africa and the Middle East. I was very disappointed and had to send it back.
2,Bad quality,"I was very disapointed by the DVD . I've been actually unable to watch it because it lierally ""froze"" in my DVD player. I contacted Bullmoose music but they never replied. So, very disapointing experience. Thanks to Amazon .ca,my credit card was credited. Thank you Amazon . I will never buy anything again that comes from Bullmoose music. Thanks again Amazon. Andr√©e"
2,Lord of the Flies,"This movie truly disterbed me. I was horrified by it. It was probably a wonderful movie for those who look at the deeper side of it and the symbolism, but I found myself sitting in my history class trying not to cry. Many people probably appreciate this movie. I thought it might be good for me to say how I feel about the movie so I can stop thinking about it. I was bothered by this movie( I know I've said this). When Piggy died my classroom burst out laughing while I fought back tears. I don't recomend this movie to someone sensitive, like me. I saw this movie before I really understould it. In other words, teenagers, read the book first. I don't ever want to see this movie again."
1,A Rip Off,"This movie is so radically different than the book that it's almost fraud to use the same title.Simon, a major character in the book, hardly makes an appearance. Ralph, who gradually turns into a savage in the book, is a troublemaker from the very beginning in this story. They changed the interactions between the characters to the point that hardly anything they do even makes sense; it's just a bunch of random acts of violence by cardboard cut-out characters.It's rated R mostly for language. If listening to ten-year-olds swear floats your boat, then this is the movie for you. If you want the same depth of character and meaning the book has, you're out of luck."
3,Lord of the flies,I think that the book was good But the movie was different from the book. The need to make a new book that is similary to the book
2,uh huh .....,"pretty straight forward and mostly uninteresting . in the novel there is greater detail about each character and more references to the monster . this sint done here and that results in a lack of interest for at least half of the movie which is already short in length . there is some effort made by jack and ralph to make the movie pick up some steam , and when the the kids split up there's some intensity , but it is maliciously marred by dimwitted dialogue ( "" okay dork just asking ! "" )"
3,Good story but very sick and twisted,I thought the storyline was good but when they tortured each other around the fire and killed I found it to be a bit to messed up. They seemed to go from little boys to psycho tribesman.
1,What a complete waste of time!,"A boring 90 minute movie about kids who are stranded on the island acting like their bad or something and they pick on a poor fat kid who gets hit by a huge stoned rock and dies which made me feel so bad for him. What's the point of this movie? Nothing great happens, the acting is not bad but the whole movie just sucks. Sorry but I just don't get the point the movie is just bad don't see it!"
2,Not suitable for children under 13!,"To reply to another user that asked if it was suitable for a 10 year old kid, I would have to say no. Although the characters used in the movie are around that age, the lanuage used will offend you children, aswell as adults. It does not add to the story, and the language is used often.The book on the other hand is very clean, and has no bad words. I would recommend reading your son the book. Not only does it not have bad language, it also covers more information, and has more symbols. The pig's head talking is a major point in the book, and is completely removed from the movie...Hollywood has taken a book written by a Nobel Prize winning author (Sir William Golding), and has beaten it until it was dead. I would recommend you read the book before watching the movie, so that you know what it should really be like."
2,What does this movie have to do with the book?,"This movie has basically almost nothing to do with the book. Half of the script seems to be completely made up. Acting is also nothing to howl about. The only good acting was from a kid who played ""Piggy"".You should stay away from movie as far possible. Read the book, or watch 1963 version of the movie - it's alot better."
1,READ THE BOOK,"You'll get so much for out of it if you read the book, I promise you that. And I also recommend watching the 1963 orginal lord of the flies, the acting is pretty dull, but it's so much better then this one guys!!TRULY READ THE BOOK AND THEN THE 1963 CLASSIC!!!IT'LL BE WORTHLESS JUST TO SEE THIS!!!!!"
1,Read the Book Instead,"A terrible adaptation of Golding's terrifyingly brilliant novel. Misses the entire point, and loses the whole appeal. Skip it."
1,Bad Bad Bad,"This is possibly the worst film adaptation ever.If you would like to see a good version, buy the b&w British edition. It's meaningful and dramatic.This version likes the ""F"" word a lot, confusing, as it never appears in the novel. Also, Simon's dialogue with the Lord of the Flies was a confusing omission."
2,Ultimately unsatisfying,"Of course there is the inevitable comparison to the original b/w film, but even in absence of that, this version just doesn't cut it as an adaptation or re-imagining of the novel.The color photography does not help at all. The Jamaican island scenery is too pretty, given the subject matter and the boys' behavior. Changing the boys from British schoolboys to American military academy brats does nothing for the film.Worst of all, having an adult show up at the end and ask aloud, ""What are you guys doing?"" just provokes unintended laughter besides being unnecessary.Skip this and rent the older version instead."
3,Missing the Mark,"Mr. Stevens does indeed have a deep knowledge of graphics, but less so of Java and, shall we say, the Java 'way.'I have already seen most of the solutions and algorithms put forth here in Mr. Stevens' previous books (C-oriented). They have been somewhat updated to take advantage of Java's graphics capability.If you are looking for a first book to help you begin to understand graphics, fine. This is for you, and Java is probably a good language for that.However, if you are looking to become a better _Java_ graphics programmer, use other sources. Many of the programming idioms here seem like holdovers from procedural programming days."
4,I wouldn't buy this...,"I like Hilary Duff. I'm not as big a fan as I used to be, but I still don't see any reason to hate her and I do still buy her CDs if I like the song.This CD was CD1 of 2 different CDs for the UK release. But I would buy the other Come Clean UK import with the video and remixes instead of this one, which only has 'Come Clean' and 'Why Not'. Any fan who already has the album would see no reason to buy this CD (maybe that's why Hilary got a poor chart position-number 22-for the Come Clean's UK release? That everyone who wanted to already had the album?) for two tracks already found on 'Metamorphosis'. Buy the second Come Clean CD or the Australian import, which has remixes and an interview."
1,ONE STAR,Don't buy this CD and spend your money on something else worth your money. You only get two songs on this anyway. Hilary is the worst singer ever. I bet Hilary thinks she looks punk and goth on the cover. Lyk totalli !~111. No.
5,Perfect,"This book arrived in perfect condition, was very pleased w/the quality and how quickly it arrived. This will make a nice addition to our growing collection of books."
2,"It was ok, nothing special","I guess I had too high of hopes reading hunter thompson. The short stories are ok, but nothing compared to his other works. Move on to the next hunter book if you are getting into his work."
5,ONE OF HER BEST!!!,"This time around Latifah is as hot as ever in terms of lyrical prowess.The fault lays with the music.Side A of this cassette is great but some of the tracks on Side B however are from fair to good.The production was lacking some.This is most evident on the track 12 ""I DON'T KNOW"",where the music is weak and lyrics are good but are way too soft.If the music had been produced to fit the song perfectly[smoother pure r&b backing music],then the results would have been excellent instead of merely good. The excellent tracks are:#'s 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10,and 11.Give this set a chance like I did because you will enjoy it. ALSO, she is working on her new LP. It is supposed to be great. BUY IT when it comes out.SIGNED 17 YEAR OLD MUSIC FAN."
5,ALL THE HAIL THE QUEEN!!,"One of the things that makes Queen Latifah's new albulm so cool is the fact that the image portrayed by the theme of the albulm, which is a complete change from her albulm ""Black Reign"" in 1993, is space-age and surrealistic. She also makes her builds on her singing, with songs like ""Paper"", which gives her an edge over other female rappers. And after 5 years, she's still able to rap and rap well. Can't beat that."
4,Queen Latifah-Order In The Court,"The few rappers still talking about something, Queen Latifah reclaims her throne on Order In The Court. Complete with the ""I Heard it Through The Grapevine"" sampled ""Paper"" and ""Bananas(Who You Gonna Call)""... While this album pretty much went unnoticed, it just proves that hip hop fans just don't have a taste for black reign anymore. We eagerly await a new album."
3,"Good, but not as strong as Black Reign","Order in the Court was good, but it's not as strong as Black Reign. I still like Bananas, which has all kinds of things going on in it. It came at a time when everybody was copying Puff Daddy's beats, that four beat, shake it up style that he did so much. This song is like that, plus it sounds like Run DMC's It's Like That and has a boxing ring bell as a side effect.After that, the album's a mixed bag, some upbeat songs and a few dull songs. It's a little too R&B; for her and not enough hip-hop. Perhaps her next album will go for a street direction, which she's so great at."
1,Don't waste your time and electricity.,"Maybe, just maybe, this could have been a good movie in the right hands.Somewhere buried deep was a plot.The dialogue was cheesy and the acting was amateurish. It was too ""David Lynch""!Not funny enough to be a comedy, and not serious enough to be a drama. And the ending just leaves you hanging. The budget had to be $1.00, which, ironically, was the denomination of the coin he kept flipping. I forced myself to watch it hoping against hope that I could find some redeeming quality, but, alas, I could not.I ended up throwing the tape in the trash.(I didn't even rewind it!) I couldn't bear to inflict this pain on anyone else."
5,DashMat worth the money,This mat fits perfectly. Definately use the velcro that comes with it to secure into place otherwise it will shift around when driving. The dash mat looks nice and keeps the heat from building up in the front window.
5,Microsoft Office Review-8-2-06,"I've only just begun reading this book, but have learned something on each and every page. I bought it at the suggestion of a colleague who attends seminars given by the authors. She raves about their knowledge and ability to easily give instructions on using software applications as they ""write the manuals"", and I can confirm that they ""know their stuff."""
5,A Great Book for Office 2003,This book is a great resource for both people who have used other Office versions and for those who are beginners. The explanations are great and the pictures really help you understand what is going on. My copy of this book has been borrowed numerous times by others in my office. They love the book just as much as I do.
2,Overview book,"I was looking for an in-depth, skill-development book and this isn't it. It gives an overview of Office Professional, but doesn't cover the ins and outs of the various programs."
3,In Business you cannot afford to write a page when a single sentence will do,"I found this book, quite straight to the point in some cases, removing the lard factor from my words have worked in some cases and in some I have not had enough examples to utilise what I have learned from the book. If you are really bad at reducing and writing succinctly then this book is a must. I do not mean what we are taught in School, but how to write in the business world which is very different for what we are feed in School. Words like ""that is"" this book teaches you how to avoid them, writing in bullet point is not a gift we are born with, it has to be taught/learned this book is an aid to that."
4,Very good but very thin,"I have the 4th edition of this book, which is about 50 pages less than the 5th edition. The first two chapters and the appendix are excellent. The rest of the book is very repetitive, although periodically interesting. The author offers unique advice. I now wish I had ordered the 5th edition to see if the other 50 pages contains new information.I have received but not started his ""Analyzing Prose"" book, which is very substantial and appears to contain similar material.John DunbarSugar Land, TX"
3,"some good points, some not that great","This text book is very comprehensive and updated (particularly regarding the chapters on genetics and multiculturalism). However, as an introductory text, it contains too much information in too many chapters, often on an intermediate level."
1,Not happy with this one,"The ""like new"" copy of the textbook I received had lots of highlighting and much marginalia. That was disappointing enough but I received the book in very poor condition - corner smashed in and pages rumpled and compressed together so they were very difficult to disengage and flatten out to turn and actually READ. Cover ripped. Poor packaging for such a heafty but pliable tome. The discount (about $40) wasn't worth getting a brand new one."
5,Easy and quiet,"I had never used a sewing machine before, and decided to try this model. The directions are so simple (there are step by step Pictures of threading and making a bobbin)and all the extra stuff is in this little box on the front of the machine. It comes with a piece of fabric with the different stiches demonstrated, which was a big help. It is easy to carry and not near as loud as I expected. You will be sent three free patterens of your choice as well. I am pleased with mine and would reccomend it for a beginer or experenced sewer (everyone need something easy!)"
5,EXCELLENT Guide for College Students,"This book has carried me through 4 years of H.S. and now will assist me in college. This is highly recommended for ANY person, student or not!"
4,Writers Inc.,Is is exactly what we wanted and needed for our son. It has already paid for it's self.
3,For students who already know the rules,"I bought this book for my younger daughters, and did not find it to be very helpful. The information is very condensed. You would need to know the rules or basic guidelines already to be able to use this. It definitely is not for beginners."
3,Writers Inc: A Student Handbook for Writing and Learning,I returned this book within a week of receiving it (my daughter did not need it for her class). I was charged a 50% restocking fee and for a shipping label that I did not use.
4,Ten Years - Still Going Strong,"The editorial review notes: This book is good for High School Students. This is true. I started with the 1989 edition, which I purchased during high school. Now and then, (ten years later) as a Supervisor, I refer to Writers INC. when I write business and personal reviews. It is an excellent reference/guide to creating efficient and well thought out reviews, papers. I look forward to reading and referencing the newest version!"
5,Not just for High School and beyond!,"We are using Writers Inc in homeschooling our 10 and 12 year olds. It provides clear, concise explanations of grammar that even 4th graders can understand. We've used it for teaching sentence construction, grammar, speech, and book report and research paper writing. It has sections on just about everything relating to communication at all levels. There are even many unexpected resources including conversion charts, maps, a calendar and much more. An extremely valuable resource!"
5,a superb collection....,"If you like quirky, ethereal, down-to-earth, Beatlesque, British pop music (read my ""Millionaires"" review) then you'll love James. I knew I had to get this disc especially for ""Sit Down"" (their best track EVER). If you're into James only because of ""Laid"" (I don't even have that one - yet!), then you better treat yourself to this disc. There's more to them than ""Laid"" and it shows! Every track on this CD is marvelous in its own way (including the four from ""Laid""). And after you get this CD, get ""Seven"" (which I consider to be their best one yet!)."
3,Story is okay,"The overall plot is pretty interesting; the problem lies with the execution of the story. I found that the protagonist's adventures/missions too simple and sometimes laughable. (For example, an arms dealer ask a kid to steal something important for him.) Another thing is that this novel lacks momentum. What I mean is that it doesn't have enough suspence and tension to drive the reader to read on. There is also not enough descriptions on the characters' emotions. I can't really connect with the characters at all."
2,Excellent Idea But These Are Garbage,"I bought these as spice holders, even after reading some of the bad reviews. I just thought they were such a neat idea. Well, when I received them, I thought they were very cute and would work well for me. I put them in the dishwasher. When they came out, the flimsy piece of plastic that makes the lid had fallen out of three of the six that I bought. The ones that didn't fall out were full of rusty water that got in between the plastic and the metal. Yuck. For what they are charging for these, they could be of better quality. Please don't buy these if you plan to use them for foodstuff."
5,TRACY AT HIS BEST EVER,"I had some trouble finding this CD in the stores, but it was well worth the wait. This has to be Tracy's best CD's ever. If you buy this CD and just listen to the ballad ""Before I Die"" you will be completley satisfied with this song alone. This is one of the most beatiful songs I have ever heard. The music and especially the words are incredible. There is no doubt this should have been the first single off the CD. Radio would have grabbed this one and it would have been a great crossover song. The rest of the songs are just as good. You won't be disappointed with this CD.....I promise"
5,The best CD Tracy has recorded,I love every song on this CD. Saltwater Cowboy was the first song I heard off the CD and I knew I had to purchase the CD for that one song. When I listened to the entire CD I was blown away. I have always enjoyed Tracy's music but this one particular CD is awesome. I am not sure what is different about this CD but I hope Tracy keeps up the great work.
2,It's not THAT great,"This album didn't impress me much. I think that that people that gave it five-star reviews because they were just really surprised that these hot Swedish babes could actually sing and play music. I found most of the music to be monotonous and boring, and the vocals were derived straight from Alice In Chains. Enjoy the album if you will, but I need more than good looking women (and they are) for music that I enjoy."
5,KICK *** ALBUM!!!!,I think that this album really showed that heavy music and metal is not limited to only men. Its really awesome to see women playing music that isnt soft and weak. Its really great to see women playing heavy metal. I totally reccommend this album to anyone whom is a fan of metal. This shows that metal is still alive. RIGHT ON!!!
5,Power Feminine,"Fantastic like them they got to mix a vocal one melodic to the Metal, better album of feminine Metal of all the times."
4,Metal that rocks from hott babes! What more do you want?,"Drain is a metal band I think from sweden, that put together a hell of a record here. Very heavy guitar. Think of alice in chains with a great female metal singer. But a warning if you are expecting vixen, this ain't it! In my opinion some of the songs are too heavy and not melodic enough, but still a great record. Unreal is the best one here, but check out the cover of ace of spades. the 2nd record you can do without, which maybe the reason they broke up, but check this one out!"
5,My kids got better in a few days!,I love this stuff because it works great for my kids and now when ever they are sick I will use this :)
3,Picture is MISLEADING!,"Ordered LC Decongestant+Cough (Blue Label) got LC Decongestant Drops (Orange Label). Will use it anyways with my 5 and 8 y.o., but this is not i was expected."
3,"Works, but doesn't work great!","I was a little upset because I purchased this product for my 4 month old who's been having congestion problems and assumed because of the baby on the front it was for infants as well as the ""Little noses saline is."" You can only use it on kids aged 2 on up. . ."
2,not what i was after,"After listening to this one time I put it back into its case and packed it away. I was looking for big band music, no words... just the good old fashioned big band swing type music. If thats what you want, do not buy this!"
4,Debbie at her peak,"I remembered seeing this in the theater when it first came out and enjoying it. I still enjoy it but see it through more mature eyes now so I see that it is not quite as good as I remembered.It could have used some tighter editing and in places Debbie goes way overboard but it still has some wonderful scenes, great music and dancing and a heart warming story behind it.I had almost forgot about Harve Presnell's singing, I was used to seeing him only as an actor in his later years (he was Ms Parkers father on The Pretender series) but it was nice to be reminded of his great voice.I'm sure most people will enjoy this film"
3,Dated Acting,"I confess I expected the dated acting. I was right. The story is also quite dated. However, it was somewhat fun."
3,Debbie was Great!!!,"I loved the play and was delighted to see Ms. Reynolds in the role of Molly Brown. This seems like a part that would suit her well, as it did. Additionally, the authors created a much better tie between Mr and Mrs Brown in the transfer from Play to Movie. My problem is that while Meredeth Wilson wrote numerous terrific songs for the play, only five of them made it to the movie. Many songs, because of script changes, were not appropriate to the story, but even with the changes, many were and should have remained in the film. Also, could they have transposed ""Belly Up to the Bar"" into a key where Debbie Reynolds didn't have to scream it. I realize that she was enthusiastic, but I don't think she could hit all of the notes, so she yelled a lot of it. Kinda irritating."
4,Unsinkable Molly Brown,Very nice. Thank you. The tape played nicely and was clear. The case is a little rippled. All in all - good shape.
1,"Boring, with mediocre music","I'm the only one here who thought this was a big bore - even the music wasn't much, I thought. One very good dance number, though. One of my film books says ""it does drag a bit."" It drags a lot. Glad I saw it on TV.(I do like musicals, but this was tedious.)"
5,dvd,I am truly enjoying this dvd. The price was perfect and I am sure I will order more dvd's. The order came promptly and I began watching it right away and will enjoy watching more times.
3,Out of print and too expensive,"I purchased this from one of Amazon's associate retailers and it was as described: brand new and remastered. I have listened to several of the tracks and they sound clean and are typical of the soundtrack recordings from that era. I'm also a big fan of this musical as well as the movie and I really wanted this soundtrack to add to my collection, even though it was greatly over-priced. I can appreciate that it's out of print and I have no idea from what source the seller obtained it, but I feel that it was priced in this way just because copies were rare, so why not ""jack up"" the price? This CD probably retailed new when it was released for around $16.00 and that's really all it's worth."
3,The Unsinkable Molly Brown,"I had just seen Debbie Reynolds and she brought back memories of her movie, The Unsinkable Molly Brown, so decided to get the movie through Amazon.com. Unfortunately, during a portion of the movie, it stopped, but I was able to get it going again without any further interruptions. Brought back some great memories."
5,Quick Delivery,"Originally, a difficult DVD to find, but as usual, Amazon had it. The DVD was brand new and worked perfectly. It arrived on time."
3,"Good, But Not Great","First let me say that I am a great fan of Meredith Wilson's ""The Music Man"" so I know that he can write some good stuff. Unfortunately I found ""Molly Brown"" to be enjoyable but not terrific. Debbie Reynolds is, as always, sparkling and does a great job with what she's got. Harvey Presnell, in his first role, is also good. The story of Molly Brown is interesting. Unfortunately, with the exception of a couple of songs, the music does not support the story."
5,Great Service,Service was excellent. I received product only a few days after purchasing it. Reasonable price for a new (older) movie. My daughter loves this movie!
1,Horrible,"Whose idea was it to reduce Debbie Reynolds, who has a fine singing voice, to a screeching wreck? When she's not screeching, she's blubbering or strutting around as a two-legged caricature of false bravado. And she's a bit long in the tooth to be playing an urchin, as she does in the beginning of this movie. The choreography in this movie is unimaginative and lame, the characters are stereotypes, and Debbie Reynold's talents - on wonderful display in movies like Singing in the Rain - are totally wasted here. I saw this movie when I was a lot younger and don't recall liking it a lot, but I sat through it (saw it with my parents at a theater, so that's one reason why). This time around, I couldn't even get through it. I love musicals, but this one's a dud."
4,"Good, innocent family entertainment","Debbie Reynolds got better as the movie progressed and it was worth the purchase. We didn't think her male counterpart was as good as he could have been, but all in all a fun family film."
5,Exceptional thriller,Private Entity was an outstanding story that kept me glued to the edge of my seat. I literally could not put this book down. The international intrigue and conspiracies of the plot add to the excitement. The twists and turns of the different story lines come together to make this plot and its fascinating characters into an electrifying thriller that kept me guessing right up until the very end. This first novel by Derderian is extremely well-written and one I highly recommend.
5,Great Speakers - Big Sound; Clear and Beautiful,"Love these speakers.To bad they don't make them anymore!I have the set of ""studio series"" matching speakers, and love the look as well as the sound.These are very efficient speakers, and bring out everything.I especially enjoy them for music, but they are also incomparable for heart-pounding movie scenes when paired with the center channel studio series speaker!No complaints - they are solid enough that you could put a vase on them and crank ""The Doors"" / Zepplin and no worries about is shaking and falling off!"
5,Another Awesome Song,"Where`s the Love is just an amazing song As well as Where`s the Love, it also has live versions of Madeline and Man From Milwaukee which are really cool! Buy it and see for yourself!"
5,This is deffinatly a show of pure talent,The music on this cd is genuenly great. It's amazing talent for boys of their age. Everyone hanson luver or not has to get this cd
5,Cool Cd,"Hanson's ""Where's the love"" single is one of their best songs from their album ""Middle Of Nowhere"". It has a cool beat and the remixes are great as well. This is definately my favourite Hanson song and I recommend it to anyone."
5,HANSON ROCKS!!!!!!!!,I think that itz the BEST and i think that it is cool that amazon has the imported CD single to buy cuz in the united states you can't get the CD single thatz why i'm going to buy it right NOW see ya! ITZ THE BEST!!!!!!!
4,Very informative,"I actually bought this book while I was visiting the region. I found it good reading with a lot of information about the ""Red Terror"" period of which we heard relatively little in Europe. It is obvious the author is not a professional writer, but her involvement make up for the lack of stylistic sophistication."
5,amazing book really helped my son,I bought this book to my son's therapist who loved it. She read it to him over a few weeks... it does not use the title ADD in the book and leaves a lot of place for kids to solve their own problems and how to express them self. A great therapeutic tool... I plan to review it with him every so often it was a great buy...
2,disappointing,"While I did think the child-friendly checklists were generally a good idea, I found myself wanting to edit them. The questions were ""leading questions"", not open-ended. The checklists lead to a negative sense of self (i.e. ""ADD is Bad""), no positive outcome possible.A side note, ""school"" and ""homework"" are an integral part of the book. We homeschool, so this additional point made the book unuseable for our family."
4,Leonard Hatch and Doris Mae are unforgettable,"Told simply and eloquently, ""Welcome to Xanadu"" held the power to be a touchstone book for a lot of people. Uneducated farm girl is kidnapped by an escaped (but non-violent) mental patient and is forced to examine her life in a new way. She ends up sharing a mountain cabin with the strange, poetry-spouting man and comes to understand him. Benchley layers the story with flashbacks, which are curious if not especially necessary, yet his dialogue is keen and he makes these characters reachable and funny. Made into a first-rate 1975 telefilm (""Sweet Hostage""), Hollywood of course added a romantic subtext which you won't get here. Still, the even-handed way the novel plays out, and Benchley's talent with everyday talk, reaches the viewer in a warm and real way."
4,"Enjoy the movie, not the format","I have always enjoyed Burt Reynolds movies and ""Gator"" is no exception. Oh sure, don't expect any of Burt's offerings to be placed in nomination for any awards, but they are extremely entertaining and always action oriented.I'm however saddened that the powers-to-be have again chosen to put yet another Burt Reynolds DVD movie out in that dreaded ""full screen"" format. I just don't understand the rational for some of his best movies like ""Sharky's Machine"" and ""Hooper"" and now ""Gator"" to be released like this. To me, it is akin to buying a ""Rolls Royce"" with a VW engine.You will thoroughly enjoy the movie if don't have any preference as to it's format, but I will never again knowingly purchase a DVD in full screen format when it should be in it's theatrically released format, because for me, that is one of the important reasons I am buying DVD's in the first place."
5,Ya Can't Beat Burt....,"Another classic bit of Burt...I prefer seeing Mr. Reynolds in this type role. With that sly Burt attitude and wit, always gettin' the bad guy and winnin' the girl in the end. It's a simple script, nothin' fancy, just Burt doin' what he does best!! These movies are my little guilty pleasures. I love this flick, no 2 ways about it! I really prefer Burt in this type of movie, or the Bandit role, or the Cannonball Run role...well, you get where I'm comin' from...just good old fashioned simple entertainment!!"
1,another INSULT from MGM ....full screen? this sucks!,"I love the two GATOR movies...saw them when I was a testosterone filled high schooler and Burt Reynolds was THE action star of my day....but these DVDs ""White Lightning"" and ""Gator"" have been transformed from 2:35 aspect ratio...WIDE widescreen to 1:33...thus chopping the heck out of them..watch the credits chapter on GATOR to see how the film should be shown..DOES MGM think that only dumb old geezers who don't understand film formats would watch these? WHY the dumbed down versions..I'm ordering overseas where they RESPECT the films"
4,Reed is riveting!,"While the character of Gator is somewhat softened by his being in love and being a father, the action that made ""White Lightning"" a hit is evident in ""Gator."" Perhaps the best aspect of the film is Jerry Reed's credible portrayal of a villan (it is hard to believe that he is primarily a country singer). As someone said (Hitchcock?), "" a film is only as good as its villan."" If you like ""White Lightning,"" then Gator is a must-see."
1,Zero stars for square screen not widescreen anamorphic,"dont buy this square screen garbage, trash, crap, wait for the blu-ray it will most likely be widescreen anamorphic! and just as cheaply priced."
1,cut up TV version,"This was a favorite of mine, I don't know if the original version is lost or if it was cut up for TV and that is all that is left but it is not as I remember it from seeing it on HBO in the seventies. No widescreen sucks too. Please release the original in Widescreen. on the plus side Lauren Hutton is hottttttttttttt!!!"
4,Gator,"I saw this movie in the theater when it first came out. I loved it then and I still do. From start to finish it is thoroughly entertaining and has an excellent soundtrack. The plot may be tried and old and stale to some, but it is done so well and the film is packed with wonderful character actors like Jack Weston and Alice Ghostly....it is simply a good time."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!,There is a plastic ring that holds this lounge in shape. As soon as I tried to use this lounge the plastic ring snapped. I'm 5' 11'' and 175 pounds. When I climbed onto the float both sides broke. I was not mis-using it. BAD PRODUCT at any price
3,Good introduction but not well structured,"This book provides an easy to read introduction in reinforcement learning. It covers several approaches (dynamic programming, monte carlo, temproal differnce) and gives a lot of examples.However, in my opinion it is neither well structured nor written. The book has no clear separation between theory and examples given to demonstrate the applications of the theory. Due to this, the theoretical ideas are blured instead of clearified. After going through the examples it is always possible to find out how it work, but this should not be necessary.After reading this book you will definetely know the basics (even more) about reinforcement learning. However, I somehow expected more because of the names of the authors. Perhaps this is not only a problem of this book but of the field of reinforcement learning itself."
4,Great! Top just a little wobbly,"I didn't have enough room on my new sink for a soap dispenser so I bought this. It's pretty pricey for what it is, but it's also really pretty and well made. The body of the dispenser pops right out so you can fill it easily and installation was pretty simple. The top is just a little bit wobbly but I'm thinking it'll be better once I adjust the way it's screwed in."
3,Just show me the GD monster already!,"Folks visit a small, once inhabited town and seek answers regarding it's now missing populace. Creepiness abounds through a suspenseful build-up. If you're looking for an entertaining bit of horror and suspense, ""Phantoms"" may do the trick for you. Decent special effects and acting enhance an ""ok"" script. Perhaps the story seems a little congested due to time constraints of a feature length film. You'll certainly have new imagery to go along with Patsy Cline's ""I Go To Pieces"" when you're done. Fun"
1,It's a ball of confusion,"I have no complain about the actors. They do their parts pretty well. At first, it was interesting a scary. Then I got more confused not knowing what the story is all about. Is this supposed to be a ghost story? a maniac on the loose? the devil itself or a big invisible monster? I appreciate fictions and like the abnormal. But the logic has to be there, it's got to make some sense. I mean, a monsterous God being afraid of a bacteria is too much to handle. I can't believe they still waste the actors' talents on scripts like this. A good scary movie should keep you scared at least until the next day."
1,Foolish waste of a good actor.,"I found this movie very hard to follow. I couldn't tell if it were a horror movie, a monster movie or a bunch of wild hallucinations. The plot did not flow smoothly and at the end I was still left with the question of ""What the heck happened?"""
1,a bad movie,It was one of the most unscarey movies I seen in a long time. The acting was poor as well as the lame plot. I was robbed an hour and a half of my life as well as $3.00 for this movie if you can even call it that.
5,so creepy that i almost turned it off,it was a scary movie especially the first 20 mins or so. i was wondering if id make it through the movie w/o a heart condition. but then the movie turns less creepy once u find out what these people are up against. its one of the best movies ive seen in a while. i enjoyed it just as much as i enjoyed alien resurecction
3,Phantoms review,"Its a solid B sci fi/ horror movie, very enjoyable. Decent plot, good pace and a good creep factor. I would say its a good buy. Its a great way to kill a afternoon if you just cant find anything to watch on TV."
2,Don't Waste your $,"This is one of the worst and most unwatchable movies I have ever seen-right up there with Battlefield Earth and I Dreamed of Africa. I picked this up at Blockbuster, stupidly paying money for a rental and just could not make myself watch the whole thing. I am a cheapskate and I never do this. It's playing on the WB right now as the requisite bad sunday afternoon movie.I'll just ask the obvious and say what the #&!! was Peter O'Toole doing in this? Perhaps this past sin is why he was shut out at the Oscars this year.When will I learn? Every Dean Koontz movie I've tried to watch is awful-interesting premise but really really predictable and intellegence insulting plot and dialogue. You can't really blame the actors, they do the best with what is clearly excremental scripting and directing. Even more pitiful and disappointing than Steven King movies."
3,"GOOD START, BAD ENDING","This movie starts great.It's very original and frightening.Then, after one of the police men die, it starts to be a little stupid.After the middle, when strange creatures appears it's very stupid.And the ending, could be better."
1,I read the book and wish it would of stayed that way!,"I think Dean Knootz is a very fun author to read. I picked up this book because a friend said it was good. The book was good, but not Knootzs best. I rented the movie because I wanted to see how much the book and movie differ. Well, to say it in a nice way - Read the book. The movie is all over the place. I know that they had a budget and had to fit the whole story in less than two hours, but then WHY make the movie. So much is missing about what exactly the Phantoms are and the ending in the book much better. WHY? WHY? WHY? I just can't understand WHY this movie was made in the first place. It should have been a TV miniseries. At least then you can actually make it longer then two hours and people will actually understand what the hell is going on. The book was very suspenseful at times; the movie was a big bore!"
3,Good Adaptation,"I think this is a good adaptation of Dean Koontz's book. As for scary, anyone that thinks ""The Village"", ""Final Destination"", ""I Saw What You Did Last Summer"", or ""Blair Witch Project"" are scary but think that ""Phantoms"" is bad, you just don't have a clue. The suspense slowly builds with no clear goal of how to destroy the creature. Excellent music helps build the suspense. If anything is lacking in the movie, it is the creature.The creature is not quite as good as it could have been with a larger budget. My guess is they didn't want to spend alot of money on CGI. It is still well done and the acting is definitely good. The directing, camera work, and sets are good too. The camera work reminded me of some of Hitchcock's work. All-in-all certainly worth more than the five dollars and ninety-nine cents I paid for the DVD."
3,Based on a Dean Koontz novel,"I read the book before seeing the movie, thankfully. The movie isn't that bad. It din't win any Oscars but it had a great cast and an intresting storyline, including a classic part where a giant butterfly eats a man's face. CBS-TV thought it was ""A Chillingly Original Thriller!"" but all in all, you should just see this if you're a horror movie fan or a Dean Koontz fan."
3,not likely to give you any nightmares,"First let me say that I am a big fan of Dean Kootz (even if his latest work has been a bit lacking. Unfortunately his books don't tend to make good movies. Phantoms is classic Kootnz. A whole town disappears over night....and that is where the fun begins. The start of the movie is done very well, suspense is good, the mood is creepy. Unfortunately it kind of goes down hill from there. Liev Schreiber can barely act and he definitely brings down the movie. Unfortunately the movie is simply too short to do the book justice. They try to stay true to the concept of the creature of the book and for that we should be thankful. It is certainly not the worest Kootnz Book-to-Movie conversion and it isn't a horrible movie just disappointing. If you have the time then read the book, if you want a general idea of the story though the movie will do."
2,ok story have seen better from the movie's stars,"this movie is ok for special effects.then it gradually turns into a horror movie.All of the stars have been in better movies (like affeck,armeggedon, the guy from the scream and ransom, mcgowan jawbreaker, etc..) also where is the trailer i have come to expect from disney ( after all it is a disney movie ) it just does not say it!!!a civil action is a much better dvd from the same studio as either dvd of the scream movie. This dvd is a ok for a rainy day or if you have some time to kill!!OK special effects!!Pathetic story!!"
1,THE WORST MOVIE I EVER SAW,This movie is a waste of space. A very poor and unscarey plot.The acting is laughable.Every single actor in this movie is a sell-out for doing this junk. At the 45min mark I stopped seeing it.Only see this movie if you have a choice between an Ed Wood movie or this. I could be more harsh on this movie if I wanted to but it is not even worth the time.
4,Shut Up Complainers!,"Phantoms is a horror film that harkens back to old hitchcock films. Why it is getting bad reviews for using suspense rather than gore to scare people is beyond me, I went in to this expecting a turkey like Scream, but boy was I surprised. While the effect wore off a minute after it was done, that is understandable for me, because the only movie that stayed with me for months was The Exorcist. Phantoms is a high quaility horror/thriller film that shouldn't be missed. It looks as though the previous reviewers either didn't get it, or saw the wrong movie. This is definately one that'll scare you, but don't go in expecting The Exorcist."
2,No Subtitles for Hard-of-Hearing,"This DVD is a great bargain unless you are hard of hearing; then it's no deal at all. There are no subtitles or any other on-screen options in this bare-bones version DVD release. No previews, no sound or viewing option menus, and of course no subtitle selections; just ""PLAY"" and ""CHAPTERS"". The video quality of the DVD is perfectly acceptable and the sound seems OK (I'm not a good judge) but without subtitles for the hard-of-hearing I miss out on most of the dialogue, especially where the Ancient Enemy is talking in a highly modulated voice.The movie itself is highly entertaining. Not perfect but what film is, and it is very reminiscent of John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" - probably the best science fiction-suspense movie ever made.If you have perfectly good hearing then buy this DVD. If you're someone like me who's too cheap to buy a hearing aid, get the earlier 1998 release."
3,Black Sludge From Hell...,"I've never been a huge Dean Koontz fan. So, I didn't expect much from this movie adaptation of PHANTOMS. What I saw wasn't a complete disaster, but not all that frightening either. Of course, having Ben Affleck play a small town sheriff does stretch believability to the breaking point! Rose McGowan (DEVIL IN THE FLESH) gets to scream and look scared a lot, and Peter O'Toole has certainly come quite far from his LAWRENCE OF ARABIA days, now playing a gossip-rag reporter battling an oil-sludge monster. As for the creature, it's not bad, although I was constantly reminded of THE THING. All in all, PHANTOMS is a good way to kill (murder) 90 minutes..."
2,"THE BLOB, THE FOG, THE SHINNING, THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN...","Is all of these movies put together. The first 20 minutes are good in getting our attention, but later when we kind of get the feeling the ""phantoms"" are not what we thought they were, the movie loses momentum. This film borrows freely from The Blob- the underground scene- and The Shinning- the somber kid that appears out of nowhere- The Thing- the exploding dog- The Fog- the group of dead people appearing suddenly- The Andromeda Strain- the desolated town- The Howling- scene where a character re-appears at a bar- and we could go on for hours... Is not a good movie for people who have seen many other horror films. The younger generation may get a kick of the boo! scenes, but that all."
2,it could use lots of improvement,"it was not that scary i ohhed or ahhed a couple of times but thats it ,but the cast was wonderful."
2,And I thought Stephen King movies sucked!,"How such a truly great and creepy horror novel got turned into this p.o.s. movie I'll never know. The first 10 minutes of the movie is very close to the book, but after that takes a huge dump. There is so much story and charcter development left out the movie that I don't know how anyone could really understand or follow it. The ""monster"" was timid at best compared to the book. Ben Affeck? Who the hell cast him? I love Deans book, but even he probably had a stroke after viewing this turkey. 2 stars for at least being mildly entertaining."
1,Why oh why Ben and Liev?,"How do they get awesome and talented stars such as Ben Affleck and Liev Schreiber into movies like this? I'll admit that I watched it because these two actors were in it. They did admirably well with what little they were given. Definetely not one of the best movies I have ever seen. However, there is a really funny part where Schreiber sings ""I fall to pieces"" by Patsy Cline that makes up for the rental or purchase price."
1,Horrible,"What a bad movie. I read the book over the summer so I figured I'd check the movie out. While the book wasn't GREAT, it was pretty interesting, unforunatley something the movie isn't. It leaves out at least HALF of the main characters that made up the book. The characters it does keep are terribly cast and act almost the complete opposite way they do in the book. I don't understand why they chose to change around a perfectly acceptable story so much until they made this mess, but they would have been better off saving there money and you will be too by reading the book instead of watching this."
2,A let down after the book...,"Standing on its own, this movie was pretty bad - poor acting, poor script, silly special effects, etc. However, when compared with the excellent Koontz book it's based on, the movie's dismal quality really stands out. It's as if they took out everything good about the book and threw in some silliness to compensate.To sum up the movie in one word: terrible. Please do your self a favor and buy the book instead!"
5,Riveting horror film well worth watching!,"Gosh, if you're a Koontz fan you've gotta see this movie. Whomever thinks his material is not good for films is nuts. He has great twists and riveting characters throughout. This movie jumps right into the suspense as two sisters pull into a silent snowy mid-west town. From the minute they step out of their car the eerie atmosphere sinks in, and it doesn't quit until the film is over. If you want hair-raising fear, shadows, creepy sounds, and a plot-line that requires a little thought then this movie is right up your alley. It's good old-fashioned scary fun with some truly great acting and terror around every corner. There are even some awesome special effects, a little splatter matter, a few buckets of blood, and some clever hybrid creature creations to add to the fun. I had a blast watching this film for the first time."
3,Middle of the road monster movie.,"One thing the film adaptation of Dean Koontz's Phantoms shows is the origins of some of the plot concepts in Chuck Russell's high octane remake of The Blob. Quite frankly the borrowed ideas worked better in The Blob than they do in Phantoms because Koontz's script is so underdeveloped and over simplified, strange considering the rich and textured fast moving plots Koontz grinds out on an almost daily basis.The residents of a small town vanish almost instantly and whoever (or whatever) is responsible playfully toys with those who either stumble on the scene or have come to investigate. Peter O' Toole plays his role with resigned fatigue, Ben Afflek is far too young for his part, and guess what happens to the token black guy and other minority groups hanging around the edges of the cast. Director Joe (Halloween 6) Chappelle crafts an undistinguished monster movie that I found hard to dislike and easy to recommend to the undiscriminating."
2,Not Good,"I read the novel in preparation for seeing the movie, and the novel stank, so I knew the movie probably would, too. But I'm such a Peter O'Toole fan, I went anyway. Well, he was good, but he wasn't in the movie that much. It was the first time I'd seen Rose McGowan, and I was impressed with her screen presence. But Everyone else, and everything else in this movie stank. It you're in the mood for B-movie junk, this is your ticket. But if you want something good, forget it."
2,poor,"My video clerk described this film perfectly: ""It's a blob movie."" Do blobs scare you? Especially Blobs who purport to be made up of all the evils of the history of the world - who just happen to materialize occasionally as big bat-like creatures that smash through windows? Then, by all means, see this."
2,"""THE BOWIE FAN THAT FELL INTO HER POPCORN""","Don't get me wrong, I love Bowie's sweet face as much as the next guy but, what was he thinkin'? I was really dissapointed. Not with the preformace, but with the story line. I started to see what was going on but, then the credits started to roll by. I think I had more fun looking at the box. I give one star for the effort and one star for the box."
1,No zero star option. sigh,"THIS is an abomination. Convoluted stories strobed about at random, crap acting, poor musical score, AND worst of all, NO resolution to any of the multiple story lines. Go ahead and waste 2 hours of your life if you have more time to live than the rest of us."
3,Too Long - No point - Boring,"Evrything I could say about this movie I said in the Title: The movie is way too long, it is pointless & terribly boring! Even if the actors had been really talented they had nothing much to work with."
4,This is it....but...,"Time for me (and you) to bury the rancid turkey that Fox Lorber issued a few years ago. This is the edition to buy. The film looks fantastic...Anamorphic Widesceen!! Great sound, and a very good movie indeed. My reservations, meaning a docked star, are with the thin smattering of extras, necessitating a second disc, and the flimsy packaging that will fall to pieces if you watch this as compulsively as you ought. These quibbles aside, the price is right, and hats off again to Anchor Bay for taking a punt on this film"
1,Artsy-Fartsy,I must say that I love David Bowie. But this movie is just not worth buying or even watching. It's good if you like Artsy-Farsty movies that just don't make sense.
1,Bad Theatre,It took me a week to watch 1/2 of this movie. I kept falling asleep. I thought it was going to be very cool with a sophisticated science fiction theme and David Bowie. Perhaps I will watch the rest of the movie someday.
4,A Perfect Synopsis Of Bowie's life circa 1974-1976....,"This movie is brilliant most of all for offering Bowie-fans/viewer's a very subtle,clever overview of Bowie's psychological states after years of cocaine abuse following the demise of 'Ziggy'... His acting is very powerful,emotionally-wrought and compelling as hell. It's a wonderful visual counterpart for Bowie fans wishing to make a musical and personal understanding from where 'Diamond Dogs'/'Young Americans'/'Station To Station' led to the 'Low' album... This movie may very well be David Bowie's most-personal,involved and all-encompassing acting role yet. Any naysayers that should say Bowie is a vanity-actor; look no further than at this movie. It's a diary of his times as much as any of his mid-'70's albums. I got the movie the first time I saw it(I'm rather deep that way! :) ). Very good movie: ****"
5,They don't make movies like this much anymore.,"This is one of my all time favourite films. I love movies that make me think, contimplate all of existence. To experience what the characters experience. To remember why it is we are alive."
3,DISAPPOINTING,"I am a science fiction buff of long standing and will go through many length to see the edge of what I feel is to be our ultimate destiny. I say this so you will know how sad and disappointed I was with THE MAN WHO FELL FROM THE SKY. It had such promise that I kept believing that ""any moment"" it was bound to improve. It was a roller coaster ride, stringing the viewer along with high segments that teased and promised more, only be dropped to great depths. Although the acting was worthy of some of the effort, I truly regret that I wasted so much of my Earthtime on this film!"
1,Bowie is the only saving grace,"Imagine ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"", but twice as long, with a less coherent plot, grating music, and even more howlers. It's got assassins wearing matching gold-spangled motorcycle helmets. A university professor who insults his department head with impunity, then happily goes from banging coeds to living in a Quonset hut in the desert with nothing to do. Repeated images of people falling through space, some wearing shiny clothes. And best of all, a girlfriend for the spaceman whose only advantageous attributes are a love of gin and the ability to pick up a grown man; too bad she never learned to call emergency services when someone has a massive, bleeding seizure. I could go on but this movie already sucked 2 1/2 hours of my life away."
3,It is great for the die-hard Bowie fans.,"I did not like this movie at first. I'm only 15, so at first I didn't understand it. I'm David Bowie's biggest fan so I watched it again. The more you watch it, the easier it is to understand.I like it more each time I watch it. I would encourage only Bowie ang Roeg fans to purchase this film."
5,order this one!,"if you haven't bought the original dvd of the man who fell to earth, the wait two months and get this one instead. it's been digitally remastered and includes (according to anchor bay)...The Man Who Fell To Earth - Feature Presentation (Disc One)* Widescreen Presentation enhanced for 16x9 TVs* THX ApprovedThe Man Who Fell To Earth - Bonus Materials (Disc Two)* Theatrical Trailer* TV Spots* Talent Bios* Poster And Still Gallery* Watching The Alien -- An All-New 24 minute featurette* Original Screenplay in DVD-ROMi'm defintely waiting to get my hands on this."
2,"Great movie, bloated price","What is it with Criterion? Yes, we are grateful for the DVD release of classics, obscurities and under appreciated gems but enough with the bloated prices already!!!I can believe that the rules of supply and demand dictate higher prices for Criterion's releases as they will not sell like your average Hollywood blockbuster. And I suppose that a great deal of legal wrangling with estates and the like, not to mention actual film restoration and editing rev up their costs but $56.00 for The Man who fell to Earth?! Come on! Maybe a few less bells and whistles with each film. I could do without a commentary from some film critic or interviews with the director from some Belgian TV program in 1976. Just give us the movies at a more reasonable price."
4,Puberty Blues,"If something to watch this movie for, it is a rare public appearance of David Bowie's manhood.However, is it enough for broadening even the mind only?"
5,Huge Star Wars Fans!!!!,"I got this Darth Vader Cutout for my husbands 40th birthday party. All of our guests got to take pictures with him, and I had them printed at the party. They were very fun to look at for everyone. He comes bent in half, so there will always be a crease across his mid section. He is made of thick cardboard which holds up well if kids arent hitting him with lightsabers! Lightsabers will cause holes in him!"
3,A few ideas..,"I don't have a loft space, but I love to look through photos of them. This book only has about 2 paragraphs of text on each page, telling mostly where the loft is located etc. There is no useful information about how or why certain elements were chosen for the space, or even good descriptions. There are a few nice lofts in here though. Most are residential but there are a few commercial lofts that have been transformed into restaurants and offices. I didn't pay much for this one so I had no regrets, but there are better loft books on the market."
1,Very Flat for 700 Fill Power,This comforter was very flat and all the down slid into the corners of the baffels. It was disapointing enough to return it and I found several better comforters a a local store for slightly less money. Highly recommend against!
2,Down Comforter for Year Round Comfort - 700 Fill Power 600 TC,"I just received this Down Comforter, paid $210.99 for it here on Amazon. It's safe to say the advertised Fill Count is incorrect; the comforter has insufficient Down inside and is very flat actually. I purchased what appeared to be a good deal but I'm pretty sure I received less than I paid for this time as I could have got a better value buying locally."
2,FACTORY SECOND,INSTALATION NIGHTMARE FACTORY DID NOT PRE DRILL HOLES AS THERE DIRECTIONS CLEARLY INDICATE THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN.SO ALOT OF MEASURING REQ AND HAD TO MAKE TEMPLATE.THIS STEP SHOULD ALWAYS BE DONE AT FACTORY TO INSURE PROPER LINE UP TO FRAME OF TRANSPORTER OTHER THAN THAT PRODUCT WAS IN EXCELLENT CONDITION.
4,"A good start, but nothing beats a real class","Lots of companies are putting foreign language materials on the market these days. This is not a bad product among these, either. Its focus on spoken German and everyday German, the kind you need to pick up to get around and deal with people, transportation, bureaucracies, etc., is practical and intelligent. However, don't be mislead by this CD or any other product that claims to simplify language learning: Nothing can ever beat the tried and true flash-card method, nothing can replace spending time a class once a day for a year or two. Better yet, use this CD for a couple weeks before going to LIVE in German-speaking Europe for a couple months. But don't use it to replace any of that. The CD format is a great advance, incidentally, over cassettes, in terms of repeating dialogs and sentences, custom-programming what you hear, etc."
1,Still Horny? Yes..after reading this book!,"This book is just a book mostly on strip clubs, shopping, and night clubs. This book might be good for men who are trying to locate the ultimate strip club, or where to pick up a bimbo, but for anything else...forghettaboutit! I personally bought the book to find out how they rated some of the swinging clubs, but there was only a mention of two. Out of all the swing clubs, underground sex clubs and parties out here in Los angeles...they only mention two. Oh yea..if youre looking for a good spa to get a facial or something, or shopping for sex toys and sexy clothes...its cool! But if youre looking for all the places where you can have some crazy sexual fun in Los Angeles... forgettaboutit! Keep looking!"
3,hilarious and much needed for uptight america,This book kept me in stitches. Written with so much clever humor. I am a straight woman who wants to know about what's up in my fair city. Now I want to grab the husband and hit some of these clubs after reading the guide.
5,Any serious Native American collection needs this reference.,"Any college-level holding strong in Native American history and culture needs the 3-volume reference Treaties With American Indians: it offers an encyclopedia of rights, conflicts and sovereignty and provides the first comprehensive introduction to the agreements pertaining to over 500 tribes of North America, including Alaska, Hawaii and Canada.

4,Great value for basic sewing,"This machine doesn't have lots of fancy stitches but does just what is required for home decorating, & at a good price. It comes with an instructional video. My only complaint -why don't machines come wth a case anymore-it feels flimsy without."
3,caveat lector,"1) independently check all claims. The statement ""In fact, a manifold is Kobayashi hyperbolic if and only if it is biholomorphic to a bounded homogeneous domain,"" on p. 106 is blatantly false.2) this edition has been superseded by the larger (and cheaper on Amazon) ""Encyclopedia of Distances"" published by Springer in 2009 (ISBN: 978-3-642-00233-5)."
1,Don't waste your time or money,This book is very simplistic. I would not recommend it to anyone! You should try the Choosing the Sex of your Baby by Shettles instead.
3,choose sex of your baby--simple version,"This book is extremely basic and a five mintue read, literally. If you are just begining to research this subject, and are looking for the most basic information, this book is for you. But if you are looking for more specific information, or to build on a basic knowledge, I would not recommend it."
1,"Just buy ""Taking Charge of Your Fertility"" instead","If you really want to learn about ovulation charting and shooting for a certain gender this book is too simplistic. Buy ""Taking Charge of Your Fertility"" and truly educate yourself on your cycles. I was so dissappointed in this book that this is the first review I have ever written."
5,Love this CD,"I received this CD as a gift in my early 20s and 25 years later, i am still listening to it. Her rendition of ""I Love you Porgy"" continues to break my heart. The recordings are perfect."
5,Nina and Little Gril Blue,This CD is a copy of a 331/2 rpm album I had years ago. I completely wore the album out and was thrilled to get it now on CD. Nina's compelling voice and choice of songs as well as her skill as a jazz pianist makes for enjoyable listening. I absolutely recommend it.
5,EARLY NINA,HER FIRST AND MAYBE ONE OF HER BEST ALBUMS..I JUST LOVED IT..SHE STARTED OUT AS THE EMPRESS OF SOUL...A MUST HAVE FOR NINA SIMONE COLLECTORS..
3,I need one like it,"I have been advised to be sure this replacement includes the ""prom""part (Equivalent to AC Delco's ALZX 7065).Aparently this part may be damaged an the replacement would not operate or may not match the original AC Delco connections of said part."
4,"A good book, with a predictable plot.","This book tells the story of Noah and Allie. It is set in the early 1930s. They fall in love, but it is forbidden. The rest of the book is pretty predictable, but it is also a quick, fun read. Sparks did a great job with writing the plot, and detailing the characters, but the book was a little to predictable."
4,TOUCHING!!!!,"Yes, it is touching but I did not cry the whole novel like I did with Bridges.. But it's a novel that will stay with me forever . I like the simplicity. fluidity of his style of writing, the bluntness of words used to describe feeling and emotions made the right impact. This is a tale about love that endures a lifetime and I love it."
4,Captures the Heart,"No, this book is not for people who love violence, [physical activity], and fast action. This book is for the tender hearted. It is about loyalty, something sorely lacking in this world today. Loyal-love. Nicholas Sparks has a problem with going on and on sometimes in his books - finish the book, it's already been said! But you excuse that with the Notebook. You really don't want it to end. And you leave the book wishing that there were more such stories in the real world..........To really appreciate this book you should listen to it on tape or CD. The readers do a great job and make it come alive more...like having someone read to you.I loved this book..."
5,We fell in love with this little book!,"Our daughter, an Enlish major and aspiring novelist, gave my wife and I a copy of this book. In turn we both read it quickly with a similar reaction: putting it down with a lump in our throat, a tear in our eye, and remarking to each other what a sad yet delightful story. Sparks is a master at convey human emotions of love, hope, frustration and resignation so they touch the reader without seeming contrived or simplistic"
4,"Very enjoyable, sensitive reading","This book was very sensitive and exact as to the feelings that people have when they loose the deepest love that they have. I lost my husband last year and still mourn his loss because we were so connected emotionally. Not many people experience that true love and cannot appreciate it unless they experience that feeling. The less than complimentary reviews of this book make me believe that they have not experienced that feeling. This book may not be a classic literary find (I have read the Grapes of Wrath, Moby Dick and most of the other classics, but it is worth the time to get to your deeper soul and ability to love someone else unconditionally"
3,The Notebook,"The Notebook by Nicholas Sparks, fantastic book!! I would advise anyone to read it. It starts off in a nursing home, a little strange for a romance story. Then the end of the book returns to the nursing home which explains it all. This is the story of a man and woman who experience something so powerful, so real they never forget it. All throughout their daily lives they looked for that certain aspect in every individual they dated, but sadly they could not find it. Until one day Allie spots where Noah is and she heads off in his direction. They meet and sparks fly. Who does Allie chose? her fianc√© or her one true love. You'll have to read and see!! Great book!"
2,"Amuzed, I think not","This book is one of Nicholas Sparks' worst to this date. I can't understand how anyone could like this thin story line? I normally enjoy his work, but this was a disappointment. I wouldn't waste time on it again neither would I recommend anyone else to waste their time on this.The composition was boring and nothing came as a surprise.The only possible good thing about this book is that it is written by Nicholas Sparks. The one I read was translated to danish, and if everybody really think this book was a good as they says it is without they're being a typical girl, the blame is on the translator."
5,Good movie...worth the watch.,"I purchased the DVD movie, ""The Notebook"" at the recommendation of a friend. And I can recommend this movie to anyone who is in love, or who has been or wants to be in love.The acting is well done, the story line is charming, and there IS a happy ending to this one.Set aside a Friday or Saturday evening, curl up on the couch, and enjoy!"
1,Peuw! Peuw! Peuw! Peuw!,"This book stunk to high heaven.Please! Who is supposed to believe theseparagons of virtue actually exist?And exactly WHAT makes them the least bitinteresting? I found this book contrivedand phony, the characterswimpy and shallow. I kept falling asleep asI was reading this book. A painful read in all."
1,Not worth it,"This book has a horrible plot. If you are looking for a book that is cliche, and unorignal, then this is the book for you. The only positive aspect of this book is that it is an easy read."
2,Just okay,"I decided to read another Nicholas Sparks novel since A Walk To Remember was so good. I agree with other reviewers who say this story seems too similar to the Bridges Of Madison County movie with Meryl Streep and Clint Eastwood. The premise is good romantic escape, but in the end, the reader is not satisfied.The Notebook is about two people who went out in adolesence, move away to do other things, and then meet in town years later, only to find that the love between them never left. The story could have been great if we knew why they were in love and if we knew the charaters better. I read this on a long car trip, and I'd only read this to cure boredom."
1,The notebook novel,"I was completely dissatified with this purchase as amazon didn't send the correct version of the book. I ordered the book with the characters from the movie on the cover and i was sent and older version that is nothing like what i wanted. I don't give amazon a good review on this one, they didn't get it right at all."
2,in someone's else's hands...,"...this could have been a good book. as it it is: ugh. there's just no personality to it. his writing is so white bread and that sucks any life out of what otherwise could have been a heart twister. there were sparks (no pun intended) of brilliance, but its almost as if it scares him to veer off the straight and narrow and he slams right back into the predictable and banal."
1,Possibly the worst book I ever read,"I am a devoted reader with an open mind. I know how hard it is to write and I would never attack a book or a writer just because I didn't like reading the book. But this is really, really something else. The characters in this book are so phoney, so flat and so unreal they sometimes made me laugh; at other times they made me want to throw up. The storyline just seems to be made of sticky sweet syrup; reading the book virtually gave me a toothache. I can't help pitying those poor trees that were felled to produce the paper on which this book was printed. My advice is: buy and read ANY book but this one: for I am sure ANY book will be better written and will give you more insight into human nature than this one."
2,not my thing,"This was my first Nicholas Sparks novel, and I wanted to read it before seeing the movie. It will probably be my last. The story was very sappy, and the writing was uninspired. It did have one redeeming feature, however, and that was the description of how Noah copes with his wife's dementia. I don't know if this approach really works with Alzheimer's patients, but it seemed reasonable to me."
5,Fantastic talent,"The Triumph and the Glory is the only other novel I've read in recent years that made me cry. The Notebook:A Novel was simply beautiful, a heartwarming story that you will thoroughly enjoy."
2,disapointing,"I read this book first and then reda spark's other book, Message in a Bottle, and the two hardly compare. The ending really got slow and I lost interest. The way the book anded really just brought down what I thought of the book. But the search for true love rings aloud over the whole book so that made it tolerable."
5,Best of Sparks,"I consider this the best of his three books thus far. I read it after Message in a Bottle and found it much better. I became emotionally attached with the story and the characters (a sign of a really great book), much more so that in his other books. This is a very touching story of love, really heartwarming."
5,Better than a fairy tail,From the moment I picked up the book I was unable to put It down. Nickolas Sparks has such a way with putting the datails of his story so deep in your mind and heart It felt as if I was living every moment of It. I loved loved loved It. Wont miss your next book Nick.
1,Cliche and dull,There was no conflict in this story that was actually confronted at any point. The romance was just... ugh. I don't even know how to describe it. There was nothing new and intriguing about this story.
2,Simple Love Story,"`The Notebook' is apparently a worthwhile read for those that enjoy simple love stories, but for the rest of us it possesses not a single redeeming feature to warrant tolerating its plodding and boring storyline."
4,A good substantive romance,"This is a good book on the themes of lost love---and wasted loves. It reminded me of Silent Bell, the new book by Gary Drake, in the way it dealt with letting the obvious love of our life get away, and then wonder years later. I recomend this. I recommend both Sparks and Drake!"
4,One of the most touching stories I've read in a long time.,"I just recently read ""The Bridges of Madison County"" and this was just as well written. I was actually crying while reading the book on the train on the way to work. I just recently got married and was amazed to feel that the love these two people shared keep the torch lit for so long. It is a great feeling to have someone love you that much and just reminded me how much I love my husband."
3,Okay but overrated,Nicholas Sparks is obviously a good writer which is why he has sold so many books. But I expected this book to be better considering how good his other books are. I have read the Last Song and Walk to Remember which both were at least three times as good as this. I think it is because this was one of the first books he ever wrote. Don't get me wrong it wasn't bad but I wouldn't reccomend this book for those who have never read Nicholas Sparks books. His other books are much better.
5,Still in love with this story !,I have seen this movie many times already but still loved the book. It is still a great love story.
3,Meh,"This book was ok. I had high expectations for the novel as I'd heard so many positive reviews. It seemed underdeveloped with the characters lacking great depth. Noah was better developed than Allie and I did have a bit of a soft spot for the guy, but I was still underwhelmed. And the last chapter was just plain depressing. Hasn't this guy had enough heartache? I don't think this author is for me."
4,Great love story,In love with the love these characters share... the story is beautiful and takes you to a different world and time
3,The Notebook,I will be honest and say that I read this book after seeing the movie and I feel that the movie out does the book and therefore left me disappointed.
4,So Much better then Bridges of Madison County,"I have not been so touched by a book since Bridges of Madison County. The Notebook, in my opinion was 100 times better. I have recently moved from Dallas to North Carolina where this story took place. He described everything about this state perfectly.I myself fell in love with Noah Calhoun. I have never identified with a character in a book like I did with Allie. Allie faced choices that almost anyone can identify with. This book tugged at my heart, made me weep, and taught me that you always have a choice and no one but yourself can draw out your life for you."
1,A terrible read...,"I can't believe that this book was an international bestseller. Who liked it that much? I read it because it was recommended to me by a friend, but I hated it. I couldn't wait for it to be done. The writing was horrible. I felt like I was reading a sixth grader's term paper. I left it on a plane after I finished it--God knows I don't want to add it to my library."
1,What am I missing here????,"I love great stories, but this is not one of them. I am sorry I wasted a few hours, but at least I didn't spend a dime on it. This is a ""Bridges...."" wanna be but clearly isn't. Just too too mushy for words with no real substance. It may be awhile before I try another of his novels. Too many other great ones out there!"
5,An incredible page-turner from Chapter One!!,"The Notebook is, by far, the most touching love story I have ever read. To have your lover say all the wonderful, meaningful things that a woman needs and loves to hear. I will have to admit, I cried from the very first chapter.My husband also read The Notebook. After finishing the last page, he walked over to me, picked me up in his arms, hugged me tightly and said, ""I only wish I could say half the things he said."" That, I will never forget.This book will definitely make you want to be a better person, wife, and lover. Sometimes we take everything for granted.I will definitely be waiting for Sparks' books in the future."
3,a quick easy read,"A quick easy read. But as other reviews state, it drags on with the ""love"" stuff. If you are looking for a sappy book that is very easy to read this is the book. You can read it in one sitting (about 3 hours) and it seems as though he wrote this book in the same amount of time."
4,i good love story~!,"this is one of the best love storys ever! my friend knew i liked the movie ALOT so she told me to read the book and i loved it even more, altough i liked the end to the movie better it is still worth the read"
5,This is a comfort book! Just like chicken soup when sick!,"When I think of the Notebook, I think of safety. There is nothing safer to read than a love story. Well, somethings can be a boring read, but that doesn't mean it is safe to read. I recommend the Notebook to everyone, male or female, to read. It isn't just a female romance novel. Indeed, it is something special that all can relate to! Romantic, tear jerker, etc...it covers all bases."
5,So Romantic,"I read this book a couple of years ago, but I haven't forgotten how romantic it is. It started my love for Mr. Spark's novels. They're mostly short, but very sweet love stories. Sure to bring a tear to your eye."
5,wonderful!!!!!,"This book was wonderful. I yearn for that kind of love and I was so enraptured by the story that i could not put the book down for 2 hours. I would recommend it to anyone who is tired of cynicism and dry wit. A great love story, plain and simple."
4,The Note Book,"I read this book in one day. I was truly riveted to the story line and it was a good love story. I have not had a good cry in a while and this book really touched my heart, to realize how true love never dies and stays with you throughout. The writer nicholas sparks is really good with words and imagery and the words came to life. I really loved it."
3,Good read,Very sweet love story well written. I was let down by the ending but that may be because I have seen the movie.
2,Ugh,"It was too mushy for me. I couldn't get into it. I finally finished the book mainly because so many people had told me how wonderful it was. I guess it wasn't my type of book. All it was, was feelings, feelings, feelings. It never really went anywhere. It's hard for me to list a book as ""I don't like it"" because I can usually find some quality to like in a book which I did here when the couple was young, but eventually even that got to me. I'm glad the author is doing well, he has quite a following."
2,boring,I found it very boring. I had heard good things but it really didn't hold my interest. The man in the story was very sweet and it was a great love story.
1,TheNotebook,"This book was way overated. The first few chapters were good but most of the book was written from the nursing home and was very boring. I got the point after one chapter, didn;'t need half a book. I feel I wasted my money on this book."
2,OH PLEASE!,"I am disappointed and somewhat alarmed at all the 10's this book has received here. Can't anybody see through the paper-thin prose and constant cliches? I love a good love story as much as the next person, and as a matter of fact, I am involved in a lost-and-then-found-again relationship similar to Allie and Noah's which has brought me much joy, but I was truly embarrassed by the author's simplistic, unrealistic, trite writing."
2,Too trite for words,"The author has discovered all the ingredients for success -- make it short, use the same cliches over and over, refrain from developing any depth to the characters, provide no insight to the characters' personalities, skip opportunities for conflict, develop no character flaws. I never felt as if I really knew Allie or Noah. There was no develpment of Allie, what she'd been doing during the 14 years since she'd last seen Noah. To justify her seeking out Noah, she simply says over and over again, ""I was just wondering what you'd been up to."" Please! These characters sound cardboard with dialogue that could have been written for a grade school paper entitled ""What I did during my summer vacation."""
5,Mingle of Love and Beautiful Romance,"A very well written story, it contain a huge amount of beautiful feelings and love. A real romance which could be hard to find in reality or even in other romantic stories. The writer has a magic of letting you - as a reader- feel, sence even get hurted with every single events on the story. You would have this feeling of striking the story's event somhow and beg Allie not to leave Noah again specially after those long years of separation ( which is going to happened any way later on). Personaly, i found myself deeply involved on this story, i found my self crying specially when the writer was describing the relation between Noah and Allie when she got sick with Al Zahaimer, and how Noah feelings towards her never changed a bit. I should realy congratulate the writer on this amazing story which makes you enjoy and live for a short time the real romance & love that has disapeared from our real world to find it only on his books."
4,The Notebook is the best novel I have read in a long time.,"A friend lent me this book to read and I could barley put it down. I would be up until 1:00 or 2:00 in the morning reading. The Notebook is the best novel I have read in about 9 years. I just bought A Walk To Remember, and I can't wait to get started on it. The Notebook is the first book I have read by Sparks, and will continue to seek his work. If you are looking for a good novel to sit back, kick your shoes off, and enjoy then may I suggest this one!"
1,More sap than maple syrup,"I'm not sure why certain romance novels seem to ""catch on"" and become mega-bestsellers while others are relegated to the pink-and-baby-blue-softcolor shelves. In this case, I don't see what all the hype is about. There are much better books out there to spend your time with."
2,"Predictable, unbelievable, and unrealistic","Adequately written for the general public, yet way over the edge for believability. Admittedly tugged at my heart strings, but also pulled my leg."
2,"Touching at times, but far too predictable","Watch out Harlequin! This book reminded me of those ridiculous grocery store checkout romances I read in Junior High. Although the book is so short, it took me over a month to read it. The plot was non-existent and the characters were cardboard cut-outs. The dialogue became so cheesy at times that I had to put the book down lest I puke. I kept hoping it would get better but it never did. It did have a few touching moments, but overall this was a very disappointing read."
3,Couldn't Finish it,I read about half of The Notebook and I really could not finish it. It was just way to boring. When it started I didn't even understand what was going on. Even the movie I thought was boring. I normally do relatively like Nicholas Sparks books but this one I just could not get through.
3,"Decent - Great story, mediocre writing","I loved the story of The Notebook! The plot was fantastic and filled with deep, sincere emotion. Nicolas Sparks uses a lot of visual imagery within this book, which helps you to visualize everything that is going on. Be prepared! This is a tear-jerker. I have never cried when reading any book - before this one. The emotion is so raw and so real that you experience the same feelings as the characters.I would have given this story 5 stars, but I feel as if the story was lacking. The book was very short, a quick read. I feel as if a lot was left out and the story need further substance. Also, I do not like Sparks style of writing. He doesn't switch lines when a different characters dialogue begins. To some it may not be a big deal, but I found it hard to keep up with WHOM was saying WHAT. I've never seen the movie; however, I'm disappointed to say that the movie may actually be better than the book."
1,AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE,"I saw the film and it had me in tears and so I thought .... lets try the bookBIG MISTAKEIt not only failed miserbaly to live up to the film and my expectations but also ruined one of the best films I've ever seen. All I can say is the script writer is an absolute genius, because he/she managed to create absolute genius from a pile of rubbish writing I wouldn't taint my compost heap with. How do you go from Dear John to this???Did Nicholas Sparks fall and hit his head??????Go out and buy the film... you will cry like a baby and enjoy it immensly, but do NOT buy the book!! it will destroy the film for you forever!!!"
1,Terrible!,"Am I the only one? I thought this book was one of the worst I have ever read! It was written so badly that it was embarrassing to read. It was so cliched, so unimaginative, so awkward! If this was a bestseller it should be proof that anyone can write a book."
1,WB got riped off,"I've got to say this is THE WORST book I've read in a very long time. The plot was... wait... what plot? Character development was no where to be seen. Descriptive passages so boring I wanted to stick a fork in my eye to breakup the boredom... I kept reading thinking it might get better, in the end I was skipping whole sections just to finish. The idea is a great one, if only the story that went along with it was remotely interesting or made sense.Hard to believe Warner Brothers paid him a million dollars for this book. They should have saved their money."
1,I agree with erinleigh1,I didn't expect it from Nicholas Too..The first book I've read was ( A walk to remember ) & it was such a brilliant book.. it was totally dirfferent about a pure LOVE...(the note book) is an absolute (yuk)..! & I'm not trying to be rude! no.. I'm just upsettttt!!!the book made no sense @ all..it was disgusting! a real Yukkkkkkkkkkkkk
4,A Notebook's Journal,The Notebook is the greatest love story since Romeo and Juliet. Nicholas Sparks has out-done himself this time. The Notebook moved me greatly. It made me realize that true is a never-ending story and that it can only be found once in a lifetime. Even though Allie and Noah have fights they work through it and their love grows stronger. This should encourage couples everywhere to work through their disagreements because true love conquers all. I give Nicholas Sparks two thumbs up for this moving and touching story.
2,WHAT?,i read this book up until the point he reunited with allie and then felt the story was over. when it jumped to them being in the nursing home and her not remembering him i lost focus and was bored. i honestly could not read on and put the book away. maybe i need to try again since it has such great reviews i don't know. i will NOT however see the movie as that definitely ruins the whole book reading experience since hollywood loves to change things so as too seem appealing to more people. not my favorite nicholas sparks book but still have NOT given up on him either as i have read quite of few of his that i just loved and will read again.
1,Not my kind of book,This was a very boring read. A lot of words without saying anything. A bit too unbelievable.
1,There are miracles in this world,"How this manuscript even got published in the first place is a miracle. Truly. This book is an inspiration for any aspiring writer because it shows you that almost anything can get published and marketed these days. It uses every cliche in the book and breaks about every rule about writing fiction. ""I love you, Allie."" ""I love you, too."" This is dialogue that is supposed to move me? Cardboard characters, weak plotting, trite suspense devices. At least Bridges of Madison County (another terrible book, but a good movie) had some confrontation scenes to make the characters seem somewhat believable. Allie is as aspiring artist, Noah likes to sit on the porch. These are the ONLY ""qualities"" these characters have. Using Alzheimer's to put a ""spin"" on the cliched plot can't be called anything other than a disgrace."
2,"An easy, forgettable read","Nothing really happens in this book. It reads like a high school student assignment. The end has a touching aspect to it which brought it up from a one-star review to a two-star review. If there's bad weather at the beach and it's the only book there, go ahead and read it. If, however, you have the choice to do anything else with the precious moments in your life, do that instead. There are better love stories."
2,Made-for-TV material with not enough to exceed an hour,"I'm not sure what the big deal here is especially knowing that this has been a popular best-seller. This is one (long) declaration of love that leads us to a non-existent crescendo. A disappointing, but thankfully short and easy read."
1,Poor writing and totally predictable story line,"Awful. Silly. I can stand a predictable story line if the writing is good, but this was the pits. If this guy actually considers himself an author, then I'm Ernest Hemingway. I got the book as a gift. I may never forgive the friend that did this to me!!!!! This book is an insult!"
3,The Notebook by Nicholas Sparks,"Wow! This is a great book! If you are looking for a novel with literary merit, this is not it, but a good heart wrenching story, this is the one! The Notebook is a classic fairy-tale, love overcomes all. The majority of the book takes place in the past and is being read out of a notebook. After Noah and Allie fell in love, they were separated for fourteen years. Upon meeting again, Allie (engaged to an attorney) and Noah's love was rekindled. Falling in love with Noah was a complete ""no, no"" for Allie because of societal pressure put on her by her family and friends to marry for ""class."" Allie loves both Lon and Noah, thus she is faced with the ultimate decision of who to pick, the stable sensible one or the laid back anything goes man. Sparks keeps the reader wondering until the very last chapter. Personally I cried, but tears do not always imply sorrow. This novel is a true romance novel, full of tragedy and hope that love will and does concur all."
3,Entertaining read,"The love story in this book is touching, and even though it is written to pull at your heart strings, it's also believable. It's nice to have a story that is not cynical about true love"
5,This really hits you where you live if you are older.,"How could Nicholas Sparks possibly know what it is like to see yourself and your spouse deteriorate with age? This book made me cry so much I had to put it down often to get control of myself. I look around and see all our friends, and us, struggling to live with a myriad of physical and mental problems like Noah and Allie. So, forget the romance, which is lovely, and read this book for the insight about ageing."
4,Good to curl up on the couch with,"I have not seen the movie and was glad to read the book. It's a nice book to read at the end of the day, just curling up on the couch and getting lost in this fabulous love story. The story is beautiful and the book is very well written. The characters are very likable.I just thought it was a little unbelievable that after so many years she just drove in to see him and he happened to be home."
5,The most romantic story I've ever read .,"Because I live in North Carolina, it was even more visually powerful. There is some truth even today about the Southern caste system of marrying the ""right"" man. Sparks made both characters feel with their whole hearts. A story about the one and only ""perfect"" love each of us deserves. I truly enjoyed every minute of reading this book."
3,"Sappy, not well-written, ... only the ending was interesting","Cheesey, full of cliches, there is no depth in the characters whatsoever, and their love does not ring true. The ending in the retirement home was the only portion of the novel I really enjoyed - not because it was well-written or rang true, but because it was an interesting concept. However, it read like a cheesey young adult romance."
3,For once the movie is better then the book,I was very excited to read this book at first after seeing the classic movie. Unfortunately I do not enjoy the book very much. It skins over the young Ali and Noah which is what I actually wanted to know more about (what the movie left out) overall it is a good read if you have seen the movie otherwise read the last song by Nicholas sparks instead
1,"Actually, no stars for Nicholas Sparks","Nicholas Sparks seems to be under the mistaken impression that mediocre writing and a contrived plot can be hidden under adjectives and long-winded description. It can't. This is writing for money's sake, without any poetry, emotion, or heart. About four pages into the book, the reader basically can figure out the gist of the plot. And did we really need that five-page description of cooking a crab dinner? Allie and Noah are merely caricatures of actual human beings, and Sparks barely touches real human emotion here.. All in all, a disappointing and actually unbearable reading experience."
4,Taps into the deepest emotional core.,"This story is a fast read, yet one of the most beautiful books I have ever read. I couldn't put it down. The only time I did, was to stop myself from getting so lost in the book. I had to look up and distinguish my reality. A book that can do that, is worth reading. You won't finish this with dry eyes though. Enjoy, it is heart-warming."
3,Early promise,"Story initially engaging but then in the middle it was ""and now?"". A little too syrupy for me. But I liked the contrast between the young & old couple, and also the insight into alzheimers from a partner's perspective."
3,Were there such things as tea bags in 1946?,"I really like a good love story and I usually find that the books that make me cry are some of my favorites. Somehow The Notebook falls far short. I question the accuracy of the time period. I think perhaps Mr. Sparks interjected too much into his grandparents' love affair, equating it with what a modern day affair might be."
4,Pleasant quick weekend read,"Right in the middle I was disappointed by an unnecesary love scene.. but other than that this is a quick read and pleasant for one weekend.I enjoyed the writing and the story, but it is a watery romance with little robust character. Still, as I mentioned: pleasant."
1,I felt robbed.......,"I had heard of this book so many times and seen interviews on TV, I decided I would read it. In fact, it was chosen as my bookgroup's selection to discuss this month. But I surely felt robbed as I read it. For the first half of the story I kept waiting for something to happen... during the second half I lost all hope. I still can't shake the feeling that this guy, with his business sense, said, ""I'm certainly not a writer, but I can sell a book""! He wrote with a shameful shallowness, and it makes me sad that such a book became a bestseller. It says something dreadful about the mentality of our society."
3,the movie is much better,"Loving the movie, the book gives you a little bit more info but is not as romantic.But if you are a fan I recomended.Awesome story"
1,disapointment!,"Usually I say when a book it turned into a movie, the movie lacks something. In this case though I felt the movie was able to portray the emotion of their love much better than the book. As I was reading the book I felt as if he wrote the story as a script for the movie then wrote the book as an afterthought. On its own it is a very good book, I personally felt more emotion from the movie."
2,"Great premise, awkwardly presented","Nicholas Sparks had a great idea: the reunion between lovers lost to each other until post World War II in North Carolina. A Sparks book seems to radiate a charm around it. The thing, though, that I didn't like too much about the book was the somewhat unrealistic air that was presented. Such a story was so lacking of passion. I suggest this book for most people, but not to the fraction of readers a bit more critical."
2,do not read this book,"I looked up this book to review it because I think it's the worst book I ever read. No wait, that was the one time I read a Danielle Steele book. Anyway... The writing is like cardboard, dry and stiff, and that's how you leave emotionally. There is nothing engaging about the romance - which is the most unromantic love I've ever read about. It may have been a good story written by someone else.I give it 2 stars because the segment at the end is more engaging and touching, unlike the main bulk of the book, but still even that part should have been much better. Bad writing."
2,Awful,"I don't tend to write bad reviews - but I wanted to warn people if they were thinking of reading this one. If you're looking for a sappy short read that you can get through in a few hours, go ahead and read it. But if you were looking for a memorable work of fiction that has believable characters and a solid storyline, keep looking. I haven't found anything to recommend instead of this book quite yet, but The Notebook definitely isn't it."
3,Not as good as the movie...,The book was good but if you love the movie you won't love the book... it is a love story but not from the same angle... I was disapointed in it.
5,Nothing could ever compare!,"The Notebook by Nickolas Sparks is the BEST book I have read yet. This is a story of a summer love. The younge man , Noah, falls in love with a younge rich vacationer,Allie.They come twe totally different classes. Her parents despise Noah because of his financial difference.The younge girls parents after the summer ends take Allie back to the city. Noah and Allie try to keep in touch but can they have a real long distance relationship. Allie meets another man; she loves him but in a different way than she loves Noah. Who will she chooose in the end? She refuses to hurt anyones feeelings. The suspense kills you. This book is remarkable. If you have not read this book yet, you must."
3,romantic but...,"The special summer when allie and noah once fell in love was quite short. And 14 yrs. later whr a lot of things could've happened didnt stop them frm wondering on ""what if's"". Noah and Allie are both stuck-up people frm the past because what they found was real love. Their past love story was romantic but the hell with nicholas sparks cuz it left me pondering ""What then?!it didnt made me cry at all even though it was sad how allie cant remember noah and how strong thier love was to each other that it can create a ""miracle"". The ending was very sweet it AlMost made me cry."
2,"to fast, to desultorily and to shallow","Actually I thought this would be a nice time-passer after seeing Message in the bottle and that for a second time I would be able to escape into emotional trip. But the story was too foreseen, caracters and whereabouts of story were similiar to that in Message. Again there was water, this time a river, and Allison is a painter as Catherine in MITB. There were to many similarity with MITB that this novel can stand fo itself and give something new and on the other hand that old romantic passion. I was specially mindful to letters, for a search of that little moments that MITB made my life more genuin. But those were nothing comparable to ones in MITB and though I read it in several hours it has left me a taste of a bitter orange. If you would like to read beautifull, subtile love story, try Herman Hesse's Gertrud"
3,Spark-ingly Sweet,"Nicholas Sparks' bailiwick is tender, tear-jerking tomes. And there is nothing wrong with that. Enjoying ""Message In A Bottle"" led me to this short and sweet love story.In this novel, we meet Noah Calhoun. A rugged scamp of a man who is still yearning for the past love of his life. Allie Nelson is now a socialite engaged to a wealthy attorney. Alas, she also craves her long ago romance with the boy that took her breath away.Sparks does a complete job of making a twist on an old plotline. Including conundrum victories and glimpses into aging human behavior. As I was pulled into these characters lives, the haunting song ""Where've You Been"" by Kathy Mattea, kept whirlpooling in my mind.So, if you are in the mood for action adventure, look elsewhere. If you want a simple, sweet, enduring love story.....grab your hankie and indulge.other reading suggestions: ""The Last Valentine"" by James PrattThank you for your interest & comments--CDS"
2,Cotton Candy Novel,"This is a cutesy little book about Noah and Allie who've lost track of each other since their teenage years. When Noah returns home from WW2, Allie visits. Will they get together despite the fact that Allie is engaged? I think that sums up the plot rather well. You can probablly write the rest of the story yourself. Its sappy, syrupy sweet and makes Bridges of Madison County look like a Hemingway novel. But yeah, its romantic, its what you wish romance in real life could always be like. Makes you wonder if everyone can write a novel and be successful?"
5,A wonderful love story,"I'm surprised that the most recent readers who reviewed this book were so disappointed. I thought it a touching love story. Realistic? Who cares. I cried though most of the book and have recommended it to many and purchased it as a gift for those who would appreciate it. It's a book to pass on, and on, and on..."
4,The Notebook,"I read this book in one sitting. It is a wonderful story of love lost and love found. The story is so real, it could very easily be a true story. I felt like I was right there, listening to Noah read from his notebook to the love of his life. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and would love to see this in a movie format!"
1,Crap!,"What a waste of time. My wife and I just read The Notebook and were disappointed by almost every facet of it. Most of the dialogue was contrived and totally unreal. I don't care how romantic Noah is drawn up to be, no man speaks like that; unbelievable (in a bad way). One reviewer said the ending was creepy, and I would say that is putting it nicely. Another thing that was really stupid was that Sparks tries to give Allie virtue, yet she cheat's on her fianc√© without remorse. Total character flaw, again unbelievable.Did I mention the writing was horrid? Sparks jumps between perspectives way to much. Third person is good, but he puts us in the mind of Allie and Noah in the same scene on more than one occasion. It surprises me Warner bought the rights in the first place. Not only that but the editor should be fired.I paid a mere 5.95 for the paperback and trust me that was too much."
1,wish i could un-read it,"too melodramatic, definitely written for all the miss lonely-hearts out there. brought it along with me on a trip, had to read various passages out loud to my travel companion so we could laugh at its ridiculousness. really preposterous finale. sole good point is that i only wasted about 2 hours reading it. would not recommend this book to anyone. havent seen the movie and probably wont at this point!!"
2,"Well, at least I could finish it","I decided to read this book because it was recommended to me by my cousin as a book of unconditional love. I found it to be cliched, vapid, and predictable - way too predictable.If a book is really bad, I won't keep reading. I was almost there with this book. If you like romance novels, you'll probably like this book better than I did.As for the unconditional love part, yeah, it's there, but I think that I have seen the scenario from the end of this book (to say more would be a spoiler) in real life and don't see that the story here stands out more clearly as a shining example.Oh well, on to some of the other fantastic literature out there just waiting for me to read."
4,The Notebook,"If you enjoy relational fiction, this book will keep you turning pages. As you proceed through the story, Nicholas Sparks provides additional details of the conditions that exist between the parties involved. Slowly unwinding the circumstances of why The Notebook was being read and pulling the reader into the love story as it developed through the years. Even before Allie's choice between Lon and Noah is revealed, a ground swell of romance causes the reader to desire one over the other."
2,A silly book...,"Not much to say. A genre romance with a twist. How the sorts of books that are on the best seller list these days get there, I will never understand."
1,Simply the worst,"I cant' believe I could read something worse than the Bridges of Madison County. Nothing is believable in this novel. I still wonder how the author could come up with that stupid end (without that it could have deserved a rating 2). There is more to love than sex, mr. Sparks, especially (and hopefully) after your hair starts whitening."
5,Page turner like no other!,"I read this book in two days! I fell in love with it. I had it on my list of books to read and when I saw a clip for the movie, I ran out and bought it so I could read it before the movie. I cannot WAIT to see the movie! They seem very similar, book & movie so I am just thrilled.If you love to read love stories, this will touch you like no other! That is all I can really say without giving away too much. I couldn't stop crying!"
4,a quick read of love,"A quick read of LOVE. If you read at a decent speed, you can finish this book before you fall asleep in one evening. haven seen the movie first, you can visualize all of the characters in the book. It makes you wonder, if you are still single, if you will ever experience this form of true love in your life. Thus, it can make you feel very depressed if you start comparing yourself to the characters in the book."
3,Ending,"The book really captivated me. In fact the second I got it, I started to read it, and finished it the same day. The story was just so brilliant. I really fell in love with it. And I completely understood all the feelings, it was like I was there. The only problem was the ending, it was, like someone else said, too short, it was too sudden, and I wanted more of the beginning. I really want to see the film, I just hope it doesnt end as quickly as it did in the book. Maybe its just the way the author writes. Just like with a Walk to Remember the ending was sudden. Just like bam, it was over. Anyways, the book is really, again, very captivating, and just sucks you into it, you cant look away."
3,Something was missing...,"Overall, I thought this was a great book. I had seen the previews for the movie on TV, and that's what interested me in it at first. I've never been one to say that ""the book is always better than the movie,"" but I'll be interested to see how the movie vs. the book pans out on this one.Sparks did an excellent job in creating a vision with his detail and descriptive language. There were even a few points during my reading that I found myself picturing the story happening between my first love and I! However, I was a little disappointed that Sparks got me so involved in the story but then decided to tell the most important parts (I don't want to give away the ending) through a second party conversation. And I was a little disappointed with the ending because I thought it ended very suddenly and without a lot of closure.So, I give the book 3 stars because of the memories and emotions it evoked."
2,Predictable,"I wanted to read this book after seeing the previews for the movie, which made it look really good. However, I was surprisingly disappointed. Reading the story, I kept expecting some major plot twist or turn, but - surprise, surprise - it ends exactly how you think it will. You automatically know who the man and woman are when you begin reading the book, and it's not hard to guess who Allie chooses to marry at the end. Also, it was kind of hard to believe that they could so easily revive their 3-month relationship after 14 years. Fourteen years ago I was six! That's a good bit of time there. And the way the book ends is kind of creepy...I wouldn't recommend this book unless you're a sappy romantic who cried at ""Titanic."""
2,A disappointment,"After hearing all the countless praises and optimistic reviews of this book, I was actually looking forward to reading it...was I disappointed! The whole feel of the book was it was trying too hard to evoke an emotional response from its readers. The only response I managed to muster was laughter. The premise had all the makings of a promising novel. What resulted instead was a poorly executed made-for-tv movie-of-the-week script disguising itself as a touching human drama. The characters were annoying...one dimensional and lacking any sense of depth or reality for that matter. I kept hoping the story would get better and it finally did---when I closed the very last page and realized it was finally over"
2,Let's be honest - this is a poorly written book.,"Surely there must be someone else who thinks as I do about this poorly written book. The second part of the book which recounts the meeting between the man and the woman has the worst dialogue I can remember reading in a book. I don't know how many times he writes that the main character is sitting in the house but ""stares at the stars"" as he says something - or he ""stared at the moon."" He sets up dialogue with phrases such as ""he went on to say."" I was so distracted by the terrible writing. I think the reader is a personable handsome man who had a very good idea for a book, plus a good agent, but someone should have worked with him on writing dialogu"
2,Sad!,"I have read all three of Mr. Sparks books and he is a very good storyteller however, Mr. Sparks never writes a good ending to his books. When so much time is spent in reading a book only to get to the end and it is so sad leaves a very bad taste in ones mouth. Hopefully, his next book will have nicer endings or endings that can be clearly figured out. Right now I, like so many other people I know have no desire to read another sad doom and gloom saga."
1,SHAME ON WARNER!,"Gimme' a break! What a horrible commentary on the state of letters when a book like this actually becomes a bestseller. Trite, sappy, poorly written, worse than the worst ""romance."" Next to Sparks, LaVyrle Spencer is Tolstoy -- REALLY! Shame on the publisher for publishing the book, promoting it like crazy to an unsuspecting public, then taking our money for it. It's simply not worth reading. Don't bother."
1,"One Dimensional, Trite...No better than a Harlequin novel","After reading this book , there are several comments that need to be made. First of all, we understand there is an audience for this simplistic love story, but for anyone searching for something more, they will be sorely disappointed. Our book club found the story very formulaic, trite, banal and uninspiring. As women, we were disappointed at the shallowness of the characters, especially Allie. She is presented as the ""virginal"" fantasy who saves herself for 14!!!! years until she is resuscitated by the strong and virile Noah. Until then she has stifled her artisitic creativity while Noah led a relatively full, albeit solitary life. The storyline had the potential to be interesting and provocative. Unfortunately, we are given one-dimensional characters whose love for each other seems free of struggle and not grounded in reality. They make it look too easy. We wish the best of luck to Mr. Sparks on his next novel."
1,This doesn't deserve one star,"This is by far one of the worst books I've ever read in my life. The cheese is laid on entirely too thick, and everything about Sparks's style reminds of the books my 12-year-old sister reads. Do not read unless you're 12, or unless you enjoy crap books that mock the theme the sell-out, commercial author is trying to portray."
1,Nauseated,"Let me start off with saying that I absolutely loved the movie, which is what motivated me to buy the book. I can now say that this book has made me not want to watch the movie for a very, very long time.What an absolutely nauseating 'novel' (let's not kid ourselves, novel is being generous. Let's call it a short story). I'm one of the sappiest, mushiest people I know and I could hardly get through this book. I promptly threw it away once finished. Sparks should have at least attempted to make his characters' dialogue even the least bit realistic or believable. The constant over-the-top 'her eyes glistened like glowing emeralds in a sea of shimmering diamonds and she wondered how she ever made it through one breath without seeing the ripple of his chest' writing was just way too much. WAY too much. This book managed to thoroghly nauseate me. Anyone need some paper to start a bonfire??"
5,Perfect,"This book was perfect, it couldn`t have possibly been any better, I just got to see the movie made of it, WONDERFUL!This is one grand writer!"
4,A good read--hard to put down.,"Sparks has a style of writing that doesn't strike you as impressive when you first start reading, but he has a way of drawing you into his story and really communicates his characters well. The book is not long, but will leave you satisfied. I also recommend The Wedding, and The Guardian."
1,Typical love triangle,"I do enjoy love stories but this is beyond your average love story. This book is extremely sappy and all the character is dull and boring. None of their personailites stand out that attracts the reader to them.If you love sappy love stories, then this book is for you."
1,Sooooooooooooo bad,"Very bad book. I like romance, did not find this book romantic. Incredibly depressing, made me cry a lot and while I was crying I was still thinking that it was one of the worst books I've read in my life. I thought this book might be good because of all the favorable readers' reviews here. But now I've learned not to judge a book by that. Much better way it to check the the blurbs on the book jacket. If there aren't any from good sources, it's to be avoided."
3,"Good book, but beware......","I enjoyed Nicholas Sparks' other two novels very much. This book was very good, but you really need to have a positive outlook on life to read this. The first part of the book was like any other typical love story. In the middle of the book, you are brought into the present of the main characters in their seventies and eighties. the rest of the book drags a bit, and focuses too much on the feebleness of the two main characters. This is the part where you will need the whole box of kleenex. The end of the book made me feel happy for the main characters, but depressed about my own impending aging process and where it will someday lead. Believe me, you will feel like you need a prosac for the rest of the day. If Sparks focused a little less on the detailed aging process of the characters, I think this book could have been as much of a romantic heart-warming love story as his other two books."
1,Maudlin,"Finally retired from working at the public library and decided to do what I'd promised myself while working: Read a Nicholas Sparks' book to see what all the fuss was about. I've always contended that the reason there are so many different kinds of books in the world is becaue there are so many different kinds of readers. But ""The Notebook""? I skipped through the last 75 pages. Maudlin. Foolishly sentimental."
5,I couldn't put this book down.,I took this book with me everywhere. I could not put it down. It was a wonderful book and I recommend everyone read it if your interested in a great romance novel.
4,The Notebook...a peace of hope.,"I really did love the book. You either like it or you don't. But for those who did (including myself), It was by far a peace of hope for those hopless romantics out there. It's always about the ""one"" who got away...and how someone can wait, search, and rekindle somethintg that once was. The ending was sad, but it fit the whole out look on life. Nothing lasts forever, except love. It's a must read."
4,Worth your time,"""The Notebook"" is not as good as ""The Rescue"" and ""A Bend in the Road"" but keep in mind that it is the first book Nicholas Sparks ever published. It is short - I finished it in one day - and very emotional toward the end. If you like the ""happily ever after"" type endings, then you might be disappointed. But I found ""The Notebook"" to be a wonderful story of true everlasting love."
4,Love story in its best meaning,"Even though The Notebook came out already 1996 and movie in 2004, I just found this book and decided to read it.It's a love story and this is the best way of describing it. Live-long love story which mirrors characters' life during their lives from the moment they meet until the final days of their lives. The writing was slowly paced and it really suited to the story. Thoughts and descriptions gave an overview of the depth of their love story.It was beautiful and sad book.4 stars out of 5."
4,A Folksie Romeo & Juliet with a twist.,"My sister recommended this book to me because of the similarities to my parents and our own family. The interweaving of the current with the stories of the past keeps the narrative interesting and builds some dramatic tension. I get warm fuzzies reading this story of well worn love. It speaks a timeless message in a day when we need to hear it. I think the book could become a classic in time like ""It's a Wonderful Life""."
4,It's so sweet!,"I started reading this book after a friend recommended it to me. It starts off well. Noah ( the main character) gets reunited with his old girlfriend after 15 or so years. Then it jumps ahead 50 years and starts to get confusing. In the end it all works out. This book is very touching and romantic. I heard alot about the ending being a tearjerker, so I guess overestimated it. I didn't cry at all because I kept waiting for something extremely sad."
3,here's what i think...,"obviously if you've read all these reviews and are all the way down to mine, you'll have noticed that people either love or hate this book. there are few in between. the people who love it are the ones who haven't been reading great litereature for a very long time. they have a different point of view. they are able to appreciate it because they can understand it and it is within their realm of understanding. the people who are able to read the more intricate writers and who are able to understand them are the ones who think that this book is a piece of trash. it's all relative."
4,Made Me Cry,"I can't recall a book that ever brought tears to my eyes. This is the first. Although the story is pretty predictable, it is extremely touching. The relationship of the characters is one that most of us long for and few of us get. If you read it you'll be sure to enjoy it. Bring tissue."
4,Good,"Saw the movie didn't cry, read didn't cry. Everyone else I know did. It is full of emotion and passion. Almost like Johnny and June."
3,"A good, quick read but far too predictable","Nicholas Sparks' The Notebook is a good, quick read that is reminiscent of Bridges of Madison County. But, this book too closely resembles a cheap romance novel in that it spends too much time focusing on the characters' sexual thoughts and desires. These drawn out passages get old very quickly. This story could have been much more interesting and compelling had Sparks focused more extensively on the true meaning of young love. Conversations about longing and missed opportunities were far too frequent and predictable, given the story line and these characters pasts."
5,TO THOSE WHO GAVE IT A 1 STAR... YOU HAVE NO HEART,"I loved the book because it made you reflect own your own life. Was I really ever in love? Have I experienced true love? Would I have made the same sacrifices? You may or may not believe the story, but it is these questions that are raised from this book that really matter. And to those who could not get passed that, I'm afraid you will never know what it means to give yourself to someone completely and know you are recieving the same, if not, more from your partner. Love is real people, don't be afraid to embrace it."
1,What a waste of time!!!!,"This book has been written a thousand times before Mr Sparks was even born. It's such a common love story, a 12 year old could have written it. You don't even care about the characters because you don't get to know them, and every word is a deja-vu of third rate romance novels. Thank God it's so short!"
1,"Depressing, unrealistic, and shallow","The book covers a deep, heartbreaking subject in a shallow and unrealistic manner.Want to be depressed and bored? If so, this is the book for you!!!"
1,corny book,"this story should be with the books w/ fabio on the cover. I can't believe it is a bestseller. I read this when I was in a book club, totally going into it with an open mind. this is for small-minded folk. These characters are so phoney and the dialogue so corney that I thought I was going to throw up on the book itself. yuck!!!"
1,"Simple story, simply told, but touching at times.","Sparks does what every writer in the business has been told not to do since the beginning of...well, since the beginning. He ignores the concept of viewpoint, switching between characters in the same scene, confusing everyone except those ""romantic"" enough not to notice. The language is pedestrian at best; however, I can't forgive the writer (and apparently editors) who let lines like ""and she smiled softly"" slip through their fingers. When I figure out how one can smile softly, I'll try reading another book by Sparks."
1,This book sucks!,"I read a lot of books and I can't remember the last time I read a book more insulting to my intelligence (perhaps it was Bridges of Madison County)! The writing is dreadful; it reminded me of the Danielle Steel novel I read as a teeny bopper. It's filled with useless descriptions of what the characters were wearing and what they made for dinner and breakfast. The characters are made of poor-quality cardboard. It's unbelievably trite and sappy. I'm so glad I borrowed a copy and I can't wait to give it back...I'm embarrassed to have it on my shelf! IF YOU HAVE ANY SELF-RESPECT, DON'T BUY THIS BOOK! I don't think I live on the same planet as the people who rated this book a ""10."" My book group will get strong warnings from me to stay away from this time waster."
5,Best book and movie ever!,I love this book/movie so much. I could watch and read a million times. Such a great love story! Very classic.
2,Like every other Nicholas Sparks,"While this book may make you cry and is sweet, it definitely made me see how typical Nicholas Sparks is. He uses the same themes or ideas for most of his books and they are all very similar. Because the story seemed so familiar and unoriginal, I really didn't enjoy it. If you have read several of his books already, I don't recommend this book. If this is the first Nicholas Sparks book you have read, you probably will enjoy this book, although others like Dear John or The Last Song are better."
1,The Notebook,I was dissapointed with this story. The movie - unusually - does so much more justice to BOTH characters.I almost wish I hadn't read it.
3,"Sorry, but the movie is better than the book.","I give the author credits for the Hallmark-y feel, romance in the beautiful south, and the touching old love and growing old. Heck, what you would love is those good old days when you spend your free time outside and enjoy the nature where we have limited source, but the old time fun. We like to imagine that and create our own romance with it. That's how it is.What's bad is the writing. Oh gosh, the writing wasn't up to par as you might've image it. You could read the book and/or watch the movie. To me, the movie is better than the book. Of course, without the book, there wouldn't be a movie, so that's where I give the author credits too."
5,Great Read,"Very moving story on how to deal with what life deals to you. Although we all have different ways to handle tradegy, the author's story here is very moving. Highly recommend to all ages."
5,A book that will simply tug at your heart strings.,"I have never read such a great book that made me feel more happy or more sad at the same time. I couldn't put the book down, once I started reading it, I just couldn't wait to see what was going to happen next. I absolutely loved this book, I will definitely buy Nicholas Sparks next book."
2,I really wanted to like it.,"It sounded like something I would like. Really, it did. However, I found the plot hard to follow and there wasn't that much of a story there to begin with. I'm now trying to get interested in Message in a Bottle, and I'm having the same trouble with it. I'm wondering what all the fuss over Sparks is about and just what kind of motion pictures can come from either of the novels."
4,So good,All of Nicholas Sparks books are amazing and they never seize to blow my mind. This is one of my favorites
2,Totally flat,"I'm excited to read this book because of the good buzz it has been getting. Boy am I to be disappointed! There is no humour, and the dialogues make me cringe. The characters are as flat and one-dimensional as pancakes. I won't be reading his ssecond book.Mr Sparks, don't quit your day job."
4,"Despite the flaws, the love shines through.","While this book certainly had its flaws, to include the unrealistic but uplifting ending, the love Noah felt for Allie really shined through. Sparks did a wonder ful job of conveying this love to the reader and made you really feel Noah's struggle in maintaining his sanity as his world fell apart. His abiding love for Allie made his remaining days ons earth worthwhile and full of purpose."
3,Not as good as I expected,Incredibly short and not very detailed. May be the only book I've ever read where the movie was actually better.
3,bought for my sons girlfriend,I bought this for my sons girlfriend she is 24 ...she says she likes to read this guy' stories...so bought it for her from her wish list
3,Okay for the price,"This was a used book so I didn't expect perfection, but the packaging was extremely flimsy and beat up when I received it and the front and back covers had some bends and tears in it which I didn't expect based on the description when I got it. But, for the price I can't complain to much."
4,Beautiful story,"Like a lot of other people, I read the book after watching the movie. A beautiful story worth reading, Nicholas Sparks always deliver."
4,I Cried!!!!!!!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. As I was reading the book there were parts in it where i actually cried as i was reading. That has never happened to me before. I felt the characters so vividly. And whispered a pray for God to send me such a man. The only part is ifeel it ended to quickly, there was more. I wanted to know how he felt when she was her self that amazing time it left me hanging, which i feel the writer wanted to do."
4,movie better than book?,"This summer I decided to try Nicholas Sparks's books. I loved the movie, ""The Notebook"" and wanted to see if the book was as good/better (usually books are better). I don't know if it was because I remembered the movie so well but I found the book not as exciting/touching as the movie."
3,In the Middle,"Having read the book I honestly don't know if it can be titled a romance. To me it was a human interest story. However, the touch and go of love in the story dragged my emotions in. I wish I could believe in the love that transcends medical science, but the emotions of the story confused me. The book is for those who know there is something greater than us in the world. G.Ls."
5,Excellent book,"I read the book before the movie came out. I can't count how many times the writing brought tears to my eyes.I was a little disappointed about how the movie changed the sequence in which things occured. Especially the ending. For by the movie doing what they did at the ending, means it will be impossible for the sequal movie to ever be made, cause Noah is alive and well in the sequal book.Doesn't mean I hate the movie, by no means. I learned always to see a movie and it's book as to completely seperate entities. Cause if you don't, you'll always come up short.Anyway, I really recomment this books, along with every other Sparks book out there."
4,Love standing the test of time....,"This book is a great story. I like that it carries you all the way though their life. Sparks books, while enjoyable, always tend to be a little cliche, and a little too squeaky...but you can't help fall for this story, the characters, their stuggles, and their development....the movie is wonderful too...and very true to the book."
5,A must read,I urge everyone who enjoys a love story to read this. It was a lovely tale-a tear jerking story!
4,Modern Day Fairy Tale,"The Notebook is a beautiful story about to people who truly love each other. Its amazing, especially towards the end of the novel when Allie is suffering from Alzheimers. Noah is able to get her to remember who he is. At the end of the novel Noah's ""commentary"" drags on a little, but still this is an amazing novel. Anyone looking for a good cry, and to have their heart feel warmed, read The Notebook!"
1,Please explain this undeserved phenomenon to me.,"I'm still agog after the reading experience of The Notebook. I believe it's still on the bestseller list and it made the number one spot on some magazine's (ok, so it was Glamour) reader-submitted list of the top-ten love stories of all time. Topping Jane Eyre and Pride and Prejudice no less. Even the number two spot-- Bridges over Madison County--was a mildly diverting read.This debut effort is the most simplistic, hackneyed, uninvolving novel I've ever read. Cognizant of all the hooplaa, I kept waiting for the story to get better. It never did and I was glad when I turned the last page.I see from the reviews that four stars is the average score. Here's a one-star to balance out such undeserved approbation. Of course, Sparks is laughing all the way to the bank over his literary coup."
1,Garbage,This book is a sappy piece of garbage that people couldn't pay me to read again let alone watch a movie about.
2,Not a favorite,"I was so excited to read this book...it had so much potential...but it ended up pretty much sucking. No detail, too quick, and the same sentence and words used over and over and over again. I was hoping that something amazing was going to happen...but, it still sucked. If you are a young kid, you will like it, if you are smart and like something with a little more deepness and effort put into it, you will not like it."
1,Total Wast Of Money,I don't like this book. The movie had far more detail. I can't believe I bought this piece of garbage! It didn't even include the scean were they met at the carnival! TERRIBLE!!!!!!!!
1,How can a book be this boring?,"I hate to give bad reviews, I really do, and when I do I try my best to justify it or still find some good in the book. But after suffering thru ""The Notebook"" I felt compelled to jump to my computer and spill my guts! This is a plain bad book. I picked it up because all the hype and the countless weeks it spent at the top of the bestsellers lists. It looks like a short read so if it is not good at least it will be brief, I thought My mistake! It feels like reading the Bible cover to cover in a foreign language you don't understand!Stay away!"
2,Mindless quick reader,"This is a great book to read while floating on an inner tube at the river. It doesn't take anything to keep on track. You can go splash around, pick up where you left off, doze off, read some more. Yes it is sentimental and I would recommend it to other readers that love to read and cry at the same time.I wonder if Mr. Sparks has had any contact with Alzheimer's patients? I have. It is not pretty. The french kissing was so inappropriate and unreal! I think there could have been some other way of describing to readers their deep affection and love.Thank goodness I got my copy from the library!"
2,Way Too Syrupy,"What a bunch of sticky, gooey, syrupy drivel. Nicholas Sparks is a talented writer, but I'd like to see him employ his skills on a meatier story. This book is hugely successful, and I think that speaks for his WRITING as opposed to his choice of story. For truly gripping reading, turn to Uris, Vidal, earlier Follett, Kingsolver, etc. Sorry, Nick!"
1,MAKE THAT MINUS ONE.,"I paid money for this and what I got was a stupid re-hash of all the other romantic novels I have read in my teen years. Gooey, sappy, this thing was a virtual maple tree of goop. C'mon. Stop buying trash like this. WHERE CAN I SEND IT BACK FOR A REFUND. Excuse me, I think I'll vomit first. Oy."
1,Is this a joke?!?!,"Beyond awful. I can't believe how many people liked this book. The writing was unbearably bad - downright embarrassing in fact. I was relieved to see that there are some people here who agree with me. I really wanted to like the book and the characters, but because it was so boring, transparent and predictable I was unable to even finish. I had to skim over the last 90 pages. I wouldn't have even done that except that a co-worker lent me the book (thank god I didn't spend my own money on it!). It's not that the idea & premise are so bad; it's the insincerity with which it is written that betrays any real depth of emotion. I think it is a sad state of affairs that this a bestseller.And if I wanted to know how to cook a crab dinner, I would have read a cookbook. Boring, boring, boring, boring."
2,Toothache sweet,The story is so sentimental that readers should make a dental appointment on page one. The cookie-cutter characters march through calendar scenery with predictable results.
2,I don't get what the BIG DEAL is?!?!?!?,"I love romance stories....I love tales of triumph...I love stories of lost loves found.... I love happy endings.....But, I didn't love this book, I found this book to be most of the time very boring and predictable...."
2,Another quintessential Sparks book,"This book is sorely predictable, and I never have said this before, but I enjoyed the movie far more than the book. I felt much more emotionally attached to the characters in the movie than in the book. The problem I have with this book is that the characters are very bland and one-dimensional. There is no depth to the characters. A lot huge portion of the book is just the characters actions. ""She drove here..."" ""He placed his hand here..."" ""She walked over there..."" etc. I was also extremely dissapointed with what happened at the very end of the book, and we're talking about the last paragraph here. It was uncalled for and it would have been nice if it ended on a ""cute"" note.The reason I didn't give this book a total thumbs down is because I did choke up a bit and I truly loved Noah's detication to Ally."
3,Eh...,"Comme ci comme caI give it three because I will admit, I read it in about 3 hours flat. I laughed, I cried, I reminisced about first loves. However I could write more creative metaphors in seventh grade and a better book by eighth. Take it to the beach, maybe to a poolside, but be warned it is no great literature by any means. Will make a good screenplay though."
1,A literary letdown,"I decided to read this book because I saw the movie trailer and it looked like a lovely summer read. Do not be fooled! Go, see the movie and do not be lured into reading this book. The premise is clich√© and everything that Allie and Noah say to each other has been said a million times over. The dialogue has no flow and no creativity. Sparks uses the phrase, ""God (damn) he/she looked good"" to describe how Allie and Noah felt when they see one another, so many times, that it becomes a laugh. He has no other way of describing what each character feels. After reading this, I needed to read ""Gone with the Wind"",-immediately-a real love story, that doesn't insult your intelligence. There is a reason why some books and some authors transcend the ages, we can read those books and be transported to a different world each time. This book has none of those qualities. Sparks and this piece of ""literature"" will be forgotten, and it will not matter."
1,"A potentially meaningful story made simple, sappy, pitiful","A book written to appeal to an audience of shmucks who have no knowledge of great literature. Perhaps a great reading primer for kindergarteners, minus the sex scene. It made me think, I bet this is the kind of stuff that makes up those grocery store novels with Fabio gracing the covers. Characters so one-dimensional, the movie rights will probably be for a cartoon."
2,Sorely Disappointing,"I bought this book with high expectations - every review I'd read said how wonderful it is. Now, I'm embarassed to admit that I bought it! It's poorly written - elementary, really - and is a cookie-cutter love story. I felt no bond with the characters, and although I did cry while reading the last chapter it was because I related Allie's illness with that of my late grandfather, rather than because I really cared about them. My advice to those considering buying this book: save the cash and buy something really worthwhile, like Diving Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood."
2,A disappointment,"I read this book as a part of a book club. A big part of the group was still teary-eyed over it, but to me it was a big disappointment! I'd define this book as ""fluff"".Although the significance and the suffering that Alzheimer's brings cannot be debated, the development of the characters was weak. I typically do not find a book that is this quick & fast reading to have any significance to me. Just because it causes you cry or stir your emotions does it make for a work of genius."
2,Not much of a story.,"This isn't the worst book I've read, but I can't understand why it's been a bestseller so long. There's hardly any story here.I'm not unromantic, and the love between the main characters is sweet and enduring, but that's not enough to make this a good book.I was 14 pages from the end and had no trouble waiting a day to finish it. Actually, the only thing that got me through the whole book was to see what the big deal was. And I still don't know. Sorry, Nicholas."
1,truly mediocre,"Yikes! How can so many seemingly bright readers fall for this maudlin and implausible tale of sex on the deathbed? Friends with whom I have agreed on many other books told me would love it, warned me to keep tissues nearby.... tissues unnecessary except to stifle my alternating giggling and gagging. Probably the best thing I can say about this book is that it's marginally better than Bridges of Madison County: the worst thing? That it's sophomoric and maybe little bit gross. That final image actually made me say, ""Eeuww!"" Yucky.No, wait -- here's the worst thing I could say: It was obviously written with a movie in mind. Maybe the movie will actually be better in the same way Bridges made for a better film than novel."
1,Plenty of corn and schmaltz,"I marvel at the way people have given this work more than one star. The sentimentality oozes out of the writing and often, for want of anything better to contribute, the author continues to dwell on small mundane scenes...The book is a shallow and inept endeavor to capture a love story and lacks the talent of a true artisan of the craft of writing."
2,Hmmm...,"Yeah, I didn't get the hype about this book. It was lent to me with the command of ""read it with a box of tissues."" The only way I would cry would be because of boredom and sincere disappointment. For a book that is considered so ""moving"" I found that it lacked anything to actually move. It's one thing to write a short story and be done with it, but another thing to try to rush through and make a story short. To me the story was a good one, but the way it was written made this book an empty vase. See the movie; it's a better way to get the story and not waste your time."
1,Barely Got to Page 50,"I started to read The Notebook book only because my neighbor forced it upon me, and I had to stop at page 50. I know that since I am not a romantic person, it was not a good idea to read it, but i wanted to please my neighbor, so i tried and, believe me I TRIED to finish it (or AT LEAST get to page 100)! Nicholas Sparks' writing style horrified me! I felt I was reading a C-students narrative in Junior High!I can now fully understand why a lot of his books are made into movies; many directors and writers are looking for a book that they won't have to rewrite to make a movie. I felt like I was reading a script, it was all dialogue and actions, and, oh yeah, more ACTIONS! He was barely able to describe anything at all! I will never again read a book by Nicholas Sparks, or even let alone THINK about doing it!"
5,"This book was great , and I recommend it to everyone.","To start off with I'm not much of a reader, but I had to read a novel for school. My teacher highly recommend this great book, and so did my mom, so I decided that maybe I should just start it and see if I liked it. Amazingly, I could not put this book down. I'm only 15 years old, with a very busy social life and I sat down and read this book over a period of only one weekend. The Note Book is filled with so much passion and romance. It wasn't hard to read but it was very intricate and creative. I told some of my friends about this book and I got about 3 or 4 people interested in reading it as well. The whole plot of this story is so sweet and compassionate. People that read this book will see the way that love is meant to be. This book has inspired me to read more love stories, and just to read more."
1,predictable and sappy.,"The characters were perfect, the setting perfect, the storyline so predictable and unbelievable. I had to go to the dentist after this too sugary sweet read!"
1,This book is a waste of time to read.,"This book came highly recommended from a friend. I, however,don't think I have ever been so disappointed with a book, particularlygiven all the hype surrounding it... The plot was sappy, but I could have dealt with that had the writing been of at least a decent quality. It was not. He overdoes the detail, uses trite language and has no ""flow"" to his words and sentences... I would not recommend this book to anyone..."
5,A Great Love Story,"I read this book on vacation while on the beach...and it's the best book I have read in ages! Being in a romantic relationship myself, I was able to relate to all the feelings wrapped up in this book. For anyone who loves a great love story will really enjoy this. I couldn't put the book down for a second...I was getting goosebumps just reading it!"
4,"""The Notebook""",I ordered the book fom Amazon.com. It arrived in the time they promised . I was statified with the purchase.
4,The Notebook,"I was expecting the newer version of the book, but other than that, it was in fine condition."
2,"Great Service, Not So Great Book","I recieved the book just fine, but I didn't enjoy reading it that much. However, the sequel to this book, The Wedding, is a really good book that I would give 4 stars."
4,Fine love story,Obviously NP has the gist to write love stories. This one is good albeit it has its ups and downs. As many of his books you can read this this one in a long flight or in a tranquil day at the beach.
2,"Sparks' ""Best""","In the summer of '32, Noah and Allie meet and quickly fall head-over-heels in love. But somehow, at the end of the summer, the two are separated and lose contact. After 14 years they meet again. Will their love overcome the barriers between the two. You betcha. And it's all rather touching, even overwrought at times. So far nothing new, and, indeed, from my perspective nothing worthwhile.The last portion of the book, however, fast-forwards to the modern day. Our protaganists have now aged and one is in the grips of Alzheimer's. The love story continues. This portion of the book too is sacharine. It is not nearly so hackneyed, though.Even though, in my opinion, this book is not worth reading, it is by far Sparks' best and the only of his novels that displays any inventiveness."
5,Incredible!,"Anyone who gave this book a low rating either doesn't have a heart or isn't a true romantic. I read this book over a weekend and could not put it down! I was still crying a half hour after finishing it. This book has been passed around to my friends and they all feel the same way. Call it trite without much ""stuff"", but it's still nice to know that true love always wins."
5,not your run-of-the-mill affair...,"Read the Notebook in 55 minutes. devouring each luscious word. Knew from the second noah wrote allie about 10,000 years, they were destined to be together. Read in paperback, and enjoyed the texture of the cover itself. I know, now, the meaning of perfect love and the feeling of being home."
2,What is the big deal about this book?,"This is the first and only book that I would say just watch the movie. I don't like the book, in reality, I really didn't love the movie. Too sad, too depressing and sappy. I really struggled to keep reading the book. I think it jumps around too much and is really s.l.o.w. I just don't get why it was on the best seller list for so long. This is the third book written by Nicholas Sparks that I have read, and I think it will be the last."
2,My teeth ache,I finally got ahold of this book that I have been hearing so much about. I read it in one sitting...(not real difficult to do). I thought it was pretty bad. Much too sweet and cloying. I prefer books that have to do with REALITY
4,Yesss,"loved it. I love the movie, always have, just read the book for the first time. It's an easy, good read."
4,"A quick, thought provoking, enjoyable read!","I, too, couldn't put it down. It made me laugh, it made me cry, it made me think. It was a bit mushy in places, but the romantic in me won out and I recommend this book to the romantic in you."
2,"Too Cliche, Terrible Ending","The worst ending of any book I've ever read. I think the only reason I finished this was because I'd seen the movie and I thought it HAD to get better at some point. For someone who has had a love like that portrayed in the book, I was excited to have this grand finale of their final union...the movie captured this MUCH better than this poorly written book."
2,Not nearly as good as the movie,"I saw the movie version of The Notebook, which I loved, before I read the book, and I expected the book to be even better than the movie, since that's the way things usually are. But this is one of the few exceptions -- the trite, cliche-ridden book just doesn't even compare to the movie, which was very moving and romantic. I really congratulate whoever read the book and made that great movie out of it.If you haven't read the book yet, I would suggest just seeing the movie."
5,If you've ever loved and been loved you'll love this story,"As I read the book it made me think of a love of my youth, the love I have present day and the intense love I hope someone will feel for me in the end. I cryed so much from middle to end I could hardly read the pages. I gave it to a girlfriend with a note that in the end said ""Yes, I know its only a book"" - Well written and it really makes your think!!"
4,This one stays with you.,"When I first starting reading this novel, I thought it would be just another love story, but it wasn't; it was a powerful piece that juxtaposes youth and old age in a unique and magical way. I highly recommend this book. It's style is simple, but its content depicts (as Noah says what his father taught him and what he teaches us,) ""What matters."""
2,Boring,"However, the sequal, ""The Wedding"" is soooo bad I couldn't even finish it. It was disappointing because I really enjoyed ""The Lucky One."""
4,Good Deal,"I bought this book for only a few dollars, and it is not so bad. It was advertised as ""Used-Like New"" but, it's not like new at all.. It was more like, ""Used-acceptable"". None of the pages are torn, but, it seems a little bit water damaged. I'm glad the spine of the book is not destroyed though. All in all, a good buy. Better than paying full price.The book is VERY different from the movie, so don't get it expecting it to be like it though."
5,"A wonderfully written,truly touching love story!",I read this book in two nights! My dad (75 years old) read this book outloud to my mom while she was in the hospital. They both loved it and my father actually teared up in a few places! I've never even heard my father say he's read a romanctic book let alone being emotionally caught up in it! My mother loved it too! She had heard it had a horrible ending but agrees with me that it was a wonderful ending! Its truly a touching story for any age!
4,Darn good,"Sparks is a great writer and has made another great book. I found the book, easy to get in to and didn't have a hard time picking up on the characters at all. He also makes the pace a bit slower, just as a mature love would be and how older characters interact.He also, gives us two points of view in one chapter, one paragraph, something unique but can often confuse. I didn't enjoy the concept but he did it quite well. When you are seeing and feeling what one character is feeling , you suddenly in the other characters head.My only other faults with the books were the sequence with Allie's fianc√©e. He seemed to just read minds for a moment or two there and just knew his lady was going cheating on him. This is a distraction. You think he will show up, cause a scene, yet in the end, he is a tool, for her choice.Reading the book, and really getting into the ending, one can't help but think about the terms To Death Do Us Part."
3,A quick read,"I'm another one surprised to find myself thinking, ""the movie was better."" The book was okay. It was a short enough book that I dont feel I wasted my time. The most emotional parts were of the old couple, just the sad lot they had in their old age, not even so much the connected love story. The end was cheesy."
1,movie was better,not impressed with the book. I thought the movie version did a better job with the story and the characters.
2,I found this book lacking...,"When I first started reading The Notebook, I fell in love with the writing style. Although at first the story line held my attention, later I found that I couldn't wait for it to be over. I understood Noah's character, and felt his love for Allie. But Allie's character wasn't developed well, and her love for Noah seemed only slight. Just when you think you finally get to find out what happened, the story just stops and leaves you hanging. I can appreciate the mystery, but there was no climax in this book at all. I was not excited to read it, and I was not sorry that it ended. It was not a page-turner."
3,easy reading - nice story,"I have to recognize I read the book in two days. The story catches you and you cannot put the book down. You can almost feel what is happening to Allie, and worry about what desicion she will take, and feel sad about Noah... I've been reading more ""serious"" books latelt tough. Vietnam war, etc. and it seem a little too romantic for my taste. It is a book to entratain yourself a while, a romantic novel."
3,my girlfriend had me read it...,"we saw the movie, and then she had me read the book. i've read many books, but this one was one of the few i didn't like. the film seemed more indepth and brought out the story more than the book (to me at least), which is rare. others may disagree, but this is how i felt about it."
4,The Notebook (Novel),"This book came in Perfect condition and in good time. However, the cover was different than the one shown, and I bought it for the picture becuase I already have a papwerback version of this story. Oh, well. At least it was still one version of the movie covers."
5,Fabulous!!,"I normally don't go for these mushy love story type books, but I loved this. I couldn't put it down. I can't wait to read The Wedding, the sequel."
2,"Mildly Entertaining But Ultimately Boring ""Chick Lit""","I found the first half of ""The Notebook"" mildly entertaining but was bored and kind of grossed-out by the second half. I can't say too much without giving away key plot points, but suffice it to say that I think most men will be pretty bored by the book. For a much better book by Nichaolas Sparks check out ""A Walk to Remember"""
1,Are You Serious?,"I read The Notebook in 8th grade for a book report. Soon after I found out what a mistake that would be. The charachters are entirely run of the mill and the plot is totally unbeliveable and predictable. The only time something slightly changed in the whole story was when you read about the two charachters reuniting. Although I was happy to finally get to a bit of a change form the book, I'm not sure thats the kinda of change I was looking for, whcih was a full on description of the two having intercourse. Pretty much, this book consists of: balh, blah,,blah, sex, balh balh blah, sex. I cant understand why this book was so highly praised, but I would strongly reccomend not reading it. Its a whole lot of nothing rolled up into 200 pages."
5,The book is better than the movie,"My dad first told me about this book. It sounded like a good old fashioned love story. I bought it before, loaned it and never got it back it was so good. So I bought it again. After this came out, Reader's Digest had a short story to continue on with Noah through the years. The sequel The Wedding, is about their children. I loved the book and only mildly enjoyed the movie. I own all Nicholas Sparks books, he is an amazing author, all his books have a different lesson on love."
2,"Can you say ""contrived""?","Yes, it's a tear-jerker and a reader isn't supposed to be too picky, but give me a break. The woman's fiance is your typical WASPy bore, and our hero is such a man's man. He builds, he cares, he cries!And the ending is ridiculous. A better title would be ""When We Were Pimps."""
4,A sad but lovely love story!,I truly enjoyed this heartwarming story. Everyone should be so lucky as to share this kind of love in their lifetime. You can't read this one without a box of tissues.
3,It is something I would recommend for my mother.,"I just got finished reading this book and I didn't think that it was that bad but, it wasn't that good either. I mean it is the kind of book my mother would read or something I would recommend for her. I thought that it was heart-felt, and it did make me cry in some places in the book. The only problem I have with this book is, ""Where are you going to find a love like that in real life?"""
5,Amazing,"This story is way different than the movie, so even if you saw the movie first the book is still great<3 <3 loved it!!!!"
3,A sweet and poetic waltz,"I picked up ""The Notebook"" on a whim. I'd heard good things about it, but it was only a hundred pages or so, it looked like it was worth checking out. I sat down and finished the book in a little over an hour. It is an extremely quick read, and you don't want to stop. The words flow seamlessly and the story pans out like a sweet and poetic waltz, which takes you off into never never land. While in the end, it wasn't very fufilling, and parts of it were farfetched, it served it's purpose and was an interesting read, never boring. I did wonder a couple of times about the time period, because it seemed that towards the beginning, Sparks forgot the story took place in the 40's...because the characters and their actions were so 90'sish. It's definitely worth your time and you probably won't regret reading it."
2,The story really didn't go anywhere.,I was disappointed in this book since I had heard good things about it. If you like love stories than maybe you would like this book. I found the story to be very lame and it never really took off. I did finish the book but I found myself thinking blah blah blah just get to the end of the story so I can start another book.
4,a beautiful love story that even a man can enjoy,I don't usually read this type of book but I was hooked when I read the first page. I laughed and cried while reading this touching account of true love.
1,the stupidist book I've ever read,"I'm a junior in high school, and I checked this book out because people (including my english teacher) kept gushing about it. I truly wanted to like this book. After about thirty pages, I began to feel slightly nauseated, but read the whole thing, hoping it might redeem itself. No such luck. This book is such a waste of time that I actually feel annoyed with the people who gave it good reviews. It is full of cliches, and very poorly written. It is predictable, and sappy, and unbelievable. I would have to say it's one of the worst books I've ever read. Don't waste your time!"
2,[Poorly Written],"I will admit that the beginning and end of this book may work pretty well in rousing some emotions, but everything inbetween is tripe. Most of it is so cliche that I actually rolled my eyes and groaned out loud. The descriptive passages throughout the middle section the book were very unimaginative and timeworn. They actually made my eyes hurt. After struggling to get to the end (which was pretty good) I couldn't supress the thought that two very different writers worked on this book. The idea behind the story was good, but too bad the author didn't hone his writing skills better before tackling it. I would never classify this as literature. It's just too poortly written."
1,"Too Man ""Gods"" in This Drivel","I made it as far as page 49 and then I threw the book on the floor because of cliches like the following:""But God, those eyes."" --pg 40.I cringed but read on. Then I came across another!""God, he looked good."" --pg 49My God, Sparks's writing blows!The movie was so good, it inspired me to read the book. This is one of those rare cases in which the movie is better."
5,Beautiful! Loved it for the simplicity of its complexity.,"It seems from the reviews I read, that readers either loved the book or hated it. Personally, I loved it. Yes, it was an easy read and may have been grammatically simplistic but the emotions that Nicolas Sparks evokes is masterful. I felt the plot was unique for love stories and was a refreshing change of pace from the ""heat of the moment"" love stories on the market. If you are not a true romantic find something else to read."
4,"The Review of The Book ""The Notebook""","This book was hard to put down. Little surprises kept popping up making the reader not put it down. The main character, Noah Calhoun, is very adventerous. He likes to go canoeing and play the guitar. Allison Nelson was the other main character. Her enjoyment comes from painting. Noah and Allison spent a summer together and fell in love. They haven't seen each other since. Since not having met in about five years, this book is very suspensful. When Allison comes back to meet Noah, they fall in love with each other all over again. This part of the book is very suspensful. I find myself asking, ""Will they fall in love again?"" or ""Will they marry some day?"" I couldn't wait to finish the book to find out if they stay together. I give this book an eight rating out of ten. It was a good book but some parts were dragging."
2,THE REVIEW,"I don't really like the book. Their love is not as meaningful to me as the book has described. The plot is good, but the author should've made it more of a tragedy instead of a happy ending. I don't like when Laura came back to him and then they stayed together. The author should just leave the story when Laura left to get marry with Leon. To me their love doesn't seem stable. I would like it more if he change the end and maybe have one of the main characters die. It may be lame, but it's unexpected. It would be more emotional and remembering."
1,Save me from books like this,"What terrible, terrible writing. Vapid, hollow, trite--I could go on, but mere adjectives fail to capture the bounds of my distaste. i'd rather read a magazine. Or a blog. Or a roll of toilet paper. With so many great books out there in the literary canon, please take my advice and avoid this formulaic trash. If you're just that curious, watch the movie--running time two hours instead of 8 in front of a forgettable book."
3,Eh...,"I liked the book just OKAY. I dont think there is a time i have EVER said this, but i like the movie much better. I thought i would be balling like i did in the movie, but not a drop! i did finish the book so it did keep my attention, but it wasnt what i expected."
1,Total deception.... the movie is better.,"I bought the book thinking that the book was going to be as good as the movie, but it's not.It was so bad that I want my money back!!! The book starts when Allie wants to meet Noah. That's about when the movie is almost over. The book doesn't really tell the story of Noah and Allie together. They remember of bits and things and that's about it. The book also is kind of boring. I had a hard time reading it, because Noah says something and then they walk for a long time and then she answers or they gaze at the sun or the trees for a long time and then they talk or they are comfortable with silence... It's a boring novel."
3,Good love story.,"The actual story was good, but was lacking in details. Would have liked more explanation on some issues. Not bad for his first novel. Will read the next one."
3,The notebook,I was disappointed that the book was so different from the movie. I also felt that the movie portrayed their love and passion for one another in a much greater way than could ever be experienced through just reading this book.
2,Not as great as I expected,"I'm a person who usually loves a book more than the movie version, but in this case the movie was SO much better than the book. Unfortunately I watched the movie before the book so I was incredibly disappointed when I read this, it just didn't get into there past and how they fell in love enough for my liking. It's still a touching story, I just didn't enjoy it."
5,WONDERFUL,"I thought this book was very heartwarming, a great read for anyone looking for a quick read as well as a romantic tale..."
5,True love always prevails!,"This story shows that love and destiny are partners. Noah and Allison have what almost every woman dreams of and yearns for, genuine love. The book is a definite page turner, so make sure you have time to read the entire book once you begin!"
4,Simple love story,"This is a simple love story. A true tear jerker, I admit. I was crying so hard at the end I couldn't see the pages. This is not a book to be analyzed, (I agree with the others), it is just a book to enjoy."
1,An utter waste of intellectual time,"Sparks' book is trite, predictable and completely one dementional. Granted, I love the idea of true love and its ability to survive in modern times, but I also read for enriching dialogue, convincing charaters, and original thoughts into matters that so many authors have already contemplated. This book just doesn't cut it."
4,Nice Romance,The Notebook by Nicholas SparksGreat romantic book that keeps your interest. Very easy read in a short time.Would recommend it.
2,The Notebook-nothing to write home about,Friends had suggested I read The Notebook and told me how good it was. I didn't particularly love it and found it a bit corny.
2,I liked the movie better...who says that?,"I enjoyed the movie much more than the book. That said, I thought the book was just ok. I don't get what all the hype was about. It is a short book, but it fell short in my opinion."
4,Need a good cry?,"I read this book in one sitting. I started crying around page 95, and didn't stop until about half an hour after I'd finished. It's like the author had all my buttons (true love, alzheimers, the South)lined up in a row and pushed them hard. Sure this book is schmaltzy, sure it's no great work of lit-rit-ture, but it is a great read if you want a good cry."
5,you won't put it down!,"I bought this book in the airport in LA. I finished it as we pulled up to the gate in Atlanta. Perhaps the greatest love story ever told. I can't imagine writing a bad review about this book. And for those who did, you are missing something special in life."
1,harlequin / blue-light special,"While the love story in this book is beautiful, the story was so predictable that it was ultimately boring. Lucky for the reader the author limited the length. Please keep in mind that this comment comes from a reader who is very tired of the my-father-killed-my-puppy-when-I-was-ten-psycho-babble that dominates so many novels today. I like to read happy novels...I just didn't fnd any substance in this one."
4,Poo poo to the naysayers!,I thought this book was an excellent love story! A fast read that I read on an airplane while flying across the country. It captured my heart and that's what's important to me. I think most people would love this story!
5,Notebook Review,The notebook was a book about a girl Allie Nelson and her boyfriend Noah Calhoun. They met at a carnival in 1946. That summer they were never separated. If you saw them they would be together. But one summer day Allie's parents told her they were going back to there house. Allie was devastated that she had to leave Noah. But everyday for 1 year Noah wrote her a letter and sent it. Allie's mother would get the mail adn take the letters so Allie would forget about him. Then Noah rebuilt a house and Allie saw it in the newspaper and decited to go back to that small North Carolina town to see Noah again. before she left she got engaged to a wealthy lawyer. When she got there Noah took Allie on the lake so they could talk. Then it started to rain when they got back to the dock they were being really flirty and soon enough they fell in love again. The next day Allie's mom came and said she wasn't going to stop her. Allie didn't marry the lawyer. And they lived happy FOREVER!!!
4,The Notebook,"The Notebook is one of my favorite stories. I truly recommend this book to the people that like romance and love stories. This story will make you cry and fall in love at the same time. This story will keep you reading, and reading, because you will want to know what's going to happen next. I also watched the movie of this story, but I enjoyed, and liked the book best."
5,Makes me wish I was in the story,"Nicholas sparks has a way of making you feel like you in the story, not just reading to pass time. This amazing story of Allie and Noah is wonderful...not only do they fall in love once and get ripped apart, but they find their love all over again, more than once!This is one of my favorite stories now, that I intend to reread often...If you think the book is good you should see the movie, it's even better+it helps you add faces to the characters!Buy it you won't be sorry!!!!!!"
3,Classic love story,"The Notebook has been called one of those classic love stories, and it is one.Most people find themselves rooting for Noah (the poor boy).Like most stories social class comes in the middle of their relationship. Allie's the rich girl. Who grew up with money and is expected to marry it. Noah's the working class small town boy who sweeps her off her feet. They spend one summer together, after which they lose touch. Well-wishing parents, misinterpreted feelings, and World war II keep them apart. Then certain circumstances calls for Allie to come back to New Bern, there she encounters Noah again.I think this was a good book you really feel the dilemma Allie's going through. Whether to do what her parents want for her or follow her heart. You also feel for Noah as he has to face losing her all over again. You'll like this book especially if your into romance novels."
3,The movie is actually better this time...,"Normally I prefer books to movies because they offer more insight into the characters, their lives, and the story in general. But not this time. Sparks' books have a shallow, Lifetime Movie Network feel to me. Shocking twists, plot holes, one in a million happenings...just not realistic.However, the movie was absolutely wonderful. I saw it four times in the theater (normally a movie isn't worth $7.50 to me, but I love The Notebook and had to go see it with everyone!) and cried every time. The movie offers a more ""realistic"" and passionate view of Noah and Allie's love story."
5,Heart-breakingly beautiful!,"I've read this book 3 times, and I still cried. Simple, sweet, heart-renderingly beautiful. A true love story. This one is for keeps."
4,A nice change !!!!!,"While I may not be a literary genious, I truly enjoyed this book. This was not an unrealistic story as was the story of my own grandparents. Those who are skepitcal about ""true love"" and ""In sickness and in health"" will not appreciate this book, for those who have lived it, a must read novel. It inspires hope of ""forever"". I enjoyed this book and have passed it on."
5,A Wonderful Love Story!,This has to rank among my favorite books of all time. Never before have I had any book touch me in this way. I cried for the last one-hundred pages. Definitely read this book if you want to be swept away in a heartwarming love story.
4,Get out your tissues!,"I first thought the book was too sappy and almost gave up. But then, Noah is reading from his journal to his wife Allie who is elderly and who has Alzheimer's disease. They are together now in the same nursing home. This is when you'll get to weeping unless you've got no pulse. A great book from there to the end."
2,A good beach read...at best.,"This book didn't leave me crying, or even feeling attached to the characters, and I consider myself a fairly emotional and romantic person. The book was too short to really feel anything for the characters. Any true depth or believability I found myself feeling at times was always hindered by Spark's horrid writing style. I found myself cringing from time to time over the sentences and words he chose; it was that out of a pre-teen novel. The dialouge was all too contrived and unrealistic. I could see myself really enjoying this book if I were fourteen or younger, but for the older reader, just take it for what it is: a quick and easy read for the beach. Nothing you'll want to reread or cherish, but it's entertaining for a few hours."
4,A TRUE love story,"I read this book in a few hours. I couldn't put it down. Although, some may say this is a predictable plot the book's real gift is the last fifty pages. It's Noah's enduring love for Allie past their ""perfect summer"" that makes you cry. Someone said they wanted more written on their past and that would be a mistake. Reading how Nicholas Sparks wrote how Allie and Noah were afer 40 years of marriage is what makes their love a rare and true love.I would NOT read this after a break-up or if you are yearning for someone."
1,predictable romance,"If you want to read a book that has no excitement and no depth or meaning then you should read The Notebook. Kudos to Sparks for writing a book with a plot that has been used many times before and actually receiving praise for it. I was extremely disappointed with the ending. The writing style was easy to read, but how it was set up in some parts made it confusing about who the author was referring to. I have not seen the movie but I heard good things about it. After reading the book I want to see the movie just to see what all the hype was about."
2,Blecccch!,"Absolutely nauseating. I read the whole thing, hoping it would turn around, but no! Gotta give the guy credit, though, he's got millions hooked. I've read better romance on notes passed in high school."
1,"""like new""condition i dont think so",this book looked like everyone in the US had had it first it was old worn out and the pages were yellowing i would never order from them again
2,do not read this book,"I already wrote one review advising people not to buy the book. The writing is bad, the characters are boring, the story is trite. It is the second-worst book I ever read. The only reason it got 2 stars instead of 1 is that the final segment was somewhat charming. I explained why. People then proceed to accuse my review of being not helpful. It's not supposed to help decide TO buy the book, but NOT TO buy the book. It's a bad book, trust me! Are only positive reviews helpful ones? Look and see how many others wrote the same thing I did! I'm trying to save you a few bucks here. If you MUST read it, check it out from the library. Don't spend money on this crap. You want to read some good southern literature - read Lee Smith, Pat Conroy, Fred Chappell, numerous others. Stay away from Nicholas Sparks. He still has some maturing to do as a writer. The book reads like an *average* high schoolers creative writing assignment."
1,Ugh! Ugh! Ugh!,"I am shocked that Nicholas Sparks continues to sell any novels at all, considering how appallingly bad this and his other books are.His plots are formulaic and his most complex character is scarcely two dimensional. Compared to this dreck, even a Danielle Steel novel seems brilliant and complex. It's so obvious that Sparks is going for the obvious tear-jerker, and no amount of schmaltz is too much in this quest. Save your money and your time."
3,Not that wonderful,"After seeing the movie I fell in love with the characters. I thought the book would bring more life to them and I would get to know them even better, because books do that, right? Well, I couldn't find it at the library for nearly 2 months, so I read two other of his books first. They really let me down. He writes a corny love story to toy with your emotions to sell books. I felt like I was reading a story a Freshman in High School would write. After reading the Notebook I was again saddened at his lack of writing abilities. He writes plain, no depth or soul or passion can I find in his characters. Yes, they have sex, so he writes about their passion for each other, which is easy to do, but he did not write the characters themselves to come alive. I think the third time's the charm for me... I will not read any more of his books. They are not getting any better for me, and I dearly love a good book!"
2,Well the last few pages are worth while,I do not like Sparks' writing style but the way he puts the last sequence of the book about Allie and her husband's love at old age was so... well beautiful. It can easily be compared to Nancy and Ronald Reagan. Getting old is expensive when it is a loved one you are losing. I hate most of the book but the last few pages are timeless.
1,"Sappy, Overrated, poorly written mess","Someone hold out a hefty bag for me to vomit in. Now, dont get me wrong, i love a good romance novel, love a well put together story full of historical content, good descriptions and believable dialogue this book has none of that. A lake full of freaking white birds? kissing in the rain? True love being divided by class lines/war/Fiancees? UNORIGINAL AND SAPPY. What kills me is that people rave about it. Save your time (although it took me all of an hour to get through this 5th grade prose) and read a real romantic novel like ""the bronze horseman"" if you want all the themes but no drippy assuming crappola."
2,Another Cheesy Book?,"Honestly, do we need another book where you don't actually have to read anything because you already know what's going to happen? While reading The Notebook, I felt like I could have written every single word in ever single sentence. I asked some girls from my work what they thought about it and they loved it. It is a feel good novel that makes you wish everything was so perfect all the time, but get real. I guess there is something to say for love stories and happy endings, they never happen, but it's fun to pretend. If this is your thing, go for it."
2,Too much perfection,"A truly great love story should be about real people with real faults and real warts. Sparks writes his story about handsome Noah who reads poetry, works incredibly hard, communes with natures, and loves intensely and steadfastly. Allie is incredibly beautiful and soulful (or so we are told, although we are shown no evidence of it) and a tremedously talented artist. The first half of the book is told with all the depth of a fairy tale. What isn't fairy tale is cliche. There's even a scene where they are caught in the rain and he can't help but notice her erect nipples protruding against her wet dress. The second half becomes slighter better, but is marred by the same lack of reality. Allie is still perfect, even in her old age and disease. Her memory is her only deficit. There is no real substance here, just lovely fluffy cotton candy."
1,Could this book be more trite?,"Terrible. Predictable. Intelligence insulting. Though true love can last a lifetime, teenaged passion cannot. And true love can not cure Alzheimer's - even in romantic fiction the premise is unbelievable. This book goes into the ""Hours of My Life I Will Never Get Back"" pile."
1,No literary merit,"What a disasterous novel!Sparks is a romance novelist at the most, but somehow a twist of fate not only netted him tons of dollars of sappy movie earnings but also boosted his status to a serious writer. While the movies are tolerable and even touching at moments, the books, however, are a manifestion of juvenile use of figurative language nested in badly-formed sentences that simply don't flow together."
1,Worse romantic novel I've ever read,"Hands down, this is the worst romantic novel I've ever read. The narrative was stiff, unnatural, almost painful to read. The dialog was at times unbelievable, at times simply awful. The plot was poorly developed and the characters, especially the female lead, were ridiculous. There was nothing even remotely romantic even in the romantic moments! In contrast, the movie, which I saw a few days after reading the book, was very nice."
1,A most contrived notebook indeed. Fail!,"I'm a male reader who reads and enjoys romance. With much interest did I pick this book, only to disappointed. This book belongs to the garbage heap along with Waller, folks. The story is most contrived and shallow. There is (a) no chemistry between hero and heroine, (b) no humour, (c) contrived dialogues reminiscent of a grade three essay book, (d) flat descriptions of people, (e) mawkish melodrama being passed off as poignant drama. Take my advice, ignore the other '10' reviews and get this from a library instead."
5,A love story for a lifetime,I cried my eyes out. What a story. I am thrilled that one can speak so honestly of love. A lesson in patience and understanding. beautifully written.
3,The Story is Amazing (3.5),"Yes, I think the actual story is amazing and wonderful and did make me teary eyed. However, the reason i'm only giving it 3.5 stars is because I felt that nearing the end, it read like a hallmark card. I thought that the dialogue between the characters were unrealistic and had me rolling my eyes at how cheesy it actually sounded. If you at least sort of liked this book, I would highly recommend the movie!"
4,a moving story,You can say that this book is over the top on romance but there is no doubt that it makes you feel good. We are surrounded by cynicism and the emotions stirred by the story of Noah and Ali are touching and heartfelt. It makes you wish for happy ever after.
3,eh.,"This isn't a great book. Heck, this isn't even a great romance novel. If you're looking for a quick, predictable, emotional little romance, this is the book for you. The ending was just too sappy for me but a lot of people like that kind of thing. I finished it in roughly two hours so it's perfect for a summer afternoon at the beach but not one to treasure."
5,The Notebook,"As I read this beautifully written book I could see Robert Redford playing the part of the dashing hero. It not only left me with a feeling of serenity, but also renewed my belief in love lasting forever. No matter what the challenges love will always continue to survive. Should this book ever be made into a movie (and I believe it should be), then it would definetly find itself in my collection. Nicholas Sparks is a wonderful writer who takes his readers on a ride where one experiences every emotion available."
4,True Love Does exist!!,"I read this book in one day. I just had to find out what happened to Noah and Allie. This is the first book to ever make me cry. In a world of broken hearts and relationships ending so quickly, The Notebook reminds us of the power of true love. Two people who are in love are never really separated. This is Nicholas Sparks' greatest book!!"
5,SUPERB GREAT BOOK,"The NOTEBOOK is a superb good book I couldn't put it down. It is a beautiful story about great love. Nicholas Sparks knows how to get to our emotions. Bravo Nicholas. I have read Message in a Bottle, A bend in the Road, The Guardian and now I'll read The Wedding. I have never been disappointed in any of your books."
3,Somehow dated. It's more a collection of personal stories.,"Although this book is fine for the layman who wants to learn something about the North African campaign of 1941-43 it is not good for the scholars or anyone who wants to study the battles in that theater in greater depth. Carell uses many personal histories to color his account but he often loses the great picture. I would recommend instead Mitcham's book ""Rommel's Greatest Victory"", Heckmann's ""Rommel's War in Africa"", Irving's ""The Trail of the Fox"", Massignani's ""Rommel's North Africa Campaign"" or even the excellent Time-Life volume ""Afrikakorps"" from the ""Third Reich"" series."
5,the most amazing shoe i've ever had,"this is truly the best shoe i've ever bought, and trust me, i've had em all, nike, brooks, nb etc etc. THIS IS NOT JUST FOR TRAIL RUNNING. i use mine on trails and on the street and the shoe does great on both. i got these after having these recommended to me by a guy at galyans after i explained that my knees sometimes played up after a lacrosse injury. these shoes just make it a pleasure to run. really chushiony, totally eliminated my knee pains, great grip when i do go on the trails! would totally recommend these to anyone. my friend borrowed them yesterday and was so impressed that she's going to get herself a pair today!"
4,Good Frame,"It was nice to find a sports frame that actually fits in with a home or office setting instead of a game room setting, while still showing team support. Great frame for putting an autograph in!"
2,major disappointment,"I bought this title because the one I really wanted, ""Cast Your Fate To The Wind"" is not generally available. Believe me when I say this title bears no resemblance to that one. It is cheesy, corny, and not enjoyable on any seriously musical level. Be advised."
2,Not the good old music,"If you happen to be like me and love that scratchy old music then you may not like this one. Its the newer recordings and his voice doesn't sound the same as it did in his hayday. Try Heigh-Ho Everybody, This Is Rudy Vallee, for the old stuff.....Happy Listening! :}"
1,Misleading,"The cover picture on the CD indicated early Rudy but this was a mismash of the decades. If the cuts had been chronological it would have been better but they weren't and there are no liner notes indicating when any of the songs were recorded. If you want 50s Rudy you're better off getting As Time Goes By a 56 reissue or Heigh-ho everybody this is Rudy Vallee, it contains cuts from 28-30 which is my favorite."
4,Useful Rhetoric Handbook and Grammar Review.,I have a copy of the 1950 edition of Perrin's Guide (it was my mom's college textbook) and find it very useful. It is well-organized and gives good advice on how to write effective sentences and coherent paragraphs. It also discusses how to do research and take notes and write term papers. Makes a good companion to Warriner's English Grammar and Composition.
4,Pashto phrase book,"This is a good start as a translation and phrase book. I don't agree with all the transliterations they have in Pashto but don't worry - Pashtoons aren't shy about correcting you when it comes to their language. For my taste it has far too much ""tourist"" type phrases - when that country is far from a tourist area. All in all, it's a good book to have around for a quick word or a quick phrase."
3,Decent Phrasebook for anyone who needs it,"This book has many of the necessary phrases covered. As you will find in Pashto speaking areas, the language differs greatly from one area or another. You may find that using a phrase in this book will work in one village, but in another you will only get blank stares. The best thing to do is use this book and cross-reference with a translator. You will find that you can get a good grasp on the phrases and then fine tune your ability to use them with correct local phrases."
3,Pashto Dictionary & Phrasebook,This is an excellent dictionary and phrase book but I believe it can best be used by someone who already has a working knowldege of Pashto and not a beginner like myself.
2,Pashto Dictionary,"Dictionary is a decent but is missing many pashto words and only has roman letters. The back section of the book is for tourists, not very helpful for anyone traveling to Afghanistan through the military. I'm still looking for a more practical dictionary, one with pashto script."
4,Good,I bought this product thinking I would be able to use it and actually learn pashto being deployed to afghanistan but the only time I really see any locals is at the bazar and they mainly speak english to you and I tried speaking pashto to one of them and they said something and completely confused me...
2,Not very accurate.,I bought this book to go along with a military language training program. I am deploying to Afghanistan and was selected to learn pashto before the tour. Throughout my weeks of class we found that this book was highly inaccurate in translation and a large amount of this book is actually Dari not pashto.However there aren't many pashto English dictionaries out there so you have to take what you can get.
3,"Run, Simon, Run","I would normally rate this movie a 4 or 5, but the 3 rating reflects the disappointing quality of the DVD release. There have been other ""Made For TV"" movies such as ""Duel"" released on DVD with great quality. This release looks like it was transferred to DVD from an old film taped off a TV set. I purchased a VHS copy of this film some years ago and the quality was also very poor. So I was ecstatic to see it come to DVD with the promise of digital restoration. However, the end result is same poor quality only on DVD. Anyway, if your a fan of Burt Reynolds or Inger Stevens, I recommend adding this to your collection. Hopefully, this can be re-released in the future with better quality standards."
5,Great little Burt Reynolds made for TV movie finally on DVD!!!,"It's nice have this great little known made for TV movie on DVD!!! Okay,the picture and sound quality is not the greatest in the world,but this film is quite a rare find,so thats fine!!! It's a early Burt Reynolds performance and there's fine acting from James Best,Don Dubbins and Inger Stevens also!!! A obscure 70's gem!!! Two thumbs up!!! Five stars!!! A+"
1,ZE store is a rip off! never delivered product!,"Ze store is a rip-off- never delivered product- they sent us an empty package, we asked for them to actully ship the product we bought- but they never responded.Don't buy from them!!"
1,Poor Quality,The Card despatched does not stores photo's clearly. The first photo gets mixed with second or older photo and hence unable to see the photo's clearly.
5,Great deal!,"I still can't believe I got a 2 gig memory card for $38 including tax, AND an adapter as well. Amazing..."
1,Cant play it,"Got it for my nephew via amazon. turns out its for Xbox alone, not Xbox 360, which my nephew owns. Turns out Xbox games cant be played on Xbox 360 consoles! What a load of crap! The kid tried everything, even took it to his neighbor's place to try it there (also 360), but was disappointed. Now Im feeling guilty the kids in a mess!"
4,The Tolkien Reader for Tolkien fans.,"Like said before, this book is for already established fans of J.R.R. Tolkien. This book includes an essay about fairy stories and Tolkien's thoughts about what a fairy story is and is not. It was a slow read, but interesting to see into his mind and to discover his influences. The highlight of the book for me was the Farmer Giles of Ham. It was a well told story. The adventures of Tom Bombadil were good because it gives you some backstory of Tom. I'm not really a fan of Tom Bombadil, but you can appreciate the thought that Tolkien put into Bombadils poetry/stories. I really believe Bombadil was one of Tolkiens favorite characters."
3,"Inaccurate Description, No Fault of the Book","Be aware, this nice collection of some of J.R.R.T.'s shorter works does NOT--I repeat, does NOT--include his important essay ""On Fairy-Stories"" as described."
4,"The Vibe Tribe hits all green lights with ""Drive.""","This second release from The Vibe Tribe really shows a band headed in the right direction. The various influences of blues, rock and funk blend together to form a unique sound all their own. Particular notice must go to the song, ""Press On."" A gentle, loping track carried along by the incredible music and positive lyrics."
5,Sturdy and comfortable gardening shoes,"I've worn these for gardening and yardwork for almost a year now, and they have held up quite well. I generally take a size 7.5 in shoes; the size 7 here fits a little loosely without socks or just about perfect with socks. They have been comfortable to wear for hours at a time, and the sole is thick enough that I can stomp down a shovel without my feet crying for mercy like they were in my tennies. The low lip on the back had me worried about walking out of them, but it hasn't happened even once yet. If these fell apart tomorrow, I'd still happily buy another pair - but they don't look like they'll fall apart anytime soon!"
4,fantastic,"Like the shoes; fits well, seems durable and for the price should have bought 2 pairs. I well be using it this summer for backyard works. It is just a little bit heavy but for for the price i cannot complain much."
5,Comfortable and Durable - The Best Garden Clog!,"I purchased my first Sloggers 10 years ago and just got another pair, not to replace the old ones, but to have a second pair. You might think I don't wear them much, but I live in them at home three seasons out of the year. They are flexible enough to be comfortable yet strong and sturdy enough to use with a shovel or digging fork. I wear an 8.5 but got an 8 in these. When they arrived I thought they'd be too small, but the liner conforms to the foot and that takes a couple wearings. Now the new pair is just as comfortable as the old ones. There are few products in my life that I consider perfect for the job, so I mean it when I say these are the best!"
5,"Great outdoor, garden shoes!!","Very pleased. Even if covered in mud, after walking through grass, the mud just disappears, does not get caught in the creases easily. Was worried about the size. I wear a normal width 7 1/2, the 8's fit great, I think the 7's would be too small. They are comfortable and excellent for working in the garden or being out in the backyard after the grass has been mowed. Dry fast, if the insides get a little wet from dew, etc. Color is very nice and pleasing in person. I've been looking for these for awhile!"
4,Kiwi Sloggers brighten the day!,"I had a pair of these Sloggers for ten years.The soles are now worn smooth and are too slippery in the wet grass.I purchased this new pair at a price cheaper than the original pair. The new color selection was nice .Love the Kiwi green color.I originally purchased a Size 7 that was a bit small with a low cut sock. However the problem of not giving a five star rating enters here, as they are not available in half sizes.I usually wear a size 7 1/2The size eight is a bit too large but a heavier sock helps and my toes are not cramped after wearing all day.They are easily cleaned and look great for years.Much more supportive than other clogs.I am a Master Gardener and I love these Sloggers."
5,Just what I was looking for.,This was just what I wanted.......a clog type shoe without holes. Very strudy. I usually wear an 8 1/2....ordered a 9 and they fit well.
2,uncomfortable,too small although it was reported to be the same size as another brand shoe that did fit. returned it
2,"Larger than the same size in the ""shoe"" Slogger","I love the ""Garden Shoe"" that I purchased a couple of years ago but they needed replacing due to the fact that they stretched a bit and the footbed has some holes from wear. I purchased the ""clog"" in the same size but they clearly fit differently than the ""shoe."" They are wider and longer. I would not get the clog again. I'm sorry that I didn't stick to what I know and like."
5,Covers the feet,They fit and are comfortable and keep my feet dry little on the heavy side well made hard to find in my area
3,Sizing is a problem,"I bought a pair of the Kiwi Sloggers for my mom, who loves to garden. She wears a size 8 shoe, so I purchased the size 8. However, they were too small and cramped her toes, so now I have to return them and get a size 9, very frustrating! Please put an accurate size chart on the site, so that customers can choose the right size the first time and avoid returns."
2,Too wide and too heavy,"They are just too wide even I did not go with a bigger size as people recommended. In addition, they are too heave to just walk. The fit is so bad that they are easily slipped off from your feet when you walk. I will not recommend unless if you have wide feet and the weight do not bother you. I gave 2 stars since the build quality is pretty good. But if they don't fit, they can't be worn."
2,Sloggers 260KW08 Women's Premium Clog Size 8 Kiwi,"After reading some reviews on this product,suggesting that you buy a larger size since they run small, I went ahead and ordered the Size 8 Sloggers Women's premium clog. It turns out that the Size 8 (I'm normally a 6 1/2 - 7 size) is too big for me. The clog is also very loose or wide in the toes and my feet swims around the shoe when I wear it. Unless you have wide feet, I recommend not to order this product."
1,Not good for gardening,"The shoe is well-constructed, but slips off of the foot too easily. Even though it was sized right for my foot the back of it did not grip my heel sufficiently to stay on my foot. I returned them and decided my old Lady Bugs were the brand to buy."
5,Geisha Blue Shoes,"My best friend recently gave me a pair of the Geisha Blue Clog Sloggers in size 8. I told her I feel like the little Dutch Girl in my blue shoes. I absolutely love them and am wearing them as I write this. They are extremely comfortable. I also have Sloggers Boots, which are great for yard work and if I were to get another pair of boots I would choose 1/2 size larger for ease of getting on and off, and also another pair of Midsummer Shoes, which my son calls my Hippie Shoes because he thinks it looks like a marajuana plant on the front. They are all wonderful, water proof, and attractive. I have an ongoing pink ""Betty's Bag"" for little presents I find for my best friend and she has a ""Gwen's Goodies"" bag for me. We may go weeks or even months sometimes without seeing each other so that when we do we always look forward to not only seeing each other but to our treats. These Geisha Blue Sloggers are my best July treat."
2,My feet aren't that thrilled,"These clogs look neat and they seem to be of sturdy build. However, they are so loose that my foot has trouble staying inside it when I'm walking. And yes, I ordered the correct size. The length is almost a hair too small so there's no way I could wear a size smaller. They definitely do not fit like a glove and if I had to walk any distance further than my garden, I wouldn't and couldn't wear them. I am looking forward to being able to hose them down when I pick up mud, as I usually do when outside. That's their function for me."
5,AND THERE THE INDIAN STOOD. NAKED IN THE SUNLIGHT........,"THAT IS A PHRASE YOU WILL NEVER FORGET ... OUT OF 30 YEARS OF LIFE, AND 1000 BOOKS, NAN RYAN'S ""SUN GOD"" IS STILL MY ALL TIME FAVORITE. THANK YOU NAN, YOU SEXY WOMAN!"
3,Are you kidding me???,"The ending was rushed. The heroine got on my nerves, in fact I didn't like her till the end. I honestly did not like the ending. The book was a good book, and I give it 3 1/2 stars, but there could of been a better ending. It was almost like the author was rushed to end the book and put in some important details toward the last few pages."
3,Disappointed,The ending was very disappointing. Their daughter Linda played such a small role in the book. You would have thought the hero would have tried to meet his daughter or something. My favorite Nan Ryan book is still Scandalous Mrs. Howard.
3,Great for a romance novel,"This was a great steamy romance novel for it's time. It's LOADED with love scenes and has a decent plot. This probably is NOT a book you want your kids reading because of it's graphic love scenes. I enjoyed it and would read it again as an adult. When I was 16 I had bookmarked all the 'dirty' parts until my mom asked ""why do you have so many bookmarks in that book?"" If she only knew.....She thinks Nan Ryan is a trashy author who cashes in simply because of her erotic scenes. I can't really disagree with my mom but if you are looking for that kind of novel, Nan Ryan is the best of the best!"
2,Leaves alot to be desired,"As an avid reader of Nan Ryan I was truly disappointed in this book. I did not like all the revenge, the numerous characters and the depth she went into each character's history and the ending left me feeling as if I had wasted my time reading the book. The love scene portions of the book were typical Nan Ryan but the rest of the book...well let's just say it went to the Trade store the day I was finished with it."
5,UNBELIEVABLY ROMANTIC,"Once I started reading The Sun God, I just couldn't get myself to put the book down. Nan Ryan, I commend you on this wonderful novel. Characters and Setting - incredibly romantic. This was only my first Nan Ryan book that I've read, and now I'm in search for more. I only wish this book had a sequel. I'm passing on this romantic book to my friends, already mentioning that I want it back. I recommend that a reprint be made. It even made my heart melt and my eyes tear, in fact, I was actually crying. Again, this is a must read book!"
1,"Curious, so I bought it",Another trying hard wannabe dance diva. She should stick to singing ballads.
5,PS : Long live James Kirkwood!!,"I, too, have been a James Kirkwood fan for over 20 years, ever since I ran across ""PS, Your cat..."" in a local book store while killing some time. I laughed until I cried-for the main reason:(ala Vito) is that Kirkwood really brings out the humor of the most inane and rediculous variety! One page you are laughing, another your are crying. I don't believe they have done justice in the movies to his books(i.e. ""Some Kind of Hero""- NOT the way I pictured Eddie-I refused to see it). Please Amazon !! Have the publishers reissue Kirkwood so future generations do not miss out on his ""vividness""!!"
2,Dissapointing and offensive in many ways.,"After seeing this book around I got a copy after checking the reviews here :) But what I found is a 1973 old book that has finally been printed post-mortem, with some dippy 1973 sensibilities like you can fix any problem by smoking some strong marijuana, or it's OK to snatch a purse if the victim can afford it. Then there's the homo/bi-sexuality part, one of the major themes of the book. I wasn't offended but I didn't care for it either. This book should make a great movie for the Brokeback Mountain crowd."
1,PS Your Cat Is Dead,"The first half of the book was interesting. It then stalled in the middle, and the balance was torturous reading."
5,The best therapy book around!,"First I want to say I feel so sorry for reviews all over the internet who expect everything to be Steinbeck or Hemingway or Lynch or Kubrick. A book or movie can just be something to enjoy without it having to be a great work of art. And that's what this book is.I have read this book dozens of times and have lost numerous copies I have lent out and never gotten back. When I have a friend who is having a rough time with life and seems to be giving up hope, I lend them this book. It is a silly, quirky story of a life gone wrong and the absurdity that happens that brings things back to reality. The moral...no matter how crazy and out of hand life gets, it usually turns out OK. Life goes on and we learn from our experiences."
1,Chameleon movie,"The title of this move, according to IMDB, is ""Father and Son: Dangerous Relation"". It is also sold under the title ""Dangerous Relation"", which happens to be the title of an altogether different movie. I can understand how Amazon and its sellers are totally confused by the deceptive marketing practices of the distributor of this movie. Since they apparently are not willing to distribute this under its proper title, I am giving it only one star. Anyhow, if you order ""Dangerous Relations,"" as I did, this is apparently the only movie you can get."
1,Thomas Edison--the Fort Myers Connection,"What a disappointment! Not only is some of the history in this book misrepresented, it is just plain wrong. In spite of a very attractive layout and some interesting pictures, the book isn't worth the price. Scholarly research and more thoughtful presentation make Neil Baldwin's book EDISON: INVENTING THE CENTURY and Paul Israel's book EDISON: A LIFE OF INVENTION much better reading!"
1,Save your time and money and forget this book!,"I am a native fourth generation Floridian and so have a great affinity for all Florida history. I anxiously began this book expecting to gain new insights into Edison's life while living in Ft. Myers. If you share my interest, this book is NOT for you! The information seems overly generalized, poorly written and lacking of any true substance.If you want to learn about Florida history and/or Edison in particular don't waste any time on this book."
4,was good,"Needed to fill in my collection, very interesting, the history comes alive.makes good referance for discussions. I would buy it again."
5,"Pleasant memories, even if you weren't there!","I've subscribed to this magazine for over 20 years! Most of the stories are from the 30s, 40s or 50s when I wasn't even born, but it doesn't matter because reading about yesteryear, simpler times, when people took the time to sit and talk, help each other and appreciate family and friends is so rewarding. I look forward to each issue and have donated old issues to nursing homes, can't bear to toss them away when I know others would enjoy them. There was a Wanted Pages section which was very popular but it's been eliminated ending Nov/Dec issue because people complained of inmates and other unwanted people contacting them, sad. I plan on keeping my subscription as long as it keeps printing, I just renewed for 3 yrs!"
2,Good info - Bad production,The information on this DVD is good but the actual production of the DVD is rubbish.The sound quality is very average and his voice seems to be rushed and muffled in parts.Also is is very hard to pick out what he is playing without slowing the DVD down.He seems to rush over important bits.I have the book as well and the two compliment each other .
3,Not what I expected but I learned something,"I was hoping to find quick and easy ways of moving around the fretboard and KNOWING where I was at all times, but what I got was lessons on how to solo while watching some pretty uninteresting music being played to show the use of things like partial chords for soloing, F-A-D chords up and down the fretboard, etc. I found the info useful and helpful as it opening up mind to other options for playing but that not exactly what I bought the DVD for. If you are looking for a DVD with useful TIPS and TRICKS for soloing around areas of the fretboard, then this is the DVD for you."
2,Not what I expected,"This book was more of a personal travelogue than I expected. Too much"" We went here,saw that, we went there, saw that"", etc. Not enough narrative about the people they met and the places they stayed for my tastes. I would have liked to have heard about the trials and tribulations, frustrations, and problems encountered, along with the good stuff."
4,"Nice Overview, bit to broad","This is a good book for those that already have had a limited exposer to economics, but in no way goes over people's head. I feal Gene Callahan is true to his title with bringing economics to the masses. Its main theme of subjective value is well-explored, and changed how i view decisions that others make."
2,disappointing,"His analysis of the causes of inflation and business cycle, I feel are simplistic and naive. It is, however a somewhat adequate introduction to the Austrian school of economics. This book together with the Worldly Philosophers by Robert L. Heilbroner provide a good survey of economic thought, but alone this book is misleading and inadequate."
5,A Must Read!,"This book should be required reading at the high-school junior-senior level. This will teach you what money is, what your personal role in the economy can be, what the government's role should be and how to consider the current events happening in the world. Open your eyes to a whole new world!"
5,Just a wonderful book with fantastic translations.,I'm a fluent English and Spanish speaker. I think the translations are wonderful. The poems are beautiful in both languages. I continually buy this book because I usually give mine away and then feel I need to replace it.
5,A Classic,"I am so glad I bought this album. I have not gotten tired of it after playing it hundreds of times since the summer. I've bought it for a few friends and play it for people all the time because it's unique. I like Lucinda's other albums, but this one really made me a fan. There ain't a bad song in the bunch. It's about as close to perfect as it gets. Like someone else said in these reviews, her music doesn't always hit you on the first listen, but it gets under your skin. Then each time you come back, you notice something new about it, and whole worlds begin to unfold in the songs. Each detail is honest down to each and every word. Very powerful."
4,MUSIC CD,I BOUGHT THIS CD FOR ONE SONG BUT ALSO LIKE MOST OF THE SONGS ON IT. USED BUT IN GOOD SHAPE.
2,"Excuse me, but I just don't get it.","I'm baffled by all of the attention being paid to ""Car Wheels."" I've been listening to LW since ""Happy Woman Blues,"" am crazy about the self-titled album and ""Sweet Old World,"" and have been eagerly anticipating ""Car Wheels"" for lo these many years. I love the writings of Faulkner, O'Connor, and Percy, grew up in the South, and all of my relatives still live on red clay roads on southern Ga. farms. ""Car Wheels"" fulfulls New Yorkers' expectations of how Southerners are supposed to sound, and I think that's why Northern critics like it so much. To these ears, it just sounds like a parody, about as authentic as Steven Spielberg's depiction of the South in The Color Purple. There's a stultifying sameness to the melodies, and the lyrics sound like they sprung directly from subconsciousness to paper without any intervening critical faculties. A big disappointment from somebody who ought to know better."
2,Too deadpan for us,"We bought this CD after reading reviews at Amazon from professionals and customers. While we found the lyrics interesting and as full of sensory imagery as the title, Williams' voice is monotonous and her delivery has a deadpan quality that we found particularly grating. There is too much sameness of tone, pace and content."
4,A Great Album,"I really love this album, and it grows deeper on me each time I hear it. I haven't heard any other albums by Lucinda Williams, but I look forward to checking them out. I am happy that my friend lent me this CD, and I suggest it for others."
5,"I thought it would be good, but not THIS good.","Wow. This album is a powerhouse...without a weak track...and with an original sound. I was impressed with Williams' concert warmup for Dylan, but I never expected her album to rival Blood on the Tracks or Time Out of Mind....or damn near everything else ever recorded. Remarkable. They still make great music, Mom."
5,brilliant.... again,i am at a loss to descibe the brilliance of this album... lucinda never fails to amaze me and get inside my head. if this woman wrote her shopping list to music... i would buy the cd. she is THAT good!
5,You won't hear a better cd this year,"This is a stunning release from Lucinda, better than we might have expected after all the trouble she went through to get it right. It's the first worthy successor to Graham Parson's ""Grevious Angel."" Like a great novel or poem, the album's sense of ""place"" is inspired. This is an album about the South, and as its highly evocative title suggests, Lucinda's art will take you there. Every song and sound is loaded with sensory nuance. It's a stunning achievement becuase it is so subtle and ""simple."" You could play this album forever and not tire of it or hear all it has to say. At least, I'm planning to find out."
5,"""The Way You Move"" makes me swoon.","""Car Wheels on a Gravel Road"" is an example of musical genius. Lucinda Williams has created lyrics and music that is unbelievable. Someone I know went to one of her concerts and said it was the best he ever went to. I don't doubt it. I first heard Lucinda Williams about ten years ago, when I ""accidentally"" bought a tape, not knowing who she was. We listened to that tape until someone stole it. All I have left of that one is the cassette box and the memories of ""Passionate Kisses."" Let me tell you, no one sings that song better than her."
5,Totally addictive - I can't get it out of my incar cd player,"This album first caught my eye as a review in the London Sunday Times. Album of the year it suggested - and gosh, I agree. LW is clearly a woman who has suffered in love - the lyrics are poignant yet not schmaltzy. Her voice is worn and variable, tremulous at times but always expressive. The humdrum theme of Car Wheels contrasts well with Drunken Angel but the track of the album is I Lost it. Let's hope I don't!!"
2,Disappointing,For those of you who are purchasing Lucinda's work for the first time make sure you listen to a sample. The music/beat is very good but the lyrics are odd/goofy and she has a very rough sound.
2,I don't understand,I got this CD all sure that I would like it because of the great reviews and most of the people Lucinda Williams are compared to I love.I really was not impressed at all.
2,What a bunch of undeserving hype,"I'm consistently suprised at the groupthink mentality, whether it's popular music or alternative. Lucinda Williams was one of the best CDs I've heard and I've listened to it regularly over the last couple of years. The songwriting on this one doesn't compare. A lot of people want to like this CD and fewer actually do. The lyrics are overly repetitive and it doesn't have near the soul of her previous work."
4,"Though not as poignant as ""Sweet Old World,"" it's solid pop","It was a long wait, and there is a tendency to be so grateful when a new Lucinda Williams album comes out that anything you hear sounds perfect. In this case, such an assessment is nearly warranted. Starting with the radio-friendly ""The Way You Move"" and ""Car Wheels on a Gravel Road,"" the album offers track after track of solid, sensible songwriting delivered by Williams' sultry, slightly raspy twang. And in spite of the reported years and years of studio work the album required, the overall sound is anything but over-orchestrated. The only drawback of ""Car Wheels"" is the inevitable comparison to ""Sweet Old World,"" her previous effort. The album was filled with songs that could, in an instant, tear you apart. Though there are no such songs on ""Car Wheels,"" it is far better than most of what you will hear on the radio. Hopefully we'll hear lots of this one."
5,Best album of the year & 1998 isnt over,"with the assistance of Steve Earle, Lucinda has masterfully blended folk, rock and pop and came up with a hard hitting but introspective array of songs. I havent had this cd off the player since June..."
3,Disappointing,"I'm a big fan of Lucinda's, but I have to say I think this album has been overpraised. To be honest, I think her reputation continued to grow while she was working on this album -- in part because of the growth of the idiom, however undefinable it may be (No Depression magazine undoubtedly helped) -- and the critics were ready to lavish praise on almost anything she might put out.To be sure, there are some good songs here. And I do like the energy (and in concert, her band absolutely rocks). But the previous two CDs (Sweet Old World and Lucinda Williams) were better."
3,"DECENT, BUT DISAPPOINTING","Unfortunately, that six-year wait may have raised our expectations too high. Although this is a decent album, it comes off as over-produced and too studied for me. The inclusion of "" I Lost It"" (oneof the most over-produced songs on the CD) amuses me; with all that time, you'd have thought she wouldn't need to trot out previously recorded material. The one great track, ""Metal Firecracker"", almost makes it worth the price of admission, but if you're new to Lucinda (which I'm not; I have all her CD's) this isn't the one to start with."
3,Nowhere near as good as her first,"Please. Her first, 'Lucinda Williams', sounds like Springsteen on his best day. Loose, amazing guitar hooks, uncanny lyrics. There's simply nothing on 'Car Wheels' like 'Pasionate Kisses' I love Lucinda, but don't you miss the guitars, the organ, the feel? This sounds like a country album. 12-bar blues, accoustic, boring. Disappointing."
4,Keep the Wheels Turning,Car Wheels on a Gravel Road is a good folk-rock album. It's good simple sings with good lyrics that aren't covered up by a bunch of production. It probably won't work so well for the hyperactive or impatient. Just sit back and listen to and think aoubt the songs. You'll like 'em.
4,Surprisingly good,"I'd heard excerpts from this album from a non-commercial college station. It got my attention. This album is better than the excerpts. This album is honest, well produced and the musicianship is remarkable. In this era of over produced electronic sound it's good to hear something from the heartland where a guitar is a guitar and a voice is a voice."
4,Something a bit different,"As someone who grew up in Texas along side amazingly talented musicians, it's enjoyable to see an artist who doesn't pretend to fit everyone else's mold, and who has more to their voice than the sticky sweet Celine Dion drivel. This is music about people's lives, or someone's life anyway, and its as real as any music can ever be. Perhaps it is a bit of the south picked up and moved onto a spinning piece of plastic; just as idiosyncratic and imperfect as the South, but just as colorful and driven.For those overstuffed on the buffet of over-engineered ""pop"" music, recycling the same dull themes, it could be the breath of fresh air they need. This isn't country, it isn't rock, it isn't blues, it isn't jazz... it's just music."
4,Great Southern Storytelling!,"I first heard Lucinda on her duet with Steve Earle,""You're Still Standin' There"". I had also heard she was a great songwriter. After reading Rolling Stone's ringing endorsement, I took a chance on her, and I'm glad I did. I love singer-songwriters and Americana-style music that can't be labelled. I think that often it takes the songwriter to tell the real story and convey the true emotion of the song. When you combine storytelling with heartbreaking emotion and, even sensuality, then you've really got something. The album just flows and makes me want to hear more of Williams' earlier work. I believe her contribution to American music is vitally important."
5,So insanely good,"I was unaware that William's had reworked a couple older songs for this album. ""I Lost It"" benefits from the reinterpretation. Songs like ""Jackson"" and ""Greenville"" redefine longing and regret in genres far from William's country music home. How is this woman not better known?"
4,Good cuts from a gravel voice,Simplistic but haunting lyrics stick in your head. And that ain't a bad thing.
2,Hyped and Overated,"What, prey tell, is all the fuss about?I bought this album with great expectations, only to find it uninspiring and monotonous.Is there something I am not getting here, or is the success of this album just another example of hype at its most effective.I'll stick with ""Sweet Old World"" thank you very much."
1,I am not impressed.,"I am amazed at how such poorly crafted lyrics could make it in the big time. The singing is affected indeed. Whiney 90s style. Backed up with a good band, however, I could write a better song sitting in the bathroom with my son pounding on the door!"
3,Greatly overrated,"Comparing this CD to Lucinda's previous recordings is like comparing Clint Eastwood's 'Unforgiven' with his earlier 'The Outlaw Josey Wales.' This is Lucinda Williams music for the masses - easy, generic, country-pop. Her earlier stuff, like the 'Rough Trade' white lp, and 'Sweet Old World' put this to shame. Eastwood's 'Unforgiven' was the Western film for the masses(and it indeed won the Oscar), but the better film is 'Josey Wales.' Some real clunkers: 'Concrete and Barbed Wire,' 'Car Wheels on a Gravel Road,' and 'Joy.'Now go get her earlier CDs!"
3,"Over-rated, but I love the way she sings","A couple of good songs, but all in all a bit too squared off. Not much imagination, roots music doesn't have to be so dry. I was drawn to her by her appearance at the Gram Parson Tribute concert. When she has great songs to sing she is really fine."
4,I like it more with each listen,"If you expect really good singing, don't look for it here. These songs would have really been more improved if Lucinda had a better voice, which is occasionally quite annoying. However, all of the songs are very well played and arranged almost perfectly, which gives the cd the good name it deserves. I am not a fan of run-of-the-mill country music because the way those hicks sing is REALLY annoying, but this cd is pretty special. It's not just southern rock repackaged, just listen to the powerful opener that shows how similar she is to normal rock musicians. If I could really describe this cd, I would describe it as NOT lightweight in any way. Eventually you will get used to Lucinda's voice, after initial dissappointment. But you will never be dissappointed by the music and arrangements!"
3,the joy song.,I'm not a big fan of Lucinda Williams but the song Joy is so amazing. My sister and I heard it on XPN the this morning and we both immediately were like who is this?
5,Heartbreaking and beautiful,"I love this album! It snuck up on me. Now I listen to it all the time. And others I've recommended this disc to have done the same. The title track is filled with jarring images of childhood in the back seat of a car. The lyrics (""Got folks in Jackson we're going to meet"") can mean anything. I even love the fact that the chorus is repeated over and over, like taking I20 out of Mississippi. ""Lake Charles"" is a solemn requiem, while ""Drunken Angel"" is a raucous one. And anyone who describes an ex-boyfriend as ""Empty bottles and broken glass / Busted down doors and borrowed cash"" is to be treasured. I'd never want to be a subject of her songs, but I'll listen to them, always."
3,"The title song is good, but I like her older stuff better.","I listened to the title track repeated on my car CD for 2 hours straight, and it's a gem, but the rest of the CD isn't as consistently good as the Lucinda Williams CD (with Crescent City). Her edge though makes me buy everything she does though because no one else has her groove."
4,Hi!,"My dad introduced me to Lucinda Williams and told me to write a review for one of her cds. Well...She has very good lyrics.Not much of a beat/not much actual music.She sings with a lot of feeling.She sings good/not great.The funniest song is Joy (even though it's not sopossed to be funny). If that joy was so dang important ot her, she would at least remember where she lost it. The beauty of the song it that it's so mysterious, you can listen to it over and over again without getting bored by it.Another song, Drunken Angel, my favorite by her. It still seems more like an epic poem then an actual song.Sadly, I've only heard that much. From what I know she a very talented artist that more people should like (yes, Eminem, you might like her too)."
2,"Pave the driveway, please...","""Car wheels on a gravel road, car wheels on a gravel road, car wheels on a gravel road, car wheels on a gravel road."" I enjoy southern imagery but that is all we get here- imagery, not much substance. Good band, good production, unique vocal performance, but unremarkable songs."
1,very disappointed,"This has convinced me to get Real Player and never buy another CD without listening to it. With all those five-star reviews, I anticipated getting this wonderful CD. My first clue should have been the sticker on the front that referred to her ""rough-edged"" voice. I didn't find it pleasant--sort of a sleepy and monotonous--like a gravel road. How appropriate! If you prefer listening to someone who sounds like they enjoy music and life, don't buy this."
2,It would be boring if it wasn't so grating.,"I'm really baffled by the great reviews of this record. Williams' voice is horrible. It's not that her voice is unpolished; Dylan, Steve Earle, and many others pull off less than perfect voices by the strength of their delivery. Williams tries too hard to sound soulful, ending up sounding desperate, grating. The melodies are flat and uninteresting, and the lyrics are uninspired. Skip this and pick up a Steve Earle, or Blue Rodeo CD for some great ""American"" music."
3,The inevitable pull of the middle of the road,"An artist as loving, creative and emotional as Lucinda Williams deserves any and all the accolades currently raining down on her tousled head, particularly in a commercial music industry which has the reputation for crushing every genuine instinct you care to mention. CAR WHEELS ON A GRAVEL ROAD however, betrays (in my humble opinion) a slide towards the mainstream which doesn't do justice either to Lucinda Williams' muse or to the high expectations of her now devoted following. The production is slick, shallow and (bizarely) reminiscent of Bruce Springsteen's THE RIVER. The instrumentation has become merely conventional and her lovely, throaty, yearning singing is less interesting than on previous outings like her eponymous album and SWEET OLD WORLD.I'd like to like this album more than I do. Perhaps Lucinda Williams herself was uncomfortable with the results, which might explain why it took so long to achieve a release."
1,Very disappointing,"I have enjoyed Lucinda's work in the past, & looked forward to this one after all the rave reviews. Musically, there isn't much of interest. Her stories may be interesting, but this isn't a book. As music, it's kind of boring."
4,This is Real Life Grit (without Hollywood),"This one is a keeper for those who cherish real feelings and real singers who just do what they can't help doing: singing songs about their lives. There's no apparent marketing scheme going on here. Lucinda reveals heart-wrenching honesty in deceptively simple songs such as ""Lake Charles"" and ""Metal Firecracker."" And I wouldn't take a million dollars for Emmylou Harris's plaintive harmony on ""Greenville."" If you like overproduction and slick icon singers, avoid this one. But if you want to hear one woman's songs about livin', then get this one at once. It's no wonder Emmylou likes Lucinda's music."
5,Hot hot hot hothothothot...,"I am writing this in mid-July, in Albuquerque, in 90-something heat and sizzling sun, and there is no more perfect soundtrack for this time than this album is. Sweeter-sounding than her previous efforts, Lucinda Wiliams took 6+ years to get this CD ""perfected"". Was it worth it? All that, and more. Besides the songs, and her languid voice, and the pictures her lyrics paint, the arrangements are exactly what the material needs -- and gets. I know this is my album of the summer of '98. If you enjoy Americana-type music, do not hesitate to sink your consciousness into this soulful, sexy, simmering work of art."
4,"Interesting, very interesting",A different kind of music. Sorta a Bonnie Rait sound. Enjoyable but somewhat overrated by the description given.
2,Most overrated album of 1998,"Years in the making, enduring endless rerecordings and producer switches, this album arrived to no end of hype. Sad thing is, all the energy people devoted to it before it came out must have made everyone think they had to continue the hype even after finding out the album simply isn't very good. Williams' voice notwithstanding (too many criticisms of her focus on that), it's her writing that is poor. For a poet laurate's daughter, you'd think she'd be able to venture beyond cliche and half-baked ideas in her writing. Critic David Fricke called this the ""Blonde on Blonde"" of the '90s. Revoke his license."
4,A review of the following reviews,"Here, save some time. Most of the following people love this album. A solid minority hate it. Very few people in between. General consensus? If you don't mind vocals with character, if you don't mind songs with character, and you don't need Billboard to rationalize your musical tastes, you will probably enjoy this very solid collection of country/folk/blues musings.Otherwise, you'll long for your Dixie Chicks CD, and wonder why Sheryl Crow isn't even more popular. After all, SHE's got videos, right?"
5,"An excellent biography....,and biography",The reader is treated to a feast of biographical detail and insight. A rare and able biographer gives us a close-up and personal glimpse of a great man and character. What more can one ask for? In a league of its own!
5,A wonderfully crafted depiction of 'papa',"Hotchner really scores big with this book. The friendship between the two fueles the fire for this book of intense detail of the writer,lover, and friend within Hemingway. Their many adventures together bring vivid memories to Hotchner, and in turn he brings them to the reader. I feel that this biography, is by far the best literary biography done for the cause of Ernest Hemingway. This is a must read for the Hemingway fan."
5,Sheer Excellence! The Greatest Hits of Caterina Valente,"An excellent compilation of hits by Caterina Valente. This well mastered collection of Caterina's late fifty to early sixty recordings for Telefunken Records, showcases her remarkable talent. Caterina Valente offers a standard by which contemporary artists rarely equal in measure."
3,KatKong,"WHile the verbage of the story is poorly written, The photos are hysterical.My grandaughter doesn't read yet, so it's fine.I'll just re-write the story and paste it over the original one.I purchased it for the photos anyway."
2,Let's explore the plotline...,"Patterned after the storyline of ""King Kong"", of course, this tale involves a cat being kidnapped from his home, tied up in a burlap sack, and placed on display in irons in Mousopolis. After Kat Kong escapes he climbs up a tall building and is lured to fall to his death by a mouse in an airplane. Throughout the story the cat is made to look ferocious and evil, while the mice, who have engaged in kidnapping and who are responsible for the cat's death, are made to look cute and innocent.As the primary caregiver of 2 adopted cats, I find the story a bit disturbing, and children might find it disturbing too. The notion that children reading this story might be inspired to torment cats also disturbs me.I gave it 2 stars because despite my objections to the plotline, I still thought the artwork and prose were good.If you like this type of story and want to read it to a child, ""Dogzilla"" is the better choice since in his story, the dog is not kidnapped and murdered."
5,Purr-fect reading for all ages!,"This is an excellent book to share with children - especially those with a well-developed sense of humor. The jokes, illustrations, and play on words will appeal to all ages. As a teacher, I read this book to 2nd graders and then ask them to draw what Kat Kong saw in the package. The ideas start flying. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone!"
1,the most confusing book with no in depth explanation,this book is the most useless book and gives no in depth knowledge at all. this book has too many topics cramped in a limited space.all the details are missing and someone new to this field would find it extremely difficult to understand the topics mentioned in it.this book is more of a review guide than a study guide..so there are many other books available in market which are 10 times better written than this idiotic book... completely useless and waste of money.
5,Written by a master teacher,This is a very clear introduction to internetworking. Comer assumes nothing and opens the text with a thorough explanation of the fundamentals. He then patiently builds concept on concept. This is the best written technical textbook I have ever used.
3,Excellent Overview of one of the greats.,This book is is an excellent overview of the designs of John G. Alden and I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in his work. The only complaint I have about this book is it's low production quality. I have had several pages fall out of it's glued binding. I tend to be critical of a books prodcution quality because I want my books to last a lifetime. So take it for what it's worth.
3,Poor quality of pictures.,"I received this book and was disappointed with the quality of the pictures. An earlier hardcover edition I found at a local library had much clearer pictures; this 1995 re-issue as a paperback lost a lot of quality, and as a result, details of designs - crucial in an in-depth book such as this - are lost. The text is fine, but the pictures and details of the plans are what I look at most."
2,What Happened to The South of England?,"I received my 2004 guide to Great Britain today and excitedly leafed through the pages to start planning my trip-- I thoroughly enjoyed the pages about London (and booked my hotel based on Mr. Steves' advice) but then I continued planning the rest of my trip-- Has there been an earthquake in England and the whole southern part disappeared into the Channel? Where's Canterbury? Dover? Hastings? Chichester? Brighton--- I have wasted my money since 2/3 of my trip is planned for this area and there was NOTHING in the ads or in the title of the book that says ""does not include information on the southern counties""... The book is a ripoff."
3,An OK book,"I think Rick Steves is a good travel guide but in a way, he is a snob. He is quick to dismiss some places as too touristy or not worthwhile. I like the EyeWitness Guides much better."
3,Well-worn track through Britain,"Steves is full of practical travel advice, but he sticks to his own itinerary, hitting some of the most heavily traveled spots of Britain and seldom venturing off the beaten track. The complete absence of information on the beautiful and historic southwest of England including Winchester, Salisbury, and Cornwall is shocking."
4,Rick Steve's Great Britain 2005,"My husband and I have found this book very helpful, as we planned our trip to England. Mr Steve's narratives are interesting, and often in a younger person's vernacular. His simple maps are fun to look at, but could use some color to highlight intems such as public buildings, especially on maps with a lot of detail. The one drawback that we noted was that there are too few lodging recommendations, which are often booked way in advance (probably because of the author's recommendation), as we found out when trying to book them."
5,"A ""must-have"" for anyone taking a trip to Great Britian","Rick Steves is THE MAN. We had seen his shows on PBS, and new of him by reputation, but this was our first time buying one of his travel guides. We planned our entire trip, independently & without a travel agent, using soley Rick Steves' book. It's a wealth of knowledge, supplemented by little history lessons and his own editorial comments on the value of foreign cultures, which are best experienced intimately the way he advocates. It would be a great book to read just for fun, even if you weren't actually going on a trip there!"
1,useless for the budget traveler,"I considered taking Rick Steves on my trip to Scotland, but I was totally put off by his advice to forget searching online for airfares and just fork over $500 to a travel agent. Let's Go Britain and Ireland recommended several places to search for tickets online and found me a flight on Icelandair that cost $250. I flew into Glasgow -- a city that Rick Steves doesn't even cover!If you're happy paying extra to go exactly where Rick Steves wants you to go, maybe you should buy this book. If you want any part in the planning of your trip, Let's Go is a much better choice."
5,good mount,Had to replace the mounts because the trans was replaced a few times and the mounts were old and then stretched when the engine was pitched to get hte trans in and out. no problems at all. truck runs smoother than ever
5,If her poems are as moving as her letter to Laura...,"I have to admit I was not familiar with the work of Sharon Olds before today. Today I read her moving letter to Laura Bush explaining why she was declining her invitation to the National Book Festival in Washington.If her poetry is one tenth as moving, heart-felt, and true as that letter, she's gotta be one terrific poet, and I look forward to the volumes of her work I ordered from Amazon this evening. If you've not yet read her letter yet, I urge you, do so."
5,Powerful Writing,"Sharon Olds is an incredible poet, and should be read by anyone interested in current poetry. The poems in Strike Sparks are powerful language evoking clear visuals and strong feelings. The seeming simplicity of her writing style, coupled with her focused attention, leaves one wanting to turn each page and absorb yet another. At the same time, she has a wonderful sense of humor--the first page that flipped open when I first picked up the book was ""The Pope's Penis."" How can you not explore further after that?!"
4,"Great, but Kindle version has obvious spelling errors","This is a fantastic compilation of Olds' best works over the span of her career. Her poems are earthy, stunning and beautiful -- and this is coming from a reader who usually doesn't care for poetry. The only downside to this product is there are very obvious spelling mistakes in too many of the poems that do NOT correlate to the hard copy. It's easy to figure out what the right words should be, but come on now!"
4,Underappreciated Album and Singer,"Nothing much more to add to the many other reviews. This album is solid start to finish and is definitely worth adding to your collection. It is more of pop/rock feel than her later work, but not pop/rock in the annoying commercial sense, not at all in fact.Emm Gryner and Tara MacLean are probably the two most underrated female Canadian singers who often get lost in sea of the huge number of successful and talented Canadian women such as Sarah McLachlan, Alanis, Chantal Kreviazuk, Jann Arden and Nelly Furtado. Like many of the reviewers have said it is really unfortuante that more people don't know about Emm. Pick up this CD and give her a listen, her only better work might be AsianBlue, although Science Fair really grows with repeat listens."
5,i love emm gryner!,"""public"" is probably one of the best CDs i have in my collection. emm has a an independent and sexy voice without overly-sentimental lyrics. her music is refreshing and i would probably have to say that i like this cd better than her more produced ""asian blue"". ""public"" has an edge of raw honesty that ""asian blue"" lacks and it's even heard in the tone of her voice. i love all the songs on this album, but i especially love hello aquarius, wisdom bus, your sort of human being, july, 89 days of alcatraz and this mad. BUY THIS CD NOW!!"
5,Recommended,I really enjoyed this cd. If you like McLachlan then you should buy it. The songs are relaxing and voice is very good(not whiny).
4,"Better than a broken antenna, but I'm guessing there are better out there.","I needed to replace a broken retractable antenna on my car. This product was a fairly reasonable price, installation was fairly easy and it seems to work fairly well. If there is one area I think could be improved it's the ability of the antenna to pull in weaker stations. If you are outside an area with strong signals it has trouble receiving those weaker stations (and when it does receive them it doesn't sound great--as compared to a different antenna in my wife's van under similar conditions). However, all things considered, it does the job and I'd buy it again."
1,Choose something else,"This is not what I expected - it is see through so you must wear something else under it which adds to your size which is not helpful when your dealing with plus size! The arms are tight, the corset falls down exposing breasts since you cannot wear a normal bra, the feather in the hat is small and lies flat because of the packaging, and packaging states that it comes with a choker but my package had no choker. It ships from another company so it is not as easy to return as most Amazon items. Choose something else!!!!!!"
4,nearly died laughing,"True, this is not great literature and neither is the plot terribly good or believable, but, and this is a great but, I have never had such a good laugh since I can remember. In fact I was pleased not to be reading it on the bus as there is no doubt the bus driver would have driven straight to the nearest facility for mentally disabled people and dropped me off there. However, laughter is the best medicine. 4 stars for the best medicine I can remember and minus one star for its obvious imperfections."
3,"It does some things well, but.......","This grill does chicken breast and fish filets wonderfully, but it's not so great on beef and pork; the outside gets too done before the inside is completely cooked.I also don't like the nonremovable grids--makes it a hassle to clean up.Returned unit and bought another with a thermostat and removable grids."
3,A good product but..........,"I have had the George Foreman for a while... while it is a convenient tool, it is good only for chicken and fish. The heater plates don't get hot enough to make a good steak that is seared on the outside but rare on the inside. It causes almost uniform cooking through the thickness of the meat. For the same reason it has a tendency to dry out chicken and fish.. but that being said, if you baste sufficiently, reasonably moist chicken and fish can be cooked.If you are serious about cooking/grilling indoors invest in a cast iron skillet..."
2,Hard to clean.... The food smells stay in appliance,"I like the way the grill cooks the food and I like how the food tastes, but....... if you cook fish (or any food for that matter) the smell stays in it until you cook something else. It's a hassle to clean. It should have removable grills. These are the reasons it only got two stars from me. Also........ if I was going to buy this again, I would buy the bigger one. It's very good for one person though. Buy it with the idea that you are going to need at least 10 to 15 minutes to clean it the correct way!"
3,Meat cooks uneven,"The meat cooks very uneven on this grill. You constantly have to flip the meat over to get an even cook. Other than that, the grill would have been nice."
2,On the blink after only 5 months,"Don't get me wrong, I love my George Foreman grill. We got it for a Christmas present last year and we didn't take it out of the package until April/07. We grilled at least 2 or 3 times a week and enjoyed the convenience of it. Within the past month it has been going on the blink. It won't turn on or heat at times, but if we plug it in the next day it usually works. Today halfway through the grilling it just died. I'm very disappointed. I can see by the other reviews that maybe I got a lemon.We most likely will buy the bigger grill next time and I hope our luck changes on the life of the unit."
2,Only good for grilled cheese,I don't use it anymore. It takes all the juice out of the meat you're cooking so everything you cook ends up dry or burned. I hate cleaning it...if you're gonna get one of these get ones where the trays come off & you can put them in the dishwasher..trust me...it's VERY hard to clean if you leave it dirty for more than an hour. I would have given it 1 star but it does cook shrimp pretty well. It's a shrimp-cooker but makes really dry chicken & hamburgers..yuck.
4,Great for the Price,"I got this little grill for $15. I use it once a week cooking for 2. It hasn't seen heavy use but some of the teflon has already rubbed off the groves. No big deal, seeing how much we paid for it. I like the fact that it doesn't take up much room, and the drip pan thing keeps the excess grease out of the food. Downside is that it take a few minutes to clean. I have to take the entire unit to the kitchen sink. But if you coat the food and the grill with lots of olive oil, it helps to prevent burning and makes it easier to clean. Overall, it works for the functionality versus frugality. Dont expect food to taste like it came off a real grill."
5,LOVE IT!!!,"A MUST HAVE for everyone! I forgot that I HAD IT , and we've been using it so much! Even Frozen items ( hotdogs) work...mm...:) GREAT!!"
3,good book,This was a very good book and I enjoyed reading it. This book makes you fell like you where really on one of the battle ships of WW2. It is about england trying to stop the greatest ship of its time the bismarck.
2,"Pretty, but not as expected.","The lamp is bright enough to use as a night light. It was pretty, but not as expected."
2,Everfine Palm Tree T Shirt,"Item was a little flimsy....and sizing was not correct....We ordered an extra large, just in case of shrinkage, but the t-shirt seemed already shrunk, possibly to a size Medium.Not really pleased with item."
4,Soul,For Awhile is a typical Nina classic. She has been around for awhile and can still sing with the best of them. A must have for Nina lovers.
1,THIS BOOK SUCKS!!!,"I studied this book front and back for three months and failed my Esthetician written exam. Seriously, I thought Milady's was supposed to be the best. But apparently that's just for sales.Lucky enough I found a study guide that ACTUALLY had the questions and answers to to Esthetician exam. I studied this book for TWO DAYS and guess what?? I received a 90 on my written exam. If you want a book that actually is going to have up to date material go to lulu.com and search Wendelyn Muckerheide. Thats the author and the only way it will come up. The book is called ""State Board Exam Review for the Esthetician Student"". Trust me if you study this book you will PASS like I did!!! :)"
3,Do your repairs correctly,"This is the cheapest product that you can find, with that said u should at least install the proper way to make something that is cheap look decent.some liquid nails and a little elbow grease will make your wall board stay on"
4,Totally saw this coming,"Archer Prewitt was poised to put out an album of this consistent quality. While he and his accomplished band have been brilliant at times, they always seemed to leave me feeling there was something missing.This record finally fills in all the blanks and is a genuinely brilliant piece. It really captures everything that I've felt that Archer Prewitt has been capable of.simple complex dark light silk sandpaper war peace beginning end fresh rotten you've been spikedI assure anyone who reads this that Archer Prewitt - Wilderness is an emotion"
5,Can I get some more stars over here?,This is quite possibly the most beautiful album I have ever heard. The only thing to come this close to perfection in recent memory is Circulatory System's debut. The only people that dislike either album also dislike puppies and sunshine and enjoy clubbing baby seals.
1,Alternate opinion,"Given the glowing reviews here, on Pitchfork, and elsewhere, I expected something completely different. This album is horribly dull. His previous album, ""Three,"" is much more creative and interesting."
4,Comprehension Help,"I used this series while home schooling my kids. This book is listed on the publisher's site as intended for grades 4-5,but with any one struggling with comprehension it is certainly appropriate up through grades 8-9. The subject matter would be appealing through that age also."
5,An excellent book that changed my whole life!!!,"My life has been devided into two parts: before and after reading the 'Shibumi'. It gave me the concept of 'overwhelming calmness' to which the development of any person must be directed. However, the 'overwhelming calmness' is not the the aim in itself, but one of the most important stages on the way of the endless development-the only worthy thing in the world."
5,All wrapped up,"This is a very soft, warm blanket. The color is actually a light mint green, a very calming color. My son loves the blanket. I put it in his closet to save for winter, but he got it out to use now. It's a nice blanket for any season at an excellent price."
3,"run of the mill, yet still warm","good idea for a throw blanket during those chilly winter nights while watching tv, or using the computer"
5,Great for pastors,"I've been in children's ministry for a few years, doing my best to help kids and families in times of loss. This book has given me so many important insights into a child's loss of a parent and any other type of loss that a child may face. The end of each chapter is especially helpful for those of us in children's ministry. Children's pastors, youth pastors and senior pastors, you need this book!"
4,One Of The Most Beautiful Albums Ever,"I love this album, it is so romantic in the best sense of the word! It is absolutely beautiful! The tunes are mostly ballads but it has a Latin pulse to it and is very good listening from a jazz as well as a non jazz perspective. Haden plays beautifully as usual. Would give 4 and a half stars if I could....I only give a select few albums a 5 star."
5,Gorgeous,"This is one of the most beautiful recordings I have ever heard. I have been playing it continuously for 3 weeks, but the music is so fresh I never get tired of hearing it. The songs are all ballads, but each song is so unique that the listening remains inspirational throughout. Gonzalo Rubalcaba displays his usual deft touch on the piano, and Pat Metheney's guitar work on Noche de Ronda is wonderful. The violinist is excellent, and Joe Lovano's saxophone work is superb. The unusual combination of piano trio, sax, and violin is different and fresh, and it really works. I can't recommend this recording highly enough; every cut on the CD is excellent. I would give it 6 stars if they let me! ""Nocturne"" is a beautiful recording that will stand the test of time, and will find its way into your player over and over again."
2,Don't buy it!,"Now this is a real disappointment, and I even bought it a full price. I saw it on the list of Down Beat's Album of the Year and bought it without thinking twice about it. A far cry from ""Always Say Goodbye"", which is in a similar laid-back style. And an even farer cry from his duo record with Kenny Barron, ""Night and the City""."
5,Dreaded Assignment becomes Starvation for More,"I was given this book to read as an assignment in my Sociology class at college. I dreaded reading the book and put the assignment off as long as I could. However,once I started reading I could not put it down. Huie does a great job, through his interviews and quest for the truth, at putting you as close to the people and events of this historical time as one possibly could. It displays the most extreme and openly admitted amount of prejudice toward the African Americans held by the citizens of the state of Mississippi during the 1960's."
3,Material,"The print and the size is good but the material is poor. Thin, not soft and made of water resistant synthetics. Ideal for just sitting on or lie."
5,Looks good!,"Looks good, I bought it as a gift for a friend who just had a baby. Seems to be durable, though I did not personally try it out. Recommended."
1,Waste of money,"This thermometer is a complete waste of money. Used less than 5 times and the battery was dead. Cover wouldn't open easily and after finally managing to replace the battery, it wouldn't switch on anymore. Don't buy this."
1,Battery Blues,The battery was not only dead upon arrival but very hard to remove in order to replace it. Poor choice of thermometer....never again
1,Came with dead battery,"It didn't get off to a great start with a dead battery.We have an older Vicks V965 Basal thermometer. Basal thermometers are the more accurate version needed for tracking ovulation.So we wanted a spare as a backup or for travel. Fortunately, Amazon had it.Or not. Apparently this is the V965R. This version is not a Basal thermometer. The rapid reading feature advertised might have been a hint, but who would have thought it with the same model number?This thermometer measures by waiting until the temperature reading starts to level off. It's not clear how level is enough for it, but the times vary from 8-25 seconds and the readings vary by about half a degree, which is very significant when an 0.4 degree temperature shift is normally interpreted to signal ovulation. So our confusion aside, the thermometer is very inconsistent."
1,rip off,"Total rip off. Why on earth would a company put such a lame device on the market? especially when a parent is desperate for an affordable thermometer, only to be ripped off."
1,Doesn't Work Straight from the Box.,"Right out of the box, this item would not work and it is an item that is not allowed for return. Thankfully, customer service was able to help with this by giving me a refund. I will NOT be buying this item again. I will find something else to replace it with."
1,didn't work,it did not work. Possibly the battery was dead. I had to send elsewhere for a replacement and as yet have not received it.
2,Not so happy :-(,"We were in the midst of moving when I ordered this and when I got it, it didn't work. Tried to replace the battery and that didn't help. I may have just gotten a dud so don't let it discourage you from trying it if there are more good comments than bad."
4,does the job,"seems mostly accurate - times to a temp are longer than advertised, but temps are consistent. probably not hospital quality, but definitely isn't hospital price. no regrets with purchase."
2,battery cover hard to unlock,"The product comes with battery exhausted, and it is really hard to unlock the battery cover, so I have not got chance to use the product so far."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!! NOT RELIABLE!,"From the first use out of the package this item has been ridiculouslu inconsistent and inaccurate. Will give me readings of 95.1 and then minutes later will read 97.4, 97.9 and then 98.8. This is a coomplete waste of money and actually quite dangerous if you need to know if someone is running a fever. Scary."
1,Consistently inaccurate,"I like the idea of a quick, inexpensive near-instant thermometer. But after using this several times, both healthy and sick, it has never registered above 98 degrees. Repeated readings in a short time resulted in significant variations. Now, sick and feverish, I find I am at 97.8, while the old mercury thermometer has me at 101.Not the diagnostic tool I had would depend on."
2,battery don't last more than 10 uses,"When we 1st purchased this thermometer the battery was dead even before we used. The second time round, the battery lasted no more than 10 uses and it was out again. The 3rd time lasted about 12 uses. It's now dead again.According to specification under the instructions, the battery life isstipulated at more than 300 measurements or approximately 2 years ofusage. we are very disappointed with the product due to this reason. Other than that, I loved the big read out and colored back light."
1,More Junk from Vicks!,Another Vicks thermometer. And still more junk! It dies very fast. And changing batteries doesn't work. Please don't buy a Vicks thermometer.
1,do not buy!,I bought this thermometer and used it s few times when the battery died. I went out and bought a new battery and the darned thing won't work at all now. 3 or 4 uses for $15.00 ??? What a waste of money! I bought an off brand from a local drug store for $3.95 that seems to do the same thing and still works after countless uses.
3,Eh.,"It's okay, but I expected more of Shakespeare's original language and style to be incorporated into the reader's texts. I know it's intended for younger kids and I like that there's some summary and that the plays make the story very clear. It's also nice that they're so concise and that so many texts are included. However, there's absolutely no sense of Shakespeare's style in the plays. Even famous lines that kids might have heard referenced before have mostly been translated into more modern language. Not bad, but could have been better."
2,Disapointing,The movie was much less than I expected. I found themovie to be more boring than something that would catchand hold a viewer's interest.
5,The Strange one,"an excellent movie, long out of circulation. This restored version - from the previously cut release- makes more sense of the story and is in more in depth and satisfying."
3,Great to have a reference between tarot and crystals,This is the first tarot deck I have seen that correlates crystals to each of the major arcana and minor arcana. They used some very nice specimens in their photographs. The card stock seems a bit lighter than other decks and the cards don't hold up well after multiple shuffles. Seems better to mix them by hand. Some of the photos are really beautiful and others are on the drab side or the photos are not true to color.We used these in a class and half of us had an allergic reaction to them - something in the varnish or ink I suspect. Might want to open them outside and air them out a bit first as they also smell a little funny.This is the first deck I have seen where trump card #8 is Justice instead of Strength and card #11 is Strength instead of Justice.The interpretations in the pamphlet are insightful so I think this deck is still worth getting.
2,Boring,"These aren't even particular stunning pictures of gemstones; they look like you could find them in any book for rock enthusiasts. It's difficult to connect meaning to each stone, unless presumably you're very much a crystal person when it comes to divinatory meanings.In other words, to me, I might as well have cardstock with the card names on them, and then spend some time looking through a Field Guide to Rocks and Minerals for all I got out of this deck.Card stock is mediocre."
5,Winged Victory: Altered Images: Transcending Breast Cancer,"This is a fabulous photo book celebrating women's bodies after mastectomy. The pictures are very well done with great artistic effects.I would recommend this for anyone going through this procedure and any medical facility providing mammograms, mastectomy and breast cancer treatment."
2,I've walked the walk,"I have ""walked this walk"" twice. This book would not have been helpful to me at all. I understand his intentions and apparent empathy; however, this is a VERY personal decision. Most of us are focused upon living and not appearances."
1,Do Not Buy This Book!,"If you're even considering this book, do yourself a favor, as I did, and go to the library and preview the book. One wonders how a book like this gets published. The only thing that Wildi, the author, masters is how to indulge his ego. He spends much of the book telling you what you should and shouldn't do. He teaches nothing about how to incorporate your own personality. Basically, he would like you to memorize his techniques. He misses the point that, firstly, photography is art. I agree wiht a previous reviewer that, at times when you read this book, it almost seems that he was forced to write it. ""Photographic Composition"" by Tom Grill and Mark Scanlon is a much better book. Probably any other book on this subject would be superior alternative."
4,"was shipped just in time for Mother's Day, and Mom loved it!","This perfume is a favorite of both my mom and mine. It's not easy to find. You won't find it in retail stores, and many on line want more than I found it from this seller. What a beautiful scent and bottle and it's a wonderful addition to your perfume collection. People always ask ""what are you wearing?"" That can either be good or bad; but in this case, they always want to know so they can buy it too!"
5,You can never go wrong with the classics,"I get the most compliments with this one perfume, more so than with any other one I wear. It is floral scent, without being overbearing."
5,A Witness Who Still Testifies,"Zahn's meticulous investigation of the thoughts and conscience of an Austrian farmer over 60 years ago caused me to do some heavy thinking. I realized the basic ethical questions dealt with still apply today. The convictions of this simple man Jaegerstaetter have unexplainedly and very deeply stirred my heart. Whether you agree with him or not, you can't help but admire him for standing by what he believed in the face of the Nazi regime."
5,Update: Franz Beatified,"I had written a review previously (see above). On June 4, 2007, the Vatican announced that the subject of this excellent book, Franz Jaegerstaetter, will be beatified -- i.e., declared ""Blessed"" -- and the normal requirement of one miracle attributed to him will be waived, because he died as a ""martyr of the faith"". This is the penultimate step before being canonized, or declared to be a saint in the Roman Catholic Church. It was Zahn's book that brought the public's attention to Franz's ""solitary witness."""
5,The price of character,"It is a shame this book is out of print and I felt very blessed to find a copy. The book describes a man of great personal integrity - a rare thing in today's culture. It is also very telling that some elite minds found it incredulous that an uneducated peasant could not only recognize evil, but also refuse to accommodate it. Very well documented."
5,The book is bery easy to read and the recipes are excellent,"I am Belgian. This book was given to me by an American friend while I was residing abroad. It is well written and very easy to understand, even if you are not a chef! It includes a lot of recipes that were used by my mother in her daily family cooking.I enjoy it and am using it all the time"
5,The best Cookbook I've Ever Used,"My father always said that Belgian cooking is the best in the world. After a trip to Brussels, in which I was absolutely overwhelmed by the wonderful flavors of every meal I ate, I would have to agree with him. Belgian cuisine has its basis in medieval cooking, and favors such combinations as fruit with meat, and beer used to cook virtually anything. This cookbook is full of surprising and delicious food combinations, and these hearty recipes are wonderfully easy to make! Flemish Style Braised Endive is now one of my favorite things on earth to eat. Another big favorite in our household is Chicken with Grapes. The flavor combinations are fabulous."
5,Every Recipe Works,"I have tried almost every recipie in this book and they are all excellent. Not one failure ! Very practical, easy and with history. I don't think anyone would regret buying this, I use it all the time."
3,Picture deceiving,"Product does not look exactly like picture, part of the folder is clear. Product is nice, but would have prefered solid color pictured."
5,Dead Is Better!,"This movie is a great example of a horror movie. It has not too much blood and just enough killing. Very disturbing when the child dies, but picks up after his reincarnation. An unsuspected ending, never saw it coming. I recommend this to all horror movie and Stephen King fans. It won't be a disappointment."
5,The king of the so-bad-it's-funny movies,"Pet Sematary is, hands down, the worst ""horror"" movie I've ever seen, but it thankfully falls into the category of movies that are so dreadful that they're hysterical to watch, which is why I enjoyed it so thoroughly. The collection of actors is awful -- there's not a good performance in the bunch. The family patriarch would be better off playing a serial killer, while the daughter is the most annoying screen child to grace my television in a long time. But the film's most ghoulishly-delivered line -- ""The ground beyond is...SOUR!"" -- sends me into giggling fits every time I hear it, and it's well worth watching just to see the unbelievably bad make-up job done on a flashback character with spinal meningitis. Go into your viewing with an open mind and low, low expectations and your experience should be a blast -- and keep an eye out for Stephen King's brief cameo as a minister at a funeral."
1,Horrible adaptation of a terrifying story...,"This absolutely COULD have been a frightening movie. The movie (for the most part) stuck to the book, BUT why did they pick the absolutely most bland actors to play the characters? With the exception of Fred Gwynn, the acting was atrocious in this movie. The actor who played Louis Creed delivered all of his lines in a monotone voice, and we were not able to see the extent of his anguish over the death of his son.This is one of my favorite King novels, and one of my LEAST favorite King movies."
2,THERE ARE SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW SO BEWARE!,"This is absolutely one of the stupidest movies I have ever seen in my life. I admit that it did have some scary scenes but the plot was just stupid and the end of it was morbid. First Louis buries his son in the graveyard so that he will come back to life, then he kills his son. Then he buries his wife and she comes back to life and kills him. That's just really morbid in my opinion. It wasn't ALL bad though. Like I said, it did have some really scary scenes. And I thought that Dale Midkiff and Denise Crosby were pretty good together. You might enjoy it if you like stories with really morbid endings. But this is definitely not my type of movie."
1,Read The Book,"""Pet Sematary"" is one of King's finest books. A truly terryifying reading experience which is ruined by this lame movie."
1,pet sematary,"Got the movie,but not the cover I saw on the website,I keep looking for this specific cover,but I can't find it.So watch what you buy,the covers might be different from the website."
4,Nasty Kitty,"An above average adaptation of Stephen King's scarey novel The Pet Sematory. Admittedly, I liked the book much better but this movie does have it's moments of horror. The acting is good including the cat from hell as well as the young lad brought back from the grave..........."
3,Fair Zombie flick King style,"Let's face it whenever Stephen King is involved in any of his movies they generally suck. He scares the hell outta me on page but not so much on the big screen. And his made for T.V. movies are horrible. Three stephen King movies stand heads above all. 'Salem's Lot', 'Carrie', and 'The Shining'. But.... I really like zombies and while not a true adaptation of the book (thank the King himself for that) it's not bad. If you're into zombies check this out for something a little diffrent. FYI the book is awesome."
3,"suspenseful, but confusing","This movie would be very confusing for someone who never read the book. The movie is choppy an doesn't quite explain everything about the story. The acting was not very convincing. On the good side, the movie was suspenceful and scary. All and all, you should read the book first and watch the movie for laughs afterward."
2,Ok I guess,The book was great but I have never seen such BAD acting in any other movie. Read the book and skip the movie!
3,Doesn't do the book justice!,"This was an amazing tale by master story-teller Stephen King but the video does not do the book justice. I preferred reading the book and using my imagination to fill in the faces and places. The movie wavered so far from the book in my mind that I only remember the story as I read it, not saw it."
2,Big Failure at the End,"Read whatever everyone else said, but...King's book ended abruptly in a way that was shocking and ambiguous: the reader could decide that the ending was either hopeful or horrible. The movie chooses for us (and incorrectly in my view) with an ending that screams WE'LL TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENED BECAUSE IF WE LEAVE YOU HANGING THE FOCUS GROUPS WILL REJECT OUR ENDING and destroys the movie."
1,So awful it's funny,"I agree with all the thumbs down reviews, and am totally puzzled by anything rated higher. This is the worst film adaptation from a thrilling novel, ever. The characters are totally wooden, poorly selected, no chemistry, & what the hell is Yar doing in this movie? What the hell is she doing in any film?I especially enjoyed that the family, knowing how dangerous the road was, sits close to the road & lets the toddler run right into the road: smack. The acting is horrid, the whole movie is poorly cast. I did like that the father-in-law belted the irresponsible Dad at the funeral. He should've taken out his own daughter while he was at it. Idiot parents.....but then, this is one idiotic movie.I heard the sequel is even worse. That's all I need to hear. Hopefully you all too."
1,Sick,"This is a terrible movie, its one of the dumbest things I have seen...whats up with the way the moms sister looks? talk about stupid, thats just [bad]! The boy played by Miko is so cute though. But this movie, its bad."
2,Not What I Thought It Would Be,"I talked to some guy that worked at Block Buster and he said this movie was really creepy and scary. I never thought older movies were scary but the guy said they were. Ends up, I win! The movie had no point. The people in it were really stupid. I'm not sure if they were supposed to be like that or not. It was un-realisted also. I have no idea what kind of creep would come up like a movie like this. Don't really bother seeing this movie... unless you are REALLY obsessed with Stephen King..."
3,Classic King,"This is a veary well done movie worth seeing in my opinion but its kind of cheesy in places and the ending sucks the reason I gave it 3 stars is the fact that all the charecter's die at the end and the acting is pritty bad but all in all a good film but its a better book other Stephen King movies that are better are Christine,Maximum Overdrive,Carrie and Dream Catcher anyway all in all a real good horror film"
5,"GOD, I WAS SCARED!!!",This movie sent shivers down my spine! I bet anyone can't watch it alone in the night!!!
3,You have to read the book,"Pet Sematary really can't stand alone. With the exception of the wonderful Fred Gwynn as neighbor Jud every actor is miscast. Too much plot is cut out of the movie and it suffers because of it. In the book you understand why poor obsessed Louis Creed does the things he does. In the movie you won't. When Louis buries baby Gage in the Indian burial ground it makes no sense. Judging from the unpleasantness with the cat, you'd think he'd no better but he doesn't. After Gage kills his mother Louis then buries Rachel and is killed by her. The movie just lacks too much heart to make me care about it."
2,Tries hard but never becomes scary,"This adaption of the terrifying and exquisite book by Stephen King never rises above mediocre. The emphasis is on gore and guts instead of the novel's intelligent approach to the real horror of the death of a child. Though Fred Gwynne is perfectly cast, he doesn't have too much to work with. I think you might enjoy the film though had you never read the book to compare it to, because it does have a dash of suspense and horror."
4,A Pretty good horror movie,"I thought that this movie was very, very freaky. It is really not a movie for someone who is disgusted by gore. It is also depressing at parts because a little 2-year old boy gets hit by a truck then is raised from the dead and goes on a killing spree. Over all it is pretty good."
5,Great!,It does not too much gore. Its mostly suspence and action at the same time. You must see this movie.
5,"Creepy,,just fantastically creepy!","I definitely agree with one sentiment,,I read the book, (this one and Salem's Lot, scared the B'Jesus out'a me!) you want to read ""Pet Sematary"" in the daylight! Same with watching this movie! I'm like ""do not go up to the Mic Mac Burial Ground"" well crafted creepy horror fare!"
5,SEEN IT A HUNDRED TIMES 1,IT'S A VERY COOL MOVIE I NEVER GET GET PART TWO IF YOU CAN IT'S ALSO COOL ADD IT TO YOUR COLLECTION EVEN IF YOU;VE SEEN IT TIRED OF WATCHING IT I USUALLY WATCH IT LATE AT NIGHT ADD IT TO YOUR COLLECTION EVEN IF YOU'VE SEN IT SEVERAL TIMES BEFORE JUST LIKE I HAVE NEVER FAILS TO ENTERTAIN !
3,"Gory, messed-up, goofy fun","There are some things you just can't help laughing at here, like some of the acting, especially from the little girl and the guy playing her father. Also, the little zombie boy is obviously a dwarf or a puppet in some scenes.Still, it's messed-up fun: Imagine a graveyard that allows pets or people that are buried in it to come back to life. Except....they don't come back right. They are murderous and have to be killed all over again.There is a real multiple tragedy in the film as well, and you can't help but be sad about what happens by the end.It makes a good cautionary tale, however."
1,"Great Book,Horrible Movie","Sorry guys,but I really,really detest this movie.As I was reading the book,which is one of my favorites I was always thinking how if they made a movie out of it,it would probably be awful because they would do specific scenes one way instead of the correct way.Well,guess what? That's exactly what happened.Save yourself some money and just buy the book instead."
2,REALLY DUMB,"This movie, at least i found, was dumb. It was a little gross, weird, and the story was really stupid. How can this get 4 stars? who are these actors anyway? if you want a real stephen king movie, watch misery."
4,As good as the book.,"This is a good horror film that does justice to the book. King does a good job as the screenwritter and watch out for his cameo. Not the best horror film, but is still a good film. Get it on this special edition."
4,surprisingly good,"Yes there are aot of stephen king movies that have stunk. and there are the excellant ones, Carrie, Stand by Me, Shawshank redemption, The green Mile. and then there are ones like pet semetary which are alot better then you would expect.A young couple with two young children move into a new house and are shwon the pet semetary. the husband finds out this cemetary has a hidden past and a deadly secret. I won't go into detail about the movie as many others have to say except this is pretty good. The acting, direction and the creepy music by elliot goldenthal. Dale Midkiff, denise crosby and fred gwynne all did a good job. Some of the creepiest scenes have to be with Zelda. Those scenes give me the creeps to this day.Avoid the sorry sequel which should have never been made!"
2,Coulda been better,"I've always gone back and forth on this movie. As I am sure it's a fantastic book and story, the bad acting doesn't live up to those same expectations. Suprisingly bad performance by Jessica Lange. The only real suprises are a great performance by Fred Gwynne and the little boy, who turned out to be a star in his later years. I do admire Mary Lambert, but maybe she's better off sticking with music videos rather than movies.My answer is a remake of the original with a different cast."
2,Book waaaaaaaaaaaay better,"I read the book and it scared the bejesus out of me, so I thought lemme watch the movie. After all, the Shining was a really scary book AND. A spectaularly done movie.Not this case. The movie was true to the book story, but the acting was so bad. The lil boy looked adorable not creepy, and we know little kids can look convincing (Danny in the Shining).In a way, though, I'm relieved. The book was soooo scary I was nervous to watch the movie. But no. It wasn't as good as the book."
3,"""Where The Dead Speak""","Gruesome,over the top and featuring a very disturbing premise PET SEMATARY is one of Stephen King's most famous book to movie adaptations. In fact the movie depicts so many nightmarish scenes that I soon became numb to the horror and carnage being presented. There are a few sequences that seem to be present merely for shock value and some plot elements are so full of holes they seem nonsensical. The acting is quite mediocre with the exception of the remarkable work by character actor, Fred Gwynne, who is most famous for playing Herman in the 60's sit-com THE MUNSTERS. Gwynne gives a terrific portrayal of Jud, the well intentioned, Maine resident who knows and tells more than he should unwittingly releasing some truly horrible events. And the character Zelda has given more than her share of bad dreams to viewers of the film. Despite the presence of the cute child actors this film is definitely not for the kiddies."
4,One Of The Best Stephen King Adaptations....,"People really need to get over the fact that movies adapted from Stephen King novels aren't exactly like the novels! Get over it! With that being said, this film is probably one of my favorites. The acting in it is awesome. I don't think anybody really gives Fred Gwynne the credit he deserved as dramatic actor. Everyone remembers him from the Munsters but he had the ability to portray sadness in such a moving way. Take note of his acting after the funeral scene. I truly love this movie. Other good movies that were based on Stephen King's novels are: ""Carrie"", ""The Shinning"", ""It"", ""Salem's Lot"", & ""Silver Bullet"". I love these movies and there's an added bonus because of the King relation. I guess I wouldn't recommend any of these movies to those Hard-Core King fans. Just remember that it would have taken about 9 hours to make ""It"" exactly like the novel!!! If you've never read the book, check out this movie. It's so great!"
1,A Disappointment to Readers of the Book,"At the annoucement of a new King book I race to be put on a waiting list or buy it outright. What involves me in his books is the partnership that he establishes with his readers. His words feed the readers imagination and therefore involve him/her in the story. This movie forgot about the partnership and attempted to represent what should have been left to the imagination. The little boy was comical and the actors should have been allowed to act. I will continue to watch and read everything that King throws our way, but this work does not represent what I know he is capable of doing."
1,Bad Movie!,"This movie was not very good! the book was so much better, don't waste your time or money on this crap! The movie was not very good adaptation of the book! if you must see it, rent it, don't buy it!"
2,pet sematary okay movie,The evil has arise this movie is okay but i love part 2 it's the best movie way better then this but would i recommended it too anyone No
3,One of the stupidest movies ever,Pet Sematary is about a family that moves into town and at first things are normal.Then a kid gets hit by a car a the father tries to save him.The next night the boys ghost appears and shows him the sematary. Then his kids cat dies and he burys it in the pet sematary and it comes back. His son gets hit by a car and dies so he burys him in the sematary.He comes back and kills. I found this movie stupid that a 2 year old can be the killer.And the father is an idot because after he kills his son and seems like he learned his lesson he burys his wife and she comes back to life but with a vengence.The movie has bad makeup and just enough blood.The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because of a cool death and some scary moments.By the way Zelda is not scary just boney.
2,"Dark,evil, nightmare movie","I can't see how people disagree with Leonard Maltin about this clunker. It is almost a BOMB. Per Sematary is a mean-spirited movie that is saved from * by being scary, but that can't save how dark it is. For example, were you happy when that woman hung herself? Who wants to think about suicide? Though horror movies are geared to be somewhat dark to be scary, the mean-spiritedness(and sometimes cruelty) is to excessive. Followed by a really dull sequel."
2,FOUND IT KINDA DISTURBING...,"I THOUGHT THIS MOVIE WAS STUPID. I KNOW STEPHEN KINGS MOVIES ARE THE BEST BUT THIS WAS VERY DISTRUBING, FIRST YOU KILL A FAMILY PET, THEN THE KIDS DIES AND YOU TRY AND BRING THEM ALL BACK TO LIFE, WITH SOME VERY BAD RESULTS AND THEN YOU KILL OFF THE WIFE AND BRING HER BACK THE SAME WAY. AFTER ALL THE STUFF AND BAD THINGS THAT HAPPENED UP TO THIS POINT WHY OF WHY WOULD YOU CONTINUE TO DO THIS? SORRY NOT ONE OF STEPHEN KINGS FINEST MOVIES."
5,Remake in the works,"With 4 Stephen King films already remade Carrie,Salems Lot,The Shining and Trucks aka Maximum Overdrive.Now Pet Sematary is getting the remake treatment.What next?"
4,A Historical and Philosophical Tour,"Berlin's writing is geared for academics, but anyone interested in a history of American philosophy or collegiate education would enjoy this book. Granted, I needed to compile a vocabulary list as I read, even so, I came away with a greater understanding of why I was taught writing the way I was, and how a uniquely American view of composition has evolved."
1,Deceptive advertisement,"This advertiser listed Wilcox Squirrel Bait StationSquirrel Bait Station - SQUIRREL BAIT STATIONas a package of 6. When I received only 1 bait station, I called and they claimed that the add was missleading but they only sold them per each. They did offer to send me a return label to return it for credit. We'll see."
2,Buy a box of them...,"This tool is incredibly poorly made. It stripped six 14 gauge braided wires before the jaws stopped clamping and cut exactly one 14 gauge wire before something inside snapped and the cutter stopped working.Having said that, the design is wonderful--particularly if you're working jammed up under your dashboard like I was.I wish I could find one of these made by a reputable manufacturer. Good tools are worth the money."
3,wire stripper,"This type of wire stripper is cheap and doesn't necessarily last all that long, but it is so easy to use."
2,Cheap Plastic Poo-Poo,"I bought this exact item at Autozone for $9.99. It was in blister pack with the ""Dorman"" brand on it. I got hosed obviously.Truth is, this is another one of those Boatload-Outta-China products that are sold under upteen thousand different brand names. You'll find 'em right here at Amazon being sold for just over a dollar under a different brand name."
2,Joe Electric,"Excellent idea with poor quality design. The idea is fantastic and when it worked it was the cats meow! But about 30 strips of 12-18ga wire later the black plastic handle just snapped off right at the hinge joint. Awesome for quick work in tight places, but I would never buy this model again. Off to look for a quality built version..."
1,Nope/,"Handle broke the first time I attempted using it (literally, the first time). You get what you pay for, would have been nice to strip just one wire, at least."
1,The inexpensive wire stripper,"I found this exact same wire stripper at the 99 cents only store for 99cents. After a few trys at stripping wire it broke. I honestly do not recommend this item. It is so cheaply made that it doesn't even deserve the name ""tool"". Why would you pay $5.00 for an exact item that you can get at the 99cents store.....just sayin'."
1,Don't buy this online!,This tool seemed like it had been warn out and it has no strength for wires. It wasn't expensive because it doesn't do its job the way it should. All I have to say is don't buy this! Go to a hardware store and buy a new one!
1,Garbage.,"Wow, those of you who have it just slip off the insulation are lucky. The one I got in the mail is not a stripper, it's a cutter. It completely clipped (CLEAN) every wire I tried to strip...and yes, I was using the stripping jaw, not the cutting blade.Crap. I guess you do get what you pay for."
4,"cheap feeling, but gets the job done!","I find it great for stripping thin wires (i am a hobbyist)! Cheap, and gets the job done! but don't expect it to last long if you use this for heavy-duty work; you're better off getting a durable one then!"
2,Cheap,"If you're looking for a tool for occasional use on small wires for use on a breadboard or something similar, this tool can help keep your equipment cost down. It is easier and more reliable than side cutters or a blade when stripping solid wire for breadboard use. It avoids the small nicks to the wire that frequently occur when using those tools and so prevents the wire breaking easily when bent at that point, as is typical with breadboard jumpers.This particular stripper comes as a bonus item with many other products.The wire stripper portion works fairly well, but sometimes it takes a little fiddling to get it to work just right. An automatic stripper in the $10-15 range is far more effective and will last longer.The plastic around the metal wire cutter jaw breaks after a few uses on larger wires (say, 14 gauge solid copper). After this happens the stripper portion continues to function. If you restrict it to cutting small wires it should be ok if you are careful with it."
2,Poorly Made,I bought two of these and the first one broke after a few weeks. It would last longer if it was made all out of metal. It does strip wires though and would be good for occasional use around the home.
1,This should be minus one star,"I bought one of these things just out of interest, as the design looks good, however I can not believe how rubbish they are. They are unable to strip anything, they barely able a dent in the insulation. I can do a better job with my teeth.I have never before come across a product so pathetically unable to perform the task for which it was made, yet be so specifically designed as to have no other use. They're too light to even use as a hammer. Most Chinese junk works at least once (and usually only once) but these are something else.Do a search on here, these things are listed several times, ranging from $1.19 to and unbelievable $16.58! I paid just over a dollar, and at that price the manufacturer, importer, and retailer are all making money. Let the 'made in China' label be your guide.I ended up sneaking them into a mates tool box, just to get them out of mine. I can't believe I have to give them one star....."
4,Interesting,"If you are interested in telepathy then this book should interest you. It is well written, informative, and just plain interesting. The book is mostly about proving the existence of telepathy and since there is an unusual amount in twins he uses them to site many examples. Easy to read but not dumbed down."
2,DOES NOT FIT TOYOTA SIENNA LE 2001,"Hi,If you are purchasing this sensor for a Toyota Sienna 02 it won't fit right. I had to file the sensor shield in order to make it fit plus the rubber seal for the floor is too small, again I had to use silicone to make it stay leak proof:(The sensor turned off the check engine light as it should."
2,Not a Good Reading Book,"I bought this book on the basis of the above review and was looking forward to a gripping tale of Napoleon's retreat from Moscow. Instead, I found a book bogged down with with the author's attempt to document too many minute details. The writing style is choppy and confusing. I'm sure as a reference book it is very well researched, but it is not at all what I would call a ""good read"". I gave up after several chapters."
2,Poor Audio quality,"I have owned the Panasonic Pure Flat Combo Unit for a couple of months - The DVD and CD Audio quality was so bad when I fired it up that I called Panasonic - they had me send the unit to an authorized repair service for a check. I was told by the service tech. that it meets Panasonic specifications - even though he admitted that the sound quality was poor.Picture quality is good, and having the TV,DVD,CD,VCR and FM radio in one unit is very convenient - no wires to connect either.I just wish that the sound from the internal speakers was at least up to the quality of the other TV's I own. The simulated surround feature is a joke considering the poor quality sound."
4,still germane,"Don't be put off by the book being 20 years old. The issues described by the author are still germane to many urban regions. Johnson explains how development is typically done in an American city. You can use this as a top level guideline about how to proceed, if you are in urban planning.The financial aspects are also crucial. Here, various sources of funding are mooted. Most important could be local or regional banks, whose remit or focus might be for urban projects."
4,Keyspan 2.0 Cardbus initial review,"Thought I'd write this up, since there were no other reviewsas 11/2003 (and because I found other's reviews extremelyhelpful).The Keyspan 2.0 Cardbus 2port USB 2.0 card installedperfectly on my Dell Inspiron 4100, running Windows XP.Windows found all drivers necessary; I did not have toinstall drivers from the included CD-ROM.Data seemed to transfer at a fine rate to/from my newLexar Media 2.0 JumpDrive Pro.I do not have the tools to benchmark performance,but it seemed to exceed the performance of my oldSCSI Jaz drive attached to a 16-bit SCSI PCMCIA card.So far so good! If it toasts I'll review this review!"
2,"Though advertised as widescreen, it is not....",I try very hard to only buy widescreen DVD's. This was advertised as Widescreen and even the plastic case says it is.... but it is formatted to standard TV size. Such a cheap DVD that it is not worth the hassle to return it but buyer beware...
5,Evil Dead,Evil dead is typically a very good game. Fistfull of Boomstick got a freaking 2/5 in most mags i was like WTF. REGENERATION BEATS BOOMSTICK BY 10 points REGENERATION THIS IS A MUST HAVE FOR ANY XBOX GAMER.
1,Why Bruce WHY?????,"I love the Evil Dead Movies, I love Bruce Campbell as an actor, but please quit making crappy Evil Dead games. I'm not sure what game the other reviewers are playing, but this one is utter crap. There are limited saves, so you play the same are over and over and over. You do the same moves over and over and over. And the game is greedy when it comes to giving you extra life. I guess I shoudl add that it is not greedy all of the time. It seems in the areas that you do not need health, there it is...but when you are next to dead, there is none to be seen. I would at most rent this, but why not just play Halo 2 on-line and not waste money on crappy games based on good movies!!!"
4,Love this game!,"I think this game was so much fun mostly because you get to do more things with Ash. He gets to jump and have unlimited bullets, which is nice for once in an Ash game. Plus getting the chance to play two different characters is fun too. Sam is just as funny as Ash and just as fun to play. Also the extras with Bruce and Ted are hilarious!"
5,Cool CD!!! Love it!,"Miss Jones' CD is a must! She's a great singer and every song is worth the listen, excluding the interludes. I heard about her in 1994 on the radio, then heard her again couple years later, however, there was still no album released by her. Finally, in '98, it is released! So long awaited! I'm surprised it's only her 1st album! The album is very enjoyable, my only complaint would be the interludes which aren't really necessary and so I skip them. Best songs on this CD would have to be: ""It's So Amazin',"" ""Baby Maybe,"" ""Two Way Street,"" and ""Rain Down."" This CD is a must have. Make it your next buy!"
3,JUST WANT TO SAY THE REASON WHY ...I GOT THIS IS BECAUSE OF THA SONG SHE GOT WITH MOBB DEEP!,"NOT REALY AS GOOD AS I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE,SHE STILL CAN PUT IT DOWN AT TIMES...LIKE HOLDING IT DOWN FOR THA LATE GREAT BIG L."
5,Christmas by a Soul R&B legend!,"This collection of Christmas music is sung by the legendary Brook Benton of ""Rainy Night in Georgia""! These songs are not the traditional songs covered by everyone and his brother, but some of them are destined to become classics! Brook Benton's soulful baritone makes this a nice CD to curl up with your sweetie by the fire! It is heavy on ambience and romance, just wonderful! If you like Christmas CDs by Gladys Knight, Lou Rawls or any of the Motown groups, you will love this one!"
3,A varied selection of popular songs for pipe organ fans,"This album contains songs ranging from old standards to hymns, all displaying the versatility that the Wurlitzer pipe organ is famous for.While some songs are dated, the selections are popular enough that almost anyone who loves organs will readily recognize."
4,what you see is what you get,"This toy is a cute decoration, the only downside is that it is rather stiff (not a good bed decoration)."
1,The Cow is worthless,"Hey, it's cute, but... if you're thinking about buying it as an investment, DON'T. It's worth so little that you'll get burned."
2,It works but requires awkward pressure on keys,"This keyboard is worth the $23, but that's about it.To play it, you have to press some keys harder than others.Perhaps it is the interface I have with Garageband on my MacBook Air."
5,Good idea,"I am not a mother, but am a vet student and use this thermometer to get fast, accurate rectal temperatures on cats and dogs. I imagine that a mad cat and a baby would equally apprecaite this product. I have double checked the readings I get against the standard ones our hospital uses and the readings have been within 0.1 degrees; so I consider it pretty accurate."
5,ULTRA FAST THERMOMETER,"I purchased this thermometer a couple of months back, and the first time I used it on my baby, it was LIGHTNING FAST, ...so fast, I didn't believe it. I don't even think my baby knew he had a rectal thermometer used on him! I would recommend this to all new parents for it's speed and ease of use."
4,Vicks Speed-Read Digital Thermometer,The large LCD is great. The user's guide uses the smallest print known to man and I cannot figure out how to change the battery. An online user guide would be nice.
1,Worst Thermometer,"Although reviewed as accurate in many sources, this device is both slow and inaccurate. The inability to receive a quick reading will frustrate the user and make the baby very unhappy. Babies do not like to be probed. Be quick about it should be the motto.I strongly advise getting one that reads the temp quickly"
1,"Cool at first, then stopped working","I thought this was really cool at first. Used it about 10-15 times and it stopped working. Got it for $10 at Target. Wish I could take it back. I do like the light-up features, the soft stick that goes in your mouth, and the large read-out. If only it lasted longer. Could be the battery, but most of my batteries for any thermometer I've ever bought have lasted several years before needing to be changed...even after being really sick for months and having to take my temp several times daily ...so either way, that's a major inconvenience. I also felt like my other thermometer was more accurate...I would get several different readings with this one. It boasts 8 seconds and while it is WAY faster than my old thermometer, it's not 8 seconds."
1,Never Accurate!,"I bought two of these, and they were off by 2 degrees! And then one died all together within the first week. What a waste of money!"
2,Good Initially,Documentation was poor as we needed to change the display from Fahrenheit to Celcius. We finally decided to search the Internet to find the answer. The thermometer was great after that but then when we needed it less than a year later it failed us as the battery had died. We had only used it that first time so we basically only got that one use out of it. When trying to open the battery compartment we were shocked to find that it was impossible to open. We have also read other reviews stating that once opened it was impossible to actually find a replacement battery. Makes a great first impression but doesn't weather the storm when you need it later!
1,Unhappy Consumer,"I have a 5 year old, 3 year old and 17 month old. For the past 2 years I have tried to get an accurate reading with this Vicks thermometer and the Safety First digital thermometer. They are both awful! I thought I would get a quick, accurate, painless reading- not at all! My kids squirm they can't stand the feeling of this under their arm, when I do get a reading it reads a temp. of 97.1 to 98.9. I know by feeling their forhead they are burning up, complaining of any variety of symptoms from earaches to sore throats or naseau. I'd just like an accurate reading to now if they have a 101 or 103 fever. Don't wast your money. (I end up using a rectal mercury thermometer on my 17 month old to get it right.) I just read the many good reviews for the Exergen Temporal Scanner Temporal Artery Thermometer so I'll invest some money and purchase it. Let you know in the future if it is worthwhile."
1,Not accurate!,"According to this thermometer my husband had a temp of 100.8 for a couple of days... After violent shaking and chills, we finally decided to go to the Urgent Care, they said his temp was actually 104! We double checked the Vicks when we got back home (5 minutes), and yep, it still said 100.8."
1,!!!! DO NOT PURCHASE THIS THERMOMETER!!!!,"This thermometer SUCKS!! It takes approximately 5 minutes to give a reading and if your baby moves just a bit, the timer starts over so you're waiting 5 more minutes, a total of 10!! And with an infant or newborn you don't have time to waist on this silly thermometer. My baby hates it under his arms, he squirms and cries, in the meantime I'm still waiting to get a reading from it!! I would advise parents to purchase a digital thermometer for the ear or simply choose another name brand, this Vicks model needs to be chunked in the river!!!!"
5,Interesting Die-Cast,"This is a unique, really good quality die-cast. The dual features are as unique and quirky as the character it's based on. The packaging is also nice."
4,"Works great, doesn't taste great","My 5 yr old was bound up for several days. I tried another product, a chewable tablet which did not work. I asked a pharmacist for a suggestion and she told me to try this. It worked within just a few hours. The taste is not the best, but that can be overlooked since it worked so quickly."
1,Nastiest thing you'll ever taste,"The 'little' series is usually pretty good, but this is an exception I've found. My wife, wanting something less nasty than milk of magnesia to help our 2 year old have a bm, brought this home. ""It tastes like chocolate"" is what she said, trusting the label. Our innoccent son tried it and then choked and threw up. Poor guy. I tried it later.... man, was it nasty. It says to 'slowly' administer it to inner cheek. I don't think many kids would go for this. The only way would be mixing it into something already strong tasting and only a few drops at a time. The best is to modify diet and lots of fluids, but good ol milk of magnesia does the trick when you need it."
5,love it!,OMG my lil boy is going to have a fit when he gets this for his birthday! Soooo glad to have purchased!
1,Did not work,"We ordered this for our 3 year old ""Diego nut"" for Easter. I was up late assembling the Easter Bunny goodies and took everything out of the packaging. It did not occur to me to check to ensure he was in full working order. Imagine my disappointment when my son discovered his surprise only to find a Diego doll that didn't talk or do anything. I also ordered the talking baby Jaguar and it worked great. I had already thrown away all the packaging so returning it was challenging. My advice - make sure it works before getting it out of the packaging!!"
2,not what i thought,I thought I was buying the soft life size one. It is smaller than expected and my son doesnt really play with it.
3,"Excellent base, so so seat top",Quality seat as with all DW hardware. Base is really sturdy and well made. The top is not so great. I replaced the top with a roc n soc. Much more comfortable. The DW has a thick cushion but its hard and hurts my back on long sets.
4,Better for people that are not day traders,"This is a great book for those that are trying to understand the theoretical underpinings of short selling. It is probably most appropriate for money managers who are trying to understand the difference between long and short strategies, quants (as a basic book with which to frame short selling separate from long startegies), and generalists. It is not a book for day traders who would do better focusing on charting."
4,Must read for financial academics,"This is an insightful book that makes a great case for the importance and need for short selling. It chornicles the bias toward optimism in the marketplace and this is especially relevant after we have had two bubbles burst in the last 10 years associated with excessive optimism. This is a nice compliment to the work that has been done in regard to capital market efficiency, etc. I recommend this to intermediate to advanced financial-minded people who want a different perspective on pricing and investor motivation. John W. Taylor, Tiarta, LLC"
4,layout,"the layout is interesting for a book that has designated lines and page numbers. Comprehensible, but not the easiest to read."
5,"Excellent: On the field and in Court, Nizer was a God","This book shows one of our greatest legal minds, a close relative of mine, at work. Very few people know that in addition to being a star attorney, Louis Nizer (the author of the book, not myself) was an all- star baseball player in the ill-fated Norewigan pro- baseball leage. This book unpacks both, and Nizers love of felines. A smash hit!"
2,Stop repeating yourself,"Legal thrillers are my favorite genre of books; however, Attorney Nizer either assumes his readers are not paying attention or stupid. I was very tired of the repetition which caused me to put down this book several times. It is a riveting story which makes this book worth while, but be prepared to be annoyed at the author's technique. It might work well with a jury, it doesn't work well with an educated reader."
4,Richie's best effort in years. Borderline great!,Vertical Man is one of three must have Ringo Starr solo works. The playing and production are right on. The style of tune fits the style of the vocals. Great effort.
4,Very Beatlish...13 songs..8 of good...better than McCartneys,"Beatle fans will love this! It is like a Beatle record made in 1967-69. Style and atmospherics enhance this. Background vocals from Tom Petty, Paul, George, Steven Tyler and others mimic the Fab 4. I was apprehensive, being a Lennon fan, but this really is better than what lennon or Mccartney has done since the breakup! great guitar riffs, good lyrics and melodies. Only a few songs are dogs: La De da, I'll be fine anywhere are the few. Being a rocker this is good CD. Allanis Morrisette makes for good beatlish harmonies and the Lennonish electronic tricks are great. Buy It!"
3,"Compared to ""Ringo Rama"", this is pretty pale now.","At the time this CD was released, it seemed better than it does now. What happened since then? ""Storytellers"" came out, which is better than this, for one thing. But the main change making this pale is ""Ringo Rama"". Rama is an incredible, far superior collection of songs and performances than anything ""Vertical Man"" offers. There are only about 3 or 4 of the best tracks on here now that even live up to the bottom quality Rama tracks. All the rest are reduced to boring filler. It was a good continuation in the right direction back in the day. Now that we've heard what Ringo can REALLY do, this one just doesn't stand out above average anymore.If you are picking and choosing which Ringo CDs to try out, Vertical Man should be closer to half way down your list after you already have ""Ringo Rama"", ""Ringo"", ""Storytellers"" and a ""Best of"" set that includes the early '70s tracks that were only singles."
1,...,"I have 5 other TVs with built-in VCRs, each of which works perfectly. This one is awful; the picture is very jumpy, and the remote is anything but intuitive,with many buttons almost impossible to find without good lighting and glasses (and I don't need glasses to read or drive - just to read this silly remote). But the main problem is the jumpy scratchy picture. I'm so unhappy with this that I will never again by Panasonic ANYTHING -- or Quasar, since they now appear to be affiliated with Panasonic (although the Quasar TV/VCR I bought 14 years ago is still going strong). I bought two Magnavox TV/VCR combos from Amazon which were much cheaper than this set, and they're perfect - but this Panasonic stinks. I wouldn't recommend this set to my worst enemy."
3,Traffic in Souls,"The DVD arrived promptly and in good condition, so that part of the transaction was flawless.I purchased this video after a failed attempt to record this off Turner Classic Movies on cable TV. My only complaint is that this DVD version has no soundtrack! No music score --NOTHING! Yes, it IS a silent film (I knew that) but even the TCM version had a soundtrack with music, and IMHO the people who produced this DVD could have provided something on the soundtrack, even if it was canned ""elevator music"" to provide something to listen to."
1,Traffic in Souls,"Although the picture quality is acceptable, there is no score on this version of the film. Very disappointing. Should have been noted in the product details."
5,THE FIRM ROCKS AGAIN!,"The Firm tapes are wonderful and this one was my first one. I joked that for my 40th birthday I got these attachments to my hips in the form of fat. well,I did this tape the 10 times they suggested and although it was tough at first I stayed with it and the ""hip extenders"" i had developed were gone! it was this tape that made me try more Firm dvds and i know i can pick them up and 10 workouts later i'm back in shape. there's so much out there to try but i know that the firm really works. i will say however, that it is heavy on the abs which is fine, but the title didn't warn me about that part of it. and honestly, not much on the thighs. this is more like a buns hips and abs video.the only part of the thigh they hit on was the hamstrings and left out the quads."
1,Waste of time!,"Tried this once and threw it out.Way too easy. I barely felt a burn and laughed every time the instructor recommended a modification for ""beginners"". This whole video is sub-beginner level. Heavy-up and add more reps while Tracy is talking in between moves to get anything out of this.Boring. Instructor is boring. Routine is boring. Outdated and BORING.I would've given this a negative 0 if I could have."
3,Cheap Quality - Dollar Store Equivalent,"What little girl wouldn't love princess dress ups?! Easy to put on and off. BUT.. CHEAP, CHEAP, CHEAP. I would compare it to Dollar Store quality."
4,Cute toy for the money,"I bought this for my 2 1/2 year old daughter after searching for dress up clothes on ebay. People were bidding upwards of $40-$80 for these clothes (with other stuff included). I'm certainly glad I didn't pay that much as the quality isn't fabulous, but the more reasonable price made this a good bargain for her and I'm sure she and her younger sister will get quite a few years of enjoyment out of it."
4,Good for the price,"I bought this for my 2 year old and she loves it! Have only had for a few days and she plays with it constantly. I am hoping that it holds up, because most of the stuff is pretty cheaply made, but it was a good buy for the price. I didnt want to spend alot on a dress up trunk, and some of them are pretty pricy, but I was really happy with this one, it was perfect for what I wanted. It is one of those things that you get what you pay for!!"
3,princess dress up trunk,"My daughter loves this dress up set, but I thought that the pieces would be of higher quality. They are kind of skimpy and you couldn't use them as a costume for Halloween, just for in the house. I would have spent more on one of the fancier dresses if I was to buy my daughter dress up clothes again, but I am not going to return it because she enjoys the outfits."
3,fine for the price,"My daughter loves these dress up clothes. They are a little small so I'm glad we got them for her now, she is 2 1/2. After only wearing them a couple times she does have a few that the trim is coming off already. They are made pretty cheaply. That is all ok thought considering she loves them and they are just for her to play with."
3,Disney Princess Dress Up Trunk,Was a little disappointed in the quality of the contents and the trunk which is thin cardboard but for the price I guess what can one expect? The clothes just fit my 2 year old so I do not suggest this for 3-4 year olds unless they are very small for their age. Also the clothes can not be put into the washing machine - hand spot clean only! The good news is my daughter loves dressing up as the princesses!
3,Cute dress up but the sizing is way off,"For the money, this is a great little dress up set, but.....the sizing must be completely off. It says it will fit up to age 5 but my daughter is size 2T and is average for her age and this set just fits her. It might fit up to 3T. Also, the box is cardboard and a little flimsy. You have to put it together yourself, which is fine, but take the time and use clear packaging tape to fasten it all together to keep it sturdy.My two year old loves this set and that makes me happy. She wears parts of it every day. And there are quite a few pieces to make fun outfits. Seriously, for the price, you can't go wrong. Just don't expect this to fit any child over 3T."
2,Trunk is a waste,"While, the clothes inside the trunk are adequate (barely), the trunk is a cheap piece of easily breakable cardboard. I had to go out to buy a small suitcase for my granddaughter to keep the clothes in. The clothes are very basic. I also subsidized these by buying Disney princess dresses at Wal-Mart. I would not recommend this product. Just buy the pieces and put it together yourself."
4,It's fun to be a Princess,"I actually purchased this product for my friends little girls (one is 2yrs old and one is 3yrs old). It seemed a bit old for them but they loved it and dressed up immediately. The smaller pieces were taken out until they are older (jewelry, etc...) but over all it was a hit. When you get the package in the mail and wonder ""where's the chest?"" not to worry, it's actually cardboard and folds up nicely. It actually arrives all at once with the clothes, you just fold it together. ;0)"
3,An o.k. toy,"This is an o.k. toy. It is not exceptional at all. It does allow the child(ren) to have imaginary play with the different princess characters. I was disappointed with the quality of the material. If I had seen this in a store and actually felt the material, I would not have bought it. The real test for this toy will be the durability of the material after my grandchildren have played with this after several months."
3,Fun and pretty!,"The clothes are pretty, but not very well made and the trunk is cheap. But she did love to try on all the outfits, and it was worth the low price!"
3,Good price...but beware of sizing!,"Disneys Princess Dress up trunk with accessory.For the price this is an excellent bargain. The trunk is made of cardboard, but I could care less about the storage aspect. My daughter (almost 3) loves dressing up and can easily get these clothes on and off by herself. A few of the items are ""well loved"" already but are holding up well. I also washed them in the washer on gentle and had no problems. But beware...! My child is in the 90% for height and weight and some of the tops are very very tight on her! They won't last after a few more months! If your child is average or small you will have no problems but I would guess that the clothes are a 4T at best."
2,Flimsy 'trunk',"While the price is fair at $10, the extremely flimsy 'trunk' doesn't even stand correctly on its own or, for that matter, close. I bought this as a 3rd birthday gift for my daughter and the clothes is snug. So, the recommended age should be from 1-3yrs old. My daughter loves to play dress up so, she was very excited about this set. She has played with it for a couple of weeks now."
4,Dress up fun!,"My daughter received this dress up set for Christmas. It is a nice assortment of dress up items that can be mix and matched for Disney princesses, or any dress up. My daughter is a small 2 1/2 year old, and the clothing just fits over her winter pajamas - I can't see a 4+ year old be able to wear these. Some of the accessories are too big (headbands, jewelry) but she really doesn't mind. We paid about $[...] for our set and am pleased with what we got for the price."
3,Princess Dress Up Trunk,"The ""trunk"" is simply a cardboard box and not very durable. Upon opening it, I found that it was already torn in one place. As a result the lid does not close properly. Our 3 year old grandaughter has enjoyed the costumes but they are also kind of cheapDisneys Princess Dress up trunk with accessory.. I guess, it's not bad considering how inexpensive it was."
3,For small children,"I just recieved this in the mail today as a Christmas present for my niece. I went ahead and opened it so I could put the trunk together and then wrap it. I was very dissapointed in the size of the skirt and shirts! They all say 4-6x, but there is no way my 3 yr. old niece will fit in these!! And she wears a size 3T clothes. My 20 month old child, who weighs 25lbs, would be hard pressed to fit in the Cinderella top! I would only recommend this for a small child, maybe 2 yrs. old...."
3,Serves its purpose,I bought this for my niece who is 3 years old. I thought the two piece dresses would make it easier for her to get in and out of on her own. The quality is not great but I didn't expect much and did feel the price was good for what you get. She loved it and that is all that matters.
5,A Must Read,"This is book 2 in one of my favorite series of all time. Wen Spencer created a very sympathetic hero in Ukiah, you understand what motivates him as well as the other characters in the story. This is a story where you will cheer for the alien. Although the book can be read as a stand alone, it is much better if you read ""Alien Taste"" first. Of course this will make you want to read the whole series--but it's worth it."
4,another good read,"This is the second book in Spencer's series about Ukiah Oregon, and like the first it's a fun scifi/mystery/adventure. Overall the pacing's good, but the ending seemed a little rushed to me. It was still a very good read though, and if you liked the first book you'll like this one too I think."
2,Jehovah's Witnesses Answered Verse by Verse,"All in all, I was disappointed in this book. I left the religion after 45 years so I know the teachings well. Many of David Reed's comments on the verses were not proven with enough conviction that you could actually answer a Witness with his thoughts.He has a lot of opinions, but without biblical backing the Witnesses would not even question their beliefs. I have trouble believing he was ever a devout Witness.All of us have opinions, but without scriptural support, a Witness would not listen.I believe the books by Ray Franz have much more force since he was on their Governing Body and wrote much of the literature. I really enjoyed his two books and believe what he said."
5,The other side of the story,"At last you have a means of answering these brainwashers when they next pitch up on your doorstep. They changed the bible to suit themselves and are well trained in quoting the passages they wrote to support their message. Most people don't look at a bible from one year to the next and don't know enough to show these people how wrong they are. David Reed gives ammunition to fight back with.My wife nearly fell for their slick brainwashing, I'm buying a copy for her, and possibly more for the local Kingdom Hall."
3,Amusing in Small Doses,"Guy Noir is sort of a Philip Marlowe/Sam Spade kind of a guy. His friend of 30 years, Pete, might pass for Miles Archer, Spade's late, lamented partner in ""The Maltese Falcon."" Each skit involves Guy confronting Pete over some incongruous issue. The duo devise deliciously alliterative dialog, but become belligerent, and the burgeoning bellicosity soon embroils them in a gun battle. They invariably wind up killing each other. Cliche's from the golden age of radio drama abound as the two ""friends"" deal with all sorts of modern day issues. My first thought upon listening to the first episode was ""Dr. Phil meets Philip Marlowe.""The first two or three episodes had me laughing out loud, but the longer I listened, the less funny it became. Don't listen to the episodes straight through. Listen to them one at a time, and give yourself a couple of weeks between episodes."
4,"Good, solid Guy Noir","I did receive the correct product and it's pretty good. The stories all share the same predictable plot, but Keillor and company's tongue-twister-type dialogue keep things interesting."
1,Kind of things that are not funny,"The nine stories are funny as usual, the actors are funny as usual, the old Guy Noir kind of thing. However I did not like the shooting scenes. All stories end up with Guy shooting Pete, or the other way around. That's not funny. Ok, I agree, I might have missed the point... But yet its's not funny. I don't recommend."
2,Not what you'd expect,"Whatever it says is the material, this is made of hard stuff that is not comfortable. These pants look odd and they are odd. Also, this is certainly not relaxed fit as advertised. The one I received was way too small, not the stated size. I returned them. Be forewarned."
3,Painter Pants,"Dickies Painter Pants are good quality painter pants however I was able to find a similar name brand and similar quality pant at only $15.00 with painter's discount at the local Sherwin Williams store here in Omaha, NE."
5,Ideal pant in Nubland.,"An absolute necessity for the true Husker fan, these classic white Dickies make even huskermike the envy of Lincoln on game day."
5,"Yeah, these work","Most Excellent purchase. This was much better than expected. I would recommend to everyone, price was perfect, delivery was fast...bought 2 pair"
4,Excellent choice!,"These pants are a little tight around the waist for me, but are otherwise perfect. The pants are well constructed and durable. It's also worth more than I paid for."
2,"Pointless ""upgrade"" with even more pointless bonus tracks",Be warned: sonically speaking this new upgrade is no different that the version of this that was available many years ago. And the bonus tracks are of very recent vintage NOT from when this album was recorded. So if you like drum machines and samplers etc (which is what the bonus tracks use to a very noticable degree) go ahead and buy it. But otherwise you might feel royally screwed like I did after getting rid of the old versions and spending quite a bit of cash to upgrade all the albums only to find that they sound EXACTLY the same!
5,One Crazy Night - A Word From The Director,"Meet London Hilton, drunken jet setter. This time he's had one too many and ends up married to London Latsis (Adam Cootes) after a drunken celebrity driven party at Club 69 in Berlin. Upon waking Hilton gets some good advice from the Marriott Brothers 'RUN Flee back to the US'. Hilton runs and Latsis is right behind him. Chaos and desperation ensue. Sometimes true love can't be denied.Director's Note: If you are looking for a Raiders of the Lost Ark or an E.T., this movie is probably not for you. This is more like a very early John Water's Movie where a group of friends got together and made a crazy movie. If you like early John Waters movies (i.e. Mondo Trasho, Multiple Maniacs, Pink Flamingos and/or Female Trouble), I believe you'll enjoy One Crazy Night.Remember Alcohol is Not Included and a Three Drink Minimum is Recommended Prior to ViewingNot RatedAn Alcohol Not Included Release of a London Hilton Film"
1,Scotts Drop Spreader dropped it on this one,"When one hears the name Scotts, I automatically think ""Quality"". After buying the Scotts Accugreen 1000 Drop Spreader my thinking has changed. When the spreader is fully loaded with fertilizer, the wheel that turns the feeder mechanism in the hopper slides or skips on the lawn (rubber on the wheels probably would help) plus the handle bends when pushing the spreader (a T-Handle with channel iron would be sturdier). I had a drop spreader from another brand that lasted 22 years with no problems. This Scott spreader just appears to use cheap materials. Unfortunately, I bought this on-line and couldn't check out the product in person and relied on the ""Name Brand"". You'll be better off going to Wal Mart and checking out the off brand name spreaders there. Oh well, live and learn."
1,Poor quality,"I have always used drop spreaders and bought this Scotts model when my last spreader broke after 12+ years of good service. It was easy to put together. It is, however, very cheaply manufactured. The tin handles bend easily. The spreading mechanism is easily clogged by larger granules of fertilizer or dolomite lime. The hollow, light plastic wheels skip over the ground leaving patches without distribution. I am amazed that a large company like Scotts would put their name on garbage like this. I suppose they make a good mark-up on this unit, but I will never buy another Scotts product again."
4,Arrived in perfect shape,"This product arrived in perfect shape and went together very easily. It took less than 10 minutes to calibrate it. Since I haven't had the opportunity to use it, I can't comment on it from a user standpoint yet."
5,excellent product,I ended up getting this speader for $3.. I used my $25 gift certificate from Amazon that I got in the mail and this spreader had free shipping with it.. so I think I got a great name brand spreader for $3..you can't beat that..
4,Great Book after reading Rudolf's book,"This book written by the legendary conducting teacher Elizabeth A.H. Green is very insightful and shows the beginnings of conducting from an old master like Malko.I would reccommend buying the Max Rudolf text (used by most major conservatories and universities) for a more substantial basis. Then read this book and get a whole new perspective on several different baton techniques, rehearsal techniques, and conducting in general.My only problem is that I don't think this book is worth the 68 dollars that the publisher is asking. First get the Rudolf (much thicker, more info for a basis, and cheaper) and get this book. It's great despite the price and somewhat limited explanation."
4,Good Conducting Collegiate Book,"My professor is in love with Elizabeth Green, he has met her, and swears by her teachings. The book is very explanatory and has lots of pictures and examples. Although I still think conducting is learned through actual practice. But the book is a good start."
5,GOOD PURCHASE,Very quick shipping. The book was in the same condition that the seller stated. Good purchase! Thanks.
4,Super details for history buffs! Combat Codes is your book!,"The minute I brought this book up and showed it to my brother, he handed me the money and told me to order it for him! He loved it. Had been looking for something like it for awhile. VERY detailed and informative. Great reference book. A lot of research has been done here. Any historian will love this book."
3,Free Kindle version does not have any illustrations,"I downloaded the free Kindle version for my son to read on our iPad (via the Kindle app) while traveling. It does not have any illustrations. Since this book is out of copyright, and the original did have illustrations (and the product description refers to them), it should really include them.I did eventually find a free Kindle-compatible edition of Peter Rabbit on Project Gutenberg: [...]"
5,Daughter Loves It,"Beautiful pictures and the story is, of course, a classic. Great to keep on your phone for times when the child is 'bored' or for long car rides."
3,The Tale of Peter Rabbit,This kindle copy is messed up. The words get cut off. It is unreadable. I am sad that I can not read it. Please fix it.
4,Great condition,This was in great condition and came quickly. I can not wait to give it to my neice for Christmas.
5,A Classic!,Classic story that every child should read. Well made and perfect to introduce little ones to the wonderful world of Beatrix Potter! I am creating a library for my grandbaby of classic childeren's books. This was at the top! A darling story and beautiful illustrations. I highly recommend this classic children's book! Classic and memorable!
2,Not for a 4 yr old,The words are to advanced for my 4 yr old. The picture are cute though. But The lesson is good.
3,Not a lot there,There were more pages of legal/preamble than story. The illustrations are not plentiful but they are good. The words seem right and the price is good.
3,Graphic SF Reader,"The story of a young, gregarious and voracious rodent who can't stop himself from pigging out in a human's vegie garden. Lucky for him, he avoids the usual and deserved case of rabbits when they become pests, and no shotgun pellets for this little critter, as he finally wises up to himself a bit.That is, until Alan Moore's League of Extraordinary Gentlemen 2, anyway."
2,No audio,Where is the Read & Listen part? I expected there to be an audio track reading the story. Very disappointing.
1,Book not the same as ordered,"Someing is wrong with this items inventory. I intially recieved The 3 Little Pigs. I call Amazon to try to fix it and they sent me a different book (something about the moon and stars). I called Amazon again, and they sent me another copy of 3 Little Pigs. Amazon didn't make me sent the other books back, so I guess in the end I got a good deal. But I promised my girls Peter Rabbit and they didn't get it."
2,Very awkward read and the illustrations disappointing,"I remember the tale of Peter Rabbit as a kid and wanted to getthe book to read to my daughter. I like the story, but didn't realize until I was adult how awkward it is written. Instead of writing ""presently"" over and over again, the author should just written in the present tense.I thought the illustrations were going to be vibrant and more modern. ...I was very disappointed when I received the book to find the illustrations were old fashion and drab. As a picture book I was expecting that my daughter could at least enjoy the cute illustrations, but this is not the case."
3,A Book Report on Peter Rabbit - by Mr. Brown,"If I start writing now when I'm not really rested it could upset my thinking which is not good at all. I'll get a fresh start tomorrow, and it's not due till Wednesday, so I'll have all of Tuesday, unless something should happen.Why does this always happen, I should be outside playing, getting fresh air and sunshine; I work best under pressure, and they'll be lots of pressure, if I wait till tomorrow... I should start writing now. But if I start writing now, when I'm not really rested, it could upset my thinking which is not good at all."
4,Peter Rabbit,This is a nice version of this classic. I had not read this story before and enjoyed sharing the tale of this naughty rabbit with my three year old daughter. I have found books such as this which have widthstood the test of time some of the best reading for children and adults alike.
1,Not formatted for Kindle 3.,"Ironically, the Kindle version of this book is not properly formatted for Amazon's flagship product. There are blank pages, and the images precede their respective text, requiring one to page back repeatedly to show the children the pictures. It's a shame this shoddiness rides on the coattails of the printed classic's ratings. Off to archives it goes..."
4,Peter is always a classic but for you collectors the variant is nice too.,Basically the same old Peter Rabbit we all come to know and love but with a spiffy new jacket for Diamond Jubilee. If your a collector then its for you but otherwise for generally reading nothing really new.
5,Worth it,My granddaughter loves to read every time she comes over. It's one of the first things she ask to do. Read this story to me.
2,"Great book, not so great board book","This might seem like a great idea for a ""baby's first Easter"" purchase but I recommend waiting a couple years and getting the full version. The text is edited down, as is normal for board book versions, but it still has far too much text per page. While baby likes hearing your voice and seeing colorful pictures, the most exciting part is turning pages. You will never get through all the text before baby turns the page or gets bored with the current one. If you want a board book with bunnies, get Goodnight Moon."
3,small rabbit hole,"The Tale of Peter Rabbit (Potter)Appears to be a sturdy, high quality book suitable for a young child. However, the format is much to small for a child to enjoy the art work. To see into Peter's world we need a larger hole."
3,Timeless,"A timeless story with charming illustrations. While the basic story is simple, it introduces a child to the concept of an underlying message wrapped up in text. The attribution of human characteristics to the animal world is a wonderful way of getting urban children closer to animals. The constancy of basic emotions portrayed make it an all time classic. The quality of printing disappoints though."
3,TINY book,"Im not sure what this size book is good for! It gets dwarfed on the bookshelf, but its paper pages make it inappropriate for little hands. There are better options out there."
1,disappointment,I downloaded this for my daughter and was really disappointed that there were no pictures at all. Maybe something went wrong with my download but it didnt seem to have a problem. I could see the picture for the cover of the book and the covers of the other books they wanted me to buy at the end but all throughout the book itself there were only words and big blank spots where the pictures should have obviously been. Glad I didnt pay anything for this. I deleted it shortly after as it was a waste of space.
2,Disappointing Abridged Version,"I love the story of Peter Rabbit so I was excited to buy this board book for my new baby, but this version is severely abridged and removes so much of the storyline. It might be because it is a board book which usually have only a few pages. Still very disappointing - Pass on this and opt for a full version of the book."
1,Avoid This Particular Edition,"This small, shirt-pocket sized edition contains relatively few words and very simple pictures, and the book actually looks as though it was compiled on a desk-top PC. The book arrived with several rips on the cover adjacent to the spine. Those wanting a Peter Rabbit book would be far better off purchasing a more conventionally sized, well-compiled version, not this very poor synthetic impression."
1,Avoid the Paperback Version,"Be careful what version you are ordering. It seems the glowing recommendations are for the Kindle version or the hardcover.I ordered 4 copies of the paperback version and all 4 looked like they were printed on someone's inkjet printer. The pages were glued together, the images were grainy, and there was a faint black line running across every page from the printer they were printed on. I am shocked Amazon would sell such a terrible piece of garbage. Luckily they gave me my money back.I have posted photos in the customer images section."
1,Photocopied,"The book arrived as a photocopied version and is terrible quality. I've never received a poor product from Amazon before and so don't usually read reviews. I wish I had now as I would've seen others report the same issue. Don't risk buying this book, just go elsewhere."
4,Nicely done,"Thank you for making a nice ""fixed layout"" version of this classic. It looks gorgeous on the Kindle Fire. 4 stars for the confusion of ""read & listen,"" but I realized it wasn't an app when I downloaded it."
2,Missing too much,This board book version of Peter Rabbit is missing way too much of the original story. It really is too abridged and not interesting at all.
4,Bool for grandbaby,"When my mother passed away 4 years ago I inherited some of her porcelain rabbit collection. One of them was a farmer, so this book made sense. I bought it for our first grandson (due in February) and sent it with the rabbit described above. Just wish the book was a little bigger."
5,Peter Rabbit,If you are looking for Traditional Peter Rabbit then look no further. Great little classic book! Good price. Good shipping! Thank you.
2,Not as advertised,"The ""inside look"" for this book showed color illustrations. When the book came it was all black and white. I talked to a customer service rep and she sent me a second book. It was also in black and white. She said your info was that it was to be in color. I returned the second copy and was credited for the purchase. Your customer service was excellent. The rep even called to check on the second book and apologized for the inconvenience. i cannot recommend this book for anyone with a young child as color illustrations are a must for young children."
2,Very cheap way to get a classic story,"Peter Rabbit is a classic primarily because of its illustrations, and on that most important point, this Dalmatian Press edition fails.The color on the illustrations is over-saturated. The paintings look dark, ""wet"" and blurry. Perhaps the latter is a result of too much enlargement.Thin covers and stapled binding in the great tradition of Scholastic. (sarcasm intended)Still, this cost a buck. (Wonder if it came from the Dollar Spot at Target?) And it does provide a fuller telling of the story than some truncated editions (such asWhere's Peter Rabbit?: A Lift-the-Flap Book (Lift the Flap)). That means your child will enjoy such gems as:""Don't go into Mr. McGregor's garden. Your father had an accident there. He was put in a pie."" (!!!)"
2,Beaten up book,When I purchased it I realized it was used but it just looked horrible! I was very upset by this product! It was a book from some library so it had tape and other junk all over it! It was a good price though!
5,Highly Recommended,"Every now and then a literary work comes along that is magical. ""A Sunday in June"" is such a novel. While being a work of speculative fiction, the book manages to address some tough and very real subjects. The taboos within these pages tend to be in the closets of many families. Without giving too much away, I can tell you that it evokes quite a few emotions (so get out your tissues.) It is a very fast and enjoyable read and is highly recommended.Pamela Walker WilliamsPageTurner.net"
1,Got refurbished version and had to return it twice,"This item had good ratings, and maybe it is a good product, but I purchased a refurbished model and it would not turn on, I exchanged it for another refurbished model and that one kept giving me errors when I tried to copy the information. I returned it and exchanged it for a Lacie--I have several of them and they have always been good and reliable."
1,no me gust√≥!,"pienso que fue un enga√±o, este cd no tiene nada que ver con el Gran Txus Di Fellatio!!! mi dinero se fu√© por el ca√±o :("
1,Predictable and arcane,"The author's attention to detail in the protagonist's preparations do nothing to detract from the sad fact that this book is completely predictable, slow in places to the point of stopping altogether, and desperately unimaginative."
3,NOT WHAT i EXPECTED,"i THOUGHT THIS WAS GOING TO BE A REAL CLASSIC--VERY DISAPPOINTED--NOT REALLY AS MUCH ACTION AS i THOUGHT--BASICALLY A GUY IN A HOLE--THE GENRE HAS GOTTEN ALOT BETTER SINCE THIS WAS PUBLISHED--i ALSO THINK ANY jOHN bUCHAN NOVEL, THINK 39 sTEPS, WOULD BE BETTER."
4,Hard-hitting and brilliant,"Although the book is a little old-fashioned, which makes the it hard-going in places, it's well worth persevering. I particularly liked the dark, paranoid atmosphere and the single-mindedness of the gunman, which meant he was willing to live in a hole in the ground rather than give up. The way the enemies are unseen and the lack of any major characters except the narrator give the book a claustrophobic feel which is really memorable."
5,A top-notch pursuit story rich with political commentary,"Bored, a professional hunter decides to see if he's capable of assassinating a national leader. He's caught in the process, badly beaten and left for dead. But he survives, and the rest of the book is a cat-and-mouse game with the security forces scouring the globe for him.This is a humbling book, for a couple of reasons. First of all, it's a damn gripping read, great fun on a strictly superficial level. Second, it's loaded with political musings on class and social structure that ring as true today as they did when it was written in 1939. Finally, though, it's humbling because it's a reminder that time just keeps ticking. When it was released, the London Times declared it ""Simply the best escape and pursuit story yet written."" Yet if I hadn't come on a link to it from a blog, I'd never have heard of it, and I don't think I'm alone.Which is too bad, because it's a great, thoughtful read."
3,"A Readable, If Dated Thriller","Somewhat dated suspense work about a big game hunter who sets his sights on a notorious dictator--presumably Hitler--in the early pages, but doesn't fire. He then spends the rest of the book on the run or in hiding. The technical side of all this is pretty fun and suspenseful stuff, the book's weakness lies in the character of the hero, whose motivations for both stalking the dictator and refusing to appeal to his friends and government are a little tough to understand for the modern reader. Part of this remedied in a nice twist near the end where we learn the real reason why he first trained his sights on the dictator. However, we are forced to lean on somewhat dated notions of loyalty, honor, disgrace, and so forth in order to accept his playing the lone wolf in trying to escape retribution. Still, worth a read in front of the fireplace."
4,"Interesting, but a little too antiseptic","I felt this novel would have been more gripping had the author not made the main character so ""perfect"". From one scrape to another, from one type of surveillance to the next, this character just keeps on going. A little human error here and there might have made an otherwise average read into a dynamic one. While he did get caught by the German agent, the account of his ""home away from home"" in the mud where he has his tinned beef and whiskey was just a bit too unbelievable. Sorry to let anyone down."
4,If you'd like to disappear,"If you'd like to disappear, consider reading this book for the least appealing methods at your disposal. It's a tale of a man's endurance beyond the ordinary and it becomes so microscopically focused on his effort to disappear that it effectively loses the broader picture of his rationale for having become a fugitive.In spite of its dark nature I never considered giving up on the book because it offers outstanding glimpses into the games our minds often play with us. This isn't the book for everyone, but it's worth the ""getaway"" for those who enjoy negotiating British personalities and mannerisms."
4,Deliciously Dark,"This is truly one of the first masterful thrillers and an incredible psychological examination. Foiled before he can pull the trigger and bring down a vicious European dictator, the main character is captured, tortured, and exacts a harrowing escape. The description of his wounds and the calm demeanor he exacts to flee speak to his strength and commitment to a hidden motivation. Back in his home country he is forced to ""go to ground"" literally and figuratively. This sets up a fascinating part of the book dealing with his ""hide"" and a confrontation with enemy agents that makes the pages turn with speed. A very impressive novel that resolves itself with cunning like the hunter it portrays."
2,Still more from the Second City student ...,"Not the funniest of the Nichols and May albums, this is the duo's first CD. It consists of various piano pieces which they use as a springboard to launch into improv sets. None of them really made me laugh out loud, but more than one are oddly touching. Recommended for enthusiasts."
2,"Something added, may not be for you.","Kidner uses some of modern thought to explain creation and the flood events, not using the Bible for the basis. Readers should be careful not to take all of his comments as the ""Gospel""."
3,It works better as short stories,"OK, I'm biased. One of the four stories that make up this book was previously published independently as ""Resurrection"" -- and I already owned that title when I bought ""Freeze Frames"".I really feel this book would work better if it were openly billed as a group of short stories, rather than trying (ineffectively) to integrate them into a whole. I think part of the reason I disliked it so much is because it tried -- and failed -- to connect stories that should have been allowed to stand independently."
3,Misleading synopsis,"I owned ""Resurection"", which makes up one of the four stories here, when this book came out. The back page synposis was really misleading. I would have enjoyed it more had I never read it.This works best simply as four independend short stories. Any ""connection"" implied in the synopsis is truly misleading, and you'll be disappointed if yo look for it."
5,Great book to interact with your little ones.,"My 21 month old loves to press the circles to hear the sounds or phrases from the book. Its a great way to interact and enjoy the time with your child. On one page, after pressing a circle, the phrase, ""Good job. Well done."" can be heard. Plus, the book is a great way for a child to entertain themselves. I highly recomend this book to everyone that has children. A great way to introduce reading to a child."
1,Not a very vegan cookbook!,"This is not a review for people that want to know how good the recipes in this book are. To be honest, I don't know, I haven't tried a single one. I'm writing this review because I found the book listed under the section 'cookbooks - vegan'. However, even though the book contains some vegan dishes (nicely marked as 'vegan') it is also covered with lamb, lobster and other gross and cruel recipes. So this review is for other vegans like me that don't want to have this cruel stuff in their cookbooks."
3,Condition of Books Overstated by Seller,"On the positive side, the books arrived in a timely way. I believe the condition was not as good as advertised. Some of the volumes were in fairly poor condition. While there were not a lot of markings inside, the bindings were in very poor condition. In fact, some of them further deteriorated in shipment. The volumes are very fragile. I would have purchased the leather bond set offered for a few dollars more had I understood the true condition of these books."
3,Missing Description,"This item needs a description to be worth risking a purchase. You won't know what materials the handle (plastic or wood)or pan (aluminum, iron or Xylan) are made of or if it is even non-stick?"
3,Not the item pictured.,"Instead of the item pictured, I've received what looks as ""Kotobuki Tamagoyaki Japanese Omelette Pan"". Did not try it yet - maybe it is also OK."
1,Um Hello?,Hey the one that said that It's not true to me.Hello?!?!?!Look at what the people are saying!Some or alot are saying she is Fake!So please be quiet.
3,Decent follow up,This is a nice pop tune with a cute video and this is the UK edition with the great Cut To The Chase Club Mix - Radio Edit and Joe Bermudez & Josh Harris Main Mix which both give us sligthly different takes on the song yet keep the feel of it. The video on cd-rom is also a nice feature that makes this cd single worth buying.
5,i luv hilary,"i used 2 hat hilary but now i love her and her music and her singing. i especially like her song ""come clean"". hilary rules and rocks"
3,"Um,People I'm really sorry!And what I said!Please forgive me","I am very sorry people who like this girl,for real she's O.K to me.SORRY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Sorry what I said before."
5,Sing Along Sesame Rocks,"I remember watching this when I was a kid, and now my son and I watch it together. Madeline Kahn singing ""sing what I sing"" is priceless."
3,It was ok,This one came in a 3 DVD bundle. This one was my least favorite and it didn't catch my 7 month olds attention like the other ones.
4,Love the episode- hate the ad,"My kids like this one, because it has lots of music, but not being able to skip or fast forward through the ad at the beginning of teh DVD is a real turn-off. My kids do not care that the purchsase of this video supports Sesmae Street- and neither do I anymore. I have stopped purchasing Sesame Street DVDs because of the blocking of fast forward during the initial ad. Its just too annoying."
2,not as good as other sesame street dvds,"a little disappointed in this, thought it be better, it isnt horrible but its short , old and not real good for a toddler"
5,A Mother's Savior,I found this video at a yard sale for ... It is the only video that my 15 mth old will watch in it's entirety. She is completely engrossed. She loves the songs and I enjoy watching her mimic the movements (Stand Up and Pinch Your Nose). This is a must-have video for all toddlers.
2,Doesn't hold a candle,"This film cannot hold a candle to Burroughs' literary masterpiece. Admitedly, I had high hopes, but I really wasn't expecting it to be this far off the mark. The film misses some of the most crucial and intense social commentaries that Burroughs weaved into his novel. While it would be hard to reproduce a cut-up on the big screen, I felt like too much time was spent on the superficial physical oddities and it seemed as though there was an attempt to make the story linear when it really isn't. It's a decent attempt, but just doesn't capture the depth of what Burroughs was writing about."
3,NAKED NAUSEA,"The fertile imagination of veteran debauchee William Burroughs is here exposed to the utmost extreme by director David Cronenberg. It's about a bug exterminator who gets addicted to the roach poison. He starts to hallucinate and what he sees is so gut-wrenchingly nauseating, it makes you pale: giant roaches that speak from fleshy holes in their abdomens, an alien with fleshy tubes that oozes addictive milky substances into a cup, typewriters that turn into bugs and other assorted ""lunch."" All these critters have one purpose: to persaude the author that his wife is actually a secret agent and must be killed. This he does in a ""William Tell"" fashion, aiming at a glass pitched on top of her head. He misses and she goes down. Bye bye Joanie. I like Burroughs' writing, especially Junky & Queer, but this is just too much. Technically very good, the movie has some truly sickening and potentially psyche-damaging scenes. If you have a sensitive disposition, give this one a miss."
1,"Not for everyone, dark, disturbing, and boring.","The movie felt like a bad trip. It created a surreal world occupied by a person lost in the seeking of physical gratification in a psuedo chemo-sexual haze, while straining for self importance through artistic creativity. Unless you're into this, it may leave you asleep or queasy."
1,something against me?,"this movie has got to be THE WORST and most disgusting movie I have ever seen. it was also damn boring and the plot was really stupid just like in most cronenbergs flicks. why didn't he stay in the adult business? really, when I wasn't trying to keep myself from vomiting, I was having a hard time keeping my eyes open. I can't see any good reason to buy this movie unless you're somekind of a sick bug-o-phile. thank god I borrowed it from a friend. that guy is no longer a friend.I liked the book though."
1,Abominable,"First a disclaimer. I didn't read the Borroughs book. Having watched the film, I have no intention to. As far as the movie goes, I couldn't even begin to tell what the plot wass. The entire journey was nauseating; not due to content, but the lack there of. The only thing that kept me going was the faint hope that it would deliver a strong ending. In this aspect, this movie failed to a greater extent than any movie I have ever seen in my life. There wasn't an ending, it was simply a cut to scrolling credits. The only thing I could do was laugh at the idea that maybe someone made this film with the sadistic intent of wasting the time of any audience that might be compelled to watch. I'm sure you can find a better drug movie to spend your time on if you look just a little harder."
1,Well...,"This film is what people who masquerade as artists produce. Which accounts for much of Hollywood today. This is your film if you like pain. This film is like a puzzle that is just plain cardboard on both sides. One thing can be said for this, it will leave images in your mind that will take far too long to disappear. But then alot of Hollywood ""artists"" just want to get inside your head and disturb you. A picture void of all hope which leaves you feeling dirty and intellectually violated. If you would like to be raped mentally, this film is for you. A drug induced world of pain from tortured minds."
1,Drugs must make it better,Smoke another doobie if you watch this one. Extremely bizarre and disturbing.
1,Worst movie ever,I think Dante's ninth circle of hell is watching Naked Lunch over and over again for all of enernity. This has to be the worst movie ever made. To compare Naked Lunch to Fear and Loathing is assinine.
2,NOT NAKED ENOUGH,"""Exterminate all rational thought."" Packed with extras, the new digital edition of David Cronenberg's adaptation of William Burrough's NAKED LUNCH stars Peter Weller, who plays Burrough's as a monotonic wife-killing misanthrope engulfed by hellish visions. This macabre comedy attempts to makes rational the irrational but does not quite gell as a film. An A for effort."
4,Naked Lunch - a true surruealistic classsic,"""Dr Benway?...""Why is this movie not available on DVD?!!!Peter Weller gives one of the most riveting performances ever seen on film, as he guides us through the nether-world that is Inerzone...Roy Schider shows up in a brilliant cameo as Dr. Benway...The entire film gnaws at your ability to discern between reality and hallucination...The original music by Ornette Coleman provides a perfect counterpoint to the twisted images conjured up by David Cronenberg...This is one of the most absorbing and compelling films I've ever seen."
5,good and surreal,This movie was quite good and I would reccomend it to anyone who enjoys surreal visions. The visuals are spectacular and are not to be missed.
4,super!!,We had to stop coming to the playground because all the kids want to ride on it. And the car looks better in real life than in the picture. It's pretty heavy.
5,Perfect Five year old purchase,"Our son loves this car... fun to ride and looks cool. Kettler makes a great product, it goes superfast, yet is extremely controllable. Only problem is sharing w.the neighborhood kids!"
5,Great car!,"If you want to see your child or grandchild with a great big smile, just buy one of these cars. Well made and stylish, I wish I had bought 2 more!"
4,"Good book for settings, descriptions, and trail flavor","I mainly read the book for research I'm doing on the Oregon Trail. Although this is a work of fiction, I found some very usuable information. For me, reading the novel was quicker than reading a history book, even though I've used plenty of them, too. The story was a little unreasonable, and I don't think Hough had a very high regard for women, since he talks about one lying as all women were apt to do. Still, the story is one of adventure and romance. The descriptions have dated vocabulary, but are nicely done, and this adds to the understanding of the times."
3,"Yes, packed. However, pocketbook sized!","I wish that I had read a bit more on the SIZE of this little gem! The print is very small and, unfortunately, it is only pocketbook-sized. I just want to warn you of its dimensions and this is not even referred to in the actual description of the book itself. Usually, pocket-book sized books are listed as such in the title. I was very disappointed when I got it."
1,Doesn't fit Palm IIIc!,I just wanted everyone to know that this binder attachment DOES NOT fit a Palm IIIc! So if you are looking for something for your Palm IIIc do not get this one! Wish I knew this before buying it and now having to return it.
1,...plastic?!,"I bought this thinking that it would fit the Handspring Visor...it doesn't but that's not Franklin Covey's fault. Just beware all you Handspring owners that this won't work. I'm glad it didn't work however. It's constructed of cheap plastic and isn't very usable for 8-1/2 x 11"" planners. Yuck."
2,Functions Well - But Cheap & Flimsy,Really useful and fits well with a Plam IIIxe. BUT it is constructed of cheap material and has split apart twice and cracked in 3 different places. Get some epoxy if you buy this.
1,$120 for a used book?,This is an out of print 1st edition of a text now in its 3rd edition. It can be purchased from other sellers for two bucks. Why do some sellers with otherwise good reputations make themselves appear like chiselers by jacking up the price on old books that are certainly not collectibles. I've written to them but they don't respond. (Note: Since I published this yesterday the used price has dropped to a mere $50...perhaps the persistence of the review will bring the price into line.)
2,Save your $$$$,"These headphones are not what i expected. The wire leading to the right ear bud is about 12'' longer than the one leading to the left which makes it an awkward setup, especially if your a runner, it hit me in the face continually. These headphones come with an extension for the male plug, this adds about 3 additional feet. Without the extension the cord is much too short and with it it its much too long, once again, not ideal for running, i dont think you could even walk with these headphones on unless your ipod was wrapped around your neck, sound quality is average, if your looking for earbuds get the bose set, its $100 but quality all the way."
4,Classic must have,This classic shoe I have bought in several other colors. These shoes match everything and there is nothing comparable on the market.
1,Description is ambiguous and misleading,"I was about to purchase these in Black/White, but every time i add them to my cart i'm seeing the 'Canvas' image, which leads me to believe these are not 'Leather' as i had hoped. It's very unclear and needs to be updated. I won't risk buying them just to receive the wrong product."
3,Heel blisters,"Got these for my daughter--they looked great and she loved them initially, but she wound up with severe blistering on the back of both heels after wearing them for one day. I'm hoping we can remedy this by her breaking them in, maybe wearing Band-Aids in the meantime. For now, they're sitting in the closet until the blisters go away.BTW, take note that these are unisex shoes and the sizes are MEN'S sizes."
3,"Not the Shoes Pictured, but Seem Okay For Now","The shoes pictured in white/white, were the JPs that everyone has talked about. But the ones I received (with incredibly fast shipping, so that was very cool) were the newer ones that reviewers on other online shoe sites have been complaining about with lower quality, no logo on the tongue, different insole, eyelets lowered into the rubber part providing less ventilation, and so forth. I'm used to Chuck Taylors, so I'm used to the thin canvas uppers, so that doesn't bother me as much, and there is much more padding on the bottom, so that's an upgrade from my CTs. It feels okay, I guess, but I purchased from here thinking I would get last year's style (the ones everyone loves), not the newer ones that other people say is lower quality. These will do for now, I just ask that the picture be updated so that we know what we're getting, thanks."
2,"New Price, Used Quality","Book showed up with marks all over the cover from what looked like tape that had been on the cover too long. Unacceptable. Tryed to carefully remove stains, ruined cover. Guess this gift is now an unwilling member of my book collection now."
1,Not for Pocket size planner,"It's advertised as fitting all the different sizes of Franklin planners. Yes, it probably fits all the hole patterns, but in the Pocket size planner the Palm sticks out of the planner cover about a half inch. Not an ideal application. Plus the cost is a bit ridiculous; fifteen bucks for this little piece of molded plastic? Get real!"
4,Well Worth the Read,"After reading Alexandre Dumas' popular works ""The Three Musketeers"", ""Twenty Years After"", ""The Vicomte de Bragellone"", and ""The Count of Monte Cristo"", continued reading to delve into his more obscure novels is a rewarding experience. ""Memoirs of a Physician"" proves to be an unexpected detour from the standard type of intrigue in Dumas' most noted writings. After reading ""Memoirs"" one would almost find it appropriate to label the twists and turns in the aforementioned works as ""shallow"". In this book, the first in the series of the Marie Antoinette Romances, the reader experiences a look into darker and more sinister events which ultimately led to the French Revolution. ""Memoirs of a Physician"" exudes suspense, alliances and betrayals, humor, romance, longing to be and the becoming itself - all of the qualities that place Dumas' novels among the greatest works of all time."
3,Great book but horrible editing,"The book is great, everything by Dumas is, but every single book published by Boomer Books is absolutely horrible. The names are mis-spelled, the punctuation is all over the place, the words are changed so they don't make any sense, it's awful. At least one typo per page and up ten. Another thing is the Boomer Books version is the first book in the series, usually the first book is called Joseph Balsamo but Joseph Balsamo is also published as the second book sometimes, so be careful."
5,My dog loves these!,My terrier loves these little treats and they stop his whining without packing a lot of fat on his already stout little body. You can't get much higher praise than that.
2,Buy this book and he sells you more,"Sad to say Lawn Aeration: Turn hard Soil into Cold Cash is a complete waste of your hard earned $45.00. Pedrotti offers little information about the true ""nuts & bolts"" of aeration. Rather his entire goal appears to be trying to sell the reader his aeration marketing products! I read the book from cover to cover and found little useful aeration information. I decided to give it a second chance and re-read it two weeks later. In the end I was even more upset with the author and how he keeps coming back to having the reader purchase his ""cheesy"" marketing products. Take it from someone who knows a fair amount about aeration and marketing in general - this book is a total waste of time, money and excitement - it is nothing but a rip-off! Shame on you Mr. Pedrotti - you cannot possibly make money on aeration. Your scheme is to sell elementary school level marketing junk produced by you with a ridiculous claim that it actually works!"
4,A new perspective,"The author based the book on very thorough research enabling the reader ""feel the streets"" of the countries in the Middle East rather than some superfical think tank approach . Thus, not only are the recommendations to the Muslim World quite on target but they also show the West an alternative to expensive military solutions. The developing nations of the Middle East have a lot to contribute to the global economy if they follow their far eastern counterparts."
2,Lacks passion.,"While one is never surprised with the one or two (usually) out of place and sub-par ""message"" songs Ricky likes to throw in each album, the overall lack of passion on this CD is a great surprise and disappointment.Looking for a first time Skaggs bluegrass purchase? Consider Ancient Tones or Soldiers of the Cross. Both exemplary."
4,A few superb numbers,I bought this CD because it had the song Sis Draper on it. There are a few other songs on it that I really love; the others I could take or leave.
4,Generally worked well on Mac OS 10.3 and Windows XP,"I installed this card on a Mac Dual G4 running Mac OSX 10.3 and also on a Dell PC running Windows XP. On both machines it worked fine with no need to download drivers.I did have a problem when I plugged a Zip drive (USB 1.1 device) into the card and put my Mac to sleep. It would not wake up. I don't know if this is a problem with the Iomega driver or USB card. The computer sleep function worked fine with the Zip plugged into the Mac's built-in USB 1.1 port. I've heard there can be some problems with some devices or cards not being compatable with the sleep function, but when I sent an e-mail to Keyspan tech support to ask about this, I never received an answer."
3,Hardly An Evening,"This live recording by the landmark comedy duo is an agreeable curio, but one has to wonder: was it ever really considered as funny as the audience wracked with hysteria find it? The performances of the two are strong -- especially Nichols' exasperated straight man -- but the targets of an officious operator, a shallow starlet and a nagging mother aren't exactly cutting edge. Were they once? They're more like tart New Yorker cartoons drawn to life. I trust the whole show was better -- this album is disappointingly brief. The adultery piece is the best."
2,Bad Thesis... Worth reading to answer the charges...,"This book basically puts forward a theory that the founders just established the Constitution for their own personal economic gain. This book is well-researched, but its premise is totally flawed. Moreover, it tries to portray all of the founding fathers as self-serving and looking out for their own economic interests. It doesn't really explain why some of the wealthiest colonists and statesmen such as George Mason and Elbridge Gerry refused to sign on. Moreover, I'd recommend that any student of the Constitution, study the writings of the framers and the Constitutional debates to answer these charges. I also recommend _The Founder's Constitution_ set, edited by Phillip Kurland and Ralph Lerner. It is an excellent tool for examining original intent. The renowned constitutional scholar, Forrest McDonald, does an excellent job introducing this book and debunking its controversial charge towards the Constitution."
4,Classic Text,"Charles Beard caused a minor scandal when this book was published in 1913. He argued that the Founding Fathers had foisted the Constitution on the country in order to protect their property interests in land and public securities. This was strong medicine 90 years ago when the public still thought of the Founders as demigods rather than conspiratorial politicians.Despite its age, the book reads well and is refreshingly iconoclastic. Since rightwing politicians and jurists still talk as if the Constitution had a divine origin, Beard's message hasn't lost its relevance. However, there's no denying that his book is a one-sided lawyer's brief, which selects and presents only the evidence that supports its thesis while ignoring everything else. No one who has read The Federalist would even recognize Beard's description of it.Modern readers who want a balanced and comprehensive history of the origins of the Constitution should look to books by Forrest MacDonald or other historians."
3,"A must read, but I disagree","Students of the Constitutional Era should own a copy of this book. It has influenced scores of historians since and is the cornerstone of economic, progressive, and neoprogressive history.Personally, I disagree with Beard that economic motivations supersede ideological ones. Anyone who reads this book needs to also pick up a book by Bernard Bailyn and/or Gordon Wood. I feel that some of Beard's positions are tenable, but to look at history from a purely economic standpoint turns you into what I like to call a ""historian of robots."" These scholars forget that people are complex and capable of great ideas, and not always slaves to the whims of economic decisions. Also, they forget that man-made ideas like wealth and class are very ambiguous. Keep this in mind as you read Beard or related thinkers. Please comment for further discussion."
2,Not Sure What To Make of It,"my best friend's daughter was in a car accident about a year ago and has not been able to walk ever since. i can say that my friends experience as a mother was not at all like the mother in this book. there are some good moments, but overall not very helpful to people actually going through this sort of thing. many of the ""mothering"" moments, that the mother seems to want patted on the back for, are so obvious and basic to mothers that her feelings and thoughts were just not useful."
2,Manufacturer needs to verify information in game,"Typically I do not write reviews unless I have something nice to say.We purchased this game because it was highly recommended. My son needed help studying for the National Geographical Bee and we felt this would make learning fun. We discovered the first day that we played, Zimbabwe is mislabeled. I did not bother to dig deeper for other errors on the game but after reading the latest review I realize that there are more errors. I did write to the company about the typo on the games but surprisingly I have not heard back from them. Not sure if I will be buying another educational game from them since they do not seem to value the customer and supply them with correct information or return emails."
2,Could use a proofreader,"We got this game because I wanted to have a fun way to help my daughter with the GeoBee. Every time we play it I find things that the editors got wrong. They left Belize completely out of the game, they have Zimbabwe in the middle of the ocean, and have Zionism being a major religion in Tanzania. So if you are okay playing a game with mostly correct information this is a good choice, if you are bugged by these things--you might not want to get it."
2,Video adjust probs,"loses brightness after a few hours, then too dark to see on screen adjust tools-- then resets every time you turn it off-remote control is ridiculous--the secret service guy carrying the ""football"" with the president has less steps to program a nuclear strike than a panasonic user to brighten his tv"
2,Blew up,Was watching TV with VCR running and suddenly TV goes black....dies....anyone else experience this? Wont turn back on. About to call panasonic to find out if defective. anyone know the numebr?
2,Panasonic PV-DF2700,"I bought this tv to stand alone in the bedroom. It is not hooked up to an amplifier. There is a problem with the DVD sound - you have to turn the volume WAY up when watching a DVD.In addition, you can hear the DVD humming when it is playing.The TV picture tube has been replaced once and is now on the fritz again. It will suddenly go black (no signal) or just loose the signal and play ""snow"" or just come and and out of focus. Debugging this one is tough. I do not recommand it as a TV or DVD player."
4,A dream,"This was the best TV I ever saw, I cant believe how great it is. Anyone who wants a great TV buy this one. Its a great TV believe me. Everything works great. My friends our saving money to buy this dont choose any differ buy this one."
5,the Devilish Ambrose Bierce strikes back,Ambrose Bierce obviously had some fun at the expense of his fellow 19th century Americans with the cynical and sarirical word entries in his wicked dictionary.
3,The Devil,"This is a fairly amusing resource! Not spectacular, but about what I expected - interesting and useful on occasion."
4,a cynic's dream,"as an all around ""artsy"" type and cynic, this witty little number fits my humour perfectly: wonderfully dry yet colourful."
1,Shoddy and unreadable,"One may read all the content online. A preference for unindexed browsing in print may motivate the purchase of a hard copy, but the quality of this offering is so poor, I recommend against it. Its formatting is so awful and distracting, no used bookstore would accept it. It is unreadable. I recycled it in frustration."
4,Bitterly Funny,"The Devil's Dictionary / 0-19-512627-0DICTIONARY, n. A malevolent literary device for cramping the growth of a language and making it hard and inelastic. This dictionary, however, is a most useful work.This ""dictionary"" by Ambrose Bierce is witty, scathing, and totally hilarious. In his characteristic style, he dishes out his contempt and distaste for those societal norms which he sees as foolish, hypocritical, and dangerous. This is not a book to read, but truly a dictionary to reference whenever the mood takes. The aphorisms ring true, even today, and the only real complaint is that we would wish for so much more - the dictionary is ""only"" 219 pages long, and while that is quite a fair lot of words, if only he had left us even more...~ Ana Mardoll"
2,Ambrose Bierce is one of my favorite curmudgeons but,"This edition is not very well indexed. If you go to ""the beginning"" it takes you to a preface. If you go to the ""cover"", on the second page after it is an alphabetic index labeled as ""contents"" but you can't go to it directly. So its a bit confusing. If you do find the ""contents"" you can select a letter of the alphabet and then browse that section. You can search for a word but if its a common word then every time its mentioned in the text you get a hit. For example, if you want to see the entry for ""war"" when you search for it you get several pages of hits for such things as ""award"", ""reward"", ""afterward"", etc."
5,Devilishly fun,"This book is an all-time classic! Aspiring lexicographers take note: this is the benchmark for witty, thought provoking, satirical language analyses."
4,Great Insight into Humanity,"This was first published in 1911. Most of Bierce's definitions still hold just as true today as they did then.My two favorites are:IMPIETY: n. Your irreverence toward my deity.IMPOSTER: n., A rival aspirant to public honors.I enjoy perusing this book and then sharing my findings with friends - who also enjoy it."
1,Beep and no heat,"Followed instructions and press just keeps beeping and will not heat up. Maybe I got a defective one, will try again."
2,Great idea but made with sub standard materials!,"Today we played volleyball and basketball. Easy to set up and really great fun. The downside is the parts on the basketball set-up. The two clip ons on the back of the rim pop off every time we make a shot. Even though the rim stays on the backboard, it tends to tilt either one way or the other. It's just not stable enough. I thought about taping them down but it would make it more difficult to remove when we decide to play volleyball. I wish the rim was metal and didn't bend the way it does. I am seriously thinking about sending this back and up grading to a better unit. Love the game, just not this design of this specific brand."
5,A Really Outstanding Album,"From the opening track Roscoe to the final track You Never Arrived The Trials of Van Occupanther is a really well constructed album. As you listen to each song you cant help but appreciate how the flute, guitar, piano, and electric guitar in the background complement the voice and lyrics of Tim Smith. This album blends together gracefully and powerfully and you really begin to appreciate what seem like alot of time and effort the group must have put into this album. Its been a long time since I have heard something this fresh. Give the album a try I am sure you will like and appreciate it. Stand out track: ""Van Occupanther"" this is a clever and beautiful song."
5,Totally Amazing!,"This band has just released what I consider to be the album of the year! The songwriting, arrangements, musicianship and harmonies are head and shoulders above anything I've heard so far this year. Every song on the album has been masterfully written and they truly ""move me"" emotionally. With each listen I appreciate more and more how truly gifted Tim Smith and Midlake really are!You will NOT be disappointed...buy this album!"
1,Soundtrack for a Renaissance Fair in hell...,"Midlake's ""Van Occupanther"" is simply awful. The best songs on this album sound like the worst of the Fleetwood Mac catalog after ingesting poisonous mushrooms:""While we were out hunting for foodour house was being robbedI caught an apple and she caught a foxso I caught a rabbit but she caught an oxso upon our return, we found everything gonewhich for us was no lossand we started overwith a rabbit and an ox""Lyrics like these are written for drunken minstrels in a reproduction of Mel Brooks' ""Robin Hood: Prince of Tights"".The best thing this album has to offer is its album cover. Seriously, this may be the most hideous album cover that I have ever seen---its unbearable ugliness is its greatest beauty and only redeemable quality."
5,Fresh Sound,Very fresh sound. Very inventive. People who like this CD would probably like Ron Sexsmith and Sufjan Stevens.
4,Interesting pastiche,"Imagine this: Thom Yorke, having just finished Emerson's ""Self-Reliance,"" finds Neil Young (who is carving bars of soap into deer, elk and bear shapes) and they decide to go jam at Blue Oyster Cult's house (I assume Blue Oyster Cult all live in the same house). On the way, they pick up Lindsay Buckingham, who just happens to be out splitting kindling as Thom and Neil, hastily-packed bags slung over their shoulders, a bottle of clear, home-brewed liquid being passed between them, amble by rosy cheeked and smiling. Peeking from the woods on the other side of the (dirt) road is Sufjan Stevens, obscured by trees, who, though unnoticed, tips his hat as if to say, ""I ain't mad at'cha.""Yes, Midlake's influences obscure their songs on the first listen, but give this album some time, and it becomes pure Midlake and damn--oh so damn!--good."
4,A pleasing mix of many smooth alt rock sounds,"for fans of the following albums:neil young - harvestradiohead - the bendsthe thrills - so much for the citycoldplay - parachutesamerica - americagrandaddy - sumdaymojave 3 - excuses for travellerswilco - summerteeththe jayhawks - hollywood town hallreally artfully crafted, easy listening, retro sounding acoustic rock with a nice little indie edge."
3,"Some good, some not so good","Roscoe, Young Bride, Head Home - these tracks are great. I wish that the rest of the record maintained that level. The rest of the record? Try to imagine if, instead of a greatest hits collection, Rhino released a Most Mediocre compilation of songs by America. No Ventura Highway or Tin Man, etc. Just a bunch of songs more along the lines of Don't Cross The River. I'd definitely recommend getting your hands on CD-quality versions of the best tracks, but most of the remaining songs are throw-aways or background music, at best, and utterly boring and unengaging at worst."
2,"Hoodwinked by hit singles, do they not know more than 2 chords?","I was blown away by ""Roscoe"", then I heard ""Head Home"" and thought both these songs were quite catchy; provocative intro and verse, melodic chorus, pretty transitions, memorable hooks. I bought the album and heard the rest, what a disappointment. Most of the songs just dragged on monotonously. The album became an exhausting repetitive whine fest. I tried to listen to it again thinking I would hear something I missed, nope. The more I listened to the same 2 alternating chords (which is what most of the songs sounded like), the more painfully bored I got, it's like I'm hearing the same song with different lyrics 10 times in a row. The hooks/accompanying instrumentation did not add any spectrum or dynamics whatsoever. If you like Roscoe, just buy the single, or the first three songs. Everything after that (except for In This Camp) is not worth it."
2,can you make it through?,"Be warned. This cd is so boring that I have not yet succeeded in keeping my concentration focussed long enough to get to the far end. My mind wanders and there I am, thinking about washing the car or cleaning shoes and... brought back to what I am doing I find that a few tracks have gone by without a trace - at that point I always give up. Life is too short."
5,Funky Acoustic Meets Indie,"I absolutely loved this product. I went to see the band perform live, and they are fabulous. The music is a mix of indie rock with funky acoustic riffs (lots of guitar, piano, and flute). They have a very soulful feeling while also mixing the emotions and sounds of alternative music and even folk melodies. Loved it. Can't wait to buy a new album and go see them again when they return to the states."
4,An unexpected treasure,"I happened to go during the interval of the Nyon Paleo Music Festival in Switzerland across to the second tent to see who was playing. This is how I discovered this little known group from Texas with a gorgeous sound and great harmonies, Midlake. ""The Trials of Van Occupanther"" is a very pleasant soft rock album, interesting and relaxing at the same time. I look forward to their next release."
4,Definitely Give This Band A Try,"I heard of this band through a friend and have listened to this album a few times. What is interesting is that, like many previous reviewers posted, 'Roscoe' is far and away the best song on the album. I thought it was just me...maybe I liked the song so much that the rest of the album fell flat by comparison, but seeing other people agree makes me realize that Roscoe is in fact better than the other songs on the album. I would still check this album out and give it a chance, you may find it to be more consistently appealing than I did. They have a very unique sound that makes you try and pinpoint exactly who they sound like, but you can't quite figure it out. It could be anyone from CSNY to Fleetwood Mac to Coldplay."
4,pretty cool band,"at times sounding like grandaddy or a folked-up radiohead, these guys write interesting songs that demand repeated listenings to fully comprehend. i have heard some sufjan stevens comparisons, but i really don't hear it in the songs. their previous release, bamnan and silvercork, was good but this is better. a little sleepy at times. i wish they would just kick it up a notch or two. worth a try if you care about the quality of stuff in your cd player or ipod."
2,It's Gone With the Wind in France!,This book is a must read for any GWTW fan. Keep score on how many similarities you can find with Margaret Mitchell's classic novel. Plagarism? All I can say is Fiddle-dee-dee!
4,Spiritual Leadership: Moving People to God's Agenda,"We, Christian School teachers, read this and found it very informational. Additionally, it was quite helpful as we learned things that were very helpful in growing and nurturing young leaders of the future."
5,Free your soul,This is a great book that will open your eyes and move you towards God. Not only will you be inspired to see all the beauty around you but your soul will transform and embrace the beauty within you. Two other spiritual books that will have the same effect on you are The Butterfly by Jay Singh and The Alchemist by Paulo Coehlo. Free your soul.
5,A leader is a leader only when his followers follow,"A teacher is not a teacher just because she has teaching skills, a teaching degree, a position at a school, a knowledge of her subject, and a curriculum for her class. She is a teacher when her students learn. Likewise, neither credentials, skills, position, nor good intentions make a leader. A leader is a leader only when his followers follow. Furthermore, for a spiritual leader, getting people to follow you is not the goal--leading them to take up God's agenda and effectively do God's work is. Thanks to Father and Son Blackaby for this tremendously insightful book which has shaped my thinking as a pastor and spiritual leader."
5,Good and serious material,"I purchased this book for a class, however I recommend it for every believer. We are all called to lead in some capacity. This book will help you do so. The title might suggest a dense read, but I found it a joy to read. The Blackaby's have done a great job with this book."
4,Human nature and our impact on biodiversity,"A thoughtful, accessible plunge into the subject of human nature and our impact on biodiversity.Russ Finley, evoking the wit of Studs Terkel, the scientific eye of Jacques Cousteau and the wisdom of Dr. John Gray, takes the reader on a free ranging tour through the historical and current debates on population, biodiversity and the male-female dynamic. Entertaining, educational and always insightful, this well referenced work will have you chuckling as you reassess commonly held beliefs on the environment, politics and the choices we all make in life."
4,Rosemary Clooney at Some Of Her Best,"LASERLIGHT's ""Some Of The Best...More Of The Best"" series is one of the best product lines of their vast (and I do mean vast) and varied catalogue of budget titles. Already a plethora of titles in existence, the Rosemary Clooney is particulalry fine if you cannot find the original sources of these recordings (and in most cases you can't). The disc provides a survey of some of her best work, not in chronological order, but in listening-flow sequence. This is the next best recording to get until SONY decides to issue her classic Percy Faith sessions (on this CD ""Mixed emotions"") and BMG/RCA issue the incredible duet album, a ""Living Stereo"" recording, by the way, with Bing Crosby (properly represented on this CD with ""On a slow boat to China""), although I am assuming they have not done so. At any rate, I have not come across these full albums on CD. Good work LASERLIGHT. Please give us more of"" Some ofThe"" and ""More of The Best""!"
4,"A great book for cold, blustery days.","I just wanna say that you can't beat this price. I had to special-order mine from the publisher for fifty bucks.Also, this book is a lot of fun (for anybody who likes languages). The grammar and syntax are presented very straight-forwardly and the readings are many and varied. The language is beautiful and just feels good; it always makes me wish I were there. (And if this book's a bit old-fashioned, it's no more so than the sagas.)Gangi √©r vel!"
4,"Icelandic: Grammar, Text and Glossary","A very good manual for learning Icelandic. Written in WWII, the lessons are clear, concise and let even rank amateurs gain at least an appreciation for this beautiful language."
5,Showed results after first use and can use without tool,"I have normal/combination skin that can be slightly oily on my forehead but I have major blackheads and bumpies around my hair line. I bought this Microderm., Acne cream without the resurfacing tool after reading bad review's that the tool broke right away. It worked GREAT with just using a pea size amount on the tips of my fingers and rubbing it in my face and neck for about 2 minutes. I had noticeably smoother skin to the touch and I could see a difference in how even my skin tone was after the first use. The blackheads are still there but have faded. I had slightly dry skin around my chin area after the first couple uses. The directions say to use ever other day but I only use about twice a week to avoid dryness."
4,Great CD set to buy if you don't own lots of beastie albums,"Great CD set to buy if you don't really own any beastie boys albums (like me). All the best songs no bs filler. Like a really good greatest hits collection with a couple of extras (namely a couple of new tracks, jimmy jones [original] and 3 MC and one DJ live). Might not be a good buy if you already have all the albums already. Would be 5 stars and the best album ever except it doesn't have ""girls"" which is possibly my favorite song ever and more live cuts (3 MCs and a DJ is tight). This album is tight. Just remember its not like rare cuts or a live album or something its just a really phat greatest hits."
4,amazing,"Sounds of science was a good collection of the Beastie Boy's music overall, but is missing a few songs that i would have liked to have heard. ""No Sleep Till Brooklyn"" and ""She's Crafty"" are not on the store bought albums, but can be put on the albums by custom ordering online."
3,To This I Owe Much Thanks,"After hearing the funked out Intergalactic, which was a rage at a time or something (not that I can't stand it), and with an Anthology on the horizon, I couldn't wait to be introduced. And that, The Sounds of Science, did.Without it, I don't suppose I would have gotten into the Beasties, AND I'm very glad I did. Looking back, this doesn't include the wisest options for a compilation: Too many short hardcore pieces, IE Beastie Boys and Egg Raid. When it comes to introducing ya, it should get you hungry for more. I haven't quite mastered deciding what your first album of theirs should be, but my definite favorite is Paul's Boutique. Once you've got PB, and say, Ill Communication, you won't have much use for the Anthology, especially if you plan on expanding to even more CDs.If you don't already have it, you might look into getting the Alive singles. That is an excellent track."
1,Greatest Hits,"I am a fan to the end, but I am not impressed with Alive. It seems that the B-Boys came up with it from scraps of Hello Nasty. However they threw it on the Sounds of Science to sell their fans a reason for buying a Greatest Hits album. Why do these guys need to give us a Greatest Hits collection? The album should be re-titled ""Sounds of MTV"" This album is targeted to all the Eve 6 and Blink 182 fans. Come on Boys, earn our money give us some new tracks, leave the greatest hits compilation albums to Def Leppard and Poision."
4,Great Listen,"Great Album let's you watch the progression of perhaps the most well known group of it's kind. having been on the seen for over a decade it is fascinating to listen to their evolution from a hardcore thrash/rap band, to their current ecclectic sound that is so distinct today. With benchmark's such as ""Fight for your Right"" to new vibrant material like ""Alive"" it assures that the boys will be around for quite awhile. The booklet is also interesting and above average as liner notes go...a must have for any fan of alternative or hip hop."
5,Best Disc ever,"Beastie Boys' Anthology:Sounds of Science is the best CD ever! At first I'd only heard ""Alive"" and ""Intergalactic"" but now I know why they've been around for a long time. With such cool songs I hope they stick around long enough for an Anthology 2!"
4,"Where is 'Licensed To Ill""?","Was my CD the only one that ""Girls"", ""Paul Revere"", ""Slow Ride"", and the many other great songs from this album were left off? if anything...""Girls"" and ""Paul Revere"" should have been on it!"
5,best,this is the best beastie boys cd ever. it doesnt compare to hello nasty or pauls botique. this cd has rarities in the content that the other cds dont have impecable lyrics and easy to understand. definately the best beastie boys cd ever.
5,THIS CD RULES,THE BEATS IN THIS CD ARE AS HIP HOP AS EVER AND THE NEW SONGS ARE AWESOME. YOU HAVE TO BUY THIS CD.
5,Great overview,"Great overview of an important band. It's not chronological, but deal with it. Except for Paul's Boutique some of their records have been spotty, so this is a good way to start with the Beasties."
3,"Good, not great","My first Beastie Boys album was Hello Nasty. I loved every minute of it. I purchased a few of the older albums, and overall I wasn't to impressed (except for Ill Communication). This Cd has many good songs on it, particulalry on the second disk. As for me, I could do without thier early work, as their work in the 90's has been great."
3,Mixed Up,"Not being a great BB listener I bought this double CD set out of curiosity, based on the raves it got. I'm not really a big fan of this style of music (except for holding a tremendous admiration for Public Enemy which purists would dispute being in the same category at all, I guess).It's very mixed - with some fabulous songs and some dross.If you're not a long time fan I recommend you buy their last two albums, particularly Hello Nasty which I think is wonderful and a great deal more sophisticated than most of the tracks found here."
5,"great retrospective, with two or three songs missing...","i picked up this cd the other day, without even looking at the track listing too hard. well i got home and popped in disc one and was amazed by the variety of tracks, disc two was just as good, but eventually i realized that through both discs, i didn't hear ""no sleep till brooklin"" ""Girls"" or ""she's crafty"" three of my favorite beastie boys songs... whats up with that?"
2,"If you have a cd-r, don't bother.","If you are into the Beasties enough to consider buying this album, you probably have all their main releases. Stick with them. The ""unreleased material"" is unimaginative re-mixes off of ""Hello Nasty"" with a few punk songs gratuitously thrown in. If you are die-hard, have an extra $20, and nothing else is catching your eye, it does have a cool 80 page book with good stories about the songs; But it ain't Check Your Head."
3,"Not the Beastie best, but close",Missing many hits and some included better left out. Go get Licensed To Ill and Hello Nasty then a couple of the others made in between. More worth it in the long run.
4,Great Set!,"I was very impressed with this release. It's put together very well. When I opened it up, I was glad to see pictures of all of the covers of the Beastie Boys' singles and albums. Also included is the kind of booklet you wish was in more anthologies and box sets. Instead of cold and technical liner notes from a mere observer, you get comments on every track from the group itself. And there's a lot of fun pictures inside."
1,Needs to work a little harder,ic has some good music but i would not buy it because he is not real his beats sound the same and he just fits into the same spot every other average rapper does but he just needs to work a little hard on the next cd and find a different producers change up a littlebig mike
5,Nice shoes!,"If you need a pair of shoes to bring out the best of your formal dresswear, think about the Kenneth Cole New York Men's Trip Planner as one of your first (and best) options...I bought it for my wedding and it was the best decission."
2,not funny,dry predictable and frankly not believable. who lives like this? no one! dry predictable and frankly not believable. who lives like this? no one! dry predictable and frankly not believable. who lives like this? no one!
1,not funny,"A friend highly recommended this so I watched one episode. That was enough for me. The canned laughter was annoying but not as annoying as the show itself which basically is about an alcoholic fashion designer and her serious daughter. I saw absolutely NOTHING funny about this show but of course everyone is different... Now that I think about it, the friend who suggested this to me is a very heavy drinker so maybe that's why she thought it was so hilarous??"
5,Ab Fab British series,"I highly recommend this to anyone who appreciates British humor. I happened upon it late one night and fell in love with it. Then it was no longer being broadcast. When I saw the first season was for sale on DVD at Amazon I snapped it up, and grabbed one for a friend. She said I am the best. She had missed seeing it herself. So thank you for a blast from the past."
5,best of British comedy,"Brilliant comedy centred around Edina and her alcoholic (although she undoubtedly aslo tried every other type of drugs available) friend Patsy. The most important things in their lives are shopping (Lacroix darling), lunches and parties. Edina does some work in her PR company every now and then, whereas Patsy seems to make a living having sex with the right people (although she turns out to be a fashion director for a magazine in one of the episodes). Both are obsessed by their figure and age, which daughter Saffie is more than happy to remind them of. It is not suprising therefore that espeically Patsy hates her. Enough material for 6 (and more in the following series) great episodes!If you know the series, you are probably thinking of buying this already, and if you don't it is time you did."
5,Great as usual,If youre wondering if you should own these - you should. I have already purchased the first 3 seasons. They are all great.
3,I love these Ladies,"I am a hard core fan, so I plug in my headphones and laugh my a** off. I enjoy the characters so much that I can tolerate the poor quality of sound."
2,"HORRIBLE SITCOM, GREAT AMAZON INSTANT PRIME SERVICE!",SUFFERED THROUGH 10 MINUTES OF THIS BRIT-COM AND TURNED IT OFF! MUST BE CULTURAL??? ADULT WAS ACTING HORRIBLE; CHILD WAS THE ADULT BAD EXAMPLE OF FAMILY LIFE.
2,Not funny!,"A friend recommended this series. She had found it hilarious but after two episodes I had seen and heard more than enough. Call me old fashioned, but I don't find watching women getting horribly drunk, behaving irresponsibly, and making fools of themselves at all funny. Could it be because I was once married to an alcoholic?"
1,Yuck!,"This was not my kind of show. Brashy women, and not sure if writing was good. Just not my style. Wished I would have read more about it before purchasing."
1,questionable condition,"The book was listed as in ""very good"" condition. There is writing on the outside and the inside of it. I would not consider a book that is written on in several places to be in very good condition. I brought this to the attention of the seller by e-mail. The seller did not reply."
2,ehh,"i didn't think it was overly exciting. parts of it were somewhat interesting, but it just kind of went on and on. i was assigned to read this and was relieved when i finally finished it. it's supposed to be some kind of a love story, but it only tells the feelings of Janie, it doesn't ""show"". From a girl's point of view, i think it pretty much sucked and dont ever plan on reading it again."
3,I heard it was good....,"I didnt actually read most of this book although it was assigned for our english class. I would say it was much too predictable because i picked up on it really well from just hearing about it. Most of my friends said that it was very sad/touching though. From what we read out loud, the dialog was hard to understand, and although there were some rascist parts, it was all in the interest of making a point about rascism, and it certainly did make some interesting points about society. The only thing that really bothered me was that she used a lot of sentence fragments. If you like to read books for fun I think that most people would enjoy it."
4,Sparks Flying...,"From 1974-1975, Sparks achieved the apex of their creative genius. The band was their best, their sound was most distinct, and never since have they written such original ""pop"" pieces that aggressively challenge the accessible ear. Yeah, America didn't know what to do with them, but what else is new? ""Propaganda"" contains some true gold. The aural sensation of ""At Home, At Work, At Play"" rivets me still. ""Never Turn Your Back on Mother Earth"" (which charted in the U.K.)...a ballad for any era. ""Who Don't Like Kids?"" features the biggest blowout on guitars from Trevor White and(?)Adrian Fisher ever committed to Sparks vinyl. All in all, purchase this with ""Kimono"" and you have yourself the Best dish of Sparks in the canon. Here's to the Maels."
5,Another Essential Sparks Offering,"The second album of the Sparks' holy trinity (which also includes ""Kimono My House"" and ""Indiscreet""), ""Propaganda"" is also the one that rocks the hardest. ""Reinforcements,"" ""B.C.,"" ""Something For The Girl With Everything,"" and ""Achoo"" all showcase the quirky lyrics and clever arrangements that we've all come to love and expect from the brothers Mael, but they also feature big, glammy guitars, a big drum beat, and at their heart, a big hook. Weird, wonderful music from a weird wonderful decade."
5,"If it wasn't for Propaganda, what would Pulp sound like?","If Kimono My House was the rock one that Suede loved and No 1 In Heaven was the dance one the Pet Shop Boys built a career out of, then Propaganda is the Pulp album. The combination of seventies keyboards and big guitars, aligned with quirky melodies, shifting tempos and witty ironic lyrics must have been irrisitable to the young Jarvis Cocker. He even looks like he was influenced by Sparks' dress sense on the fantastic album cover. If you've got as much good taste as Jarvis you'll love this album. If you're a Corrs fan you'll think it's weird."
4,mmmmm,"this was an excellent piece. the material and the look were calssic and my wife loved it, which is ofcourse a bonus cuz i want to see it more. i would definitely suggest it."
5,The Best Dietrich CD Around,All of the songs on the album are excellent. The CD contains all of the necessary Dietrich songs and gives an overview of her musical career. The album contains songs from her movies as well.
3,Not bad,"I would call it an average effort by the German cinema genius and put it next to his lesser achievements,like ""Despair"",""Satan's Brew"",""Fear of Fear"",""Lily Marleen"" and some earlier films.It never comes close to his best movies - ""Fox and His Friends"",""Chinese Roulete"",""Mother Custers Goes to Heaven"",""The Merchant of Four Seasons"",""The Stationmaster's Wife"",""In a Year 13 Moons"",""Veronika Foss""."
4,Sixties/Seventies Rock and Roll at its Best!!!,"This 2 cd set is pretty good, lots of Cipolina guitar and good singing but a lot of it has already been released on other albums if you are a Cipolina fan like me. It is a nice collection and has alot of live cuts. The sound is the only problem. It is muffled in a few places and the stereo is weak in others. I saw Cipolina with Quicksilver at the Fillmore many times in the late sixties and early seventies and this album reminds me of Quicksilver alot. I have all the Terry and the Pirates albums on CD and on vinyl and I am glad I was able to add this one to my collection. I wonder if it is available in vinyl. If anyone knows let me know. Ride on Cipolina--wish you were still on earth--"
3,Not up to expectations,Slightly less than what I was hoping for having seen him play in Dingwalls many moons ago. Sound leaves a bit to be desired as well.
4,A True 80's Band,"Spandau Ballet didn't have a huge American run of successful hits. Yet they still seem to capture the feel of the period. Lead by they're strongest commercial single, ""True,"" this CD incorporates the piano led style that every 80's ballad seemed to use. It is when you look past those ballads and see the song writing and arrangements on they're less popular songs, that you start to understand why SB is one of the 80's quintessential bands. This CD isn't for everybody, but is overall a good collection."
5,just a great little toy,bought this for my 8 month old little girl and she loves it. it's a great toy that she can play with alone or with my 2 year old son. they actually both play with it a lot. she likes to stack the cups and play with the little shaky ball. he loves to stack them up and make balls by clicking together the tops. it provides way more entertainment for both kids than i expected so i love it!
5,Baby loved it (and so did his two big siblings),"I got this for my 13 month old cousin and he enjoyed figuring out what to do with the cups (like put one in the other or take 2 apart that had been put together, or tumble a stack down)His older siblings (3 year old and 5 year old) had fun playing with him and his fun stacking toy <3"
1,not good for little babies,"I think this item is hard for babies to handle. it doesn't just go on top, it has to lock, making it difficult to stay and not possible to put the next item. I didn't really like it."
3,It is just ok,My daughter is 7 months old and does not really care about this toy. Maybe because she is still to little for this toy.
2,Beware of sharp edges,"I was excited to get this toy for my 5.5 month old son. However, on day one of playing with this he put the cup in his mouth (he mouthes everything at this age) and he promptly started crying. I didn't make much of it until it happened again the next day. I think the sharp edges of the cups gave him a mini abrasion of his gums. While these toys may be great for older kids, I wouldn't recommend it for infants that have no teeth!"
4,Wonderful toy but a bit hard for little ones to manipulate,"My son's favorite toys are any kind of stacking/nesting cups, blocks, etc. He loves these, but they are hard for him to manipulate. They click together to help the stack stay put, but he has to really pull to get them back apart. I don't know if we got a defective set or if others have experienced this. He usually just brings them to me for help in pulling them apart.I would buy it again, because this is a great toy for us to sit on the floor and do together. Just be aware it's not so great for independent exploration."
4,10 mos old like it,"I bought this for my 10 mos old. He is approaching year old now and still likes playing with it.Pros: Variety! You can stack the cups. You can join the cups together to make five different size balls. You can even stack the cups on non-consecutive cups. Colors are nice and vibrant, with great numbers (although too early for baby to understand them just yet).Cons: Sometimes a little hard to take the cups apart after you joined them together to make a ball. Baby would most likely not have the strength to pull them apart without an adult's help, but that might be a good thing.Also, the little ball serves little point and just gets lost.Overall, great toy and very happy with it. Price is great, too."
3,I think I like it more than my toddler,"I bought this when my toddler was about 9 months old. She just liked to throw the cups around at that time and hear them clatter around on the floor. When we snapped the pieces into balls, she'd chase after them. Now at 17 months, she'll attempt to put them together into balls or take apart the ones we make, but the snapping together/apart is still too difficult. She won't stack them either, but she likes the little yellow dingle ball. This toy is usually forgotten in the back of her toy box, but she'll pull it out to play with now and then...until the snapping together/apart thing frustrates her. In it's defense, however, she has learned her colors from it (if I ask her for a certain color, she'll look for it and give it to me). When she's a little older, I can see her learning numbers (they're on the side of each cup) and size differentiation. I don't regret buying this; I think it'll just be more fun when she's older."
1,The rattle with a smily face fades color,"This toy is overall fun, but I was shocked to find out that the rattle ball with a smily face fades color. My baby puts it in his mouth all the time, and later I found the black color smeared all over the yellow ball. It's a health hazard."
5,Big hit!,"This was a big hit with the 8 month old I gave it to. It was also a hit with my 11 year old who had a blast stacking them;) Great colors, sturdy construction and lots of different ways to play with....all makes for a terrific, educational toy. Price was right, too."
3,"Baby thinks the balls are cool, but mommy thinks they are out to get her.","My son is 7 months old, and I got this toy for Christmas. We have dogs who think his toys belong to them and I thought they wouldn't be that into this. (They Aren't) It's okay. But don't snap all the balls up inside each other thinking to save space in the toy box! I couldn't get them undone, and my husband had a really hard time with it! Also, one of them pinched my skin on my hand when I was playing with it, it hurt really bad and I'm sure would cause lots of tears if that happened with a little one. He has fun chasing them around the floor and using the hole to pick them up, I think it will last as far as his interest, and it's solid."
5,Favorite Toy,"This has been my 15-month-old son's absolute FAVORITE toy since he was six months old. I'm not sure why he's so in love with it, but he is. He likes to slam the cups on our hardwood floors and they've proved very durable (the cups; not our floors). He also adores the jingle ball that comes with the cups. I was afraid we'd lose his precious cups and jingle ball, so I recently bought a second set. The newer ball has a different sound and the newer cups are more difficult for him to get apart, but it's still a great toy. It's also wonderful that the cups are so easy to wash."
5,So many ways to play!,"This toy has so many possibilties: the bowls click together and stack, they can be nested inside each other in bowls, they can be balanced opposite ends on each other, and they can be clicked together in balls. The toy is made with solid construction and seems that it will last a long time.My 10-month old son loves this toy. He likes to shake the jingle ball and enjoys taking the stacked bowls apart. Now that he can crawl around, he'll chase after the balls when they're together. My 2-year-old even gets in the act, clicking the pieces together to make the balls, and she likes that the numbers are printed on the pieces.It's a terrific design and can be used to teach balance, sizes, colors, numbers, and movement."
4,stack & roll cups,Lots of potential for this toy...bought it as a traveling toy since it could be used in a variety of setting. Great in the tub and fun when made into balls. It was too tough for my kids to get a part on their own.
5,Amazing,"Our ten month-old grandson cannot stop playing with these bowls. We babysat for him for a week and had many other toys available, but he gravitated toward the bowls. This will be my new ""go to"" gift for babies from now on."
4,Awesome toy,"My 13 month son has had this toy for 6 months now and still loves it. Hes too young to grasp the counting/stacking concept, but he LOVES to roll and scoot them around the floor. I put them in to ball shapes and he will roll them around for 20-25 minutes at one time, which is about 1 hour in 13 month old time! He also loves to pick them up and slap them on the hard floor to make the noise and clacking sound. This is a wonderful toy and well made with bright vivid colors."
3,okay,At 9 months she really likes the ball which jingles she likes to bang the pieces together and they pack up small into a ball so it is a good travel toy. It is very hard for me to unstick the pieces when they've been made into a ball which means it will likely be impossible for my daughter when she finally reaches that stage. She does seem to like knocking over the tower and holding the pieces in general. The parts are study and I put it in the dishwasher on sanitise setting with no damage. If you get a good price - why not.
2,there are better stacking toys out there,"It's an okay toy. Definately not at the top of the heap. I wish I would have seen it before I ordered it, than I wouldn't have bought it."
1,i hate this toy!,you know what this is ? it's a mess maker? you find them all over and little kids can't figure it out and bigger ones put other toy in it and make a mess. not a fan
3,"OK product, OK value, just OK","This is a safe choice toy to get for a baby. It's not a show-stopper. Get it if you have the extra cash, don't get it if you don't really need it. There are other, cheaper options to entertain your baby.Another thing that I don't see anyone talking about is the plastic in common toys. Plastics are made of chemicals. Babies put these things in their mouths. So I recommend to try and avoid smaller plastic toys that babies tend to put in their mouths so they don't inadvertently ingest harmful chemicals."
1,No Fun,"My 11 month old was not interested. The only part he liked was the yellow, smiley ball that made noise. I had no fun with them; they slip and slide when you try to stack them. We have the regular cups in the nursery at church and the children and adults love them."
5,One of the Best Toys for around $10,"My 11 month old son absolutely loves these stacking cups. The smiley face rattle ball is probably one of his favorites out of all of his toys. Who would have guessed that you could have hours of fun with such a simple toy. Forget about all the expensive toys that light up and do nothing but consume harmful batteries. This is all a baby really needs to keep their attention, at least for a while."
5,hours of fun,"I got this before my son was born and he first used it he when was about 5 months old. He liked banging the cups together. The yellow jingly ball for the top is one of his favorite things to carry around the house. He is a year now, and is figuring out how to stack the cups. He also has enjoyed rolling the balls, spinning the balls, and shaking the balls, with other items inside to make rattles. The cups are indestructable and are fun to use everywhere, including the bath tub and kiddie pool. Definitely a great toy, that is well worth the money for many hours of creative fun and learning."
2,Frustrating!,"This toy looks so fun, and has educational value on several levels, but it turned out to be very frustrating simply because the cups are more than a little difficult to take apart. The children at my daycare were delighted with the colors, and with the whole concept of nesting and stacking, but when they were all nested together into one ball, it was impossible for the children to open them and difficult, to say the least, even for me. Also, they're slippy-slidey when stacked together, although that's not a big problem. I'm really disappointed. I expect to be able to make a purchase with confidence from a respected name like Fisher Price."
5,"A great, basic toy","This is obviously a simple concept-- a bunch of interlocking cups of various colors that make up a tower. No bells and whistles here. (Well, one bell, but I'll get to that). But there's a reason that the classic toys are classics. Both of my boys (currently 9 months old) love these stacking cups. They're not yet at the stacking phase, so there's room for this toy to grow with them. But currently, they love picking up the cups, clanging them together, and occasionally putting things in them. (Putting a cup on their head always elicits a smile also, for some reason). But the real suprise hit is the little yellow ball. They are obsessed with this thing. The crawler will chase all over to get it. (And the non-crawler is desperately sad when it rolls out of his reach). I guess it's a glorified cat toy, really. But, hey, whatever works."
4,One of the best stacking toys around,"My girls are 9 months old and still a little young for this toy, but they do love all the cups put together into the rolling balls. Plus, the small yellow ball has a jingle that they love.Some cool things about this toy:-The colors go in rainbow order (ROYGBV)-Educational numbers-Each matching set that makes a ball has matching symbols on the outside of the cup (stars, squares, circles, etc) so that it makes it easier to snap them together. I'm looking forward to my kids playing the matching game and putting all the cups together with the matching cup!The only thing I don't like is that its really hard to put them all inside of each other and make one big giant red ball (looks just like the Pokemon ball) for storage. I feel really stupid saying that, but I can never figure out why they don't all fit inside--I've tried snapping them different ways and it takes forever to get it right!"
4,Feel good music,"Yep. It's great old nostalgic stuff here. Even if you didn't grow up in England hearing these on the tele when there was no program running, you probably heard some of these gems in TV ads. This stuff is pure instrumental gold! Get both volumes if you can. They take you back to the 50s & 60s with their peppy, creative arrangements by legends like Syd Dale and Alan Hawkshaw."
1,Unsatisfactory for splitting video output for projector and TV,"I bought this thinking I could distribute the output from an iScan Pro video processor to a Sharp front projector and a 37 inch LCD TV. Unfortunately, this unit significantly affects the signal so that low-light scenes have insufficient contrast, Adjusting the controls for low-light scenes results in outdoor scenes looking washed-out.Not recommended."
5,Works Great!,"I work for a school district as tech support. We installed LCD projectors in the ceilings in a few of the classrooms and needed to have the video from the computer project onto the screen while also showing on the monitor. We had some ""Y"" video splitter cables, but they did not work at all. So I purchased these Aten 2 port 250MHz VGA splitters and they work great! Very easy to install and set up, the picture is perfect, and everyone's happy. The price was right also."
5,Very convenient and works great,No more lugging out and setting up the ironing board. This item is so convenient. Extremely easy to set up.
4,Homz Laundry/Seymour Over Door Ironing Board 4785008,Surprisingly built strong and stable. Used this for the first time for a couple of hours and it exceeded expectations. Only imperfection was the cover pad as it wasn't as smooth. I guess you can buy a separate cover for improved use. Great buy for the price.
2,Over-the-door but that is all!,"It says it does not hurt your door, but it did rub the wood/paint on my door. It is also very unsteady, and the metal net under the ironing cover has big slots and the cover is too thin..I just love the over-the-door concept and I did not have the time or the determination to return it, so I still have it"
5,Contents (why doesn't the site have them? ),"Includes the CD's:High Voltage (Australian), T.N.T. (Australian), Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap (Australian), Let There Be Rock (Australian), Powerage, If You Want Blood, Highway To Hell, Back In Black, For Those About To Rock, Flick Of The Switch, Fly On The Wall, Who Made Who, Blow Up Your Video, The Razors Edge, Live - Special Collector's Edition (2 CD's)"
3,"If this box WAS ""just like"" the Led Zep box...","If it was, it would at least be something different than just AC/DC's Australian catalouge in JEWEL CASES stuffed into a box. But that's exactly what it is. Led Zep's box at least had some interesting packaging so don't let the review below mislead you. Being a collector I was more than disappointed to discover this fact, as I already have all of the standard Aussie cd's. Besides the packaging though, the music contained within needs no explaination or further praising. If you don't already have the remastered Aussie editions(circa 1995) then this is a good place to get them all in one. They are much better than the American editions and also include lyrics, picture discs,original artwork,etc. By the way, the three star rating has nothing to do with the music but reflects my views regarding the packaging. Rock on, freaks!"
2,"2 stories about ""working girls""","Well, being a ratherly ""old"" movie I guess that certain scenes for the time were ""obscene"", but compared to the movie ""the Image"" (our first Metzger film) it really sucks! The backround noise is terrible! When they are not talking you have to turn down the volume due to the ""backround shhhhhhh noise"".The movie is about the ""life stories"" of two working girls (one in Paris and one in Munich), it gives a pretty good inside view of their ""daily routines"".Don't expect any hardcore scenes! The best you get is 3 pairs of ""boobies"", but for the time I guess that was already very ""daring""!THe stories are ok.... if you like the 60's.."
2,Recycling their material,"While this series of books is fun at times, thefact that the editors are recycling more and morematerial from their earlier books is starting to getannoying. Come on guys, it's cheating to quote fromyour own books! Make the books smaller if you haveto, but keep it truly all new."
1,let down again...,"You'd think with the money of Disney and modern filmmaking technology that a studio could make a great version of this classic book. Alas, it is not to be with this version of Red Fern.The seeming little things get glossed over like the impact of Billy's first trip into the city. Would it be so hard to shoot the fire escape scene or the ladies laughing at Billy in town? Those things made Billy's character ring true in the book...And the emotional connection between Billy and the dogs is almost non-existent.Good casting and the opening scene is almost directly from the book...After that scene I had high hopes...This film just doesn't quite make it."
2,Wonderfully Mediocre,"I read the book and never saw the first movie. I expected so much from this DVD and it DID NOT deliver. Beautiful scenery, and mediocre performances kept it a float, but it FLEW through the plot. I finished the movie thinking, ""That's it?"" No real character development for the boy, his dogs, or even grandpa. Don't bother buying this for $23-$25. Maybe rent it, or better, borrow it from someone who wasted their money on it. Buy the book, it is SO SO much better."
1,Disappointing remake of the original,"Where the Red Fern Grows has been my favorite book since my second grade teacher read it to us. Now I read it to my 5th grade class. The original movie was very disappointing, as it did not follow the book. I have always hoped that the movie would be remade and remain true to the book. Such was my anticipation when I bought the 2004 release. Unfortunately, this version has the same bastardizations as the original movie and other facets that make it difficult to enjoy. For example, most of the hunting is done in the daytime, even though the narration says it is night. Like the original movie, Billy does not win the coon hunt outright, but rather the real winner declares Billy the winner and gives the trophy and money to him. Many of the highlights of the book are left out, which I can understand due to time constraints, but why can't we get a movie of Where the Red Fern Grows that makes some attempt to remain true to the book?"
2,Where the Red Fern Grows DVD,"I showed this movie to my 4th graders after reading the book to them. They were a little disappointed with the movie. It left out some crucial scenes that lead the reader/watcher to make a connection to Billy and so the movie is not as meaningful as the book. There were lots of tears in the book, not so many during the movie. My students were also disappointed in the lack of details of some of the biggest scenes in the book, the boy dying with the ax, the hunting competion, the death scene. It's a good movie, but no where near as good as the book."
2,Feels like a Hallmark made for TV Movie,"I think the biggest problem with this movie is the casting. The actress who plays the supposed mother living in the middle of nowhere looks like a model, and has very odd and awkward expressions. The gentleman who plays the father acts poorly, the young man who plays the lead character feels much older than he is supposed to be, and plays the part a bit too goody goody for believability. The only part well played in the movie is the part played by Dabney Coleman. This movie feels like a cheap made for TV movie, which is a real shame given the pedigree of the book to which it represents."
4,"Good Effort, but Book is Better","This is a good dvd for a remarkable book that will pull at your heartstrings. A good remake of the film version that will make you want to read the book. It's too bad this film did not make it to the theaters and went straight to dvd. The classic story of a boy and his beloved dog should have been released. Solid storyline with lots of emotional impact, great for family. At least the dvd will get more people to read the book. Hurray for Disney and other studios/filmmakers who care enough about books to bring it to screen."
1,Very disappointing,My son and I read the book together not too long ago. I was so excited to watch the movie and what a disappointment! Some of the scenes were actually laughable. It seems as though Disney threw this together and was unwilling to spend any money on production (coon hunts were filmed during the daytime!) The acting was horrible. With such a wonderful story to work with I am amazed at how bad this movie was.
2,Where the Red Fern Grows,"I thought the acting in this movie was very poor. It also changes the book and it show how devoted the dogs are to the boy or how much real work it took to get the dogs. The hunting is in warm weather and in the day time, very unrealistic. It also does not portray the true poverty that this mountain people we in. I thought it was a poor interpretation of the book."
3,Not nearly as good as the book,"This book lacks so much in emotion and drama. Whereas I cried my eyes out in the book (every time I read it), I didn't even come close in the movie. They left out so many important things. I HATE how they changed the hunt. That was one of the best parts of the novel. I got this to show to my fifth grade class. They agree the book was so much better!"
1,where the red fern grows,"Don't waste your money on this one!!! Buy the original, or better yet, read the book. Dave Mathews is a great singer, but as an actor, he leaves a lot to be desired. The director shows us the child as overly happy, sappy, and a somewhat robotic character who doe not add anything to the film. The only really great actors were the Red Bone Hounds."
5,the wishing tree,"This album is really good!It's not the type of music I normally listen to.Once I heard ""Small and Quiet Things"" at a friends,I bought it.It's well sung and well written,very easy to listen to.I think anyone who buys this album will be pleased.Getting some xtra copies for gifts to my friends.T"
4,Worthwhile read,"I'm a book junkie...especially ""how to"" books on things I love to do (like triathlon.) This one's got plenty of good information, and I like the simpler approach. However, if you're an elite athlete (or wannabe), perhaps this may be too simplistic. Things I liked:- The simplistic approach to training (I just don't have time to break down my build phase into 5 periodized segments :-))- The emphasis on establishing *realistic* goals- The creative training log formats- Many good ideas & suggestions to take away and use in a way that works for *you*.There simply is no one-size-fits-all, magical training program out there that will turn you into a better triathlete. Every person's goals, abilties, time schedule/commitments, and life in general are unique. So, glean some new ideas from this and other good books out there, and design the best program for you. This one, in my opinion, has plenty to offer."
4,"good info, not really suited for Kindle!","I liked the content, a lot! It's clear, and somehow inspiring.But having it on kindle is not that useful, because all the logs pages at the end of the book will be uneditable!"
5,Triathlon Training with a plan.,"I bought this book for my wife who has started down the road of physical fitness. She took classes with a group and learned a lot of what she was doing wrong. She also a couple books on the subject. This book became the one she kept with her and refers to regularly. The opportunity to use the charts to plan an track the progress is great but the background on how and why to space your training and what to expect is well laid out in this book. I read it and someday, maybe, I will join her in the race for better physical health."
2,A Lesser Effort,"A two star cd by Peter Rowan? Well, here it is. It's difficult to tell what Rowan was attempting to accomplish with this 1982 album. Some tracks have a bit of 1950's rockabilly feel, some are non-descript early 1980's rock, and a few (Fool Myself Again, Call It Love, and Primavera Dell'Amore) are somewhat bizzare. At least the weird stuff is more of what you might expect from Rowan, and probably the only ones you'll care to hear repeatedly. As a fan, it's an interesting album, but not one that matches his usual high standards."
4,We Need More Cowbells in the World,This is a great sounding cowbell!! I used this cowbell in my classes to help demonstrate MI theory. Students (college) love it!
5,"Wonderful Movie, Soundtrack Awesome","This soundtrack is wonderful. It contains a wide variety of music, yet they all fit together. The main song by Robbie Robertson is amazing.See this movie, and then buy the soundtrack. You won't regret it."
3,Not the original soundtrack from the movie,We own this movie on DVD and notice many of the songs from the original movie soundtrack written by William Ross are not present. Actually the only portion of his original score is the last 7 minutes with a medley of 3 of the soundtracks scores. I wrote to the composer to tell him how disappointed I was and he said that wasn't his call but the company who distributed the movie and the studio. They decide how the soundtrack is mixed to sell to the public and decide what to put on it. Some movie soundtracks have songs that weren't even in a film. It's all about marketing and not really a movie soundtrack as it used to be several years ago. I have a copy of the actual soundtrack on CD with all of Mr. Ross's music. And I can assure you I enjoy it more than listening to this one.
1,AVOID THIS DVD!,"I have seen this film on Tv in England and it was nearly uncut, with all the very hot scenes between Plato and Hall intact. Yet on the DVD version, strangely most of the scenes were cut! as if anyone would wish to buy the film for the storyline!, Anyway, I was disappointed with the rating, and hope the studio would reissue the film unrated, and with some extras as well, as we come to expect from any DVD release."
4,Give this movie a chance!,"If you like Dana Plato, you'll love this movie. She's a true star with such amazing personality and energy, that I enjoyed watching her. As far as the sexuality of the characters go, Dana holds her own. I recommend this video highly."
1,What 'yu talkin' 'bout? This movie is horrible!!!!,"I brought this video so my boyfriend and I could watch it together, thinking it was going to be pretty intense and racy. What a disappointment! The extent of the raciness was showing Dana Plato and her co-star topless. In addition, there was very little ""activity"" going on between the two of them. Even Mr. Drummond wouldn't be blown away by this movie. And the plot was so incredibly stupid. And sadly, throughout the whole movie I couldn't help but think Dana Plato was totally on something. Her eyes were open so wide that it looked abnormal.I would advise anyone thinking about purchasing this movie to save their money; it's just not worth it."
1,A ridiculous attempt at a lesbian movie,"This weak attempt at a ""lesbian"" movie was completely uninspired and devoid of any grasp with reality. The dialogue was contrived and at times laughable. The script left a lot to be desired. The characters were shallow. The ""love scenes"" were nothing close to reality. The ""flashbacks"" were used as filler make up for the lacking script. This movie isn't good for much but a good laugh. And I did laugh out loud a few times at the ridiculous dialogue."
3,"Slow and pedictable, improved by the presence of Dana Plato","This, unfortunatly has become the final film of Dana Plato, who died of an accidental drug overdose. The film is slow and completely predictable, with no surprises except the lesbian scenes which are filmed tastefully but remain quite erotic."
4,"Surprisingly sexy, but too SLOW!","This was somebody's attempt at a serious film, with a message and everything, but it's really hard to take it too seriously. Dana Plato is cast as a lesbian photo producer who is immediately smitten by the girlfriend of the photographer she's assigned to work with. Meanwhile, her girlfriend back in New York is cheating on her with a new female lover, and when this affair is discovered, Plato predictably ends up in bed with the new girl. Sadly, the seduction scene is one of the weaker parts of this film, and it's all downhill from there. Still, there are some erotic moments, like when the two women take a shower together! But overall, it just moves too darn slow!"
3,Nice gift for 1st cookset.,This was a house-warming gift purchase for someone's first apartment. She was very excited and happy to receive this and uses it often. I'm happy because the price was right.
2,Dated,This reads like an infomercial for socialism. It's setting in England when it was an undeveloped country is a reminder of how far we have come since then and how little socialism has changed.
3,Ridiculous,"Although the book was somewhat interesting, I simply see it as a way for women to attempt to justify pure laziness. Many women have been able to have children and STILL work. As a matter of fact, out of all my friends, the oens who work are the ones who are happiest. They feel like true partners in their marriages and their kids can actually do things for themselves rather than relying on MOM to do it. Another thing? The women in the book claimed that they felt like they were partners in hteir marriages. I disagree. If they were really partners in their marriage, then why couldn't their husbands stay home? Or better yet, why did their husband's careers have to conme first, often at the expense of their own? THat's not a partnership in my opinion. Like I mentioned previously, the book is a very weak attempt to justify laziness. That's all it really is."
1,Hypocritical,"First of all I think that most of the women in this book are degrading themselves by saying that they are not capable of handling a job and taking care of children. Second I don't understand why the women don't insist that the husbands take a more active role in parenting. Third i don't appreciate these women trying to throw stones at working mothers. I certianly have more respect for working mothers. Sorry, but you will never convince me that those kids in Columbine shot up that school because their mothers didn't stay home. THAT in itself is a whole different issue of parenting. Quite frankly the book is sickening and takes women all the way back to the 1950's as far as women's roles. I was particularly appalled when the women claimed that in their partnership marriages, their husbands careers and lives came first. What is equal about that? I'm sure the men DO support their wives staying home because they are getting spoiled out of the deal. I threw my copy away."
5,A Fascinating and Compelling Book,"This book really connected with me. A must read for every woman, no matter what her age, education or background. What really amazed me was that my husband found this book to be as interesting and compelling as I did. Enjoy!"
4,Brilliant first novel,"Sure, it's a bit too long. But it's brilliantly done -- precision prose, a raw naked dive into her character's emotions at the moment she suffers a near-psychotic break when her brother suicides. Part way through I thought the subtitle should be ""How I Became a Control Freak."" Perhaps the people who don't love this book had perfect childhoods, weren't Ugly Chicks, didn't dream of a Fairy Godmother. It's a great story with wildly imaginative detail, and she writes poetic prose. I'll be reading everything else she writes."
4,The pain and joy of family,"I read this book in one sitting. A beautifully detailed novel which explores the various pains and joys families are uniquely able to bring to or inflict upon each other. Given the depth of such pain and joy, forgiveness is both harder to earn and to bestow. Juniper Tree Burning is a fully realized character, and it is a tribute to the author's talents that no matter how low Juniper sinks or how crazy she seems to get, we sympathize with and can even empathize to a certain extent. Everyone's heart is in the right place in this book but that doesn't mean they always do the right thing."
3,Tough Going,"I'm currently reading this novel and finding it very loooong. This is possibly because the main character is so angry and so obnoxious that it's very hard to sympathize or even care what happens to her. In fact, I don't really like any of the characters at this point. I understand what the author is trying to do, and I think she writes really well, but I have read other novels that do this a lot better and more lovingly or at least objectively. I'm considering whether or not to finish the novel."
1,Couldn't finish it; sorry,"There are very few books I have not been able to finish, but this one I finally had to give up on about a third of the way through. For all the reasons the other one-star and two-star reviewers gave. The writing itself is good but the story line is terminally tedious."
2,Well...At Least I Finished It,"I was so glad that I read this coming-of-age-in-hippiedom novel...mostly glad that I didn't give in to my ongoing desire to put it down and forget it. Ms. Long had the guts to stick to it and write it all; the least I could do was stick to it and finish reading it. But omigod...it's really a tiresome read. Are the rave reviews just puffery? The story just plods along with its feet stuck in the murky mud of childhood disappointment, long after the mud should have been scraped off and left behind. Ms. Long's writing is not too bad (oops, damned by faint praise), and she probably got a lot of catharsis writing it all down. But ya know what? Get over it, and get on with it. It's grow-up time."
2,I don't get it,"After reading all the fabulous reviews this book received I couldn't wait to buy it. What a disappointment. So self-conscious and over-written that I only skimmed it. The narrator/heroine is self-involved and tedious. The story is so predictable I knew what the last scene and ""moment of truth"" would be from the first chapter. A big bore. If you want to read a fabulous coming-of-age novel about the children of hippies, then read Danzy Senna's Caucasia."
2,Disappointing,"While this book starts off well, it quickly goes downhill. This isn't just a look back at the muck and mire of a bad childhood, it's a self-pitying, wallowing, drowning in it. I didn't like Juniper/Jennifer or anyone else (except maybe Chris - and you don't really get to know him). I also didn't like the overuse of the ""Ray. My father, my daddy, my dad"", or ""Faith. My mother, my mommie, my mom."" If you read this, you'll know what I mean. All in all, a real disappoint."
1,Bad service,"The product never was received, I had to contact amazon and it was latter revealed by the seller that the mirror I opurchased was broken in shipment and they didn't send a new one or even notify me ."
1,Peasants in Arms,"If you want a more balanced look at the Contra war, try reading Peasants in Arms by Lynn Horton. To say the Contras are significant political force in Nicaragua today, is slightly misleading. The Sandinistas still have a lot of support, and just swept the 2004 municipal elections. The Contras, as the PRN, in their first elections participating as an individual party, won one mayoralship in a small town of the interior."
1,This book is trash,"Having been in Nicaragua before and during the years in question as a wire-service photographer, this book is a load of right wing garbage. Anybody who wastes their money is this tripe is either a right wing nut case or a sucker. Don't believe a thing in this book, it's packed with outright lies, half-truths and distortions."
3,Needs more reality,"Mr. Brown has done a good job bringing forth the peasant base of the Nicaraguan Contra movement, and comparing it to previous ""contra"" movements - the Cristeros of Mexico, the Escambritos of Cuba. I would even add my own comparison, the Antonov ""green guerrillas"" of Tambov, Russia, in 1920-21. Yet these movements did not grow like the Contras, nor last ten years, and the reason is obvious, although discounted in Mr. Brown's book.And that is because the original hypothesis - of being financed and controlled by the CIA and rich exiles - is still valid. Without the Somocista command structure, the money coming in from Miami and Washington, these Segovian highlanders would have been flattened like their historical predecessors and reduced to mere academic footnotes."
