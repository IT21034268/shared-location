3,Interesting form.,"Interesting kung fu style-- Combination of White Crane and Wing Chun? The practitioners seem to have solid stances and not a lot of superfluous or wasted movement. Would like to have seen more applications though-- just a couple in the last few minutes of the video, basically an arm lock and a push. Thanks to Amazon for making these available to rent! Enjoyable for esoteric martial arts video junkies like myself, gives you a chance to see what other styles you're not likely to find at the local strip mall are doing, and to ""try before you buy"". I've bought several videos from the same company as this one on sale cheap, some are excellent, some are lousy, this one is in the middle. Not recommended for people wanting to learn self defense because a) self defense applications are not spelled out clearly, and b) even if they were, a live teacher and a lot of realistic training is needed to make any system work in real life."
4,Excellent advice on cutting fat & increasing fitness in kids,"This is a well organized book with lots of useful advice and good dietary recommendations. I just have two complaints: 1) There is an assumption that heavy kids are heavy because they eat junk food and don't exercise. I'm living with a heavy kid who rarely eats junk food and has always exercised a lot. This message is frustrating, to say the least. 2) The title is a problem. My daughter is already hyper-sensitive about her weight, were I to buy this book (I read it at the library), the title itself would confirm to her that I find her ""fat."" In fact, I would purchase this book, were it not for the title because it is among the best of the books covering the subject, and I've read a number of them. I appreciate the books emphasis on physical fitness. I think a person who is physically fit has a better life and feels better in every way. Parents have an obligation to promote such well being as far as I'm concerned."
5,"Wise, practical, and medically sound","Life is about making choices and owning up to them. Too many kids in America are fat. This didn't used to be so. Times have changed. Here is advise on motivating yourself and your kids. Setting a good example, teaching them how to make proper choices, and educating them for a healthy life. Doesn't neglect exercise. Good recipes. Doesn't require counting fat or calories, just being smart. Put away your guilt and become a leader in your household, here's how. Your kids and grandkids will thank you for generations."
1,Starve your kids now so they can be fat later.,"Another book that teaches kids that being bigger is a personal defect caused by personal weakness, and too much eating. If you just quit doing 'this' and stop doing 'that' you can be just like the other kids. Complete drivel. A waste of money. Find a book that will teach your children about the value of being different, not one that tries to scare them into starved conformity."
3,If John Sayles adapted a Joseph Wambaugh story...,"Evenhand is a very impressive accomplishment: a quiet, thoughtful cop film. Its premise is familiar: two very different personalities working to adapt to each other and to the many demands of their jobs as patrolmen. So it's very much a character study, and the two principal actors -- Bill Sage and Bill Dawes -- do an excellent job of realizing their characters. As the film's energy is derived from their characters' different natures, it would have been very easy for each of their performances to become charicatures. They did not. In each, you see a fully-dimensioned person, including echoes of his partner's traits. That's good acting of good writing.I also enjoyed the matter-of-fact style of the film, which reminded me of Victor Nunez's wonderful and under-appreciated Ruby In Paradise."
2,Not So Good,"This product I bought and not only did the top break when I opened it, the wipes dried within a day so badly I had to reseal in a ziplock bag. The wipes leave a milky film on my stainless steel refridgerator that I buff off with a mitt designed to clean stainless steel I got from Bed Bath and Beyond. Alone this product does not work as they say, I don't recommend it."
2,Not great,"I bought these because I liked the idea, but the wipes always leave streaks and dry out too quickly. I definitely won't buy them again."
2,Terrible streaking,"I've tried this product many times using different methods and every time I end up with horrible streaks all over my applicances. I'm not the only one. Do a search on Google (...) and read a ways. It seems hardly anyone is satisfied with this product. Others recommend using Weiman's or Bar Keeper's Friend. On the plus side, it does seem to clean the stainless steel surfaces well if you don't mind the streaking."
1,Not even worth 1 star.,"What a pile of junk. Three full seconds pass between pushing the shutter button and when the camera actually takes the picture. If you move at all during that three seconds, the picture is a blurred mess. Even if you don't move, the pictures turn out blurry and dark. And if you use the flash, you get a lovely white picture of nothing. I can't believe they sell this thing."
1,Camera trouble,"I received this camera for a birthday present and I am not satisfied at all. As others have said, it takes FOREVER in between pictures and it drains through batteries very quickly. I have been having problems with the flash also. If I use the flash, my pictures turn out to be nothing but white. If I do not use the flash, the pictures turn out black and red. I would not recommend buying this camera."
2,beware,"I got for Christmas, it was easy to use but only lasted 1 day then the screen does not turn on,,,stay away from this one!!"
2,Meh,"It's an ok camera. The pictures tend to suck because of the ridiculous blur you get. I also can't figure out how to get it to work as a webcam. The instructions don't tell how, which makes it worse. Don't get this camera. There are much better ones you can get for a bit more money, that won't cause you problems."
2,james nocerino,"the camera takes a long time between pictures to regenerate for the next picture. Compared to other digital camera's this has presented a problem for the two users I purchased these camera's for.Also the flash does not adjust for the correct exposure at protraits within 3 to 5 feet. the pictures are too hot, over exposed and no adjustment works properly."
1,STAY AWAY FROM THESE DVD'S,"I HAD THE WORST EXPERIENCE WITH THESE DISKS, i'm being completely honest, they burn fine and everything seems to be working but then when you try to play the disks in dvd player or use them later on they SKIP AND FREEZE CONSTANTLY!! I have no idea how many of the disks were defective in my stack of 100 probably all of them, but I spent weeks worth of my time burning dvd's and all that time is WASTED, belive me this is the first complaint i've ever wrote about a product, such a waste of my time, i don't even care about getting a refund"
1,What the ....?,"I bought these very same DVDs a few months ago and they worked great. I could get them to play on all of the DVDs players in my home (even my Sony Playstation 2) without a problem. Now not only will they not play in my PS2, playback on the other DVD players is glitchy, sometimes skipping entire sections of the movie and other times going back a few chapters. The only place I could get them to playback without a problem was my computer. What's going on here Memorex? I should note that although every indication on the spindle packaging indicates that these are the same DVDs I ordered before the recording side is darker and even the label side is different. My advice? Go with a different (name) brand."
1,complete CRAP,"I went and bought these dvds and a burner that was 16x,and + - formats at BestBuy. I went throught the Whole stack and they burned fine untill it got halfway throught the disk, and then they would error every time. I bought a single disk of another brand and they burned just fine. These disks are Complete Crap!!!! I took all the ""Coasters"" back to BestBuy and they let me to exchange them. I bough TDK this media works great.MEMOREX SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Avoid - Made in China,"With the increasing number of dogs ill with kidney and liver disease related to treats made in China, my vet has taken our SCWT off all treats made in China. Since then his liver and kidney enzymes have returned to normal. We are sticking to made in the USA natural and organic treats."
5,A Wonderful Johannes Passion,"This is quite simply the best recording of the St. John's Passion to come from anyone in the last 25 years. Suzuki really makes the dramatic narrative come alive in the recording-- it's tremendously exciting music. The tempi move quickly enough that the music doesn't get bogged down in itself, but at the same time Suzuki as a tremendous ear for subtlety. The opening is one of the most chilling experiences in all of Bach."
1,Awesome design and features but Aweful fingerprint reader,"I bought this external hard drive because i thought that it looked cool and that it had a fingerprint reader. BIG MISTAKE!!! Yes this hard drive looks sweet but the truth is that it take 50 tries before it reads your fingerprint, If your lucky. Countless times i try and try but it says my fingerprints are not that of a registered user. Stay away from this hard drive, buy one that is just encripted, NOT FINGERPRINT!!!"
2,What strange fate?,"Nothing strange here. All but a handful died.While the build-up to the wreck was interesting and well written with lots of colorful background - once the passengers find themselves on land the information dries up, the story telling falters. Half way through the book you learn that only about 5 or 6 of the crew survive and then the rest of the book is a hodgepodge of speculation as to whether of not some of the passengers might have survived and lived on in Africa.I bought this (used) based upon the reviews. It was probably worth the $2 or $3 I spent."
4,Different!,Well researched and a very differnt type of 'sea going adventure'. A bit difficult to 'get into' at the start but the finish is worth the effort.
2,A great story lost on wordy writer...,"The story of this shipwreck is truly fascinating and adventurous, however I was continually annoyed with the writers focus, direction, and superfluous diction. This true story could have been told in a much simpler fashion, ultimately making it so much more interesting."
2,"Good story, bad storytelling","This book could have been less than 100 pages and be very good. The author throws in numerous side stories that have little relevance to the Grosvenor. It really detracts from the flow of the story. Very annoying, a chore to read."
2,A better book needs to be published on MSMQ 3.0,"This books does have some working examples.I felt that the book lacked in the clarity in how to setupthe msmq for routing which is extremly important for enterprise applications. Like alot of books, the start of the book was a very good introduction, then the author slacks off and misses out a few explanations here and there and the examples in the later chapters then don't work. Would have been nice if the author provided some examples to demonstrate msmq problem architectures. Very messy in the end."
2,Looks like a xerox of a bad photocopy,"Maybe it is just my copy of the book, but it looks so cheaply printed as to be distracting. It looks like a xerox copy of a bad run off from another printer. The text is sometimes so garbled it is hard to read.On to the technical review...The technical portion of this book is weak. Most of the material is the same as the MSDN help (very vague and nonhelpful).In particular I HATE it when books give you a ton of examples and they are all the exact same as the MSDN ones (and wrong to boot). For me the overall review of the technology was ok, but the implementation is very weak. Most of the book assumes you are running in an Active Directory environment and I am not. And almost all of the examples in the book are localhost type of examples. Who is going to bother will all of this for an app that runs on one machine?"
2,Pluffies Dangles Monkey,"I ordered this monkey because I discovered that plush toys are difficult to find during the summer - evidently this is a seasonal item.The picture depicted a child hugging the monkey, so I thought this would be a perfect item for my very young grandson. When it arrived, it was much smaller than it appeared in the photos and reviews. I was very disappointed. I ended up getting a larger monkey from a friend (who collects monkeys, as it turns out) and sending THAT to my grandson.It is well-made, and Ty is a great brand, it's just that it was too small. . . even for my one-year-old."
5,Monkey...where are you???,"Grandma purchased this monkey for my daughter on her 1st birthday. It was an instant favorite and she doesn't travel anywhere without it. I love when she has put it down somehwere and can't remember where it is. She'll walk around the house saying ""Monkey...where aaaaare yoooouuu???"" My daughter likes sucking on the tail so he does get rather nasty and smelly but luckily he washes really well and stays relatively soft. As monkey goes everywhere with us, I thought another one was a necessity. I accidentally got the large version of Dangles and when I pulled him out of the box and handed it to her, she stared at it, picked up the REAL monkey and walked off. (Did mommy think she could pull one over on me?? I think not!) So, since large monkey won't do, I'm buying the REAL monkey...just in case. I gave Dangles 5 stars cause I know how much she loves him and how happy and secure he makes her feel. Definitely worth 5 stars in my book!"
1,not same monkey,"After comparing my granddaughter's Ty monkey to the one on the website, I thought it was the same. Well, she hates it! It is not the same, totally different fabric, like a slick polyester, not the soft cotton out side, and the inside is different and the eyes are buttons, not sewn on!!!! Darn,This monkey pictured is the same in all the Amazon sites for this!!But it's not the same !! I'm bummed, Joni"
3,cute,"The monkey is very cute and my little boy loves him. However, when I received the monkey, I noticed it has button eyes contrary to the advertised description."
3,plastic eyes,"Pluffies used to have fabric eyes, but they have changed to plastic. I bought the money because when I looked at the reviews and the picture it seemed to still have the fabric eyes, but it doesn't. I'm frustrated that they made this change because they used to be perfect for babies and toddlers to sleep with, but now they are too dangerous."
5,Great Stuffed Animal,This is a great stuffed toy. It's an adorable monkey and makes a great gift for any little kid or adult who loves monkeys. It's easy to wipe clean if the kids spill something on it too!
5,my son's lovey also,my son loves this monkey so much I had to buy another just so we don't have a tragedy if we lose monkey. my son loves to sleep with monkey either in his arms (soooooo sweet) or wrapped around his head(lol)!
4,LOVE THIS LITTLE GUY,"My grandson love this little guy. This little monkey is Mr. Dangles to us. My little grandson, 6 months, smiles when given Mr. Danlges and will smile as soon as he sees the monkey. I have yet to wash this little guy. I like the fact that it can be thrown into to washing machine instead of being spot clean."
3,A Pluffie is not a Beanie Baby,"Okay, call me ignorant, because I didn't read the description close enough. So when I got this LARGE Beanie Baby made of terry cloth, I was surprised. It's cute and soft and cuddly, so I can't take that away, but really I was expecting a Beanie Baby. So shame on me. The doll is about 10"" high and only has beans in his feet. The body is stuffed and the fabric is similar to terry cloth, like you find on your bathroom towels, which of course makes it great for washing. So, overall a good stuffed toy, but be cautious if what you're looking for is a Beanie Baby. ;-)"
5,cute & soft,"still hasn't replaced his beloved favorites, but my 2yr old son likes it and he tells me the monkey is cute. Texture is soft and the features are clear so a child can identify that it is a money."
5,love it,needed a second monkey that was identical so my son doesn't freak out when I go to wash the original. He sucks on the tail and tag and it had to be the same monkey I couldn't fool him with any others! Quality and shipping was excellent!
5,dangles the baby monkey,"this is my favourite pluffie, with its sweet cheerful smile and soft cuddly body. i have given this monkey as gifts for friends and relatives, and as baby gifts. no age limit. this toy will delight any recipient."
1,Nice looking Camera - terrible pictures,"This is a very nice looking camera and as a basic point and shoot (which is what I was looking for) - it has a lot of nice features. Pictures taken with the wide angle lens are pretty good - however, when taking any type of close up picture any slight hand movement will result in a blurry picture and the image stablization feature does not help this. The colors are OK - not great and on an auto setting the flash will go off anytime you are indoors - even in good light , resulting in a washed out photo. You have to manually turn off the flash which is annoying.Also, takes a long time between pressing the button and taking the picture and even longer before it is ready to take the next picture"
4,purchased used-reconditioned FE-200 camera,"This is my second FE-200 --- like the small size and wide range optical zoom. A friend dropped #1, so this replacement gives me continuity and duplicate charger, battery, and memory stick. Drawbacks -- lack of viewfinder in this and most small digital cameras is a major drawback in daylight. This camera sometimes fails to focus well in macro mode, or I need to improve my technique with it."
1,Not as good as it should have been,"The buttons are too small for a normal prson. You cannot see your picture in the view field all the time. I could not get the macro portion to work, all the pictures I took with it are fuzzy."
4,GReat product,The only bug I found is that that flash has to be turned off every time you change the settings or turn off the camera and is used again in other day.GReat zoom
4,"Great mix of songs by a swinging, sophisticated singer","This cd is a good mix of torchy and swinging material, and Ms. Cain's voice is smooth with a little touch of smokiness, like a good whisky. Last Christmas I gave this cd as a gift to several folks who were not really jazz or blues people. And everyone loved it!"
4,Songs to put you in THE mood,Wow! What a great CD. Cindy Cain has a real gift for evoking passion and emotion. Her voice is a pleasant change from the quirky femme fatale of today's pop culture. I look forward to hearing her live in concert.
2,Little framework....just running around killing things,"I got Asheron's Call: Dark Majesty two days ago and am still running around confused(after many hours of gameplay). When I sit down at a game, I like to have some idea of what the game is about. The new player training is great: it's structured, you aren't just running around killing things, and you know what to do.However, when you get into the game, except for a few quests all this goes away and you are left to ""level-up"" your character by mindlessly running around killing things. This is boring.Diablo II, has an excellent storyline, structure, and actually makes you feel like what you're doing is for a reason or some goal; rather than killing just to get your character level up."
1,This game couldn't possibly stink more...,"Unstable...is the bottom line. I think I lost track of the number of patches I have had to install. The graphics are nice, the gameplay is poor, and the lag is friggin terrible. Funcom is losing more and more customers each day from this game. I got caught expecting the best and signed on for a 6 month mistake. Don't do the same. Wait for a game that actually tests their software and executes successful betas before they release. This CD now serves as my drink coaster to remind me of my mistake"
4,"Great Game, But ......... One problem","AC/DM is a great game, new land to explore, new quest & weapons. You'll spend hour after hour playing this. All in all this game ROCKS !!, But, Housing :( If your not one of the lucking ones and found a house when AC/DM was first released. You'll have a very hard time finding one. (...) Since it came out I've been looking for a house (any house) with no luck. The only waty to get one is if one of your friends has one and is leaving AC. Or Trubine add more housing. Other then that THIS GAME ROCKS."
5,"Great Books, Great Value","This product contains three of the most action packed novels by Tom Clancy: Patriot Games, a book about Irish terrorists bent on killing Jack Ryan, which is far superior to the movie; Clear and Present Danger, which is deeper than the movie, but slower moving, and The Sum of All Fears, which is destined to the theater, has a plot of peace in the Middle East and an excellent ending. Well worth the price."
5,Outstanding,Great. Clancy's three best books in one. Impossible to put down as you never know what is going to happen next.
4,Used to cut branches,I bought these as they were cheaper here then in store. I used one blade to cut up small 6 inch branches. It worked great in my reciprocating saw. I have not used them on anything bigger yet.
5,Great blades. Aggessive!!,These blades will cut a small branch off a tree in no time. No need for a chain saw if you don't have large trees around your house.
5,Bosch pruning blades,"Blades came as ordered, should work fine have not used them yet. Received them in the time period as advertised."
4,blade,"A wonderful,sharp ,versatile blade. The site has lots of good gear but postal rates to Australia are of concern.I find it very annoying that some manufacturers won't let you ship to Australia...what happened to the Free Trade Agreement between Australia and the US?"
2,AZ Twilight a Good Read? Really??,"My sister and I were born and raised in Arizona, so she read and was amused by some of the stories written in ""Twilight."" She loaned me the book and I read about half, then stopped as I found myself not ""reading"" the ""stories,"" but rather editing the stories for lack of content, and absence of background on many of the supposed episodes. It appears some of these tales are simply exerpts taken from newspaper articles, with few coming from actual persons to whom tales were related. Real tales - with the build up and background creating the ghost story - could be exhilarating and even educational.I am not about to tell anyone else to avoid a book - your likes are not necessarily parallel to mine, nor mine to yours. Still...if you are expecting good, well structured ghost stories, you will not find them here."
5,Exellent book,"This book is well written,keeps your interest through the whole book, entertaining yet fulfilling. I also enjoyed her book The President's Mother"
2,Poor construction,"1. Description of product gave almost no information. (Did not mention that it was battery operated or was a vibrator.)2. Electrical connection was defective. I had to repair it myself.3. Instruction manual was written for multiple models of vibrators, NONE OF WHICH COVERED THE MODEL I received.4. Product ordered arrived promptly. Package in good condition."
5,My Favourite Show this is a Classic,This a anther great DVD set4 Discs set hope they will release all the seasons of this classic show keep them coming....
3,Untouchables Season 2,"Good performances and good entertainment. Highly fictionalized account of federal agent Eliot Ness, but well worth watching."
3,non buyer,i watched the untouchables while growing up and i liked the show very much. I wont buy this set until it comes out in complete yearly editions not broken into 2 vols. this is total greed and we have to stop it by not buying until they change.i would like to have all of them but not at the expence of paying double.
3,The Untouchables,"The first two episodes are very factual from a historical perspective. The remaining episodes, while interesting, are mostly hollywood fiction. Yes, those people were real, but I don't think Eliot Ness ever dealt with them. Most of them, I think, were dealt with by the FBI. The book that Mr. Ness helped author ends with the disposal of Al Capone. So, to say that the first two episodes were based on that book is absolutely true. To continue to say that the remaining episodes in the series are based on the book is pure fiction and a figment of hollywood's imagination. Does this make it bad entertainment? Absolutely not!! You just have to keep in mind that it doesn't follow actual history very well."
5,Feels like Im back in time!,I use to watch this series when I was young the early 60's I have always liked the series and would recommend it to everyone. Great performances and actors!
5,Very interesting & entertaining,We are enjoying the history in these episodes very much. The acting is great & the stories are very interesting.
3,"And now back to ""The Untouchables""","I really wish CBS/Paramount would release this series in whole season increments instead of Season 1 vol.1, etc.Having said that, another enjoyable set of episodes. The highlight of this set was the bonus episode ""Lucy, the Gun Moll"" from ""The Lucy Show"". I never knew that Robert Stack guest-starred on the show playing a Ness-like agent, 3 years after the end of ""The Untouchables"". It was interesting seeing Stack as not quiet Ness in color."
4,Hijinx in Peru,"Tim and Elsie are in Peru when a friend discovers an Aymaran tomb. The possibility of gold excites the local tomb robbers and murder follows. Aaron Marc Stein writes a good mystery with a dash of King Solomon's Mines. Though his Engineer, Matt Erridge is still my favorite of his leads, Tim and Elsie are great too. Hopefully these books will come out in e one day."
3,JBL JSR400 review,"I found that the jsr400 is a very competent reciever for the price. I was looking for a reciever that could a lot of inputs and this was the best. I use the 2 VCR inputs for audio for my CD recorder and Cable audio connection. The sound is good, but there is no loudness button to boost the sound, and the bass and treble needs some help,luckly i have an equalizer. The remote is great, it has the function including the power function. The bad things is there was no manual when I got the reciver, and I'm still trying to get it from JBL."
4,greatness does not always come with looks,at first when i saw this stereo i thought this looks bad. but then i looked at the specs and it rocked! this product is also great for price. it was cheaper then then the others but had the same great features .i am buyig a home theater stereo with all different components so when i saw this it went great with everything. this product gets 4 stars from me because everything was great except for the looks. so overall this is a great product.
4,"Street Atlas USA 2007 ok, not great",I bought this a few months back and have used it quite a bit. The maps look good although i havn't noticed much change from version 2005. There are still some mistakes in the maps and they are still behind on being updated. A little slow to load on both computers but it does fine after it gets going. It has alot of nice features that make it convenient to use. The phonebook is very nice!
3,Amazing and disappointing all at once,"DeLorme focuses much of their energy on point-of-interest and business listings, while neglecing to update the actual street mapping itself. Some of the rural highway maps are so outdated, I wonder if DeLorme makes any effort at all to obtain current information. On the other hand, I absolutely love the US/Canadian phone directory. It is an interesting feature, simple to use, and integrates well with the maps. Street Atlas 2007+ is a great resource if you're spending some time in a major city. However, I wouldn't entrust it with the job of routing your next cross-country vacation."
5,Bite sized factoids to stir thought,"Mr. Belzer breaks down a few of the most talked about controversies in recent history into small, bite sized facts and viewpoints. This man is not a fanatic, just someone who is clearly well read and thoughtfull. I truely enjoyed this book. You can sit down and read one of the small chapters in three minutes, or read the whole book in three hours. The simple, but suprisingly thought provoking points he makes are great food for thought."
3,Entertaining Fiction,"I enjoyed the book, while dismissing most of the conspiracies. It can be done! What brought the rating down was the lack of photos and/or illustrations....anyone can accuse, give us your proof! And not by telling us to buy someone else's book, either. Otherwise, a city dweller like me who has never seen a flying saucer can have a good laugh!"
5,Loved It!!!,"Found it funny, interesting and thought provoking. A great read.The dry humor, wit and uncanny ability to view conflicting ""facts""does make one wonder who really are the crazy ones."
4,"great,but flawed book","this is a great book for people who are just beginning to question the way things are.i have to admit,i didn't believe half of what belzer writes,buthe sure presents it in an entertaining way.heres something spooky-he includes a quote in his book from aldous huxley-did you know that he died on nov.22,1963,the same day as president kennedy?oooh!Spooky!"
5,One of the greatest books of all time,"One of the greatest books of all time. A must-read. However, don't buy the book with a credit card. It can be tracked, and you don't want that to happen."
4,Belzer needs to write sci-fi!,"Belzer reads his findings and theories on these defining events of the 20th Century. Though comic in his sardonic tone and satiric asides, there is nothing funny about the content. Richard lets us in on his obsession with dark brooding over the cover-up and continuing conspiracy to hide the truth of JFK's assassination. More to my interest is his delving into the government's UFO denials. Belzer has a knack for making these seeming coincidences and possible explanations totally unbelievable. He also quotes and refers to other information gatherers as his sources. I just may have to seek out more of this stuff."
4,"Entertaining, thought-provoking & frequently hilarious.","Richard Belzer, my black-suited hero Munch from TV's Homicide, has committed his near-obsessive skepticism for all things governmentally explained, in this very funny book. The title is a bit confusing, though. There is not one word about Elvis in the book! A few chapters into it, I began to wonder if ol' Belz was just purporting a few conspiracies of his own. It was at that point that he congratulated anyone who was unsure about HIS theories! I felt vindicated. Parts of ""UFOs, JFK and Elvis"" are laugh-out-loud funny. But I'm still wondering why he didn't mention The King, as in the title. Perhaps it was just MY copy that was missing intelligently investigated chapters about Elvis. Hmmm. Do I sense a ... conspiracy????"
2,"next time, stay a little longer before writing the book","this book is a little bit ""silly"" in the sense that the western impressions of cities like Kathmandu and Darjeeling are so over-dramatic it is hard to take seriously. the author surely went through a great deal of culture shock, as many westerners do on their first visit to Nepal and India. however, I get the sense that this author wasn't in these areas long enough to truly gain a practical understanding of the East and Tibetan medicine. he made this very detailed and thorough medical approach appear a bit ""chinsy""...I would say this is not a very good way to learn about Tibetan Medicine or South Asia"
2,Magic Eight Ball,The text is hard to read and is outdated. They should change the words to make it more fun. Also would be nice to have other languages available.
5,Can't live without a magic 8 ball,"I have had a magic 8 ball for years and broke my last one, realized when I moved back to the states that I could go and buy a new one and Amazon had the best price. So happy to have it back in my room for that quick question ...which answers that usually make me laugh!..."
2,2/5,"The answer always seems to be ""upside down"". After a little extra shake, it will work properly. There are bubbles too, makes it hard to read sometimes."
3,Still fun..,It's still the same Magic 8 Ball we had in the 70's..good easy fun. They haven't changed it a bit.
4,Magic 8 Ball,"We used this for a Christmas gift exchange game among adults, and it was a big hit - except the triangle with the answers wouldn't always float to the top. Other than that, we had a good time asking it questions, and it was kind of right each time. Really fun, and the woman who ended up with it for her gift at the end of the night was thrilled to have it, due to her nostalgia about it, and she also was eager to show her young kids how to play with it at home."
5,Recommended For Kids Of All Ages,"This is simply a classic! I never had one as a kid, and as a result I was unfocused and directionless. Fortunately, I now have one in my office, and it helps me greatly in my professional life. I highly recommend the Magic 8 Ball for kids of all ages, but be sure to note that if you know the answer to the question before asking, the crystalline matrix of the special magical blue solution will become deionized, and thus, cause the Magic 8 Ball to generate random, spurious, and possibly incorrect answers. Fortunately this is a highly buffered solution and resets to a neutral pH after every question, thereby restoring functionality.I recommend this for silly fun for the whole family, and especially for politicians, who, as a group, would make overall better decisions after consulting with the Magic 8 Ball."
3,Bubbles can leave you answerless,"I teach and bought three of these to add a little fun to the classroom.It certainly did and it was great to see the faces of the children (and adults) as they asked their sincere questions and delight in the right answer or ask again if the answer didn't satisfy.I teach english to spanish children and this 8 ball really forced them to focus and speak as I had said it would only respond to English.A great toy.....but.....after six months,all three are now next to impossible to read as bubbles have appeared within the port hole and they seem to spawn at an ever increasing rate.Now it is no longer as effective and I now have to ask the students to try and decipher whats written."
5,Magic 8 Ball Rules,"1. The Magic 8 Ball Will not function correctly if asked a question to which you already know the answer (i.e. ""am I fat?"")2. Do not ask the Magic 8 Ball the same question twiceUsed correctly this ""toy"" will render unprecidented insight and advice..."
4,Funny Toy!!!!,"My cousins and I had a blast asking the ball questions and shaking it to find out the 'answers'. It's very creative, and surprisingly, it can keep you occupied for hours at a time. It's classic, but kids still love it today. Parents, you'll be amazed what kinds of things this toy can spark in your child's mind.Not my favorite toy, but worth having around for those rainy days when you just HAVE to know whether Mom's making lasanga again or when you are DESPERATE to find out whether Tim will ask you to the school dance. Buy it!"
2,Times have changed.,"This was a great toy when I was little many years ago. I was so excited to pass this enjoyment on to my son, but the ball doesn't do much - of course it never did. In this age of super fast, overstimulating games it seemed so dull. It was also very hard to read the triangle cube - it never fully flattened against the window and the dark liquid blocked it out. The ball is what it is and my son does still play with it, but it is not in the top ten. I should have learned when last Christmas's Magic Rocks bombed."
3,magic 8 ball,a gift for 7 yr old granddaughter. cute for awhile but imagine it ends up in the toy box at the bottom of the heap
5,Magic 8 Ball,It's a little gift with an amazing effect.I recomended to all! Always get the right answer with no mistakes.Regards!
2,This brand Magic 8 ball,"This one is made in China and the quality is not that good.The answer piece inside does not function that good and some of the words have defects so you can't read some words that well...but you can figure it out. Also the ink inside is really dark and because the piece inside does not lay properly for reading...it is hard to see some of the words through the dark ink.I would have got a different brand name model, and definitely not one made in China; as the items coming out of China are made cheaply are not very good quality."
2,Very disappointed,"It worked the first few times we tried it, but now it doesn't settle right and the answer is barely readable. Maybe this version is just a poor reproduction of the original."
2,"Sadly, it was nearly unusable","I've wanted a magic 8 ball for years---one of those tiny little childhood wishes. Finally I shelled out for one. It's inexpensive, sure, but I'd rather pay an extra dollar or two and have it be better constructed. Instead, a combination of very dark-dyed liquid inside and a cracked and warped answer piece means that half the time the answers are unreadable. The quality of construction could be far better."
2,"Couldn""t Read the Answers","It was like opening a long anticipated book, only to find most of the pages were illegible...I ordered the Magic Eight Ball for some last day of school fun. We got the eight ball out and asked a couple of big future life questions and lo and behold...the ""water"" inside the ball was too dark and inky to read most of the answers. I felt like we were trapped in some bad ""Final Destination"" movie with no future in front of us. Yikes!"
3,Magic 8-ball,"The new magic 8-ball has come a long way down from the original. The current version has a very dark window, so the 8-ball answers are barely legible. And the liquid inside appears to be more viscous, so the answers rise slowly, and 50% of the time, the answer polyhedron rests on an edge, so there is no answer at all.Compared to a friend's older 8-ball (30 years old), which is very fast to respond, and easy to read, this new 8-ball is clearly a few steps in the wrong direction."
1,Not like they used to make 'em,"Not a lot to say about a product like this, there is only one thing to say about it; the one thing it does, it does not do very well. Hmph.Back in the ole days when I was a kid:""Will I win the lottery this Saturday?""answer: ""Most likely not.""Now, with this new one:Answer: ...well I'm not quite sure; have to shake it a bit, coax it to rise to the surface of deep 1000-flushes-blue so I can actually read the answer because its stuck on one corner of the polyhedral die shaped oracle.This is frustrating to me. Imagine to my 7 year old daughter, wondering ""Will the fairies give me wings of my own?""Not made well."
4,Can't go wrong with the magic 8 ball,My granddaughter listed this toy on her amazon wish list. It has not changed since I had it as a child 50 years ago! Good old fashioned fun.
3,People have to pick it up.,"Bought this for a grab bag at work - and in the course of the game I ended up with it on my desk. Rarely do people come into my office without picking it up. They can't resist flipping it and looking for the ""answer"". Meetings have been disupted by someone deciding to ""let the Magic 8 Ball"" decide.The floating ""answer"" triangle often gets stuck in a hard to read position. Quality leaves something to be desired."
3,Magic 8 Ball,"This imported version of the old 8 Ball requires it to rest on a surface with the ""8 Ball"" label pointing straight upward, instead of foward and upward. It makes it less visually appealing."
1,Junk,"This 8 ball is junk. When the ""answers"" come up, there is ink or something on the triangles that make the answers unreadable. Skip this piece of junk"
3,8 Ball Remembered,The Magic 8 ball is the same as I remembered it in the 70's. The only thing different is that there is a line/ridge separating the two halves. I guess this was put there to make assembly easier. Overall It's fun to ask questions and see what responses you get. It also makes a great paper weight when I'm not consulting it.
1,Review of 8 Ball,"This is FUN....but I ordered 6 of them for myself and my fellow workers. The quality of the ""answers"" is nearly impossible to read. Big disappointment"
1,cant read the 8 ball,Could not read the 8 ball....not once. Neither tapping nor shaking the ball allowed it work.
4,Great marketing tool,"The Magic 8 Ball is a great tool for marketing decisions. For those days when intuition just doesn't cut it, try using an Magic 8 Ball. It is easier to use than a ouiji board, and doesn't require two people."
5,So Much Fun,"Hi, I am 11 years old. My friend has one of these, and he let me try it and i asked some questions on it and they were true! I would say that the magic 8 ball is 90% correct!"
4,Has anyone ever heard of a talking Magic 8 Ball?,"I gave 4 Magic 8 Balls as Christmas presents this year. The one I gave to my mother looks just like the others but when you shake it, it talks. A man's voice says several different things, always demanding to be let out. He also said we should unscrew the ball which we did and found a plastic brain with flashing lights on one side, the other side enclosed the answer cube and the liquid. We found it very spooky. I have written Mattel but have not yet gotten a response. It is impossible to get through by phone."
1,Can I give ZERO stars? I have NO idea how it received so many good reviews???,"I had this toy when I was a kid and had SO much fun with it, so I bought one for my son and it's NOT the same quality toy.It's nearly impossible to see the ball's answer because it's not clear and too small. Why do they make it so small when the area to view it is twice the size?Anyway, after we ALL agreed it was useless, I will return it.I have NO idea how it received so many good reviews???"
5,Never too old,I had one when I was younger and its still as much fun now as it was then. Makes making decisions a breeze.
5,A Classic! And works great!,"This magic 8 ball works great! I asked it if I should marry a girl and it said yes! My whole life is better!!! Just kidding...... but this is the classic fun 8 ball you remember from the 70s, or maybe it was the 60s. I bought it for my wife as a gag because she can never make a simple decision. Our family's had a lot of fun with it."
3,Classic,This is a classic but not made at all like the classic one was. Great for a grab bag gift for kids.
4,Fun,"It's a Magic 8 Ball. Great for making decisions and joking around with your friends in the office. I wish it had more answers and also a more solid mechanism so you didn't have to wiggle it around when it landed in between two answers.Aside from that, it's a great cheap office toy."
4,Magic 8ball fun,This is purely for fun. The responses to the questions are also uncannily true (whether really true only time can tell!) but it's a fun party toy nonetheless.
4,My 2 nephews love this toy!,"I have had a Magic 8 Ball for several years. And when my two nephews come to visit, they grab it off the shelf first thing and start asking it questions. It is so fun to them!"
2,Not all that great.,I bought this toy to use it as a quick decision maker on simple things and for fun. The little pyramid piece inside doesn't come with a single sign. You have to adjust it by shifting your hold on the ball to see the sign. Not worth for 8$ + tax.
1,Don't waste your money!,"I think the magic ""8"" ball is very boring. It is only a plastic ball with a little bit of fluid in it and a cube with writing on it that so small it that is impossible to read, and it has tiny window that is small, and easy to break. When ever you shake it the corner of the coube hits the window and bounces away. Does that sound fun! If I were you, I would save my money."
3,"Lots of fun, but the answer triangle doesn't always float up to the top","What a blast from the past this has been. My 5 year old saw it in a toystore, and I ordered it from Amazon for Christmas. He is enjoying it. It is fun, sort of educational (he tries to decode the message - he is learning to read), appears to be durable and is still intact after being dropped several times.The only negative is that quite often, the triangle or trapezoid or whatever the answer unit inside the ball is, it doesn't float up to the top to be easily readable. Instead, it sort of hovers on the edge, in between answers, but not showing clearly one side or another. Maybe it isn't sure of the answer! Maybe I should ask again!My son doesn't seem to mind, though.This is a great gift for someone - an executive to keep on their desk for a bit of levity when stressed over a difficult decision or for a party prize that can be used and enjoyed at the party."
1,Can't read the words on the triangle,"The liquid inside the ball is too murky, and the triangle doesn't settle up against the plastic clear glass; you can't read what it says. The one I had when I was a kid was much better than this one."
1,I wish it were more accurate,"This is a great toy. One complaint I have is that it only seems to be accurate about half the time. Thus, I have stopped using it to make major life decisions. Second, it is very hard to read the answers - I'm not sure if the liquid in it is too dark or there are too many bubbles or exactly what the problem is, but it is almost impossible to read the answers."
5,Magic 8 Ball never lies,"The magic 8 ball arrived as expected, Use it often in my office for decision making and it is usually right. sometimes hard to read."
5,love this book,I absolutely love this book. The photos are beautiful! I look at this book so much I guess it is my decorating bible right now haha. If you like Designers Guild fabrics you need to get this book.
1,Not a decorating book,"The title is all wrong for this book. It isn't a decorating book but an arty book about color, period. Don't look for gorgeous color-filled room in this book, because you won't find them. What you will see are big shots of closeups of flowers or fruit or other such things. Pretty but useless if you are into decorating."
1,extremely disappointing,The cover looked so good and fresh but the book inside does not show rooms. It's mostly close-up shots of flowers or other colorful items. If you are looking for a decorating book on color (a book that shows color used in ROOMS) DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. A WASTE OF [money].
1,don't buy it,"like another user, the car charger wiring came apart. the car charger did not fit into the zen vision without some extreme force (so much so I was worried i would damage my zen vision). when i tried to pull out the car charger, the wiring came apart. piece of junk... don't buy it.the travel charger works fine."
5,Great buy for a low price,"From the moment I plugged my Creative Zen Vision M 30 GB into the wall with the wall charger, I have been in love with the charger. If you are looking for reliable chargers for a low price, I recommend you get this item. Great!"
4,rapid,"great economical rapid car charger. can also play and listen at same time, but does have feedback in this mode. However, I suspect all of them have feedback when functioning in dual modes."
2,If you have time to wait...,"I ordered this item on Sep 18, got it 3 days later. The charger won't fit the Zen player. I returned it around Oct 3 after contacting BargainCell and received free postage for returning. I finally got a different charger that will work on Oct 27. I give BargainCell the credit for solving the problem, but the process took too long."
4,so worth it!!!,Delivers everything it promises. The charger is much quicker than the usb one. Don't hesitate to purchase.
1,So I guess I bought it just to look at ??,This charger sucks. I couldn't say how it works considering I can't even get it connected to my player. I have tried hooking it up every conceivable way and it just won't do it. So my opinion is thats it is a new art piece for my car that will float around forever.
5,Great - works like a charm!,This is great to have to charge your Zen Vision:M. It charges very fast and you can't beat it for the price.
1,"This book should be titled ""Romance for Rich Idiots""","The ideas in this book were either so juvenile or way too expensive, I'd have to get 3+ jobs to afford the gift ideas. NOT REALISTIC. A lot of repeats. Too bad I can't return it, otherwise I think I'll just throw it away."
5,Excellent System,"Great bargain here amazing crisp clear sound from the tweeters (surround speakers). The sub is even better. The sub may only have a 6.5"" woofer but let me tell you it's perfect whether you like rock, techno, rap or even country it will rock your house!!! Movies sound like your actually there, games are even better. Over all I rate this system a 10 for both value and quality. Especially considering the Logitech system that compares with this is 259.99! Overall a great buy here! The only con I have to admit is with the instructions which are ""slightly"" sketchy. However, if you have any intuition at all you will have no problem connecting this to your computer. Keep in mind that when you connect it to your computer, that your sound card is set to 6 ch audio otherwise you'll only have front output. In regard to hooking up your DVD or Xbox everything is labeled brilliantly, I do believe even a monkey could get that right. Heh."
2,Good Luck.,"System looks great. It probably sounds great too. Package comes with 5 speakers, 1 subwoofer, a large assortment of wires and cables, AND NO INSTRUCTIONS !!!! I studied medicine, not acoustic engineering. I called AMAZON, and they told me that I either had to send the system back, at a cost of about $80.00, or contact the manufacturer. None of the websites for ""Genius Home theater"" are active, so I can't reach them. If anyone out there knows how to hook one of these up, please let me know.Finally got this configured properly. Was actually pretty simple. Guess I'm just dense. Sounds fabulous, and that's really all that counts."
4,Value for your money,I have been searching for the docking station in other stores and this was by far the best value. I have been using it for a few weeks now and it has been very practical. I recomend it.
4,Docking station,Docking station was bought on someone else's behalf. The product arri3ed in good time and well packed. Product has not been tested yet.
3,"Product is fine, Sony support is awful","The docking station we received had a defective Ethernet port - it kept dropping out. We called Sony for support, and it took many phone calls to isolate the problem to a defective unit. Then it took nearly a dozen phone calls, hours on the phone, and more than four weeks for Sony to repair the unit and send it back to us. We kept being transferred between support people - nobody seemed to know how they supported docking stations. After we shipped it back for repair, nobody seemed to be able to find it or tell us the status. We were relieved when it arrived at our front door, with the problem fixed.We have liked Sony products in the past and the docking station was purchased for our brand-new top-of-the-line SZ VAIO notebook. After this experience with Sony support, we will think many times before we buy another Sony product."
2,Lacking some key things,"For this price I would expect more from a docking station. My biggest complaint is no audio jack. All my music is on my computer, and I can't stand the fact that I can't dock my notebook and automatically be connected to my stereo. Second, I don't like the fact that the notebook doesn't lock in. My HP at work is great because it locks in, so you know you have a solid connection, and releases with the push of a button. Lastly, for this price I would expect it to come with an AC adapter."
2,Sony Docking Station,This docking station has 3 USB ports (Not enough in my opinion) and does not come with a power cable. You must use the one that came with your computer which can be a pain if you take your laptop with you. After docked my SZ series computer wigs out almost everytime. You have to adjust the resolution to your external monitor and is quite annoying. Sometimes when docked it never shows up on the monitor at all. I then have to reboot. Not worth the price. If I had it to do allover again I would just hook the laptop directly to my monitor.
1,Very bad.,"I am not a gamer, and mostly I use this docking station for my SONY notebook for writing documents at home. That being said... External mouse and keyboard connections through USB are terrible. In addition to jumpy mouse responses, I sometimes lost the external keyboard connection. I am not saying not to buy it. If you are like me, you can get DVI connectivity and extra USB ports at $170. Go buy and experiment. BTW, did I mention that the DVI connection to my Dell 24'' widescreen slowed down the machine and sometimes even frozed it, using this docking station? Well... it did."
3,Same ports as the computer itself.,"When I purchased this docking station, I was hoping it would have a serial port, so I could connect my Palm to it and sycronize with my computer, and a parallel port, so I could connect my pin printer to it, but it had none of them, so it was a real dissapointment. Not much use to me."
2,Interesting premise...,"Shades of Orwell's 1984 in this futuristic love story of a young girl falling in love with a boy from the wrong side of the tracks. Amanda Peterson takes her shirt off. Her back is to the camera, but it's pleasant to watch. Rest of the movie had the potential to go somewhere, but was hampered by very obvious limitations of a small budget."
3,Old school,"This book has a lot of information, and I learned a lot from it. It has a lot of useful information and a lot of useless information"
5,no book like this,There is no other book like this. Or I should say the complete book about compositing. All you need to know and more.I think for compositing work you only need to read two books this one and one from Ron Brinkmann. No need for anything else.
4,"Yes, these are great Catholic songs","I grew up with the music of the St. Louis Jesuits and this CD is a good representation of the BEST. In the spirit of Be Not Afraid, I am Near You, on Eagles Wings are all songs I loved in high school, college, and adult life. We sing most of these songs regularly at Mass. These are pleasant renditions of inspirational songs that uplift - in my opinion they are far better than much of the dirge music pre-vatican II."
2,Disappointing,"This CD was not at all what I expected. It sounds just like you are in Church. Every song is accompanied by an organ and most of them sung in soprano. The tempo of all the songs is very slow too! I was looking for something I could sing along to, not put me to sleep! On the positive side, there are some beautiful songs, I just wish they were sung more ""up beat""."
5,Great CD,"I don't know who said these weren't Catholic, but they haven't been to Mass in a long time. These are all the favorites that I sing and have sung in church for over 20 years. Volume 1 is even better. Some of the greatest songs for mass."
2,Why bother?!,"Do not be fooled by the words ""price guide"". The books fails profusely in that department. It can be used as a list of role-playing games, but there are plenty of those, most of them are better than this. Try to avoid this books if possible. I see no reason to buy it."
2,"Lactose-free, and perhaps delicious, but not dairy-free","I was disappointed in the recipes in this cookbook. Perhaps they taste wonderful, but if I am just going to go to the store and buy lactose-free milk to replace the milk I used to use (which was free since it came from our own animals) do I really need a cookbook to tell me how to use it? I would think I can simply substitute lactose-free milk in the recipes I use now. That was not my goal in buying a lactose-free cookbook. I was hoping to find something that would show me how to get along without milk. I'm sure it fills a need for some, but not for those of us who are unwilling to go out and buy a substitute product."
5,"A ""must-buy"" if you have a lactose restricted diet!","This recipe book provides a great deal of helpful information on alternative lactose free products and what to look for on the label to find lactose, as it may be hidden in some other ingredients. The recipes are delicious and simple. There is a wide variety of unique recipes to try. My husband and I are having the best time with the wonderful ice cream recipes! This recipe book is a must if you are lactose intollerant or have a lactose restricted diet. The book is well worth the low cost!"
5,New Edition Available,The 2005 Edition was released in October 2004. This book is essential for all student pilots and flight instructors.
1,Wrong type of product,I returned the product. I thought it was a DVD of stepping and not a book. I want tapes.
1,Graps Underground Should be Left There,"I was so excited by the title and ""Craps Underground"". Images of a secret brotherhood or society of professional dice setters practicing a skill only imagined to be real. What a complete boring farce! What kind of ""underground"" is it that does cable A&E specials for the world to see. Sickening repetitive anadotes on his wife, coupled with his shamless self-promotion, filled the pages with as much taste as bland, cold mashed potatoes without gravy. I completely agree with a previous review, 10 pages would be way more than enough to contain the few meager grains of mildy interesting reading. Its sad to think my purchase of this book added a penny of profit to such a bloated ego and boring smuck. Do yourself a favor, leave this book in a landfill with the other garbage."
5,Enjoyed this a lot,"This is a book that takes you into a world very few people get to see. An exciting world where the odds of the casinos are turned into the players' favor because of the players' skill at controlling the dice. Although this is not a how-to book, it is a book about the greatest gamblers using skill to defeat the casinos.Scoblete has made the book fun and interesting. He has great characters that he is writing about and the story breezes along at a rapid clip. The book is one of those that is hard to put down because you always want to know what is coming up next.The book ends with a smashingly great three week Vegas trip where Scoblete goes throught the good and th ebad of an extended playing trip. The book is definitely worth getting."
2,Book is an INFOMERCIAL for Scoblete's crap school,"This book is pretty expensive for what should be really be a series of advertisements, magazine articles and ""trip reports"". I haven't read much by Scoblete before, but if this is any indication it's not good. There are a few redeeming passages about characters in the crap world but other than that I wouldn't pay more than $5 for it if I hadn't read it already.First, his editor should be fired for allowing through the 12th grade composition level writing.Second, every second sentence is about Scoblete and how he eventually got involved in a craps shooting school.Third, he admits this was the second of three books his publisher required him to write under contract. This explains a lot. Like how it seems to be a mish mash of random notes taken on gambling trips rolled into a ""book"" to be sold to YOU. If you are at the poker table and you can't tell who the sucker is - it's you."
5,This is the REAL THRILL ride!,"Very few people can beat the casinos, that's what makes those who can such an interesting breed. Frank Scoblete, casino gambling greatest writer, has written the ultimate book on the great craps shooters in the world today. These people have won millions from the casinos by developing their ability to control the dice.The book is laoded with great stories and incidents. Scoblete recounts his almost twenty years at the tables with the world's greatest players.The book is fun to read even if you have no interest in playing the game of craps."
5,Awesome Book!,I haven't read a book that was this great in years. I was rivetted by the writer's style and his stories are just eye-opping. This book reads like a great novel and I was just awed by the fact that these people are actually in the casinos and playing. A must read for anyone who wishes they could win millions from the casinos!
5,Superior Writing About Great Adventures,"If this were a novel, it would be a best seller instantly because it takes you into a world that most people never see - the world of high stakes, professional craps players who have attained the ability to alter the probabilities of the dice when they roll. The individuals are an amazing mix of types and ages, both men and women, many of them having won significant money over the years.Scoblete is a writer who has power in his words. He takes us on a fun-filled journey with behind the scenes action. His characters are sharply defined and come alive as you read the book. This is an A+ effort by a great writer."
2,little boring,i'm spoiled watching good History Channel footage. If you want raw footage with little cohesiveness to glue the footage together for you then this is for you.
2,No.,"Dissapointing, especially since I thought you couldn't go wrong with Robbins writing about Hollywood. I really didn't like any of the characters, except for a couple of the women. Most of the females were evil sluts and the men were pigs who treated the women like dirt. Also, I was hoping it would have more Hollywood dish. I thought there was supposed to be a part of the book based on the real life murder of Johnny Stompanato (Lana Turner's lover) by her duaghter Cheryl. Guess I had it confused with another book. Also, there is a character, a young dancer named Margit that I have a horrible feeling is supposed to be based on Ann-Margret. If so, Robbins should be ashamed of himself. If you're going to read a Robbins novel, don't start with this one or it will probably be the last one you read...that is if you are able to force yourself to finish it."
2,A typical Robbins novel. Short on substance.,"This novel is a sequel to The Carpetbaggers. It is very predicable with the usual sex. Jonas Cord Jr. is a younger version of his father or should I say Howard Hughes. Harold Robbins career peaked when he penned, A Stone For Danny Fisher."
5,Soap on a Rope,I thought it was great to be able to buy this soap on a rope and have it sent to my house in speedy time. I have not been able to find in my area.
3,Good for 3 yr olds,"The package was much smaller than expected (though I didn't really read the product dimensions) as were the dinos inside. Still, my dinosaur crazy 3 yr old nephew liked it, so that's really all that matters."
5,Made for the Water,I took my Garmin 76 GPS river rafting (in my Foarm case)The textured case made the GPS easy to grip when wet.It also dried quickly (the foam and rubber are impervious to water).I highly recommend this case to anyone using their Garmin GPS for water sports!
4,Three Stephen King Miniseries In One Set,"This set includes three of Stephen King's TV miniseries, those being The Stand, The Langoliers, and The Golden Years. Personally, I found the Langoliers and The Golden Years to be decent, and immensely enjoyed The Stand. For those wondering, there are no special features to speak of. The set includes only the movies themselves. As an added bit of information, to the best of my knowledge, this is currently the only way to own any of these three titles as all three are currently out of print."
4,Golden Yawns,"I loved THE STAND. It's one of my all time favorite movies anyway. I had recently read the book THE LANGOLIERS. Of course, while no movie can be as descriptive as one of King's books, I thought the movie was enjoyable. My daughter liked the Golden Years, but it was a bit too slow for me. I was yawning within the first 10 minutes of the movie and found it difficult to attend to it. But, the service by Amazon was good. The movie set came a few days earlier than expected. Overall, we were pleased with the purchase."
4,Cheesy goodness,"I don't know why, but i had been wanting to see The Stand again. I loved it when I was a kid and I thought I'd make a day of it--that didn't happen. I got this DVD set because people were greedy and the single movie DVD set was way too much for it, this was close to their price new and had three movies. Damn, a better deal because I get the joy of having not one cheesy Stephen King adapted TV movies but two (I had never seen the Golden Years and still have yet to see it).These are probably not the best movies base on books by King, but they are good for laughs. Most of these people have entered the ""where are they now?"" bin of our minds, but the movies are worth the price."
1,Not worth it!,"This collection sucks!!!! The only good movie here is ""Stand"". The other movies seems like someone said ""hey, let just do some random things in front of the camera"". Whoever put this package together has found a great way to rid them selves of these garbage movies and get paid!!!"
3,King is tough to put on film.,"The Langoliers is very lame. The Stand with more time to develop a story, is much better."
5,A must for all Stephen King Fan's,"I was so happy to finally find these made for TV shows on DVD. I have (had) each of these on VHS and they were starting to get worn out. By far the best is ""The Stand"", but each of them showcase the masterful story-telling of Stephen King."
3,dissappointed,"I bought this because ""The Stand"", which is my favorite Stephen King mini-series ,is no longer available by it self and my old vhs recorded copy was worn out. I was disappointed that there are no special features on it. I have read that King had some very interesting comments on the original dvd.The ""Langoliers"" is also good.I also enjoyed the ""Golden Years"" when it originally aired on tv. Buyers should know that this version has a different ending (probably better) and the original ending can be seen on Youtube.( the original opening too). I also remember more story content than is on this dvd. Things I remembered happening were not there so I checked the internet and read the shows had been ""trimmed"".If you like the ""Langoliers"" and ""The Stand"" and don't care about special features, it is worth buying."
5,Finally!,"I had the original version of The Stand on DVD and when my air force son went to Afghanistan I sent it to him to pass the time. He left it there for others to enjoy. Was bummed when the manufacturer discontinued it, and am thrilled to see it with this set!!"
4,Stephen Kings gift set the stand golden years and langoliers,"The Langoliers just happened to be in the set, no value to me, but the Stand and Golden Years were some of the best I've seen and for the price the value of this package is very good."
4,Yeah!,Just getting The Stand made it worthwhile to me. Now I don't have to put up with commercials. Nor do I have to wait for the USA network to show it. Hurrah!
5,whomever,i choose this rating cuz Stephen King is the best story book writer and movie maker of all times.There will never be no one like him in my life time.
2,The price,Saw this at the storw for 40 dollars and went to buy it then decided look here. BUT WOW the cost... The golden years wasn't even that good the only reason i wanted it was for the langoliers but the proce just for that one...wow!
3,"A Good One, Some Background, and a B sci-fi","Bought this DVD because it had The Stand (a favorite) and about 13 hours of video (about $2 an hour the first run through). In addition to The Stand, I got The Langoliers and Golden Years. I have seen The Langoliers. It is the kind of movie I use as background while I work at the computer, read, or do any of those things I don't want distractions while I do them. It does its job. Golden Years was a little surprise. It reminds me of a 50's science fiction movie, including synthesized music at the right places near the beginning. Fun in a 50's B sci-fi movie kind of way, And, it will become another background mask after watching the first time."
4,Stephen King's Gift Set,Have always loved Stephen King and the movies The Stand and Langoliers and was glad to get them in a set.
5,Another Great Collection,"This is an essential Stephen King collection...a lot of his earlier works..well worth the price if you enjoy Stephen King. ""The Stand"" alone is worth the purchase price...if you are a fan this is a must for your collection!@"
5,One of my favorites,"I really loved the Stand and the Langoliers, had never seen the Golden Years, but this is now one of my favorite DVD's."
2,DON'T BOTHER - I finally threw this book away!,"I have made several muffin recipes from this cookbook. I have been very disappointed in the fact that the authors never really employed a recipe editor to find typos and most of all inconsistencies! There are numerous inconsistencies!!!... For example: when it comes to the amount of butter - they switch back and forth from ounces to tablespoons, etc. Also, they never explain what they mean by way of the size of muffin tins. I was confused many a time in deciding what muffin tin size they really meant. One of the recipes (that I know of) omitted a sentence from the directions, and one had the order switched! Good Grief...those people who have not attempted to make anything from this book have no right saying it is a good cookbook! I am an accomplished cook - and I had problems with it...don't bother with this book. PS...the muffin recipes are nothing special. I have other cookbooks that are much better for muffin recipes!"
2,Not great,"There is absolutely nothing here that you will not find in countless other baking books. There are surprisingly few recipes- and nothing out of the ordinary. You will find basic recipes for chocolate chip cookies, waffles, apple pie. You can find those in any Betty Crocker anthology.There are few illustration in the disapointing little book. The few that htere are show elaborately decorated cakes- which a re beutiful, but it lacks clear instructions of hpw to craft such creations. I think there are such books on the market which will be a better bet than this one."
3,Great cafe not giving away all its secrets,"I was very excited when I heard the Cupcake Cafe was publishing a book. I have been to the cafe many times, and they make delicious, beautifully decorated cakes and cupcakes. Many of my friends rely on them for all their birthday cakes, etc. As an amateur baker, I've been eager to get their recipes -- especially for the excellent buttercream -- and their secrets for making such beautiful flower decorations. As of yet, I have not tried the recipes, but I am definitely disappointed in the lack of photographs and diagrams. Half of the book is devoted to creating buttercream flowers, but uses only text to describe the process. There are a few pages of color inserts of completed cakes. These are definitely inspiring, but also frustrating, because I still have no idea how to make them!!"
1,What a disappointment!,"Sorry, I didn't like this book at all. Very few pictures and the recipes are nothing special. Many typos/ mixed instructions. I threw it away."
2,Disappointed in Cupcake Cafe Cookbook,"I had high hopes for this book, and was disappointed when I tested several of the recipes. Because many people prefer a buttercream that is less sweet than the standard 10X sugar and butter blend, I thought this might be the answer. Not only was the taste odd--totally butter, no ""cream"" or vanilla or even sweet taste--but the icing was unmanageable from a designer's point of view. Very unstable. I suspect something has been omitted or misprinted.The Chocolate Cake recipe that is supposed to yield 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 dozen cupcakes in fact yielded 4 dozen decent sized cupcakes. An abundance of riches, perhaps, but frankly they were quite blah. . .I also find the writing to be somewhat affected.Photos are gorgeous and inspiring, but there aren't enough of them."
4,Disfunctional Fun,In Season 3 we finally get the wrap up of the hilarious antics that began in Season 1. It all makes sense as the episodes come to an end. In the very last episode you get a shocking twist and it makes a great conclusion.Loved every minute of Jason Bateman's disfuctional family.
3,Arrested Development Season 3,"The used copy of Arrested Development was in great quality. The only criticism I have is that the DVD season had all the discs, yet didn't have a box cover. Though altogether I was happy with my purchase."
5,Best show ever on tv,The only bad thing about Arrested Development is that it's over. It is the best show ever. People who don't get that don't get it for one reason. They haven't watched from the first episode. It's a smart show that you need to see from the beginning.Best show ever!!
5,Best TV show ever,"This was the quickest, most layered and witty show ever aired on television. Way ahead of its time, without the apprecaiton that it deserved."
5,Hilarious,This show is amazing. I have watched the seasons front to back several times and they still make me laugh every time
4,The Best Came Late....,"Season Three of my favorite satirical television comedy had its ups and downs. It started strong, fell into a celebrity-guest-star rut and then pulled out into a spectacular ending.In the first few episodes, it picked up right where Season Two left off - with the biting wit and startlingly clever jokes. But it soon fell into the trap of trying to hold on to its time slot with a celebrity appearance. Charlize Theron is hot and hysterical, but when the storyline starts to revolve around her and Michael, the rest of the characters are neglected and the jokes become stale.As the producers realized their inevitable fate of cancelation, they began to prepare. In the final four episodes, they essentially let loose every joke they'd been writing and saving for subsequent seasons. The result is a quadruplet of hysterics. The jokes come faster than fireworks during the Fourth of July finale. This season will be well worth your money despite the slight ups and downs."
5,Ban Fox Now!,"I not only banned the Fox network after cancelling the only sliver of good (no, great) and inventive writing and acting on television but I rarely puruse the other channels. Not having cable I rely on DVD's for my small taste of pop culture. The fact that Game Shows and Celebrities (whatever a celebrity is) cooking food or 'Mediums' or 'Crossing Jordans' or other meager insults have dominated the networks says plenty about our expectations. I may be an elitist but I'm not some extremist. I simply have common sense and common sense often suggests I turn off the television. Try it for a week. I promise when you return, after the first six car commercials have finished and the program, whatever it is, begins you will feel insulted.I cannot forgive Fox for cancelling the only promise of a literate, well-acted program in years. I would commend the acting on the only great shows now on the air but they're all cartoons(didn't the sophomores at Fox cancel 'Family Guy' once?)I'll say no more."
5,Fantastic!,"One of the funniest shows to ever be on t.v.! It was cancelled way too early, but at least it left on a high point. This last season is as funny as the first two, and you won't be disappointed!"
5,Best TV show ever,"Honestly, just buy all three seasons. It's the most clever, well-constructed, and executed TV show I've ever watched. The characters have such depth and diversity - once you start watching it, you won't be able to stop. Be sure to watch the first ~6 episodes first, as they introduce and focus on each character."
5,THE Television Show to Own.,"Arrested Development is one of the smartest and funniest shows ever made. The characters are so idiosyncratic and greedy yet so lovable and situations are just so absurd, it's incredibly hilarious. And the comedy is so well written: there's things with double meanings, so much irony, references to previous episodes and other shows, running jokes, and even foreshadowing! Where else can you find foreshadowing, for crying out loud? This show will make you laugh so hard you'll cry. If any show deserves to be bought on DVD, this is the one. Let's make it number one! Buy it now!"
5,Watch for the Cameo,Awesome series finale. Watch for the uncredited appearance of Jennifer Friedland in the Queen Mary scenes!
5,Why does the best stuff on TV get cancelled?,"Ah, well...Great writing, paired with very funny actors.AND - the series had an ending!"
2,This review is for season 3 only,"I don't think I laughed out loud once throughout the season 3 dvd. The reviewer who mentions that season 3 is the worst of the 3 is right. 2 stars at best. And yes... as you guessed it, there were a bunch of new writers put in. This is what happens when a show all of a sudden changes it's feel- the writers were changed and it was obvious.Don't let this deter you from getting seasons one and two however! They're both hilarious and I couldn't believe that the show was cancelled...until I saw the 3rd season that is where things got too ridiculous even for this show. The first 2 seasons had brilliant writing and performances. Season 2 is my personal favorite. My roommates and I have never laughed so hard. Not to mention the fact that Bateman is a cutie! With the 3rd season's writers there's no way the show stood a chance at staying on the air and with the old talent gone maybe it was just meant to be a short lived show. Thank god for dvd."
5,AD,"The third season picks up where the second let off and doesn't stop in terms of writing, humor, or sheer zaniness until the final episode (a classic with references galore to the pilot episode). Some of the storylines take more time to get into than in previous seasons, but throughout the quality of the production is top-notch and the casting is as perfect as ever--special mention should go to the characters Tobias, GOB, Lucille, and George Michael--and as for quotability...oh, my. Strongly recommended and sorely missed on air."
1,Arresting Developments,The first 2 seasons were better but on the whole this series was hilariousand one of the smartest comedies on the TV.
1,I'm so ashamed of season 3.,"Don't you hate it when you brag to all your friends about how something is so cool and when you finally show it to them it falls flat and you look like a fool. That's how I feel about season 3 of Arrested Development. I cringe at how bad it is. I hope it gets canceled if it's going to be this bad from now on. I don't know what happened. It could be that there were different writers, the lack of Henry Winkler, the under use of Jeffery Tambor, the hieghtened absurdity of the David Cross gay jokes, the horrible retard plot or maybe it was never good to begin with and we all just built it up so much we let ourselves down. It's not the latter. I recently saw season 1 again and it's amazing. Season 3 is just bad, bad, bad. Matrix sequels bad."
5,Perfect,"It just doesn't get any better than this. If you need a break from your worries, if you could use a laugh, this is IT."
5,Well well well,"Well well well, so this is what television is suppose to be like,well written, well acted, well edited."
5,ridiculously funny,"If you've never seen this show, make it a point to watch the first two seasons in order before watching this third and final season. The final thirteen episodes of Arrested Development explore new territories and introduce new problems for these characters. Since several other reviewers already break down what happens in these episodes I'll save my breath. I'll just say this: mistaken identity is a key theme to every episode in the third season. While the finale ties up most of the loose ends, it also introduces some new plot threads that could easily fit into the rumored Arrested Development film project. Consider Arrested Development a 53 part mini-series--these are the final thirteen episodes...and they are hilarious.Extras for this set include:Commentaries on ""Forget Me Now,"" ""Mr. F,"" and ""Development Arrested""19 Deleted and Extended Scenes""Last Day on the Set"" Featurette"
5,Fox made a Huge Mistake,"Not going to bother rehashing what has been said in all these other reviews -- essentially, the greatest sitcom in the history of the medium, cut down in it's prime. Yet another sin the suits at Fox will have to answer for on their arrival in Hell...The Ocean Walker has the best ending gag in the history of television...I literally fell out of my chair laughing when it first aired.If you like comedy that requires intelligence instead of insulting yours, buy all three seasons right now!"
5,The 21st century's greatest comedy so far,"The third season of this hysterical show lives up to expectations. The show continues to blend dysfunctional family comedy with jabs at current events. (The fact that we're a few years' removed from their current events only makes it more interesting.) Season 3 is packed with guest stars, some of whom are funny (Scott Baio as Bob Loblaw - say that name out loud) and some of whom I found a little creepy (Charlize Theron as Michael's mentally-disabled love interest). Buying the DVD set is worth it, because although episodes can be found online, you're going to want to watch this show over and over, and there's no guarantee it will always be available. The special features are also cute - commentaries are by the entire cast, which makes them a lot of fun to listen to."
4,Got This for Nostalgia's Sake,"I watched the show while it was on and have the first two seasons on DVD, so I got this for nostalgia's sake. It keeps its humor for the first few episodes, but then gets very snarky and overdone. This is when they got completely desperate because they were about to get cancelled. It is worth having if you have the first two seasons but if you aren't that big a fan I wouldn't recommend it."
5,MIDI Solutions Quadar,Awesome little piece of equipment. It permits me to use and/or select from multiple midi devices. Very fast shipping. The product works exactly as described on the web site. GREAT!
1,I am a Latin Instructor and this is a disgrace!!!!,"I am a latin instructor and was going to recommend this guide to my students, but I was so disgraced at this guides numerous references to ""see Wheelock"" as well as thoughts that are supposed to help students, make them more confused! I don't recommend this book to any student or person at all."
4,Pretty good,I think the wipes are a little small to clean an entire may but otherwise they seem to do what they are supposed to. -1 star for size. Pleasant smelling but not at all lingering or overpowering. I suggest using this right before your practice as the aromatherapy dissapates pretty fast.
4,Great product for the yoga mat,"These wipes smell incredible. I love all the scents and the aromatherapy does wonders for my practice if I use it before I begin a yoga class. They keep my mat very clean and smelling fresh. I gave these wipes 4 stars only because the wipes tend to roll up while I'm applying them to the mat since they are very thin. If they were thicker, I don't think I would have the rolling problem. But, it does get annoying. Otherwise, I highly recommend them!"
5,Addition to my earlier review.,"I previously mentioned the Discovery of Stereo Tapes. I was misinformed, and this release is in the Original Mono. Great sound and performances nevertheless. Apologies for unintentionally misleading anyone."
3,Slightly Disappointed.,"First of all there are too many Harleys in this video, thought there would be a lot more Brit Iron. Secondly, I thought it would focus on the technical aspect of building this bike... it really didn't in my opinion.It was very entertaining, had a decent sound track and humor."
3,Not worth it.,It was ok... The guy dressing up in a cape & crap seemed like some punk from one of my son's skateboard videos... Corny... but ok.
3,Product Description Misleading,"The product description is for the Gale Encyclopedia as a whole, not this article. The article itself is maybe a page and a half long and is indeed about Fugue states, but there are no charts or tables. It doesn't include any more information than that which can be found on the internet for free."
3,Super Reader,"Oswald Bastable is an English army officer, sent on a mission to the mountains in the Nepal region. It does not go too well, and sick and delirious he stumbles into a citadel that is rumoured to have existed for all time.When he wakes up, he is several decades in the future and the natives are not disposed to be too friendly."
3,Somewhat interesting,"The alternate history that Moorcock proposes--one in which the colonial powers maintained and expanded their empires, scientific progress was retarded and great warships dominated the skies--is interesting, but the story he places therein is not very exciting and culminates in a predictable climax. In addition, the first third of the book, which explains how adventurer Oswald Bastable traveled to the future, is really an enormous non-sequitur. There is really no reason for the protagonist of this story to be a visitor from the past and, other than establishing that fact, nothing that happens at the beginning has any bearing at all on what happens in the rest of the story."
3,A slow paced alternate history novel,"This is the first novel about Oswald Bastable and his travels through time. The novel starts with M.Moorcock telling the reader about his friend Bastable who claims to have gone through time. Oswald dictates that he found himself in a different Earth where wars were fought with air baloons. Oswald is a pilot of one of the baloons and is captured by an Asian warlord who plans to wage war against the world.I found the novel to have an interesting storyline, but it was too slow paced and sometimes a bit too hard to read on."
3,reggae is my heartbeat-but this needs resuscitation,"I love reggae music with all of my heart, but unfortunately this piece does not do ""it"" for me. It has plenty of room for improvement. Maybe if lucky dube, mad lion, or chaka demas and the pliers re-made it, it would have the bump and flavor of real reggae music"
1,Con Air Infiniti Model HC701,"The Hair clipper worked great the first time I used it to cut my own hair, but the next time I went to use it it went crazy. I was cutting my son's hair and the digital display went blank, and it started to run wide open and would not turn off. It will not work at all now. I had to send my son to school with half a hair cut.....don't laugh it's not funny!"
1,Doesn't work,"I'd love to write a review of this product, but I can't because the one I got doesn't work - AT ALL ! The unit will not turn on. Even spoke to ConAir and they said return it. So I guess it's back to the barber for me. After having to wait weeks to receive the thing, I'll have to wait weeks again to try and get one that works. I am very unhappy !!!!"
1,This biggest piece of junk I have ever owned,"I have already returned this thing twice!! Both previous units got really hot when charged for the first time, the screen quit working, and eventually the entire clipper just quit. DO NOT BUY!!"
1,Buyer beware,"I bought this trimmer several months ago and at first it worked okay. Very soon thereafter it began to have trouble holding a charge, and I eventually could only use it while still being plugged into the charger. Now it doesn't work at all and is frozen in the ""on"" setting, yet not doing anything. I only hope that the warranty hasn't expired. Overall, I've used a couple of different trimmers but none have caused me as much grief as this one."
1,Good Idea - Doesn't Work,"I share the frustrations of other reviewers. I purchased a set six months ago, and I've been through three sets already (the original set, and two replacement sets for which I had to pay shipping). All three sets sufferred agonizing deaths as their motors mysteriously wined for no apparent reason and ultimately died.Funny thing -- I bought the original set because another pair of Conair clippers (different model) began to give me problems.No more Conair products for me. I'm done."

1,"Not a ""Beginning"" Type of Book","I bought this book to check out some of the new features of VB 2005 & SQL Server 2005. I had already had some knowledge of SQL & VB, so when I encountered the first bad reference on page 22 I already knew how to fix it.By page 66 I was tired of fixing numerous errors and bad code samples.I truly believe that a book advertised as a BEGINNING issue should be just that. This is not for a beginner, it would discourage someone starting out very quickly. I would suggest look elsewhere on starting out with VB & SQL 2005.I suggest to the Author & Editors, that they should take the time to see if the books info really works in real life, in stead of rushing it to market."
1,Why do amazon allow authors reviews to be included against books,Surely Authors should not be allowed to give inevitable five star reviews to their own books.
2,Old and Stale,Perfume was old and smelled awful. If its not being made anymore or whatever that should have been posted in the info. Wanted it for my mother and we both are so very disappointed. Just awful. Mislead on purchase that too is disappointing. Truth is so much better. If seller had been honest that it was old prob would have bought it anyway just so she could smell it for memory sake . But Oh well live and learn.
1,DKNY Queen Fitted Sheet,Where's the tread count? I would never pay $69.99 for sheets with out this knowledge.
1,Leaks!,"I got this as an alternative to the swiffer, because the pads are washable. However, it leaks! Despite the claim that the solution can be stored in the tank, i've had to clean up my laundry room from it leaking twice. Also, if the bottom section is tilted the wrong way while you empty the vaccum, the mop solution leaks.I have read and reread the instruction manual, and there is no troubleshooting tips for this. Don't waste your money. Buy a swiffer, a Hoover floormate, or stick to your mop."
1,useless after 3 months,"I bought the Flip-Ease off of Amazon.com a little over 3 months ago. I was very happy with the product during the 1st month of use, when I use it once a week.I was happy with its cleaver design of combining a mop and a vacuum. I was happy with how much dust it collected. I was happy with how easy it was to use. I was happy of how little space it took up in my apartment.However after the 1st month the product began to have problems. The first thing that stopped working was the sprayer for the wet side and now the vacuumed will not hold a charge more then 5 minutes no matter how long I charge it. The product has become useless after only 3 months of use. I am very disappointed in Bissell. I thought up until now that they made only quality products."
2,"Not all that great, but has a couple of nice features ....","I bought this while in search of a replacement for my badly missed Bissell steam mop (which is no longer made). While the cordless feature IS great, it does a rather poor job of mopping a floor, the actual ""mop"" part is only a small velcroed microfiber cloth over a hard plastic head, which doesn't absorb any major dirt or mess. Stick vac part is ok, one bright spot was it came with a small bottle of Bissell floor cleaner (which, as it turns out IS a good product). But, I was not very impressed with this as a useful cleaning device, so back to the store it goes!"
1,Not as great as I had hoped...,"I too chose this over the Swiffer and wish I hadn't. The vacuum seems to push stuff around more than anything else. And the battery doesn't last very long at all, which makes big clean up jobs very time consuming. It tends to leak water a lot too - even when I'm not using the mop side. Yet the squirting action tends not to work so well - the holes get clogged very easily and I have to use a pin to clear them out all the time. The mopping part works ok, but I could have bought a cheaper mop."
1,Don't waste your $,I should have listened to the other reviewers. The water/solution tank leaks A LOT of fluid. I wasn't able to mop my floor because so much water came out of the tank @ one time -- And not from where it's supposed to come out! I am sending it back ASAP!
2,Don't like the product,"There a missing part so I return it. Water leaking out from the bottom. Got a little disapointed then what I expected.They send me another one when I asked for refund. Anyway I used it, it is not good like they said. The vaccum very weak, it barely can pick up dirt. I have to used strenth to mop and dirt will not stick to the fabric. Didn't like the product at all.Edit your post:To insert a product link use the format: [[ASIN:ASIN product-title]] (What's this?)They send me another one when I asked for refund. Anyway I used it, it is not good like they said. The vaccum very weak, it barely can pick up dirt. I have to used strenth to mop and dirt will not stick to the fabric. Didn't like the product at all. Guidelines"
5,THE BEST INVENTION IN THE WORLD!!!!,"I cannot say enough good things about this little contraption. I have 3 other variations of sweepers, moppers, and this one takes the cake! I am contemplating buying another because I'll be sooooo sad when this one kicks the bucket!!! Awesome and easy to use, holds a long charge(weeks) and so easy to refill!!!! YEAH TO BISSELL!!!"
1,Back to the store it goes!!!,"The previous owner of my home said they were the best?? HA!!! The vac worked some...but only on tiny particles, bigger stuff just pushes around, and the mop?? A bigger mess than I had in the first place!! AND my house smells like a big wet dog!! UGHHH!! Very disapointed. I'm gonna go back to my old trick of old using terry cloth rags on the swiffer wet jet in place of my mop (saves on costly pad replacement AND works better anyhow) and a seperate vac. I was trying to get the two in one conveinence NEVERMIND!!! AVOID!!! DON'T WASTE YOUR DOUGH ON THIS ONE!!!"
5,This product is great!!,"I just got this Bissell today and my first impression is amazing!!! I have been struggling trying to keep my military tile floor clean and I thought it was hopeless. I got tired of having to sweep it every day too. I used this Bissell and it vacuum great! And I tried the mop part out, and I'm amazed that my floor is whiter than it ever has been!!! I have tried several different mops and cleaners and this is hands down the best!! Finally, a clean floor!! Now my low crawling 8 month old doesn't have to clean it anymore!!"
1,NOT SO GOOD OVER TIME,"UPDATED NOV 22 2009DOWN TO ONLY 1 STAR - PIECE OF JUNK .... BUT THE BATTERY LIFE SEEMS FINE. It just has so little suction and the wet pad idea is just a dirty mess maker. I use it for light (I mean really light) dust-busting, but it is not shaped or designed for just that, so I can't even use it as an effective dust-buster except for a few spots around the house.DO NOT RECOMMEND.I was pleased with the quick light cleaning at first. However over time, it really turned out to be much less useful than I first thought.The suction is terrible and the cleaning pads are a mess. Taking off the dirty ones, washing and replacing makes the whole thing problematic.The pads are attached with velcro and stretch and wear poorly when washed. Thus they do not fit that well once used and washed several times, and the velcro has it's own typical loss of adhesion after constant use.THUMBS DOWN in the long run."
3,Dry vac side is good - wet mop side is not,"The mop leaked all over the place. I went to Bissell's web site for help and was able to find some instructions about making sure that tubes were secure, etc. I was glad to find help, but I wish the mop wouldn't leak. Also, after you dry vac, you need to change the pad otherwise you are spreading dirt from the dry vac pad all over your floor. I wouldn;t recommend this product if you are looking for a mop. But if you just need a floor vac, this works well. It holds a charge for 10 or 15 minutes which allows me to vacuum the floors several times per week. ANd it has good suction."
3,Works Okay,This item is okay if you're racing on the street but off road racing can cause the bar to dislodge. My sons and I are constantly reattaching the bar.
4,"Works well, but...","As most people complain about the traxxas wheelie bar, this one comes unclipped quite often, but otherwise it works well and keeps my sons rustler from flipping over most of the time."
3,Agree on plastic and coming undone point of views...,"I am in agreement with the reviews before me....this will wear out sooner than expected, but it does come unclipped more than I imagined it would. However, the shipment from Amazon was very quick, the installation is indeed very easy and the price is fair. For those of you that have 7-10 year olds at the controls, this little addition more than serves its purpose and delivers the appropriate amount of laughter and excitement."
3,Hard hits knock it off,"For a stock wheelie bar, it does its job. But after you pop a few of them the bars on the left and right will pop off. This is not a huge problem but they start to crack everything around the bar itself. A wheelie bar is almost manditory on the trucks and this one works. But there is an aluminum motor gaurd that you can buy to ""keep"" it from popping off. I have not upgraded to that yet. so I have no review on it. This does come with the longer mounting screws.If your truck comes with a motor gaurd do NOT buy this. buy the wheelie bar assemby with out the motor gaurd to save you some money. But if you have nothing, this is the cheapest route."
2,Comes unclipped,Clips that hold on to the bar come undone and completely defeat the purpose of having the wheelie bar. Not worth buying in my option. I'll be throwing mine away. Total waste of money.
4,if you want to know what it meant to live in a communist Poland,"read this book, thru the eyes of a litterature and poetry real geek you will find out the life that you never imagined. The ""love story"" is a pretext to tell so many things... enjoy!"
5,Conway the Heartbreaker,"A longtime fan of Conway; seen him in concert only one time. His music has been mainstay in our family (mom is a big fan; has over 26 of his orignal record albums) for years. Grew up listening to the old country honky tonk and steel guitars and miss them terribly in todays music. When I located this video of his,I did not hesitate to purchase. The price was exceptionally low, which made it even sweeter. The song list is wonderful. All the 70's and early 80 hits. I even kept a VCR for this product only. I will be back to buy more of Conway items from this seller, as well as what Amazon has to offer. We do not care if they were #1's or not, his voice, highs and lows and the steel guitar is what we love."
4,Good suspense,"I really enjoyed Jimmy Hurd's first novel. Good twists, turns, and suspense. I also enjoyed the colloquialism- since I live in the south and have visited many of the places in the book. Nice character development and just an overall entertaining story."
5,Turnaround,"I couldn't put the book down, the storyline was exciting, sensual and full of suspense. The description and details given about the characters made me feel as though I have known them for years and was a part of this unfolding series of events. I can't wait for the next book Ice Dancer. I expect Jimmy Hurd will have us holding on to our seats.S.T."
4,Great Debut,"Great songs, great playing, great arrangments and melodies. Also, the only Tull album without Martin Barre, so it's interesting for that. And also because of the blues feeling of the songs. It's not indicative of what they were later to do and accomplish, but any band should be proud of this disc. Especially Beggars Farm. Ian's first mind bogglingly great song."
4,This Still Is,"Aqualung overshadows the early Tull catalogue, and that's too bad because this first album is head and shoulders above a lot of the contemporary competition. The musicianship really shines, and although the obligatory drum solo from ""Dharma For One"" is tedious, it speaks to its time. Many of these are blues riffs, and that's why the album stands up over time. The CD is remastered and the sound is sparkling, a nice glimpse backward in time. Worth picking up if you never knew the early Tull oeuvre."
4,So not Jethro tull,If you like guitar you will love Cat's squirrel. But Dharma for One has some amazing drum work. Much better than all the Tull albums after Benefit(excluding Living in the PAST)
4,Raw & Imaginative,"If your looking for albums sounding like 'Aqualung', 'Thick as a Brick', or 'Songs From the Wood' - This is not for you !But, if your a Tull-head, it's a must have. Ian's flute playing is raw and some of the vocals are OK, but this was a starting point to one of the most imaginative rock and roll bands EVER !This is heavy on blues(Move on Alone), jazz(Seranade to a Cuckoo), and 60s progressive rock(My Sunday Feeling). This is a great CD to listen to when your feeling good and mellow. I, for one, think its a solid effort for a debut recording !Better days were ahead of Jethro Tull, but by the sounds of this recording, you knew it would happen ! Way to much tallent here to be not recognized."
4,Tull's first album,"Those looking for the Tull sound of the '70s won't know what to make of this one -- though it IS good. There's very little here to hint at the beautifully developed music they would soon produce.Very bluesy in a '60s way. Charmingly rough around the edges. After This Was, Ian Anderson really starts to make Tull HIS band."
3,Could Have Been Better,"I love the album version so much that I had such high expectations for the maxi-single. All of the songs sound the same and none of them really compare to the original. It's too bad the song fell off the charts so quickly, I think it was because of poor publicity."
2,Madonna can't enlist decent remixers,"You'd think that someone with Madonna's clout and respect in music and more prominently, the music industry, could enlist decent remixers of her work. 'Nothing' is by itself a great song- galloping beat and spacey effects. But pornmongers Club 69 only reduce it to standard 'thumpthumpthump' eighties disco mediocrity. Same with the bloated K and D mix. Vikram could have been on to something with their Eastern style instrumentation, but their mix goes nowhere. This disc reminds me of U2's recent attempt at remixes. For such respected artists, U2 could only get C+C Music Factory leftovers, a laughable tossoff from Roni Size, and the wankers from Garbage. Seems only the new metal bands and Reznor can get quality reconstructions these days. Avoid 'Nothing,' and pick up Ray of Light."
2,Boring,"WAY too many Club 69 mixes, in my opinion. I could never really get into them. if you want to hear the same remix in 6 different versions, knock yourself out. The most interesting mixes on here are the vikram and kruder/dorfmeister ones."
3,good deal,I only have half of this single. The truth is this CD is also released as a set of 2 discs being sold seperately with songs scattered around. So if you could pay 1 price and collect all the mixes it sounds like a good deal to me. (except you don't get both cover pictures)
1,Madonna Doesn't Matter,She's right- nothing really matters including her and her music. Dumb video too. A bunch of people with plastic bags and Madonna dancing in a tunnel. Is that art?
5,Best ROL Maxi Single,"Nothing Really Matters is one of the best songs from her 1998 album Ray of Light, and though this single's release was pushed back month after month, it was definately worth the wait. This is in my opinion the best maxi single released from the ROL album (they were all spectacular, yes even POG). Many of the remixes on this are done by Club 69 who do a wonderful job. There are other remixes like the Vikram remix and many more. These are very good remixes, its a shame this single didn't perform well because it has potential. If you get one ROL single this would be the best one, with 9 tracks and great remixes."
3,One problem,"They are great looking, and my grand-daughter loves them, however, they keep peeling off the wall."
2,Cute but...,I bought the Princess for my daughter and Mickey for my son. I did everything the directions said but an hour after putting the princess stickers up a few started to come off. 3 days later they are all starting to come off. They look really cute when they are up I just wish they would stay up.
4,Disney Princess stickers,Cute Princess stickers for little girls' room. Add personality to her bedroom. Colorful and good quality.
1,So much potential,"I was so excited to find this book as I am a ""Godfather"" expert. (I guess you could say I'm the Godfather of Godfather books!)In any case, it's not the author's fault that this book is shallow and falls way short of expectations. It's really due to the fact that the powers that be at Paramount wouldn't let these guys use more references from the movie. As such, the ""messages"" are watered down and lose their impact. Great idea, but impossible to pull off without using the movie quotes..."
5,Café Alibi is an intoxicating journey,"In this remarkable collection of poems, Todd Swift deftly moves from the seemingly banal and everyday to the sublime, exploring both in life and in love. The poems are deeply personal--and yet you will find yourself within the many layers of his tightly written verses. Mr. Swift's poems will transport you to other places and times, foreign and yet as close as home, and have you yearning to visit Café Alibi again and again, each time discovering the richness and wonder that is life itself."
1,This book was very boring.,It took me weeks to finish it. It would be so boring that I had to put it down and wait a few days then come back to read it. The storyline was very weak.
3,Took a minute,"The beginning was sort of boring, but if you keep reading the story gets more interesting. It turned out to be a nice story; just need to give it a chance."
5,The best series on lighting currently available.,This series has the clearest diagrams to help you understand how to set up your lighting for all types of problems and challenges. Anyone serious about learning studio lighting techniques should have these books as references and idea generators.
3,Buy the newer version if you can,"Still Life and Special Effects Photography: A Guide to Professional Lighting Techniques, Second EditionorStill Life and Special Effects Photography: A Guide to Professional Lighting Techniques, Second EditionBoth the above books have the same information and more. I mean EXACTLY the same images and text, so if you already own either of those two, don't buy this one. I speak from experience!The rotovision books are great and almost always 5 star. In this case, I purchased this book used and didn't know I was getting something I already had in my library. In this case, again, the newest of the books is less expensive than buying the used version."
5,Love the patterns!,"Love the Flag pattern! Have made it twice, going to make one for both my brothers, my father was in the Army and he loved it!"
5,A Teacher,This was a sweet story of a teacher in a very small town. She had seventeen pupils in all. There was much philosophical dialogue within herself as she approached the needs of the various children. I found it interesting to read of such interest a teacher might have in the wellbeing of her students. The book was written in 1947 and encompassed the war period. I enjoyed the book all the way through to the end.
2,Disappointing!,"This book is actually a patchwork of vignettes dealing with urban topics. There is no continuity and no actual discussion of the topics introduced as chapter headings. These simply provide a starting point for presenting two or three specific stories. Though some are of interest, the lack of overall framework makes the book rather pointless.The layout is hopelessly antiquated with all (black and white) illustrations concentrated in four series of unnumbered pages placed at regular intervals in the main text.There can be no reason to recommend this collage to anyone."
1,Wingdings and other crap,"This books looks sleek, if you judge it by its cover, but that is the only ""slightly"" interesting tattoo in the whole thing. The Book looks like the author simply took Microsoft Word Fonts such as Wingding and others with symbols, and pasted them onto his pages. Its all a load of crap, not worth the paper its printed on. A HUGE disappointment."
1,worse than toilet paper,I have always had a fascination of tattoo's and have collected many books and magazines about it. But this is by far the worst use of money I have ever done.The illustrations look like something drawn by somebody in a kindergarden.This is just plain waste of money
1,It's handy if you've run out of toilet roll...,"This book is a disgrace. If Amazon allowed a rating of zero stars it would be too many for this book of 'tattoos'. The author, and publisher, should be hog-tied and tattooed with the rubbish which passes for designs in these pages.The cover misleads the buyer into thinking they're getting 500 genuine tattoo designs; they're not. Save your pennies and buy a child's' colouring book. I'm writing a letter of complaint to the publisher.A truly, truly awful buy!"
1,This book sucks!,This book is a waste of money. You will not find anything you need....Complete waste of time!
4,Nice,"This is a pretty nice hardback little book here, great quality as i was saying. But most of the pictures are pretty darn cheesy...But overall you get what you pay for!:)"
1,Not for beginners,"I have read some reviews that say ""This book is great for people who want to learn how to tattoo"". I say ""NOT"". To say that would be the equivalent of saying 'this book is good for people who want to permanently mark other people that dont know how to draw in the first place'. I encourage that anyone who wants to become a tattoo artist NOT to jump into the profession with this book in their arms but to go out and learn how to draw and maybe more specifically learn what kind of designs are majorly picked for tattoos and work on getting good at drawing those pieces of art. but MOSTLY just get out there and become a better artist in the first place and NOT rely upon books like this."
3,its ok,it was ok it only has two pages of skull designs and not many hearts or stars alot of traibal and cultural designs
1,save yourself; look for tattoo art elsewhere!,i regret purchasing this product; it is worthless! there is not a single usable or decent tattoo design in this crappy book- there are however; 500 tiny pictures of the most badly drawn and unoriginal clip art i have ever seen. i wouldn't wish any of those sorry excuses for artwork tattooed on anyone. the picture on the cover is far better than anything you will actually find inside... if u r looking for real ideas for tattoo design- for the love of God look elsewhere.
2,not good,"This book is just bad the designs are childish, and undeveloped. I give it a two only because I have used a couple of the images but only after alot of altering."
1,Horrible,"Complete waste of money, I'm an artist and I can draw all of these pictures better than the book. I thought this book would give me ideas, instead it went right on my book shelf never to be read again."
2,a good start,lots of visuals but very cheesy. some good ideas but not for those with an imagination.take a pass
4,Good for something other than tatoo.,"This book has been very useful for me as a mosaic artist. Many of my clients have selected a dragon, or mystic sign, etc. from the pages and I have worked it into a mosaic mural or panel. These type of images are not seen in mosaic books. Mosaic stuff is usually very tame and cutesy.That is why I often pick up tatoo and fantasy art books. The basic line drawing style in this one, I assume, is meant as a guidline to an artist. And, if I were a tatoo artist, hopefully I would have enough imagination and creativity to be able to do something with this very wide range of templates. That is what separates the artists from the copiers.However, I do agree that some more information on the meaning of some of these symbols would be very useful. To the hardcore artists, you think this crap, wait till you see the stuff mosaic artists are presented with as source books. This is a great little book and I like it!"
2,Misled,"I was under the impression that there would be meanings for most of the designs.Don't get me wrong, there were some nice designs, but, I was looking for meanings for the symbols and drawings."
1,childs book,verry disapointed in the book i mean the cover looks cool but there arnt any desighns that even look real its more like a childs picture book after this disapointment i decided to publish my own book ...
1,a hard back coloring book,so not worth full price buy it used or discounted if possible there were only a few patterens in it which can be seen online wish i would of never ordered it and spent my money on a more deserving design book !
1,What Do I Do Now?,"Purchased these and they DON'T WORK. Have tried many discs from stack and none are recordable. It's not like I can return them since they're open. My computer and burner are capable at burning at 8x speed, but the discs are worthless. So what am I supposed to do with them now? I was robbed!"
2,Coaster Mania,I've actually used Memorex before DVD-R 4x 50 pack with no issues.This batch I'm coastering about 25-30% of these.
2,disapointed...,"The last memorex dvd-r I used was in 25 disk bundle, they works fine. I only have an older 4x burner. I was able to burn with 4x without any problems. But having a lot of problem with this 100 disk bundle. When I burn it with 4x speed, the data can't be recognized by the dvd-rom. After burning, the DVD rom still see the disk as a blank disk. :( But my dvd player is able to recognize those disks. They definitely have some reflectivity issues. Now, I only burned this DVD-r using 2x speed. Painfully slow (30 minute per disk), but this is the only way then I can get a good disk. So, my advice is to avoid this product. It might or might not work on some dvd-burner on high speed..."
2,Bad quality DVD-R can't even burn at 8x,I have a NEC ND-2500a which is a very respectable dvd burner. I just got these DVD-Rs today and tried to burn on them and can't even get 8x speed. The only option Nero allowed me was 4x. What a bunch of lies I got from the DVD-Rs which advertised 8x....
1,Will NOT play on many DVD players,"Using MAC and iMovie to make home DVD movies. All played OK on a Magnavox MDV560 VR DVD player, but was intermittent (hangs) on a TOSHIBA SD-3800 DVD player. Thought player was bad. Purchased 2 more DVD players yesterday and got varying results but mostly bad - hanging or not recognizing the DVD at all. Switched to Maxell and so far all playing good with NO hangs."
4,MUSICAL ENCHANTMENT,"Paisello was the official composer for Emperor Napoleon Bonepart in the days when such personnel were essential for the running of an empire. He therefore was contemporary with Mozart and Beethoven.These charming pieces are a delight to the classically formal ear. The performances are satisfying and the melodies linger in the head.It is the production which is not 5 star. Silences need to be deep black, sound ranges need to be clear. I hope theses concertos get into the concert repertoirs of stage performers so we can listen to them more often."
5,"Humorous,uplifting and inspiring",I LOVED this book - a truly inspirational look at a real person's search for the angels in their life. Funny anecdotes and honest spirituality made this book all the more believable to those of us who are interested in gaining more meaning in our lives.
3,Good speakers,"These speakers sound great. Mazda Miata with a Sony DSXS100 receiver and a JVC KS-AX3002 Power Amplifier . They handle really high volumes with no buzzing or strange distortion. These are NOT a direct drop in replacement for the factory speakers, I had to drill new holes for the mounting. WARNING don't bother with the template on the box, it it wrong (too small).Gave the 3 stars because there is no installation information and the template on the box is too small...not the same size as the speakers."
2,clear as a bell,great hi's and mid range. dont expect bump from these . you need a full sub set-up to get the full effect. ( i had to redo this review. they sounded great when they were working but they quit working the other day. )
2,"Inexpensive speaker, and you get what you pay for ...","They work, but not very well. One speaker either arrived defective or developed a rattling sound in the cone shortly after installation. I should have paid more for a higher quality speaker."
4,two beautiful songs!!,"This is a great CD if you don't want to buy the whole album, but the full album is also worth it!These are two of my favorite songs from Madonna and it was a perfect matchup for this single LP.What more can be said? It's Madonna in her new form, not her old candy pop."
5,Amazing song,"This is one of Madonna's most amazing songs, and the single is great too. It is one of my personal favorite CD Single Cover artworks for a Madonna song. The B-Side to this is okay, but the single's title track is worth every penny."
2,It really does matter !,"I was very disappointed with this cd single.I love the song, but could not find a decent remix that I liked on the single.If you are looking for a good remix of this song, then try the ""Ray of Light remixes"" cd.There is a good remix of this song on it.Buy it if you are a huge Madonna fan, otherwise forget it."
2,Very limited Spanish.,"I bought this to help me teach Spanish to my grandchildren and I was quite disappointed. It is mostly arts & crafts and VERY little Spanish. And when it says ""Basic Spanish,"" it really means basic."
2,waste of time,"This book is cute, and if you don't know how to speak spanish, but claim to teach it, this book is a great way to waste time cutting, pasting, and coloring. However, thats about all this book is good for. If you are serious about teaching/learning spanish, this book is not for you."
5,Amazing,Love this performance. Jeff has a top notch band. All the players are entertaining showmen and virtuoso musicians. The camera work is really good showing Jeff's hands a lot so you can see his extraordinary technique. My son an aspiring guitarist watched this with me and while he wasnt totally convinced by the bluesy simplicity of the music (he likes strong melodic artists like Yes and Rush). I knew the video impacted him because the next time I saw him on the guitar he had lost the pic and I haven't seen him use a pic again. Angel Footsteps is Amazing then again there really isn't a track here that doesn't shine.
5,Very good,"What can you say about Jeff live besides it's a perfect show. His band is smokin! Vinnie C tears it up. The only thing that was off-key for me (to use a phrase) was the female singers. Joss was good and better than the other woman, but I am more of a music man than a song man. The encore was amazing. For 10$- unbaleevable!!! You can't find a better deal musically! Watch the interview and the extras. Besides, I play guitar and some of the stuff they show Jeff doing on this was mind blowing ( rethink slide guitar )."
5,Great DVD!,"This is a great DVD. If you even remotely like Jeff Beck, it's worth the money and then some. Don't forget to pick out Robert Plant and Jimmy Page in the audience. Can't say enough about this concert. Buy it."
5,Simply one of the Best,"Complete mastery of the guitar, multi disciplined, Same type of music will get old no matter how well played. Rest of the band is just as good. Saw this group (different drummer) from second row in the pit at Wolftrap. Just an indescribable experience. My 14 yr old grandson (!!) couldn't believe music could be that good. (Sad commentary as to what's out there today....takes a 67 yr old rocker to inspire a 14 yr old)"
4,Great band deserves a great place !,"This blu-ray has a great sound in DTS and an excellent video quality. Jeff Beck's guitar had a fantastic recording, capturing all the sounds of the instrument. The same to the others musicians, each one with theirs qualities. Vinnye Colaiuta plays drums with great, great technic, but it seems that he is just resting. The 21 years old bass player girl has the personality of a 50 years old musician, and her look is charming. And the singers and Eric Clapton are great on the few songs that they appear. The jazz-rock is full of personality and emotional. The show should be recorded in a theather, with a good stage. But the perfection is impossible. By now !!!"
5,The best guitar DVD of the decade!!,If you play rock guitar you need to watch this. Clapton show up on stage as do Page and Plant in crowd. Bassist is unreal.
5,Beck sails on,"If you are reading this & considering this DVD, you know Jeff Beck & what he has been up to. I have waited a long time for a great quality video of JB doing his thing, and this is it. All of Jeff's unique techniques, great tone, and killer melody is here, surrounded by a world class group on musicians. Nothing is stiff- they are all enjoying the heck out of playing with each other, and Jeff is at his legendary best.JB just continues to amaze & inspire me!"
5,BEST,This is Jeff Beck's best DVD. I know many people bought this because of the young girl. Haha!! No comment on her.
5,This is a Must-Have,"Five hundered years from now, when aliens review the work that was once mankind's, they will build a monument to this DVD. Not a gap to the playing or the filming to be seen. Amazing."
5,excellent,Jeff Beck plays to a small crowd in an intimate setting and boy can he play.The sound quality was great and the video is crisp.
3,Jeff Beck-,Purchased this as a gift for my son-in-law and I was really surprised that there was a good selection of material I can get from you. Thanks for making my shopping easier.
5,Jeff Beck,"I have been a Jeff Beck fan for as long as I can remember. If you are one of these people, then you must get this. I also purchaced the CD, but it is way more enjoyable to watch him as well as listen to him. And the video is NOT one of these creations that feels you have to keep the camera moving in order to like it. It actually stays on the subject so you can actually see whats happening, instead of getting sea sick trying to watch. So anyway...... this is a must for Beck fans.... Beck... as in the one who really plays music.. Not that other one"
5,Great Faucet Trim,Very well made with a high quality finish.This trim mounted very easily to theKOHLER K-410-K-NA Two-Handle Ceramic Valve.
2,I had to buy this book...,"...for a class I'm taking. It's easy enough to read and has some good information in it. Some of the links it suggests are outdated, and much of the material is rather elementary. If you already know how to search on the internet, you probably won't find much of anything new in here. It's not a book I would have bought if I didn't have to have it for this class."
4,Decent Map,"Despite the copyright date, I have been using this map to get around Baltimore for the last three months and have yet to find anything outdated. City streets usually stay put. My only complaint is that it doesn't cover enough area. You are still very much in the city when you leave the part that the map covers. Overall, an extremely useful map."
3,DARCI DECORATES REVIEW,"Im currently taking the Wilton classes (course #2) and I thought this video would make a nice addition to my lessons, as Im a VERY visual learner.The video isn't bad, it is very viewable. However I did not find it to be very instructive. Darci flies thru a few basic methods and then flies thru instructions on how to make the rose. Not helpful in the least. However I did learn from her some excellent idea regarding the way to smoothly foundation ice a cake.If you've never taken a class, this might be a good investment. I personally find the classes to be a better investment."
4,Great for the beginning decorater,"Darci does a great job teaching basic cake decorating techniques. She covers everything from how to bake the cake, to making the perfect icing, to applying the icing, and then shows several decorated cakes. This is perfect for a beginner. Her bubbly personality only adds to the DVD."
3,Okay but could be better,"Not what i expected for the money. Did have some good information for the beginner, but certainly could have been better. Cakes demonstrated were very simple grocery store bakery style cakes. Did show how to do borders, roses, icing and other basics. However, i have seen about the same basic information on youtube. The material looked very dated and low budget quality film. Had simple start to finish projects but went through them quickly and would just say things like use tip # 23, but never explained how tips are numbered or things like that. Overall not bad but considering all the free videos on youtube with basically the same info it is not worth the money in my opinion."
2,cake decorating ideas,This is a very elemental cake decorating presentation with not much going for it. Looked like sloppy work to me. Not at all impressed.
4,Say CD..eeeeee....,"The best thing about this book is the in-depth soultions to extra problems found only in the CD. So be sure to ask for the CD that accompanies the book; on top of that you get a solid fluid mechanics book that will support you through your fluid classes. A foundational understanding in fluids will also help in classes like Heat Transfer where most of the information is building on information learned in fluids. Good book, good examples, I like a lot of one of the author's (Okiishi) stuff."
2,Dont rely only on this book,"If you are cursed with a poor professor and are forced to use the book to teach yourself the material, you will be sorely dissapointed. First of all, the book is extremely wordy and very complicated to understand. You are given a ton of equations when they talk about a topic but you almost always find no use for the majority of them. I find the later chaptersespecially to be all math oriented and I found fewer and fewer real world problems to help study for the exams which had real world questions. In general, I was very dissapointed with the book.The study guide that accompanes the book is actually fairly decent and succint if not too short and they sometimes dont show important equations"
3,Great for travel,"Great for traveling with toys or toiletries. My sister uses one for her daughter's hair products, accessories when they are traveling."
3,Great for bringing home the jewels!,"This book was an extremely useful tool for my wife and me as we combed the back country of Utah, gathering rocks. From the litle-known sites like Painter's Spring in West Desert, to the world-famous Dugway geode beds, this book gave us the directions we needed. The petrified wood sites in southern Utah were especially appreciated."
3,gem trails,"Like ""Rockhounding Utah"" this book provides good tips and hints at areas but a lot of the areas are picked clean. My advice would be to find a hardcore rock hounder and tag along or join one of the different mineral societies in the state of Utah there are quite a few. i hope this helps all you future rock hounds don't give up there are others out there just like you searching!"
5,Gem Trials of Utah,This is a great book. Contains a lot of good information and we were pleased with the detail of the maps.
2,Old Information,I should have realized that with the item being 30 years old (revised 1987) that the information was very outdated. Not seller's fault. Should have read description better.
2,Software too old,"This product is okay, but if you're like me and use Windows 7, this product is a little too ""old school"". There was really nothing I could use this for. You would really be better off getting the newer version."
4,"Beautiful, powerful, and noisy.","Both from the musical and scenical points of view, this is a great performance of Meyerbeer's opera with the elegant and beautiful Shirley Verrett, the powerful Domingo and Ruth Ann Swenson.However I should have prefered to have much less noise in the recording. Sometimes I am tempted to turn off the DVD for it sound more like a workshop than an opera house. This is a minus five star performance of the sound engineers, in an otherwise great opera recording."
3,Better Than It Deserves,"This is a somewhat mediocre opera given a great production that employs some superb talent. Domingo, Verrett and Swenson are in fine voice, the production values are top-notch, but the material is second-rate and terribly old-fashioned. (At times one can practically sense the singers trying awfully hard to keep a straight face.) This is neither Meyerbeer's nor Scribe's finest hour: a hokey, historically inaccurate (of course) mess which fails both musically and dramatically. (The emotionally fickle tenor [i.e. one of the stars!] disappears 3/4s of the way through, never to be heard from again. How bizarre is that?) Everyone involved acquits themselves admirably, but what is fun and colorful for the first few acts quickly becomes tiresome and dull. Whereas it's great to see the little-filmed Verrett and Swenson, there are certainly better opportunities to see Domingo in DVDs of finer operas. A curiosity, certainly...but not worth full price."
3,Worthy movie to view.,The Promise is a pretty good movie that tells the story of two lovers seperated by The Berlin Wall. It's quite interesting and all the people involved in this film do well in their roles. I especially think that the music of The Promise is quite emotional and fitting. The soundtrack no doubt adds something to this movie in my opinion. Give this a watch.
5,VHS from Ronsbookbarn,"I just wanted to say, that I thought I was just getting a VHS tape, but this seller included a DVD of the film as well. It was so great! I didn't have to set up the old VCR after all."
4,Fleamarket books has great customer service,"Fleamarketbooks handled the shipping of ""The Promise"" video. I was dissatisfied with the VHS tape, but customer service was extremely accomodating in communicating with me and issuing a prompt refund. They are good people!"
5,AWESOME,"This book is totally worth its money, just in the first few pages, I've got tons of new ideas. She is amazing!"
5,Great Book!,"If you are in direct sales this book is a must! Lots of great information and wonderful ideas to try. Well written, is a great read!!!"
3,"Lots of questions, few answers","The overarching impression I was left with was the lack of details in many of the articles. There was a lot of ""talking around"" the issue without a lot of specifics as to what actually did and did not occur. I guess I was looking at something a bit more investigative than what was presented here.The articles ran the gamut. There were some with an obvious church-bashing agenda. There were a few self-flagellating articles written by churchmen and women. And there were a few that highlighted the heroic efforts made in countless churches, convents and monasteries across Rwanda.What it was difficult to come away with from the book was the extent of the church's complicity. That's what I had hoped to glean from this book, but alas it wasn't to be."
3,It was OK.,"I love romance novels that deal with Native Americans, and for this reason I picked up this novel. I read it quickly, and while I enjoyed most of it, I couldn't help but feel that some of it was just too...cheesy? It's good if you want a quick read, but the plot seems a little too unreal at times."
1,Don't buy this garbage. Tabloid writer,"If you feal like taking advantage of the rest of your family, by all means read this garbage. She writes for the NY Post. a tabloid. DO NOT TAKE HER ADVISE.....TRUST ME. Don't waste your time buying this garbage."
1,Sensationalist Author Comes Up Short,The whole thing is very sensationalist. It's the typical over-the-top style we see from Kaja (who also writes for the NY Post Tabloid). If you're looking for guidance on preparing your estate keep looking! There are many other books out there for just this subject which CAN be taken seriously.
1,Not Helpful!,I borrowed this book from my friend and found it full of boiler plate information. It was not very helpful. I hope this helps.
1,Not really worth it,"Sometimes I am amused by why some people write and more amazed by people who buy this kind of stuff.I guess the title is more catchy ""what your lawyer may not tell you about..."". The fact is ""what your author may not tell you ... is One can find more material after searching 1 hr on net""."
5,Excellent Outline of Calvin's Thought,"I had read significant portions of Calvin's Institutes before I encountered Wendel but I still found his analysis of Calvin extremely helpful. Wendel is fair and sympathetic to Calvin, but not afraid to point out some of the idiosyncracies in his thought. Thus Calvin is described as being ""Christocentric"" in orientation, but Wendel concedes that Calvin's christology takes on unusual hues as the Genevan grapples with the nature of the physicality of the resurrected Christ."
1,EPIC FAIL,I'm only 270 pages in. I have yet to see anything useful.Part 1 is a broad and deeply flawed overview of linear narrative basics.Part 2 is a brief and iffy overview of game design.Part 3 has (so far) been an ignorant rant against interactive storytelling.OUCH!!!
3,Decorating Outside the Box,"If nothing else, Mary Carol gives us a few new ideas of decorating outside the box, so to speak. Her style is a mix between traditional and eclectic, so she gives us a bit of everything in this book. I bought my copy of the book for my design library for just a few dollars and worth that price."
3,alright,"Speakers are good for their money. There's no thump whatsoever, which I was very disappointed with since other websites have listed their frequency at 55Hz-23kHz. That being said they're amazingly clear...until you try to crank them past 3/4 volume on the head unit. The many holes on their mounting bracket made it very easy to install, that's the one real good thing I could say about them."
5,I wish I could have been there when the pictures were taken!,"This book is excellent. It made me jelous that I couldn't experience the atmosphere of the time. The stars in the pictures range from Jerry Garcia to Iggy Pop, from Jimmy Hendrix to Dr. Dre. The photography is awesome. It really captures the attitdue of the musician. I would recommend this book to any one impressed by the talent of these outstanding artists. I am 18 and I loved the book. My dad is 50 and liked the book just as much!!!!!"
5,Classics,"it's a Rolling Stone Magazine book full of photos from all kinds of rock artists taken by some of the best photographers around, need say anything else ?"
2,When the World was Steady,"Initially the book captivated me with its wonderful descriptions. I was transported to Bali and London and caught up in the conflict of the two sisters. Through this the author provided such potential for a riviting plot I eagerly read on, only to be disappointed. The characters were left out to dry. The resolution to their conflicts was anti-climatic, and the decriptive language which originally had painted such vivid pictures became what seemed to be an over use of the author's thesaurus."
5,A MARVELOUS CONTRAST OF TWO SISTERS,"I READ THIS BOOK TWO MONTHS AGO, BUT AM STILL THINKING ABOUT ONE SISTER'S ADVENTURE IN BALI, CONTRASTED TO THE STRAIGHT-LACED LIFE OF THE OTHER SISTER IN LONDON. IF YOU READ BOOKS BECAUSE YOU LOVE TO BE TRANSPORTED, YOU'LL LOVE IT. IF YOU HAVE SISTERS WHO LIVE THEIR LIVES DIFFERENTLY THAN YOU DO, IT'S GREAT. IF YOU WANT TO MEET PEOPLE WHO DON'T LIVE IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD, READ THIS BOOK!"
1,Not what I expected,"I have a lot of Ateco cookie cutters and they have all been shipped in nice containers and store easily. This was just a piece of metal wrapped in plastic at the bottom of my box. I didn't realize what it was at first. The metal is really thin and flimsy, I wouldn't recommend this product."
1,TOO SMALL TO BE A GIFT,"I bought this heart shaped pendant with a chain for a Valentine's Day gift for one of my daughters who attends college out of town. I thought it would be something she could keep as a remembrance, rather than the usual card and stuffed animal. Well when I finally saw it in person, I was appalled at how small and insignificant it was. It also has a somewhat ""plastic"" quality to it. If you want to buy something as a memorable gift, don't buy this!"
1,Simply Armenian,"The woman can write well, but as I rewied the book I purchased I realized that she has no clue about cooking. One example, under shish kebab (lamb) one of the ingredients is balsamic vinegar. Now this sounds good but don't sell me a book of Simply Armenian recieps when balsamic vinegar as an ingredient is not even in the ethnic cooking picture. Overall the book has many good qualities such as history but the reciepes are not what I expected. It's a false marketing (Ethnic Cooking)"
3,Myeah.....,This book is no different from other Armenian cookbooks that mix Armenian recipes with non-Armenian recipes with little or no differentiation. Some interesting entries...
2,A card holder that tips too easily,"We were hoping to be able to use this card holder to slide from person to person at a big table. The rotating mechanism has only three rubber bumpers on the bottom, so it tips too easily when you move it or even rotate it. Also, you must place cards EXACTLY SQUARELY in the tray or they catch on the sides and prop at an angle. It's a pain. We stopped using it already."
5,Revolving Playing Card Tray/Holder,It is wonderful for holding many decks of cards required in playing Canasta. I also use the holder for storing the cards in the box supplied with the holder.
5,Dandy gadget,"We play a lot of card games, and the stacks always get messed up. This is the perfect solution. And it is easy to slide down a long table so everyone can reach the draw pile."
4,Stop cards from sliding off the table,"We play ""hand and foot"" with several friends and relatives and I got tired of the large stack(s) of cards getting knocked over so when I saw this I thought this would be the answer. That has proven to be true. It's worked as advertised and performed well. We have found that it works best to have cards in both trays in roughly equal amounts if you don't do this and get too many cards on one side it leans and doesn't work as well. It's a minor glitch and worth dealing with to keep a neater card game."
3,card holder,"Nice product. Holds up to 6 decks of cards. Ordered several. One was broken when it arrived, but was cheap enough that I fixed it rather than try to return it."
4,Exactly as ordered,Card Holder holds 6 decks as stated and rotating base makes it easy for all players. Recommend for ease of holding up to 6 decks in place.
5,Playing Card Tray Holder,"Item was exactly as described. Service was fast, packaging was excellent. Would not hesitate to purchase from this site in the future."
3,chintzy,It is made of cheap plastic and the shipping was almost more than the product. Not worth the price.
3,Good Card Holder,It holds the card great but it tends to dip on either end. Sorta rocks back and forth.
2,cardholder,This was received in good shape but the shufflers had one card l shaped holder missing. Please send this missing piece. They were all mailed together.
2,Card Shuffler,Well the shuffler did not work when we gave it at Christmas so i guess we will look into sending it back. So sorry for that.
2,VERY TIPPY,COULD NOT USE THE HOLDER WITHOUT MODIFICATION AS IT WILL TIP AND NOT SWIVEL WITH CARDS IN ONE SIDE. i HAD TO BREAK THE SWIVEL BASE OFF AND BUY STICK ON FELT PADS TO ATTACH TO THE BASE.
3,Card Holder,This is an inexpensive item that does what it's intended to. The axle for the rotation of the tray could be a tigher fit as the tray is tippy when only one side is full (for instance at the start of a card game).
2,Dubious,"I bought the product for use in three-deck+ Canasta. The tray certainly accommodates that many cards and keeps them from spilling out but fails to produce anticipated results.The intention was that the tray would hold the discard pile in a neat stack, preventing less scrupulous players from viewing the cards below the top discard. The tray sides are just narrow enough that the cards constantly hang up or go in crooked when dropped in, requiring constant readjustment.The swivel base is a good idea, but is wobbly and rattily."
2,Broken when arrived,This came with a large crack and a large chip. My neighbor ordered one as well it had a the same crack and chip.. I will not return it because I have to pay postage and after pay to have this item shipped two times ...not cost effective. This is why I don't buy on line often.
5,Really like,"It does tip a little to one side, but that is because all the cards are on one side, it evens out as you play."
4,Hand & foot Tray,Tray works great and will hold several decks of cards when playing hand & foot. It easily moves within easy reach of all players around the table. The discards sometimes do not lay straight in the discard tray when tossed into the tray. Not a serious problem.
4,Card trayThis device is very handy - kleeps,This device is very useful. We often play card games using three or more decks and the tray helpd keep things organized.
4,It's great!!,My card group plays with 4 or 5 decks and this holder makes it easier to pull cards from the stack. It also rotates so that's goood for all sides of the table.
1,revolving playing card holder,The card holder rocks back and forth if there R tomany cards on one side. You have to put the cards all on one side to B able to play the game.
5,A must have,"If you play cards at all, and especially if a lot, this holder is the things to have. Good for use on the beach, or cruising, or slippery tables - holds the cards where they belong. I bought two."
5,excellent,works great. would order again.works very well when playing with group of people.keeps cards contained. you will like it
3,Tips to one side,"Not stable,with four decks in it it tips to one side. A real pain when you try to rotate it."
2,wobbly,"good quality. the concept is great, however the tray bounces all over due to the design of a round swivel under the rectangular piece (which is too lightweight to maintain a level position). i have a plain tray (no swivel) for 1 deck, that i put the felt chair glide pieces on and it works better than this one (my opinion)."
2,History,"This book is not for low level readers. It is really quite interesting in some parts, but there are some which do not keep the reader's attention. More pictures and graphics would increase the interest of the readers. There is so much to read in the book, along with the class time in college, that it took up way too much time. For the last exam, I did not read the book. I just went off what the professor had taught us in class, as the lecture was more interesting than the book. If I were to write a book, I would want it to be more intriguing than a lecture. So, adding graphics and pictures of the past would help intensely in my point of view. I feel there is something missing to intise the readers, but I just can't put my finger on it."
2,great'album great'artist,this is a great album and a great artist with albert king theres no going wrong when you buy one of his albums. he is the king of electric-blues. you can hear all these songs in great format. just awsome playing awsome singing. its sure no wonder srv. and hendrix really loved albert king.
4,Very good if you only want one disc,"""The Very Best Of Albert King"" does a really good job drawing from King's 60s output and his soul-influenced latter-day recordings alike, and this is a very good single-disc overview of his career.A couple of the selections are debatable, as always when you make a compilation, but almost all of the must-have classics are here, including ""Let's Have A Natural Ball"", ""Don't Throw Your Love On Me So Strong"", ""Crosscut Saw"", ""Born Under A Bad Sign"", ""Laundromat Blues"" and ""I'll Play The Blues For You"".(""The Hunter"", ""Down Don't Bother Me"" and a few others are missing, though, which is a shame.)Rhino's double-disc ""The Ultimate Collection"" is a lot more comprehensive, however, and contains almost every track from King's superb ""Born Under A Bad Sign"" LP. If you really only want one Albert King-CD in your collection, that's the one I'd go for."
4,best single disc career overview,"Albert King was a great urban blues singera and one of the best guitarists that played the blues. This CD has 16 of his best tunes. It doesn't cover his entire work, but it is better than ""King of the blues guitar"" in this aspect, as that one featured just 1966 - 1968 material and this one spans nearly 20 years , from about the late fifties to mid seventies.However, the track list isn't stellar: I have nothing against the three pre 1966 selections, but the some of the seven tracks from his most famous period between 1966 - 1968 are odd. Why there is Cold feet, which is pretty good, but no As the years go Passing by which is more of a classic and one of his trademark tunes. It is inexcxusable to have a Best of without it. That's why I put 1 star off. The latter tracks are well chosen, so I hink you should pick this one up if you want to have just one Albert King CD. Just add As the years go passing by and you'll have ***** stars as far a single disc collection can go"
3,"Good singing, a so-so anthology","With his aw-shucks charm and winning tenor, Dick Powell hugely secured Busby Berkeley's success at Warner Bros., and inevitably he had to record. This disc, part of Columbia/Legacy's ""Art Deco"" series, has twenty Brunswick sides, mostly Warren and Dubin. But Powell's fine vocals stand foursquare against the drab arrangements typical of early Depression commercial music, performed by uncredited or little-known orchestras, all in the dull muted sound of old 78s (Legacy's excellent remastering notwithstanding); while he goes one way the rest of these recordings go another. Powell's fans (and fans of thirties movie music) will certainly like this collection; nonetheless for the definitive musical take on Berkeley I'd recommend John McGlinn's superb EMI recreation. Alas, it's deleted."
3,Way overpriced,Very effective. It is also an enjoyable way to learna new language. The only problem is they don't teach you awhole lot and it is way overpriced.It doesn't take long to complete the entire course. After completing course one I can say a few things in Russian but that is a light years away from saying I mastered the language!
5,A must for parents,"I just finished reading it. It is a must!. Covers what to do while 911 arrives and what to expect when you call 911 the role and expertise of the different health care workers you are bound to encounter and what they can do for you. Besides of the mandatory CPR overview it includes tidbits of the author experience that make reading it again worthwhile.It also informed on the gap between states on EMT service providers certifications and capabilities. It also made me wish for another certification that will train persons to perform CPR and intubation since breathing is so important.Great read, well written, clear, concise, not chatty, and a possible life saver. Despite of this I hope reading it was waste of time and never faced with the need to call 911."
1,Not much substance,"I bought this book hoping to get informed guidelines on handling emergencies involving children, while waiting for the ambulance - or even what to do or not in cases that might not merit a call to 911. However, the entire book could be summed up in one sentence: ""Call 911 and sit tight."" The author goes into all kinds of details, but I could not extract much in the way of emergency response, other than to sit by the child, reassure him/her and wait for the ambulance."
4,Review from a Pilate beginners perspective,"The author does an excellant job great job of explaining the concept of the ""B"" line which I was previouly having a lot of difficulty understanding even though I am attending classes.The author makes understandable the concepts regarding the flexing and strengthening the abdominal wall as well as the correct way to carefully stretch into the various zones of comfort in order to progress with the excercises.My overall flexibilty and body stance has improved dramatically since adopting Pilates as an excercise regime and reading this book."
4,Very applicable to all,"I really enjoyed this book, it gave alot of insight into the pilates method, I purchased this book when I started classes so I could easily follow up at home. You will not regret giving this a go !"
5,Great Book for Beginners,"I bought this book just before I signed up for a 9 week introductory course in Pilates that was being run at a local evening college.Reading all the introductory chapters gave me a great insite into the methods and helped me with understanding better what the instructor was telling us during the first session about the method.When I got home from the each of the sessions, I was able to read about each of the excercises we completed during the session and understand better what the instructor was teaching us and also to remind me how they were done when I was doing them at home.A great book, very clear and easy to understand."
4,Its soooo easy,"I have recently started Pilates at my gym and was talking to a class mate who recommended this book for when I can't make a gym class. Not only was it fantastic, but I have started doing other classes at the gym and concentrating on pilates at home. Instructions are simple, pictures are great. What more could you want...oh yes...it really does work!"
5,New to Pilates,"I have just started pilates classes once a week. I am thoroughly enjoying the exercise - especially since the next day there are no aches & pains that usually accompany a gym workout. I was so pleased with the classes that I have done, that I decided to purchase the book in order to continue the exercises at home so that I will achieve the results I want.The benefits of the book (I have a wiro-bound copy which makes it easy when doing exercises on the floor)are that there are easy to hard variations of the exercises which means that when I get better at the excercises I won't get bored and I will be able to learn new things without having to by a new book.Also, the book is good in that the breathing techniques for each part of the exercises are highlighted in bold text which is easy to find when you actually doing the exercise and need to reaffirm your breathing.Each week I will be able to watch my progress by completing the exercise charts at the back of the book."
3,The knife is the worse I have seen,"Overall the set is okay, the knife other than butter, you can not cut anything else with it. I tried to open my mail once, and it failed! I did not mind the knife since I have a steak knife set that I use. Also the main fork is not pointy enough.So 3 out of 5 items are good, so I gave it 3 stars."
3,The long and short of it...,"Is this flatware set attractive? Nnnno. Stems are freakishly long, heads are oddly sized. Salad fork is actually a shrunken dinner fork, which looks more like a shrimp fork than anything. Finish is shinier than a set of chrome rims. Will it butter your bread and transport food from plate to mouth? Yes. Mission accomplished."
2,Wrong Book,"They sent me the wrong book. I wanted De Paseo the text book but they sent me the activity book. Also, it took a very long time (2 weeks) for the book to get here."
3,An interesting concept overshadowed by confusing storyline...,"I have been reading MTG books for a long time now, and appreciate the vibrant worlds and characters that they portray. Ravnica does this fine, but the author does a not so good job at keeping everything in order. After a while, you begin to wonder who is who, and what guild is what. Action scenes are good, but tend to be slightly confusing also. The writer brings you in depth with characters, and once you begin the understand what is going on, this is really a good book.The bottom line is, if you like the MTG series, and don't mind backtracking to find information to understand the book, then this is a good book. If not, don't pick it up."
5,Great!,The book is amazing and leaves you set up for the second book. If you want to learn more about MTG lore I would definitely pick this up
3,Play the game? Discover the plane!,"The Return to Ravnica block has already become a huge gaming success, so it may be worth it for some players & collectors to look back to its origins. I probably would not have given this book a positive review if I were not so heavily invested in the game and the plane of Ravnica. It at least attempts to convey the cultural flavor of the guilds, and the guilds are ultimately what make Ravnica more interesting than simply being Magic's urban plane. Although it sometimes reads as a confusing jumble of plotlines that don't seem to connect, I nonetheless found it worth my time to stumble through. The bottom line for me is that despite its shortcomings, I felt more ""at home"" in Ravnica after reading this novel. The author displays a good imagination coupled with a working knowledge of the plane: 3.5 stars."
5,If you love music videos...you will love this collection!,"I have always been a fan of Christian music, but I really love watching the music videos more than listening to the songs on the radio. I bought this for my dad for Christmas and he seemed to really be happy with his gift! My dad is a huge fan of Christian music and I know he likes/loves all of the songs on this DVD. It is great for a gift or even if you just want it for your own collection! I might actually buy another copy sometime soon for myself that is how much I love it!"
5,i freaking love this game,"This is one of those mindless games that you can get lost in for hours. You chose your aircraft then enter a psychedelic tunnel. In here you fly down a single path and shoot bugs. If you miss a bug it shows up again in front of you, sometimes changing into a harder bug. You can fly 360 degrees around the tunnel wall, and options allow for the tunnel to move around you or for you to move around the tunnel. When a bug has been shot a coin with the letter ""E"" on it goes shooting ahead of you. You can power this coin up by shooting it before you collect it. There are also random brown mushrooms around the tunnels which can also be charged up. Collecting these items gives you bonuses such as bonus rounds and firewalls. And with a soundtrack by the Crystal Method (basically the album Vegas) you cant go wrong. All in all, i rate this as a game you should definitely look into picking up. Also, it will play on the PS3."
3,Mr. Coffeee replacemnet decanter shipped by vendor,I bought this product through Amazon and had hoped to have it shipped by Amazon. But it was shipped by the vendor and shipping cost was to high and the order to took to long to get here. I could have gotten this same decanter a lot cheaper locally.
2,double bought,"everything pertaining to the transaction went fine, except there was miscommunication between my s.o. who had already purchased the item elsewhere. when my replacement decanter arrived, i refused to accept delivery, so it went back to p.o.p. i received my refund , but had to pay a significant ($7+) delivery charge for a ($12+) item. i thought if i refused delivery then i would be forgiven that fee.in retrospect, i will never buy anything from amazon with such a high delivery fee.furthermore, mr. coffee charges too much for replacement parts,and there are no substitutes forcing one to buy only from them at an inordinately high price."
4,Early work,"The most memorable tracks on this very first recording of the legendary Sandy Denny from 1967 are My Ramblin' Boy, The Last Thing On My Mind, Make Me A Pallet On Your Floor and You Never Wanted Me.She sings with passion as her voice dips, soars and trembles whilst her guitar playing is mesmeric. I don't like all of the songs though and I think the material she recorded with Fairport Convention was generally of a higher quality.But this is an essential album for lovers of 1960s folk music, especially of the UK variety. The genius of Denny was born and formed here on these early recordings, and her mastery of the acoustic guitar adds to the sonic enjoyment.No More Sad Refrains: The AnthologyNo More Sad Refrains: The Life and Times of Sandy Denny"
2,"Too clunky, bad description and cheap feeling","I really was disappointed when I opened the box. The bottles are quite large for 20oz, very tall (so make sure they fit under any shelving, etc. The ceramic is not a nice white, sort of a dingy cream. The colors are nothing like what you see in the picture. The vinegar bottle is a deep purple/black color.. and the oil bottle is more a green yellow (not the beige). All in all, pretty disappointing. I ended up returning to purchase the Amethyst bottles and the Frosted Oil bottle instead. Pretty happy with those."
3,The picture of the hand warmer is false,"The picture clearly shows the Jon-e with a can of Jon-e fuel although it did not come with it.Jone-e Giant Size Hand WarmerIn my opinion it is false advertising at the least. It seems to be deceitful at best. I can not review the product because I do not have any fuel. Jon-e giant size handwarmer sold by ROS, LLC The cost of the product also indicates it would come with fuel."
5,Great product!,"I used to own this product, until it broke a couple years ago, and had a very hard time finding it again, until now!I DO have all the old retro-games for my PS2, and would love to be able to play them again....the way they were meant to be played (Centipede, Crystal Castles, Marble Madness)I grew up on these games, and own them on my PS2 system, and still love playing them, but, using the OEM controller is NOT easy."
1,only has 4 buttons incompatible with most games,i bought atari classics and this . i was hoping for the old 80's missle command expierence the game ruled . this controller was incompatible. i looked it up very few games actually work with this! booo!
4,fun toy,"This toy is great. My two year old daughter got it for her birthday and it was her favorite gift. As others have mentioned the acordian part is hard for her to do at this point, but it doesn't take away her love of the item. She loves to dance to the music and point at the different characters saying their names. If you can't handle toys that make noise don't get this item as it is very loud. You need to be great at either ignoring the noise or singing along. We have fun with this one."
2,wiggles accordian,A little tight to play. Has different character buttons that play their songs which finish before another song is allowed to play. Cute toy but a little hard for real little ones to play the accordian due to its stiffness.
3,Buy Hit the High Hard One instead,"'Hit the High Hard One' is a brilliant live rock/blues album. This studio album of many of the same tracks unfortunately does not come close. A good guitarist regardless, but this album lacks the skill or excitement and occasionally ventures into the vulgar."
1,"Vulgar, distasteful, dumb","There's no doubt that Popa Chubby has a fair amount of talent, but ""Booty & The Beast"" suffers from guitar hero stylings and a lack of taste. The CD is just like Chubby's live shows-brash, outlandish, and just short of the type of thing that could give New York City a bad name in the blues forever. Avoid at all costs."
5,One of the most interesting books about women of the Hebrew Bible,"I have read a few dozen such books and I was very impressed by this one. Tikva Frymer-Kensky is very scholarly she often defers to the original Hebrew. Her work is well documented, yet very readable. I was particularly impressed by her treatment of Hagar. Most Jewish authors either portray her negatively or ignore her altogether."
3,"Very Informative, But a Little Boring","The author provides a very scholarly analysis of women in the Old Testament. If more intellectual reading is not your thing, then this may not be the book for you. However, if you are into writing that is a little more dense, then you might like it. She provides a lot of interesting points. If you want to read about some of the symbolism and meaning of women in the bible, this book could pose very helpful."
2,Good messege--Poorly conveyed,"While the messege and concepts presented in this book are valuable, the author spends far too much time in some narcissistic attempt to tell her life story--over and over and over again! It takes nearly 40 pages to get to the meat of the book. I nearly gave up. Frankly, this book could have (indeed, should have!) been cut in editing by 1/2 to 2/3. I did learn alot from the author's research. It is quite unfortunate that she wasted space and the reader's time with noninformative verbosity."
1,It is a bunch of pscho babble nonesense,Fat and Furious is nothing but a bunch of pscho babble nonesense. Hollis contributes binge eating to a dysfunctional relationship with your mother. Overeating and compulsive eating are complex issues and should not be attributed to any one conclusion. What about those that are fat that never even had a relationship with their mother? It seems to me that the author thought the theory sounded realistic and continued to elaborate on it without any real proof to support it. The book did not help me one bit. I'm sorry I wasted my money.
4,No problems,Works great just like a polarizer should. Really brings out the clouds and darkens the sky. Purchased for use with the Sony A77 and 18-250mm lens.
2,Unorganized Book,"Examples are cluttered, confusing, and book is not very organized. Book could use more simple examples similar to homework problems. More in-depth explanation of ideas."
1,Just use one time and then broken,"We bought it a year ago to use for our kitchen drian clog. We just used once after bought it. A year later, we brought it out for second time use. It broke and could use again. It's not a good product. too much plastic parts there and make it fragile."
3,"There is too many unanswered ""?"" in the storyline :(","""Close to Leo"" should have been titled ""Close to Marcel"". Then the title would have had more to do with the story. Marcel is the youngest of four brothers. The oldest one, Leo, finds out that he has AIDS.And in that moment appears very first ""?"" in that storyline. Is it really AIDS or HIV? Leo is 21. It is hard to believe that AIDS managed to develop to such degree that he will die.I tried to understand the reasons behind Leo's actions, but I just wasn't able. There is too many unclear parts in this story. Why did he visit his ex-boyfriend? Why did he throw away the pills? Why didn't he want to start the treatment? And so on.Instead of focusing on Leo's plot, the director decides to set his magnifying glass on the youngest Marcel...Which is not bad, but didn't help the viewer understand the choices that are made by Leo.The film is well played, for sure. But the storyline didn't meet my expectations."
1,MOST WERE BROKE (LIKE 80%). BUY DIRECT FROM SPANGLER NEXT TIME :(,"WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED. RECEIVED CANDY CANES AND ABOUT 80% WERE BROKEN. NOT JUST BROKEN BUT EACH CANE WAS IN SEVERAL PIECES. CAN'T USE THE 80% FOR OUR CHURCH CHRISTMAS PROGRAM HAND OUT SO I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT TO DO WITH THEM BESIDES PUT INTO COOKIES OR SOMETHING. ANYWAYS, WILL BUY DIRECT FROM SPANGLER NEXT TIME. IN THE PAST THEIR PACKAGING INSURED ABOUT 10% WASTE. THANKS ANYWAY, THAT'S WHAT YOU GET FOR TRYING TO SAVE 20 DOLLARS."
1,No longer made in USA,Read the description carefully. Made by Spangler - Made in Mexico.I almost was fooled. Spangler used to be made in USAGuess Mexico is better than China. CVS candy canes are made in China.
5,"Astonishing, deep.","Recently I purchased Glow's ""Rain Theory"" and ""The Years."" The only word that comes to mind in describing ""Rain Theory"" is astonishing. Glow's beautiful voice combines flawlessly with delightfully simple synthesized instrumentals to provide song after song of deep musical sensations. Many of the songs on ""Rain Theory"" feature lyrics focused on lost love. At first glance (or listen) someone might think the music here is to be gloomy or moody, but this is not so. The CD's dominant body of work seems to focus intently on themes of pain and healing such that the songs, to me, celebrate human resilience and passage beyond life challenges.My own musical tastes vary considerably - from disco and classic 80's to contemporary rap and happy hardcore - and I am very happy to make room on my CD rack for Glow's fantastic musical mastery. I encourage everyone to give Glow a listen and be prepared to reawaken your emotions."
4,Allez cuisine!,"Yeah, I'm one of those Iron Chef fanatics. Glued to the TV when it's on, and a little out there in my own kitchen when it's not.As such, this is a great book. No spoilers in the episode listings (though sometimes I almost wish there were. . .), a few utterly random recipes, and some great background information and musings from Hattori, Fukui-san, and (duh) all seven of the Iron Chefs. Through it all, the culture gap seems to shine through in the translation, but if it didn't, I don't think it would work out right.A great companion piece to a show that is utterly addictive and just as wild as Chairman Kaga's outfits."
3,its fair.... not what i expected,"I kept waiting for the book to have the drama of the show. Maybe the problem was my expectations... I found alot of the book had info all ready available (on the net...from the shows)and some new information but it didnt seem to have the back-stage gossip-y type info i was hoping for... the bios were interesting and there was info i didnt know but alot of the book was decidedly uninspired. I would read this book, but frankly..i would borrow it from a library insead of buying it."
2,IRON CHEF NEEDS IRON EDITOR,"It was with great anticipation that I opened the box containing IRON CHEF, the Official Book. Unfortunately, in the hour it took to get through the book, I became more and more disappointed.The writing style left much to be desired, but I didn't expect a lterary marvel; the recipes left much to be desired, but I didn't expect a cook book.What I did expect was some semblance of accuracy - even in the made up world of ""Chairman"" Kaga's Gourmet Academy. For example, if memory serves me correctly, I viewed the four programs with the Ota faction versus Morimoto. In the last Ota faction versus Morimoto battle, the faction FINALLY wins. Unfortunately, in the book we are told just the opposite. In another example, there was a section devoted to Yukio Hattori. The section was highly informative, but Hattori-san's photos were to be found in the section devoted to Asako Kishi.The book is somewhat like ""Chairman"" Kaga - bright colors but little substance."
4,Nice to have for those of us who are Iron Chef fans,"Iron Chef is one of those things that you either get or you don't. My brother first told me about the show and I watched it and couldn't really follow what it was about. I kept wondering, ""what the heck is an Iron Chef?""But the show had me and I kept me coming back. Slowly I became hooked and started planning my Friday nights to see the show! Even though I know the new shows in the fall will be shows OLDER than the ones we have already seen, we fans will be glued to them throughout the year.This book is a nice backgrounder for the show. It is carefully done to NOT give too much away. After all, they want us to watch the show. And there could be more on each chef to my taste, and there are a couple of errors here and there. But finding them is half the fun!If you are or would like to be an Iron Chef fan (cult member? nut?) this is a good book to feed that appetite."
3,Ummm...is that it?,"First of all, I do like this book, but there's just not enough to it. It's a ncie, quick sketch of the best show on television. And that's the trouble, it's just a sketch. There should be more recipes, more photos and - most importantly - more of Chairman Kaga. That said, it's still a good little book and no Iron Chef fan should be without it."
4,Allez Cuisine...?,"This book is really, a very good book. It is translated straight from the Japanese version, and includes a lot of important things in it, but as a die-hard Iron Chef fan, I'd like to see more.The interviews (one on each chef) and statistics are good, but I'd like to see more of those. I'd like information on a lot of the battles besides just who competes and what the theme is. I'd like to know who won each as well as highlights and commentary on a lot of the important battles. I'd also like more of an in-depth timeline as well as details on a lot of the intricate rules for basic and special matches.Overall though, this book is very good. It gives a lot about the background of the show, but not as much on the events that took place.Finally, I'd like an index in this. It'd make finding a challenge or theme ingredient a lot easier."
4,"Well researched, detailed biography","Overall, this was a good biography of Augustus. The author clearly resarched the subject thoroughly. The book does a very good job of portraying Augustus, his personality, and those closest to him. In some ways, the book is almost too focused on Augustus, without adequate attention to the background of Roman society. While the author does address background factors, these sometimes seem to get lost in the very detailed focus on Augustus himself. This book would probably be most enjoyed by those looking for a fairly academic approach, and those who have read other books on Augustus. Despite some of my misgivings, I still recommend this book. I enjoyed it, and learned from it."
4,Great travelogue capturing the 'season',Very readable account of the striper fishing frenzy in the fall at the tip of LI. As a (former) windsurfer I could relate to the pilgrimages you make to the right places at the right times to take part in your passion. Combine this with someone who knows what's important in life and knows how to write--and you've got a good book.
4,Too small print for soft cover.,Great story and read. Kaminasky describes situations in nature so well that only a fly rodder would understand. that Someone should clearly state that the print size and text is extremely small for the soft cover. I woulod have bought the hardcopy for the $10 more.
3,The Guides don't control Mother Nature,"I enjoyed the book and the concept, but the fawning treatment of certain guides (that probably gave Kaminisky free rides) read too much like promotional materials."
3,Needed modification,"I bought this item for my 1978 Chevrolet G20 van's back door lock. Evidently, the back door lock is not the same as the front door locks, as this item wasn't a direct drop-in replacement.Being too lazy to return it, I simply modified the existing lock bracket-arm (the part that actuates the locking latch) with a Dremel to fit the new lock. Unfortunately, the new lock is in the always-locked position (meaning that you must insert the key and turn to unlock and open the door, but you must return the key to the locked position to get the key out) but it's not a big deal for me.As for the item otherwise, it has fine build quality and all the parts you need to replace the FRONT door locks."
5,For A Friend,"The Dark Shadows dvd's are for a friend, she likes the series instead of order bootleg copies I decided to look for decent copies. Yhank you."
1,Item far from new as advertised! D. S. # 14,"I finally reached watching Dark Shadows # 14 (there are 1250 shows) and the inner part is not only a cheap replacment, but it's broken! The ""postcard"" is also not present! This is a first. This DVD was advertized as ""new"". Needless to say, I'm unhappy!"
4,Haunting story with good supporting characters,"Christmas is definitely not merry for Richard Jury, who is a man without family and home at the start of this book. He meets a lonely, beautiful woman in a graveyard at the beginning, but a day later she is dead ahd he is left holding questions instead and trying to tie together the pieces of the woman's life, which seem oddly unfinished.Along the way, he meets up with Melrose Plant, Agatha, and Vivian, on a Christmas visit at a stately home with a rather conventional cast of odd upperclass guests and hangers-on.This is a novel that is strong on atmosphere and interesting side characters--the crumbling pensioners in the equally disintegrating seaside resort are especially powerful. The plot, which deals with changelings, sometimes seems contrived, but ends up havng its own power."
1,A hatchet job,"This is unfortunately one of the few books on the subject in English, as it is a dreadful hatchet job, a venomous, mean-spirited attack on Vittorio Emmanuele III and the other members of the Italian royal family. The author stoops so low that he might as well crawl. It is out of print, but copies linger in libraries, ready to poison the minds of the unwary."
4,It is good for kids 3-4 years old,"Those funny glasses are good for small children. If they desire to play with. I thought that will fit me, but no way for adults."
4,"jazz without ""quotation marks""","So often in today's lackluster music industry, the normal output from an established, successful contemporary jazz artist like Chris Botti would be tired and predictable. But, this is not one of those albums. ""Night Sessions"" is fresh, powerful and catchy without drifting too far into pop shlock and predictability. The songs like ""Lisa"" and ""When I See You"" start off in one place sonicly and elegantly end up in another. My favorite track is ""Best Time,"" a moody, contemplative song this is both ambient and funky. This album is smartly produced, well-priced and really belongs in your collection"
4,Good CD,I like this cd..It is very mellow and easy. Almost a little too much.. As i said a very good cd but not nearly as good as When I fall In Love
2,night sessions to sleep to,"I bought this record for the Sting song, which is very good. What a DULL DULL DULL the rest of this record is. It's about as exciting as a bowl of oatmeal just not as hot. Unless you're a Sting completist, a must to avoid"
4,"Chris Botti ""Night Sessions""",Chris is a talented musician and this CD shows his talents well.It is mellow and pleasing to hear. I am enjoying it very much
1,Avoid at all costs...,"ADV Films is trying to make this sound like something new, but it isn't. It's merely the first 5 episodes of the Darkstalkers American cartoon which is ALREADY available on their Out of the Shadows package. In fact, inside the packaging is the VERY SAME Volume 1 DVD from Out of the Shadows. The cartoon is worth less than crap anyways. Look at my review of the first Darkstalkers cartoon DVD to get details on exactly how bad this thing is, and why I want to plug a certain kid named Harry Grimoire right through his thick head."
3,They'll let ANYONE create a listing on Amazon nowadays! LESLIE S WT LOSS? What? I don't even..??,"This listing is for Leslie Sansone's Walk Away The Pounds Weight Loss Series 3 Pack, but you'd be hard-pressed to know that by reading the listing's title. I know this is supposed to be for reviewing the actual product, but there's no other obvious place to vent, other than writing to Amazon, and hoping they'll edit it. How lazy was the person who created this product detail page? They didn't even include the actual title, abbreviated important details for no reason whatsoever, and failed to include the titles, ""Walk Strong,"" ""Muscle Mile One,"" and ""30 Minute Walk."" The mind boggles."
5,Great bag with 2 separate pockets... however....,"The bag is heavy duty - as all Ultimate products are. The only drawback however, is I wish the bag were padded like the ""On-Stage"" bag is. However, the On-Stage bag has only one wide zippered pocket with a padded divider. I guess it's impossible to combine the two because I haven't been able to find one... but I own both bags and both are rugged and built to last."
1,Broke within 24 hours of use...,"It is a good laugh for about a day and then, eighteen the batteries die, or the penit self breaks on half. I don't recoment wasting your money on this, there are better thing out there Like the Liquid Ass which is only 1 or 2 more dollars to buy, I bought 4 because they can't break, and they smell so bad you will want to puke.Liquid Ass"
2,Cheap,"this toy is ok but its not durable at all the batteries die really fast, the shock doesn't hurt and it breaks easy! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY"
3,super fun.,"it works good for me, got a few people pretty good. but sadly starting to break but for now its working!"
4,Oh yeah-fun; now it's broken.,"Of course it's fun and funny to get an unsuspecting person to ""hey write your name with this pen"". It broke after getting dropped a few times. cheap contstruction but the price was right. I got my $3 worth of fun and more."
3,Fun and cheap but doesn't last,Mine lasted 2 days and then started to break and pieces started falling off. It's a good buy for how cheap it is but I really wish it was more sturdy.
1,tareable,I got it in the mail and opend it and it didnt work so I messed with it and I shocked myself and almost got it to work but just the whole set up is awful because when u pres the button it dosnt shock unless u pres it down the right way.there are many more problems with this product but I dont know how to explain them but what ever u do DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT.
1,broke on reciept,Item was broke on receiving it . GARBAGE! and it's very difficult to return Item don't waste your time or money.
4,Great !,"I was very pleased with this product, my son just turned 3 and we bought this in a package with other CD's and this one is his favorite, he can move around the activities by himself, he really likes the matching and puzzles. There are only a few activities and I think he may get bored after a while but it was still worth the money spent."
2,NOT a simulator game..disappointing,I bought this game in hopes that it would be fun like real RC racing...alas it was not to be. the car control isnt bad but the behind the car view doesnt work for me. I'm surprised that Team Losi approved this junky game for license..Save your money and get a game like NFS or Gran turismo...
4,bosch sawzall blades,"good saw blades, a little course for the metal I cut though, so not as smooth as a finer tooth blade."
4,Under-Recorded Singer,"Ghulam Hassan Shagan is in great voice, as always, but advanced in age (72 at the time of recording); unfortunately, his technique has deteriorated. It is unfortunate if recordings like this were not made in his prime.Shabir Hussain's tabla is never overdone. The vilambits are never accelerated, but Shaurast has a ten-minute drut, not advertised on the cover, which is the least successful item. Sajjad Ali (2nd tabliya) goes overboard here, with even unusually much bayan ""melodics"", and Ghulam Hassan Shagan at this stage in his career is obviously a better vilambit than drut singer. (Surprisingly, he reaches some very high notes.) These exaggerations are carried over into Puriya Dhanashree; Ghulam Hassan Shagan produces some extremely out-of-tune gamaka, which, although hardly good classical singing, in fact add genuinely haunting, beautiful effect."
5,GREAT!,"I enjoyed this CD, as well as my family. Great selection, beautifully performed. I like her style.I highly recommend this selection."
5,"The best, most simple book of how to Love","This book is amazing. I use it every day as part of my morning prayer and meditation time, and will continue to do so for many years to come. It is a simple, straight forward way to remind yourself every day how to Love without Judgement.I just ordered 10 copies for Christmas presents."
4,St. Francis of Assisi,"Portrait of the Master is a story based on St. Francis' journey to Syria, accompanied by Brother Leo. James Twyman uses the Prayer of St Francis as the device to present this fictionalized version of a true event. Chapters three through fifteen are each titled with a line from the prayer: ""Lord, make me an instrument of your peace,"" ""Where there is hatred, let me bring love,"" etc.Brother Leo is sometimes confused and questioning; Francis answers him with patience and insight. ""Prayer is the act of being conscious of the breath of God...."" As this journey progresses, the message of each line is explained through example, careful explanation and with love. They eventually reach Syria and meet the Sultan, who has the power of life or death over them. Read the story to find out what happens to Francis, Leo and the Sultan.I bought this book from Amazon, and found that it helped me when I meditated. Perhaps you will find something in this lovely tale to inspire you."
2,"Good Subject, But The Writing Needs Improvement","Let me start by saying that I believe that psychedelics can aid in the expansion of consciousness when used correctly. Let me also admit that I did not, could not finish this book. It was written in as dry a language as I have encountered (and considering I am an engineer who has to read extremely dry technical manuals, this is not an observation to be taken lightly).I dont know if Mr. Merkur is unable to write well or, as I suspect, he feels that by assuming this dry removed tone his work will seem more scienitic and objective. In either case, his presentation falls short. He makes some good points, if only one can stay awake long enough to read them. It seems ironic that anything written like this should feature the words ""ecstatic"" and ""imagination"" on the cover.-Thomas Seay"
2,The bolts are very cheap grade 1 bolts,"The bolts that come with this kit are grade 1. They cannot handle more torque than 25 ft.lbs. Therefore it is important to wait until the RTV silicon (that you will put in between the gasket and the cover surface and in between the gasket and the differential surface) settles before torque is applied on the bolts.Other than the bolts, this makes the differential on the F150 look nice and shiny!!! Trans-dapt customer service is good in case you run into issues, however, they cannot change the quality of the bolts."
5,Really Beautifull!,If you like mantras and Hindu culture you will love this cd.It's very good if you need moments of peace and meditation.
5,I play this album several times everyday,It is like Deva Premal is making love thru her music. Perfect.
3,Sweet chanting,"Bought this on a friend's recommendation. It's pretty, but doesn't resonate with my heart as much as some of Jai Uttal and Krishna Das's chanting. She has a wonderful voice, perhaps what I'd like less of is the sweet background music. I liken it to listening to Patsy Cline - an incredible voice, with no need for all the orchestration behind her voice. Would like to hear Deva Premal sing with only the harmonium and/or some tabla."
2,Dakshina,Another disappointing CD. Deva Premal had one great great CD and that was THE ESSENCE. She needs to recapture the spirit of spirituality again in her next CD as she really has lost it in her two recent CDs.
3,Too Syrupy,"There is no escaping Deva Premal when you are looking for meditation/yoga music by a female artist, so I keep giving it a try. Many people call her voice ""angelic,"" but I just don't agree. I would call it ""syrupy."" There is too much trying to sound sweet, there is that vibration in the voice which I never hear in other kirtan songs, and the background music is just too much elevator music. All of Deva Premal's albums are like American Idol style kirtan, it may work well in spas, but I wouldn't consider it to be spiritual music."
5,Pure Beauty,"I was sceptical at first but it definitely grows on me after each listening. Brahma-Nandam, in particular, in pure beauty. I noticed this album was dedicated to the Osho, with whom Deva has been in touch since she was eleven (!). Strange coincidence, I ordered some of his books before knowing that..."
4,Powerful and bleak.,This book is a must for an upsetting and deeplook into the Intifada. The authors are unsparingin the details and deeply perceptive in the social framework that lead to the revolt.
5,A Voice of Experience,"This book by Bob Saile is a must-have component of any serious angler's library -- a study in honesty, accuracy, and carefully-thought anecdotes from a master. Unlike some fly-fishing writers who seem wrapped up in attitude, or demonstrating what and how much they know (that you don't) Saile's focus in on the essence of this sport, the people, the places, the traditions. His stories are unassuming, yet enlightening. Living in the Rockies, and having fished the places he writes about, with many of the characters he describes, I can tell you that his words are dead-center. You will realize (in a subtle manner) that Saile has literally seen and done more between the riverbanks than most of us could hope to experience. As a writer, and an angler, Saile is the master technician ... the real deal."
3,"Average book, unless highly interested in Colorado fishing.","Bob Saile takes us on a journey through Colorado with a fly rod in hand, and trout in mind. As a long time sports writer, he definitely knows what he is talking about here, but unfortunately, he is not a great writer. The content isn't particulary groundbreaking, and the writing is perhaps best described as ordinary, newspaper coloum style. Some of the more philosophical reflections in the book, are overly simplistic and somewhat unfounded. It does not offer insight nor does it challenge the reader, it simply conveys the (often boring and unfounded) opinions of the author. In all fairness, it is by no means a bad book, and Saile definitely has his moments where the reader will find himself chuckling. It is worth reading, but do not mistake it for a milestone of fly fishing literature."
3,Maybe I am missing something,"This is an interesting product but really not much to it. You see the earth move but no political or physical information. I have an Ambient Art DVD of Impressionistic Paintings that I like much better and a Starscape which is also very nice.But maybe there is a menu that I have missed. I just purchased a big world map so I will roll it out and put the DVD on my widescreen and see if I can match up things.Bottom line, good idea but needs more content."
4,"Dominique Moceanu's REAL life story, read this to KNOW Domi","Dominique Moceanuis a very talented gymnast and this book tells us how she started off and where. From breaking her coaches heart by leaving for Bela to having her heart broken by Bela leaving. This book is very well written, what we expect from Krista Quiner."
5,want to know what Dominique's life is really like?,"This is an awesome book for Dominique fans.Not only does it tell you very personal details but it also has good pictures(black and white) and it even tells you magazine articles that she appeared in. Some things mentioned in this book are- scores from the past,how her dad made her do conditoning at home, what her family is like,places she has trained other than Karoly's and it also describes her as a ""people pleaser&quot"
1,Sloooooow delivery,Ordered this book for my daughter for a school project. We had to change subject of paper due to delay. Paid for express delivery but it took over two weeks to deliver it! And sender was in my same state!!!!!
5,"A great book, interesting and heart warming","The book was fully detailed and was a very easy to read book. I read it in a matter of hours, and I am 11 years old. I love gymnastics and Dominique. Since the first time I saw her on T.V. I wanted to be just like her. Now I am taking acrobatics at a great little studio. even though we only do floor excersises, I still someday would like to be just like Dominique! The book has really encouraged me too succeed, and I really hope that anyone that wants to be something, jumps on it, you only live once!"
3,OK but there are better books out there to help with learning Spanish,"Voces y Vistas (Scott Foresman Spanish Program Bk 1) is OK but there are better books out there to help with learning Spanish.But it was cheap and my son was required to have it - I will sell it to the next freshman that will be required to have it though so ""no harm, no foul.""crjp64"
5,One of the best books I have ever read.,"I read this book a few years ago, after purchasing it from a second hand paperback bookseller. I liked Herman Wouk, but I found this book to be outstanding. I can understand what another reviewer was saying, when he said that he felt like he was the only person who had ever read this book. I liked the characters and really felt for them and their struggles. I was sorry when and how the book ended. My purpose in writing today is to see if anyone has knowledge of the movie, which starred Paul Newman, made I think in the 1960's. It is not on video, but I would like to know if any of the cable channels possibly have purchased it. If anyone has any information, I would appreciate him/her passing it on to me. Thanks."
5,Six Readings over 30 years,"I own a dog-eared copy of Youngblood Hawke and have re-read it many times. It is in my top ten all time favorite novels. What I have not read in these reviews, and what you may not know is that Youngblood Hawke parallels the life of the great Thomas Wolfe. Wouk denies it but if you've read biographies of Wolfe (I have read several), you will clearly see the similarities; far too many to be coincidental. Wolfe, southern writer, writes from his life, affair with an older married woman, tragedy, etc. I don't mind a bit; it makes the book even more valued.When you're finished with the reading, don't discard the book; in a couple of years you'll want to read it again, such is the richness of the story as well as the writing."
1,Youngblood Hawke,I found Youngblood Hawke very boring and uninteresting. I have not tried to read his other books yet but I hope they are more interesting.
3,I'm the only person on earth who has read this.,"This would not be on my top ten list of books to be stranded on an island with. Not that this implies the book is bad. It's just not very good. And, hey, nobody is around to argue the point. Which effectively makes me the authority on this book. Too...too much power. Head pounding, heart racing. I'll keep it direct: if you like sex, death, and tv-movie tone then this is the book for you, baby! Herman Wouk, you genius! Mediocre, lengthy, and ridiculously by-the-numbers. I feel like I would have to explain myself if I gave it any less then 3 stars. So 3 stars it is."
1,Not a happy camper,"I have to admit I was attracted to this Boom Box because of thegreat price for the features you get...but 60 days after purchasing it the CD player went capootz on me and now I have to try to find a dealer in my area or a Sony manufacturer to fix the problem. Something tells me that ""great price"" won't be so great after I get a quote to have it repaired. Watch out!"
5,A real cliff hanger -- This is what mystery novels should be,"""Bones"" is a novel that no lover of good mysteries wants to miss. Before we know whether or not the author can construct a grammatical sentence we are a captive to suspense. Wow! Who done it? I must add that some deep insights into the lives of tenured professors and their aspiring graduate students is a real bonus. Lovers of mysteries should say a little prayer that we hear more from this talented first time author. Wonderful read!"
2,not so great,"I was hoping to get a water bottle that was leak proof and would not sweat. I got neither. It is pretty , but that is about it."
3,It's cute,"The bottle it cute but have to be careful with the lid, it breaks easy and no replacement is available"
2,Leaky,"I needed a water bottle I could keep in my bag during school. This is not it. The insulation is not great, my ice melts by lunch. And unless my bag is upright everything gets wet."
3,"Good, but Could Be Better",This book is a little helpful when trying to figure out what something in a dream means. It's cool to see the background for something but it doesn't always necessarily help. The dream symbol dictionary doesn't have enough symbols and I often am finding that the things I am dreaming of aren't in there.
2,disappointed,"I must agree with the other reveiwers who felt that it took the joy out of creating...I too found this book stifles creativity...the cover art is beautifull,the illustrations of journals inside are okay---but it is far too wordy to me...all this writing of intentions bogs one down and inhibits creative process..I am an artist,therapist and use arts in my practice..."
3,Disappointed,"My problem with this book lies in it's lack of color. When presenting a ""course"" in visual journaling the authors should have either shown no examples (which would not be my preference) or have presented the examples in the full colors with which they were created. Visually this book left me not only ""blah"" but wondering why the authors would tout the creative benefits of this insightful VISUAL method while literally taking away from the beauty of visual journaling by eliminating color. The text itself is okay and the authors method of walking the journalist through the process of visual journaling was interesting. However, I did not find it ""good enough"" when coupled with the lack of color to warrant a a purchase."
2,Not much substance here,"As an arts therapist and professional counselor, I was disappointed in the content of this book. Visual journals have been used for decades by art therapists and a lot has been written on their worth as a tool for healing body, mind, and spirit. While there are some good suggestions in this book, it falls short in terms of depth and substance. Also, the people I work with-- mostly cancer patients-- found the authors' comments about cancer and other illnesses insulting. Yes, imagery may help to improve a sense of well-being, but this book implies that people control their health and can do so through visual journals. The authors are too simplistic in their claims and as a professional I cannot recommend a book that makes such claims to people in search of help and healing."
3,Not as functional as I hoped,I got this device to be used as an address book and birthday reminder. It just doesn't fit the bill. The screen does not have enough lines to view the entire address and no designated place to mark a birthday. Worth a try for the price but I would not recommend this product for this use.
5,Gotta Love Carman,"This so far is my favorite game that I have to play in school. I haven't found carman yet but I'm working on it. Unfourtunaty, you LEARN something! But it also gives it a good excuse for someone to buy it for you. I definatly give 5 stars to this game. I also thank the creater for inventing the game."
1,So slow.,This software was so slow to load on my Dell laptop that my son never even tried to play this game. I love the game (from previous versions) but this version was pretty much unplayable.
1,ugh,I was really looking forward to playing this throwback game but when I got it I realized that you can't play it on a new MAC. Big disappointment. It's useless sitting on my shelf.
5,Need I say more?,"I absolutely love this game, so does my best friend. Last Friday was the first day I tried it. I thought I solved a case but, the lady said I needed a warrant, what's that? But besides that I'm so excited to play that game until it's my group's turn!! I plan to get it but who knows, maybe I get the computer game or the gamecube one. No matter what, I think this game is a blast. I recommend this ages 9-12. But be careful when you solve your case, you have to solve it before your fuel or gas runs out!!This game is for kids that likes mystery, adventure, and wants to learn. Now I say those kids are smart!"
1,Useless game,"I love the games Where in the USA is Carmen Sandiego and Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego but I won't play them anymore and I certainly wouldn't recommend anyone buy them because their video capabilities have not been upgraded. They still only work at 640 x 280, 256 colors, when the whole world has gone past that standard. To use these games on a modern machine you have to keep switching your display colors back and forth. I don't know about anyone else but I find that an imposition. I am not a mechanical genius and I don't like touching things on my machine that I don't need to touch since I usually forget what I have done and then wonder why nothing else works."
1,Don't use on any new MAC!,"Hello! beware, this does not work on my 2 year old Mac. (snow leopard 10.6) Is it so difficult to post the system requirements online?!"
2,Won't play on my Windows 7 or Window's XP computer,"I have tried this on both of my computers. One is Windows XP and the other one is Windows 7. The windows 7 one is on my laptop computer and it opens the game but it keeps freezing and a message pops up with ""debug"" option on it every time I play. One my Windows XP one it installs but it won't open no matter what I do. I do not know if I would buy from this company again after all the trouble I have had with this."
1,Doesn't work in Windows 7,Haven't been able to get it to work for the kids since it won't install. If you have an XP machine it probably will work just fine. If yours is newer you may be out of luck. Luckily it didn't cost much so it's not a big deal.
1,Where in the USA is Carmen Sandiego?,"loved this game as a kid but, cant even play this will not work at all on windows 7, which realy sucked, i donated it to my local elementry school. it does work ok on the older comps."
1,Doesn't work,It wouldnt' work with anything I tried. I need to track down an ancient computer just to see if it actually works. It would load but not run when I used XP.
1,Not for Windows Vista,"I enjoyed this game in the 1990s, so I was excited to find it. It installs but will not play on Windows Vista. I also purchased Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego. It is not like the old version, and I was disappointed with the game."
2,Dud,Couldn't get this loaded properly so never have been able to play. No instructions for downloading or for playing..
5,A plumbers other best friend,"Tremendous piece of machinery, I love it!!! I had my first one for 10 years, it didn't breaksomeone wanted it more than I did I guess. After losing my first one I went searching andstarted to research all the 1/2 drills I could put my hands on, after trying several friendsand fellow contractors drills I am right back at the Hole Hawg. Well worth the price,while Milwaukee may have let their standards slip in other areas I believe they have left well enough alone with this guaranteed winner. This tool can power a 3 1/2"" feeder bit through 3~ 2x6s like it was nothing. I use it for all my major drilling projects, I do not bother breaking my right angle drill out for most jobs now. I recommend it to anyone who has to do any prolonged drilling."
2,A lot of the same,"I'm sure this book is great for some people, not me. I don't care for the over and over stories of patients and their issues. I prefer a plain and simple explanation of things rather than the drama of personal stories. So, if your preference is to read it and move on, this probably isn't for you. If you like the personal stories, this would be suitable."
3,A good read for women raised in an alcoholic's home.,"Book arrived quickly and was in condition as promised. In general, the book isn't really helpful to me, as I find it focuses on women who were raised by alcoholic parents and that is not my situation. However, there were points in it that I found insightful and gave me reason to think and consider."
5,Insightful,"When this book first came out I read it and it opened my eyes. I then went into private and group therapy for about 4months and then just group therapy for being an adult child of an alcoholic. It was something I wished I had done earlier. The cost of therapy after my covrage changed and new responsibilites ended my therapy after around 7 months. I had a great therapist. The author really explains the dynamics of how our relationships develop very well. I've read both of her books. In the second one "" Letter's from Women Who Love Too Much"" ( it also includes letters from men)she points out how peer therapy seems the most effective form of therapy for such issues. She had stopped doing private therapy at that point. A worthwhile book."
4,A therapist in a book!,"My therapist recommened this book and what a great find. Coming from an abusive alcoholic family, and until I read this book didnt realize I was one of these women. It points stuff out that make you realize your not alone and your actions are for good reason. It did have a lot of Personal Accounts and stories, but all in all, its a great book."
5,Life-changing!,"Holy moly, this book is incredible! Thank you, Robin, for writing this. The book described me so well it was shocking. By this time in my life, I can see that I am repeating patterns in bad relationships, but this book helped me to understand WHY I have been doing this since I was a teenager and what I can do to stop. Note for LGBT folks: I am a lesbian, but I had no trouble seeing the similarities between the heterosexual relationships portrayed in the book and the long term relationships I've had with women. The dynamics are nearly identical."
2,This did not work for me,I bought this book but I do not think it fit my situation. It fits certain cases but certainly not mine. And I am not in denial. I am trying to help myself overcome a painful relationship but this did not help me any. It may help someone else.
5,This book has been around for awhile but it still applies today,"The copyright of this book is 1985. I wasn't sure how it would apply to today's living. I am 51 and bought the book because someone told me about it. I wasn't sure that I was a woman who ""loved too much"" but wanted to see for myself. This book is an eye opener. I see how I live every day as a woman who loves too much and how I am making myself unhappy every day. I love the book but it hurts a little to see what I'm doing to myself."
5,wonderful book,"this book was a wonderful read, helped me realize i wasnt the only one in that type of situation. i highly recommend it."
5,GREAT BOOK!!!,This book has been SO helpful!!!It is easy to read and well written. I would recomment this to anyone!!!! Iam looking into more books by this author
5,Must read,This book helped me to understand more about what I need to work on to have a healthy relationship. I highly recommend it to anyone who thinks that they've given their all and then some in a relationship that did not work out. Chin up!
5,Gave me great understanding about myself,This book really helped me to understand why I feel and think the way I do. It has given me direction on how to heal myself and take control of my life. I think any woman that was raised in a dysfunctional family will benefit greatly by reading this book.
5,Two Thumbs Up for this one,"This book saved my life. I was finally able to not only identify what my ""problem"" was, but what I needed to do to make necessary changes in my life. I did also have to seek Codependant group meetings, but this is the book that started it, and propelled me on my way to recovery. Two thumbs up!"
5,A classic for men and women,"Norwood offers uncommon insight into why people develop unhealthy thinking and behavior patterns within relationships. Equally interesting are the stories of people who may alternately develop intense and unhealthy attachments to food, sex, alcohol, work, shopping, or any other external ""thing"" as a way to relieve deep emotional pain. If that sounds like you or someone you know, it's likely you will find comfort in this book. Solid guidance and concrete steps for those who are ready to move beyond these behaviors to a more healthy way of life - or support someone else who makes such a choice."
4,Answers many questions,"I will give to others who may want to look into their relationships before things go to far. I wish I had known this before my first wedding, but did get help and have a very happy 33 year marriage now."
3,Not Just for Love Addicts,"Although I am not addicted to love or relationships, I found this book interesting and enlightening in the sense that it highlights different types of unhealthy relationships."
5,EVERYONE NEEDS THIS BOOK,GREAT BOOK! IT HELPED ME THROUGH A BAD RELATIONSHIP AND SHOWED ME THINGS I WAS DOING THAT I DIDNT EVEN NOTICE.
4,Eye Opening,This is an eye opening book. The personal stories in this book can apply to many women to one degree or another. Most women I know have fallen into a relationship at one point in time that is similar to the situtations described in this book. It offers insight into why this happens and allows females to look within themselves for the answers. Worth the read.
5,"Women Who Love Too Much, Like I Did","This is a wonderful book that shows you patterns, many of them based from childhood where abuse, neglect, and pain carry over into our adult life to get the love we didn't have much of when we were younger, so we love too much to get that love in our adult life.It's a book that helps you understand more about you, at least this is what it did for me, and how the patterns we have, have to be changed if we want to receive the love we really want. It does come from loving our self as much as we want that love to come from another person. I really suggest this book for helping you to see the patterns. Along with this book that I really recommend that has been a life saver to me is ""Stop Being the String Along"" by Barbara Rose. I feel that both books will help you to see so much, how to love yourself and how to turn it all around so that you receive as much as you deserve. Outstanding, even life changing books!"
1,"Advice good but...""case histories"" in book are fiction","This book was good in its approach to women and men who give too much and get little in return in relationships. However, it is extremely important to remember that Robin Norwood, the author, later admitted that the various case histories presented in the book are really herself (see Backlash, The War Against American Women, by Susan Faludi). It is good that this book has helped so many people, but I think it is wise to be honest in self-help books like this one, because one of the goals of this book is to enable you to be more honest with yourself, and what you want in your relationships."
4,Transformers G1 season 2 volume 2,"It is great to see all the old stuff back what I used to watch with the banners 'the transformers will be back after these messages', great to see and hear the voice that goes with it.Much errors are fixed but some still remain and you will spot them better than back in the days but it is a great set with extra's and nice art work.If you like transformers G1 and want the old series without the Rhino mistakes and know that not all episodes are digitally restored and therefore don't have picture quality as Rhino but still used the original 35mm tapes (as much as they could) this is worth ordering knowing this set comes as close to the series they broadcasted."
2,Don't recommend,"If you already know some basic Italian, perhaps this would be a helpful refresher. For a beginner, it's difficult to coordinate the tape with the text, they don't track one another directly. One would suspect that their respective preparers didn't talk much once they got started on this project. I regret buying this material."
3,Classic Ash for the newcomer - 2.5 stars here,"OK, a real concise run through is offered here for anyone wanting a primer of the early era Wishbone Ash output. This covers the band from their debut Wishbone Ash to 1976's New England and included ranting sleeve notes by John Peel that may make you feel the guy was a bit unhinged. And yet cool at the same time.the tunes here are from the Ashs' early, long track era. They are fairly indicative of the albums they are from. While not a great album this is probably a great way for a newcomer to explore these guys. Or for the fan of hteir later stuff, such as Raw to the Bone, who want to open a window to their more formative days."
5,The Black Cat is Pleasantly Eerie and Strangely Satisfying,"An almost cryptic tale about an alcoholic who goes mad and attacks his cat, the start of several horrid events that happen in this short story. What makes this tale the more creepier; Poe himself was an alcoholic."
3,"""These events ... have destroyed me...""",A bad end well-deserved... but - the Tell-Tale Heart builds itself more soundly and looks deeper in the mind of the man/murderer. Here is a man who simply states he's lost his sense of humor for the world - and his companion black cat is is punching bag and victim. It's sudden replacement - his growing madness and anger - and the next unfortunate victim - all add up to nothing surprising and certainly far less than the opening lines invite you to imagine.
3,a mistake in my order,"I intended to order a new product but somehow a used one was shipped. I take responsibility for it, even though I don't understand how it happened. That was disappointing indeed because it was a gift for someone else."
4,must read,"The South Asian lesbian/gay/bisexual/transgender movement has come a long way since 1993, but Ratti's book is still a primary source of information on the subject and hence a milestone for the movement. The chapters are highly variable in quality but are all eminently readable. Readers are strongly urged to check out www.trikone.org and the khush listserv to see where the desi queer movement is heading these days."
1,Like drinking out of a fire hose!,"I'm looking for a book to use as a text for individuals who have worked extensively with Dreamweaver but have minimal, if any, programming experience. It would seem this book was meant to address this audience with its overview of OOP. So, I was rather shocked when the author covered Inheritance, Namespaces, Directives, the Forms Code Model, Event Handlers, Postback, Viewstate and Inline Render Blocks in eight pages then with no further discussion, went on to show, as a first example, a Dropdownlist and a Calendar control. The reader is asked to follow along by typing in such code as ""Calendar1.WeekendDayStyle.BackColor = System.Drawing.Color.FromName(sender.SelectedItem.Value)"" with absolutely no explanation, no discussion of the properties and methods of either of these controls. Nothing."
1,Waste time...Waste money...Worst book I ever read,"Imagine when you do your school report on the last night before the deadline. This book touch many interesting topics but only for fooling the buyers. Like I said, like a student write a paper for the professor. Like just cut and paste from other sources. Give me big headache."
2,You'll want to inspect this one in a book store,"I saw this book at Borders and I was not too impressed. But hey, that was me and you might be different. This is not a comment about the book as much as I don't feel that ASP.NET is best done in DreamWeaver and DreamWeaver doesn't have the best support for ASP.NET so I usually stick to VS unless the pages don't require server side code."
2,A toy,"I borrowed one from a friend to set a line around a addition in preparation for siding. In a 35' run I was off 7/8. The laser was fine, the level bubble was off! Wasted an hour trying to figure out what was going on. This tool is good forwell I don't realy know"
4,Oxford Dictionary of Zoology,"`The Oxford Dictionary of Zoology' as it's name suggests is a dictionary of zoological terms and words. In a basic format it covers a great deal from Aardvark to Zymogenous and it also has a few (and I do a mean a few) diagrams to illustrate more complex entries more clearly. This isn't a glossy, all colour book about zoology, but rather a simple, functional book to be used by zoological students or dedicated amateur naturalists. This also has various chapters at the back covering Endangered Animals, The Universal Genetic Code, Geologic Time-Scale and SI units. This is a clear, well referenced dictionary that should be immensely valuable to students, but of minimal interest to those who have only a passing interest in wildlife or zoology. For these people I would recommend DK's excellent book called `Animal' which is large, glossy, beautifully illustrated and comprehensive.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
3,Lots of text,"I was hoping for more charts and illustrations.More for the professional than the hobbyist. Still, it has the vocabulary if you are reading difficult texts."
2,Need a master's degree to understand,"I got this book for a class and it was the professor's first time teaching. He couldn't help us much so we were forced to learn from this book on our own. It was almost impossible for us(about 5 students) to learn from this book. I ended up buying LaMarsh's ""Introduction to nuclear reactor theory"". It was the same info and much easier to understand."
5,Great service.,Everything went right and smooth with my order. I got the book on Amazon way cheaper than in a library... Good value!
4,Great History Review of Recent History,"This book was a great synopsis of recent history. It covered everything from the A-bomb to women's lib. It's only drawback is that the focus is political... I think the book might have benefited from some more information regarding social history. I read it as part of a US History class, but would recommend it to anyone for personal reading as well."
2,As a E-Book it leaves alot to be desired,"I HAD to get this book for my Embry-Riddle 309 class, thought the E book was the way to go, because in the past most of my E Book textbooks have been great. This one is terrible, You can't copy (copy and paste) anything out of the book i.e. to create separate notes. This class requires a lot of formulas, tables etc and you have to keep flipping back and forth and of course the E Book page numbers never match up with the textbooks. Maybe for a different purpose it ""might"" be a good book but for this specfic class I would recommend shelling out a few more bucks and getting the hard copy."
4,"Thought provoking, engaging etc...","This slim volume is well-described in the editorial reviews; I feel no need to repeat that information. The strength of this novel is in its power to force reflection - on the nature of art (music in general, the role of the musician/conductor in particular), the relationship of human passion to art, and the relationship between man and woman. The first switch in stories, from that of the conductor to the ice age lovers, leaves the reader momentarily baffled. At the first return to the contemporary story, however, the interrelationships become clear. Thereafter, the structure of the novel seems natural. At the novel's end, the reader is left with many unanswered questions which in this case leads to a desire to reread, picking up interrelationships not noticed in the first reading.This is not a ""perfect"" book but it is well worth your time."
5,Lyrical Celebration Of Music and Love From Fuentes,"Carlos Fuentes has written a brief, poetic elegy to love and classical music in his latest novel, ""Inez"". It deftly weaves together two simple tales: one a tempestuous love affair spanning decades between Mexican diva Inez Rosenzweig and the famous European conductor Gabriel Atlan-Ferrara, that briefly mirrors the political chaos of the last half of the 20th Century; the other, the love affair of two Paleolithic Europeans somewhere along the coast of Ice Age Europe, tens of thousands of years ago. This terse tale is among the finest examples of recently published literary prose that I've come across."
4,Fuentes' excellence at the culmination,"Fuentes achieves in less than novel length what most writers fail to achieve in a lifetime of unending novels. A lifetime of pursuing a single lover and only in old age understanding what loving that individual means. Inez (Ee-ness) consolidates the apogee of the author's writing excellence in an easy, quick-paced read about star-fated love never quite coming to fruition."
4,No so good sound but for the price it is acceptable.,"Pros:The distance range is as seen in the product description.Very light weight.Battery life is long lasting, between charges.It is confortable to my ears, for long periods.Cons:The LED flashing on broadcasting unit, generate noise on the receiver.Has a very low background noise.The equipment is not so quite for others in he same room, it could be more isolated, outwards."
2,don't waste your money,"Thes headphones produce a very mediocre sound quality when they are working well, which is only part of the time. The sound breaks ups horribly with any volume, the headphones themselves produce annoying physical noise, and slight motion can cause them to drift off wildly. They are junk."
2,Great Product - Horrible Durability,"When these headphones are working, they are great. I never have trouble receiving sound. They are amazingly comfortable. Great battery life, and batteries are rechargeable. Long distance is great too, I can walk throughout the whole house on multiple floors without any trouble.But... it's FAR to often that these are NOT working. As a matter of fact I've gone through FOUR pair in the last 2 years. The first pair didn't work out of the box. The second pair lasted two weeks and then the headset just would not turn on. The third pair lasted about eight months before the same thing happened, they just would not turn on. The forth pair lasted about a year and then yesterday the very same thing happened."
1,Acoustic Research 900MHz Wireless Sterio Headphones AW771,I bought this wireless headphone AW771 in Dec. 03 at Circuit City. The first one was defective - On/OFF switch would not turn on the headphone. I exchanged a new one next day I bought it. It worked for 2 month. Then the on/off switch broke again. Now I could not turn on the headphone. Acoustic Research web site (WWW.Acoustic-Research.com) did not exit. I am not pleased this product at all.
2,"They work OK, but they are too big and unstable on your head","They work just fine. But they are too big and unstable on your head. After a while they feel uncomfortable and you can't walk around with them on because they fit so loose they will fall off. Acoustic Research definitely got the electronics right, now if they would get a handle on the ergonomics this would be a great product."
4,"Great Sound, subject to interference","These have the best sound of any of the wireless phones I've used. Good bass especially. The only drawback is that 900MHz is a crowded spectrum, lots of interference from phones, computers, frs radios, etc. One other problem is that the earcup swivels are weak and tend to break. After getting warranteed replacement for two of them I just epoxied the cups to the overhead hoop. No more problem."
2,2 Weeks,"My pair lasted 2 weeks. I found the headphones a little difficult to setup. Not technically difficult, but it seemed like a lot of unnesessary work (there are two volume levels, three if you include the reciever or PC you are plugged into). My pair eventually died and were unable to connect to the base. I also found that the headphones were not as comfortable as other ones I've owned."
2,Some issues,"I got these headphones for Christmas and found that they have a couple problems...First there is a noticeable hiss that can get annoying unless your source is loud. ex. explosions, heavy metal rock music, etcSecond the volume seems to change, not a lot just a enough to become annoyingThird the range isn't nearly described as what the box says.Overall I am not happy them BUT they seem to function well enough to use and not return."
3,Not Bad For The Price!!!,"I own a few pairs of wireless headphones. All of them are about the same. These are quite comfortable to wear. I actually like them better than my Sennheiser RS 45. Which I paid a lot more money for!!! They don't cut out near as much as my Sennheiser's. Also they seem to play through walls pretty good. They are a bit annoying to set in the charger but, once you get used to them it's not a problem. Overall, they aren't bad for the price!!!"
1,AR Wireless Headphones,Pretty disappointing - the tone quality is good but the headphones are so directionally sensitive that the reception ogoes in and out constantly! I'm going to fiddle with it some more this weekend but if I can I'll return it.
2,Very poor quality,"The 'phones started out OK, but had nowhere near the range they claim. I can get noisy signal while 10' from the transmitter. The antenna is much too directional. Over the last two weeks, the headphones got where they would not turn on, despite fully charged batteries. Problems also turning them off. I discovered if I happened to move the L headphone, the power and receiver went crazy, then off. Very poorly designed as far as the transmitter/receiver goes. As for the sound, I guess its OK. I received these as a gift this past Christmas, and contacted A/R about service. Nothing doing without a receipt, which I never had. I explained it was a gift, but nothing doing. I can say I'll not be purchasing any of their products in the future, and I'd advise staying away from this product. I'm 56 years old, so its not like I've abused them in any way. I just need the extra volume to listen to TV without blasting the neighbors or my wife out of the room."
1,Disgusted,"I just purchased this product on the 6th of May from Best Buy. Please save your money.. the headphone for mine was defective. The on and off button did not work and after finding out other people had similar problems.. I'm sure the customer dissatisfaction for this product is very high. I don't know why they make junk so expensive these days? I'd rather buy a cheap headphone that is reliable than one that doesn't work at all! My God, I wish we would boycott Acoustic Research!"
3,Something of a letdown..,"After reading some good reviews of this compilation from the Bristol crew...I was expecting a little more. Basically, the tracks aren't very consistent. The first disc gets off to a great start with Adam F's Brand New Funk, but then moves into some rather boring two-step and cyborg tracks (exceptions are the Ray Keith and Peshay tracks, although none of them match Brand New Funk for its sheer adrenaline factor). On the second disc, the Suv and Roni Size tracks stand out, and not much else...for more consistent compilations, check Grooverider's Prototype Years and any of the Metalheadz releases or V Classics."
4,Not for the weak.,"The CD opens with Adam F's 'Brand new funk'. I am not his biggest fan, but the one track is reason enough to buy this CD. It requires high volume and my neighbours have been complaining. There is plenty of other good stuff as well; a remix of 'warhead', the biggest tune of last year, and a superb track from Ed Rush and Optical. If I was forced to give a downside, it might be a touch monotonous. But yet very very good."
1,basically a waste of money,"Totally boring materials, my 3 kids weren't the least bit interested in any of it and frankly, even though I am learning German too, neither was I. The CD nearly put me to sleep. The picture dictionary is probably the best item included but it's got only a few words. We all read it together a couple of times, which takes only a few minutes. Thankfully, there is much better stuff out there that I've been able to find and they enjoy--live and learn I guess."
3,"Bah, humbug. Technology.",Darn SACDs. I'd like to get this recording but it won't play on my computer and I hardly ever use the CD player anymore. Furthermore I have no convenient way to get the SACD to a CD so I can listen to it on my computer.Bah.
4,Not bad at all,"I ordered this used from Amazon.com. It came at a relatively speedy pace and was in good condition. I was disappointed with some of the other songs on it. The only one I really liked was the Welcome to the Dollhouse Song, they have two remixes of it on the CD. I was able to listen to the entire song all the way through and it still an awesome song. Also included in this CD is the Anniversary song, done by Steve and the Candy song which Steve is singing when Dawn first encounters him. I didn't really recognize any of the other music."
5,Best tuba jazz out there,Hey I have to say this is a killer CD! I bought this CD and enjoy it greatly! If you want a good investment get this CD.
5,Laffit: All About Winning,An interesting look at one of the greatest jockeys of all time. I liked the interviews that gave insight into horse racing and Laffit Pincay's career. Highly recommend for fans both old and new
4,Full of strong insights,"This is a solid, commendable introduction to the strange personality and courtly world of Germany's last emperor. It has much to say about the physical and psychological deformities that may explain why Kaiser Wilhelm behaved as he did. It is also extremely revealing about the depths of his vicious anti-Semitism. The book makes good use of rarely mined source material and is written in a pleasingly forceful style that commands the reader's attention."
1,Not What I Expected,This video is not animated and is fully narrated. It is not at all what I was expected when I purchased it!
1,Don't bother.,"I was very dissapointed with this entire series of cartoons. The animation is bland, the jokes are just not funny (could be pulled off in the tv series and the movies but not these cartoons). Even the voices were whiney and annoying, except for Fester. True, they were created in the 70's, but Scooby Doo was funny - this isn't. Of course it is in the same style of Scooby Doo which makes it even worse, especially for an Addams Family fan - which I am. Not that I have anything against Scooby Doo. If you really need to try these cartoons out, try the Reluctant Astronauts I gave that one 2 stars."
4,awesome,"I believe the book definately makes the boys look good from every angle. It makes them look so good, that I had to reality check myself and remind myself that I can't have them. (Especially Justin and JC) The book tells you all the history of the band. I didn't know that they had so many hits in England before they even came to the US. I recommend the book for any *N SYNC fan!"
2,it was okay,When I first got this book I decided to take the nsync quiz in the back first well i thought i got all them right(which i did) but the answers were wrong. I think 3 of the ansers were wrong.
3,Pretty good for an unauthorized book,"Tearin' Up the Charts is okay. It's kinda short because I finished reading it in one day. The whole book is basically a bunch of quotes from 'N Sync put together as a chapter book. Most of the information is basic stuff telling about what they did before the group, how they got started, info on each of the guys, and what they how been doing this year. Some of the interesting stuff was the chapter that summarized each of the songs. There is also a 50-point quiz which is pretty easy because I got 47 out of 50 before reading the whole book. Overall if you really want to learn about 'N Sync you might as well buy the official book. After all it was written by them."
3,Great Book if you dont read the magazines!,This books information is straight from tabloids. So most of it I already new because I follow the group. There arent too many photos either about 6.
2,pirated copy?,The music is perfect but there are no liner notes. Who is playing what instrument? The reason to buy a CD as opposed to individual tracks on itunes is to get the text that accompanies the music. There is nothing accompaning this CD and it looks like an illegal copy.
1,This is so ...!,"DON`T YOU DARE BUY THIS GAME! If you're looking for a real game buy Smackown 2. This game has dumb controls, 2 easy levels, and one freaky graphic display! I don`t have a clue why reviewers like this game!"
3,"Not So Good, But Not So Bad.","I like the race levels, but some boss levels are too hard to figureout. It's kind of a 50-50 sort of game."
3,Well very peculiar. Buy Spyro 2.,I rented this game and found it very boring. Good thing I didn't buy it.
1,Doesn't work,I really hoped this would work but it didn't. I tried to mill different types of mushy food and all it did was stir it around. I guess it would make an OK small and hard to clean strainer.
4,Good&Funky,Weapon Of Choice is a cross between Fishbone&Cameo with a Parliament Influence there.They Have Grooves&real Instruments.it's a Shame they won't get the Airplay. Props they Deserve.This is on the real.
4,fans of funk won't be disappointed,"I am just a silly white boy from the suburbs but I know old school funk when I hear it. Lonnie and the rest of the nutts serve up the goods in the tradition of P-funk, but even wackier! The lyrics can be hard to follow for the uninitiated but if you try you WILL catch on. Bottom line, this a booty shakin' party platter with enough going on lyrically to keep one busy just listening."
5,"A ""MUST OWN"" for anyone into ""good"" music & Funk","Saw Weapon about 5 times while living in ""Simi of the Valley"". It became a necessity. It's too bad they broke up. Saw the record release party with ""Trulio Disgracious"" (members of Fishbone)--unbelieveable. Their first album is great, too, but this is the one to own. Long live MEGANUT!"
5,An excellent introduction to Tamilian vegetarian cooking,"I can't recommend this book highly enough. If you followthe recipes carefully, they come out just likemy mother and grandmother's. Another useful feature is thatwestern terms for the ingredients have been provided."
3,Books for the price of gold!,"Can someone tell me why this book is priced at $100 plus dollars?!I paid $18,95 for it!No other comments"
5,south kitchen star book,"I am Mahesh Sharma from New Delhi,INDIA,I read this book &certified that it is a complete book on South Indian Cookin.I am also a cooking writer & written a lot of books,study a numbers books,but this is wonderful.--mdswriter@yahoo.com"
4,Spices,"Philip E. Mann, co-author of Vegetarian Revenge -Toasting and grinding spices for Indian Cuisine is an essential step. Toasting spices in a small fry pan with a ittle added olive oil makes the spice flavors blossom as outlined in this book. Spice grinding is easy if you use a small manual grinder (nicer spicer) or a small electric mill, rather than a mortar and pestle. Spices should be ground just before use: a common sight in India is a woman freshly-grinding spices on a stone rectangle with a cylindrical stone implement. Try toasting and grinding spices as detailed in this book, for rewarding flavor"
2,"OK, but not great","Just a quick review after seeing the others up there. I got to say, I don't love this book. I find that often the recipes do not come out right - sauces are too soupy, the food is often too oily, and that masala dosa has NO spice to it. I ended up adding WAY more to just make it have taste. All in all I suggest getting 'The Spice Coast of India' instead. You will be limited to Keralite cooking (sorta) but at least everything will come out as planned. Belive me, it is really depressing to spend 25 hours on one recipe and have it not come out."
5,I'd give it 10 stars if I could!,"I'm a South Indian myself and a total gourmand... apart from the classic ""Cook & See"" series, this is the book that results in the most authentic taste and flavor-filled dishes!The Cook & See books are translated from Tamil and not very well at that... but the results speak for themselves.This book, on the other hand, is written in English with good instructions... about the spice level, I think it's perfect but then I grew up eating this stuff!So if you have a mild palate, I'd easily quarter the chiilies and lessen the spices a tad.So if you are looking for a well-written book with good illustrations, with authentic flavor, I'd recommend this one!"
2,"Lovely book; but, repetitive recipes",I was very excited for the book. Most recipes are fairly involved and require long cooking/prep times. It was highly disappointing that most of the recipes had the exact same tempering recipe with no adjustments for the type of dish or suggestions on substitutions or alternate temperings.
5,Great Book!!,"I have only tried a few recipes, just order some of the spices and ingredients on-line form an indian food store. I ordered my spices from IndianBlend.com. Fair prices and came as shown on the website. Both recepies were excellent. I can't wait to try more of them. The book is beautifully written and illistrated. I plan on buying more of these books to give to my friends and family that love Indian Food."
3,Okay movie--but seems plagiarized,"This movie's not bad--it's just that you can't help but feeling you've seen a lot of it before--in ""The Eye"" starring Angelica Lee--a much better movie with the same basic concept. There are differences--but the premise seems the same!As far as this movie goes--it's fairly interesting-though it's pretty obvious who the killer is if you're paying attention.The first half of this movie seems like ""The Eye""-the remaining half seems like a lifetime movie--if you like Lifetime movies-you'll probably like this!The basic plot--Ann Culver has a cornea transplant and now sees visions experienced by the departed donor--whose death was determined to be a suicide--though Ann's ""vision"" says otherwiseI wouldn't go out of my way to buy or rent this movie--but if it interests you--there are worse movies out there!"
1,Look who is the star,"Nicollete Sheridan is the star, that should tell you something right off. This is a poor, B-rate thriller about a woman who has visions of a murder after and eye transplant. Nothing here is special or scary and the acting is second rate"
3,Gee,"It took a while to get use to. The support was great, to great as a matter of fact. I started to get my headaches more often. After 2 weeks of sleeping on it I am going to pass it on to my daughter. The headache came more often and were becoming worse. I did notice that the pillow did not stay cool as previous stated."
3,Not as great as I hoped.,"It ok. It isn't very comfortable to sleep directly on though. It's not soft enough for a pillow. Also it's heavy, feels like a sack of grain, because it kind of is. It works well with a thin memory foam pillow on top though and thats how I use it."
4,Had high hopes,"I have been having problems finding a pillow, feel like Goldilocks and Bucky was highly recommended by a trusted source. I had such high hopes that the neck pain, night headaches would go away. I was told it takes some getting used to as well. It seems that I have to get the buckwheat just right in the pillow. I have tried so many pillows that I didn't mind trying one more. I will use it on and off. Seems like in the middle of the night I get up and swap out pillows either for Bucky or my old one."
5,"Get a great nights sleep,","Seriously, I was slightly skeptical when I purchased this pillow, but after night after night of lousy sleep and morning after morning of neck pain I decided to give this pillow a try. Massive change, I can't recommend this pillow more. The only thing I would recommend is perhaps purchasing a slightly larger version as this one is slightly too small to fit into a standard pillow case."
1,Nothing!,"After 1 1/2 bottles I notice exactly nothing, no benefit or detriment (except being a bit poorer). With chronic pain and nerve damage I look for any edge to cope and get to sleep at night, this isn't it. Based on some of the write ups I found on the internet about GABA, about how powerful it was, I was a bit hesitant to try it. Well, fear not, it's about as effective as taking a couple of M&M's before bed time."
3,Revisiting youth,"Saw this on a Kung Fu fest when I was about 12 years old, and thought it was an incredible display of Kung Fu skill, in a gritty world where gangs of Kung Fu masters contended to rule their territories.A revisit shows it hasn't aged TOO badly. Alexander Fu Sheng was a rising star in the chop-socky film world, a life ended too young. Would have been interesting to see where he could have gone with it, in ""Chinatown Kid"", he's a likable country bumpkin adrift in the big city.The transfer is terrible, source materials were likely hard to come by. The bonus trailers are hilarious."
1,From a Student of Fasching,"This book, in conjunction with the suggested movies (A Long Walk Home, Wall Street, etc), should be used in high school religion classes. Having had World Religions in high school, I expected to delve further into the Buddhism, Hinduism, Judaism, the Bhagavad Gita, etc. and instead learned no more than I already knew. If it comes as a surprise to you that world ethics can be traced to roots in religions, then maybe this book will be of use to you. If you understand the teachings of religions other than Christianity, seek a different title."
2,Great concept - but seriously flawed,"The outline of this book is a great concept - looking at ethics (expecially of violence) from the perspective of contemporary practioners from varied faiths. However, there are several very bad factual errors in explaining at least two religious concepts and the author's overall interpretive scheme is a little too overbearing.I wish someone would take this idea and develop it further."
3,It was OK,I had read other Harold Robbins books and this carries on in the same mode; uses sex to fill story gaps and the characters are not completely true to the originals in The Betsy.
2,The Sex-- The Se-- The S-- The Stallion,"I have read many of Robbins' books. Most were disgestible. This one isn't. The story line is thin as paper. In EVERY chapter, there is a sex scene, in some even more. And there are many chapters. If you know all the family members of the Hardeman dynasty -- each and everyone has sex with various other people. And Angelo Perino with most of them. I think 50% of all words is about sex, adultry, teen sex or intercourse. COM' ON!The Betsy was a book about building cars. This books is about sex. Oh and some people are involved in the car industry.This is something you see more often with establised writers. Once they're establised, they're writing down crap, just to fill the paper between the covers and make YOU buy the book.Fortunately I bought this book at a flea market (...)."
1,Waste of good paper,I didn't even bother giving this to the goodwill. It went right in the trash. Lucky it was a gift and I didn't waste my hard earned money!
1,Horrid,"Laura Schlessinger's awkward text and Dan McFeely's ugly illustrations make a book neither kids nor adults will find appealing. Children won't relate to language no kid would ever use (""I hate my life!"") or to the humorless, patronizing moral lesson. The best children's books are lovingly written by people who like and understand kids and want to entertain them. This object isn't really a book at all: it's another ""Dr. Laura"" promotional product. Reviewer ""zeh"" is right: you can do better."
2,Poorly constructed,"This is a nice-looking costume that I thought would be like other inflatable costumes I've seen on friends -- their costumes have been used over several years. My son put it on and within minutes we found the connection between the fan and the batteries didn't work properly. The costume would only partially inflate. After about 10 minutes, we tried to adjust the connection (like plugging in headphones to an iPod). It's just poorly made. I wouldn't buy this or anything from this company again."
5,Quick-Tie Is Right,"What I really love about these Glad Quick-Tie Tall Kitchen Bags is that the 4 flaps make quick work of tying up and disposing of these bags -- I really don't care for twist ties - or draw strings for that matter. Draw strings may be seemingly convenient, but the trouble is, they sometimes rip through the plastic sleeve, especially when you tug on them to heave a heavy bag out of a trash can.The flaps on the Glad Quick-Tie bags, on the other hand, hold up much better to heavy weights. Just tie the 2 opposing flaps to form two intersecting ""handles"". These two handles together will hold up to a lot of tugging and heaving. The bags themselves are very strong and will hold a lot of weight (These bags boast a ""3-ply strength"").---The Glad Quick-Tie Tall Kitchen Bags are not only strong, they are easy to tie up and dispose of. Highly recommended."
1,I don't like these bags,"My local store didn't have my regular handle-tie garbage bags, so I ended up buying these bags.I hate them. I'm just waiting for the day I run out of them to go back to my handle-tiebags. They're a pain to use. You have to tie them twice, and then carry them by the knotsyou made. Really, there's no good place to grab onto them to pick up the bag.Get the glad handle-tie kitchen bags instead. They are easy to tie and carry."
5,A masterpiece,"This book is by far the most comprehensive discussion of the structure of the world-economy from the world-systems perspective. Chase-Dunn builds his theory and analyses on the earlier works of Wallerstein, Arrighi and others but takes a critically important step by emphasizing the interactions of economic, political, and military power and how they impact the structure of the world-economy and reproduce certain structural constants of the modern world-system. With all due respect to the previous reviewer affiliated with a law school--this is directly a message for you--your are wrong and your historical analysis is completely faulted. Furthermore, your critiques illustrate either your lack of understanding the text or your ignorance of history."
2,RELUCTANT REVELATION,"This book fell short of affirming that Ken Wharfe was a real Diana insider. Its ""secret"" details are very scanty: contrary to the expectations its title aroused. Mr Wharfe refrained from revealing any ""close secret"" that is hitherto unknown.If you cherish reading anything about Lady Di, you may enjoy this one. But, if you are interested in some new revelations, I doubt if this book will quench your appetite.As is customary with our nature, Ken displayed a deep sympathy for the dead. He did his best in down-playing any of those embarrassing moments in Diana's life. Still, I would have liked to know the reason why the late Princess, who called attention to charity during her lifetime failed to include charitable donations in her will. Instead, she left her entire wealth for her sons, who are not only royal, but are already multi-millionaires.My inference is that the ""secrets"" in this book are so closely guarded that no reader will be able to come across them."
2,Very Few Secrets Divulged,"From the reviews this book has garnered so far, I was expecting much more. Ken Wharfe is one of many, many people coming out of the woodwork to tell of their time with Princess Diana. Any person you seen in the background of a photo of Diana has a story to tell. The thing is, Wharfe doesn't want to tell too much, so there's not much new here. There's a lot of self aggrandizement -- how Wharfe saved the day, this time and that time, how the ""most beautiful photos ever"" (in his opinion) were the result of his taking a island holiday situation in hand. And of course, how if HE had been still providing protection, she would not have died. The thing is, let's face it, Diana did not protect herself. SHE did not wear her seatbelt, SHE put her well-being in Dodi's unctuous hands and she herself, as Wharfe notes, was one to drive at speeds of up to 100 MPH.I think there's much more Wharfe has to say, and why not? We're all dying to know more about her."
2,It's disappointing...,"Contrary to the title, this book certainly doesn't reveal any extraordinary secrets. Furthermore, the author seems quite taken with his own self-importance. What is surprising is that there isn't a single reference to Paul Burrell, Diana's butler so recently in the headlines and whom she apparently called her ""rock."" So many people have written ""inside"" stories about Diana and one has to wonder who really were her confidants and who have simply been capitalizing on the employer/employee relationship. Mr. Wharfe, despite his altruistic assertions as to his reasons for writing, has obviously hoped to profit from time spent in her service."
2,CAUTION: Difficult Fitting Pull-On Boot,"These beautiful boots arrived today -- and I tried... and tried... and tried... to get my foot into it. The ankle area is VERY narrow, and the angle at which one would have to try to get past that narrow area into the actual ""foot"" of the boot is impossible. (Hey, I've had ballet and can point my toes pretty darned well!) It is a gorgeous boot - but it seems to me to be designed to be impossible to get into. Sadly, these boots are being returned."
1,Disappointed in this edition,I saw the PBS program on Mrs. Beeton and thought this book (or this version) would be an interesting compendium of Victoriana. It's actually a contemporary book and not very interesting. I've donated it to the library.
4,Fruit Strpe Gum,I searched for Fruit Stripe Gum.I found Fruit Stripe Gum.I ordered Fruit Stripe Gum.They shipped me Fruit Stripe Gum.And guess what? It tasted just like . . . FRUIT STRIPE GUM.It's awesome.
1,ID4: Independence Day,"I am giving the shipper a negative comment, I ordered this on this on March 28 and still haven't gotten this!"
1,Not even worthy of the bargain bin,"Ok, here's how it works...play level one and then tell all of your friends that you beat the entire game. No, really. If they ask you what happened in say, level 10, simply describe level 1. Why? ITS THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER AND OVER.I am so happy that I only rented this game. To be honest, its not even worthy of 1 star but you can't rate it any lower. I don't care how cheap the price is...DONT BUY IT."
3,Best Golf game out there!,My husband loves this game. I bought this game for him on our anniversary and the next day he bought me a plat/diam ring!
5,Brilliant,"This CD shows the capability of Mark Lawrence as compared to other popular trombonists, like Christian Lindberg and Joseph Alessi. Lawrence has the soloistic feel of Lindberg (which is my only complaint against Alessi), and can play convincingly in all the styles exhibited on this disc (which is one of Lindberg's problems). This is a must buy for all trombone enthusiasts!"
3,Don't use floresent bulb with this product!,Pros: This product works for me with incandescent bulbCon: The photo cell is not so accurate or sensitive. The description ofthe product on amazon doesn't state that you should not useflorescent bulb.
4,Valuable personal story,Much of the book deals with experiencing deafness and a cochlear implant. These portions I found interesting and informative. Other personal issues were much less interesting to me since they did not seem to illuminate the main point.
4,the adult experience of a cochlear implant,"This is an excellent book for an adult who is considering a cochlear implant. As a person who was implanted as an adult and successfuly used my implant for 21 plus years, I can tell you that Michael Chorost has done an excellent job describing what the adjustment process is for learning to hear through a cochlear implant. His personal story is compelling. And for anyone who really wants to know the technical aspects of how a cochlear implant works, this is also a very good read."
5,"artful writing, a true pleasure to read","I found 'Rebuilt' to be superbly written, with a wit and style that was enjoyable. Since my husband has had difficulty with his hearing all his life, I find the subject most interesting, but I was flabbergasted to read about the true intricasies of the human ear. The author brings the subject alive with modest prose, telling us about his life before and after his implant. I hightly recommend it."
4,BILLY VAUGHN'S GREATEST HITS!,"Almost all of the songs on this CD were originally hits by Billy Vaughn. Most of the arrangements are ""covers"" or ""copies"" of the original Billy Vaughn hit 45 arrangements.Orange Blossom special lacks the fervor and full orchestration of the original. This CD contains a great selection of songs and I too am sorry it is no longer available. However, the originals are available on ""the best of Billy Vaughn"" (an Australian import available here) and also on the German 2 cd collection ""the Best of Billy Vaughn 50 Greatest Hits"" which is also available at Amazon.com."
4,Why we need to pray,"Dutch sheets does an excellent job of answering the many question we have about the necessity of prayer. His explanation of why we need to pray if God is sovereign has really helped me in my own prayer life. I do feel that the anecdotes are a bit frequent, and some scripture doesn't seem to have the intention he proclaims, but this book is a must for the Christian who needs the impetus to pray without ceasing."
4,I had a hard time understanding intercessory prayer,It had it's moments. I liked the stories of how the prayer worked after so many years of normal prayer didn't.
4,Excellent book on Intercessory Prayer,"Recommend highly. You may find some issues you have questions about, but I encourage you to focus on what is clear and understandable. Author documents 99% of his statements with scripture. I wondered about a couple of areas and wasn't able to confirm them with scripture myself, but I learned volumes from the 99% I didn't need to wonder about. Also helps to read with an eye towards what the Bible actually teaches, rather than what I learned growing up in one particular church. Again, recommended."
5,The Best!,"Dutch Sheets book, ""Intercessory Prayer"" is a prayer resource worthy of many reads. It is full of thought provoking statements, and will encourage young and old prayer warriors alike. It is especially encouraging for those wanting to learn more about intercession. Sheet's really connects with the reader which makes the book an easy read.This book not only instructs, it helps the reader to apply it's contents and go deeper with God."
3,Difficult to follow,"I was interested in the 'how to' of intercessory prayer. Although the book gives some examples from the Authors point of view, it is difficult for me as a lay person to follow. I think it is perhaps the choice of words. In other words, it didn't really do much for me!"
5,Learn to intercede,"One of the most helpful books I've ever read on prayer, and I've read every book I could find on the subject for years. As I read this book, I began to realize that lack of knowledge was the reason some of my prayers had not been very effective. The Holy Spirit used this book to teach me about REAL PRAYER. My prayers are now much more focused and effective."
4,Excellent Guide to beginning an Intercessory Prayer Ministry,"Though I am not completely finished with this great book, it has provided a sound foundation for training the congregation in the ministry of Intercession. Pastor Sheets approaches the subject with clarity and from the beginning by thoroughly explaining what Intercessory Prayer is-this is key as many believers and non-believers alike have limited insight into the power of Intercession. I will be using this book for our church's fall Intercessory Prayer Ministry launch."
2,Distracting writing style,This book could have been written in half the space that Rev. Sheets devotes to it: there are too many anecdotes and jokes that draw more attention to the writer than to the subject of intercessory prayer. I didn't have the tolerance to finish it.
1,The biblical basis for this book is nonexistant.,"Sheets evidently knows something of prayer and has some insights into practices, but when he writes on theological issues, he strays from the biblical record."
1,NOPE.,"This isn't anything like the cloak from the movie. At all. It's a long and thin piece of black fabric that doesn't even come close to wrapping around my entire body, and I only weigh 130lbs. It comes with a little clasp thing to hold it around you, but you would seriously be better off just going to a fabric store, buying a piece of fabric, and cutting it with a pair of scissors to make a cloak.Huge waste of money!"
3,Not bad for a chick flick !,"I am not that much into chick flicks, but thought this one was pretty good.Yes, certain things where predictable and certain things pleasantly surprised me.I wasn't to keen about costume design, the cinematography, and the graphicsof the texting and stuff, otherwise I would have rated it a bit higher. But I work in film so I guessI look at it in a different way and also knowing how hard it is to make a film.I thought all the actors where fun to watch."
3,Doesn't work with Vista,"From what I can tell, seems to be fun makeover software. Unfortunately, I have Vista and it won't play correctly on my computer."
4,God Bless the Child,"Accompanied by a CD of Billie Holiday singing ""God Bless the Child"" the reader is given a visual interpretation of the proverb ""God blessed the child that's got his own,"" in which the illustrator has displayed the happenings of the Great Migration. Repeating the chorus of the song, we glimpse inside the lesson of making a way for yourself.""Mama may have,Papa may have,But God bless the childThat's got his own!That's got his own.""The illustrations capture the words in the story and serve as a tribute to our past as well as to those reading now who are committed to self-reliance and not only making do with what they have, but striving to become better. GOD BLESS THE CHILD is a wonderful book that I think children would enjoy, but more in a read-aloud atmosphere combined with the playing of the CD enclosed.Reviewed by Tee C. Royalof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"
2,Great Illustrations.,I really did not get a feel for this book. I really liked the illustrations that are in this book. If you are looking for some great illustrations this is a great book. This is a Coretta scott King award recipient book.
4,A very good story.,"Sam Dana returns to his home after a successful prospecting trip to find that his half brother Walt has let the co owned ranch run down and is into rustling and giving them a bad name, Sam with the help of Les Beecham is soon on the trail to getting these troubles ironed out, of course Sam gets the girl though maybe not the girl that it appeared that he would get. Its a little different story what with more or less 2 main characters. Highly recommended for all western fans."
4,Brother Against Brother,"This is the story of good and evil wrapped up in the lives of two brothers. One is determined to grow rich at all cost. The family name means nothing to him. The other is more concerned about clearing the family name than anything else. These brothers end up in a show down and the outcome is even better than expected. At 150 pages, the book is worth your time, especially if you are a fan of westerns."
2,"Informative, but...","This book is a well-written and informative overview of Qi Gong, but I was mainly interested in actually learning the exercises, and for that the book is not very useful. The instructions are sketchy, and the pictures show only the starting, ending, and one or two intermediate positions. For a flowing series of movements, it's really indispensable to have an accompanying DVD, otherwise you have to rely on too much guesswork. Some people may be comfortable with that, but for me, the descriptions and pictures leave far too many unanswered questions."
4,Qi Gong exercises,"I was very pleased with this purchase and would recommend the book! If people wish to be healthy, Qi Gong for Beginners will point you in that direction!"
5,Excellent book,"This is by far the best book that I have read on any life transforming physical exercise including other books on this subject, as well as books on yoga and tai chi. The author writes simply and masterfully. He promises an easy to learn, easy to do ""exercise"", and delivers. This book has none of the New Age psycho-babble that mucks up so many other books on the subject."
5,Excellent Basic Routine,I bought this book about a year ago after giving up trying to learn tai chi. I have never been good at mastering choreographed movements (such as a dance routine) and that is essentially what tai chi involves. This book presents a series of eight discrete exercises that are easy to learn (the instructions and photos are very clear) and enjoyable to perform. I've found that my energy level and flexibility have increased markedly since I made them part of my daily routine.
5,Simple and Effective,"Ancient philosphies are difficult to understand and master. They are vast and difficult to focus on the methods. This book gives the fundamentals and helps the reader/practitioner to focus and complete the ""exercise"". Whether it heals or not it will help live a healthy physical, mental and spiritual life! GIVE IT A TRY."
5,"Thank you, Dr. Wilson!","This is a fantastic book! Stanley Wilson put his heart and soul into it, as well as his tremendous knowledge. The instructions are perfectly clear, and his positive attitude is very catching. The qigong routine is great. I've been doing it twice a day! Stanley Wilson is a brilliant and compassionate man. I don't often try to talk people into reading a particular book; but this book is wonderful, and could do a lot of people a lot of good. It's helped me deal with my severe asthma, and I'm learning to stay calm and keep my breathing under gentle control during an attack. There are no mysteries in this book; it's all completely honest and clear. Did I mention that I really love it?"
4,"Good writers need editors, too","Chadz is a fresh voice with an ear for dialogue and pacing. But even budding Salingers need editors and proof readers. Too many typos and miscues in this one to rate Five Stars. Blame it on the publisher.Still, recommended reading for would-be, current and former Jarheads.S/F"
4,Shoot from the hip - straight 50's comedy- I LOVE IT!!,Great satire on today's politics. Love the humor and the music. The style takes me back to the 50's; which is very refreshing.
3,Helps?,It's winter and our poor old dog is so achy--they might be helping--you'd have to ask her to be sure! But she thinks they're yummy either way. :)
1,"Not ""SOFT"" ! Disappointed",These things are as soft as an old dried up tiny tootsie roll from last Halloween. I do not recommend this product.
5,From out of nowhere,"Placing this CD in your hifi is not a listening experience...it is an epiphany. From the moment those first jangling chords come crashing in you know this is going to be something special. This is Biffy Clyro's 4th release and it's amazing quite how far they've come from there original release the kids of pop. The title track itself is a glorious pop song with just a hint of meloncholly with it's ""I don't believe in anything"" chorus. The B side's while not quite on a parr with the title track do contain some interesting ideas and with it's sweeping melodies ""being gabriel"" could easily have been an A-side. In short, if you don't own this Cd you must have not heard Biffy Clyro yet, because if you had heard them you'd already own it."
2,I expected more.,"This book really disappointed my child and myself. I am not sure what age of the intended audience for this book was but the sentences were on the advanced level of an easy reader. I expect more from a Magic School Bus book.Magic School Bus books go into a very appropriate depth for a child. This book did not. It also painted a rosy picture of life in Ancient Egypt. I realize a kids book shouldn't be depressing but it shouldn't make it seem like the Ancient Egyptians had an easy life. The flooding of the Nile each year wasn't even mentioned. This flooding cycle had a great affect on the daily life of the Ancient Egyptians.All in all, if you would like a book on Ancient Egypt that shows your child a realistic portrayal of Ancient Egyptian life, this is NOT the book for you. This is a fictional story book."
3,Yippee Ki Yay! Again...,"This game is pretty good. The first one is better. The graphics have improved in this one and the story is fine but the game is just not as fun. Also, the controls are not as good as they were in the first one. The story is all about John McClane (of course) who gets asked by a good friend to come down to Vegas to visit his casino. Unfortunately for John, trouble follows him once again. Buy this game if you have played or own the first game."
2,The first one is much better,"Die Hard Trilogy (the original) is much better than this game. While the graphics are improved, the controls and camera angles are a HUGE problem in this game. This game is more of the same and doesn't really offer anything new. I recommend the first one or at least rent this before you buy."
3,"Enjoyable game, yet lacking some nice features","I was and still am a huge fan of the first Die Hard Trilogy game. The sequel, Viva Las Vegas, defintelly has some strong points, the story line moves along pretty well and the graphics are just a shade below that of DHT 1. What I really don't like and would have liked to see brought over from the first DHT game is some of the controls. I was a big fan of having the ability to duck and roll left or right to avoid getting shot at. Now it's just turn and run and hope that the enemies will miss you or that you shoot them first. Another feature that I think would still come in handy on the 3rd person levels was the ""radar"" screen to show where some of the enemies and walls where when you got lost. I know the making DHT 2 the same as DHT 1 would have been stupid, but some of the functions from the first game would have defintelly made the 2nd game that much more interactive and enjoyable."
3,ABOVE ALL,"Despite weak production efforts, this album made clear that David had the capacity to go on his own after Deep Purple. It has the bluesy feel all over it, it has master drummer Simon Phillips, along with Micky Moody, which would follow DAvid for a long period of time. I enjoy the album, even considering its flaws."
3,Definitely A Difficult Read,"To the last reviewer, it's all connected, and THAT is the point. It goes beyond the Kabalah. This text, if properly read, demonstrates the time immemorial TRUTHS upon which every moral system is based. The so-called different set of Truths that various religious systems quarrel over are different formats of the same, One And Only Truth. Freemasonry is based upon everything that imparts an understanding or all pathways to the Truth. Paganism and the occult were just earlier forms of man's search for the Truth. That's what this text is supposed to tell you. The chapters progress through man's search for Truth and end with monotheism."
2,"The Scottish Rite explained, but very difficult reading","Albert Pike was the first person to write a comprehensive review explaining the meaning of the various degrees of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry. He writes in a style that is esoteric and philosophic; this is not light reading. Each of the 29 degrees in the Scottish Rite are explained, interjeted with Pike's personal views of how they relate to modern (at the time) Masonry. Originally written in the 1800's, this book has survived to become a standard reference for all Scottish Rite Masons.There are other books that explain the Scottish Rite and are much easier to read, especially for a new Scottish Rite Mason."
3,death to the new world order!,"the style of writing and the use of grammar is not the issue with this book. it is the theology behind it that makes this work very dangerous to the masses that know nothing of true masonry. even most masons themselves have no idea and those that do know the lodge's true teachings are sworn to secrecy lest they be cut ear to ear. some of us remember the story of mr. morgan and the trajedy that fell upon this man after he came into the know of freemasonary and it's evils. i recommend this book to everyone so that they too can come to the realization that freemasonary is a religion, and it is also the root of satanic worship in the modern world. it has closely allied itself with new age teachings of mysticism and wants to take ignorant individuals down a path to the lake of fire to see thier lord lucifer first hand. to those masons i say... big brother is being watched."
3,TILL DEATH DO US PART,"With the opening of this psychological ""thriller"" by Andrew Klavan, you can pretty much figure out what's going to happen. Klavan is very reminiscent of Thomas H. Cook in this tale, but Cook has mastered the art much better. Cook doesn't give away his ending so early. There's a lot of merit in this book; Klavan's narrative skills are sharp, and there is much empathy for the character of Peter Blue. However, I found little empathy for Cal Bradley or his wife. Bradley seems immune to his surroundings and although he can help other people, he can't seem to help himself. To be married to Marie for so long and not realize what an emotional void she had, doesn't add much in the lines of credibility. By the time the book comes to its all too inevitable conclusion, I couldn't like Bradley or his wife very much. Peter Blue's fate is inevitable, but their lack of moral terpitude is unforgivable. RECOMMENDED ONLY FOR KLAVAN'S FANS."
5,A Deserved Five Stars!,"I've liked every Andrew Klavan novel I've read (try ""Animal Hour""), and this is no exception. It grabbed me and kept me turning pages to the end. I don't want to give anything away, but a psychologist has an unusual patient, whose dream sends the psychologist down a terrifying path, causing him to re-evaluate his seemingly perfect marriage. Read it. It's good.Animal Hour:The Animal Hour"
4,A scary trip into the pysche,"Psychiatrist Cal Bradley has an uxurious love for his wife Marie, a simple soul, good wife and mother, but not his equal in intelligence and education. He has been mildly aware that her past had some hidden secrets but was unwilling to dredge up the past in case it upset the comfortable present. Cal is treating a troubled teenager Peter Blue, who claims to have a mystical connection to God and whose crazy actions have brought him into trouble with the law. Peter threatens to suicide if put in jail so Cal is more lenient in his treatment of him. As a consequence, a brutal man from Marie's past becomes involved with them all, bringing down tragedy and violence which will forever alter the course of their lives."
4,"A Good Yarn, but....","It's probably just my personal problem with this book, but did religion need to play such a large roll in telling this story? And why was Klavan so heavy handed in describing just how Christ-like Peter was? Some times I felt like he was leading me along because he wasn't sure I could get where I needed to go on my own. Because of Peter's religious bent, we knew where we were going anyway, so I think he should have eased up on all the symbolism. Otherwise a fast, energizing read that I will recommend to friends."
1,"Mindless,,,,,,","Prententious, mind-numbing narrative. Klavan's other novels are so much better than this one. Luckily it was short. Un-luckily, it was also terrible."
5,The music of the ocean,"I bought this CD after hearing parts of it on a podcast from soundtract.net...It is an audio presentation of ocean life: listening, one can see the beauty of the ocean and it's wildlife. I highly recommend it."
3,"Caravaggio, as a cultural book","Good images, text as almost usually is addressed to people who have art into their interests, as a cultural event, but is not enough for painters who are looking at more specific qualities, techniques, materials, painting analysis from different points of view, etc.. Sorry, but I'm a painter, if you are not, I recommend it"
1,It has never arrived. Hard to review what doesn't come.,"Amazon completely dropped the ball on this. We ordered from a secondary supplier, and they haven't delivered it yet either, said it was in the mail. We think both of them promised a price they can't meet and both are trying to get out of the order. Amazon never billed, so it just dropped it. The secondary supplier says it hasn't arrived because of the post office and will try to find another copy or refund our payment. We still want the book and have asked them to send it. We'll see what happens. MCrenshaw"
5,A great study of the artist Caravaggio,the quality of the research and the color of the paintings are outstanding.Also the CD-ROM has an unbelievable amount of information on the artist'sworks and their provenance.Dr.John T. Spike's 20 years of research is shared with the reader and is so readable and engaging.
2,Good season,with stephanie and bobby john returning you wil have familiar faces. This is better than the previous season since both tribes win some and lose some instead of one tribe completely dominating. As a survivor fan this is a good season that should be watched.
2,Not Happy,I had to return this item for another cause it would freeze up and sometimes it wouldn't even load. When I got the replacement it did the smae thing. I returned it also for a replacement and again it did the same thing. So I returned it had got my money back. I really wanted this for my collection. But none of them would work right. But I still have to say Amazon was very good about the returns and the refund. I will continue to use them for other purchases
4,Survivor Guatemala,"Always enjoy watching a full season at my pace, and love the intrigue. Each season is different and unpredictable. Never know who is going to win."
2,Worst Battery Life,I like the design features and everything in this phone but the battery life. As the previous reviewer said battery drops dead by the end of the day even if use it for just few minuts only. But the specifications says 80 hrs stand by time. It is not even lasting 40 hours as standby(No calls at all) let alone 80 hours. Don't buy this unless you want to charge it daily. If the battery life is like this in new phone I wonder how it would be after 1 year use. I strongly recommend aganist buying this phone.
1,Nice Looking Piece Of Junk!,"This phone is awful, I upgraded because my i80 (?) an old nextel brick was just too big and it snapped in half. this phone is the smalles they make right now. It has horrible battery l;ife, I am on my second battery because it will just cut out without warning when I am on the phone and have barely used it after a full charge. the signal is terrible, I don't have reception in places that I did with my older phone. the case scratches and chips easily and it just doesn't work!! If I paid for the phone I would have given it up long ago, but I use it for work heavily, dc and phone - when the battery is charged it does work fine. Another annoying thing is the volume buttons on the outside of the phone are easily pressed if the phone is in your pocket and will take itself off of vibrate without you knowing.All nextel phones have horrible battery life, but some of them don't drop calls as much!"
2,I want my money back,"For looks it is a nice phone, for everyday use... Dont waste your money. Not good signal, terrible sound on the speaker and very delicate to most regular use. I used for a long time the i90c... I miss it even though it was a bigger phone. I would not recomend it."
1,Looks good but that's about it!,"I am on i836 number 2. My sister and I got these phones at the same time. The little metal cover and then the screen fell off the faceplate after a couple of months of usage. Then the buttons started failing (I'd have to press the end button 3-4 times before a call would actually disconnect). I could almost deal with the phone if the service worked consistently. Nextel service has become the biggest joke on the planet. And the products have got to pot as well. I had the insurance so I was (after much aruging, kicking and screaming) able to get a (new) replacement. Now, only a couple of months later, the SAME EXACT thing is happening again. My sister is experiencing weirdness where the display takes forever to get the foreground banner. I suspect its a circuit issue. If it wouldn't cost $200, Nextel would be eating my dust! Don't waste your time with this 'pretty' phone that is unless you don't plan to use it."
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON I836,"Do yourself a HUGE favor and DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY on this phone~! Trust me and you will be glad you did! I am looking for my 3rd phone and it will not be another i836 as the first 2 were!I have been a next el owner for 5 years and this is the WORST phone I HAVE EVER OWNED! It looks pretty YES it is sharp looking that made me want it! As a business woman I wanted something professional looking I slapped the flip down and the whole screen went blank, I though ok WELL maybe will take the battery out and try it, I took the battery door off and it broke! What did nextel do they made me buy another saying it could not be repaired! I thought ok well maybe I shut it to hard and gave it another shot, bought another and this battery door CAME broken. Ugggh a nightmare! After 4 months I DROPPED THE PHONE 1 TIME and the screen went out again. DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE! I have had phones that lasted a long time this one is a pretty piece of junk"
1,Horrible,"I had this phone for only a couple of months before the person on the other end could not hear me. The speaker phone sucks as well. I can only use this phone with a earpiece.Nice looking phone, horrible quality."
4,I like it,I have had this phone for awhile now and I love it. No problems with anything falling off or keys not working. Maybe some are harder on their phones than others. But I do know the only time I dont get a signal is when Im in wal-mart. But almost everyone I know doesnt and they have different phones and carriers.
1,"Beware of - free unlocked Motorola RAZR V3 instead!,",Do not attempt for this offer i.e (free unlocked Motorola RAZR V3 instead!). They will force you to buy things and will keep you in survey loops for ever. You will end up giving all your info and then getting out of it in frustration.
4,Has performed well,"Bought this stand last Christmas because our 7-foot Christmas trees tend to take up more water than our old-style metal stand could hold. The big round base makes it nice and stable; when it's standing on a piece of plastic to protect the carpet, the tree can be moved across the floor if needed by just towing it gently on the plastic. (Try that with one of those cheap metal stands with the four wobbly legs.) The big base does make it harder to cover with a conventional tree skirt as another reviewer noted.The three spikes in the bottom that anchor the tree are short but sharp--watch your fingers! Getting the tree in the stand and centering it hasn't taken long. The reservoir holds enough water to keep the tree well supplied, especially when it's just cut and taking up half a gallon a day, which goes a long way toward my enjoyment of the holidays."
4,Good little stand,"Worked like a charm. The spikes on the bottom add a lot of stability, and the depth of the water well was perfect for our several days out of town during the holiday. My only concern resembling a complaint would be that the height of the stand makes placing the tree skirt a little tricky - that's more of a tradeoff for the extra capacity for water, though."
3,Does an adequate job,"Does an adequate job and holds the tree upright. It took alot of painful adjustment to get the three to stand up straight, I imagine this is a problem with almost all tree holders though.One annoying part of it is that there are depressions going around the outer edge of the holder. These catch needles and the needles cant always be shaken out easily so you have to use water to clean them out when you are putting it away for storage. This is something that could have easily been fixed."
4,An absorbing and factual historical drama.,"Churchill's political story in the 1930s is rendered very well in this work. Robert Hardy as Churchill delivers an excellent performance. The dialogue, acting, and general ambience of this series are excellent. The sound quality on this DVD is questionable, specially Episode 1. Much of the dialogue seems muffled. Understanding Baldwin's mumble is quite a chore. However, after one adjusts to these shortcomings you are sure to get hooked.One caveat. You will have to turn up the volume to compensate for the accents.One can say with regards to Churchill that the ""man and the hour had met"". Churchill certainly was a major figure in saving Western civilization. Going through this series I could not but help noticing how privileged a life he led. The family estate, Checkers, was beautiful with servants galore."
2,20th century's greatest man,this is a a wonderful story about an incredibly great man.....ruined by poor sound quality.
5,Hardy Brings Winston to Life,"Robert Hardy is wonderful in the role of Winston Churchill. This rendition of Churchill's perceptive battle in the 30's to combat Hitler and awaken Britain from it's torpor is infinitely better than the recent HBO film ""The Gathering Storm"". The supporting cast is superb, particularly Peter Barkworth as Baldwin, Edward Woodward as the slippery Sam Hoare, Eric Portman as Chamberlain and Sian Phillips as Clemmy. It covers all of the major political controversies that Churchill was involved with, India, the abdication in addition to the battle over re-armament. A MUST buy."
3,They are good trashbags,"Needed trashbags in a pinch when I was in the process of moving and couldn't get to the store. So, I know I probably over paid, but when you need garbage bags you need garbage bags."
5,No One has reviewed this ?! Get your Funk on....,"I nearly wore my CD out, several years ago. ""Mad Sex"" is swingin', and this album makes you want to sing along (as if anyone could sing as well as Prince). ""Until U're in My Arms Again"" is a ballad; beautiful tune. ""When You Love Somebody"" is hip, and sticks in your head. This album creates a fun, frivolous mood. I own nearly all of Prince's albums, and I plan to own them all. I am genuinely surprised that this one has not been reviewed, yet. I will take time to review my collection, soon.""New Power Soul"" is a lively CD that may have you dancing around or tapping rhythms on household items or the dashboard. If you dig this one, step it up withThe Gold Experience; ""P control"" is worth gold. ;-)"
4,Genuine and Readable,"Having no idea what to expect from Susan Anderson's first book, I was captivated throughout. In her very simple and approachable writing style, she tells a personal story in a way that makes it relevant to the reader. While including great detail about events and personal beliefs, she manages to engage the reader regardless of their own experiences or beliefs. She seems genuinely non-judgmental in her pursuit of understanding. I look forward to more of her Psychic Medium tales and notes from her ongoing journey."
3,Definitely not her best,"I found Passion and Affect to be too dated and slightly strange to be enjoyable. Yes, I plugged through it because I had enjoyed Laurie Colwin's other books. I think several of the story endings are abrupt and the plots just a little strained. It wasn't much money to spend, but I would have rather read something more enjoyable."
5,Passion and Affect,"Laurie Colwin is a wonderful, quirky writer. Her characters are well-drawn and altogether fascinating. I highly recommend this book! I plan to get her other books, but with larger type than this one--teeny!"
3,Not for the beginner,"I was led to believe this was targeted for beginners, but that is not the case! The sheet music is fairly complex."
3,Beach reading for Art lovers and Italophiles,"If you are looking for another 'An Instance of the Fingerpost' you will have to look elsewhere. This was Mr. Pears' first novel and is much lighter in substance and tone. I actually read it before I read the 'Fingerpost', so I was not expecting the other book's depth. What I found was an amusing little book, where Art Historians are the most clever folks around, and where the action takes place in locales I remember from my study abroad.Given that it was a first novel, and that I have since read the author's BRILLIANT 'Fingerpost', I am looking forward to reading other books in the series."
4,Excellent debut for series,"Details sets this book apart. Although far from a magnum opus, Pears manages to flesh out three well thought out central characters in a short space of pages. Their quirks and flaws are what make them likable, and the story evolves nicely through various European cities. Solid history gives the story a backbone, and Pears is obviously at home in the art worlds infrastructure and personality types. An ironic plot twist to end the book was the cherry on top of this tasty book."
3,Definitely a fun read for a train or airplane ride,"This a highly entertaining, fun and easy read, particularly for a long journey. The setting is compelling. One can imagine the characters in some highly-rated TV series. There may not have been enough character development, and perhaps I expected a bit more erudition. However, on the whole I quite enjoyed it, and now look forward to reading other Pears."
4,"Well written, different from the usual, fun read.","Really enjoyed this book. Reminds me of ""Searching for Cezanne"", and some of the murder mysteries which take place in Venice. Great European flavor. Throughly enjoyable. When the other three come out in paperback, I'll be first in line."
3,Enjoyable. Looking forward to rest of series in paperback.,"Overall, an enjoyable read. I liked the three major protagonists: head of the Italian police ""Art Squad,"" Bottando; the young protege, Flavia; and the English Art History grad student who, I presume, will continue as the main character of the continuing ""Art History Mystery"" series. The plot moved along at a good pace with some intriguing twists and turns. In addition, the book provided some credibly informative peeks at art restoration; art forgery; the Raphael period; the art museum business; as well as a whiff of the pleasures of living in and loving the city of Rome."
2,Is it me,"I dont know what it is, but some how I really missed everything on this CD. I was lost and said it was over after the first song. But Maybe I am being to hard, seeing that I was told this was a hit! Some how it just came off as a miss to me. But I will try it again, who knows maybe I was just ready to hear something so good, that the next CD was on my mind."
3,too much shouting,"I have to admit, I haven't listened to this CD very often, I may not have even made it from beginning to end, yet. It's just too much shouting for me. In addition, every song sounds like the last one. Donnie's voice is reminiscent of Donnie Hathaway. The lyrics can be compared to a couple of Hathaway's songs and a couple of Marvin Gaye's songs. But when you have an entire CD devoted to ""what's goin' on?"" it gets boring."
5,I love this cd,"Donnie has outdone himself again. So politically charged, great voclas, great music, great message. Anyone who is a true soul music fan will love this one."
2,Slightly fresh slant on a standard B movie theme,"A typical B-rate movie that does show a few flashes of originality. Basically, a substitute teacher at the ""high school from Hell"" decides to take matters into his own hands. He ends up kidnapping a group of 7 of the worst students and locks them in steel cages in rural Texas. In the midst of nudity, deprivation and electric shock disipline, they finally accept that they must learn or die! The characters, although grossly exaggerated, are really despicable enough to make the mistreatment at the hands of their captor almost enjoyable. From Bob Sage in Las Vegas"
1,My husband didn't like this,1/2 of what is on Vol. 2 is what was on Vol. 1. Filled with advertisements and rambling talking by his producer. Disappointed. There was less advertisments on the tv show than on the tapes.
2,TOO concise,"Too concise to really offer much illumination. Very brief on the various Irish heroes (Parnell, O'Connell, etc.). In the face of centuries of British destruction in Ireland, the author is somehow anti-Irish. Not worth time or money."
1,Not received,I have not received this item yet or the rest of this parcel. I don't think I can review something I have not received.
2,YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR,FOUR MOVIES FOR LESS THAN $10.00.THESE ARE DOUBLE SIDED DVD'S.THE VIDEO IS VERY COMPRESSED AND THE SOUND IS NOT VERY GOOD.THEY WILL NOT UPGRADE TO 1080.BUT THEY WERE CHEAP!!
5,One is artistic perfection/ Two are great entertainment/ One is kinda cute,"The Upside of Anger makes this DVD worthwhile. Costner at his best and Joan Allen electrifying in her performance.Costner, Russo, & Johnson show us the World of Professional Golf and fun Cinematic Comedy at it's Best.Whitney with her voice and beauty and many standout supporting performances make this Soap Opera drama engrossing. What Woman wouldn't want Costner as her Bodyguard?Rumor is a Chick Flick. As such it was good for a giggle and more Costner."
1,Chronic power failure issues. Overheating.,"Beware the Toshiba Satellite. The battery and AC power system does not work properly. The AC jack often ""loses contact"" with battery allowing battery to drain while it is plugged in and should be charging. AC power fails frequently and if battery has also drained, computer will simply power down. Only way to bring it back up is to manipulate the AC plug in its jack and try to restore power to the unit. Sometimes this means only putting the plug halfway into the jack for me and putting a barrier around the machine so that nothing will cause it to wiggle even the slightest amount. Warranty repaired twice, Toshiba will not extend warranty or offer replacement. Warranty is almost over and problem will undoubtedly reoccur. Fan runs constantly and system overheats causing it to shut down or cause the dreaded ""... has encountered a problem and must close..."" error. Very unhappy with the customer support technicians at the toll-free number."
3,The short season,"There was a writers' strike during this season, so it's the shortest of the four. 17 episodes, where the others are around 21 each. No price break, though.Still, you have to get it. It's the debut of Miles Drentell, the Dark Lord of Mordor, where the shadows lie!"
4,Wait for the complete series,"Season 3 is already scheduled for release in May 2010, and chances are the final season will come out in time for Christmas. Do yourself a favor and wait for the complete series package. The price per season will likely be better, and winter will be a good season to sweep through the series. I borrowed season 1 from my local library, and probably enjoyed it more having paid the 'rental' price than I would have had I shelled out full price. Patience is your friend."
3,Cute but not worth the price!,"I bought this doll on sale for $20.00 and I still feel that that was a little pricey.As far as the looks of the doll it is wounderful but the pen and book are another story.First the book is not that well made and I am certain will not last.Secondly the pen has to be pressed hard to get it to work.The pen also has a button on it that must be pushed everytime you turn the page to start a new activity and you must also touch the pen to the strawberry that says start here.Too many steps to start a new activity,infact my daughters favorite part about this set is the tiny back pack that came with it to fit the doll.The activities in the book are not very educational either.They are simply music notes or naming a character,there is no real interaction or questions.A cute idea but not well thought out.In my opinion this doll is only worth about $10.00.I would not buy it unless you find it at that price or you will be disappointed."
1,Not worth the buy,My daughter loves Strawberry Shortcake. This interactive doll and book are uninteresting and do not work together very well. The book has to be on a flat surface and then still does not work well. The doll and book quickly became seperate toys and neither are played with very often.
1,Very Disappointed,"As with all the other reviews I was very Disappointed. The pen attached to the doll does not work with the book. The doll keeps repeating ""Will you play a song with me?"" My 4 year old daughter was very fustrated with the doll. The hardware is 1980's and is not what is shown on the box.I would not waste the money on this doll."
1,Amateur demagogue,"Arundhati Roy seems to have a problem with facts, but she does have a good command of demagoguery. Her ideas have been culled from various media sources, and she delivers recycled misinformation with flair. She spouts the typical anti-American mush; it's a laundry list of liberal complaints that you've heard over and over again. What's amazing is her stunning lack of original thought. Why read Democratic talking points when you can hear them on television every day? But if you're into America bashing, then she's the perfect America hater with foreign blood."
1,Didn't work,"Device didn't work from the beginning. First I got ""Unauthorized Charger"" message on the cellphone. Reformatting the device and upgrading the software finally got the phonebook from the cellphone loaded into the device, but then the desktop software couldn't find the device in the USB port although it said my model cellphone was now supported and ""My Computer"" confirmed it was properly connected. Tech support people told me to return it to seller. Seller replaced it, but new unit failed exactly the same way. Bug in software or missing files, I'm guessing. Manufacturer's tech support was particularly unhelpful."
4,Room for Improvement,"It does the job that it was created for. What more can you ask? It would be better if you could save an additional phone directory (assuming it is the same model phone) but it doesn't and so, a one-shot usage is acceptable. It's better than saving all the information manually."
3,"the ""Handle"" Concept is GREAT; but the Video is not so hot","First of all, ""swing the handle"" is a great concept. If you can learn that in the first video, it would worth a lot more than what you paid for the video. This will cure most of major swing problems out there - slice, hood, fat, and thin, etc.Second good idea from the video is the sand play. The ""tee in the sand"" concept will make you a good sand player.Some other ideas are not so hot, e.g. chipping. You DO NOT want to land the ball outside the green, as he suggested in the video.The biggest problem with this video -- it is too long. More editting work should be done to make the total time 2 hours, and try not to cover everything in golf (he probably he knows that he is not super at some aspects of golf playing). Adding them to the video just diverts viewers' attention away from his core concepts."
5,The best and most simple instruction for a great swing,The title says it all. Eddie makes it very simple just like everyone tells you it should be. Pay attention to the grip and the position of the handle at the address or set up. This is well worth your money.Brian
1,This Bad Extension cable,i bought 3 of this usb extensions and with most of the devices i have plug in i get usb is not recognize I wouldn't buy it again
5,Its A Cable and It Works,It is exactly as described. It works good & have not had any troubles with it.
1,Didn't work for me,Bought 4 of these to get the free shipping. Could not get them to work with web cameras.Tried two different cameras and two different cables with no success.Do not buy these if you intend to hook up a camera to them.I haven't tried any other usb device yet.Good luck.
1,Product not as advertised,"Be forewarned, this product is not 480Mbps as it states on the site. It is a 12Mbps USB extension. The technical details show it as 480Mbps which would indicate USB 2.0. 1-star for product review, but 5-stars as always to Amazon's customer service / return policy."
1,never recieved it,"amazon list this as in stock i placed order 10/21/ and used 2nd day shipping its 10/29 and just shipped, Amazon upgraded shipping to next day, big help when it takes a week and a half to get order"
1,Bad Recommendation from Amazon.com,This might have been a great cable if only it fit into the slot on the Canon i320 bubblejet printer I bought from Amazon.com. My objection is: why did Amazon.com recommend this cable when I purchased my printer? It's so misleading and totally betrayed my trust in Amazon.com. I waited the whole week till I have time on the weekend to unpack my packages and print some photos--now I'll have to go cable shopping instead!
5,Works like a charm !,This cable did exactly what it was supposed to do and was super easy to use - can't ask for more than that.
5,USB Extension Cable,I received my USB extension cable quick and it was just what I needed since my printer is on the opposite side of the desk from my computer. The price was so much better after looking around locally and comparing different web sites. I would difinitely do it again.
1,Not really Belkin,"Just ordered three of these cables. Their appearance is slightly different than the Belkin product, and there is no labeling or package. Tried all 3 on two different PCs. They get a ""USB device is not recognized"" message. I have to assume these are knock-off products. Beware!"
1,USB Cable was dead on arrival.,USB Cable was dead on arrival. Not cool considering I ran it through a wall.Today's lesson: Test your cords before running them.
1,Not what it says it is.,"This product is not what it says it is. Not a Grey Belkin cable. It doesn't even work, you plug a device in an windows says it is malfunctioning, I'm not even going to bother returning it. I did test it with a low powered device and it worked, and I suspect it would work on a device that has it's own power supply, but don't expect to be plugging anything that needs USB power into it, what a joke."
1,Waste of Time,"Ordered a gray Belkin 10-foot USB extension cable. Got a black NON-Belkin NONWORKING piece of junk.Look, I don't care if the item is generic, that's fine. What I do mind is:*Claiming it's brand-name when it's not so I purchase from you instead of elsewhere*Showing it as one color and sending me another (yes, the cable color matters to me so I can tell cables on my desk apart at a glance.)*Sending me a non-functioning cable, wasting 30 minutes of my time confirming it's broken and boxing it back up. (I see from other reviews now that this is not uncommon.)Looking at the reviews, it seems the ""most helpful"" are from over 10 years ago, when this probably was a legit cable. I can't believe Amazon hasn't blocked this seller from selling one item under another's name and reviews.Guys: seriously, take this crap down and relabel it as what is is."
5,Just Perfect,"Since I'm functionally illiterate in computer tech, it took a while to find the cable 'extension cord' I needed to relocate my Canon MF 4150 printer.With enough length to snake around the back of a 3-foot wide bookcase and across a desk, the 10-foot cable allowed an easy move. There's even room for relocating further from the PC. Nice!The connection was easily made and performance is seamless. Never a glitch or interruption.To reiterate some of the other reviewers' point: This is an EXTENSION cable, akin to an extension cord. Unlike an extension cord, however, length matters. Be sure you've chosen the proper footage for your application.On a final note, the price is exceptional. Lesser quality extension cables (if you can find 'em) at brick and mortar retailers are ridiculously overpriced.This Belkin product helps efficiently utilize space in my small home office. In my non-tech opinion, this extension cable is just perfect."
5,Does the job,"Works well, with no signal glitches. For an electronic device extensioncable that's a big deal. It carries a good, strong signal."
1,Counterfeit,"I purchased this product with the note: ""Sold by MarginMart, Inc. and Fulfilled by Amazon."" I thought it was a great price for a USB extension cable at $3.99 and eligible for free shipping.When I received the actual product, it was packaged in a clear plastic bag with a sticker in very plain fashion stating that it was a ""Belkin F3U134-10 USB Extension Cable (10-Feet) New."" I've worked with Belkin products before, so I was expecting a pretty sturdy cable with their signature USB adapters (as seen in the photo for this product). Instead, it was a pretty flimsy cable with adapters that seem to hold only loosely to other USB ports and cables.Suspicious, I looked up the actual product number on the Belkin website. The product pictured there is nothing like the product I received and retails for $34.99. The product sold by MarginMart is a counterfeit."
3,make the work...,"this item, does not specify the version of usb which support.. and it only support usb 1.1 specificacion... so.. if you are looking for a cable which is capable of transmiting at usb 2.0 speed... well this is not the cable..."
5,desearved to buy,"It works well. The wire looks stong, unlike the one i have previously. The two slots have high quality, not like the cheap ones. Quite happy experience. Thank the buyer."
2,Not really sure about these cables.,"I connect a USB item to these cables and, maybe, %25 of the time it works. I have to fiddle with it to really get any connection. I have older, worn out cables that work better than these."
4,Extension cable,"Was exactly what I needed, arrived in a somewhat timely fashion and I am completely satisfied."
1,not an extension cable,It is advertised as an extension cable but it has two different ends. Can't use it. I already tossed the packaging so I can't return it. (Who would think that an extension cord would be anything but an extension cord????)Don't know if the picker grabbed the wrong item or if Belkin is the problem. Unfortunate
1,Cable does not work!,"I bought 2 cables, both don't work. Sent email to seller, never got a response. Not sure what to do next."
4,Very Handy Product,The product is great and handy if your are trying to extend the cable of your usb devices. Good Built Quality and easy to use. Fast shipping as usual from Amazon
5,Great Cable Great Price,The cable is a quality cable at a great price. No issues with communication even over the 10 feet.
1,"More fool me, I guess.","It doesn't say anywhere in the listing that I could find that this isn't USB 2. My mistake for just assuming it was, I guess. Still, I think they should make it obvious that it isn't 2, since that's pretty much the standard today."
3,cheap enough not to worry about,"I bought this so that I could use my webcam a little farther from the computer but it doesn't work. I see warnings that 16 feet is the limit for usb cables, and with the webcam cable it comes to a total of 15, so I guess I'm on the cusp or something... Ah well, they're cheap enough that I'll just save it and maybe I can use it some other way, not worth returning. No complaints at all about the seller, mind you."
5,As advertised,This is a simple extension cable that works great for things like extending a keyboard or mouse. I used it for that purpose and had no trouble. If you need a longer extension you'll need and active version.
3,USB cables,Product worked well for my needs. The price I paid was very good compared to a retail store. Shipping was on time. Packaged very well. Good by for the money.
3,Beware,"The extension will not support devices such as scanners, etc., but it is OK if you need to extend the cord on your mouse or keyboard."
1,non compatible,"i tried camcorder, camera, 2 phones, a wireless usb card, a usb hub, nothing could connect through to pc, sending back, well, might not be worth it"
1,Worthless,"This cable does not work at all. The end you plug into is too loose for the cables to stay attached, and even when you hold the plugs together, there is no connection."
1,Cables don't work,Ordered 7 USB 10 foot extension cables and none of them work. Windows error pops up indicating that the USB device has malfunctioned no matter what device you plug in. Tried using several different devices and checked all with both direct plug in and a different (properly working) USB extension cable. Fortunately all Amazon purchases are safe and the item has been returned.
2,Not USB 2.0!,"This cable is advertised as having ""480 Mbps transmission speed"" which is false. On the packaging it says only 12 Mbps, meaning this is NOT a USB 2.0 cable. Be careful! I would have left one star but thankfully Amazon let me return the cable without any hassle."
4,Don't use to connect 2 computers together,"One note - if you are looking to connect 2 computers together, you need what is called a ""USB Bridge"" - also known as a USB to USB adapter. Hope this helps"
5,10ft Extension Cable,This extension cord frees up space without any sacrifice in quality. I am ordering another one.
1,NOT BELKIN !!,"The cable I received is not a Belkin cable. It is a cheap no name cable. The picture is of a gray cable with the Belkin name molded in the plastic ends. I received a cheap thin plain black cable in a clear plastic bag with the made in china sticker. It was sold by ""marginmart inc"" and fulfilled by amazon. I feel I was lied to and ripped off."
1,NOT USB 2,"I am usually very ""details aware"" but I also did not realize that this was old-school USB 1 and NOT USB 2 capable."
2,Not that sturdy,Ordered these to hold my menus at my wedding reception. I thought it was a great find especially since it came with so many. But these were so small that they would not even hold my PAPER menus.Whenever I would try to put a menu on them they would just topple over. These things are cheaply made.
4,Destiny's Disguise,"This story had just enough mystery and suspense to hold my attention, but over 350 pages made me somewhat hesitant. Stayed with it and am I glad. It was the relationship and tension between Duane and Destiny that makes it worth the read. For most of the book, it was Duane and Destiny and what would happen next to give her identity away or when would they succumb to their attraction to one another. At one point I was disappointed in Destiny when Duane almost lost his life trying to protect her; however, reading on further, Destiny made it understood of why she failed to ""come clean"".This was a very good read and I am looking forward to Reyn and Garrett's stories.Ms Daniels has proven why she is one of my favorite authors."
3,Avoids discussing her political views,"This book is mainly about leadership, and the leaders that Ms. Harris admires. She is obviously well read and highly principled, but her writing on leadership is not very original. As a fellow native Floridian about the same age, I was much more interested in her biography and her views of the 2000 election, but there is precious little of that information. Most disappointing, there is almost nothing of her political views. As she is now a Member of Congress on the national scene, I would like to know her views on national issues such as defense, taxation, abortion, the role of government, etc., but, except for a little on election reform, it's not in this book."
2,Not enough Election 2000,"First off, although I did not like this book, it is in no way because I do not like Ms. Harris. I believe that she turned into the villan in the eyes of Dems during the post-election days because she was the co-chairwoman of the FL Bush Campaign. However, Dems forget that the state Attorney General was the Chair of the Gore campaign in the state so it was not just Bush that had his foot in the door.With that understanding, I do have to say that it was hard to stay interested in this book. Touted by the publisher when it came out as the true inside story, really only a small portion of the book is dedicated to Election 2000. Instead Ms. Harris gives us a list and discription of her favorite historical leaders and writers.So if it is an old history lesson you want, then buy the book but if you want election 2000, go some place else."
1,Disgusting and Shameless,"I wish I could vote -0- stars.I thought that perhaps Ms. Harris would have some honest yet misguided notions about her responsibility in the 2000 elections. Instead, I might as well have read a book by Colter. Nothing but nonsense. No real factual information to explain her decisions, no excuse for refusing to recuse herself and no explanation as to why she wouldnt allow a thorough recount to ensure that democracy won out. I wonder how much she was paid to sell out the american people and the democracy all these republicans claim to love."
1,Tell us like it really was.,"It would have been a much better book if Ms. Harris just told us like it was...that she was the chief election official of the state AND campaign chair of the Bush campaign, did not recuse herself and was instructed by Jeb and George to ""cook the books"" and help throw the Presidency to someone who was not elected by the voters and, in that process, deny thousands the right to vote."
5,A BOOK OF HOPE AND FAITH,"KATHERINE HARRIS`S BOOK ""CENTER OF THE STORM"" HAS SOME AWSOME PRINCIPLES THAT I HAVE HELPED ME,GIVEN ME FAITH, AND HOPE.I HAVE EPIPSEY THAT HAS A BIG STORM IN MY LIFE AND THIS WONDERFUL BOOK GIVES ME ALOT OF COURAGE. THESE PAGES ALSO HAVE ALOT OF FAITH AND PEACE WRITTION IN THEM AND THEY HAVE MADE MY LIFE ALOT BETTER AND THE PRINCIPLES CONTAINED HERE HAVE GIVEN ME A BETTER LIFE AND I HOPE SOMEDAY THAT I CAN THANK MRS HARRIS FOR THESE GREAT PRINCIPLES FOR MAKING MY LIFE BETTER."
2,A journalistic dud,"Katherine Harris writes a good book. She is intelligent and is a capable writer. To that end, her book explores significant moral questions and offers sound leadership guidelines. However, ""Center of the Storm"" is bannered as the definitive account of the controversial November 7, 2000 presidential election in the state of Florida.On that note, this book is a journalistic dud. She fails to answer crucial questions. Moreover, some appraisals of her work are self-serving. In conclusion, the controversy swirling around the performance of the Florida Secretary of State during a sensational period in American history will not subside with the publication of this book. It will only linger."
3,Liberal Boo Hooing,"Sophmoric and one-sided, the authors make no attempts to hide their political persuasion. The book is entertaining in the same way a todler's tantrum at the grocery is. It reveals nothing unpublished elsewhere. For the liberals who collect books on how represive, biggoted, racist, powerful republicans ruin America, this will be a welcome addition to their collections. For the student of history or electioneering look elsewhere...Pros: Good toilet reading!Cons: Too biased to be taken seriously."
5,"Not Again, Not Here!",I want to know what really happened with the Butterfly Ballot issue in Florida and why. I highly recommend this book to all readers who have had the same questions and also to those who hold their votes and democracy sacred. Jews for Buchanan: The Theft of the American Presidency provides the truth about an election run amuck. John Nichols and David Deschamps provide a compelling and true narrative on WHY elections such as Election 2000 should never happen again and give reason to why it is certainly justifiable that the registered Democratic voters who were turned away and who intended to vote for Gore on the Butterfly Ballot should have been allowed a second chance to vote for President in Election 2000.
2,"i hate everything by Estero after the ""breath from another cd""","I purchased this cd along with ""we are in need of a musical revolution"" on the strength of the joy i got from her first cd, ""breath from another,"" when i was in college. However, i came to see that it was not Estero but her producers who made ""breath from another"" so lovable."
3,Buy it,"Esthero's single (og. bitch) is a edgy and moody song that is well produced. The remixes are ok, the best is the Speakeasy - which best compliments her voice and still pays homage to the original withough laying some hard beats over it & calling it a day. I love you is one soulful song. This is worth it, even with some dismal remixes sprinkled around some good cuts."
1,"This book was a bit repetetive, and over-formalized.","Hoping for an interesting perspective on the ideas of Glenn Gould, I purchased this book. For the most part, the book sounded like an overdone research paper, in which the author stated a thesis, and spent the rest of the book attempting to validate this thesis. If I were grading this paper, I would definitely subtract points for the repetetive set of ideas that kept resurfacing under different headings. These ideas were well recieved the first time around, but I would expect a fan of Glenn Gould to come up with a more creative way of proving that Mr. Gould's ideas were consistent and meaningful. For anyone interested in Glenn Gould, I would suggest something written by Mr. Gould himself, he knew what he was saying, and I see the interpetations of others as a hindrance to Gould's message."
3,Good general information,"This book provides history of trading and the web. There is also good basic economic and marketing information. However, after stating that every business needs to be on the Internet the book doesn't provide much in the way of practical advice. Some of the predictions for the future have already happened and others don't seem all that realistic. It seems he was caught up in the hype of the times. Interesting reading, but needs to be taken with a grain of salt."
3,"fun plot, horridly frustrating end!","I am an extremely loyal fan of the Georgia books, and was greatly anticipating this fourth chapter of the delightfully droll series. The plot was funny, as usual, and had some interesting points, including the trip to Paris, but the resolution upset me. First of all, I was under the impression that this was to be the final book of the series. However, Rennison either doesn't understand how to end series, or lied about this being the last of Georgia, because the book had very little closure. She waited until the final pages to once again bring up the conflict of Dave the Laugh v. SG, and then gave us a pitiful excuse for a cliffhanger as to the outcome. I could forgive this action if there is indeed another book on the way, but otherwise, i'm sorely disappointed."
3,confessions,"I really liked this book. I would recomend this book to teenagers becuase it is mostly about dating guys and girls I think that this book is really cool becuase there is this dictionary in the back that has all these made up words in it and all through the story are all those made up words, and i think that it is cool becuase some of the words are really weird like porkies and spondulicks. The main person in the story is named georgia and she is in love with this guy "" The sex god "" which has something to do with another book like this one ""On the bright side im now the girlfriend of a sex god"" Georgia gets really confused in the book becuase of her friends going out with each other and then not. I also think that this is a really cool book becuase its like a big diary and it has mostly times instead of dates in it and i always liked books like that. So thats what i think of the book and who i recomend it to!"
4,Really Good Teen Book,"I think that this book was very good. I think that only teenagers should read it and i think that only teens would like it.Its mostly about a girl named Georgia and how she loves this guy ""The Sex God"" and how she wants to go out with him. Then the sex god n her friend dave the laugh break up and Georgia gets all confused and dosent have any clue what to do. Its also a very cool book becuase it has a dictionary thing in the back and there are all these words in the book that you have to go in the back and look for. They r made up really weird words. There are also many different books (like this one) and i think that they will be just as cool."
3,Dear diary,"Dancing in my nuddy pants by:louise rennison is a fun and hilarious tale about a thirteen year old girl and her friends living in England.In this book Georgia (the main character) must choose between Robbie ""the sex god"" or Dave ""the laugh"". Even though Georgia cant keep her lips off the SG(sex god)she is having second thoughts about their relationship .NOw that her Ex Boyfriend dave the laugh has broken up with his last girlfriend Georgia must choose to either be a pop star girlfriend on the road or try again with dave . Between the relationship problems,georgia also has a class trip to attend. This book can relate to teenagers today and is a perfect book for a good laugh."
5,CAN U BELIEVE IT? EVEN MORE GEORGIA! Read On...,"Yet again another book as finally come out. I have been waiting for this book forever! I read the other 3 books in less than a month. They relate so much to me. I just can't put the book down. My friend one day told all of us to pass these books around and whithin weeks we were all going crazy about her crazy, angus, boys, and other stories! We love them. I also encourage the author to keep on writting because the Americans are LOVING IT!*"
5,HILARIOUS AWESOME BOOK!!!,"I've been waiting for this book forever, and finished it in one day. It is soooo funny!!!! Georgia is so sarcastic and a hilarious person. ""What in the name of Buddha's bra is going on?"" hahaha if you haven't read these books, read them NOW! you will not regret it, trust me."
4,dancing naked?? funny,Again Georgia is back. She is still having trouble with her red bottom but she is learning to cope with it. She learns the way of the horn (how much you fancy someone) and decides she has the general horn for Dave the L. (so that explains why she keeps snogging him on accident J). She is still going out with Robbie though and later in the story to Georgia's dismay it is reviled that Robbie must go to Australia for a year L. I am so glad that there is a sequel to this story because this book leaves some questions unanswered.
1,no nuddy,"Rennison doesn't put much thought in this book. The other three books in this series are comical and are very interesting. This one gives little smiles, and make a good ending."
2,A Major Let Down,"While of course extremely amusing and full of hilarious situations, Rennison's fourth installment in the Georgia Nicolson series is old, overdone, and just plain boring. Sure, some points are funny, but the whole scenarios are exactly the same as they were in the other three books. Georgia obsesses over Robbie. Georgia antagonizes over her lingering feelings for Dave the Laugh. Yawn, yawn, yawn. Jas seems like a total Girl Scout (no offense to Girl Scouts or anything), and the rest of Georgia's friends are just lame. Like, please. Who actually does a disco dance and finds it FUNNY?!?!I have been looking forward to this one forever, but it's lost the charm. Ah, well, perhaps I've outgrown Georgia Nicolson and Mia Thermopolis...so sad. Not.Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to reread Bridget Jones's Diary and find some REAL humor."
5,Some Folks Feel the Rain - Others Just Get Wet,Our Bible Study Group just begin this study. It seems like it is going to a very good study. Thanks for making it available to us.
3,Dylan?,The book title is taken right from a Dylan song but the book makes no reference to the song from which it was taken.
4,Los 7 Arcangeles,Este libro contiene mensajes de los 7 Arcangeles; lo que no es corriente en otros libros. Debe leerse con gran atencion para captar debidamente los mensajes.
3,If I could do it over I'd buy a different frame,The built in memory is worthless. It freezes the whole frame up requiring you to reboot it. Buy a memory card. The alarm clock and mp3 player are barely audible. It does display pictures well off the card. But this one still has a ghost in the machine.
2,some thoughts about the flexibility manual,"I found the book quite useful, especially the last section was very good, but I think there are better ways to use your money (Kurz - strecthing scientically). I expected more thorough treatment of the principles of flexibility, but something was lacking."
3,Good book to use to learn how to create web enabled apps.,Definitely a good starter for learning to create web enabled Notes applications. The section on Domino URLs is particularly enlightening. Does not quite cover some of the real tough situations that can come up (Still need to go to the Domino Discussion DB at www.Notes.net for that.
5,Description does not match the tool,"The description says a 6 piece set includes 8, 9, 10mm wrenchs. This item is only for tool 49 which is only a 10mm wrench and 6mm square head. The tool itself looks good quality, the problem is with the description"
5,"AZ- ""The Come Up""",AZ....what else can i say. Nice smooth voice with some great lyrics and great production. This should be the best cd of 05 because i have heard nothing better but 50 cent or some whack artist will win cuz of popularity. Az is a underrated in the hip hop game and will prob always be. People need to get out there and support him because this is the best rap i have seen in years with all this pop crap out ya feel..? neways im feelin the whole CD but i dont think it was necessary to put bounty killer on there but az still rips it on that song. No matter how much i say this cd is good it prob will be underrated but you know what Az is doin his thing and he is on his game right now...Stab u in yo throat with a icepick hahaTop 3 Songs:1.The Come up2.New York feat.ghostface and Raekwon3.Can't Stop
5,"can't stop,won't stop","next Blueprint!another BK classic,Nas' protegee AZ finally contribute a classic album with no filler tracks..nice lyrix,nice flow and nice productions.my top 5 track:1.The Come Up2.Never Change3.Street Life ft.Half-a-Mil(RIP)& Begetz4.Can't Stop5.New York ft.Raekwon & Ghostface Killahand there's a dope track ""Magic Hour"" featuring CL Smooth appears as a bonus.so take it now!"
3,AZ's back,"I am a bit disappointed by AZ's A.W.O.L. This album lacks of consistance. I love ""Do Or Die"", which in my humble opinion is a masterpiece (just like Nas' ""Illmatic""), but A.W.O.L. seems like a mixtape with major lack of coherence.There are standout tracks, such as ""Never Change"", ""Can't Stop"", ""City Of Gods"", ""The Come Up"" and the Bonustrack #2 ""Magic Hour"", but the rest of the album just seems to be randomly and unkindly put together.AZ is one of the best MCs in the business (no doubt), but he needs to come up with a neatly organized album. I am thinking about DJ Premier, Pete Rock and Buckwild to produce it with guest appearances by Nas, CL Smooth, Common and Cormega.None the less, pick up this CD to support AZ. He is one of the last true rappers in the business! Check out AZ's Greatest Hits CD ""Decade 94-04"", which is hard to find in the US. This album rocks!"
5,"great, straight to my ""best 2005 albums"" list","i really liked this album, every track is great, lyrics and beats are real...gangsta? get this sh*t, hear it and then tell me who's gangstabest tracks:All of 'em#4 on my list"
4,AZ IS STILL ALIVE!!!!,"Ok for all of you who don't know AZ because you're too busy listening and copping that garbage they play on the radio, he's been one of the best MC'S in the game since his verse on Life's a bitch (see Nas - Illmatic). I've been a fan of his since DOE OR DIE he is one of the most underrated MC'S. His flow is unbelievable, his delivery, his rhymes and the production is reminiscent to the 90's hip-hop. But anyway back to A*W*O*L this is a dope cd but it's missing 2 hot songs that should have been on here that were going to be on FINAL CALL. ""Seems that way"" and ""Serious"" featuring Nas, if those 2 tracks would have been on here this album would have gotten 5 stars from me, but don't let that stop you from copping this album GO GET IT!!!(...)"
2,Az is hot but this album is not,there was like two decent tracks and one that was fire. listen to how ya livin feat. nas and put it next to anything on this album this just cant stack against any other AZ past or present
1,AZ SUCKS,"AZ who the heck is that. He aint kepping it crunk, noone even know whow he be. AZ sucks!! I know this kid who told me AZ is good But this is a lie Mike Jones,Bun B,and even 50 cent are better than AZ"
5,AZ Purely Poet,"Anthony Cruz has been burning mics since Life's A B-tch! His heartfelt flow and raw street mentality is the definition of what hip hop is all about. Lyrics for days and realism for nights, AZ is by far probably the most underrated in the game. And with hip hop stuck in the state of mind it is in now, it looks as though he'll continue to stay underrated. But for hip hop heads, AWOL is definately on point in every aspect on the album. From production to lyrics. Best song on the album is Street Life followed by The Come Up. ""Pac is gone, the state of Hip-hop is wrong, and if you want more then log onto AZ.com""...Cop this album if you want the truth, you will not be disappointed on the money well spent!"
5,He Hasn't Lost His Touch,"Once again AZ brings street crafted rhymes over pure hip hop music. The production on this LP is solid, much like all the work he puts out. For AZ fans this will sure help re-kindle their hip hop light."
4,A.Z brings another top album to the rap game.,Not his best work but defintly top three. 1. Pieces of a Man2. Do or Die 3. A.W.O.L. If you like quality rap music with a message than you can't go wrong with A.Z. This guy has been underrated for years and now is his time to shine. This album is worth the money
5,AZ is back finally.,"With AZ back, Nas and Ruggedman will actually have some lyrical competition. AZ has always been hot, since 9 lives til now. But this CD solidifies his career. This one is as good, if not better then 9 lives. This CD is great because if youve heard az before and were waiting for this album, he lived up to your hype, but also, if you havent heard him before he gives you a taste of real rap. Buy this album, its worth it. If you havent heard him, definitely give him a try, hes the reeal deal. The standout track list IS the track list on the back of the CD so no need for that here. GET THIS CD"
3,Harley Headset is adequate...,"I have had a couple of these models. The head adjustment could be better. The tension is to extreme on the ears. The volume is good with the ""mega bass"" ON. You should always get a set with double batteries. Because the power is stronger and the signal is better. The SONY's with the single battery is inadequate. I have had a couple of them no good. A digital headset though is the BEST. Look to a KOSS HR110 much better than the two I reviewed."
1,Garbage,"I was able to use this product about 3 times. It then began to lose volume to almost nothing. I would put new batteries in it, but that didn't help. Because I had thrown out the paperwork, I threw them in the garbage and bought some from someone I trusted, Sony, and they have been working great every time."
2,this is not really a book!very mechanically technical,"this magazine quarterly is aimed at breeding and selling koi by the millions . we are talking about mega breeding, not what a hobbyist or small breeder is trying, or probably capable of doing.very slick with beautiful pictures of little use."
1,Koi Breeding,I found the title of this book misleading. There is little to no relevant information on the breeding of koi from the hobbiest or small buisness owners perspective. The book provided information for large scale koi production using artificial fertilization and hatching methods.
1,"Not a bible, not for professionals","This book is not more than hundrend small pages of text, considering that it has double line spacing and large indentation. It covers only the basics about telecommunication billing systems and it is not useful for professionals. It might be useful for those who are irrelevant to telecommunications and would like to answer a few primitive questions about the subject."
5,******************5 STARS************************,"I generally don't review books but a book so comprehensive on this difficult subject is extremely hard to locate. This book is an excellent reference for Telecommunications Billing. The information on infrastructure and technological concepts are very informative. The book was very easy to read and I found it more useful than any other book I could find on the subject. If you need information about telecom billing, telecom business processes, this is the book for you!!. Excellent!!!"
3,This books is also available online,This is a good introduction to the Ruby language.You can decide if you want to buy it or not by first reading the online version at http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com
5,First Rate introduction and reference,"I have nothing to say about this book that is any different from the other reviewers. This book is an excellent introduction to the Ruby language. It is one of the best written/presented book I have read in a very long time. The book touches upon all aspects of Ruby, beginning with the core language, its constructs and then goes on to other technologies (Automations for instance). Even though the book does not dwell on any ""advanced"" topic (ie Network API, Win32, Automation etc.), it can still serve as an indispensable reference to the Ruby developer and the pragmatic programmer."
4,Can't make up your mind between SmallTalk and Python?,"I got ahold of this book, after deciding it was high time to learn a new language. I was tired of C++ and Java, and started peeking at SmallTalk and Python. Being less than enthusiastic about both, I delayed until a friend mentioned Ruby.""Sigh. YASL!(Yet-Another-Scripting-Language)"" was my first thought, but upon closer inspection I found it to be the kind of middle ground I wanted.The book is great as an introductory read. It briefly passes thru and mentions all aspects, slowing down on the more important ones, and covers alot of ground on a more light note. As a reference and indepth study, it is less useful, but this is more due to the young age of the Ruby language and libraries, than a failure of the book.Both the language and the book make for excellent brainfeed."
1,Too soon,Dear SirsI did not received yet French II - 3rd EditionTus delivery is very late.Michael Malogolowkin
4,I wish they offered an accompaying text book,I agree with others who wish that Pimsleur French would offer an accompanying text that would follow the audio version. I find that learning only by rote and memorization doesn't help my recognition of French text or how to pronounce it as it is written. I'm ready for French II and would buy it in a heart beat if an an accompanying text was also offered. I'm making too many of the same mistakes. If I could see it written I could get past these hurdles.
2,don't believe the specs,"I am sure this camera operates well in a laboratory environment, but in a field environment--not so much. I think I will buy a Nikon next"
4,Good camera - Poor Basic Manual,"This is a very good camera but I'm not too crazy about the software that is used to download it to my computer. Also, when I looked in the basic manual for instructions on how to format the 1 gig xD picture card, there was no information. I spent some time looking for the menu for formatting the card and eventually found it. Why can't people write manuals worth a damn?"
2,Only worked for a week,"I bought this camera to replace my cannon camera. I thought the picture quality was excellent, but the menu and options were cumbersome to get to. Also, the charger was huge and very irritating to use. I bought this camera specifically for a vacation and it stopped working during the actual vacation. Needless to say, I was really upset. On a positive note, amazon refunded all my money and even paid for the return shipping."
1,"Camera Okay, Software Horrible","There's a slight delay between pressing the shutter release and actually having it fire. Indoor pictures always seem overexposed. The $7 disposable film cameras in the grocery store take better pictures.What's infuriating about this camera is the Olympus Master software that comes with it. It has context sensitive menus, so the icon you're looking for is often nowhere to be found. There's no File->Open or File->Save options, so you're forced to do things their way. In my opinion, both approaches to user interface design should be criminal. To be fair, you can figure out basic functions by reading the manual, but have no illusions that you'll be working for this camera more than this camera will be working for you."
5,This is a great camera~,"I love this camera. It's very quick when taking multiple pictures. It's small and stylish, and very user friendly. I like how it has all those different settings to take pics in all type of settings (pun intended lol. I'm def finding plenty of occasions to try them all out. My friends have even threatened to take my camera away, lol."
2,Very unimpressed,"We got our first batch of pictures developed a couple days ago and thought that the developer must have screwed up. Just to check, we took several of the same shots with our new 10MP Olympus and our 5yr old Canon (2MP). We had them developed by CVS (mistake) and Walgreens and noted that the Canon pictures were superior in each case. Why did we just spend $300 for this? I understand and appreciate that the default auto setting delivers lower quality, but I'm not going to be the only person using this, and if the auto setting is inferior to my five year old 2MP camera, I don't need it. Adding insult to injury, Amazon is not making this easy to return (their e-mail with the link to the return printout keeps coming sans link). I've made hundreds of orders from Amazon before and this is only my 2nd return."
2,"Bad pictures, especially for 10 megapixels","We received this camera as a gift for christmas and took it out for pictures on new year's eve. i did not take too much time to familiarize myself with the camera as every other camera i have ever used was basically point and click with the best results on automatic mode. the following day i excitedly looked at the pictures expecting awesome results from our first 10 megapixel camera. well, i could not have been more disappointed. as the other reviews indicated, the pictures are grainy, blurry, and washed out. granted, i was in a dark, smoke filled bar, but i have had previous cameras with fewer megapixels that returned decent pictures under similar conditions. later, fooling around with the camera, even on the full auto mode, indoors, with average lighting, the camera still disappointed. like the other reviews, we ended up returning the camera. for 10 megapixles, i expect a lot more from a camera."
4,Metal detector,"I purchased the metal detector for my grandson (7). He is enjoying it thoroughly, even was excited when it detected a foil covered chocolate on Christmas morning."
2,A Childs toy,It is very short and meant for ages 8 - 10. I am 12 years old and I feel it was a waste of my money. It is only good on a beach where you can easily dig a big hole.
4,Great series!,"I enjoyed this book and the other two in the trilogy very much.not usually the type of books I read but the first one was on sale for kindle.after that I had to read the others.I love the characters this author created.I love the animals.I have border collies,horses and have had birds so I felt a kinship with this author and the snippets of agility and other animal stuff she put in..made me feel like I had a kinship with herThe story is great,an easy read,I read them quickly.I will get other books by this author. Great job!"
3,confusing,"I love Mapson, I love the bad girls, I love every other novel by Mapson. I want to love this book so badly and had of course, pre-ordered it, but I found it confusing. It seemed choppy, and the characters didn't seem to flow from the first two books. There wasn't enough conflict? I'm not sure. I am a loyal fan and will try re-reading it after reading the first two more recently, and maybe the pieces of the puzzle will fit together better. Usually her books make me feel like I'm sailing down a blue river on a wonderful raft. Like I can't wait to spend more time inside the covers of the book. This one I was able to put down no problem. Never less than three stars for Jo-Ann though...."
5,Yankee's World Series Video,"I purchase this video for my son for Christmas. He was very happy to receive it. I'm not sure if he's watched it yet. But being a real Yankee fan, I'm sure there can't be anything wrong with it."
1,Releashed in 2001....try 1981!!!!,"I bought this game for $5 at Staples in a bargain bin like 10yrs ago. I played and beat the first ""Vietnam"" game and for what it was worth, thought it was pretty fun. I remember it was one of the first FPS games where you could knife people.This game however is a joke. Must of been made by a different company because the graphics, gameplay, storyline....everything is far worse than the original. Comparing it to FPS games like ""Unreal"" during that time period, this game looks like it was made in the early 80's because it has ancient graphics and is as glitchy as ""E.T."" for the Atari 2600.I probably put about 30hrs into it only because I was a goofy teen who wanted to get his $5 worth, but looking back I was a fool to have played the game for more than 20 minutes. If you know somebody who has a copy then help burn it for them cause the world is better off not knowing this game even existed..haha!"
1,Vietnam review,I did not get to play this game because it only runs on windows 98 I did not realize this when I bought it. Very disappointed.
5,A Joy to hear,"This is a beautiful recording of the German Mass by Schubert. Recorded in Germany and sung in German this music lifts your spirit. THe quality of the recording is good, though sometimes the words are hard to understand, even for a native German speaker, though I attribute this to the music.Well worth the money."
5,"Profound, and uplifting","Gabriel Cousens wrote this masterpiece back in 1986, but everything within the book still applies 100% to today's world, and will likely go on for years and years, never needing a revision.Cousens writes from the heart, and tells how his journey into living foods has openened up a new world of love, spirituality, and peace that he never though possible. This book covers all the bases, from how long we could possibly life, to religion, to the best diet, and so on.An excellent read for anyone, and an amazing amount of information for anyone who seeks to take themselves to the next level of consciousness."
5,Spiritual Nutrition was my 'wake-up' call!,"I was lucky enough to meet a friend who told me about this wonderful DVD by Dr. Gabriel Cousens.At age 46, I suffered from everything from sleepless nights, twenty extra pounds from anxious overeating, and a stiff neck that wouldn't seem to go away.There is so much information in this 2 1/2 hr DVD that I watched it five times! I finally 'got' what I had been doing wrong.From what I have learned from Spiritual Nutrition, I have already lost fifteen pounds and have been studying yoga with new insight. I can't wait to visit the Tree of Life rejuvenation center. I'm convinced this is the safest way to conduct a fast especially for the first time."
2,Not my cup of tea,"Very, very long read. If you want a no-crap nutrition book then don't buy this. If on the other hand you want to read pages and pages of information that you are never likely to read, and seems out there crazy like, then this book is for you."
4,If You're In Need Of A Guru,"I'm into the health food movement like a lot of people nowdays. Unfortunately most books and programs don't cover all of the many ways to get and stay healthy. Although the above book listed is an excellent resource. It's like most authors and programs are trying to be too pc (politically correct). To correct myself a little, most health advice, programs, books and supplements usually offer pretty good advice these days.You know:1. Don't alcohol2. Don't abuse drugs3. Don't smoke (cigaretts and the like)4. Eat move live fresh fruits and vegetables.5. Eat less process foods and meats.Now all of this is good advice, although there is a right way and wrong way to do anything. I saw an excellent book with a good 8 step plan. Search Amazon for: The Magic Of Mother Nature's Healing Foods. I liked it."
2,Not for the faint hearted,"What is this trite, I want my money back. Pretentious ""Bible Bashing "" from a collection of boring writers, give it a miss."
5,Mandatory resource for any serious amateur or pro photograph,"This is by far the best book of it's kind. Excellent diagrams and descriptions walk you through the ""hows"", but more importantly the ""whys"" of creating dramatic and interesting lighting effects. A variety of set ups are used from existing light to 7-light set ups. Tungsten, strobe and quartz lighting, and even camera mounted flash examples are given. I would've liked a little more information on how to meter the various scenes and occasionally more description of how certain unusual effects were created but it is a mandatory resource for anyone who is serious about their portraiture and wants to be able to expand their current repetoir."
4,Not For The Amatuer,This outstanding book title says it all...with an emphasis on PRO. With few exceptions this book addresses studio lighting. The lighting techniques are explained well and in detail. However you will need significant lighting equipment to employ the techniques identified.
3,"Good, But Not a Real How-to-Do-It book","It's a well done book of its type-good photos, good lighting diagrams, and high quality typography. But like most of its genre it does not give the ""nuts and bolts"" of how to set up and run a photo studio. For this I find the books of Scott Smith to be outstanding."
2,Not What I Thought It Would Be,"This book definately did not live up to its average four star rating. As a pro photographer I can tell you that it lacked any detail regarding exposures, exact positions and angles of lighting, posing techniques and a number of other important areas of portraiture. A number of the examples were written in German, many of the lighting products were from Europe, and only one of the photographers profiled was from the U.S., which is important in regards to accepted styles.If you want basic pictures of lighting set-ups and ideas for using films that are no longer very popular, this is the book for you."
1,Deceptive title,"This package is one box of 100 zip top sandwich bags. Do not be fooled by the title which includes ""12/case"". This is not a case of sandwich bags. It is one box of sandwich bags. As such, amazon has other, cheaper options."
4,table top wine chiller,a great alternative to sticking a wine bottle in the freezer and then forgetting about it!
1,Noisy Wine Cooler,I bought this with the idea of keeping a bottle of wine cool close at hand. Sort of an ice bucket next to the table without the mess of ice. It is so noisy that it was intrusive and I returned it.
2,It's Going Back,"I bought this because there are almost no alternatives. I'm returning it because it isn't as useful to me as my refrigerator. First, it is very noisy; about like a cheap bathroom fan. Second, it cools very slowly. Third, one can't override the preset temperatures. Perhaps there are people who would take the ""expert"" recommendation without question; I wouldn't. I like white wines VERY cold; this unit is hard-pressed to cool to 41degrees F. Next time, I'll try a Cooper Cooler."
1,ngcfounder,"This product does not fulfill its promises. After 55 minutes in chiller, a room temperature (72)bottle of Chardonnay dropped 4 degrees which was still 20 degrees away from the target. It promises fast chilling and doesn't deliver. Disappointed as this was a gift for husband at holidays."
1,"Worst product ever, don't know why it was invented!","This product is 100% useless!!! We got it as a gift and was so excited about it. Can someone from Waringpro PLEASE tell me why this would be at all useful when you can chill a bottle of wine in the freezer for 1/4 of the time with no noise! I put a bottle of riesling in and it set it to chill to 46 degrees. It registered it at 78 and an hour and 15 mins later it still had 14 degrees to go, not to mention that it sounded like a helicopter was taking off in our kitchen for an hour and 15 mins. I mean seriously, who is working in the Quality Control department at WaringPro? If we could rate it zero stars I would have!"
1,Doesn't work - donated it to Goodwill right away,"I can't believe all the luxury retailers are still stocking this bad gadget! It makes me mad just to see it still on store shelves. I had the exact bad experience as everyone here. It is loud (humming fan), takes a horribly long time to chill wine (faster to just put your wine in the freezer for a quick chill-up), and is just a white elephant. I paid good money for it but had no choice - it went to Goodwill right away. Don't buy it, you will regret your dollars."
1,Piece of junk,"The amount of noise given off by the fans is the deal breaker for me, I just can't live with it. If it chilled the wine quickly enough it might be worth using it (in another room so that it isn't as annoying) but it's just way too slow to be anything other than a waste of time and money."
1,Don't buy it,"I agree with the first reviews. It's not that it's loud (very), it just doesnt cool a bottle of wine. My first bottle I tried I set to ""Chablis"". It said the temperature was 64, and it was being cooled to 46. It sounds like a hair dryer turned on and left on your counter. I set a timer. 30 minutes later it said the temperature was 60. I took it out and it didnt feel noticeably cooler at all. Cheap junk."
1,Didn't work as advertised,"Got one as a Christmas present - great concept, but the performance falls well short of the promise.As another reviewer noted, wine from my wine fridge (56 deg.) registered as 74 deg. when placed into the unit; wine at room temp (72 deg.) regularly registered 78 deg. or so. Although the unit ran through it's cycle and indicated wine had been chilled to the proper temperature it never was. In fact, if you put the bottle back into the unit immediately and started it again it would register a temperature about 10 degrees warmer than it had indicated just seconds earlier.I tried about half-a-dozen times over a couple days, but it never worked properly.We returned the unit to the store for credit."
1,Unit is junk,"I bought this for my girlfriend for Christmas. She was excited to get it and we tried it out Christmas day. The unit, straight out of the box, wouldn't power up.Back to the store the day after Christmas for an exchange. Took the second one home, same problem.Went to Amazon to read reviews to see if anyone else had this problem, and, after reading the mostly bad reviews, I'm not going to waste my time on a third unit.Concept sounds really good, guess it is just bad execution."
1,doesn't perform well,"I gave this to my husband, and he tried it immediately on a bottle of white wine. It took over two hours before it said it was ready. But only the bottom was slightly chilled. We'll stick to ice in a ceramic chiller!"
4,I enjoy mine.,"I don't have this brand. I was gifted another brand that starts with a ""B"". It looks the same, but costs a little more. I enjoy using it since I usually have a bottle at night. It keeps the temp right where you set it. It does take a while and I would suggest having your wine chilled already or be willing to wait 2 hours for it to come down in temp. Though, once I open a bottle it keeps it perfect temp for the next few hours that I might enjoy drinking it.One complaint I have it large cham-pain bottles don't fit in the narrow hole. though I have not found a wine bottle that does not fit. If you don't want to mess with ice and water, I would suggest this unit. if you are looking for a rapid cooler 20 minutes in the freezer would work better.Ultimatly, if this were to break, I would buy another one.Cheers,RS"
2,Looks better then it works,"Out of the box the Waring Pro Wine Chiller seems to be a home run purchase. It's sleek, innovative and easy to use. Unfortunately it doesn't really work all that well.If your looking for a cool looking product that will keep your *already* chilled wine cool then this works great! (without the mess of using ice) However, taking a room temperature bottle of wine and trying to get it the temperature needed is close to impossible.Pros: Looks greatKeeps a cold bottle of wine cold without an ice bucketQuietCons: Does not chill a room temperature bottle of winePower cord is bulkyLCD can be a little hard to read at times"
4,Must Be Best for Reds,"I am also surprised by all the bad reviews of this product. The trend seems to show that this product must not be useful for white wines, however, whites can be stored in the fridge or cooled down by ice bath, so not sure why one would use this product for a white.I received this as a gift a few years ago and we use it every time we open a bottle of wine, which is a few times a week. The device seems to start out at a high temp, as some have mentioned, but it also drops quickly which leads one to believe it is actually taking time to adjust to the actual temp of the wine placed in the chamber. We have never had a problem with this device, it works wonderfully on red wines. It never takes more than 15 minutes to cool the wine."
2,Not worth the money,Bought this product to save myself some time and not have to worry about loosing wines bottles in the freezer. It doesn't cool to the right temperature takes for ever do yourself a favor and buy a better product better to spend $100 on something that does what it says then to suffer buyers remorse
5,Beautifully illustrated and written,"A great book to learn about healing and channeling your energies in a more positive way. The book has many 'gems' in terms of ideas, thoughts, and basic healthly, positive principles of living -- for the novice to the expert person who is on a spiritual quest to a more fulfilling life. Buy it!"
4,great trimmer head,"Ordered this as a replacement for my husqvarna 26 lc. Quick shipping , easy replacement, comes loaded with husqvarna titanium string. Great Product, Great Price."
1,Misleading discription,"It says ""six motor"".... well its vibrating motors, not the one with circular motoin massage. Heating pad does not heat up much.Since Amazon requires more then 20 words in review, I would metion here that Groupon had better price $25.00."
1,Lousy quality,"This thing doesn't massage, just vibrate, and two of the motors died quickly. Although the product is supposed to be covered by 2 year warrenty, the customer service is non-existent. Stay away from this, definitely not worth the money."
3,Great Massage but limited,"It is a great massage, I only wish I could leave it on for more than 30 minutes as the instructions read that if it is kept on longer than 30 minutes it may burn out."
5,Love it!,I have owned this for over 5 years. Recently started reusing it because my back was hurting. Works great just as I remembered and would buy it again in a heart beat. Originally bought it as we were driving 5300 miles in 2 1/2 weeks on vacation and this was a butt and back saver while driving for extended periods of time.
3,Not what I was expecting...,Thought this book would have more tips & tricks for listening. Still thought it was an interesting read with many good perspectives. This book is a collection of many short stories not one long story.
5,The Standard Text for the Cisco Course,"This book is a general introduction to networking the Cisco way. It is used as a textbook by many of the training academies that are preparing students for the Cisco CCNA exam. It is also recommended by most of those that don't absolutely require it as an additional source of study and practice materials.This is the first book in the series and begins with 'What's a Network.' From there it goes step by step to the last chapter which is on TCP/IP Transport and Application Layers. The book is written like a text, and when the course of study is finished it should be kept as a reference book. It also contains numerous questions as a way to check your understanding of the material and your readiness to pass the certification exam.The CD-ROM that is included with the book contains additional information, interactive media that visually demonstrate key topics, and other learning tools."
5,The best networking book I ever read,"I am 48 yo and I am studying IT to re-qualify myself to find a new job.Years ago I studied networks basics but I really didn't grasp the subject.Now I read this book and I found clear explanations that led me to better understanding what's going on in LANs and WANs.There are only two chapters that I found hard to follow, because they are heavily focused on the IEEE specifications (that sure are important but also very complex and full of confusing achronyms), but that apart, now I can say that my knowledge about LANs, NICs, MAC, LLC, Hub, Switches, Routers, ecc.. ecc.. is really clear.It's well written and very useful if you works in IT fields or even if you are curious to understand the fundamentals of networking, that is a very complex subject."
1,I say NO!,"I first saw Patricia as a guest chef on Ming Tsai's PBS show Simply Ming. Together, the chefs made a deep fried fish dish. Patricia sounded interesting so I decided to give her cookbook a try. After searching long and hard for a copy, I was very disappointed with her book. I'm a pretty simple girl, but her dishes were way too fancy! This is not recommended for the beginning cook. It was overly complicated, hard to follow, and none of her dishes really jumped out to me. I ended up giving the cookbook to my boyfriend...haha, SUCKER! I say no to this cookbook! No!"
1,A lover of piano music,"This cd just lacks something. It didn't ""touch"" me nearly as much as others artists of the same genre. I'd pass on this cd"
5,Great workout video for families!,I was looking for a video for my kids to help them have fun exercising on those days when it's cold or rainy! I ended up with a video that is FUN FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY! we enjoy it so much! i even like to do this video when i'm exercising alone! it's not just for kids but it's easy enough that kids can catch on quick and get a great workout. it's got wonderful up to date dance moves with great cardiac benefit!
2,Too dancy,I was looking for something for our kids to get exercise during the cold winter months. This one is a little too funky/dancy. More basic exercise moves would be preferred for my kids' ages -- 4 and 6.
1,Not what I thought I was getting!,"The way this product description reads I thought it was two cd's but it was only one. For the price I do not think it was worth it. My nine year old tried it, but having to stop and start the next bit if you want to go longer than 10 minutes is annoying. I don't recommend it for older kids, but probably ok for smaller ones...if you are willing to pay that much for about 35 minutes! Unfortunately, I did. booo"
2,Worst workout,"I read good reviews that is why I purchased it for my8 year old grandaughter. I thought is a great thing to get her moving. It was so boring and very instructional, no music, movement was boring that she did not even want to watch it."
3,For my Grandson's,"I got this so I would have an age appropriate workout to do with my grandsons. The workouts are short, lots of varity and I thought fun. My grandsons are couch potatos and only one of the five would join me."
1,Goes nohwere,"The protagonist, Rob, makes Hamlet seem decisive--this book is 317 pages of Rob thinking to himself about whether or not to drink, whether or not his friends like him, and whether or not he'll get laid.Usually, after reading the first page of a book, I can tell if I would like it--with _Stag_, I was dead wrong. Save the 10 bucks and go to a bar, where Yes, you will drink; Yes, your friends will like you; and No, you won't get laid.Cheers."
5,A Great Listen for Young and Old,"This is an enchanting rendition of the tale of Scheherazade and her story of Sinbad and the Wizard Eagle. We bought it as a story CD for my 4-year-old son, and he asks to listen to it again and again. I am happy to hear it as many times as he asks because the orchestration is wonderful and Ann Rachlin's telling of the tale is charming and irresistible. What a wonderful way to introduce a kid to classical music! And what a great way to enjoy a favorite symphonic piece!"
4,Good product,"These wheels work great on my Z stand for rolling it out of the way when not using. The nuts necessary are NOT included, but it was easy enough to size the caster stems from the specialty hardware section at the local Ace Hardware and buy 4 lock washers and nuts. No big deal to me. I'm happy. Had nuts been included, I would have given 5 stars."
2,Dummies book better (surprisingly!),"This is one of those books that didn't need to be written because it adds nothing new versus the other books on the market. No glaring mistakes, but not as much value here as in 'Windows 98 Registry for Dummies'. Dummies (and I normally don't like them) covers same ground but has good CD, and foldout key map (I made mine into a mouse pad). Writing styles a matter of taste. Honeycutt is very much a Microsoft cheerleader (his Win2000 Pro book reads like one long ad). Dummies writer is more objective, wittier."
5,Great CD!,"Bought this for my 16 year old son, he loved it! I enjoy listening to it as well. Great Jazz music!"
2,"fun book, but not a great help",This book was created by two highschool students. The word lists are not challenging enough. I knew most of them already. This book won't help you get you a 700 on the SAT.
3,Disappointing,"This publication presents a facsimile copy of Volume 1 (of 3) on the subject (2nd edition published in 1839). I found this volume to contain more information on other Latin American provinces than particular experiences under Francia. It is possible that Volumes 2 & 3 concentrate more on the Francia period, however I have not been able to find a copy to date. As far as Volume 1 is concerned, unless you are seriously interested/studying deeper Latin American history, it is not a particularly enlightening book on Francia himself and I suggest looking elsewhere (e.g. ""Reign of De Francia"" by Rengger & Longchamps)."
5,Great read and informative,"After reading Have A Nice Day by Mick Foley I now can get a better understanding of the life of wrestlers. Mick starts his book by talking about the losing of his ear then goes on to explain how he first became interested in wrestling. Going on through his ECW, WCW, and WWF carrers. Explaining the reaction from fans his famly and other wrestlers about what he does. I think that Have A Nice Day is a great book for wrestling and non wrestling fans alike."
5,"Insightful, honest, Mick Foley in his finest moment","For every single person who has ever watched a wrestling show, for all those who profess their hate for sports entertainment, and for all those with no opinion either way, this is a must read. Mick Foley wins hearts over with his candor, with his wit, and with his shoot-style book. A masterpiece that keeps calling until you finish it, and then calling you back to see if what you think you read really was described in the pages. I am not afraid to say it, I, along with the rest of the dozens and dozens of his fans, love Mick Foley, best selling author and former 3 time WWF World Champion."
3,Have a Nice Day....,"I am a fan of Mick Foleys',and have been for a while. I thought the book was very well written,and I was intriged by his articulate manner. It seemed as though, Foley would just grab your attention and not let go, but when you would reach the climax of the story he was telling or the situation he was describing it would be a let down. I was very discourged by the ending. It seemed to just end. I still have some unanswered questions. It just kinda leaves you hanging, but not enough to make me wanna purchase volume 2."
4,Foley Puts Out A Better Book Than Expected,"Mankind has always been one of my favorite wrestlers, and I was excited to get my hands on his autobiography... And it turned out to be a lot better than I expected. It is a pretty well-written and sometimes amusing novel covering the life of Mick Foley from his backyard wrestling adventures to his experiences in the World Wrestling Federation. Of course, if you enjoy watching the WWF and even more so like Mankind in particular, this book is definitely worth the money. I also look foward to buying the Rock's autobiography, ""The Rock Says"", in the near future!"
5,THE BEST,"I read this book in three days . Mick foley's writing style is so personal , you fell like he's in the room telling you his story. It's the best book I've read in forever. Mick is a great person and has lived a wild life. He is the man. what else is to say but FOLEY IS GOD ! What are you waiting for BUY IT !"
5,Foley Rocks!,This Strong Island native is one of the dopest dudes ever. If you have the testicular fortitude you will read this book. Its really great to read how this dude who looks just like a regular joe on the street can become the hardcore legend. Its sad to see that his career is over. Much better than the Rock's book. But we will always remember Cactus Jack
5,View from one of the Dozens,"To be honest, I didn't know what to expect. I love Mankind as a wrestler, but I doubted his writing abilities. That is until now. If you like wrestling, I HIGHLY recommend this book."
1,Saps Are Us (aka TVidiots who like 3 ring illusion shows),"I didn't understand this book, nor its popularity, or the spectacle known as pro wrestling. I do credit him for having his mind intact after all of those evil brutal ""matches"", but who's going to respect a guy with as many bruises and scars as this guy? If you look up to a beer swigging boss abusing ""hero"", then Mr. Foley is probably the author for you."
3,"Great for Fans, So-So for Others","Very entertaining, and highly recommended, for fans of any or all of the professional wrestling federations. It is a ""must read"" among wrestlers themselves. This is not really the book, though, for those new to the ""sport"" who want to learn a lot about it; it is written largely for the ""in-crowd"" and assumes a knowledge of the people and situations discussed."
5,A Tale Of Sacrifice And A Great Man's Love Of Wrestling,"I have read many literary masterpieces, and can honestly say that Mick Foley's Have A Nice Day ranks up there with the best of them. This book shows how much Mick Foley loves the SPORT and his family. Mick Foley's book shows us just how much of a family man and kid at heart this great man really is. I recommend this book to any fan of Mick Foley or professional wrestling."
5,A book for everyone!,"I am not just a wrestling fan. I am a Mick Foley fan. His daredevil tactics and his three monikers in the world of wrestling have made me a fan. But, this book takes the cake. It is a showcase of true feelings, emotions, and offbeat, but touching humor. If you do not like wrestling, you are still going to love this book."
5,Unbelieveable!,"I bought this first thing this morning, was so engrossed that I missed class today, and almost missed work. I finished it tonight, and if you are a true wrestling fan this is a ""must read."" He wrote every word of it himself and has been in some of the best matches that I have ever seen (if you haven't seen Hell in a Cell, go do it!). I can only hope that he will be thought of as one of the most talented wrestlers of all time!"
5,A Great Read,"This book is great for anyone who wants to read a book about a guy who gave his blood, sweat and tears to do what he loved to do. At many times in this book I just burst out laughing. The stories of Mick Foley's 17 hour hitchhike to Madison Square Garden to see his hero wrestle really gave me new incite about how a little event can shape the rest of your life. After reading this I gained a new respect for Wrestlers and what they have to do to get the fans to like or hate them. So if you don't want to have a great time reading a great book that you'll probably enjoy (Wrestling and Nonwrestling fans alike) then don't buy this book."
5,AWESOME BOOK,This is a very good but graphic book. Mankind is one of the greatest wrestlers of the decade and has a very interesting life. It was nice to know what happened to him before he was famous and also what made him famous. This book is almost like an adventure story. I do not recemond this book for anybody under the age of 13 years old.
5,The Best Book I have ever Read!,I Purchased this book the first day it hit the shelves and I haven't been able to stop reading it since. It is by far the best book I have ever read in my life. I am a very big fan of the WWF and a very big fan of Mick Foley. The one thing I love the most abot this book is that he doesn;t hold anything back and tells you the truth about everything. The book never got boring from the first to the last page. You will not begin to believe all the sh%^ Mick Foley has been through. To sum this up I just want to say that this a a OUTSTANDING BOOK! GOOD JOB MICK!
5,GREAT BOOK,This book is one of the best i have ever read. Mankind talks about is old wrestling exprince and always says good things about the othe wrestlers if you like wrestling pick this book up
5,A CLASSIC!,"Of the glut of wrestlers autobiographys that flood the world, the one that started it all is far and away the best. I've owned this book for years and have read it dozens of times. It never gets any less enjoyable. If youre a wrestling fan, or even if you're not, do yourself a favor and pick this up right now."
4,"Tale of blood, sweat, and tears...","In this tale of blood, sweat, and tears you will find out about the life and career of pro-wrestler Mick Foley. Mick Foley has given everything to wrestling, including his ear!! He has been involved in wrestling for nearly fifteen years and has become on of the most well known people in sports entertainment. In this book you will find everything you've looked for in an autobiography. Hand-written from seven hundred pages of notebook paper, ""Have a Nice Day"" will provide you with several exciting stories full of blood and stories full of love. Not only does it involve wrestling, but also stories about life in general. Although some parts may make you a little sick to your stomach, in the end you will find a place in your heart for the light-hearted Mick Foley."
4,very entertaining,"although i never followed mick foley's carrer as cactus jack when he worked for WCW, i must admit after reading his book that i have a new found respect for the man and his different characters. what i most enjoyed about the book was the honesty about professional wrestling. mick never shied away from the fact that the matches are scripted with the final outcome decided before the bell even rings. i now have a much more favorable view of professional wrestling as a whole knowing that it is entertainment plain and simple. yes the blood is real and the injuries as well, for this mick must be especially commended for going above and beyond in his chosen profession to entertain any and all who purchase a ticket or tune into the USA network to watch him in action. i recommed the book not only for wrestling fans, but for anyone who enjoys a well written story as well. for me it's a book that i will read again."
5,A Must Have for the Wrestling Fan and Non-Fan!,"Not being a ""die-hard"" wrestling fan, I was eager to receive Mick's Book. To say the least, I was impressed.Man Kind gives a great history of his profession to the fan and non fan alike. Most readers should be able to relate to some aspect of his life.Without a doubt, Mick Folley is a World Champion in the ring and behind the pen."
5,Unbelievable,A typical non-wrestling fan thinks that wrestling is a joke and that every thing that is done is fake. Well for you that is not a believer that wrestling has reality then take a look at this book and become a believer. I have never read a book that had so much heart and glory put into it. This book has inspired me to follow my dreams and not let others put me down because of what tose dreams are. I thank you Mick Foley for writing the most inspirational book of all time. Mick you are the author of the year by far.
5,One of the best books ever written.,"I don't read alotta books, Infact I don't even like to read, but let me just say that this is the best book I've ever read, and probably will ever read, go out and buy it, it is worth the money, and worth the read."
3,too indepth on wrestling matches,"This book was ok, but I got tired of reading about his matches over and over. I guess I wanted more about the present and not step by step on every match. I guess that was the only let down!"
5,"THE MAN , THE LEGEND",WHAT IS BEST ABOUT THIS BOON IS NO GHOST WRITERS! FINALLY SOMEONE WRITES THIER ON THOUGHTS.
5,Have a Nice Day : A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks,I like the book very much. I like chapter 23. It was sure great
5,awesome,"this book has to be by far, the best autobiography I have ever had the pleasure of reading. Mick Foley is hilarious and ranks up there with Terry Funk as one of the best ""hardcore"" wrestlers ever. Everyone should read this book"
5,Tour De Force,"This book is truly one of the greats in english literature. Melville, Dickens, Poe, Updyke, Foley."
5,a book for all types,"this book is excellent. it is not only for a wrestling fan, but anyone who believes in believing in yourself and your dreams. it is the story about 'heart' and where it can take you. it show how one man beat all the odds and held the coveted prize of his youth, the wwf title. the book is also hilarous beyond belief. foley is truly one of a kind, or shall i say 'mankind'."
4,Mankind is A great wrestler and author,I thought this book was hilarious and was heart- warming at the same time and worth the 13.00 you pay. Only two flaws in the book are a bad ending and he gives you too many names to remember throughout the book.
5,Good stuff,"This book isn't just about wrestling, its about Mick's life in his very own words. Indeed, he has much to say, but he does it in such a way that its not only real, admirable and interesting, but very humourous as well.I've got to say that Mick did a very good job of writing the book his way in his own words. I was hooked on his simple, yet absorbing tale of blood and sweat. Compared with the Rock's book, I've got to say that this one has definitely more depth and variety to it as Mick has been in the business longer and have paid more dues than most wrestlers nowadays.My recommendation is that if you're an avid fan of wrestling or Mick, then you just got to have this book. Mick surprisingly expresses very good taste in bringing humour to his story, and there's no doubt you'll have a good laugh reading as you go through his book!!"
5,mankind,When I bought this book I did not know what to expect. I had seen Mick on tv for several years but I did know he was so smart and funny. This book had me laughing from start to finish. It is a must read for any wrestling fan and also to anyone who enjoys a good read and laugh. He has proven himself to be an incredibly brilliant author. I highly recommend this enjoyable journey. You will not be disappointed. He is truly an american jewel.
5,MandKind Have A Nice Day Best Book I have read Yet,This book is the best book I have ever read. It tells the indepth story of not only Mankind but the true story of Mick Foley and what he had to do to become and achieve what he is today in the world of Sports-entertainment.The best thing about this book is that it was written from Mick Foley and came right from his hart.I recommend this book to Wrestling fans and Non-wrestling fans of all ages because it is not mainly about professional wrestling.It is about a man who has paid his dues to become what he is today.
4,Have a Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks,"This was Mick Foley's first book and it is great! At times he goes into a lot of detail, perhaps too much. It was interesting to learn about his childhood, early career, marriage and family. Also, very interesting what he has to say about other wrestlers. A must read for a wrestling fan."
5,A well deserved five stars,"Yep, he did it. I didnt expect anything less of great when I heard about Mick Foley publishing a book written by himself. When I sat down to read this 500 + page monster, I had no idea how much I would end up enjoying. Foley has done some incredible things in his career, and he writes about them beautifully in this book. Like I allways say, anyone who thinks there's no pain in wrestling? Make them read the back of the dust cover for this book.This is packed with great information, stories and experinces and it was just a great experince to read it. I was perticularly amazed with how well-done the Owen Hart chapter was. The problem with the Rock's book is that virtually all the second half of it was in-character rant. The first part of the book was great and packed with information about his history and family. But this is just page after page of flawless writing. This is one book that has *deserved* it's spot on the new york times listing."
5,Mick Foley's genius is limitless,"Have a Nice Day is a must read, and not just for wrestling fans. Mick's life is an example of daring to dream and then following that dream no matter what. Mick is an inspiration who has paid his dues and reaped the praise his battered body endures. READ THIS BOOK AND UNDERSTAND WHY MICK FOLEY IS KING!!!!!"
5,What I Got From Foley,"Whether you like Mick Foley or not he is one of the greatest wrestlers in the business. How many people do you know that could write a 500+ page book on their life. Having not nearly as many injuries as he has. He is a true icon in society today, he fought through the good and the bad to rise to the top. Foley wrote one of the greatest books on wrestling and his life when he wrote this one."
4,Foley is God,"How many times have we seen the slogan ""Foley is God""? Well, we all know that Mick isnt God, but Mick is as close as you can get. This book is worth the read indeed, its big, fat and full of meat to sink your teeth into. Mick goes into detail about his teen years, the 'Dude Love' years, and shoots on a few people he has met along the years, including Ric Flair and Mil Mascaras. Worth the read, if not just for the funny stories Mick has to say. You dont have to be a wresrtling fan to enjoy this book, which is attratctive and colorful. My advice - buy it!"
5,Most inspiring book ever,"I have been a fan of pro wrestling for sometime, but in all my years I have never met a man so dedicated to work and his family than Mick Foley. I love how Mick makes you feel that he is your best friend. This book is not for the sqwemish because he goes into full detail of his Japeanese death matches and his classic HELL IN A CELL matchup with THE UNDERTAKER. What ever you want to call him,Mankind,Cactus Jack,or Dude Love. if you buy this book you will not even dought that he is the Hardcore legend. This book is a book that you will read over and over."
4,Enjoyable,"Well, it certainly isn't a book that is going to change my life, but it certainly was a book that was very enjoyable to read."
4,"A good, fun read","I'm a wrestling fan, but more importantly, I'm a Mick Foley fan. Mr. Foley's exploits and adventures over the course of his eventful career made a sixteen hour flight to Asia fly by. Having said that, I'm also a fan of well-written books, and this is, unfortunately, not one of them. It's clear that the book may have benefitted from the work of a ghost-writer, but at the same time, an autobiography from a man an straightforward as Mr. Foley would have seemed disingenuous with one. In short, this book is an open and honest look at the business of wrestling (although Mr. Foley skirts the issue of genuine heat between Owen Hart and Steve Austin), that is at times rambling, but nonetheless extremely enjoyable."
5,Greatest book ever made,"I going to get the book soon but i know this book is great , a most read for anyone who loves to read."
4,Intriguing inside look into the secretive world of wrestling,"Good read. Mick Foley is one of the most dangerous, dare-devil, professional wrestlers in the history of the business. Off the mat he is a typical family guy. This book gives the dozens and dozens of his fans a great insight into his life."
3,MICK FOLEY was cool,"Hey everyone l thought this book was okay but to tell you the truth theres this one part in the book where he's in WCW and that gets real boring.This is nothing more than his wrestling career anyways it starts off w/ his teenage days then it takes off, other than that it gets real interesting back stage at his shows.Some parts are disturbing cause he talk about his..."
5,This book is killer.,"This book is one of, if not the best, books I have ever read. Mick's detailed accounts of all his travels and tribulations have pushed the meaning of 'biography' to a new level. This is absolutely a recommended read."
4,From someone who's not a wrestling fan...,"First of all, let me just say that I'm not a wrestling fan. As a matter of fact, I rather dislike this form of entertainment.However, I do like to read authors who have a knack for telling stories. And Mick Foley certainly does. As a matter of fact, this book has given me newfound respect for the practitioners of this entertainment form.The only negative points to it are that it sometimes get a little tedious in the play-by-play description of matches, and lots of terms are specific to wrestling and are not explained (perhaps a glossary for the non-initiated would be a good idea?).Mick Foley is one tough SOB, and also a great storyteller. I had a hard time putting the book down.I'll never see wrestling in the same light, that's for sure!"
3,ripcity28,good insights. the only problem with this book is not enough insights and to many blow by blow descriptions of what seems like every match that he ever had. i like to watch the matches not read about them. i do realize hes giving insights of what really happens in the ring. im just saying that i got it after the 1st 2 or 3 descriptions.
5,"Great work Mike! Be proud of it, oh, Be very proud of it!","Mankind is an amazing man. From Fight death Matchs in Japan, to fighting for the World Wrestling Federation, I find it amazing how this man is still walking. But he is, and he lived to tell us the story right here, in his book, which for me speaks a great deal of the man. Mike Foley is called a ""GOD"" by the fans, and when you read this book, you will soon find out why. He is for me, without a doubt, one of the bravest men I have ever heard off. Also, this book for me is a must. Anyone who is a Foley fan has got to buy this book right away! Well done Foley, now all I can say is bring on The Rock Says!"
5,Mick Foley...Best Selling Author,"I have been a wrestling fan for well over 15 years now. There has never been a good selection of wrestling books available. The books that did come available never delved into the wrestler's real lives, just the characters they portray. Foley's book is a must read for all wrestling fans. It touches on his training as well as the backstage politics that all wrestling companies have. I was a Foley fan before. After reading his book and what he went through in his career, I have more respect than ever for him."
4,If you read one wrestling book this year...,"I recieved this book as a joke, but started reading it and it was actually good! I'm probably the one non-wrestling fan who has read this book, but hey, if there's another one of us out there and you happen upon this book, it is more entertaining than you might imagine."
5,The best damn book ever,Addicting like crack... and almost as healthy if you try some of the stuff he did.A wonderful book written by a man who deserves all the credit in the world.Witty to say the least.All the jokes are laugh out loud funny.Highly recommended.This review isn't saying anything new but it's the truth.You don't have to like wrestling or even reading but you'll love this book like no other.
5,He Suffers for Pro Wrestling's Sins,"The point isn't whether wrestling is or isn't fake. I watch it -- and I love it -- because, aside from the political arena, it's the closest thing we've got to the modern-day Theater of the Absurd.Foley will never win a Pulitzer for his prose, and yes, the online grade of his writing (""I was quite..."" ""He was somewhat..."" ""They were very..."") wears on the nerves. But it's the story you're reading for, and it's a story you get. I've been one of the dozens (AND DOZENS!) of Mankind's fans for a while now. This book helps remind me why."
5,GREAT BOOK,The book of Mankind is a good book.It tells lots of jokes about his friends.The book also talks about his kids and it shows pictures of him with his kids.It talks about all the injurys he has sustained in his career.It tells about how long he has been in the sport and where he frist started to wrestle.
4,I Guess a Wrestler Can Be a Writer,"I actually got this book as a gift, but when I first heard about it, I wasn't planning on buying it. I love this book. Foley is a great writer. It takes a look at his career as a wrestler and at his family life. Before I read this book, I never really thought about the WWF Superstars off the mat. They actually lead exciting and sometimes really tough lives. My friend read the book and she liked it. She wasn't even into the WWF. Buy it."
5,Great just what I was looking for,"Always trying to get my kids motivated to move their bodies instead of moving in front of the computer. They liked it, it was fun and now sometimes I catch them putting it on with their friends for fun! Very happy."
1,65 Energy Blasts for Kids Fitness,"I bought this for my grandchildren who are 9 and 4 years old. They didn't like it at all. When I was over there yesterday I tried watching it with my 4 year old grandson. We were both so bored with it. He lost interest (as did I) after about two minutes so I don't know if it got any better. I would hope so but if it doesn't grab their attention right away, it's not going to work! How disappointing since the reviews I read were so good. What a waste of money!"
3,Quick Energy Blasts,"This product was very disappointing. Each energy last approximately 90 seconds. I thought that this video would be more similar to the Fit Kids Classroom Workout DVD that Judy does. Judy introduces herself between each and every ""energy blast"", this is very annoying. It is hard to keep students engaged and their heart rate up in a physical education class. Perhaps this is better suited to use at home. However, the vocabulary and health tips that are included are pretty cool."
5,Great Debut,As many reviewers have pointed out this is Mr. Ward's first full length Trek novel. He wrote two stories in the SCE series that was excellent. Dealing with the Defiant from TOS. You can tell from that two stories he knew his Trek well. When I heard about this novel I knew I had to get it. I wasn't disappointed. Excellent story with Kirk and Sulu doing a covert operation with Koloth from the episode Trouble with Tribbles. They have to rescue Starfleet prisoners before they are eliminated. As some have pointed out it has humor and action. The ending is pretty impressive when Kirk explains his feeling about his son's death. Very strong stuff. Once again great novel and they should have let Dayton Ward write the TOS edition of Gateway!!
4,Rare and wonderful recordings,"The first part of this disc is the earliest recording session of a full orchestra, the BSO, in 1917. My college music library had some of these sides, and I remember their clarity. It's good to have more of them. The second part is the BSO, with Koussevitzky, in 1929, playing what was then some pretty avant-garde music. They're great, and we even get some outtakes. This disc is a clear recording of two great early conductors and a fabulous orchestra. The description of how the 1917 recording session was accomplished is fascinating."
4,"Great, yet lacking","When I saw 19 stories on tape, read by Ray Bradbury, written by Bradbury, I rushed to get my copy. Do not get me wrong--I love the tapes. However, there is something lacking in his tone of voice that can cause one to possibly fall asleep or simply drift away when one should be paying absolute attention to the story. I suppose part of my dissapointment comes from the fact that we all read a story a certain way, and sometimes it is dissapointing to see how the author meant for it to be read. It is also enlightening, however, to be able to find new meaning in his words as he originally intended. I will definitely keep these tapes for a lifetime, and cannot wait to use them in the classroom."
1,factory seconds,"we have used 100's of this size and type of bottle for 7-8 years and normally order large quantities from 1 supplier. We needed a small fillin order and ordered from this company. Mistake. Bottles appear to be seconds, in every case, somehow warped or misshapen. Shipping charges are excessive. Not happy"
5,Perfect!,"I store all my little...things... in these bottles: teeth I've lost, tiny, TINY origami, etc., etc., and they're perfect for all the tiny sentiments I like to keep."
4,Primative yet spellbinding!,I am Kenneth Branagh's biggest fan so I set out to see and own every one of his movies. This one threw me a little bit when I realized it was taped in a play format but it also captivated me and I enjoyed every second of it! It was almost like it was completely adlibbed and it was amazing to watch all the characters play off each other perfectly.
2,"Dreamtheater's First Album is, unfortunately, their worst","Dreamtheater's debut album, When Dream and Day Unite, is plauged with bad production and an awful singer. The only saving grace of this album is the rousing instrumental Ytse Jam (Majesty backwards, DT's original bandname) which generally sounds better live anyway.Dreamtheater for me really began with James Labrie joining the band, their second, and hoefully final, singer in their Second album, Images and words. James Labrie is the real voice of dreamtheater, and the band's later masterpiece albums make this one look clumsy in comparison."
4,The beginning of a Dream...,"If this rare 1989 album had featured James LaBrie instead of Mr. Dominici on vocals, it would have been, and still would be; a huge favorite. The music, though sometimes not mixed well, is remastered in this limited set. The trio of Petrucci, Myung and Portnoy already were playing swift and diverse instrumental-ised material, and the album is very well done.I have a ""LIVE"" bootleg of the album and some 'outtakes' with James LaBrie, including the not included on this disc ""To Live Forever"", a song featured on the 1991 VHS ""Live in Tokyo"" concert, a superb concert promoting ""Images and Words."" The European release ""Live at the Marquee"" features a couple of the songs from ""When Dream and Day Unite.""DT fans likely have this CD already, but this limited addition is a nice addition to your collection! Of note: The playing of Mike Portnoy is not nearly as insane as on ""Six Degrees."" John Petrucci displays some nice fretwork. But John Myung and Kevin Moore are superb. Enjoy!"
4,This is a book about skelatins,"My favorite part is when they ate, all the food fell out of their bones. Review by a 7 year old."
4,Kick boxing for beginners,"This workout is kick boxing, is not so bad, besides if you like to kick and punch this dvd is for you."
1,"The Bright Country:A Fisherman's Return to Trout,Wild Water and Homself","Mr. Middleton is in a much darker period of his writing and life at the time of his writing this book and though he still writes well, the tone takes on a darker shade than The Earth is Enough or On the Spine of Time which are cherished pieces in my collection."
3,"My opion, there's only 3 really pretty girls","This dvd just shows them naked and alittle kissing. Nothing more. And my opion is there's only 3 girls that are pretty. If I knew what I know now, I would have not bought dvd."
4,Want to watch some Thai vixens???,"Gotta agree these chicks are totally hot! But you dudes have to check out ""Wild Girls Thailand""- gorgeous babes taking off those bikini tops and lettin it all hang out on the beach in Thailand! These 2 american guys actually went to thailand and filmed it there."
5,GREAT book!!!,This book is one of the best that talks about Shannon Miller and her start with gymnastics and her years of rising to the top and training and competing with injuries. It is a must for people who like reading about gymnastics and Shannon Miller!
1,Annoying at best,"I bought this book many years ago, and ended up throwing it across the room And Then ripping it up, Which was far more therapeutic and useful than the book itself! I found it patronising, unhelpful, and deeply annoying. This woman clearly hasn't got a clue about depression, and probably never suffered from it herself. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone, Except for fire kindling!"
1,Helpful only for mild depression,"I think this book was damaging for people with chronic depression, as it suggests that you can just pull yourself up by your bootstraps and, with the help of God, get over it. Harmful rubbish."
1,"Depression, The Way Out Of Your Pain",Dot Rowe has portrayed a picture of Depressin that is purely text book and there seems to be little idea of the true pain suffered by depression sufferers. I would not reccomend this book to anyone who needs help in coping with depression.
1,5-star reviews are fake,"Most if not all the positive reviews for Rowe's books are fake. I don't want to tip off Ms. Rowe, but if you look at the positive reviews you'll spot the pattern.Try sorting by lowest-rated first."
3,good overview but lacks solid advice,"As a former sufferer of clinical depression, my most effective tool for recovery was self-help books. Although I would say that Dorothy Rowe writes in a very creative and understanding manner about the nature of depression and the binds which keep us in it, the book doesn't really venture beyond the abstract. Unlike the excellent ""Overcoming Depression"" by Paul Gilbert or ""Feel The Fear And Do It Anyway"" by Susan Jeffers, there is actually very little advice on how to practically integrate these ideas into your life, as well as how to cope on a day to day basis with the condition."
4,Title Track,"The album is pretty good. I admit that I do not love all the songs on this album, but it is well worth purchasing just to get the song ""Velveteen"". This is one of those songs that just seem to mesmerize. Wendy James sings the song with one of the male band members. It is an erotic song with a powerful tempo. I waited for this album for at least a month. It was worth the wait."
3,"Very interesting, lacks music content","this dvd was pretty cool but was not at all what i expected it to be, it is basically a documentary on the boxed boys and their travels with some of their artists, if you are curious on the global underground scene then this is for you, but if you are looking for music then this is definitely not what you are looking for"
2,Over intellectualized and badly organized,Book is highly cerebral without the intuition or wit to illuminate. The organization of information is also disconcerting. I would not recommend this book.
5,Everything you wanted to know about religion,This book will tell you everything you want to know about religion. It is a good book for students at any level. It is a textbook.
3,Thorough read for students,Mr. Partridge offers a strong analysis of the world's religion which any student of culture will find helpful. Our student used this book in two courses and she found it very useful.
3,Interesting,"This book is the textbook for a class. There are various maps and a timeline that are very helpful. Book will be easy to use as a reference when the class is over because of indexes, layout, etc. (In other words it is ""user friendly."""
4,Good Reference Book!,"Good reference book with timelines, maps, data and great photos! I'm sure I'll refer to this many times."
2,show piece or field ready?,"As far as show knives are concerned, this is a beautiful knife, but it's praise stops there. Bill Bagwell, in his own book, carefully warns against a knife made of stainless steel, yet this knife,with his name on it, is made of stainless steel. It looks wonderfull, lots-a-luck putting an edge on it. If you were to carry it in the field and you needed to sharpen it you would have to take a day back at camp with a stone. I should have researched it more but I assumed(yea,I know what it means)that Bagwell wouldn't allow a knife with his name on it to be made of stainless, I guess you just can't trust the writers to practice what they preach."
3,"Nice book, but it's mostly pictures","This book is by the same people who put out The Encyclopedia of TV Game Shows. While that book is very complete with info, this book is basically like a high school yearbook. Lots of pictures, some vary rare and unique. Just about all the hosts prior to 2005 are here, including Todd Newton and Kennedy, from the Game Show Network (GSN). The text is primarily little tidbits relating to the people in pictures on that page. I found one inaccuracy. On page 48, it says Three on a Match debuted on NBC in 1973, when it was actually 1971. Other than that, the book has a lot of fun facts, and is a good collector's item for any game show fan."
3,The Ultimate TV Gave Show Book,Book seems to concentrate too much on the very early game shows. Would've been nice if it spanned the generations more evenly to include more readers.
4,Good Book - Only One Flaw,"This is a good compilation of information about TV game shows, including lists, fun facts and tons of pictures. The only flaw is that some of the pictures cut off the very top, meaning that some people's heads are not showing. I suspect that is a publishing error. Still, a very good book."
1,thats enuff,alrite enuff wit the compilations y dont these dogs come out wit more solos instead b'? im just playin this didnt even come out yet im just foolin' itll probably be ill peace
5,A CD that will get you going and wanting more,I saw this Chicago-land band about three years ago now. I bought the CD and it is one of my favorites. This band is fun to watch and listen to. You will shack shack!
3,Non Fiction,"A short mathematical tech detailing mathematical techniques that can be used when ordinary regression analysis is not appropriate, valid, or will just not work. The examples given are generally looking at a social science point of view, but the explanation and description is clear and is easily followed for application in other areas."
3,Same plot different characters,"I realise that Francine Craft books have very similar plots , (this is the third book that I have read).1. The characters find love second time around2. Hero was always in love with heroine despite having married someone else3. Hero or Heroine is either a divorcee or widower4. Heroine's life is always in danger5. One must have a murder victim in the storyOk having the above as the standard FC book this story is quite a good one, I found the murder mystery more interesting than the romance, but the romance between the characters was lovely to see deveoping. This is a connecting story to the Steel series"
5,A Must Read,"This is one of those rare books that makes you want to be in the text. As I was reading this book I really felt that I was in the scene, fighting Kirilin, and devising plans. Christina Woods really makes these characters come to life. I was a fan of the previous series about Nearra and her friends, but this series -particularly this book- was far supirior. The way Woods created the scene was itriging."
3,Okay Haydn but lacking in charm,"If there is one element required for a good Haydn performance it has to be charm. The music must sing and make you smile. If it doesn't make you smile, it is cold Haydn. Here you have a great orchestra but a conductor too serious for this music. Look elsewhere."
4,very durable and cute,"We got this one before Santa brought the big Pirate Ship.This littel one is actually a bathtime buddy.Unfortunately, little people have holes so the water gets in.The boat sinks since it is not designed to be in the bathtub. But that is where our kids use it.Hold up really well. And is like every little people toy, fun to play with, look at and have around. Durable, easy to clean and to store away and individually or together with the big Pirate ship it makes a fun toy to bring alone in the car, or even bathtub, or just to play daily with it in your home.The price is good."
1,piece of worthless crap,"i loved this product at first, it was the perfect length chain though the dog tag charm appears much larger than it really is in real life. i also loved the how it could wrap around your neck twice...but when it arrived that was also not the case. but even that i could deal with- the freaking thing broke the very first night i wore it...the clasp, which was not a lobster clasp as advertised but the traditional army style clasp, fell off completely like i mean it just all broke...do not purchase from this vendor ever again"
1,Poetry from a fraud,"While there is no doubt that Dana Shuster has a talent for poetry, it must be acknowledged that she is a complete and total fraud. She never served in Vietnam, never served in the military, and never was a nurse. If this were fiction that would be fine, but she claimed to have served in Vietnam, witnessed the horrors of a Vietnam operating room, came home and suffered from Agent Orange and PTSD. The problem is that none of it is true! She made the whole thing up. Thus given the fact that she lied about serving in Vietnam, and that the poetry is based on utter fiction, I have to give it one star. I would give it zero stars if I could."
3,interesting but not that funny,"I purchased this movie after seeing previews for it on another DVD. The previews made it look like a funny movie about dating. It is really not that funny. The basic story is about a woman with no meaningful relationships beyond that with her beloved dog who struggles in life after her dog suddenly dies. During the movie she struggles with relationships with her male boss, her male neighbor, and a male friend she meets at the Humane society. Her biggest challenge is filling the void left in her heart after the loss of her dog.I found the movie interesting and not boring. It is funny in spots but not as funny as it could have been. I am an animal lover, so I could identify with some of the emotion in the movie as could most anyone who has pets. The movie is worth renting, but I am not sure it is worth purchase."
3,Kleenex clutching chick flick,"I sadly have to admit the water works started early in this movie for me. If you are a pet lover, and are close with your animals, you'll empathize with the lead character's loss of her pet. As she wanders through her routine and self-exploration post trama, we follow her through her breakdown that leads to her breaking out of this shell she trapped herself in.i enjoyed the movie. great cast. A little too heavy with the PETA plugging, but they made their point and i found it entertaining along the way. I mostly felt sad for the character, and chuckled a few times."
2,Definitely NOT hilarious!!,"Don't be fooled by the review on the box. This movie has a few funny moments, but overall it's a sad tale of a lonely woman who becomes unglued after her dog dies. I don't think the director knew what mood to make the movie--humorous, satirical, dramatic?? So, to me its tone is uneven. Shannon's performance is fine, and the cast of supporting characters is very strong, especially Laura Dern."
2,Needs a cinematic pooper-scooper.....,"A ""dog"" of a movie ... Woof! Woof!!Peggy Spade's (played by Molly Shannon) beloved beagle dies and thereafter she descends into a dysfunctional madness and obsession with other abandoned dogs and animal cruelty. I am an ardent dog owner/lover, but this is a disturbing portrayal of a whacked out PETA-type who embezzles money, lies and essentially destroys her life in order to save impounded dogs. Hello??? She treats the people around her shabbily but reserves her empathy for canines.This DVD has fleas... Dig a hole and bury this misguided movie faster than a dog would hide a bone...."
1,Weird and sad,"Slow and quirky, weird and sad (to see someone disintegrate before your eyes). Far too many four-second shots of Shannon grimacing. Woman without social life becomes animal activist ... but it feels like you've gone nowhere. There might be some hidden meaning for the existence of the seemingly useless 90% of the movie, but to a plain old moviewatcher like me, it's boooooring, folks, unless you liked that horribly slow movie with Bill Murray, ""Lost in Translation.""Animal lovers ... this movie will make you look like kooks (unless, of course, you're PETA, in which case you are indeed)."
3,Kind of weird movie,"This was a weird movie. It was about what I think of people who are Vegetarian and vegan. I would suggest renting it.Amazon Unbox is awesome, easy to use, pay and watch movies. I have had NO problems, and I do mean NONE! Everyone that I have heard that has had problems is mac users. So maybe they should learn to read and complain to the right people. It is not Amazons fault that apple did not release their DRM code. apple again has shoot themselves in the foot. I never get bored hearing news about how apple has fallen. LOL LOL LOL"
1,Dog poop,"A top 3 worst movie of all time! This movie never went anywhere. Stayed stuck in neutral, never got any traction. Sooooo boring. The people who were involved in the making of this movie can't possibly think they made a good movie."
1,Leaves something to be desired,The Beagle was cute. The story line was a little too over the edge for my taste.
1,Just because Molly Shannon is in it doesn't mean its funny,I came here just to warn people about this movie. Its not funny. Its sick.Her dog gets poisoned and she gets a new one. The new one kills a dog in a wheelchair. She tries to kill her neighbor. I expected better from Molly Shanoon .The box says its a lighthearted movie. WRONGShe tries to take her niece to watch farm animals be killed. BEWARE of the movie.
1,Confused and confusing,"This was neither a comedy (in either the classical or in the modern sense) nor a true philosophical treatise, but attempts to be both ... and as a result, achieved neither. I hated it since it left me without a laugh, a feeling of having learned anything about the characters or myself, nor even the slightest sense of a thrill. It was utterly bathic."
2,Not a comedy...,"Though the acting is good and story is pretty interesting, the ending is weak and it is not funny. I rented it thinking I was getting a ""Best in Show"" type of movie. I, too, am an animal lover, but do not like sad movies and I was not prepared."
2,I wanted to love it..,"I love the actors in this film, which was kind of why I was so disappointed in it. It was slow, depressing, and showed an unrealistic portrayal of a woman going INSANE over animal rights and devolving into a crazed idiot who hordes animals and throw her life away to go on a protest circuit. I could identify with Peggy's love of animals, but I couldn't figure out what they were trying to say about animal lovers as there's a lot of mixed messages throughout the movie. I'm not sure the makers of this film knew what they were trying to say here. Ultimately, this ended up being a boring film about a pathetic woman. So much comedic talent wasted here."
4,It does what it is supposed to!,"I have had one of these in my home shop for a few years now. Although it is sturdy and mounted in a very handy position, I find that I just don't use it all that much. All I really keep on mine is the chuck key. Since my drill bits do double duty in my heavy duty hand-held drill, I keep them in a more portable container, not on this tray.Despite all that though, it is worth the money and it does just what you would want it to do!"
4,"Great Idea, a little cheap, but overall a solid A","Holds on Drill press post with a hose clamp, plastic table top, but does the job. I have had over 30lbs on mine (don't recommend more then ten, at lesat on mine) but it did lean. I would prefer a little higher quality, but for the price I am happy."
2,New and Improved?,"Hudson 96302E Comando 2 Gallon Sprayer Galvanized SteelBuyer beware! Package arrived with ""New and Improved"" sticker affixed to the outside of the product box. I thought great! Until I opened the box to see the metal spray valve pictured on the box and ad is now made of plastic! The reason I purchased this product was the metal valve. I was very disappointed that I was mislead by the ad description."
2,Get a B&G,"This thing's OK. But it's plastic. Eventually its going to break. My wand snapped above the handle when I was tapping it to try to clear up the spray pattern. I kept buying cheap to mid-level sprayers like this one, and finally bought a B&G sprayer. It hurt to pay that much, but it will outlast me. . ."
2,Mostly Metal Sprayer Works OK,"What it is: garden sprayer (pesticide, or herbicide, etc) with a nice metal tank and wand. The valve, and pump mechanism, however, are plastic.I've had this sprayer for over a year. I've used it a lot of times - more than the few poly sprayers it has out-lived, combined. The tank is galvanized, which means, if you rinse it after use and store it dry, it'll last a long time.The sprayer easily handles 1.25 gallons of mix (capacity: 2 gal), and the sprayer head works quite well.The valve mechanism is plastic, and literally broke in half today, I had to unscrew the pump to release pressure while the contents sprayed about. If it had a metal valve, the sprayer would still be in service."
5,Hudson 96302E Comando 2 Gallon Sprayer Galvanized Steel review,"open boxwas like this is a little heavy.doesnt have a de-pressurize button . you have to turn it upside down an let out the air,works great solid sprayer"
2,Junk,"The cheap plastic wand is pure junk, I bought two of these sprayers, the gray handle literally fell off the first unit and the second won't spray. There are better sprayers out there for about the same or a little more money."
1,About broke 2 of my toes....,"I pull on the handle to slide out the sprayer from the box and as soon as it clears the box, the damn handle assembly comes out of the container and the container drops right on two of my small toes. Im surprised it didnt break my toes, but it did slice them open. Blood all over the place and two of my nails that are going to fall off. Not to mention the excrutiating pain for a few hours I had."
4,Not the last of the original 3 but a great performance,"This is a great cd, but the Editorial Reviews/Album Details section on the amazon page which credit this as ""The Last Ever Live Performance from the Original Lineup that Includes all Three Wilson Brothers on Stage Together"" is false. I myself saw the Beach Boys do a new years eve concert at the forum in Los Angeles on 12/31/1980 and can attest with assurance that Carl, Brian and Dennis (the 3 Wilson Bros.) were all on stage and all performing for the whole show. In addition there were many other shows in the early 80's (I've seen 15 Beach Boy related concerts in my lifetime) which included all three. There were times with Brian missing and a brief time with Carl missing and Dennis had yet to be ""kicked out"" so there were times when all three were there. Regardless this is a great sounding cd, but one should be aware of that false claim."
3,Hangman OK,I originally saw another version of this one. I bought this for my 85 yo mother to help retain mental alertness. The product arrived as stated in OK condition. It had been used. I think it would be nice if they gave a clue as to the topic of each page so you know what words to be guessing. This just is a free for all. Not too impressive.
1,I see a lottery promotion handed to my kids,"Scratch & solve Hangman i think is a perfect tool to get your kids to become atracted to gambler as a adult, and we do not need more promotion i think is a real problem when you look a this game sure is interesting in your house in the car but as en adult do not pay off scratch off lottery ticket does it. So that what you will play as an adult and if you did not know it is a real problem out there. So bcfull what you wish for."
3,Great fun for my daughter but terrible smell!,"I thought the colors were very vibrant and the dough was very soft and pliable. My daughter had a lot of fun with this ""dough"". However, I will not purchase again as I found the smell to be very unpleasant. I am going to look for a modeling clay or play-dough that does not emit a foul odor. I think I will try Pkolino this time as it is made in Europe instead of China."
5,Hetty is Ab-Fab,"I was curious about this series. I had only heard about it and had never seen a broadcast. So I was skeptical. But I had enjoyed the Mrs. Bradley Mysteries and others who had enjoyed those had suggested these. I am so glad I took the plunge. Hetty is an absolutely fabulous character who refuses to take a back seat at the age of 60. Determined to ""matter,"" she forges ahead and finds herself in the middle of a mystery. Before she knows it, she's taking on investigations as a profession, with a young man whom she turns from a latent shoplifter into a crack investigator's partner. Patricia Routeledge is thoroughly believable and adorable in the role. I am looking forward to the next set of DVD's on this series. I must say, it's refreshing to see a late 20th Century mystery (as opposed to the usual Golden Age era) that is more logic puzzle than CSI. These days there's far too much forensics and far too little charm!"
4,A very good buy!,The characters and plots are all really good. A good series to watch and to own. The opening title scene has got to be one of the best. You also get the bonus features including an interview with Patricia Routledge and more.
5,Fantastic!,I've been waiting for this to come out for a very long time and I have to say I'm very pleased with the series. Patricia Rutledge is brilliant while Dominic Monaghan is absolutely hilarious.
1,not ALL REGION rated,The information on Amazon shows that this is meant to be played in all regions. I live in region 2 (Japan) and the DVD will not play. My DVD player says it is incompatible with the region. Don't buy this DVD if you live in region 2.I had to give a rating for the review to post. I don't know whether I will like it or not since I am unable to view it.
4,"Perfect for fans suffering from ""Idol Withdrawl""","That's right, finally a perfect DVD, covering (some) of the best and worst of seasons 1-4. The worst is pretty good, but it can get pretty annoying. In the best disc, ""Cuddles"" was very funny (also a LITTLE disturbing) but I think the Simon Expose from season 4 should have been on it. It's cool to see how American Idol changed from seasons 1-4, like the stage, etc. Anyway, it's a pretty awesome DVD, and if you love American Idol, buy this today!And tune in to Fox on January 17th at 8 pm to catch the premire of AMERICAN IDOL SEASON 5!!!"
4,I love A.I,"What can I say, but it had most of my favorite wierdos. My family and I watched it and it enjoyed it."
4,"The worse, the better",There are some absolute comedic gems on this collection. When I watch idol I want to see the worst of the worst and this didn't disappoint.I did find Paula's commentary to be tacked-on and annoying though. It didn't add anything to the experience and I thought of all the horrible performances I was missing because of it.There are some good performances on here as well by AI superstars which can be enjoyable as well. Overall I'm happy I purchased it.
2,So-So,"I'm not really that pleased with the size of these undies. While they do give me much needed support, I'm only five feet tall and the back of the panties ride/curl down while the front goes all they way up to my breasts. Not very comfy unless you stand and don't move. Would not buy again, especially at this price!"
5,Ladybug Necklace,I bought this necklace for my great granddaughter. It was a great choice. I have one also. She is my ladybug so was happy to find this on line.
4,Nice twist in time show.,"Nice, well done and worth a watch, just wish more of it out there. I totaly unique set of fights and battles in vehicles."
4,Brilliant - totally frelling brilliant,"I'm British and I get the region 2 DVDs, but I CAN say that these episodes, while not being the best of the seasons, are a welcome return to the season one stories. Although many think that season four is the weakest, while I agree to a degree, Farscape still remains as the best written, best acted SF show on telly.And to that guy who thinks that A Prefect Murder is edited wrongly by ADV, maybe he should watch the episode again. The first four scenes are repeated over and over for the first ten minutes of the show from the different character's perspectives. It's an artistic thing, a different way to tell a story, it's EXPERIMENTAL, and it's one of the reasons why I love the damn show."
5,Really Different... Awesome,"I first listened to Anouk because of my dad... he's big on new stuff, always looking for a different place to go, something interesting to see, so as I was searching for a cd to listen to, I came upon Anouk, and dad told me to listen to it, that it was hard rock and I would like it. So I popped it in and, ugh, I HATED it! Immediatly I threw it back and started listening to the radio. Well, just a little bit ago I decided to listen a few other of her songs, just incase I got a bad first impression, and, well, its not hard rock, but some of it is awesome alternative songs that everyone will love and ok slower songs. But it certainly kicks a$$, they get you in a great mood. One thing for sure though, she is NOT your normal Britney Spears or Mariah Carey. Thank God. Her music kinda reminds me of Garbage and I think everyone should get this cd, atleast try it, It's awesome. I have no clue how that guy from England who gave it 1 star got that impression."
4,"This cd has got a few great songs, but that's just a few...","Even though not all of the songs are that great, I think it's easily compensated by songs like ""Nobody's Wife"", ""Mood Indigo"" and the lovely ""Sacrifice"". This cd has got three faces: some really great rock songs, some nice and sensitive songs and a finally a few songs that shouldn't have been on this cd. But as said: these last are easily compensated. So I would say: buy it!"
3,"Awesome Voice, Average Music, Poor Lyrics","The woman can sing, i mean really sing its awesome how she can handle her voice from sweetnes to rough levels from low to high wow!!!! again, she really can sing, the music? yeah shes stuck into early and mid 80s wich is good at moments but after a while you get tired of that, the lyrics? well i have to say something to all that kind of women who think men will cry because they have decided they will not be available for a relationship or marriage ever (Greta Garbos sindrome, ""I want to be alone"")and men will beg and will keep interested on them.Girls, we dont care!!!! do you want to be alone? be alone!!!good luck with that, this is regarding ""Nobodys wife"" the rest of the songs with the exception of ""sacrifice"" and ""fluid conduction"" (wich are really overwhelming) are average pop songs.im not dying to listen other Anouk cd howeverHM"
2,Together Alone ~ Anouk,"Together Alone~ Anouk is not a very inspiring album at all and ones has the feeling that one has heard this millions of times before. Especially if one grew up in the 80's like I did. It sounds like boring 80's rock with trite lyrics, that talk about like nothing in particular. Nobody's wife sounds like she is writing for a feminist newspaper and is filled with cliches and typical lines found in leftist propaganda. The book-let is alright but she dresses like she bought her clothes at Target and they look baggy and is she lived on the streets or was part of some feminist movement. Very disapointed indeed."
4,Very Good,"Though the ""The Loudness"", the band Akira Takasaki was formaly in, was a bit of a joke, it was realy the horrible vocals and lyrics that made it that way. Takasaki delives some extremely heavy riffs that match the show perfectly. Abandoning the poor excuse for metal he once played, Akira produces a sort of mechanical grinding with some odd effects ranging from distortion to wah peddles. The album is very well put togather with some blues sounding and piano songs thrown to avert from the constant pounding. there are only two flows: the absence of an enlongated theme song and the Attrocious vocals in Broken Mirror."
4,Nicely Done,"This is traditional Christmas music, beautifully played. It is very nice for background music for decorating the tree, having dinner, or whatever."
3,"Title is Misleading - Missing ""and SQL Server""","Yes, this book is about using ASP with Dreamweaver MX 2004 - in COMBINATION with MS SQL. I'm at home doing some personal programming and can't afford the SQL server software, so what good does this book to to me? A very small amount of the book is about ASP and access, which is the most commononly used database solution for small time web developers. Maybe a book entitled ""ASP Web Development with DW MX 2004 for the Enterprise"" would be a great idea."
3,Kaleidoscope,Taken from the three albums Kaleidoscope recorded in 1967-68. Later to be semi-famous members included Chris Darrow and David Lindley (you know who they are!). The early roots of 70s L.A. rock are in evidence here.
4,A True Delight,"I grew up with the Voice of Firestone, and this DVD brings back that glorious era when TV included fine music and drama, as well as quiz shows and the Friday night fights. Of course, the technical quality isn't what we expect now, so I give it just 4 stars. But make no mistake: these women can still mesmerize. This DVD is a steal, and would be even if the only offering were Price's ""O Patria Mia."""
5,The Genuine Article,"To the point, NANA provides such a riveting story and character development that supersedes all predecessors in the genre. The characters all possess a unique personality that can be easily differentiated from one another despite the abundant cast count. The relationships that form/break and how these situations unfold provide the story with depth and has influence on the overall mentality of the character affected directly such such events. The writers did a wonderful job coinciding all the affiliates within the anime to mesh and have significant influences upon eachother. NANA is a fresh of breathe air w/o the unnecessary over dramatization (like chobits) and keeps the viewer engaged till the end."
3,"Good start, but get cheaper edition on Amazon","I got this out of the library and loved using it. My friend who speaks Swahili and I enjoy our little verbal exchanges. But please note. This is NOT a normal 16 CD Pimsleur set. This is a smaller one, only 5 CDs and 10 lessons. This price is outrageous. This same 5 CD set is repackaged for less than a third of the price and is available here at Amazon:http://www.amazon.com/Swahili-Compact-Understand-Pimsleur-Language/dp/0743550617/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&s;=books&qid;=1275705948&sr;=8-7Asante"
2,Not worth the price,"The best thing about this package is the fact you get to hear what Swahili sounds like. You will learn to say a few things. But this will not even come close to teaching a person simple conversational Swahili. Many simple words like ""boy,"" ""girl,"" ""man,"" ""woman,"" ""dog"" or ""cat"" are not even mentioned. You can learn a lot more somewhere else for a third of the price. It doesn't even teach ""My name is...""If you just want to hear the sound of Swahili, you can hear it on BBC's Swahili news site."
4,A wonderfully textured ambiant delight,"These two releases are wonderfully textured ambiant delights. Michael Brook developed the infinite guitar, which The Edge played beautifully on U2's ""With or Without You."" His technique features long, sustained notes, with layerings and ambiant echo. Bill Frisell comes to mind as a similar musician. You will love playing these discs as background, relaxing music. So will your date... :-)"
2,where's the inventory?,"I am interested in a expandable sanding drum set. There was some information, but not complete. I gave me the diameters, but not how many sanding drums for each size. How about for additional purchasing: replacement drums in all diameters and lengths as the kit has??"
4,Good set...,"I use this set of drums with a Milwaukee angle drill, to clean up the inside of bandsaw boxes and to establish contours and round over edges. For the price they are tough to beat. Have been using them for at least three years maybe a bit longer and have no complaints. I found I can use the tubes from my Jet spindle sander, just cut em in half, saves having to buy differant sets of tubes. Get two usable tubes from one Jet tube.I use this set almost every day and as I said have no complaints. This is a good buy and I recommend it."
3,These are a decent value...,"Actually I give this set 3.5 stars. I have used the larger diameter drums in my Delta 17-900 drill press with great success. I have also chucked the two smallest diameter drums into my hand drill and used them to aid in fitting new door lock/sets to old doors (enlarging the bore for the latch).For all you fellow tool junkies out there, granted this isn't the nicest sanding drum attachment set on the market, but for the home hobbyist or a pro who only occasionally has the need, these will serve quite nicely. For 20 bucks you cannot go wrong here..."
