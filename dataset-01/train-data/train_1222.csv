5,Enchanting reading,"Inkheart is a great first book in the Inkheart series, the plot of magically reading characters out of books is a wonderfully inventive idea for a fantasy novel and the author writes it in a way that enchants you as a reader. Along with suspense and magic, the story also gives a passionate accolade to the written word. Bringing books to life before your very eyes.I highly recommend with for young adults and fans of fantasy."
5,"Readers, beware!","How often do you delight in hearing a novel read aloud by someone whose heart and soul goes into the reading? As a teacher, I give that gift to my students and I was intrigued by the premise that if you read each word with just the right emphasis...........Well, if you've read the book, you know that what happens next could be highly dangerous. Great new spin on a fantasy of ""what if"". I highly recommend this book for all kids who enjoy stepping out of the ordinary and spending time in a different dimension. Super book: Inkheart."
3,Not exactly what I had expected,"The book is well written, and Cornelia Funke is a creative author. Nevertheless, I saw the movie before I read the book, and it is a rare occasion when I prefer the movie to the book. Maybe it is due to the fact that I had expected to find the same dream-like quality in the book that I had found in the movie. The movie filled me with images of beauty, even though there are dark moments in it, but the book is too dark for my liking. Also, it felt less imaginative in contrast. I expected more, and I found less. Besides, I really don't like Meggie in the book. She is a kind of spoiled girl who behaves stupidly most of the time. I couldn't connect with her."
5,This book was rockin' AWESOME!,"Inkspell, the second book in a series that Cornelia Funke hasn't finished is a great book in which Meggie and her friends set out on a journey. Dustfinger has gone back to the woven world of Inkheart. Meggie and Fraid read themselves into the book and go after Dustfinger to give him a warning. Basta has traveled into Inkheart as well and is as evil as ever.Elinor and Darius are trapped in Elinors house and pray every day that Meggie is okay. Meanwhile Mo is getting shot and Resa has found her voice. Dustfinger is once again at home and has no idea of the danger following him. can the reign of an evil king, the Adderhead, ruin Dustfingers happiness?I loved this book and I think that anyone who has read the first book in Cornelia Funke's series will like this book. Anyone who likes adventure, mystery, and romance would find this book great. Inkspell is a very well written story and I loved it.-Olivia Cecil"
5,Great Read,"Captivating story. If you ever wanted to crawl into a story or have day dreamed about a story coming a life, this is it. My son and I enjoyed every bit of it and he has read this book several times over."
4,nice work great read,this is a beautiful book. i foud the plot exciting and unique ( i have not read the book the others claim it copys) but you must remember books were not made so we could go over them with magnafying glasses and rail on the auther. the names could be better but you get to know and love the chacters great for all ages puts new depth into how you look at books and the worlds they tell of.
5,An Excellent Book!!!,"I loved this book! I can not believe anyone would give it less than 5 stars. The author pulls you into the story from the very first page and keeps your interest until the very last page. This is an original story at a time when original stories are hard to find, very well done!"
3,Funke's Flare,"In Inkheart, Meggie is a girl that LOVES books. Her father was a bookbinder and he gave her books to read, but for some reason he just won't read aloud to her. When Meggie finds out exactly WHY her father won't read to her, he gets captured and she goes on a quest to find her father AND her mother, because before she can remember, her mother left and didn't come back. Meggie's aunt, Aunt Elinor, gets involved too, and the plot thickens. Capricorn, the villain of the book, get's defeated with his own magic at the end of the book.If you are person who likes to snuggle up with a good book on a cold, or rainy, or just plain old lazy evening, then this is the book for you.If you like sarcastic humor, then pick up this book.This is truly an addicting book."
4,The Book-Lovers Book,"This is the story of Meggie, a girl who has been brought up on books,and loves them more than anything, except her father, whom she calls Mo.She, like everyone, has often wondered what it would be like to live in a book world, but when a book world comes to her life, it isn't as nice as you might think.Mo is called Silvertongue, because when he reads aloud, things come out of books.Sometimes the things are alive, and not very pleasant.Capricorn, a villain from the book Inkheart came to life in our world when Meggie was just a baby, and Mo has been running from him ever since. He couldn't run forever, and when Capricorn catches him, only Meggie---who might also have the silvertongue curse---can save him, with the cooperation of the slightly bonkers author of Inkheart,Fenoglio.Things end all right, but many bad things happen that can never be healed. That's what gives this book its beautiful realism."
2,"Boring, boring, boring","I am so, so sorry. I fear I'm going to upset a good load of people when I say that this is one of the worst books I've read in a long time. The plot was unrealistic and weak, the characters mere shadows of what they could have been in more capable hands. 500-some pages of sludge. The idea behind the story is a good one (the ability to call characters out of books). I find, however, that the book was very childish and extremely boring. Two stars at most."
3,Inkheart,"This was an okay book. It should have been a little shorter, because I wanted to get through it and be done but it was SO long. Other than that, the plot was interesting and very original, I think. But I am not going to read the sequel, because to me this book ends very cleanly and I don't know if it should be opened up again. I just want to use my imagination on what happens next."
5,By Far My Favorite Book,This is by far my favorite book of all times. Cornelia Funke is an amazing writer who I think is often times unfairly forgotten. I fell in love with all the entire cast. They really do jump out of the book and stay in your head. Dustfinger is my favorite. He is selfish but you would be to if you ripped from one world to the next. I cant wait until the final installment comes out.Make sure to read the book excerpts at the beginning of each book!!!
5,"Already reviewed before, but I forgot some important details","I love this book because it has adventure, suspense, and excitement. But, hey, if you don't like it, I'm not going to set Basta on you! :). Whether or not you likei it, it's my absolute favorite!"
5,Inkheart,"Meggie is the type of girl who would be very close to her family, she loved her father, Mo more than anything in the world. She learned to enjoy Elinor's warmth and natural beauty.Capricorn, I liked him in a evil way, but he seemed so evil, if he could kill a little boy or girl for the enjoyment, more likely a boy than a girl, who would probably be sent to be a mindless maid.I loved Dustfingers name, it was so percluir, but beautiful"
4,Cornelia Funke has done it again!,"Cornelia Funke is a wonderful writer.This book will make you laugh AND cry - ALL AT THE SAME TIME! (At least, if you are like me it will.)Love it, but I gotta go!"
1,Ick.,"I read until the last 10 pages. I couldn't bring myself to finish it. It was slow, soppy, and an utter bore.Not particularly well written. More than a bit dull. Interesting premise, but very poorly executed."
1,Is this a telephone book?,i thought i was reading a telephone book. i thought this book would never end. I even thought i saw my grandma's phone number in it. the characters in the book seemed very dull. also
1,Don't bother,"My husband and I enjoy reading Young Reader books out loud to each other and our kids. This book intrigued me from the beginning, what an idea! But we haven't finished it yet, and we're not sure we want to. 100 pages in and we still don't care about any of the characters. There's not enough character development. There are lots of inconsistencies, including the ""science"" of how the magic works. It is as if the author didn't work it out before putting pen to paper. I'm surprised the editor didn't catch the occurrences when this statement conflicts with a previous statement."
2,SEVERELY DISAPPOINTING!!!!,"I raved about ""The Thief Lord"" and ""Dragon Rider"" and I was overjoyed when Funke came out with this book. When I read it though, I was really, really, REALLY annoyed and disappointed. It falls utterly short of my expectations of Cornelia Funke and her other writing. The plot is meandering and I found it rather difficult to follow.Another thing that bugged me was the character names. Though this sounds stupid, I couldn't stand to read the name ""Meggie"" in print. It drove me nuts, seeing that annoying, babyish name on the page.I can only hope that the sequel will be better, though with a beginning like this one I don't really know where it can go.P.S. I really enjoyed the quotes from different books at the beginning of each chapter. That was about all I liked."
4,A very fun read!,"Whatever you think of Harry Potter, you must acknowledge that the series' success has opened the door for other kids' lit which, though superior, may not have got the attention it deserved. I can't imagine that this book would have been translated so quickly, for example.It's a really good book. A great concept - of book characters slipping out from their world into another, and being rewritten - and even if what I hoped would happen didn't, I still kept on reading.I did flag a bit towards the end, the words did merge together (an indication that the author's did, too?) but am certainly looking forward to reading the sequel, despite the general reviews being lesser.Certainly worth a read, and if I had kids it'd be a cert as a gift for them."
3,Reader,"While I did appreciate the original story line and the creative way in which the plot was put together, it did have it's disapointments. I felt that they should have went through Mo's book more, I mean I was just dying of curiousity. Also, the story did seem a bit drawn out. Really predictable too. I got really bored with the story line as I went. The only reason I finished it was because my next trip to the library was cancelled due to snow. All in all I thought the book had potential, a good story line, but not very deep as far as plots go.The climax was dead, the rising climax suferable, and the conclusion disapointing. Just thought I'd give warning."
2,"Interesting, but without real direction","Like her previous work, Thief Lord, Inkheart doesn't have a sense of rising action, each event seemingly carrying no more weight of significance than the last. Thus, the books have no feeling of direction, and it's all too easy to close them up anywhere along the way, which is what happened to me when reading Theif Lord, and is happening now with Inkheart. Perhaps it's a stylistic issue, and Ms. Funke's style may be as valid as anyone else's and simply not to my liking; however, I suggest Cornelia take a page from some of the masters, such as CS Lewis and JRR Tolkien: the action starts within a few pages of having cracked the cover and builds intermittently to a crescendo from there."
5,Dealing with the objections,"1)""lack of evil in capricorn""It is true that Capricorn (the villan) is not a loud, firey character, but it's his icy intensness and the fact that you only see a small part of him that makes him terrifying.2)""stupid decisions by characters in critical situations""if the characters are human, they will do stupid things. period.3)""LONG""To read this book, you need to be a person who likes to read. Do not read it because you need some random book to read for school or something. If you like to read (esp. fantasy) you will like this book. Yes, it is long...which means more moments of an awesome story. Yes it describes alot...which helps you to enter the world of Inkheart.All in all, this book is perfect for snow days, holidays, or any day. Read it with hot chocolate...Dare to read it aloud!"
2,The Book That Died,"It could have been a great book. It had an interesting plot line, fun characters, and a great beginning. But the author choose to kill the book and it died a painful death.The book starts off well, introducing the mysterious Dustfinger. The mystery and descriptions are well done, and you are hooked. But after the first 90 pages or so, the book loses its magic. The characters fail to develop. The great descriptions at the beginning grow heavy and bog down the book until it drowns. This is one of those books that where you cannot wait for it to end so you can go read something else. There are few redeeming features after the first hundred pages; occasionally a good morsel here or there. This is not one of Cornelia Funke's best works; if you still wish to try this author, I would suggest The Thief Lord."
3,Engaging yet something was missing,"I picked this up at the bookstore due to the cover art. I leafed through it and thought it looked like a good read, so I took it it home. The plot is great and very imaginative. You start to really care for the characters, but what kept throwing me while reading is the dialogue. Who talks like this? Maybe since the original is in German, something got lost in translation, but I keep think to myself that no one talks in the cadence as written. I also felt that the prose was a little staccato for even a children's book. Again, maybe something got lost in translation. Otherwise, I fine read and one I look forward to sharing with my daughter when she gets older."
3,Not much of an entertaining read,"I enjoyed the book and found the story unique (the first I read about people reading characters ot of books). However, the more I read the less I started to care about it. It seemed to be an never ending story about the characters escaping and then getting caught again. It was frustrating and made me like the characters a little less. Dustfinger was not likeable at all and Mo was way too innoncent and trusting for his own good. I liked Meggie by the end she went from being brat to maturing at the end. My favorite character was Eliane she seemed the one with the most sense and personality, but seemed to suffer unfortunate circumstances. Overall, I liked the book, but I don't think I can ever read it again like I do with my favorite books. I think is entertaining story for the moment, but can easily be forgotten."
2,Interesting but too long,"Inkheart is a long book and is not for readers who like short and to-the-point stories. Though the plot and ideas are very original and interesting the book never seemed to end. I usually do not mind long books, but as a friend said,""It seemed that the adventure ended and started again too many times"". I agree with this remark, and also thought the adventures stopped and started too many times. If you do not mind the kind of book I described above, go head (the following remark will not make sense untill later in the story) read the characters out of the book. ;)"
4,Inkheart- An interesting tale.,"Inkheart is a wonderful book that is hard to put down. Cornelia Funke wrote a wonderful fantasy that makes your mind wander to a new world.Meggie, the main character, has a hard life. Her mother disappeared to some unknown place, and it drives her crazy. Her father, Mo, is her hero and she loves him more than anything. Meggie also loves books. She gets this from her father. The special book they have, Inkheart, takes them on an unexpected journey that leads to trouble.I would highly recommend this interesting tale."
2,Inkheart,"I was expecting more from the book, since a movie was made out of it, then I actually did. The plot could use some more developing."
5,Awesome,Ok so in reading group we are reading The Thief Lord Which is by Cornelia Funke.Its really good so far.... I was looking in the library and I saw InkHeart! Omg the moment I started reading it I just loved it! Although its kinda inapropriate for my age (im a 5th grader) just because of the violent and launguage in the whole series! I would recommend about 11and up for this peticular book...!!!!!! I would totally rate this 5*****stars!!!!!!!!!!!-GirlyGirl27
4,It's good. Not super. Not bad. Just good.,"This is entertaining. I'm a very hard critic of most books, and I don't even bother to review most stories I read because they just aren't worth my time. I've been searching for books that are as exciting as the Harry Potter series (not happening) or as enthralling as DaVinci Code and Angels-Demons (yeah, right).But this book is just good. It's cute, it's imaginative, and it's an easy read. Older childen will enjoy this a lot more than most adults, but it's worth a look. I'm going to get the second book in the series and see how that is."
3,Could Have Been Better ...,"I enjoyed this book, but felt it could have been edited a bit tighter and the story still would have been just as good. I enjoyed the undertones of Tolkien and Lewis, and the ingenuity of the plot, but I found myself urging the author to just get on with it already. Lots of build-up near the end for a so-so climactic ending. Ultimately a good read, but I'm not sure I would continue with the series (although I absolutely adored Elinor ... She was by far one of the best characters I've read in a long time)! I will go see the movie (although it does look as though it has deviated from the book by quite a wide margin)."
3,Not that good,"I don't think that this book is very good. I read it in German though, so the English version might be better. I still have to say that her first book 'The Thief Lord' is far better and I loved to read it. The characters are just not very good and I didn't have the feeling that story needed 500 pages."
5,Wonderful Book,"Inkheart is one of my favorite books. I have read some of the reviews and I realized that while the kids liked the adults did not. There was some complaint about the length, I think that the length was perfect. I also liked that the story was full of excitment. There are other books that I liked better, but this one is on my top ten."
4,Good book but not as Good as The Thief Lord,"Good book, but read Thief Lord after this one. I expected so much from Cornelia Funke after Thief Lord. I could not put the Thief Lord down from page one. This one was a slower start. Once I got into the part I considered interesting, I didn't want to put it down, it just took me a while to get there. This is a very good book, just make sure to read this one before Thief Lord."
3,Needs action!,"I have to admit that I liked this book, but it took me a very long time to read. The story line is great, it's just that the plot doesn't stick well. A girl and her father, searching for a book. Kind of boring. The begining is enticing, the action is very spread out and short lived. Most of the time they are just wandering about, and I find this kind of pointless. As I said before, the begining is enticing, and towards the end the twists and turns get a it interesting.Good read if you are a slow reader (which I am not in the least), but if it's action you're looking for, I recommend the Hunger Games or Water For Elephants."
5,Review of Product purchased from Amazon,"I was VERY satisfied with my recent purchase from Amazon. I would recommend buying from Amazon not only because of the ease of shopping, but the items that I have purchased are always in the condition as purchased! PRICES ARE GREAT ALSO!!!"
5,You NEED to read this book!,"Cornelia Funke, has written many popular books for young adults, including, Dragon rider, The Thief Lord and more. However, none are as spellbinding as Inkheart and its sequel Inkspell. Funke has won numerous awards for Inkheart; it has been awarded A New York Times Bestseller, An ALA Notable Book, A USA Today Best Seller, A Publishers Weekly Best Children's book, and A Kirkus Reviews Editor's Choice.Inkheart tells the story of a young girl named Meggie. Meggie is shocked to find that she has a powerful voice that can send things in and out of books! What she doesn't know is that this power is dangerous. A dark past awaits her in a secret world, to be discovered on one rainy, faithful night.I recommend this book to anyone who loves books. Even for those who don't like fantasy, it spins you into a world of words and is hard to put down. It's an amazing book, meant for kids, but great for all ages!Clare Buckner"
2,Not as good as the cover,"I love fantasy - especially children's fantasy because I'd like to write it. And I was greatly disappionted in this book. I read the reviews and thought it would be a great one. But it wore me out. The characters were boring and they kept returning to scenes and places that were uninteresting... because they'd already been there. I am not one to leave a book unfinished and I kept hoping they would do something new or see something grand... this story line has SO MUCH POTENTIAL - but the author did not develop it.I'd say keep looking, if you are thinking of purchasing this book. Or at least check it out from the library first."
5,About a Book,"The author does a good job of weaving the story of the adults just as well as she does the story of the main character - twelve year old Meggie. It's not quite as often that one sees a children's fiction book with the kids hero/heroine going on an adventure with his or her parent(s). This is great for the 9-12 age range the book's aimed towards, but it can possibly entertain adult readers too. It's full of magical creatures, an evil villain and his sidekicks, and even a bit of a love story (a love triangle - sort of - a sad love for someone that doesn't belong to you, enough to make the main story interesting). But mainly it's Meggie's story, a story about stories and how they can be the most powerful things in the world. And quite literally, in Inkheart."
2,Quite the let down,"For those who enjoy clever book references, this is the book for you. For those who want a well balanced fantasy book, steer clear. The characterization is Ok at best, the plot is endlessly repetitive with the main characters being caught and escaping several times without in any way moving the plot forward, and the fantasy aspects are more just references and teases than any actual magic. The forboding malevolence of the main villain is very well described before we meet him, but soon after encountering him we find there is nothing interesting to him at all. From what I've heard, the sequel makes up for all the weaknesses in this one, so I could read it to find out.Maybe..."
3,"Good, but could've been better.","I haven't seen the movie yet, but I read the book hoping it would have an action-packed finale. There are no tornadoes or flying monkeys in the book. In fact, there's not much action at all, and for a 500-plus-page book, that's a crime."
3,Inkheart,The book was great but I believe that it was a little long and drawn out. The writer had fraternity detail and how she described the books was stupendous
2,Disappointing,"I love books about books, and I was looking forward to reading this one, especially as it was recommended by several people who generally like the same books I do. But I was very disappointed. It's either clumsily-written or clumsily-translated: I was often more aware of the writing than of the story. But the overriding flaw of the book is that it is completely humorless. Many 'dark' stories demonstrate the strength, resilience and determination that come from the absurdity and irony in desperate situations, and the courage of laughing in the face of death. The Lord of the Rings and the Harry Potter books, for instance, are very dark but full of humor. Umberto Eco wrote, ""Laughter kills fear."" It's one of humanity's greatest assets, but there is not one such moment in Inkheart."
2,"Dull, boring and pointless.","As the title of my review suggests, I found ""Inkheart"" dull, boring and pointless. So dull, boring and pointless, in fact, that I will not waste much time going into depth about just how horrid it was. Although I'm sure ""Inkheart"" lost something in its translation from German, that cannot possibly take all the blame for the uninteresting characters, extremely slow plot, and general poor quality of the book. I must admit the premise of ""Inkheart,"" where characters are read out of another book called ""Inkheart"" within the book, is clever, and could have made a wonderful novel, but Cornelia Funke simply does not go about telling her story in the right kind of way. She writes as if she doesn't care an ounce for her characters or story. In short, every aspect of ""Inkheart"" comes across as shallow and poorly thought out. If you feel you must read something by Cornelia Funke, try ""The Thief Lord,"" which, although it has its flaws as well, is a much better book."
2,"Yawn, Don't read aloud.","If you plan to read this to your kids, bring an oxygen tank. Some sentences are so long you run short of breath. In fact, this author seems to really love sentences that drift like a leaf that's been ripped from the branch of an aged tree towering over a new forest that sets beside a surging river where horses, cattle, and sheep crossed long ago as they were driven past majestic mountains under which lay vast caverns laden with much better written books like the Prisoner of Azkaban."
2,Was anyone else SEVERELY disappointed?,"I REALLY liked Cornelia Funke's previous books, especially ""Dragon Rider"" and ""Thief Lord."" These were two M-AZING books, well worth the time, so I eagerly dove into ""Inkheart""Unfortunately, I was disappointed.I felt that the story was shallow and disappointing without much seubstance. I never really felt anything towards any of the characters (except maybe Farid), and the only one I could almost relate to was the Aunt. I found Meggie irritating and shallow in her seeming perfection and innocence. Besides that, the name ""Meggie"" annoyed me.I spared the book an extra star because the idea of the quote at the beginning of each chapter was really interedting and fun - I went out and read most of them despite my dislike for the story."
4,This book is a warning to authors everywhere!,"Authors, beware of the damage you bring forth without fear of retribution. Your thoughts may manifest into reality - perhaps not literally as in Inkheart, but in the despair written into the hearts of your readers. Also remember the Book lives on even as the author fades into obscurity.Inkheart is a suspenseful read and the characters are memorable. Meggie, Mo (her dad) and her aunt Elinor are flawed heroes who love books with a dangerous passion. King Capricorn and Basta are inky entities dripping with the evil (and more so, nearsighted stupidity) of men. Dustfinger is the anti-hero leaving the reader ambivalent to the end. An exciting and twisted read for bookworms of all ages - and perfect fare for ravenous readers 4-6th grade.Special note - the quote at the beginning of each chapter not only provides a unique clue on what is coming, but provides the reader with a menu of classic children's literature to pursue at will."
4,Very Good Read - even better than Thief Lord,"Cornelia Funke and her translators serve up some very good stories. I agree with some of the 'complaints' by the more negative reviewers, but pretty much any book could always be better, and this one is well-worth your time whether you're a kid or an adult. There are some great turns of phrase here, some interesting characters and a great premise. I look forward to more from Ms. Funke."
4,A Page Turner,"Inkheart tells the tale of 12 year old Meggie, her bookbinder father, and their journey through books. Both Meggie and Mo (her father) have the magical gift of calling characters out of books. This well crafted fantasy appeals to young teens, who best like magical mystery and excitement. The main villain of the novel, Capricorn is described viciously, yet when push came to shove he was a flat and weak character. Mo and Dustfinger, another character pulled from the text, describe the wickedness of Capricorn and his men, which is very dark. But when the action is happening, the villains are easy to outsmart and defeat in the end. A captivating read for children, a bit predicatable for an adult reader."
4,Outstanding By MB from North Boulevard,"InkheartBy: Cornelia FunkeInkheart by Cornelia Funke is a really good book. I recommend it to anyone that likes to dream. I'm giving it 4 stars because it's a mystery a fairytale and a fantasy all mixed together. I would have given it 5 stars if it wasn't so long. It is about a girl who loves a book and has read it so many times that she keeps it under her pillow at night. There was someone in her yard watching her read her book. She ran to her father's room. He thought he was joking, he fallowed her anyway...You come to find out that when her father reads aloud from the book, characters come to life. If you would like to find out more check the book out of your library. There is a sequel called Inkspell if you really like this one."
4,Review for Inkheart,"After finishing this book just a few hours ago, I have many thoughts and comments on its ending, and overall, itself. Ms. Funke' s idea to enlight Mo and Meggie with the ability to read characters out of their books is absolutely delighting. It gives the reader a thought about the real book, Inkheart, itself and what would happen if characters in it would literally pop-out!The end popped questions in my mind like: Are we part of a story that is on ink and paper? How can the real inkheart (book) tell a story about the precious one full of fairies and trolls?The ending wasn't how I expected Cornelia Funke would tie up her story. Shadow just kills Capricorn and the rest of his men, happiness is restored, and everyone lives happily ever after...good for a fairy tale, but not this one. She did better with The Theif Lord, which I thought was as excellent, if not better, than Inkheart.Overall, four/five stars would be my rating for this book."
1,Inkstain,"I haven't seen the movie but the previews looked good and I always like to give the book a chance before the movies anyway. I had hoped for better, everyone seemed to rave about the book but I found it pedestrian and dull - or in English, boring and about as interesting to read as the menu at IHOP - which at least has good pictures and decent food to reward you. The only reward in Inkheart - and I kept at it to the bitter end hoping there was some whipped cream or strawberries somewhere under that stack of syrup - is that I was finished and now can only hope the movie tells the story better."
4,naruto50x,This influenced me to continue to read to find out what happen to the main character.I just began reading it and I find out that it is interesting because of the adventures.I chose this book beause I like adventure storys and I read other books written by Cornla Frunke.
4,My son blew through this in no time,"My 10 year old loves to read and once I got his attention after finishing this book, he said he wanted to read the next one."
4,Inkheart,"'Inkheart' is the first Cornelia Funke book that I've read. I thought that the concept of the story was great, the whole 'reading' characters out of books is a really good mixture of magic and the reality of actually existing books, but the plotline itself didn't play out enough to keep you hooked on it. I got through the first maybe three-quarters without a problem, but Istarted to loose interest near the end, I'm not sure why, since this is usually the point in a story when it begins to pick up speed and not fizzle out.I did finish though, and while I thought it could have been better, Inkheart was worth the money and was a good children's fantasy. I haven't bought the sequal, Inkspell, yet, but I look forward to it."
1,worst book in the world award!!!!!! 1st place,"This is the worst book i've ever read it's boring,long,stupid,thats an under statement thers lots of other good books out there so read them and don't waste your time on this. read the lemony snicket series for a great replacment for this piece of crap! it sucksps. i'd give it a zero but they did'nt have oneplease don't waste your valuable time on this junky spur of the moment book. published in 30 minutes by walmart publishing company i'm more interested in watching grass grow."
2,Not as good as the hype,"Ok, I'm giving this book 2 stars because I haven't finished it yet, and I keep hoping that it will get better towards the end. It amazes me that anyone was able to publish this, with all the similarities to other work. Read McCaffrey, Rawn, or Rowling before this."
2,Very Disappointing,"After Cornelia Funke wrote The Theif Lord, I was expecting even better for this book. And I shouldn't have. Thief Lord was one of the better books of the new millenium. But reading Inkheart, I would've been disappointed even if Cornelia Funke WASN'T my home girl. Which she's not anymore.Meg and her father have barely any, if not, no special charachteristics. They each could be anybody. Somewhat like a fan ficition story, or pretending to be a rock star you know nothing about. If I was Cornelia Funke, I'd be writing a follow-up to the Thief Lord to regain my fans. Which hopefully, she's doing."
2,Weak,Not that good. It's a weak story. And what's with the Teen Top 10 award? Did like 8 people vote for it or something?
1,this book sucksssss,"oh my goodness. This is the most stupid book i have ever read-im sorry author, im sure your a very nice person- but idk. it was sooooo and tooooooo loooonnnnggg and it was sooo stupid. i HATED MAGGIE/ MEGGIE whatever . she is SUCH A BRATTY PERSON. I REALLY WANTED HER TO BECOME HUMAN SO I COULD SLAP HER AND TELL HER TO SHUUUUTTT UUPPPPP YOU IDIOT!!!!. Dustfinger is so random and helpless, and elenor has issues also. ALL THE CHARACTERS HAVE DUMB NAMES. That drove me delirious. I read the whole thing, but it was a WASTE OF TIME!!! Unless u like BORING TOO-LONG, ANNOYING CHARATERS, AND DUMBBBB PLOTS get this book. YOU WILL WORSHIP IT. But if any of the above stuff is a waste of ur time, DONT WASTE UR PRECIOUS MONEY!!!!! sooo yeah... i hoped this helped u ppls!BTW- I would give 0 stars but it wouldnt let me!!!!!!!!!"
4,Inkheart by:Cornelia Funke,"Meggie, a girl who loves books and her father Mo, a bookbinder live comfortably in their old house until a man named Dustfinger appears one rainy night.The next day they leave the country to see Meggie's aunt Elinor, but Meggie finds out that they are actually hiding from Capricorn, a dangerous man who wants one of Mo's books. They become lost in a magical world and Meggie finds out what really happened to her mother who she believed had died many years before.I liked reading Inkheart because it is very exciting and unpredictable. Meggie and her friends had an amazing and magical adventure. After reading The Thief Lord by Funke, I liked it so much that I decided to read Inkheart. Funke is an amazing author."
4,Cool Book,"this book was great! i loved ""the thief lord"" so i got this book and for the first few days, i couldn't put it down. i love to read so it takes me only about a maximum of 1 week to finish i book, but the only complaint i have is that this book is too long! it took me like 2 months to finish it and all that time i was pushing myself to do it. other than that, it was great!"
4,A book lover's book,"I loved the premise of this story: the power of reading and reading aloud. What if characters from books could come out of their story and into this world? Living in a family of book lovers, I understand the lure of owning so many books and the ability to get lost in a story. The quotations that begin each chapter are wonderful and set the tone for the next part of the story. All in all a very enjoyable read."
3,Well Written But Lacking.,"The idea of characters from a book coming to life at the whim (or accident) of the reader was intriguing. But the modern day setting seemed odd to me. And I expected these storybook characters to be less familiar with their new world. Only Dustfinger seemed to have this trait. Also, I felt the story was about 100 pages too long. Some of the captures and escapes didn't seem to propel the story, only prolong it. Obviously Funke is a gifted writer. My only complain is the over usage of the phrase ""only had eyes for..."" near the end of the book. Inkheart is a wonderful idea for a book but a bit lacking in execution."
5,A classic in children's literature,"I loved Inkheart more than any other children's novel I've read. The story is about Meggie, a twelve-year-old girl who has a great love for books, who gets into an adventure she'd never thought could happen in reality.Meggie's father, Mortimer, is referred to as ""Silvertongue"" for his strange ability to read out fiction characters from books. One night, he makes a grave mistake by reading aloud the ruthless and wicked Capricorn, the villain of a book called Inkheart. Many years later, Capricorn comes back for Mo, wanting his copy of the book under his possession. Meggie and Mo then tries to desperately escape from Capricorn and his men, but there seems to be no way out. They have to face him and think of a way to defeat him before he claims even their lives.A fantasy thriller with colorful characters and a very unique and interesting plot, Inkheart is a fun read I assure that you'll enjoy until the very last page."
3,For once the movie was better than the book,"I watched Inkheart the movie and that got me wanting to read the book. Everyone always says, ""The book is better than the movie"". But, not with this first book in the Inkheart series. It was drug out, I kept thinking, ""just get on with it!"" I think it has great characters and the plot is well-constructed, but it's just too drug out. My husband is on the second book and he says it's much better so far. Meggie is going to be doing some writing herself and it has some of the actual Inkworld in it's plot. I would recommend this book because it is a fun book, but just beware you'll want to get to the end sooner rather than later to start book 2.(BTW, for those who have seen the movie and want to read the book like I did, the book is nothing like the movie!! Same concepts and characters, but way different!)"
5,Amazing!,This is one of my favorite series of all time! I highly recommend that everyone read it! I also love all of C. Funke's other books! What a talented author!
3,It's okay,"I'd heard so much about this trilogy over the years, from people who usually share my taste in books. I decided to finally check it out and I have to say it was a disappointment.It's an OK book, but it does not live up to the hype at all.If you don't set your expectations too high, then I'm sure it will be a fairly enjoyable book. But in my opinion it is no way near the masterpiece some have made it out to be."
1,Dont trust the seller!!!,What you seen in the picture is not what you get. You do not get the 3 pieces but just the slot end. I would not trust to buy from this seller again.
5,Who won't know Heinichen now ???,"Remember the fabulous album of Reinhard Goebel ten years ago ? (Archiv, Diapason d'or). He puts a name on someone who was unkown from the grand public. Heinichen has written some masterpiece which sound like the Great J.S. Bach concertos. The Ouvertures sound like Telemann. A lot of suprise, a lot of joy. Here, ""Il fondamento"" plays with fresness and a lot of enthusiasm. Frantic allegros. And we have the chance to hear some concertos and ouvertures that Goeble never played (one exception : Sieble 214). Just listen to the beautiful Concerto pour hautbois d'amour or the litte ""vivaldian"" concerto for violon . This CD is a must. The sound is not exceptional as it was the case in the Archiv Cd but it does not matter. The music is sublime !!! And the musicians are very talented. Great Buy !!!"
5,This grown up feels like a kid again!,"Okay, I'll admit it. I bought these CDs because some of my fellow Victor Garber fans were going on about them. But hey, guess what? I've really enjoyed the stories, too! James and Deborah Howe really thought things through with the first book, and I loved the wonderful silliness of 'bloodless' white vegetables in the kitchen, Bunnicula's 'cloak', 'fangs' and daytime sleepiness, Chester trying to be Van Helsing and failing in hilarious fashion. Poor Harold.... I'd be glad to feed him chocolate cupcakes and give him MTRs anytime!James has expanded the world of Bunnicula very well in the second and third books. After vampires, what else would you expect but werewolves at Chateau Bow Wow? The fiasco at Toby and Pete's school play had me giggling like nobody's business! He knows how to let the inherent ridiculousness of the situation build up to a great comic crescendo. I promise you I will get hold of the next three books, as I can't wait to see what happens next!"
4,It's just audio.,"I somehow missed that this is just the audio for the books. There are no books included. I received a 6 CD set. What we did get is lovely, high quality story telling. I thought that there would be books to follow along with...oops."
5,Buy this now.,"Victor Garber's narration is fantastic. My daughter already read some of the books in this series, but found the audiobook totally captivating anyway. I loved it too."
5,"What Voice, Bravo!",The unabridged CD-Rom read by Victor Garber is quite notable. The reader gives voice to all the characters. He creates a suspenseful climax through variations in his voice. The reader also attributes to the modern fantasy by reading the greatly written science fiction work with belief.
4,good video,this video is helpful and keeps the kids attentive to what is happening I would recommend it
3,aka The Man Who Loved The Normandie,"Here is an intriguing story based on the destruction of the world's most beautiful ocean liner in her time, the French Line's Normandie and an American man who wanted to copy her for his own country's project for an ocean greyhound.Justin uses the well worn theory of sabotage in his story and Normandie destruction being part of a plan for even more carnage.Set against a race for time, Justin uses the then secret underworld of the spying network that both sides used during the second world war.Famous people from the salvage operation are interwoven into this novel.A high impact conclusion rounds out the storyline.Although the plot does drag on a bit (it could have easily shedded a hundred pages) I found it an enjoyable story the based itself on an actual event that still has some unanswered questions to answer for it."
4,This book was pretty good,"I guess it was ok. Kinda unremarkable, but still ok. The characters were ok, the plot was ok, everything was ok, ok?"
3,Duped by the cover,"'Closing a Deal', 'Asking for a Raise', 'Buying A Car' on the cover sucked me in to buying this book. However, I didn't find much correlation between hostage negotiation and the business world other than some obvious points (i.e. do your research). The book had some funny stories but more from an entertainment perspective than a learning tool.I think Mr. Misino did a poor job in correlating hostage negotiations to the business world."
4,"The love , the patriotism and the duty !","Clark Gable , Lana Turner and Victor Mature compose this absorbing film .It deals with the fiercy Dutch resistance movement against the German occupation .Lana Turner will appear to Gable as the real traitor . Somehow the plot will reveal unexpected realities .A honest film ."
4,War movie about the Dutch underground,"Studio: Metro-Goldwyn-MayerVideo Release Date: December 11, 1991Cast:Clark GableLana TurnerVictor MatureothersGable is Dutch intelligence working under the Brits, training Lana Turner to work in Holland with the underground. She has a questionable background, but he trusts her.

Nothing special about it, except the cast. They all do their jobs well.Joseph (Joe) Pierreauthor of Handguns and Freedom...their care and maintenanceand other books"
1,Extremely bad transfer and horrible disc quality!,"This CD release of ""Betrayed"" suffers from image quality notunlike the worst videotape you ever owned. It was hard to getinto watching this film because of how poor it looked on-screen!From now on, I'll think twice about ordering any of these WBarchive titles. It would appear that no attention was paid tocleaning up these films before offering them to the public."
4,Good...,"Like most of the others who reviewed these jewel cases, I found 2 broken ones. The first was the top one, which was totally cracked. And the second was in the middle. Even bending the cracked ones they seemed pretty sturdy. One reason may because they had both my jewel cases and a 100 pack of CDR spindle in the same box..."
1,Broken,These arrived broken and cracked. Only about 5 were usable. Even the usable ones are flimsy and keep coming apart. Terrible product.
2,OK - if they survive the shipment,"The majority of my cases were damaged in shipping. I immediately threw away about eight, but as I tried to use the rest I gradually found ten or so more that had sustained damage as well. Maybe I'm alone, given the other high ratings, but these seem more fragile than other slim cases I've used in the past. I'd give them 3-stars (because they're cheap) if they didn't have to be shipped."
4,No complaints,"Items were as advertised, arrived ahead of schedule and undamaged.In short, the sort of product and service one should expect from any retailer."
2,Very bad,The ones that came with my order were damaged very badly. When I opened the package little plastic shards were all over the place. Buy this if you like to have broken jewel cases.
3,Good but not great,"Nice and convenient. However, I've ordered a couple of these and there were 2 or 3 in each package that were cracked and unusable."
3,Great Quality & Price,"I use these for photo CD's for better protection than just a sleeve. Draw back is that they have no lable or card for info, otherwise nice light weight - great price."
1,Arrived in Pieces,They would be very wonderful jewel cases except they must be very flimsy because more than half of them arrived broken.
1,DON'T BUY,"DON'T buy! One arrived cracked; numerous others had pieces broken off at hinge. Am sending back. Cheap, brittle plastic."
2,1st case was cracked,the only problem i had with this purchase was when it arrived the first case on the top was cracked...
2,"product fine, but not a mail order item","These Memorex jewel cases are fine and good for the price; however, in answer to my fears, they are not a type of item which I will again order through mail order. When I opened the pack, I found two cases badly damaged. Being that there are 25, it wasn't worth my time and effort to send the whole package back...This is an item best purchased in a store where you can examine before buying. I wouldn't purchase eggs online either"
4,THE PHYSICS OF DEITY,"It is no longer sufficient for scientists to simply deny the reality of deity outright without first considering the evidence. If mankind is to have any hope for a future, scientists must examine the God question rigorously and scientifically. In their book Conscious Acts of Creation (Pavior, 2001) William Tiller and Associates have in my opinion taken the first step in that direction.This book is essentially a spiritual interpretation of quantum mechanics, and I believe it is the first attempt by mainstream science to explore the question of deity scientifically. Unfortunately, a great deal of the research described in the book is far too technical for the average reader, but the narrative summaries of their findings are astounding and easy to follow.The Authors tackle the God question as a legitimate area of scientific inquiry and deal with it as they would any other physics problem. We can only hope that Tiller and Associates will not be the last to do so."
4,a mind blowing read,"This book is a scientific exploration of the interactions between spirit, mind, and physical matter. It presents extensive technical explanations of theory, data, and experiments having to do w/ the manipulation of physical matter by human intentions.The author arrives at understandings that bridge quantum physics and eastern mysticism in an attempt to outline a new scientific paradigm that pays heed to origin of matter in awareness instead of vice versa.My favorite is the detailed explanations of how a 9 dimensional reality works, and how we are in a sense spirit operators in the lower dimensional reality who interface that reality through the brain and body machines in search of spiritual experience and transcendental knowledge.It is a mind blowing read, to send chills up the spine of anyone who is into this stuff, but it also a mind shattering read in that it is so thickly worded and technical that it is hard to understand. (Hence the 4 stars instead of 5) But anyway, loved it"
3,Intuitive Beginner Immersion,"The Pimsleur system pretty much uses the same language lesson and teaching technique and translates it into as many foreign languages as they could hire speakers willing to make the recordings. The Farsi course is a slimmed down ""beginner"" version of this language learning course. It is excellent for training you in pronouncing the words correctly and in mastering a limited vocabulary of ""essential conversation"" terms. However, all conversations use the formal ""you"" form. Pretty much, it's set to give you enough skills for a quick business trip. If you want a more extensive understanding of the language, supplement the Pimsler course with a book and or another tape/cd course."
1,not worth the money!,"I hate to say it but this tape set was a gigantic waste of money, granted you do learn some farsi words and sentences and the pronounciation is clear and good and yes you will learn alittle BUT my biggest issue with this set is that it seems like every single tape repeats the same thing on the first tape with what seemed like no new material being taught at all, so essentially for all that money you will learn how to introduce yourself really well and make polite small talk but above and beyond that forget anything relating to life/weather/work/school/family/life or Iran.forget it!"
4,Decent product,"I bought it for my dad for Christmas, the product itself is good. I was expecting a little more than vibration, but I guess it still helps with tense muscles. Beware this buyer though, I won't go into what was so HORRIBLE about the packaging here; because I already gave them 2 of 5 stars in the seller feedback."
4,A must-read for anyone considering older child adoption,"I devoured this book in 2 days - we are considering older child adoption, and this was a good introduction. It is a bit outdated, which is rather distracting at times, but it mentions a great variety of behavioral problems and some solutions. Written as four gripping stories, the technical information is easy to understand."
1,Incredibly Outdated Resource,"Seriously - this book was written in 1978 & while I'm sure that it was a progressive resource at the time, it is unbelievably outdated. The book assumes that the only people looking to adopt a child are heterosexual, married couples (true enough 30 years ago) & devotes a lot of time to discussing how to manage adoption expectations and issues with your spouse. I can't say that it doesn't still have useful insights, but as a single woman looking to adopt, I found it extremely frustrating. For an up-to-date incredibly useful resource, I recommend Attaching in Adoption by Deborah Gray."
5,Surprisingly Current Almost 30 Years Later,"As we move forward in the adoption process of a 17 yr. old, I am thrilled to have just read this book. It was an easy read, full of insight, with just the right balance of warmth and challenge. Best of all, as both a professional counselor and adoptive mother (seven times over!) the author is truly credible, including a nice mix of research and personal experience. I give this book my highest recommendation."
4,Great Companion,"I'm about half way through the adoption process and am currently about half way through this book. Although it is over 20 years old, the information is GREAT. It has aided me in some more questions to ask my social worker that I would not have thought about before - and should have. I HIGHLY recommend this book for any one considering adoption of a child older than five. It's right on the money as far as the process you need to go through, and questions you should ask."
2,"Qualitative, not quantitative","This topic is extremely important, and deserves many books to be written about it. Unfortunately, there are very few books, and this is one of the best. It's a nice narrative, but it is essentially a collection of four fictionalized case studies. I found it very hard to learn anything from these that would be relevant to making decisions about caring for the many youth who need lifelong homes."
4,Info is easy to follow,The writing style that the author chose lays out the information in a story that makes it easy to follow. I have read a lot of adoption books and most are written in lecture style. Has been a great read and learned something too!
5,Description in Detail: The Revolution in the Church,"This is an outstanding account of the events that revolutionized Catholicism. The fruits of the revolution abound around us. Millions of Catholics lost their religion, and the larger society has changed irreversilby since the Council of the mid 1960's. How did this happen? Why did the traditions of nearly 2000 years get jettisoned in an apparently mindless quest for ""relevance"". This book details what may be the most significant event of the twentieth century. It is certainly the most underappreciated event. It is written from an unabashedly traditionalist viewpoint and describes the revolution within the Church and how it was executed.Pope John's Council is the second book in Davies' trilogy and is the most accessible of the three. Anyone curious about what has happened to either Roman Catholicism or Western Civilization over the past 30 years needs to read this book."
3,satisfactory experience,"Fast delivery. Book in very good condition, musty or smoking smell very strong. Whichever it is, air out products a few days before mailing, longer wait, but less disatisfaction."
3,VERY DISAPPOINTING SOUND QUALITY,"I do not own this box set but I have listened to it,it is a huge work and contains so much of Dusty's output including rare tracks and is very well presented,MY COMPLAINTS CONCERN ONLY THE SOUND QUALITY,ACTUALLY A LACK OF IT.I always try and find the best possible recordings/transfers,by this I mean the tracks must be stereo where possible and properly remastered,this is sadly often not the case with older pop music AND IS THE CASE HERE,AS ALL THE EARLY TRACKS AND SOME LATER ONES ARE MONO AND HAVE A VERY MUDDY SOUND QUALITY.NOT GOOD ENOUGH IS WHAT I SAY,BUT DO HAVE A LISTEN AND MAKE UP YOUR OWN MIND.I realise most reviewers have raved about this box set,but they are reviewing only the music,which is beyond the 5 stars,my rating is 1 star for sound,5 stars (the max allowed) for Dusty's music,average 3 stars."
3,Not What It Seems,"This is not a book about Dusty Springfield. It is a songbook for guitar and other instruments. This should be clarified in the description for people who are debating the purchase. It comes with a CD of the songs which are included in the songbook. This was a very misleading description for me, and hopefully, others will not follow."
2,This book contains a historical mistake,"For those of us living along the Lewis and Clark trail in Montana and using this book with school children who study Lewis and Clark, we found an obvious error of historical fact. Lewis and Clark never traveled into the Flathead Valley as Kroll states on page 23. Instead, the explorers crossed over Lost Trail Pass into our lovely Bitterroot Valley and traveled north to make camp at Traveler's Rest, on the edge of present day Lolo, MT. The old Lolo trail (now US highway 12) leaves the Bitterroot Valley crossing the Bitterroot Mountains to the west. Could it be Kroll became confused because the Native Americans Lewis and Clark met in the Bitterroot were the Salish Flathead tribe?"
4,Great Product,We bought one for our house with AT&T giving us 1 or no bars except in one spot. Put the antenna there and the unit at the other end of the room with the antenna oriented at 90 degrees to the receive antenna and now we have cell phone throughout the house and basement! Works as promised and was easy to set up. I put it on our UPS so we have good signal even in blackouts (assuming the cell tower is on). Thanks.
5,Works Great - Office in a metal building,"This unit works great! Our group works in offices located inside of a metal building. Before the signal booster installation, you would have to go outside of the building to use your cell phone. Your phone may ring but then you had to make a mad dash to get outside before the connection failed. Now with the booster installed, you can catch all of your calls and remain in the office without any concern of loosing the connection."
4,YX-510 dual band repeater,"After installation, went from No Service- 0 bars inside my cabin to a consistent 3 bars with 4 bars most of the time and 5 bars within 5 feet of the unit. I am very pleased to say the least. Even down at our lakeside dock (~300 ft. away) I went from No Service to 1 bar. Not really enough to talk on the phone but enough to be informed of a call. Of course I installed the sending unit up high so it could send through the windows aimed toward the dock. When I climbed up on the roof looking for reception to install the antenna my iPhone showed 2 bars so that is all I was expecting to receive inside the cabin. You can imagine my elation when I got 3 to 4 bars. The Iphone was being used with 3G turned off. With 3G turned on it drops to 0 bars. I installed the external antenna on top of my TV antenna, about 15 ft. above the roofline.The YX-510 is a recommended buy."
1,Not very reliable...,"Worked until it crapped out. Replaced under warranty. Crapped out again, not under warranty- they offered to sell me a re-firb for the same $ I could get the Verizon extender by Samsung. Guess what I'm gonna do...."
3,Okay but not great,I installed the antenna in the attic and the main box on a top shelf in the den. I only get a boost in signal (more than 3 bars) if I'm within 5ft of the box. I've tried moving the antenna to several different locations but haven't found anything that gives me a anything better than 2 bars in the rest of the house. Two bars is okay but I was hoping for a lot more.
1,cell phone signal booster,This product did not increase my signal strength at all. It was a waste of time and money.
2,Timid signal booster,"The manufacturer goes through great pains to make sure the signal booster does not interfere with the normal cellular transmissions. As result, it does not really boost the signals too well.Wireless Extenders Cell Phone Signal Booster Dual Band YX510 PCS/CEL"
3,less than hoped for,Attic mount one half story up must be too much in line it doesn't help much. I THink it would be better more out of antenna plane.
2,Signal Blooper,"I was disappointed in this wireless extender. I followed the detailed instructions on antenna and base placement but no matter what I did, there was no improvement in my cell signal. Could I have a defective unit? How could I tell? All the lights work in the sequence outlined but with the unit on or off, the signal remains the same."
1,"So far, NO LUCK!!!","play YX510 for about 4 days and still no luck to figure how it is working. I have two stories with about 3 bars of outside signal strength. My first floor have 0 to 1 bar. With this device, most of time, not see 'significant' improvement. The antenna is more than 15 feet away the base and outside on the roof. When phone is within half 'feet', I see 3 bars and NO problem to make/receive call. Once away the base, it decreases, 5 feet away, same as without YX-510. No help/support info on their Web site.5-21: find support info on their web site and get support person. Thing are told 1, I WILL NOT get same signal strength as outdoor, 2. vertical distance should more than 15 feet (my is around 15 feet or more). In order to have more bars, I need get high end antenna. 3. It is normal that I have 3 bars (in my case) around the base and 0 or 1 around 5~6 feet away."
3,Works But Not As Advertised,"We decided to pick up this device as one of the guys in the office is getting a home office and has poor cell phone reception in his basement. Seeing the 2500 sq feet range, we thought that this would be a great item to get to help with his cell phone.Setup went fine, getting a signal to his phone did not. Installation was just connecting co-ax cable to the base unit and the antenna. We made sure the base was the proper distance away from the antenna and tried the phone. No signal. Tried moving the box and still no signal. Moved the box to within feet of the phone and finally picked up a signal.I can say that this does get you a signal, but the 2500 sq feet should read more like 2.5 sq feet, if that."
1,510 replaced by cheaper 545,Not sure why this product is still on Amazon from 3rd party vendors - it has been replaced by the yx-545 which is more powerful and cheaper directly from amazon (189!)
5,Finally - cell service downstairs!,"We live in a suburban, 2-story home. Any time a cell phone rang while we were downstairs, we had to run upstairs so that the call would not be lost when we answered it.When we received this cell phone signal booster, my son attached the receiver to the outside of the house near the roof where the signal is strongest. We then ran the cable down the wall into the inside of the first floor family room where we placed the booster.What a difference! In the same spot where only minutes before we had 0-1 bars on our cell phones, we suddenly had 4-5 bars. We installed it over a month ago and have had strong, continuous signals downstairs ever since.I'm a believer!"
5,ZBOOST dual Band,"I have an office in a metal building with tinted windows. I was unable to use our cell phones without walking outside. I bought the ZBOOST and am now able to talk inside anywhere in the office. From reading the other reviews, I thought that it would be a problem ounting the antenna, but we just drilled a hole and mounted it to the side of the building. We have four cell phones that we use, we went from 1 bar to 5 bars immediately!We even have the base unit in another room from the main office. Very satisfied with this product!"
1,No help,"Have a 1,200 s.f. basement with bad cell phone reception.This product did not help increase recption at all."
3,Short distance.,"I install it in the roof of my house following all the instructions, and it works. Before I was not able to make phone calls from my room but know I am capable. Sometimes I have to dial one or two times so that it detects my cell and I have signal, because of this and that the range of the signal is not very good I give it only 3 stars."
3,Worth it!,"The Zboost product works quite well. Before purchase, I was dropping all calls incoming and outgoing from my house. With the booster, I have only dropped one call in the last month. Installation involved drilling into my attic and then installing the attenae high up in the attic on the rafters. It is very important that you follow the directions for placement of the attenae and receiver.It is a relatively inexpensive solution for poor reception."
4,Good Product but signal doesn't go through floors well,"I mounted the base unit for this product in my basement and I mounted the antenna outside above the roof line on my TV antenna tower. Reception in the basement is now the best place in the house. I mounted the unit on a wall close to the ceiling in hope of getting the signal upstairs as well. It helps somewhat upstairs but the signal from the base unit to my cell phone is still not very good. I have dropped a couple of calls already while upstairs and the Booster was working properly during that time. Therefore, from my experience, the signal does not travel through floors or walls very well. However, when I am in the basement I have no problems and get perfect reception."
3,Look before you leap!,"Although this product is compact and seems like it would ""boost"" your cell signal, it only will boost what it receives from the location for it's intended use. You really need to have a steady and reliable signal outside your home or RV for it to do you any good. If you are in a roaming area or one which the ""ambient"" signal is weak or not steady, this is not the device for you. This would be a much better product if they offered a choice of antennas rather than the omni-directional one which is shipped with the product. I tried all possible antenna locations with no improvement with results."
4,Come on in!,I live in a log home with a metal roof. I think because of the metal roof it sheilded me from the cell site( 0 bars inside). Outside I have 2 to 3 bars on my phone. Now I have 2 to 5 bars inside my house. I can now use my cell phone inside for the first time. Thank's Ted
2,Very disappointed,"I bought this booster and set it up following all the instructions. I could barely detect a boost, if there was any, standing 3 feet from the unit, with the antenna mounted on a board sticking up from my roof.I contact customer support (who did email me back). They said the antenna has to be mounted 25 feet, vertically, away from the base station (this seems to eliminate any inside installation, and many outside intallations). They supply 35 feet of cable, so it is pretty tricky to find a way to get 25 feet of vertical rise, with little extra antenna cable. Of course, you probably need a big ladder and enjoy aerial work. I went back and saw that one reviewer mounted the antenna on the end of a piece of PVC pipe attached to the top of his TV antenna - seems like something most people are not going to try.I still couldn't get a signal after all that trouble, so I sent it back."
4,"Works, but temper your expectations","I am happy with the service I get from the wireless extender. I have used it for 2-3 weeks now and find that is does indeed provide me better wireless service than before, but I do think you have to temper expectations and not expect to go from zero to 5 bars.We have service through ATT with Blackberry, iPhone, and a Razor. We were never able to receive or make calls in our home as we bounced between 1-2 bars. When calls were placed they typically dropped after about 5 minutes of use. I tried other carriers and that didn't make much difference so I decided to give this extender a try. It consistently gives us 1-2 addition bars. So we went bouncing between 3-4 bars, which is just enough boost to make service work. I give this 4 stars as it does work and is easy to install. The one drawback I see is that while it says it puts out a radius of 2400 sqft, the quality varies, which they tell in the instructions is based on walls, placement, etc."
4,Great Improvement,"I was hopeful in my expectations for this product, it met my expectations, if you do some research on this product, as I did, you would see there is multiple ways of installing that will provide different levels of improvement on signal reception, I have installed it in the way in which to expect the least level of signal reception improvement and I am pleased to write that my cell phones have gone from no bars to three bars and has made them useful at my home."
4,Cell Phone Signal Booster Works,"The Wi-Ex zBoost extender I purchased has made it possible to have cell phone conversations without going outdoors. Antenna placement was critical, but after my son and I erected an antenna tower for the antenna the system works well. Before the booster, I missed at least half of the words and couldn't follow a conversation. With the booster I only miss an occasional word and can have long conversations easily. I live in an area where outdoor signal strength is only 2 bars on a 5 bar phone."
4,Works Great with Correct Antennae Placement,"When I first got this and hooked it up it didn't really work that well. Then I sat down and read the manual and now understand how critical antennae placement is. Followed the recommendations and now it works great. I went from almost nothing, to five bars back in my bedroom.I have noticed that it does lose signal for a few seconds randomly while I'm on a call. It doesn't drop the call completely, there's just a brief second when I can't hear anything. I think it might be the unit's signal competing with the actual signal from outside."
4,"Works as advertized, just follow the directions","I went from nearly zero coverage in the house to 4 out of 5 bars (both AT&T and Verizon, haven't tried Sprint PCS yet). Mounted the antenna in the attic and put the base on a second floor table. Coverage within 1000 sq. ft. of the base is quite good but drops off quickly after that."
4,BOOST YOUR SIGNAL,"After reading several reviews, including those on Amazon, I decided on the YX-510 signal booster. After carefully reading the instructions, I decided on a rooftop installation. The installation was easy, and I went from 0 to 1 bars in the home, with frequent dropped calls, to 5 bars in the home. Incidentally, i live in an older (1958) built home with notoriously thick lathe and plaster concrete walls. I would recommend this signal booster to anyone. It has surpassed my expectations."
3,ok but didn't make a huge difference for us,"Easy to set up. Clean and nice appearance. Seems to have made a difference, but not a huge difference. Not sure whether I installed it in an optimal location or not. (The repeater is in the attic as high as possible to try to reach the tower signal.) In retrospect given the actual results I got, I'm not sure it was worth the money. Perhaps i could have optimized the installation, such as by putting the repeater outdoors under the eaves, to get better results."
2,Only base station - No cords or antennas,The seller did not state whether it would have been just the base station or everything. Very disappointed in my $81.14 spent on this. Was lead to believe/think that I would get everything needed. Two stars for it being the base station.
3,Seemed ok but Microcell will be better for me,This served my purpose but the AT&T; 3G microcell will work better for me so I did not keep this.Ed
1,Doesn't Work!,Very dissatisfied with this product! It doesn't boost my cell receptionat all. I plan on returning it.
1,Didn't work for me,"Read carefully. I did not get good reception outside ever. However a neighbor tried it and it seemed to work. So I thought I would give it a try. I spent lots of time trying to get it going by moving it around and hours with the Verizon tech supports. Ultimately, I sent it back. Also, it seems to be weather sensitive.It may work very well for others in a less remote location."
1,Another good idea that doesn't work,"Wireless Extender Cell Phone Signal Booster Dual Band YX510 PCS/CEL. Followed instructions to antenna placement. Cell phone signal only got a small boost if placed almost on top of base unit. Enclosed broucher claims we could upgrade the booster and get a better signal for an additional $100+ After a $300 outlay for almost no improvement, I was not about to spend any more. Returned the item."
1,Difficult to assess!,"This product can only transfer a signal from the outside. There MUST be a strong signal already available. It is difficult to assess the effectiveness of the product. It cannot increase a weak signal. Also, the customer service related to this product is difficult to contact. Their lines are always busy."
1,Cell Boost? I think not,"Supposed coverage is 2500 sq ft, and even in the same office as the cell phone in need of boosting it makes little or no difference. I hope I'm in time to send it back!"
2,works but not well,"i went from having no bars inside to 5 bars inside but only when standing within 5 feet of the device. at 6 feet i had no signal. i returned the item ,for the money i expected the item to at least work through out the room."
1,No signal strength when using more than 75' of cable,"Sitting only 2 feet away from the base I still can't get a clear signal. I mounted the antenna on my roof above the roofline per the instructions. While on the roof, my cell phone shows 2 to 3 bars. I had to run 100 feet of coax cable (one 75' section and one 25' section) to get the base where I need it. The kit comes with 75' of cable and the instructions do say that the signal may decrease if you use longer cable than 75'. So if you can not place the base where you need it with 75' of cable - beware!"
3,Too little is not enough.,"The info on this product states that you need to have enough signal strength to make a call as a prerequisite for zBoost to work. And I have just a fraction of a bar -- sometimes -- and never enough to make a call. So, there was not enough signal for zBoost to work in my case.Fortunately, there is a money back guarantee and Amazon's return process was simple and easy to use. My money was promptly returned."
4,Cell signal booster works!,"Product works as advertised. Had a crappy (1 bar) connection inside my rural home. Dropped calls routinely. After installation (on my roof), I have 3-4 bars in half my 1800 sf home and 1-2 bars in other half (farthest from indoor antenna).Haven't had a dropped call since install."
3,Wireless Extender,"It effectively duplicates the signal it receives at the outside antenna. The key to determining if it will work for you is to use your cell phone signal meter to locate the strongest outside signal. That is the best signal you can expect this signal booster to produce inside your home. If all you get is a low signal outside, this product is probably not going to fix your signal strength problems."
3,Wi-Ex Booster,This booster helped a lot but it is not perfect. Installation is indeed very critical!
4,Works if you install correctly,"As per the other reviewers, I fiddled with the antennas, which makes all the difference in the world. IF you put the outside antenna way up high or even get the enhanced antennas you'll get great indoor reception. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the feedback on antenna replacement is by interpreting blinking LEDs which is about the most annoying feedback mechanism since the invention of computers, but it's cheap.Punchline, from 0-1 bars up to 4-5 bars indoors, can't complain too bad."
4,better than i feared,"I almost didn't buy the unit because of negative reviews, but at least for my situation, it has worked fine. The keys are: 1. to expect no more signal near the inside unit than you get at the outside antenna; 2. to make sure you separate the two antennas as described in the instructions; 3. to expect that boosted signal to decline fairly rapidly as you move away from the inside unit. Still, it has much improved both cell phone and 3G internet."
2,Did not work for me in my location.,"I live in a rural low lying area and have problems a lot of the time with cell service. This product did not really help me, but I thought it was worth a shot. I guess I'll just have to keep my land line or move. I do not necessarily think it is not a good product, it is simply not what I needed. If you're in doubt, give it a try. What do you have to loose except bad reception?"
1,Works but just barely,Tried different locations and it only seemed to help my verizon phone if i was within 5 feet of the receiver. I sent it back for a refund.
1,zBoost Not Useable With Kindle,"I have been extremely disappointed with the performance of the zBoost YX510. It has only very limited range within our home, and IT DOES NOT WORK WITH KINDLE. Wi-Ex technical support was disappointing as well. They said they had no knowledge of working with Kindle but suspected that the protocols with Kindle wireless were different than normal cell systems. They must be right. The Kindle will not establish a call even when placed within a few feet of the zBoost. The range for a normal cell phone is about 1-1/2 rooms. Not spectacular."
3,Product doesn't meet sellers claim,Install and set up were easy enough. I live in a one story brick house with a metal roof. Sprint cell phone antennas are less then half a mile away. We could not get a reliable connections in side with a sprint phone. It would drop out or go into roam. After installing the extender we were able to get minimum service connection in the room with the extender. Walk to another room and you lose it. At least we don't have to go out side to answer our cell phone now.
2,Did not work - had to return,Extender did not work for ATT iPhone. Coverage weak in zip code 95050. This did not solve the problem.
1,Expensive Piece of Garbage,"We live out in the sticks, however there is a cell tower within sight... our cell phones would just drop out on us at times and I purchased this piece of equipment to assist us... This is an expensive piece of garbage.... Like so many other things on the internet, it falls way short on what it promises. To troubleshoot, you must be able to follow the various sequence of blinking lights that change colors to determine what is happening... good luck with that one.... If you have a single level home. You are out of luck as this unit requires that you place the antenna at least 20 feet in the air. If you do not have an attic, you are screwed. If you home is not high enough you are screwed. No difference in the signal level and our calls still continue to drop on a regular basis... don't waste you money on this junk... try to find a more sensetive phone with better reception..."
1,Didn't work for me,"The product did not work for me. For some reason, I always got a light sequence which was not listed in the manual. Not knowing what the sequence meant, I could not find the means to correct it. I called tech support several times, explaining the sequence and asking what it meant. They only told me to be sure there was sufficient height distance between the antenna and the base unit, which I did but to no avail. I was not impressed with tech support. For the amount of money the unit cost, I expected more help. Regardless, I tried everything the manual suggested and several ideas of my own, including taking the unit to a two story house several blocks away and installing it there. In every situation, the unit gave the same odd sequence. Perhaps it was just a faulty unit but it would have been nice if tech would have been able to tell me that. I finally returned it for a refund (that was good) but still have lousy cell phone reeception (that is bad)."
1,does not work,"i spent hours positioning and repositioning, all per instructions. my impression is that it is an empty plastic box wiht blinking lights on it, as it never affected the signal as tested by two verizon phones. amazon was immediate in issueing a refund."
2,did not work well for me,"i live in an area where the closest cell tower is on the other side of a hill. the strongest signal is 1 bar when standing on my roof. indoor reception is zero. i tried this and it worked to bring the signal into the house, but needed many reboots throughout the day to maintain cell reception. the calls i did receive would lose reception and end after about 30 seconds. i tried numerous locations for the antenna and transmitting unit but nothing improved the reliability. i returned this unit and tried this one:Wilson Electronics 801247 Desktop (DT) Adjustable Gain Cell Phone Signal Booster for Home or Office - For Multiple Users. the wilson works flawlessly, but range is not great - about the same as my bluetooth devices."
1,Cellphone Booster,"It sucked - never got me beyond two bars - we have a major medical condition with my wife, and all calls from physicians were dropped with no clarity. I would never buy this product again even after having friends (I am handicapped) bring it up on the roof around the chimneys.I went to Verizon, and only because I am handicapped, they gave me on trial to be fair, their Samsung unit to go into my router which they say is designed for my Blackberry Storm II.It arrived today and when I know results, I will get back to you all.The Quantum Company, where I got the original one, have so far been really fair and good about returning it although I was surprised at the stocking fee of 20% because I legitimately opened it - then I found out they also had a judgement about what price to refund. HEY, it did not work - give me a break! I will replace it with the Verizon recommended unit. Let's see what happens.Respectfully -Charles E. Campbell"
3,"Works great with my iPhone 4, as long as I am within 10 feet of the unit","I was very excited to get this signal booster to use with my iPhone 4, as the reception inside my house is not the greatest.I found a great place on my roof that had 4-5 bars of reception and ran the cable down into my kitchen, where I had the base unit plugged in. As soon as I had everything set up and plugged in the antenna, my phone showed 5 bars! However, as soon as I moved more than 10 feet away from the unit, my bars quickly dropped.When I'm close to the unit, it works very well and boosts the signal more than enough for a reliable connection. However, I often find myself wandering outside of the 10 foot range without thinking...which sometimes causes my call quality to degrade or the call to drop altogether.For the price, I was expecting a little more. However, it still does its job and comes in handy when I am desperate for reception inside my house."
1,NOT worth a penny!!!!,"Bought this about a year ago, since our office has no window directly to the street so the signal is weak for everybody, that include people with Sprint, T-Mobile, Verizon, AT&T; and so on. Checked with zBoost and they said it's fine to all of the different company phones. Read a nice review in NY Times and decided to go for it.I tried every single way possible in the instructions, called the support, sent it back twice, but NOTHING WORKS. They just said our signal is too weak to boost. But if I can get signal leaning over the windows, won't this thing be able to increase it? Isn't that what we need this thing for??? If you can't increase or boost a weak signal then this thing is a total piece of garbage!!!I wasted $400 for a plastic stick and a bunch of useless wires. DON'T BUY THIS FOR CHRIST'S SAKE!!!!"
2,I guess it works for some...,"When it worked, I would get 5 bars for about 10 seconds. Power if off and back on it would do the same.... Tested on 2 different phones (iphone and blackberry.)Vendors technical support was nice, and suggested that I purchase the outdoor antenna. I move the complete unit outside and still had to luck.I was in luck in that AT&T; was offering their micro cell in my area for $150.00 and it works perfect. As normal, no return issues with Amazon."
2,Wireless Booster,"At times the YX-510 loses signal, could be related to a poor AT&T 3G connection. At times I can obtain three and four bars on my iphone within a 10' area. With the YX-510 turned off, it drops to one or two. I have raised the antenna 20' above the roof line, with no improvement."
3,Not great,Don't know if it's just where we are or not. Signal is in and out and only works if I am right next to the base unit. We put the antenna in the atic.
1,no improvement,I live in an AT&t; weak signal area and when I am in certain rooms in my home I have NO signal. I installe this zBoost on the outside and tried it for several days with NO improvement in cell phone reception. I did pick up better wireless signals form the other wireless in the area but that was not why I needed the signal booster.I have an AT&T; Blackberry phone and I was told this YX510 was the only booster that worked with this system. I returned the product extremely disappointed.
2,Worked for 2 days then stopped working,"I couldn't keep it working. It was initially set up in a temp arrangement (wanted to make sure it worked before drilling holes). It kinda sorta worked for about two days (cable was run max distance, had at least two walls between cable ends, cell phone went from 0-1 bar to 2-3 bars) then it just wouldn't keep a signal. It would have been worth putzing with at half the price, but for the price and reception I was getting, I returned the product."
2,"Worth a try, but don't believe","HI,After long search for something to help get us signal in the house I settled on this unit. setup was easy, and it did bring the signal in the house had 1 bar before and after had 3-4, however only if my phone or MIFI was within 6 inches on the base unit. If I moved further than that back to 1 bar. So I returned it, it seemed to have potential but I couldn't alway be with in 6 inches of the base."
2,disappointed,"Our new house's roof sheathing has an foil (heat radiant) foil lining one side (facing into the attic)- resulting in a cel signal force field. Outside our house we get 4-5 signal bars from a tower not 2-miles from here, but inside the signal would sometimes be completely blocked (""No Service"").The reviews that I read through my research, were good enough to convince me to throw a couple hundred bucks at our problem.Overall, we get a better signal inside than we did before. My issue is that lack of consistent signal boosting from this unit: anywhere from 1-4 bars now.I shouldn't complain, since I couldn't even receive calls during the majority of the ""pre-ZBoost"" era, but I still have some calls dropped (AT&T; on my iPhone 3G) with my ZBoost indicating proper installation/operation. Still, it was expensive!"
3,Signal booster,"The 2500 square feet area, is a load, you can't get but about 2 feet away to receive calls, then you may lose the call in about 6 seconds. Not worth the money that they are asking, for sure."
3,Need a good signal to start with,I think bottom line here is that you must find a strong signal at your location somewhere. Then install the antenna there. My signal is a sporadic ATT one. It fluctuates all day long. When it is a good signal then yes the Booster sends it down into my house via the transmitter. But it WILL NOT improve any signal strength.
1,TOTALLY UNRELIABLE,"I purchased this to increase my signal at my lake house.... the unit does work, but is totally unreliable. There are times when the lights go red, red flashing, I've tried all manner of things such as changing the position of the antena etc... I even called their customer service, for all intents and purposes, customer service sucks. I would NOT recommend purchasing this unit. It is not stable at all, I would have done just as good if I had taken my hundreds of dollars spent, and lite fire to them. I am and EXTREMELY disastisfied customer."
4,Exactly as expected,This will extend your wireless coverage by rebroadcasting the signal in an unreached area. The only reason I gave this product 4 stars and not five is the installation is not straight forward plug & play. It does take some finesse & finagling. A reminder that this is an extender and not a creator. It cannot extend what you do not have. I recommend this product.
5,Saved all my 4 WirelessVerizon lines.,"I put the antenna on top of the roof where I get good reception and ran the cable to my living room where I had no reception. The device works great. Transmits powerful signal where I need it the most. It works better with AT&T; than Verizon Wireless however it can still save your life & life of the battery!This item ""brings"" the signal closer to your device, so do NOT buy this if you get zero signal at where you live. One more thing...the device can only broadcast up to 10 feet away to you need to be always within 10 feet or else no signals. Also, you still get drops here and then but that's the nature of wireless providers."
4,Works better than expected,I read a review in a magazine and some other customer input but I was still skeptical because the cell service is so bad where I live. The installation process is significant but the results are noticable. The boost only works very nearby. No where as far as advertised.
2,Did not work for me.,"I did not get reliable cell phone service with this amplifier, for any arrangement of the antennas. I also tried the zBoost PCS amplifier without luck and eventually settled on a Wilson SOHO amplifier system with Yagi PCS antenna which works well.The only reason I give this two stars rather than 1 star is that my case may be more challenging than most because my home signal is weak but there is a strong roaming signal at my house. This amplifier would frequently get the error condition of oscillation caused by having the indoor and outdoor antennas too close together, even when I had them much farther apart than the minimum recommended distance."
4,Can You Hear Me NOW!,"I started with the cheap decal ""signal boosters"" you peel & stick to the inside of your cellphone. Then I got an add-on extendable antenna. Then I bit the hand grenade and shelled out the $300 for this booster. I have the antenna mounted in the highest peak of my attic, snaked the coax cord down through a corner of a closet, to the base in my office. It worked. The range is limited, about 25 feet, but I have cell service again. It's frustrating to have to build my own ""cellphone tower"" for AT&T, but thats about what it boils down to."
4,It will work,"I moved into an office that got poor cell phone signal. I first got the single band from radio shack. It was just okay, but later I got the dual band because of others in my office. Dual band is a better product. It came with a bigger antana and got better signal. If you are planning on getting one, spend a little more to get the dual band. Only reason I gave a 4 stars in place of 5 is, occationally I will still get a droped call or less bars on my phone. But overall it works."
5,Expensive but works great,We had no cell signal in the downstairs rooms which are below street level. The roof of our building has excellent reception but there was zero cell coverage four floors below. Placed the antenna on the roof and this device is now giving the below grade rooms the same reception as up on the roof. It has been great for our situation and we are now likely to get rid of the land line.
5,A signal 20 feet underground,"I was very impressed by this Cell Phone Booster. I live in an underground, concrete dome home. Getting a cell phone signal in the house was all but impossible unless I stood outside on the porch or by a front window. With this wireless booster, I know have a signal through all 5000 square feet. It isn't an overwhelmingly strong signal throughout the house, but it works. I don't need 5 bars to make a call. Just one will do. And you live in a place that doesn't get even get that, you appreciate every bit of signal you can get.I used an existing cable that ran from the interior of the house to the ""roof"". Our roof is about 10-15"" feet deep of earth. On the roof I planted a six foot tall post, zip-tied the antenna and cable to it and went back into the house. Attached the other end of the cable to the booster, turned it on, and I had a signal inside a concrete and steel structure 20 feet underground. Very cool!I highly recommend this booster."
2,Kind of works,"I was able to get the unit to work, but the area in which it increases the signal is only about the size of your living room. If that is all you need it would work great, but I was looking for it to at least cover most of my home. It did increase the living room size area by 2-3 bars, but signal in one room wasn't worth the price. I've decided to just forward my cell phone to my house phone when I am there. That gives me a perfect signal :)"
4,YX510 Dual Bank Wireless Extender - Great but....,"Great product that DOES work but, does not have nearly the rage extension as implied/promised. It may extend ""UP TO"" to 2500 SqFt in a wide open space like a warehouse but, in a ""regular"" office setup..... not quite that far.I find reception quickly decreases as the distance from base station goes beyond 15 feet, less if there isn't a DIRECT line of sight to the base station. In a ""normal"" office setting with walls, doors, etc I'd estimate the unit looses all effectiveness beyond 35 feet away. This works out to be about HALF of what is implied/promised.Still, this is fine for my purpose and took me from ZERO reception to PERFECT (5 bars) reception IN MY OFFICE. In other words, my previously useless cell phone now works GREAT as long as I am in my office. As I walk out of my office door I drop to 3 bars. A few steps down the hall and I'm back to ZERO reception."
3,Wireless Cell Phone Signal Booster,I put the antenna in the peak of the attic and the booster on a cabinet on the inside wall of the famly room near the center of the house. Signal is good in the family room and adjacent rooms where there was basically no signal before. Signal in most of the rest of the house is still weak though better than without the booster. The product advertises 1800 square foot coverage. Our house is approximately 2200 square feet and I am not sure that we are getting signal improvement over 1800 square feet. It works equally well on AT&T and Verizon phones. There is no signal improvement outside.
3,Got some gain....but,"I bought the unit last fall and was not able to install the remote antenna till this spring. I installed the antenna on the roof, attached to a exterior rated PVC piece of pipe which is mounted to a tri-pod antenna stand. The antenna, in total, is about 30 feet off the ground. Well, after having it for 3 months, I do get an extra bar or two for the cell phone, but my mobile wireless Internet gain has not been what I had hoped. I primarily bought the unit for the wireless Internet. EVDO signal is intermittent vs. 1RXT signal. Granted I live in a remote area with alot of trees and hills and my only other real option for Internet access is dial-up. It is important to at least have some signal, which I did before installation. It does work, but now I have to wait for the leaves to go so can get EVDO speed on the wireless card more consistently. I can live with that."
5,HUGE IMPROVEMENT,We have always had very poor cell reception in our home. Our cell phones were always dropping calls or we would get voice mails without ever getting a phone call. We had one or less bars consistently. This item was very easy to install. It took less than an hour and we had to drill through a couple of walls. Our cell reception improved instantly and we immediately went to four to five bars. I am very pleased with this item.
5,I am impressed...,"I got this unit for our office because cell phone reception is terrible there and I got moved to the middle of the building. When I first set it up, I had the antenna over by a window. I stretched the 50' cord over near my desk. The signal didn't improve much if any. So I purchased a 100' cable and ran the antenna out into our breezeway area, still inside the building. That made all the difference in the world. I was now able to get between 4-5 bars everywhere in our area, whereas before, I got 0-1. When we put the cable in the ceiling, (I had it on the floor for the test), we lost some reception, I assume due to the electrical in the ceiling, but it still works well. I believe a better shielded cable would help. The one I purchased was just a standard coax cable."
5,Works Great!!,"For background, I designed cell sites for 13 years (the tower & equipment that your cell phone talks to). After a recent system re-tune, I lost Verizon coverage inside my house. After a disastrous attempt at switching to AT&T;, I set about finding a way to make Verizon work. I was dubious that this would work but the YX510 is really the only affordable product out there that covers both cellular and PCS frequencies.I installed the antenna in my attic (after checking that my cell phone worked great up there). I ran the supplied cable down to the basement and plugged in the transmitter. Now I have a several bars of signal on my ground floor (right above the basement) where I used to have none."
3,Think it's decent,"I don't agree with the former review of this song; although 2Pac's ""Me and my girlfriend"" was a lot better, this is a good and decent version. I don't like Jay Z, but thanks to Beyonce's smooth and sexy sound Bonnie and Clyde comes alive again."
1,injustice to 2pac,pac hated jay's guts and this is sad seeing jigga steals his songs and making them pop cartoon silly stuff and beyonce is not a thug girl whatsoever if pac was here he'll slap jay z and take beyonce.
3,Great but unneccessary,"This battery is amazing, but that too is its downfall.I was upgrading from an old camera that used a battery in under 4 hours of use so I thought I would need a spare battery for my EX-Z850. It turns out you do NOT need a spare battery for the EX-Z850.Standard life is well into 600 photographs if not more. It currently lasts about 4 weeks for me (taking about 5 shots per day). A single battery survived well over 200 photographs at a wedding and didn't ever change the power indicator from green.So this is a truly great battery, but thoroughly unneccessary unless you are planning 6 week safaris with no method of recharging a single battery."
1,Casio NP-40 Battery Replacement,New battery did not work at all. Not worth the time or money to return so I threw it out.
1,bad sale,this ppl from amazon not even notice u that this battery doesnt work for the camera u bought as a combo and even know that is going aout of the country now im stock with this battery
1,Larger than the genuine NP- 40 -- won't fit in camera,although terminals are spaced the same as a genuine NP-40 -- this replacement battery is about twice as thick as the genuine battery and won't fit in my camera battery socket -->>a shame since shipping was very prompt and price was excellent
5,Great replacement battery,Works just as well as the original. Original battery was bulging in the middle and would not slide in and out of the camera without prying. Wouldn't hold a charge for long either. Getting this replacement battery made the camera function just like new.
5,Read directions.,Old Casio battery died because of over charging (read directions). This battery works good as new and arrived just in time for vacation.
5,excellent purchase,"The battery for my exilim came in timely manner, well packed, and in perfect conditions. I am very pleased with the purchase"
1,Battery is too big and did not hold a charge,I was so excited to locate this original Casio battery. It arrived in two days but after charging it for two days it did not have a charge. In addition the fit was so tight I almost could not remove it from my Casio Exilim Z750 camera. I will not bother to ship it back as it is not worth the shipping.
3,here today,Even though i haven't read this boook! it looks really good i have to read it when i buy it its gonna be good!!! i am really into books like this!
3,Great idea..but it broke after 1 months use,"I bought 3 of these...1 for myself and the other two for my daughter and daughter-in-law...It worked great, and I was really happy after looking for months for one I thought was what I wanted. But it just broke after about a dozen uses. Not sure if I should get another one or keep looking. Other people with reviews stated that theirs broke also."
1,Good for nothing,I jumped on this deal when it went on sale for dirt cheap. Now I know why it was dirt cheap. The first time I used this press it shattered in the pan. Huge disappointment. You get what you pay for.
2,Second time reviewed,"The second time we used this press, it broke in half. We followed your suggestions, by placing the press on top of the hamburger patties in the pan before turning on the electric burner on the stove. I should have purchased the more expensive TEMPERED GLASS PRESS and would have avoided this product. I plan to ask for a refund on this. Even following the sellers suggestions, it still cracked. This is not a safe product to use."
1,Don't Buy,The press broke in half after 6 uses....a waste of money. Buy a cast iron press for a little more money.
1,Glass in your breakfast!,"If I could give it 0 stars, I would. I bought this item as a Christmas present and it broke while we were using it for the second time. The piece cracked into three sections and we had glass throughout the pan. When I contacted the seller, they said it was past the 30 day refund period (purchased 11/29/2012 and reported as broken 12/30/12). No way would I ever buy this item or from the seller again."
2,It's only OK.,"The idea of a glass bacon press was good but the quality is mediocre. The handle keeps coming loose, they need some kind of gasket or washer that would hold the screw securely, also the glass itself seems rather breakable."
2,Waste of Resources,"Got mine 2/11, despite so many bad reviews. Just broke but I feel that I got my $3.50 out of it.I won't buy another because the best thing about it was the glass, which broke for no apparent reason.The handle is cheap plastic that traps water under it when washed, so you have to take the screw out each time. My screw was without a driver fitting, no Phillips or flat-tip slot, so I had to set it down on a paper towel or rubber jar-gripper and push down pretty hard on the handle to unscrew it.The screw seemed to be rusting, mostly on the threads but had suspicious-looking discoloration on the head. Pretty sure it wasn't stainless, but it should be. I was already thinking about a replacement screw or/and getting the local glass guys to make something. Meanwhile, using the Pig press but I'd rather have glass.Just too much overhead for a piece of junk and probably not worth the fuel to ship it."
5,Stylish,"This press looks great and works great. It is glass and presumably fragile so be careful. At $2, you cannot go wrong. You should buy one."
1,USELESS & BREAKS!,I ordered 2 - because the one I had before (not bought through Amazon) lasted about 5 years. This one has thicker glass and bigger knob - and after its first use - broke in the pan - same way with the second one. I think the manufacturer forgot to get them heat-treated or something like that. I would give this a (-minus star) if that was possible. Do NOT waste your money on this.
1,Wouldn't buy again,It broke after three or four uses. We didn't use the handle and we used it in the microwave so it might work better in a skillet but am not sure.
2,only fair.,"This press worked good for a short time, then the glass broke. I still need to find a good - durable, round press. Searching."
1,bacon press broke,The Bacon Press broke on the first use. I will never purchase a glass press again and would not recommend it's purchase.
4,"The Concierge Manual, 2nd Edition","Great book for new business start-ups! What amazes me, is how a people think they can buy a book and expect every answer to be given for such a small price. Most people, like myself, know that a book will give you the basic answers to your start up basic questions. Especially a how to book! I have purchased this book and got what I expected, a simple ""how to"" for new business starters and some direction. If I thought I could start, run and become a business giant just by buying a book, I would have done it along time ago This book gives you what you need to get started, basic direction. I have worked with author in consultative manner and have gotten more then expected. The book is good and will direct you, it is working for me."
4,A good book for a beginner,"This is exactly what I wanted ... a great beginners book. Told me everything that I needed to know to start my business. I read that other review of the book and actually don't agree with it. This is not for you if you want a ""franchise"" type book. It's a simple primer and nothing more. Ms. Giovanni never claims to have all the answers, she just gives you a great beginning. I too waited three weeks and am very happy with the book. It didn't answer all my questions, but then again I have never read a book yet that did."
3,A Great Book,"Simply in nature, thorough, but like any business, a lot more work in real life compared to how easy it sound in paper.Gary Nakauchi"
5,Great book,"This is a great book for anyone just getting started. A lot of basic, useful information. Very easy and quick to read. Good resource book."
4,Good advice for opening a concierge service,"Lots of good, practical advice about beginning different types of concierge service. A very useful resource."
1,"Not for me, sorry.",This book is NOT for the one-man/woman small errand running services. It is really geared toward a MUCH larger operation. I found the book no help at all and a great waste of my money. Perhaps I should have done extensive research before ordering it- lesson now learned.
4,Just a Sailor,"As a former Navy Photographer (PH2 before Watermans time) I throughly enjoyed his wondering through his Navy life. I remember the A and C schools being much the same as he described and got the ""feel"" of his underwater training and activities just if I had been there. Steve has grasp the real feeling of his Navy life and demonstrates it quite well to the reader. If you are offended by a few ""blue"" words this may not be your reading delight but if you want to see the world through a Navy Photographer/Divers eyes, this is one to read!"
4,Just a Sailor--A must read,"If you love adventure, the Navy, photography and diving, ""Just a Sailor,"" by former Navy photographer/diver, Steve Waterman, is a must read. ""Just a Sailor"" is a no non-sense account of what it's like to serve as an enlisted man in the U.S.Navy with the elitist of the elite. It's a story that any Sailor, particularly enlisted people will be able to relate too. It's a story of hardship, travel, low pay, dangerous work environments and combat. ""Just a Sailor"" details how a veteran Navy man who truly loved the Navy and the many adventures it offered, foresaw the approaching era of political correctness and decided to leave the Navy. It is one of the best books I've ever read dealing with the pre-PC Navy. Waterman has painted a vivid picture of what Navy life ""used"" to be like.Art Giberson, Author of ""Photojournalist,"" ""Blue Ghost: The Ship That Couldn't Be Sunk"" and ""Eyes of the Fleet: A History of Naval Photography"""
4,"Excellent on the bonus features, but very bad on the quality","The features on this DVD does make it a PLAT|NUM Edition. But, the quality of the movies' image is not. Pacting 3 versions of the movie on 1 disc, it suffers MPEG2 compressions. There are a lot of artifacts if you look carefully. Also, I hate the fact that they advertise ""Original Theatical Edition"" while they modified some little parts and used the soundtrack of the IMAX re-release.Apart from those little (or big for some people) things, it's a great set. Wish they've put everything on 3 discs and gave us the real ""Original Theatical Edition""."
5,"Ooh, look at all the colors!","I have owned ""Beauty and the Beast"" on VHS for 10 years now, in the form of the special collector's edition. It's been watched more than ever though, since the birth of my daughter, who is now 2. One of hers and our favorite movies, we saw the Special Edition IMAX at the beginning of this year. Needless to say, we were excited to get the DVD at its release. We put it in the DVD player, turned it on, and the first thing my daughter said was, ""Ooh, look at all the colors!"" It's amazing to see this film on DVD and in letterbox. The colors are amazing and the letterbox makes every scene have something new. I HIGHLY recommend this DVD."
5,Deal,I love buying blue ray discs that have another DVD version with them (one copy at my house and one at my parents). This is my favorite Disney movie.
4,A great movie... but we have boys.,"My husband and I both watched this movie when we were young and wanted to get it to pass along to our boys. Unfortunately they are still young enough that they were not terribly interested in this movie. It's a classic so definitely worth adding it to the collection, but don't expect it to be watched over and over again if you have young boys."
5,Must Have for Parents,"The first time my daughter saw snippets from this movie was at my cousin's wedding - at 1 year old, she was captured and mesmerized by the music and film snippets. My own little Beauty deserves nothing but the best - and a Platinum Edition is a timeless classic ... just like that magical moment of her watching those snippets that night."
5,beauty and the beast,"When i was little i would watch this movie over and over, but after letting a young cousin borrow it i never got the movie back. I recently purchased it and it is just as good or even better than it was when i was little. Watched it twice the day i got it and it brought back alot of memories. Plus there is an extra song they put in the movie that is great, but had me scratching my head because i could not remember it. heh. A must for any Disney dvd collection! Classic!"
4,DVD DEAL OF THE MONTH,"SO far this was one of my 1st purchase's and it was gift for my wife and this movie is in the Disney Vault so buying it at a lower price is like winning the lottery, I was expecting to get this dvd about now but it took only 4 days and was completely satisfied and could not ask for anything better I would DEFINITELY buy from this seller again!!!"
5,Another Disney Classic,Blood and Sunlight: A Maryland Vampire StoryI saw this movie on my first date and I remember thinking I can't believe I'm watching a cartoon but I loved it. And it continues to be great today while some other Disney blockbusters have sort of gone by the wayside. It's the music- you don't have to know the movie to be familiar with the wonderful songs that came out of this. Some of the early CGI seems a little hokey now but it's a terrific adapation of the fairy tale. A few pretty intense scenes early on with the beast and when he's attacked later that may be a bit much for the smaller guys.
5,LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!,"It came the next day and was waiting in my mail box! This movie is fantastic. If younever saw it as a kid, you didn't have a childhood."
5,Classics,"This is a very great movie, disney at its best. One of my all time favorites. A excellent family movies. A++!!"
2,The Remastered Edition looks different,"I love Beauty & the Beast! It is one of my favorites, but in the re-released edition, the animation looks HORRIBLE. I still have my video from when it came out the first time and the animation on it looks great, but I was incredibly disappointed with the DVD. I thought it would look better and clearer than the video, but I was wrong. It looks like a cheap cartoon instead of the masterpiece it was."
3,Quick order but.....,"I received my order earlier than what I expected which was awesome but I was expecting a REAL copy. Don't get me wrong, the DVD looked good on my television but I definitely can tell it was not the original DVD cover not the original DVD. My friends even could tell! I collect Disney movies and was disappointed in this one."
4,loved it..but...,I loved the Movie. But the new movie with the new scene the the color is bad. Also I had problems with the second disc not working. I have tryed disney and the place (not amazon[.com]) that I bought and none have gottne back to me on dic two not working. The only thing that is good about the new movie is that they have a not of behind the scene stuff. which I like.
3,DVD,Product only worked in one of my DVD players. Im not sure why. I did not ask seller for a refund or exchange due to the fact that it worked properly in one of my DVD players.
1,Very Poor Quality DVD,"The movie is one of the best Walt Disney movies created in my opinion. I was very excited to purchase this movie for my 2 year old daughter, only to be disappointed. The quality of the DVD I received was awful. The DVD came in a blank sleeve not even the right movie casing (no movie casing). I paid full price for a poorly burned DVD. Also, the entire movie has captions on the bottom of the screen that are permanently there for the entire movie taking up most of the screen. I am very unsatisfied with the seller of this product. I expected a lot more for what I paid and I am expecting a full refund from the seller."
1,watch out for pirated dvd!,"The timeless story of Beauty and The Beast gone bad. I bought this from a seller 'jadniv' and I believe it to be a copy of the movie. The quality of picture, color and action poor. Scenes move forward and backward etc. When I received the dvd and opened it there was no ads or flyers etc in it. All signs point to a pirated dvd."
1,pirated copy of Disney's DVD sold off to pass as the original!,"i bought the platinum edition DVD of Disney's ""Beauty and the Beast"" from the seller known as ""Limeyman"", in May.It was so obviously a pirated copy, as printing for the cover art and accompanying booklet were all grainy and dull-coloured (the booklet wasn't even stapled together and was incomplete, with just a couple of badly printed pages loosely folded together!)Worst of all, both the enclosed discs could not be played AT ALL on my Macbook. And the irony was that i had watched the exact same movie twice already on the very same computer (but it was an original version, loaned by a friend)i have yet to receive my refund from Limeyman."
3,Beauty and the Beast,I did not like this product at all. Unless I don't understand what blu-ray is but it was mostly advertising to me even on the DVD itself. I will read the information on blu-ray and then decide if it is worth buying anymore of it is waste of money.
2,2-Disc DVD arrived with only one DVD,"Unfortuantely, the 2-DVD disc arrived packaged with only one DVD and as it stands will not be here in time for Hanukkah."
1,Bueaty and the Beast DVD,"I purchased this DVD for my grand daughter because she loves it so much. However, it will only play on 1 DVD player I have and that one is not one that she can watch all the time. The DVD player in her room and in the car will not play it. I believe that the problem is because it has been reproduced and not one out of th vault. I do not have this problem with any other DVD."
2,movie,it was a very very bad copy a burned disc of beauty and the beast!!!! the quality was not good at all.
3,Disney,"The video got to my home in wonderful time. There were a few ""glitches"" with the DVD but once you get past the first 30 minutes it gets better. The movie was purchased for a three year old-she does not see the Camcorder flashing at the top of the video during the beginning thirty minutes but she does get upset when the movie freezes during one scene and must be fast forward to get past it. Time delivery was awesome but the video was not ""like new""."
1,Never received,"I have been waiting for over a month for this movie, and I still have not received it. I wrote an email to Wayne's World but they still have not sent me anything back. I first tried to get this movie from Ebay, well I didn't get it. Then I tried to get it from Amazon, I still have not received it. So I don't recommend getting it from Wayne's World."
1,Beauty and the beast,I have not recived this Item and I e-mailed and called still no answer from seller and they have my money so I AM NOT TO HAPPY about this and want it fixed Thank You Lisa Burton [...]
1,Worst service ever,"This is the worst company I have ever done business with. I ordered a dvd on September 29, 08, and have not yet received it. I have contacted the seller three times but have not received any answer back. My suggestion to anyone - DO NOT USE THIS SELLER."
3,Beauty and The Beast Review,I think that this movie is well.I don't think it is my type of movie though.Cause I like Action movies!
1,Damian's Corner (DONT ORDER FROM THEM),Well my Children wanted this movie so we ordered it in August and it is now November and I have yet to receive the DVD. I have contacted the seller( Damian's Corner)twice and got nothing from them. You would think that after all the neg feed back on the seller AMAZON wouldn't let them sell things anymore. I will never order anything from them again. I also wouldn't recommend them to anyone either.
4,Movie,My 21 yr old daughter asked for this as a Christmas gift and this was put in her stocking and really likes!
5,Best Disney Movie EVER!,"I almost wish I would have waited til the end of this year to buy this movie (when it's going to be re-released). When I bought this one on Amazon.com, I didn't realize Disney was taking it out of the vault in late 2010. However, I have no regrets buying this movie. The songs are fantastic. The dance scene for ""Beauty and the Beast"" in the ballroom is gorgeous...every little girls dream! Disney outdid themselves with this movie! It's definitely a must-have for any Disney lovers collection."
1,Video doesn't work.,"I received the video and immediately put it in, only to find that it doesn't work. IT continues to spit it out. It is not the machine, as other videos work. It is the second from this seller that doesn't work."
2,beauty and the beast,"The item was newly packaged, but has skips in it. Won't be able to use. this is not due to the seller, just a bad copy."
2,WHY MUST THEY MAKE EVERYTHING I LOVE 3D?,This is ridiculous. 3D seems to invade all the things I hold near. Apparently it's attacking my childhood this time.
2,pirate,"the movie arrived in its correct box but the cd looks bootleg. im not happy with that, albeit the movie plays fine. but still if i wanted a fake movie i couldve gone someplace else, not this guy. i think i just payed for the box, the art, one may surmise..."
1,Never received the product,Never received this DVD....ordered a month ago. Contacted seller and never heard a word back! Would never purchase from them again!!!
2,"A true Classic, but too scarry for little kids.","Classical Disney, full of magical adventure & heart-warming romance. But some of the scenes are very scary and not appropriate for young or sensitive viewers. Disney needs to do a better job of gently illustrating adventure without the explicit gore."
1,Review of purchase.,This was a terrible purchase. It was a copied version of a Disney Classic. A bad copy at that. Even the paperwork had terrible coloring on it. I thought I was getting an original Disney movie and I did not.
1,Not happy with,I'm not very happy with this purchase. It doesn't work half the time and I am to lazy to try and return it.
2,disappointed,"while viewing the dvd, it skipped in several places. I had to stop and start the dvd to make it progress to the next frame. I was disappointed in the dvd and I probably won't ever watch it again. It is too much trouble to return it."
3,Good Movie - Bad Disc,"Here's the thing - It's a great movie!!! Top notch! The discs have problems! Shabby! So is Disney listening yet? You'd think the ""Diamond Edition"" would be better quality. Hoping my replacement will be. By the way, if you're listening Disney - really glad of all the kudos you heaped on the animators, Ashman and Menkin, etc. Yet the only reference I heard in all the discs about Jerry Orbach was that (paraphrased) before that Law and Order thing he had been a big ""song and dance man"" (not broadway star, not Tony Winner) in the 60's (and none of the staff had heard of him). Fine - but in the Diamond (20th Anniversary) Edition couldn't they have said and ""now his voice is used on everything...the menu's...etc. I mean, come'on - he actually performed ""Be Our Guest"" at the Oscars. He's the only one of the main cast that's passed away. NOTHING? Did I miss it?"
5,No one persecutes crackpots like Gaston,"We rank this as our 4th favorite of the 41 animated Disney movies that we own. But it is also our #1 favorite Disney musical, with Petes Dragon being our #2 favorite Disney musical. The producers have created a tremendous total package here starting with the highly memorable and enjoyable music, to a wonderful story that includes charm, humor, wit and compassion.We had a lot of fun by gathering the family together to rank the 41 Disney movies we have that include some cartoon work. All the kids, ages 6 to 27, participated along with mother and dad. Peter Pan is no Codfish, we rank it #2. Lion King was selected number 1 of the 41 as the family favorite, but narrowly. Peter Pan was 2. Pete's Dragon 3, Beauty & the beast 4 and Sleeping Beauty 5."
5,Great Value at Wal-Mart,This is a wonderful DVD set. My kids love the special features and attached CD-ROM game. ...
5,Classic Disney film,"Havent seen this movie is over 10yrs, bought it for my niece. Couldnt believe how great this classic disney film is. Love all special features and the quality on blu ray."
4,Classic DVD,"I recently took my daughter to see Beauty and the Beast in 3-D. She loved it so much that I had to get her the DVD for the house. I bought it used online, it came in great condition and arrived quickly. I was very pleased."
5,"Fast Delivery, Excellent Quality","After searching through local stores in my area, I discovered that a lot of the Disney Classics are hard to come by. Most stores carry the same 2 or 3 movies, and their pricing is ridiculous. I was pleased to find this copy of Beauty and the Beast at such a reasonable price. I received the movie well before the expected shipping date that was indicated, and the package and product were in excellent, still-wrapped condition. I would highly recommend this seller. A+++"
4,Wonderful animated musical,"If there is one genre that Disney still dominates, that would be the animated musical. Dreamworks now rivals Disney when it comes to animated comedies; think Shrek, Over the Hedge and How to Train Your Dragon. But for animated musicals, nobody can even challenge Disney. And this classic take on the fairy tale is a good example why. Clocking in at just under 1.5 hours, this movie is part romance, part drama, part comedy, and all music. The scores are wonderful, spread out throughout the movie, and appropriately placed such that they do not distract from dialogue or action. As for this product, the video quality is perfect. It was also nice to see both the original film, and the intended, longer version with extra music. All in all, a great movie."
2,"Classic movie, bad color","They converted the movie to all computer generated, including the ""new"" scenes. The pixels are awful on the DVD. You can see the color seperation. After you notice, it is hard to ignore. otherwise the same great movie as always."
5,Well satisfied,I bought this movie for my wife because it was her favorite growing up. The fact that it has all the versions it does she can watch it anywhere.
5,beauty and the beast dvd,"possibly the best disney movie ever! I purchased this for our 4 year old daughter and she loves it. However, like with all disney movies, the scary scenes are a bit much for her to handle by herself. And - again like with all other movies - and age appropriate :-) - it sparks about a thousand questions... Great movie, I don't mind watching it over and over. Music is fabulous too!"
1,Beuty and the Beast,The product I received was late and defective. I probably would have rated it higher had it worked.
1,Disappointed,I can not believe this seller. First they give you a timeline of about a month and they never even send it. Do not buy from them. I just filed a claim to get a reimbursement through Amazon. I emailed dellparts and got no response what so ever. Ridiculous.
3,Kind of dark and disturbing if you think about it,"This movie is twisted when you think about it:1. The prince really learns no lesson at all, in the beginning he shuns the old hag (she is ugly) and is cursed to live as a beast and must love someone (presumably for who they are on the inside) but Belle is constantly referred to as the most beautiful girl in the village. The prince learned to fall in love with a beautiful girl, what a challenge.2. The candle is an adulterer. One of the songs has a line stating ""....husbands beware..."" is that really something kids should hear?3. The witch in the beginning turns everyone, even innocent children like Chip into household items and possibly going to let them live like that forever? That is pretty cruel and does not make sense.Overall, its a decent Disney movie, but certainly not the greatest that everyone seems to proclaim it to be."
5,Wonderful As Ever,"My husband loves Beauty and the Beast. We have it on VHS, but the tape is dying (FINALLY!) so this release was very timely for us. I bought it for him for Christmas, and I am sure he will absolutely love it :)"
4,Blu-ray Version is Awesome,"I am reviewing the Beauty and the Beast Diamond Edition that contains the Blu-Ray version, the DVD version and a Bonus disc. I have only watched the Blu-ray version so far but I am very impressed with how this movie looks in all its 1080P splender. If you like Beauty and the Beast and want to see it in HD, it is definitely worth it.The only complaint I have is that I had to return the first one I received. For the first time ever, I received a bad disc. When it would get to about the 10th chapter it would start skipping chapters. I inspected the disc and cleaned it even though there were no apparent dirty spots. I even power cycled my PS3 and played it and it would consistently start skipping chapters in the same spot. The second one I received played perfectly in my PS3 so I can only assume the disc was bad."
5,disney classic,this was a very good classic 3d movie.a great family movie that all will enjoy.the 3d was pretty good alot better than the 3d in some other movies.
5,Beauty and the Beast -- classic Disney,"Rewatching this for the first time in years drove home what a great movie it is -- not just a great kids movie, or animated movie, or Disney movie, but an all around great film. The specials and featurettes are a nice addition to a more-than-bare-bones set."
3,Beauty and the Beast,"There is a little video symbol in the top right corner that doesn't go away. It is very annoying, and I am not sure why it is there."
2,disc skips,"I was excited to finally receive this movie, after finally finding it for a decent price. However, I'm currently watching it and although it's only been on for little over a half hour it has skipped at least 4 times. I tried cleaning it off and it still skipped in the same spot. Gave it 2 stars because shipping was decent, but disappointed that I can't watch it uninterrupted."
1,"Flawed DVDs, even when authentic!","I ended up trying two differentBeauty and the Beastdiscs (purchased directly through Amazon, and definitely the real Disney article) and found a serious play flaw in the same spot in each. Each disc cut off the end of the same scene when watched in ""original theatrical release"" mode. When we tried ""extended release"" mode, they finished the scene, but then jumped back to the beginning of the movie! Amazon was great to deal with re: replacement/returns, but when I asked about maybe trying a different lot, Amazon's answer was that only option open to me was to try purchasing through someone else. Buyer beware! There are a bunch of other versions available, so don't bother with this one."
3,"call me biased, but...","I was eight years old when Beauty and the Beast first came out, and I must say, I prefer the old video version to this new DVD. I watched the DVD the other night while I was babysitting. There's a song in it called ""Human Again"" that wasn't in the first release. I could see why they cut it. Except for the kind of touching little scene with Belle and the Beast reading, that corny song was unnecessary. Also, I dunno if this was due to the TV or not, but the colors seemed too rich, too bright (i tried adjusting the TV, but the colors still didn't look right). I remember the colors being much softer, not so intense. The DVD version of the movie looked too much like a TV cartoon rather than feature film animation. I did like the sound, though. Unless you're a huge fan of the movie and want to see the extras included in the DVD, I suggest searching for the old release of the video (that is in good condition) in a used video store."
5,An unforgettable Classic!,"Beauty and the Beast is one of the best Disney movies, which makes it a classic. Other great Disney movies includes Toy Story, Toy Story 2, and Mulan. Other than that, this is my favorite Disney film. It's too bad that they no longer sell it--I personally don't have a copy of this :( The only way I could see this again was to borrow it from my local public library (yes, they lend out videos there). Again, this movie is enchanting, captivating, beautiful...a true Classic!"
5,Beauty and the Beast,"My favorite Disney movie! There's love and romance, humor, and darkness but most of all to me this movie is all about hope. I never watch it without coming away feeling like anything is possible."
3,Not the best picture quality,"Very fast shipping. Picture quality dragged a little. I'm not sure if it is the dvd or because it is a remake. Ok, not great."
5,movie night,I bought this movie and planned a movie night since the kids have never seen it. They enjoyed the movie and it was in new condition. rec'd VERY quickly. I would buy from this person again.
1,Terrible,"I received the DVD that didn't even look like it was in it's original wrap even though it was supposed to be ""NEW"", the dvd skipped throughout the movie and then when I brought it to the attention of the person who sold it to me they threatened to black ball me! I still have the emails to prove it. SO IF YOUR SMART NEVER ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY."
1,it would help if you received the item,Considering i have YET to receive this movie after 6 weeks! i can't give a review -- i'm pissed!
1,Beauty & the Beast DVD,This DVD had scratches on it or something because it skipped really bad. This was a Christmas gift for my grandedaughter and she (and I ) were very dissapointed in the quality of the product. You expect something new to function properly. I will be returning it and hopefully will get a rplacement one that works right!
1,the movie is not real,i bought this thinking it was the original but its a fake its not originalcan somebody please help me with this matter!
1,Horrible customer service,"It seems at this point that all the previous reviews sum it up, no comments needed...but since I am so unsatisfied I will go ahead and vent. I ordered my dvd on Sep. 15th and it was not post marked till Oct.1st(shocker).I FINALLY received my movie today.By looking at the movie it is obviously a copy, guess that's why there was a ""delay"" in shipping.You need to Stop blaming media mail for everything, your customer service royally sucks!!!Thank you for my refund Amazon:)"
1,Bootleg copy,"I bought this DVD and it turns out it is a pirated copy. It constantly glitched while watching the movie, and when I called Disney, they told me it was a pirated DVD because they don't print the movie name in the back of the disk. I'm very dissatisfied, especially after spending over $50 to get this disk."
2,Definitely Disappointed,"I just watched the new blu ray of B&B and something was just WRONG.I was a child when I saw this for the first time in theatres.I watched this on vhs almost every weekend growing up.Im now a preschool teacher.My 2 yr olds always ask to watch ""Beast"" on movie day so we roll out the vcr cart.So of course I was extremely excited abouut a re release but the animation is just OFF.The colors are definitely not right.I dont know the technical name for the change but it seemed like some scenes were from the original while others were animated cheaply and cartoonish.I think Ill just buy a dvd alone version.Anyway who is familiar with this movie would notice the artwork is different in a bad way."
2,Wrong message to kids,"This movie is my daughter's favorite Disney film. It is also the one animated Disney picture I will never own. The message in this movie is that your ill-tempered, immature, violent boyfriend will change if you just love him enough. I don't want my daughter or her twin brother to think that abuse on any level - verbal, physical, psychological, etc. (all of which Belle tolerates) is ever okay. Especially not in a kids movie. Haven't we learned YET that childhood - early childhood - is where seeds are planted??"
2,Something WRONG,"Does anyone else find it disturbing that the ""beautiful"" witch turned a little boy (albeit selfish) into a monster? If you'll listen to the song ""Be Our Guest"", you will find out that they've been rusting in the castle for ten years. And considering that the magical rose withers completely on his 21st birthday, I find it unbelievable that anyone could justify the actions of the beautiful witch....who had nothing better to do with her time than pick on an 11 year old boy. I don't know about you, but I would advise MY children not to let strangers into the house either."
1,What the?,"This thing [stinks]! Don't buy this whacked thing!I thought it would be goog, boy was i wrong!"
2,Beauty and the Beast,"Yep, Disney animation. All my students see this movie at some point between leaving high school and when I meet them as university students. Sometimes, their Chinese university teachers show it to them in class. So, I thought I'd see why they love it so much. I'm still wondering. This is a two-page short story, not a film. But on the bright side, if you skip all the songs it's under an hour. I've never enjoyed a singing toon in my life."
5,The Best Movie Ever??,"Perhaps so. It's certainly my all-time favorite. One of the keys to B&tB's success is that it fills so many roles:musical, romance, comedy, and even action/adventure. It is simple enough for the kids to enjoy, yet engrossing enough for the adults to enjoy. It is, after all, ""The most beautiful love story ever told."" If you haven't seen it, watch it. If you don't own a copy, buy it. Quickly, because they're going fast."
4,Commenting on 3D Quality Only,"I was dreading watching this movie in 3D as I had ordered this along with the Lion King, and was very disappointed in the 3D quality of the Lion King. However, I was pleasantly surprised that the 3D quality of Beauty and the Beast was much better than the Lion King. Yes, there was a bit of ghosting and some of the 2D layering effect, but overall it was fairly well done, considering it was a 3D ""retrofit"" and not done in 3D originally. If your budget only allows for 1 Disney 3D movie and you are trying to figure out whether to buy this one, or the Lion King, I'd recommend this one (at least on the basis of the 3D--you would have to decide which story you like better.)What really throws me is that both movies were released at the same time in 3D, and the 3D quality is so different."
5,Like it was meant to be-- in 3D !!,"WOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOW!! All I can say is that it was like this movie had been made just yesterday specifically for the 3D format. The Chandelier hanging from the ceiling during the ballroom dance scene will take your breath away. The entire first song where Belle is making her way through the town sets the pace and continues to deliver all the way through the movie...from a checkerboard hurtling your way to a knife poking a character as you slide with it down the banister...Beauty and the Beast is probably one of the best 3D movies I have seen in this format. The best part is at the end when Beast is transforming into a human, the lighted floor REALLY LOOKS REAL due to the intense 3D Visual.A must own for any 3D OWNER!!"
2,Horrible colors!,"I grew up on this movie, and frequently still watch the original VHS that I have kept from my childhood. The colors in this new one are not only much more vivid (as expected) but have been transformed into bright pink and green all over the background of the film. They even went as far as changing the color of Belle's eyes. She was one of the the few princess figures from traditional Disney who had brown hair and brown eyes, but now she has hazel eyes. It is a small thing, but part of what made the film so great was the mundane beauty of Belle. Disney transformed the original film into something aimed even more so at little girls and has reinforced the culturally false ideals that beauty cannot be mundane. Way to go Disney."
5,Extremely Delighted,"Not only did I receive my order promptly, but It was everything I'd hoped it would be. I feel I received lots of value for the purchase price. It had been years since I had seen Beauty and the Beast, so it was a huge delight to see it again, and it seemed even better than I remember."
4,It's a Good DVD!,"Beauty And The Beast is one of my favorite Disney movies, I don't like it as much as I like The Little Mermaid, Snow White Or Cinderella but it is a very good Disney movie and is one of my favorites and it's in my top 5 and it's worth owning the DVD and watching all of the different versions of it and it has some good extras though I didn't enjoy all of the extras, if you are a fan of Disney movies I recommend this DVD for your collection!"
5,Oh the Extras!,This is a wonderful DVD. It is beautiful to watch and hear! The story is classic and the DVD treatment is worthy of the film. The extras on the DVD are INCREDIBLE and plentiful. This is a DVD that reminds you why DVDs are around in the first place. A must have for your DVD collection!
5,A Classic You Need to Own,I loved this a child. I saw it recently and remembered why. The music is wonderful. The story is enchanting. I can't wait to see it on blu-ray.
4,Beauty & the Beast DVD,"The product arrived very timely. After watching it a few times, it started to freeze up at the same spot each time. I can get back to the menu and just go past that point, but I can't fast forward past it while watching it."
5,Excellent seller,Great service. Quick delivery. Brand new condition as promised. Would definitely purchase from this seller again.
2,Beauty and the Beast,Pre order said it was new but when recived it had a Snow White security label the DVD turned out to be a burned copy of the original DVD. Some parts of the movie freeze up color quality is not so well. I own the original DVD picture quality is alot brighter than this purchase.
4,Good value and good experience,The item arrived shortly after the order had been placed and was in superb condition. A good value from a good seller. It makes my kids very happy and me too.
5,Great Stuff!,"I was very impressed with the response time and the actual product! Dammy contacted me and sent the DVD right out. My daughter isn't sure that she likes the ""Scary Beast"", but she loves Belle and Chip, so I think she'll come around. I woould recommend Amazon and Dammy Books to all."
5,The Magic Comes to Life...!,"Oh man! This special edition is truly a great Magic!I loved the movie from the first time a saw it (a few years ago), and then when I saw the musical in London.But this is just amazing! And the Extras are just great!Love the song Human again, was so right to put it in the musical, and then in the movie!Great Movie! Great Edition! If you are Disney's fan, this is one to own for life!"
5,The best Disney film of all time,"If ""The Little Mermaid"" was evidence that Disney was back, ""Beauty and the Beast"" was proof that it was better than ever.What a wonderful, beautiful, romantic film, punctuated by great animation, and knock-em-dead musical numbers. No wonder this was the first animated film nominated for a Best Picture Oscar!Not many animated films qualify as date movies, but this one is a date flick extraordinaire.If ""Beauty and the Beast"" has a flaw, it's that it can be quite violent for children. It includes a rather violent fistfight to the death, a knifing, and quite a bit of gunplay to boot. Thankfully, it's easy to see the scary stuff coming, so you can have your kids turn away before they see something they shouldn't.Overall, though, what else can I say? This film is a classic, and a wonderful moviegoing experience. I recommend it most highly."
5,A Classic and a Favorite,"I'm one of the people who happen to think this was Disney at its best. When I was young, this was one of my three favorite Disney films. It was one of the first films I was introduced to, and, naturally, I am very excited about the Special Edition; I hope Disney releases the Special Editions for the other two that I like just as much; Aladdin and The Little Mermaid. I considered them a trio of the same type of animation. . .or similar anyway. I miss this type of quality animation from Disney, and it's awesome that they're releasing this, with tons of behind-the-scenes features. A big hand to Walt Dinsey Pictures for this one. Let's hope there are more like it to come. :-)"
5,The Best Disney Film of all Time,"Run, don't walk, to see ""Beauty & The Beast"" at an IMAX near you - before it goes away and ends up in DVD this October. A grand film of multidimensional power, this Beast will literally sweep you up and lift your spirits for days. Who knew Robbie Benson had such a powerful voice as the Beast? And yes, the extra scenes are fun. More than that, however, has Disney EVER created such a 3-dimensional animated film? NEVER. This is one for the record books - the best Disney musical of all time!"
5,I can't wait for the DVD!,"When I first bought a DVD player I was so dissapointed that this great movie was not published yet on DVD. I have been waiting for it to be released.It's hard to say enough about this great movie, great cast, wonderful music, and a great timeless story-line. It is in my Top 5 favorite Disney movies of all time..."
3,Good product,"This product arrived earlier than it was originally stated which was nice. The description of the item said that it was ""like new"" however, when I opened the package the disc had scratches COVERING the entire surface. I watched the whole video and it still worked fine. However I would not have purchased it had I known the disc was torn up. At least the movie still played fully and well!"
5,Beauty and the Beast Blue Ray,"This is definitely a great buy, you get all of the different options to watch it on or take it with you in digital format."
2,First DVD Great Condition BUT........,"I bought Beauty and the Beast from this seller, and the movie it self was in EXCELLENT condtion.....BUT....the second DVD that came with it, the special features....well that was in HORRIBLE condition....it had like a zillion scratches on it....i was not told that it was unplayable....the seller should have just stated that and i probably still would have bought it....for the simple fact i just wanted the movie....and since the 2nd DVD was in bad condition, well I think maybe it should have been a little bit cheaper.....so atleast the movie was in great shape!"
2,Disappointed,We were very disappointed that when we received this dvd that we were unable to get it to play on any dvd we or any other family member owned.
5,Disney Classic - A Must Have!,"Beauty and the Beast is a beautifully animated movie with a fabulous story and unbelievable songs! This movie is one of my Disney favorites. I remember being amazed at the animation when Belle and the Beast are dancing. The reflection effect from the marble floor was stunning. If you don't have this Disney movie in your collection or just have it on VHS, it's time to upgrade! I look forward to seeing it on blu-ray!"
5,The Best of New Disney,"What a movie, and what a set. You get the timeless tale of Belle and the Beast, and three versions of the film, in a great quaility set. It's worth owning whether you have kids or not. This is a must buy."
1,EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING PICTURE QUALITY,My family was really looking forward to the release of this DVD. When we played the movie for the first time we were horrified by the poor picture quality. The prominent horizontal black lines completely ruin the anticipated DVD EXPERIENCE. The image quality is far worse than my daughter's most abused VHS video. I would not recommend this as a DVD buy.
1,Not able to play,I am not able to play this DVD without the ability to change the language setting on my DVD player.
1,Pathetic Quality,"I have seen quite a few Disney movies ""remastered"" over a period of time that are just as old, if not older than this one. This one is hands down the worst quality I have ever seen for a Disney movie converted to DVD. My recommendation.. Don't waste your money if you want to enjoy the movie and go else where for this classic."
1,Woe to those who have Plasma Tvs,"I just bought the Beauty and the Beast Diamond edition and first thing I did was race home to watch it and what a disappointment! The blu ray edition looks terrible on both a plasma and LCD tv. The animation doesn't look hand drawn anymore its like DIsney is trying to convert the magic of the old disney films into the crappy animation of newer kids movies. The coloring wasn't bad and neither was the sound, its simply that it seems like the artistry of the original movie isn't in the new release. Luckily the DVD version looks good on a LCD tv but still not on a plasma. My parents have the original VHS release of this movie and I would rather watch it a million times over this ""newer edition"". I wish Disney would just leave their classic movies alone they were amazing in their original production. If it isn't broke, DON'T fix it!"
1,Beauty and the Beast Special Platinum Edition,"To date (February 16th---- two full months since we ordered this DVD!!), we have not received our order. And I have called Amazon about it . . . and they referred me to the vendor . . . and when I e-mailed the vendor . . . to date, we have received NO NOTICE or EXPLANATION regarding our order from the vendor.So I would call that VERY DISSATISFIED.And I will now have to contact Amazon again to see what can be done about this.Incidentally, this was a nearly $50 purchase that was made with Christmas in mind. When Christmas went by, we went for my child's 6th Birthday. The birthday (February 2nd) has now also come and gone.Again, VERY DISSATISFIED.Grace Saper"
2,Beauty and the Beast (Five Disc Combo: Blu-ray 3D / Blu-ray / DVD... Paige O'Hara,I didn't realize that we had to have a3D blue ray player when I bought this DVD. Package didn't mention we needed one.
1,Not the correct product,While excited about purchasing the product I received the wrong item. One disc was the 2nd disc of the set and the other was a game. I'm disappointed that I wasted my time in purchasing as well as having to send it back for a refund. I probably will think twice about purchasing a dvd online again.
5,Beautiful,"This video is absolutely beautiful. My children are enchanted by it. Both the blu ray for the tv and the standard dvd for the travel tv is spectacular. If you don't have this video, get it for your kids."
5,GREAT BUY!!!,I had been looking everywhere for this DVD and of course I got a good deal and great service from Amazon and it's affiliates.
5,One of my favorite movies,I love Disney movies and I love Beauty and the Beast. Have not owned it since it was on VHS so of corse the picture quality was a million times better. Cannot say anything bad about the movie!
2,Beauty and the Beast,"The dvd looked like it was a generic copy (the pictures on the cover and on the dvd looked like they were printed off of a home computer), but the dvd plays fine so I kept it. However, I'm not convinced that this is a genuine dvd that was distributed by Disney."
2,Poor quality remastering,"For a remastered version, this has been degraded in quality. For fans of Disney movies, let's talk quality for a moment: Remember the animation quality difference between ""The Lion King"" and ""The Lion King 2""? This remastering makes the quality more akin to that of ""The Lion King 2"" rather than being on par with such classics as ""The Lion King."" the colors are changed, everything is pinkish, the result is an unappealing film whereas the original was a beloved treasure."
3,"Animated, fun gift...","Bought this for my daughter who fell in love w/ the characters, Disney magic and music in this movie. Only issue is both DVD and Blu-ray disks pause/get stuck at the same scene in the movie, like there was an issue making the disks."
3,Technical Difficulties,"The blu ray discs did not work, I returned them and the replacement blu rays only had partial access. It was very strange. Paid extra and ended up watching the regular DVDs!!!!!!!"
2,Beauty and the Beast,"Referring to the DVD only, I did not like the color. Everything seemed to be overly reddened. Belle's dress, which was blue in the original, had a red tinge. Her hair, which was brown in the original, was red. It was as if they had painted over everything in red when they restored it.The story and the film are great and the music is fantastic. They could have done a better job of restoring it."
5,Classic Tale,"This all time classic Walt Disney film, will get your heart pumping withfeelings of joy and love. It will show you that love can be found in unexpectedplaces. This fairly tale takes place a long time ago. Belles father, aninventor, was on his way to a fair, but took a wrong turn and ended up at acastle. When he doesnt return home, Belle sets off to look for him, and in turnbecomes a prisoner in the ferocious beast castle, where its filled withtalking furniture, who in the end turn back into there human form. Now Belle nolonger has to look into books for an adventure, for she is on one of her own.As the two spend many days and nights together, Belle shows the beast how tolove. This amazing enchanted story is one for the whole family, with its magicaltouch and fantastic musicals."
5,A true magnificence,"Certainly this is a very effective film and the restoration was good, only a mite overdone. It needed a hell more extras but it wassn't horrible or anything."
5,The Greatest One of All!,"In my opinion, this movie was the best Disney movie ever made!It's one of those movies that you can watch over and over again without getting sick of it. Beauty and the Beast is an all-time classic and I'm so happy that it is finally coming out on DVD. The characters in this film are well portrayed and the musical features are fantastic! I cry every time I watch it and I can't wait to get it! It's definitely on my Christmas list!"
2,"Bad blu-ray, DVD works fine","I purchased this item as a gift for my daughter. We started watching the Blu-ray together and had to keep advancing the disc because it kept freezing. I finally started it over again and it stopped at the same places as the first time. After three more tries, we ended up putting in the DVD and that worked fine. Since I purchased this as a gift and didn't use it right away, I am already out of time to return it... does anyone know how to get in touch with Amazon to get this corrected? I only need a replacement on the Blu-ray and not the DVD."
5,A Classic!,"As soon as I heard that Beauty and the Beast was being released from the vault, I was ecstatic - and bought both myself a copy as well as my one year old niece (for future use, of course). I loved every minute of watching it again as an adult rather than a child...and since I am 29 years old, it had been a very long time since I had seen it. What I do not like is the whole Disney idea of being ""in the vault."" I think all movies should be available because children are being born all the time and when movies are in the vault, a whole generation of children could miss out on great movies, like Beauty and the Beast. The movie itself - well worth every dime. :-)"
1,Disappointed grandchild,"I ordered the Platinum version DVD of Beauty and the Beast from HorseCrazy. The sound raced and was so distorted we couldn't watch it, and my grandchildren were very unhappy. I sent three emails to the vendor and haven't gotten a reply. I certainly won't do business with HorseCrazy again."
3,not quite new,"Searching for a Christmas gift for my niece I thought I found the perfect gift with this Disney dvd. However, while it is shrinkwrapped and unopened, there was no outer artwork which is standard in Disney dvds."
1,loose dvd,The dvd was in the wrong case it was sliding around in the case because ther wasn't enought space for it and the bonus dvd .
2,Beauty and The Beast,"I Rec'd CD very quick,However the CD was so scratched and a very poorly made copy of movie that I could not watch it. Seller gave me a full refund as several e-mails"
3,Badly implemented bonus features READ!,"The movie looks good in blu-ray. Unfortunately, there is a major problem with the bonus features: during the ""untold story"" features, you cannot rewind or fast-forward the playback. If you missed something, you have to restart the entire section from the beginning to see it again. These limitations make it impossible for me to enjoy the bonus features. You don't do bonus features this way. EVER. This is an elephant in the room that most people who review this product have ignored and it's very important to know."
5,Its Beauty and the Beast!,"A lot of my friends have pointed out that this movie teaches little girls that you can 'change an awful abusive man into the man of your dreams', to which I always respond 'Don't ruin my childhood you stinkin jerks' This movie is great! For the very very small group who hasn't seen it yet, then watch it! It's well worth it."
1,A shame to the Disney Company,"This movie is less than par, in fact not even sub par. Leave it to disney to ruin a timeless classic such as this story. The animation is very very poor, the acting is regrettable, and the sound and picture quality are that of an old worn out tape."
3,It's Okay but I Regret Buying The DVD!,"This Disney Beauty and The Beast movie is okay though I regret buying this DVD!The movie was nice to watch once but compared to ther Disney movies it just doesn't hold up to repeated viewings and gets a little boring.Definitely not as good as Snow White, Cinderella, and The Little Mermaid!I think I'm going to have to sell or trade this DVD!"
2,Blu Ray edition stiinks,"I have been trying to navigate my way around the second disc of this movie for two days, its impossible . How could kids even find the games let alone play them. And why do Blu Ray discs take FIVE MINUTES to start. Even pushing buttons to hurry it up, it takes forever staring at blank screen. No wonder blu ray is struggling in the market place. It just aint worth the hassles and now it seems it is becoming hard to return to a scene, turn off the disc for five minutes and you need to go back to square one. Nuts. !!! Blu Ray is over rated and will soon be replaced by a more expedient version."
3,Beautiful Good Benevolent Witch,"Does anyone else find it disturbing that the ""beautiful"" witch turned a little boy (albeit selfish) into a monster? If you'll listen to the song ""Be Our Guest"", you will find out that they've been rusting in the castle for ten years. And considering that the magical rose withers completely on his 21st birthday, I find it unbelievable that anyone could justify the actions of the beautiful witch....who had nothing better to do with her time than pick on an 11 year old boy.You should never let strangers into the house, even if they're carrying magical beautiful roses."
1,Beauty and the Beast (Disney Special Platinum Edition),I was stuck with a bad copy and nothing has been done about it as of yet.
1,garbage,"walt disney would turn over in his grave at the terrible transformation of his classical animated cartoon format. the drawings, animation and dialogue are not disney. someone is obviously trying to recreate disney into another dimension, with little success i might add. all disney productions of late reflect this error in judjment. the classical style that disney created will pass the test of time. the new format will not."
3,not satisfied,it is a great movie that i enjoyed when i was younger but this particular dvd i recieved was a little scratched and it skips and freezes in the middle of the movie. so i would buy it new!!!
3,"Well, I'm not sure how I feel about this edition . . . .","I love this film. Saw it so many times in the theater that I'm surprised my wife of then six years didn't dump me. As many have said, the colors are beautiful; there is depth to the multi-layered scenery; the sound is great. However, I'm having an issue with the picture quality on the animation. When there is a long shot, everything is fine, but when there is a close-up of any character it seems there is a amall white ""outline"" around any ink-line within the character's figure. We have a 50"" plasma 1080, so it's distracting. Is it just me and my set-up? Anyone else notice this?"
5,A classic!,"My little toddler granddaughters love this movie. After the first time of ""talking through"" the scary parts, they were not afraid of the beast anymore."
3,Remastering the colors was a mistake,"The movie is one of my favorites, and a complete classic. I'm not reviewing the film, but rather, the product.The colors have been drastically altered from their original versions, and it's really horrible. They made the colors so over-saturated that I had to dim my screen by half- and they still were too bright.The reds are no longer the rich rusts they were- but rather a glaring fire-engine red. I got out my old VHS tape, and the colors are so much better than this. I don't know who was in charge of remastering the colors of this glorious film, but they were so heavy handed that they really ruined some scenes visually. 'Belle's Song' (the opening where they all sing bonjour!) was impossible to look at in some instances because of how bright the reds were.It's a shame that they did this to such a great film."
5,This is incredible,"This movie has always been a top favorite Disney classic of mine, so when I heard it was coming out on blu-ray I had to get it as soon as possible. This blu-ray disc is worth every penny. I expected this to be a great blu-ray. It didn't meet my expectations...it surpassed my expectations. From the second it started, I was blown away by the picture quality. I think that animated movies are the best looking blu-ray's, and this is one of the best. I would honestly out this in my top 3 favorite blu-ray movies of all-time. It is a brilliant movie and a brilliant transfer, and it is worth the investment of a blu-ray player. 10/10 on both the movie and the blu-ray quality."
5,Love it,Beauty and the Beast has such a great story and beautiful music. I had to buy it for my grandchildren. Great condition and prompt delivery
2,beauty and the beast,"im glad i got this movie although i can clearly tell it is a burned copy.I can tell by the cover and all the extra papers that are inside, they have been copied, as for the movie itself while watching it, it is really not clear and distorted just like when you burn a dvd and the big thing is the chapter symbol at the top right of the screen does not go away."
3,Good service... poor quality,"Product was processed and delivered in no time, which was a very big plus. However, for the price paid I was expecting an original film and not a recorded copy. The picture looks good but not worth the price paid.Will not recommend this product unless price is drastically reduced."
4,My kid liked it the first 20 times,"My three year old was on a ""Beast"" kick for about two weeks. He had to watch it everyday. He knew all the parts. I think that is a sign of a good movie. He is the target audience and he enjoys it. My wife likes it too, so I think it meets it's mark. The sound quality is great and the picture is good. There are some computer games and a game you can play from your DVD player. I think that means it has something for everyone."
5,My Favorite Disney Movie,"I absolutely love this movie. It's got everything anyone would want in a movie: Adventure, action, love, mystery, special effects, comedy and a great message: That everyone should be judged by who they are rather than what they look like. The DVD specials are also amazing and very entertaining, altough Chip's Challenge Game has been difficult at times. Overall, excellent!"
4,Used DVD Purchase,I purchased the DVD to give to granddaughter for her birthday. It arrived in time for the festivities. I didn't watch it to see if it played properly and nothing has been said so I assume everthing is cool.
4,"Touching, thought-provoking and powerful","This book is a private glimpse into the last months of an exceptional individual. Katie was a typical teenager in many ways (concerned about her appearance, boys and making friends). But, she was also an exceptional person, and it would have been a pleasure to have met her. My praise to Ouriou family for raising this beautiful person and for having the courage to share these moments with us. Thank you also to Heather, Maude and Ashley for sharing their memories of Katie. This book is a reminder that life can change in an instant, and it is important to cherish our life, and the people in our lives."
5,Worth the Read!,From page one I became enthralled with the charactors of this book. Amazingly enough is the fact that these are not charactors but real people. It is the true story of a girls last moments dialogued in her emails and letters to her friends. It reminded me alot of myself and my friends. I feel that many will identify with Katie. I know I did.
1,disappointing,Thought that this would be more of a Christian type of concert. Not that at all. Alot of slinky clothes and funky dancing. Difficult to understand most of the words in her songs.
3,Good Concert DVD,"Overall this is a pretty good concert DVD. Stacie has excellent potential moving forward. At this time, this is not quite in the same league as Hilary, Shakira, Kylie, Britney, Beyonce, et.al."
3,"Great reference for ""Hawiian Fishing Secrets""","A good read for the saltwater shore fisherman no matter where he fishes. However most of the material is specific for the Hawaiian Islands. A lot of detail in rigging for tackle busting fish. Covers tackle, technique, bait, chumming, and construction of homemade gear. A lot of fishing books include fishing from pier, boats etc. This is just from shore."
5,My favorite jazz album,"Raw, powerful, and fun to listen to. Illinois, organist Milt Buckner, and drummer Tony Crombie tear it up in Ronnie Scott's club in Soho, London in the late 1970s. Everyone I've played it for enjoys it. This is my favorite jazz album, I know every note by heart."
5,Polio and it's epidemics explained.,"This documentary did an excellent job of explaining the causes of the growing polio epidemics in the first half of the twentieth century. To think that public sanitation, which ended other deadly diseases, had a role in the increase of polio cases. It's a must see for anyone who remembers this scourge, or any historian."
5,Good overview on Polio,"Found this to be a very good view of the personal impact of Polio on the individual, family and community."
5,Excellent!!!,Champion book. Better than 70% of therapists for help with any and every issue/problem/diagnosis. Believe what this book tells you!
1,Worst headphones I've owned,"The first thing I'll say is that they are HUGE. I've had no problems fitting any of the headphones I have bought over the years in my ears. The iPod earbuds fit just fine, these are HUGE and don't fit my ear. It hurts to even put them in. Luckily I didn't have to worry about that because BOTH pairs were deffective right out of the box. Stay away from this crappy product and get something else for a couple more dollars."
2,"Cheap, mostly functional, uncomfortable","Unfortunately, these earbuds don't really fit in my ears. Even without the little fuzzy covers, I can't quite get the buds to stay in far enough that it doesn't feel like they are constantly slipping out of my ears. I've never had this problem with other headphones. Beacuse of this, I can't really judge the sound quality -- they sit only sort of half in my ears, so need to blast the output to hear things at a normal volume. Having two sets for a low price doesn't make up for all of this."
2,Not worth the money,Only good thing on these is the price for two. Too big for your ears and sound quality is bad. You get what you pay for.
3,Just OK,"You get what you pay for. The quality of the sound seems fine, but I cannot get them loud enough to really test them. I bought these for my 2 small children, so that they could listen to their dvd on car trips. They seem to like them ok, although the buds are a little big. But when I tried to listen to music with them, I could barely hear."
2,"Large, uncomfortable and very quiet","These earphones are considerably thicker than most, making it hard for an adult to put them into the ear, and impossible for a child. I also found them much quieter than all other earphones I have used, forcing the volume to be adjusted way up and even then, its hard to hear. I guess you get what you pay for. These were very cheap and perform accordingly. I would pass on these and spend another $5 per set to get some truly functional earphones."
4,Sitchin Mixed With Icke And Cremo,"This book builds yet another case for humanity being ""created"" by an ET race for its own purposes. The book takes elements from both Sitchin but with more a David Icke take on who the Nefilim really were (and still are).Particularly interesting because the author was a member of acadamia who now rejects the theory of evolultion (which he used to teach) and gives some solid arguments against it.A good well-prepared read with the only criticism being that the section dealing with religion was highly speculative and weaker than the rest of the book."
5,Great Recording! Good Sound for an ADD source!,"Holst's ""The Planets"" ranks among my favourite classical pieces ever and this version by Mehta and the LA Philharmonic is the best version I've heard. In addition, the sound quality is quite good given the age of the recording and the fact that it comes from an analogue original source and so I can only imagine how much better this would be if it ever gets a remastering job from the best master tapes in Decca's vault.Another reason why this cd deserves 5 stars is the fact that you get John Williams' ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind Suite"" and the ""Star Wars Main Title"" tracks here as well. It's just a stroke of inspiration putting these similarly-themed pieces on one disc.Probably the best version of ""The Planets"" overall that you can get out there and at an unbelievably low price. Great value, good sound, great track selections.Highly recommended."
5,"'A GIANT INFLUENCE ON PROGRESSIVE ROCK""","Holst The Planets was a universal awakening for progressive rock musicians during the early 70's. Mars, the bringer of War turns up on King Crimson's The Devil's Triangle. Excerpts from Jupiter, Bringer of Jollity are found on NO OPPORTUNITY NECESSARY by Yes. The main melody is reproduced on Manfred Mann's Joybringer. The center section of Mars, Bringer of War is played by Lucifer's Friend on Summerdream. I have also heard snipets of Procol Harum and Univers Zero. I believe that David Bedford and Bernard Hermann were influenced as well. Holst the Planets is very educating and musicians have been studying the work for decades. John Williams compositions for the Star Wars Trilogy is the most common example of just how influential Holst really was. A great buy!"
4,Not heard Zubin Mehta's performance,"Haven't heard Zubin Mehta's performance (I do like his work), but Holst's The Planets is a truly satisfying & inspiring listening experience.I've only heard it live once - at the Sydney Opera House by the Sydney Symphony / Edo de Waart(?) in the mid-late 1990s. Very impressive. It seemed to me I could almost touch the music in 'the air' (so to speak).So, without having heard this orchestra's performance, I do recommend it."
1,Terrible,"this CD has the Worst sound Quality I have Ever heard it sounds like it was Bootlegged on a Tape-recorder or maybe even recorded on a Cellphone , I say don't waste your time or money on this CD, Here I expected Great Classical Music and All I got was CRAP pure CRAP. NOT SURE BUT I THINK IT WAS PLAYED BY A FOURTH GRADE BAND CLASS ,TERRIBLE QUALITY TERRIBLE SOUND, TONS OF DEAD SPACE , DEAD AIR GALORE, THIS CD IS TOTAL CRAP , DON'T BUY IT !!!!"
5,"Wonderful! And with thanks to John Williams for introducing this listener to ""The Planets!""","I bought this CD after a Tanglewood concert a few years ago where John Williams, focusing on movie music including his own compositions, also conducted ""The Planets."" I recognized ""Jupiter"" as the theme music for a WQXR (the New York Times radio station) ""New York at 6"" program. It was a treat to find out where that piece came from. When I listened to this beautifully performed CD, I was pleasantly surprised to see Mr. Williams' movie music included -- a brilliant move on the part of this item's producers (just listen to ""Mars"" and then to ""Star Wars""). As another reviewer has suggested, it's not clear why his music was included, but there are similarities here which I'd love Mr. Williams to discuss some day. I've since become an avid amateur astronomer, and so the themes, musical and otherwise, projected in the works of Holst and Williams have become a special treat for the mind as well as the ear."
3,"""Jupiter"" crashes and burns!","This is a reasonably decent version of Holst's masterpiece, but there are many superior versions available at all price levels. ""A. Customer's"" 3-star review lists excellent alternative renditions (I own them all). I would also list Stokowski's interesting 1956 performance with the same orchestra on EMI.What really killed this for me was ""Jupiter."" the centerpiece of the suite and many listeners' favorite. At its' concluding climax, Mehta completely loses control of the orchestra, and the music disintegrates into a real train wreck. Think of the L.A. Philharmonic, all sections playing at full tilt, collectively falling down a flight of stairs.A great performance of ""The Planets"" cannot be without a great performance of ""Jupiter."" Check out the alternatives."
1,Huge Disappointment,I was hoping this book would be a collection of monologues for women from plays that directors might have heard of! It appears they are written by the author and most are not appropriate for a serious audition. Feel like I wasted my money here.
3,Good..but,"This book has good monologues, but if you are a serious acting student and need audition pieces this is not for you. These are mostly unknown pieces of work and can be used for ""working art"" while profecting your craft. However if you need audition pieces...keep looking"
3,"Timely, at least on one level","""Mulligans"" an austere, tight look at gay relationships, will never be among those ground-breaking gay films, but after viewing it, the film has some merit. Granted, the acting is almost as bad as the premise, but for gay dads who find themselves coming out...well, there are plenty of them to take some notice. Written by Charlie David, the younger attraction, it shows a fair amount of promise but not much perspective. In the hands of a more seasoned writer, ""Mulligans"" could have had more promise.The film is worth a look. But again, viewed from the father's point of view...the one who carries the weight of family and all the love and baggage that accompanies him... I give credit to actor Dan Payne, who plays the dad. He gives a plausible, thoughtful performance. ""Mulligans"" is a film that blends an awkward past with some semblance of hope for those trapped in marriages that cannot endure."
4,May December relationship from a gay point of view,"I thought it was well written and would like to see it again. Lots of drama and some suspence. The emotional twist was a little weak, but it worked. It causes me to wonder how many gay men, for fear, ended up in heterosexual relationships and fathered children, only to face up to their sexuality later in life. This film looks at what might happen with the betrayal and emotional damage that happens when the truth is revealed. It can be devastating for all involved. The cat is out of the bag. One can never go back in the closet."
3,Its is a predictable story,"You can acctually guess what is going to happen next , it is just a matter of time, before You gat on the script what You thought about it, it ends in a usual way, no surprises, the story goes in one line only, but it entertains."
2,sadly disappointing,"The potential story here is sullied by very poor storytelling. The characters are mere caricatures of people, we are ""told"" how we are supposed to feel by the constant insertion of melodramatic music, right on cue after certain ""pivotal"" moments, and the character transformations are superficial and scripted. This film comes across no greater than a typical Lifetime movie, and that's being generous. It's frustrating because both the reviews of others and the previews depicted a potentially good story line. And it had potential. It was just delivered in such a shallow manner that it fails to achieve more than the slightest of emotional impact, and little credibility to boot."
4,Mulligans,"I found this to be a very interesting movie. It seemed to be very well written, and a well made movie."
3,"Great Acting, OK Plot","The acting was top-notch and everyone in the movie did an astounding job; however, there were many points where I felt that the plot fell short of expectations and reality and played a bit too much to stereotypes."
4,GOOD MOVIE..,Well.. Sad..yet funny & freeing...Really cute guys.. THE DAD... SUPER CUTE...WOW WOW WOW..
2,disappointed,"After reading the book I decided to watch the movie and I did not like the movie at all, the movie did not live up to the book expectations. I hope the next time Charlie David decided to write another book and turn it into a movie please don't. If you know of any other gay authors like Charlie David, that has written a book and turned it into a movie please feel free to recommend it to me."
1,Mulligans- worst gay film ever !,"If ever there was a more ""corny"" badly acted, dull and totlly uninteresting film, it would have to be ""The Mulligans"" ! Don't waste your money on this American drivel. It is just soooo predictable, so totally unbelievable that it was a real chore to sit through it. DON'T BOTHER"
1,Can NOT recommend,"I have to say this is probably the worst gay film since BBM. It's plot is slow and boring, acting only mediocre, and the dad getting together with your best friend plot I actually found disturbing. I will give it this though, the cast was well picked, you will be hard pressed to find a movie with more good looking guys! Overall though I would say this movie's a complete dud."
1,your best friend is gay...and so is your dad. Hmmm.,"College student brings home his best buddy, who promptly comes out, causing the student's dad to realize HE'S gay too and the two of them start fooling around. I hate when that happens. Earnest and uninvolving."
1,Garbage,"This had to be one of the biggest pieces of garbage of ""gay cinema"" ever made. Boring, disgusting, amateur acting and just down right stupidity!!"
2,3 out of 4 ain't bad,Three of these movies were enjoyable should have been left on the cutting room floor. They say 1 bad apple won't spoil the whole bunch but if I have known about this one I'd have left the bunch alone.
2,own this one for Terfel,"This one doesn't compare to Giulini's landmark recording or Karajan's...Terfel is terrific and the rest of the cast simply cannot compete...Hampson bellows and bawls his way as usual...he is no match for the memory of Warren, Merrill or Nucci...save your $$$"
5,LASTS LONGER THAN THE BOX SAYS!!!,"I love this semi-permanent hair color. It has built in detangler so it makes it really easy to comb through. Excess dye washes right off of scalp, doesn't have an odor, and doesn't burn the scalp . My last application was about 4 months ago, so I can say that it did last longer than expected. Doesn't contain peroxide or ammonia so I applied after my relaxer and my hair looks amazing! I will continue to use this!"
4,6 years in the making...,"Great album. I'm giving it a 4 b/c nothing has topped 'City' before or after its release. By the way, this is Gene's second album. He debuted on 'City'; Devin used a drum machine on HAARHT."
5,A Pummeling Masterpiece!!!!,"Strapping Young Lad does it again with SYL. They continue to amaze and blow away anyone who has the guts to see what these guys are about. Industrial Metal has found a king, and this is probably the heaviest Industrial Metal band in the world. It doesn't get much heavier than this, the crushing guitars, amazing riffs, the screaming thrash metal type vocals, the drumming, the indutrial sound samples. This is just one incredible album. Fav. track is Relentless. It's pummeling, but then again, to fully appreciate that song, you have to hear the entire CD. Every song rules. It's one you put in, and it's an overwhelming attack on the senses. If you like this, get heavier music like Meshuggah's Chaosphere and/or Nothing."
4,WHAT METAL SHOULD SOUND LIKE?,"Whenever Devin Townsend decides to do a metal album, he deliver's it in a way that I question myself if this is what metal is supposed to sound like. Heavy lyrics with heavy sounds, however, it lacks leads. If you wanna hear leads, buy the new Lamb Of God album. If you wanna hear PURE HEAVY pick up SYL. Overall it was worth the 20 bucks. Oh yeah, and Gene Hoglan is an animal on drums!"
2,OH Hell!!,"I LOve heavy music but what the hell is this! These people just make one hell of a noise. OK, so Townsend is crazy, manic depressive etc etc, still doesnt make this noise cool!"
5,SYL's best BY FAR,"Everyone disagrees with me, but I think this is EASILY the best album Strapping Young Lad has done. This album is simply MORE true to the CONSUMMATE POWER of this band, which is best experienced at their unimaginably devastating live show (I was like four feet away from Lord Devin himself -- the man is UNREAL). When I finish listening to this album, I no longer feel like a man -- just a leaking sack of meat. If this review is barely coherent, that's YOUR problem. P.S. I'm a jerk, but _SYL_/SYL SLAUGHTERS, in my not necessarily humble opinion. No hard feelings. Ok, back to ""music is subjective"" mode."
4,cheesy,"I like this film and it was hard to find. i had it on VHS and then when my VHS machine decided to eat a tape and basically fall apart, it had to be this one. hansk alot. I hope this comes out on DVD soon."
3,So Bad you have to laugh at it!,"Yor travels to various different enclaves of civilizations in a post apocalyptic future and manages to obliterate them each in a matter of minutes. Really! You can almost set a watch to it it happens so often in this hilariously bad film. Along the way he slowly builds a band of friends/survivors and comes at last to a forbidden futuristic city (where he finds he actually came from but doesn't remember). Here there is a tyrant ruler who likes to gloat about his plans to his robot soldiers and wave and fling his cape dramatically. When they get a hold of weapons from a resistance force all the good guy's laser guns shoot green beams and the bad guy's guns shoot red beams. But get this! Even when they knock out a robot and get the gun - for them, it now shoots green beams! I guess they have a Good guy/Bad guy switch on them! I think I have to order this just to have a good example of how not to make a picture. Recommended even though I only gave it two stars."
1,This is the movie I base all crappy movies by.,"This movie has been a joke between me and friends ever since it came out. Whenever we see any other crappy movie we always say, ""At least it wasn't Yor!,"" then we burst out into laughter. Never have I seen a worse movie, and I have seen a lot. Nothing can compare to Yor's horrific plot, nor it's sad acting. Hell, just look at the the freaking box-cover art up there and you can tell what kind of crap is inside. Be glad this movie is not available anymore."
2,He's gonna make all those wild beasts look tame tonight!,"First off, let me make this clear: ""Yor"" is a terrible, terrible movie. Among the many abysmal ""Conan"" ripoffs in the 1980s, this is the ultimate full-scale stinker of the bunch. That being said, I love it. I once owned the soundtrack (on LP, needless to say), which included the immortal theme song. I even submitted the title to Mystery Science Theater 3000 as something they oughtta take a look at. And, after I moved to Austin, TX at the turn of the century, I knew I was where I belonged when I saw a ""Yor"" movie poster in the lobby of the Alamo Drafthouse.I would never, in a million years, buy this on DVD, but it's completely worth seeing: atrocious acting (by Reb Brown, the master), astonishingly bad special effects (flying creatures that are actually paper kites), and, of course, the legendary theme song (""Yor's world, he's their man, he's gonna make all those wild beasts look tame tonight!""). A masterpiece."
2,Horrible 80's Dreck,"If the opening soundtrack isn't enough to scare you off, I'm not sure what will. This is a pretty much plotless excercise in bad FX, melodramatic overacting and sci-fi imaginations gone bad. The vid begins as a caveman flick, soon we learn title character YOR exists in a time warp and futuristic high tech baddies appear. I'm not sure but I believe this was lensed in Italy. I am usually suspect of films with an abundance of non-Anglo names in the credits. Fight scene with laser guns in what appears to be a power plant is made even more pathetic by the bad Kraftwerk/Moroder/Vangelis synth rock."
1,i really wish mst3k had done this one,"i couldn't decide whether to give this 1 or 5 stars. it's so bad, it's fun to watch. the soundtrack is hilarious. it sounds like queen gone horribly wrong. a must see if you like cheesy movies."
5,Jing Chi Live!,"Great live fusion with extended jams featuring a great power trio--guitarist extraordinaire Robben Ford, drummer's drummer Vinnie Colaiuta, and Yellowjacket's bassist Jimmy Haslip--assisted ably by Otmaro Ruiz on keyboards and Marc Russo on sax. This disc contains 4 tracks from the studio-recorded version of Jing Chi (Going Nowhere, The Hong Kong Incident, Stan Key, and Crazy House), and 4 new tracks (That Road, What Goes Around, Cold Irons Bound, and Blues MD). Overall the cd has a little more bluesy and not quite as ""hard"" a feel to it as the studio version. As you'd expect with such a cast of characters, this is great stuff."
4,Not for everyone,"If you are looking for hummable tunes, this is the wrong disc for you. If on the other hand you are looking for four musicians improvising at the top of their game in a ""without a net"" setting this (and any Jing Chi CD for that matter) is a great thing to have.Is there a better guitarist than Robben Ford? Better drummer than Vinnie? Better bass player than Jimmy Haslip? I would say no, maybe some just AS GOOD or different. I have found myself always perking up when Jing Chi tune pops up on my random play."
2,needs to be updated,"Although good, It does not have documentation on Access Point 1200 and new authentication mechanisms such as PEAP etc. Otherwise has some good details, in additon to documentation that can also be found on Cisco website. Recommend not to buy until new edition comes out and it gets updated."
1,Badly Organized and Written,"Though this book contains some provocative thoughts about bipolar depression, it is poorly organized and badly written -- as if no editor had ever seen it. Though many cases are mentioned, none are discussed in depth or truly ""come alive."" At least one antidepressant is misspelled. Though a small point, it makes me suspect there are more important errors I'm not knowledgable enough to detect. Skip this one."
5,TRULY THE GREATEST,"This 29 song cd featuring one of the greatest voices of our lifetime, the late, great, Johnny Maestro, is surely a must have for all fans of Johnny and the Crests. This is a truly great compilation."
2,"Wonderful ballet, terrible video quality","The Sleeping Beauty is one of the most timeless classics of ballet there is, and the Royal Ballet does it justice with this lavish production. Having seen it on DvD before, however, I must count off several stars for the terrible video quality of this download. The resolution is ridiculously low for something that was purchased; much less than the DvD would have been. In addition, the bottom of the screen has been cut off, removing the most important aspect of the ballet--the dancing! I don't know whether this is a problem with all downloads, or just mine, but I must say, I'm very disappointed with my first experience with Amazon's Video on Demand."
1,New creation bah humbug,I don't want a new creation. I want the one with Monica Mason as Carabous. That production was shown on PBS many years ago and my tape is wearing out. I need a copy on DVD. If they release that version I'll buy it in a heartbeat. NOBODY does Carabous like Monica Mason. The rest of that production is just as good as anything done currently if not better than the new stuff.
4,ballet performance,Filmed like you are attending the performance with views of the orchestra and the stage. Totally lavish!
5,A Masterpiece,This is an amazing ballet that is performed beautifully. The costumes are awesome and the choreography is superb. I enjoyed watching this very much.
2,A Mediocre Beauty,"This is not a production for the ages but for the Royal Ballet, perhaps. Instead, check out the two best Sleeping Beauties--the 2006 Paris Opera Ballet DVD and the 2001 Kirov Ballet DVD (with Larissa Lezhnina as Aurora). The dancing and production values of the French and Russian versions are superlative in all respects. The choreography of this English version is abridged, slow, dignified, not well executed and, well, boring, with several dancers plain embarrassing (eg, the Bluebird duet). To see what the Royal Ballet used to be capable of, check out the Evening with the Royal Ballet DVD, which features ACT III of Sleeping Beauty with Margot Fonteyn from 1962. At age 40, Dame Margot was an order of magnitude better than a twenty-something Cojocaru."
2,A book in need of a map.,"On the one hand, McKechnie's prose is often clear and engaging, sprinkled with a sense of humour. There are bits and pieces of valuable insights in the text. On the other hand, it seems evident from the introduction on that the book lacks a clear direction or purpose. Despite some useful comments, it is hard to know what to make out the total picture. I was never clear where McKechine had left, or where he was heading. The book has value, but I came away unsatisfied."
4,"a valuable critique, but not a book for beginners","Overall, this is an interesting book. Throughout the book, the author throwed out questions that are good for deeper thoughts. But this book is definitely not suitable for someone who does not know enough about that period to weigh the various sources of evidence."
3,"if Jesus was real, It's sure he was like in Mailer's book.","Great book, no matter if you're christian or not. It's amazing how Mailer reserch to write it. You'll not rediscover life, but you'll start thinking different."
2,Doesn't add enough to the Bible,"This book has some merit, but does not add enough to the portrayal of Jesus in the gospels to make it deserving of more than two stars. I liked Mailer's simple prose, which displays little of the show-offishness of The Fight, and the way in which he links the familiar events of the gospels, but otherwise I found the book slightly uninspirational. Jesus is portrayed as very human, and as grappling with the problem of how to handle his status of Son of God and the powers that go with it, but this is not a remarkable insight on the part of Mailer. I would think that anybody who has read the Bible with a sense of curiosity would have considered this as well."
2,A conservative re-telling of the Gospels,"When I saw that Norman Mailer had written a book about Jesus I expected a searching biography of the man. For some reason I didn't expect Mailer to closely follow the Gospels. But he did, and I was disappointed. I already read the Gospels, more than once. I'd like to read a book that leaves out all supernatural occurrences and just focuses on a human being who has been very influential. This isn't the book. Personally, I don't believe in the miracles reported in the Bible, and I was hoping for an incisive biography of a great man. The book I want on this subject hasn't been written yet, I guess."
4,Thought Provoking Christ Point-Of-View.,"The Gospel According to The Son, is a well written, thought provoking book written from Christ's point-of-view. If Jesus Christ had written an auto-biography this would be it. It gives you a feeling of insight to what it must have been like for Christ to be ""God with Us"". The stuggle of being both Man & God is beutifully told in this book. If it isn't now this book should be considered a classic work of christian writting."
1,Why'd he bother?,"It is hard to find any compelling reason for Mailer to have written this book. There is little that is imaginative or new in this telling of the Jesus myth. Reading this, one would believe that scholars have discovered nothing about the life of Jesus since the gospels were written. Mailer's Jesus does nothing more than parrot the words put in his mouth by the gospel writers. Why not create a Jesus that would have been a product of his times, not one who is 20th century creation? Such a creation would have been worthy of Mailer's considerable talent. This ""Gospel"" can safely be ignored."
3,Enlightneing,"Mailer demonstrates how a[n] historical story loses a great deal while being transmitted by word of mouth from one generation to another. The New Testement is not the Greatest Story Ever Told, it is rather an askewed view of history. Mailer's book may not be a Gospel, it is, however, enlightning and can prove important to those who do not understand that the people who wrote the New Testement are indeed not the Desciples, but rather writers many years later, writers with their own vested interests."
3,Not as good as it could have been.,"Norman Mailer had the opportunity to advance some very bold,very interesting ideas regarding both the life and mission of Jesus ofNazareth. But it was not bold.And it was not that interesting.I would recommend the book to anyone interested, but would warn them also: no new ground is covered here."
2,No knock-out punch for the man who would be Hemmingway.,"Mailer falls short; but thank heaven the book is far shorter than his dismal ""Harlot's Ghost"". The author's ego -- battling ""The Old Man & The Sea"" for short novel, and ""Last Temptation"" for literary significance (both Nobel efforts) -- work's at humility in the first person and in doing so fails as a writer. The writing is as weak as any in terms of basic expository rules; at times it is smug, which is 180-degrees from humble.No American author has neglected his responsibility to literature more than Mailer. Fictionalized Journalism does not a Nobel Prize earn. The fiction here is totally lacking; as are active verbs, visual descriptions, writing as showing rather than telling. It's as though Mailer read the New Testament and then summarized it to a cronie over a few drinks at the bar, wet-minded enough to use the first person.A Passionist's prayers at the fourteen stations would be more revealing and uplifting and honest."
2,"Interesting, But Uneven","Mailer was looking for a miracle, but he will have to settlewith some broken bread and fish. The autobiography of Christ excellsin describing Satan's temptations and Judas, but boggs down in an irritating attempt to find Christ's dialect. While the introduction mocks the traditional gospels, Mailer too closely follows Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. The story spends too much time down by the Sea of Gallilee, then rushes at the end. God help us!"
2,Trite waste of time from Mailer who coud do better.,"Although this book was a great opportunity to add something tothe literature on the new paths of Christianity, it was a greatdisappointment instead. Although an occasional insight shows through, it is by and large, a superficial rehashing of the story of the New Testament with a few speculated thoughts of Jesus thrown in parenthetically. No surprises, no great controversies, no substance! Mailer has done so well in the past; I only wish this book did not have to be in his list of creations."
2,Dull,"I just finished this book. The reading was easy enough and I kept with it because I was hoping it would get better. The one word I have for the book, however, is *dull*.When I first read the cover for this book, I thought, ""Well, this should give a new slant to the gospel, a shift in perspective to the story of Jesus."" I was sorely disappointed.Mailer seems to have simply pulled out much of the sayings from the traditional gospels and changed up some of their chronology and shifted the narration into first person. Otherwise, not much is different. His Jesus seems as distant from his own story as any of the New Testament writers who recounted what had been passed down to them.There seems very little passion in this protagonist. Ironic isn't it? Mailer's Messiah does not have the charisma to gather the following of crowds, much less interested readers."
1,Jesus Rolling over on His Cross,"Argh! What a boring turkey of a novel this was! Mailer and Updike like to snub their noses and proclaim from their mighty recliners that THEY know literature. And if so, they can have it! I read this on a recomendation from a friend, well, and ex-friend. I'm sure he's coffee house hopping as I write this. Don't be fooled by pretentious blather... this isn't literature, just a vain attempt at it. I should have listend to Tom Wolfe when he said this book ""sunk without a bubble!"""
2,fundamentally mistaken,"In many ways this reminds me of Marion Bradley's Mists of Avalon: beautifully and persuadingly written and so completely believable if you enter the world of the author's imagination of how the story really is - but I believe both to be basically false. Mr Mailer seems to have little understanding of ""true"" spiritual experiences or of Biblical symbolism, or of what Jesus was really all about. But rather than keep on criticizing and putting people off of my comments, I would merely recommend they read the Reverend Sun Myung Moon's explanations of Jesus' life and examine how Rev Moom is seeking to fulfill Jesus' mission in our time."
3,There are much better things to read,"Surprisingly, Mailer adds to an already long list of conventional Christian novelizations (inflations) of the gospels, all of which are unnecessary if you've read the originals by the first-century authors. For something different, get your hands on the Nag Hamadi Library and read the gospels of Thomas, Phillip, and Mary. And the apocryphal gospels are a hoot; especially the nativity gospels of James and psuedo-Thomas (where a midwife learns the hard way to keep her hands away from Mary's private parts). The Jesus novels by D.H. Lawrence, Robert Graves, Nikos Kazantzakis, and Gore Vidal are all more imaginative, daring, intelligent, and illuminating than Mailer's. For good non-fiction reads, try E.P. Sanders, John Dominic Crossan, and Geza Vermes."
2,A Very Mixed Bag,"I really wonder if Mailer only wrote this after a bet, a dare, or a few beers, or all three. It's a sometimes adequate....at times very insightful and moving....rewrite of a Gospel. But, gees, Norm, this is a damn serious subject about a very complex guy.... couldn'ya have tried just a little bit harder? The characters (especially Jesus) are flat and dull. The overall story is dead boring. Where Mailer has a flash of insight, the dialogue and monologues are good....where he doesn't, he simply quotes the Gospels literally....those parts are intensely irritating. Come on, Norm. Next time you want to do a serious work, stay away from your mates and stay off the piss. And do a bit more thinking and research."
2,Dispassionate,"Sure Mailer took on the daunting task of telling Jesus's story through HIS eyes, but this does not necessarily bring the psyche of the Son of Man into focus. Jesus's actions and thoughts seem routine and often mundane. I wanted to feel the inner struggle that must have accompanied a man with the weight of the world on his shoulders. Reading Kazantzakis (The Last Temptation of Christ) proved ten times more fulfilling in this regard."
3,A missed opportunity,"I had expected better from Norman Mailer. There's nothing new in simply regurgitating the New Testament as seen through the undeniably creative eyes of Mr. Mailer. Where's the challenge? I don't want to be comforted, I want to be taken BEYOND myself. There's none of the bite and insight of ""The Autobiography of Jesus of Nazareth and the Missing Years"", none of the passion of Nikos Kazantzakis' ""The Last temptation"" and none of the ethereal beauty of D. H. Lawrence's ""The man who died"". For a lesser writer than Mr. Mailer, this would have been a creditable achievement. Sorry Mr. mailer, I guess I get to keep the cigar?"
2,Same Old Stuff,"There is little which is new or interesting in this book. Mailer has attempted to write a autobiography of Jesus of Nazareth. Ultimately, he write just another version of those 19th Century lives of Jesus in the first person. If you want to read a really good, modern life of Jesus, by suggestion is the Last Temptation of Christ."
2,Rather disappointing: adds nothing new to the tale,"While an enjoyable read, this story adds very little to theknown tale of Jesus. Neither his divinity nor his humanity isexplained beyond what we already know, except in the most obvious manner (Early on, Jesus questions his divinity - Gee! What an insight!).It seems Mailer, oddly enough, tries to avoid controversy and gives us a nicely told, but ultimately redundant story. The big question for me was, ""Why did he bother?"""
2,a disappointment,Norman Mailer offers neither incite nor a controversy in this blended tale of the four canonical Gospels as told from the view point of their central character. Many texts from the historical Jesus studies and the complete Gospels offers a more fascinating tale. Mailer maintains both divine birth and resurrection. His commentary on Judas was interesting. Unfortunately the book had the rapidity of Mark and none of the capable depth of Mailer
3,It was so-so,"Normally, I like books about this subject. So naturally, I picked up a copy of ""The Gospel According to the Son"". I'm not saying it was absolutely awful, but it wasn't exactly a gripping page-turner either. It was straight out of the Gospels in the Bible. It was interesting, however, to hear Christ narrate His own life. Still, I would skip this one if you're looking for something you want to read over and over."
3,Wait for paperback or get it from the library,"Reading A Winter Haunting after reading Summer of Night is like reading Endymion after Hyperion. You know that you should be grateful because it's a lot better than other works in the genre, but all you feel is disappointment because you know Simmons is capable of so much more.I was scared to stop reading Summer of Night the first time I read it, scared to go to sleep before I got to the end and the resolution I hoped was coming. With A Winter Haunting, I instead found myself pondering the number of pages left to read and wondering if there was time for anything astonishing to happen.I don't regret reading this but I certainly regret buying it, especially in hardcover."
3,disappointing but still good,"This was a pretty decent book but not quite what you'd expect if you've read Summer of Night. This was more like a suspense novel where Summer of Night was a true horror novel. Don't get me wrong i think Dan Simmons does suspense very well, but i think that if you're coming into this thinking its going to be like the first book, forget it. The ideas were good and it was interesting to see what had happened to the characters, it seemed as if whatever it was, death or evil caught up with just about all of them somehow. Also the interludes about Clare were unnecessary. it was just another way of trying to convince you that yes, maybe Dale is crazy and that none of the previous events happened,but it was not needed. I also thought that Duane being a part of the story was ridiculous. There was potential for a great story here but it was merely only a good story."
2,Disappointing...,"If you buy this book in order to ""visit"" some of the original characters in Summer of Night, you will be extremely disappointed. Most of the original characters are not involved in this sequel and, even worse, some of the characters I was most fond of are developed in undesirable and disturbing ways.This book was also disappointing as a stand-alone story since the plot is somewhat confused and nothing is really resolved for the main character. Also, the confusing changes and merging of point(s) of view are very confusing and distracting.I am a big fan of Dan Simmons and have read all of his published stories, so I can say with some authority that this is not one of his most notable efforts"
2,He's No Stephen King,"Being not a Simmons afficionado I can't fairly say that he is a bad writer; but if ""A Winter Haunting"" is any example of his writing, I must say that I won't be reading any more of his work. I thought ""A Winter Haunting"" lacked substance, and feeling. The main character goes back to a spooky abandoned farmhouse where his best friend, the brilliant Duane, was killed in a nasty farming accident. And this is all the pretense Simmons gives you. He messes around with some mysterious hounds, takes a lot of walks (Lord have mercy, does this character walk!), and finds himself attracted to a lesbian; gets his tires slashed, not once, but twice by a group of ""belligerent youths"", aka skinheads. All in all, I give this novel two thumbs down."
1,Total Disappointment,"I absolutely loved Summer of Night and was eagerly waiting the sequel. Upon reading it I was very disappointed. It seems that Dan Simmons is an author who is losing his touch. In no way was this how I thought the main character of Summer of Night would turn out. The story has poor pacing and a pretty stupid plot. Simmons seems to want us to come away with the opinion that the events in Summer of Night were subjective and perhaps a hallucination. If you want a better sequel look towards Children of the Night or Fires of Eden, both of which have characters from Summer of Night in them. Avoid this book unless you are a diehard Simmons fan."
3,Are sequels a good idea?,"Although this is a very readable book, for Dan Simmons fans it falls short of the entertainment level of ""Summer of Night"". For those of us who hated reading of Duane's demise, there's hope of something ""beyond"" death, but the book seems to reach for something just beyond its grasp."
4,a gripping tale,"""A Haunted Winter"" will grip you from the first page till the last. For members of the baby boom generation, especially for those from the midwest, the novel will evoke childhood memories of another, sunnier time. When Montana college professor Dale's life turns to shambles, and he lives through a failed suicide attempt, he decides to make a kind of pilgrimage back to the small Illinois town where he grew up, to the farm house of his friend, the astonishingly precocious Duane. Duane's early and mysterious death forty years ago once more haunts Dale as he struggles to write a novel and to piece his own life back together.Despite some sex scenes and some violent encounters which, though well written, seem obligatory for the genre, Dan Simmons has produced an original and outstanding thriller."
2,Blah,"Summer of Night (this is the sequel) is one of my favorite horror novels. Its very similar to Stephen Kings It and if you're a fan of It I highly recommend you check Summer of Night out. This followup though couldn't be more different. Its about one of the kids from Summer of Night as a grownup. He comes home and stays at this farm haunted by one of the other kids from Summer.. who died in that novel. Where as Summer... was full of action and interaction between the kids and Lovecraft like monsters, this is just the sole character hanging around. Its slow and not very scary. take a pass and try Boys Life by McCammon instead."
2,Can someone explain the end to me?,"First, I didn't realize this was a sequel. Second, Drood and The Terror were good books. Third, this book was not good.Can someone explain the ending to me? I became totally lost as to who the narrator was and what really happened throughout the story. Seriously, if someone could just comment (with a spoiler alert) and break this down for me I'd really appreciate it. Thank you."
2,Simmons must be a Peter Straub fan too,"This book is a paint-by-numbers ripoff of Peter Straub's If You Could See Me Now. If you've read Straub's book, don't waste your time on this twice-told tale."
1,What?!,"""What?!"" is what I exclaimed when I finished this book. Why is it in the ""Horror"" section? I can't believe this book was written by the same author as ""The Terror"" (loved ""Terror""). There is NOTHING even remotely scary, disturbing, or ""horrifying"" about this book. I gave it a shot because there was a line from Stephen King (to me is THE KING of not just horror, but storytelling) in the reviews saying ""I am in awe of Simmons)...How kind of King to say, but I find that is ""not all together true""...Writing and imagery that makes your eyes widen, and as Mary Shelly said to cause the reader to dread to look around, to cause dread, now THAT is HORROR story telling. Not dogs with human teeth; that would make every Hanna Barbara cartoon an animated horror flick. Winter Haunting (which doesnt even take place in the winter....) is interesting but NOT a horror."
1,SO not scary .....,"I used to love reading Simmons - but no more. It's seems as if he goes to the library, reads up on a subject, then sprinkles the findings of his research into his latest novel - whether it has anything to do with the story or not. In this case: not. There's a blurb on the back cover from the St. Louis Post-Dispatch which says, ""One of the scariest and most unnerving ghost stories to come along in quite some time."" Wow - I wonder what that guy was smoking. The tip off should have been the blurb by Stephen King on the cover which says, ""I am in awe of Dan Simmons"", which doesn't refer to this book or ANY book. He's probably in awe that Simmons can get away with publishing this crap."
2,Awful sequel,"Very disappointing sequel to SUMMER OF NIGHT. If you enjoyed SUMMER OF NIGHT, I recommend staying clear of A WINTER HAUNTING, as it effectively ruins the first book, and most of its characters."
3,Good but not Summer of Night.,"After reading Summer of Night, a far superior story, I was glad to see a sequel. This book was interersting, and the ending made it worth sticking with - in fact the last chapter is probably the best part - actually the last two or three pages are. Often relentlessly deperssing, and the back story of Dale's young girlfriend Clare is a distraction and takes up far too much of the novel, becoming filler. At one point Simmon's character even muses on whether this is a badly written story or reality. So it may have been a deliberate experiment or joke. Whatever the case, worth reading, but not a classic like Summer of Night. There is also no resolution of Dale's experience in the previous novel, although that is hinted at by his ""alter ego"" at the end. I'll leave it for you to find out who that is."
3,"Good book, but sub-par for Dan","First off, Dan Simmons is one of my five favorite authors. I have every single one if his books in hardback and have read most of them multiple times. That being said, this was a good book, better than average even, but not up to Dan's usual extremely high standards. Yes, it was a ghost story in that it had ghosts in it, but I was never creeped out or scared at all. It was just a little too tame for me to call it a ghost story. It was more of a slightly unnerving psychological analysis. I read it straight through, it was enjoyable and kept a good pace and I was never bored and I do reccommend it, but if I was ranking all of Dan's books, this would be very close to the bottom."
2,"Say it isn't so, Dan!","Others here have adequately filled you in on enough of the plot of A Winter Haunting, so I won't rehash what's already been written. What I will say is this: if you are a true Summer of Night fan, if you've read it more than once and have enjoyed the other exploits of its characters as adults (Fires of Eden, for example)you may be sorely disappointed in this book, as I am. SPOILER .....After all is said and done, this ""update"" on Dale leaves the reader with the sad possibility that none of the true horror elements of ""Summer"" ever happened, and that this it (Summer) was Dale's memoir which has been tweaked by the ghost of Duane to spin it into a horror tale.Dan, oh Dan, say it isn't so!!"
2,hard to stay with,"I had a really hard time staying with this story.Some parts were good than it would very quickly get boring and drawn out,I found myself skipping over many pages.It is not a story that would stay with me,it just didn`t keep my interest.Not even half as good as the prequel."
3,Lukewarm is the term I would use...,"I loved Summer of Night - it is rare to find a book so well written and believable on ""supernatural"" subjects that it gives you nightmares as this one did for me. Needless to say, I was expecting or at the very least, hoping for, more of the same with A Winter Haunting. Seeing what became of the kids was one thing and continuing the Egyptian theme was a good tie-in; but having read and re-read Summer of Night, there are several things that don't add up in the sequel. Plus, it just wasn't as interesting. Capable writing, but certainly not inspired or groundbreaking."
3,Not as good as the prequel,"This book left me with a lot of unanswered questions and loads of supension of disbelief. This is a sequel to Summer of Night, set about 40 years later with one of the main charcters from the first book. It was an okay read, but Summer of Night was a much more gripping book than this one was to me. I cared more about the charcters in the prequel than the charcters in this one."
5,Beats the Summer of Night,"I loved this book, the final twist made it great. The Summer the kids faced the darkness at the old school left its mark. Dale is quite beleivable as a college prof that is all too human, and has faltered. He goes back to his roots and the location of his damage, to explore his flaw. Some of the ghosts from that summer are still there."
4,Good Suspense!,"This is the first book I have read by Dan Simmons, and he has a way of making you scared! The characters in this book were mostly believeable, there were a few parts I found hard to relate with. The story plot line was very well written, however."
5,"spooky, emjoyable read","I bagan reading this novel and finished it in 2 days. One of the creepiest books I've read since ""The Shining"" and ""Salem's Lot"". A spooky, fun read........try it even if you're not a horror fan. Simmons is right up there with Koontz and King."
1,Don't waste your money or time,"This is by far the worst book that I have read in a long time. I bought it because I was going on a long plane trip and felt like a good, scary story would hit the spot. Well good turned out to be awful, and as for scary, a cockroach is scarier than this book. If you were thinking of buying this book, don't."
2,What happened here?,"i recently began reading dan simmons' novels, and the two i started with are summer of night and winter haunting. after finishing summer of night, i was thrilled to find that winter haunting contained some of the same characters. i was expecting the same feeling of terror while i read it. the book was entertaining but definitely not as great as its predecessor. in fact, i was rather disappointed at the fact that the author could not keep continuity between the 2 books. i know they were written 10 years apart, but for goodness sake, some of the differences were really noticable. and i couldn't help but wonder if the intent was to totally negate summer of night. such a shame because it's such a wonderful book."
4,Truly suspenseful,"This book was a total page turner! I was actually afraid at some points. That hasn't happened since I read the ""The Shining"" back in the dark ages. My favorite thing about Simmon's writing is his ability to create characters with depth, people that are realistic and three-dimensional. His stories are always very tight and believable rather than fantastical, which is hard to pull off when you're talking about ghosts and the supernatural. Gotta respect that."
2,Don't bother,"For Dan Simmon's, this is a very short novel. Why he would completely waste so many pages of it on the boring and trivial is beyond me. It starts out in a psychiatrists office where the distraught protagonist very calmly and drying describes what should be a horific dream yet it comes off about as scary as bad wallpaper. I must add that it is the most unrealistic therapy sesson I have ever read. Then novel bumbles along in dreary boringness.Does it get better. Technically, yes but not by much. If you haven't read Summer of Night, read that instead! If you have already read Summer of Night, do not touch this book!"
5,An absolute must read for paranormal fanatics!,"To be honest, I first bought this book because of its cover. I was in the mood for a good scary read and the old house covered in snow sitting on the front cover caught my attention and reminded me of home in Maine. This book has one of the scariest scenes that I have ever read and for those of you who have read this, you'll remember him cutting the plastic to gain acces to the second floor. If you love ghost stories or the adrenaline rush from being frightened then this is a MUST HAVE for your library!"
1,One huge disappointment,"Anyone who has read Summer of Night will no doubt expect a superb follow-up with its semi-sequel, A Winter Haunting. However, this is not the case. Where the former was truly frightening and a page-turner, it was a struggle to read more than the first 20 pages of the latter. I found A Winter Haunting to be dull and uneventful, more a story about Dale's life and the problems of a small town than about anything scary. For the most part, a big disappointment!"
2,Just Disappointed,"I was excited to read this novel before I even read Summer of Night...but now I just disappointed that I was excited to read it. It seems to me that Mr. Simmons just figured, ""Hey, Summer of Night was a good book...eh... I'm low on cash, so I'll slop up this meaning-less sequel"". I was deeply angered by a few things that I can't go into because it would spoil the book for future readers, but should have been included for faithful readers of Summer of Night.Also, in no way was the Dale in Winters Haunting the same Dale as in Summer of Night. I know the character obviously aged and had a few problems in life, but let's get real here.It hurts me to type this about a series and cast of characters I really feel for, but this book should not have been written, it's just a pile of crap that fails to entertain let alone make any sense."
1,Dreadful...,"If it was possible to rate this album with zero stars, I would. Horrible! I actually threw it in the trash."
1,They weren't wrong with that sub-title.,"I purchased this book expecting a witty retort against the books it parodies. Instead, it appears to be a collection of every remotely relevant ""email forward"" that ever existed. These forwards are something I dislike receiving in my inbox, let alone actually paying money for.In addition to that, there are a number of errors that undermine its entire point - in one spot, it tests the reader's ability to spell the word ""calendar"", (ignoring that both ""calender"" and ""calendar"" are real words), giving multiple-choice-style options. Unfortunately, none of the multiple choice options actually matches the answer given. Considering the sub-title of this book, perhaps this is some level of sincerity that I fail to appreciate.I made the unfortunate mistake of expecting a large amount of original content that had at least been proofread. Silly me."
4,A Parody ?,"The title of the book (and the authors name viz. A Parody) seems to indicate that it is a spoof on the hugely-popular recent book with a similar name ""Eats, Shoots and Leaves"" (By Lynn Truss).The book starts off by saying that it is ok to make grammatical mistakes (something which the Lynn Truss book considers as a blasphemy) but the book is not about bad english or its usage.I found the book to be about the magic of the English Language. How different things can mean different things in different contexts. The book talks about cliches, maxims, abbreviations, political gaffes, spoonersims. You name it. Like I said, through examples of bad english and bad grammer, the author (is his name actually A. Parody?) shows us the appeal of the English language.Not to be missed!"
5,Great!,"Very high quality light fixture. Easy to put together. Exceeded our expectations, which were high. There is nothing cheap about this lamp. Could easily be a heirloom furniture item."
4,Patricia Finney's first book a brilliantly realistic fantasy,"The Shadow of Gulls is Patricia Finney's first book, written while she was still a teenager. As such it is an amazing achievement. She has managed to blend celtic mythology and with realistic characters to produce a book superior to most in its genre. The plot centers arround Lugh Mac Romain, a harper and warrior in 1st century Ireland. Lugh is unwittingly made King of Connaught but escapes the inevitable ritual death by being lamed in battle after fleeing Connaught. However he earns the implacable hatred of Maeve Queen of Connaught and her persuit of him drives the plot of this book and its sequel ( Crow Goddess). Only bettered by its sequel, together they make a superb read."
3,"Cushions recoil, but kind of awkward fit.","Used this bench shooting a Mosin and a Remington 700, sucked up all the recoil, shoulder felt fine after a couple hundred rounds one day.Tried it trap shooting and it was hard to mount the gun smoothly. So, I would say it has limited applications.Good price though."
2,Every Picture tells a story...,I agree without pictures it is very hard to visualize exactly how do to do the lessons that are presented. Someone should revise it an do it justice by adding pictures to it to make it more understandable.
5,Basics,"As a long time practicioner of San Soo myself, it was good to see one of the old time Masters take the time to document the lessons as taught by Grand Master Woo. Master Ron Gatewood was one of the students who was there from almost the beginning of the school and has the most thorough documentation of what Master Woo taught and said. It is fortunate that he is willing to share some of the knowledge passed on by Grand Master Woo."
5,Defend yourself basics,"I recieved exactly what I ordered and in a timely manner. I was very happy with this purchase. Very informative about the martial art of San Soo. Remember, that when you're attacked, they don't care if they hurt you."
3,An okay book.,While this book does capture the essence of the san soo basic 45 there are several flaws in it. First off Mr. Gatewood's insulting of past and current San Soo practitioners belittles the art and himself. I lost alot of respect for him when I read the material. His use of someone who is clearly not a San Soo practitioner in the picture expamples is also of bad character. And last I would say that upon confering with several other practitioners that some of his interpretations of the basic 45 are a little off. To the plus column I really enjoyed his end notes on the reasoning behind each lesson. I thought that added alot of value to the piece.
2,Whats with the wet dog smell???,Just purchased this product less than 2 weeks ago and out of know where it starts emitting a powerful wet dog odor. I found other people with the same exact issue on a different units but it seems to be the fan motor that blows out the air after its been filtered. Very disappointed because I bought this filter based on all the great reviews. The smell is so bad I cannot use this filter. I will be contacting Honeywell to see if there is a recall or its a known issue and hopefully either getting a replacement or a refund. This is the link to the other customers with the same issue. [...]
3,Honeywell air purifier,"I have owned one of these units for five plus years. It does a good job at cleaning the air. And it is worth the money. The bad side is: Where I am at I have to order the filters and they are not inexpensive. It is difficult to clean the slots the air comes in at. And with the medium speed the noise is noticeable, on high it is too noisy."
2,Too loud!!,"I set this up and turned it on and my husband immediately said it had to go back. While I really wanted an air purifier for my baby's room, I had to agree. The one I received was just too loud, even at its lowest setting. The noise bothered us even through 2 doors and from 50 feet away. I have a now discontinued Honeywell 17450 that I really like, is quite effective and is much quieter. This unit (17000N) might clean the air, but we couldn't stand to be anywhere near it to find out."
1,QuietCare True HEPA Air Purifier,"I had purchased one of these units for my kids some years ago and it worked great. SO I ordered another unit recently.The new unit has a terrible noxious smell coming from the guts of the unit when turned on - seems like the plastic in the HEPA filter or motor oil in the electric motor. After running it a few days with no change I returned this unit and recieved a new one with the same problem. I also talked to the manufacturer, KAZ, since it seemed like they got a bad batch of filters. They were willing to provide a new unit if I paid for the shipping. The status of this unit is still unresolved.I would not recomend this unit to anyone unless you can tolerate the smell of noxious organic materials - such organic vapors could even be carcinogenic."
5,Does the job,We can tell the difference in the air after it's run for a couple of hours. We use it in a bedroom that doesn't get good air circulation through the house filter. On high it has the same noise level as a hotel air unit. We let it run during the day and turn it off at night.
3,Quiet???? Confused!,"Not quiet. Tolerable on low. You CAN watch TV in a room with it on low, but it doesn't function at it's fullest capacity on low. It does seem to be effective. I've had it a month and have already had to clean the pre-filter so it's doing something. For now, I run it on low during the day and on high at night when the room is unoccupied. I'm not in love with this purifier, though. I'm much happier with my Germ Guardian and will be buying 2 more of those. [...]"
5,EXCELLENT,"It was so hard to choose an air purifier based on product reviews, b/c they vary so much. I'm so glad I chose this one. People say it's noisy. We use humidifiers in the winter, and the noise it alot like that. To tell the truth, it's a good white noise. This was excellent for dissipating paint fumes and sawdust. They've been practically running nonstop for almost a month and still going strong. They're easy to carry from room to room. Carbon filters are cheap to replace and hepa can be vaccummed. I'm happy with this purchase."
2,ok when it worked,"Bought it used it worked fine.Then a year later, it died, just stopped working period.Surely it is meant to last longer?Looks like it knew when the warranty would run out because it almost died right after the year was up!"
2,Out of balance fan,"Liked the ease of changing filters and the button layout, but when turned on the plastic ""squirrel cage"" fan was out of balance and produced an annoying sound. Even if the unit came with the fan perfectly balanced, from the quality of the fan, it won't stay like that more than a year. If it was not sitting in the bedroom, it wouldn't be so bad, it is a good price for a hepa filter, but it doesn't move much more air than the $40 unit I had before, it is a top rated one from here as well (which also gave me the same trouble after 6 months of use - fan became out of balanced)Why such bright blue lights on these units? *sigh* I guess I will have to fork out >$200 for a better unit."
1,Broke in two months!,"Bought this unit and didn't even run it 24/7. Came home one day and the purifiers motor had burned out. Only had it for a couple of months. Very poorly made, save you money and look elsewhere."
1,Poor Quality Product,I've used Honeywell filters for many years and I've seen a gradual reduction in quality over the years. The motor on this unit just stopped after 4 months of use and was thrown away. It's primary purpose seems to be plastic recycling!
5,Fantastic Air Purifier,"I've had this air purifier for almost a year now. I'm a college student, and there is a ton of disgusting black dust in the apartment dorm that I'm living in. This cleaner does an amazing job picking up great amounts of dust, hair, and other particles which you can see on the black pre-filter. While it is loud on the ""high"" setting, it works just fine on the ""low"" setting. A good idea is to put it on ""high"" when you are out of the room, and when you come back, set it on ""low"".For almost a year of using it without ever shutting it off, I've never had a problem with it. The air smells clean and the filter does its job. What more could you ask for? If you're looking for an air filter for a bedroom or office, this is the perfect choice."
5,Video Review,"I think the unit works really well. Had it on the high setting today while watching TV and did not find the unit distracting. It just sounds like a fan. If you are interested, here is a video showcasing the volume of the unit. [...]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfN8YCF93as"
5,I am very pleased with the item - it could not be better.,I am pleased with it and would recommend it to anyone. I have it in my bedroom and it helps me a great deal.
1,not 17000-N,"i ordered this amazon product last weekHoneywell Long-Life Pure HEPA QuietCare Air Purifier, 17000Nwhich has ""17000N"" in the name field, and ""Ships from and sold by Amazon.com."" What i received was 17000-S, not 17000-N. I searched prior reviews and found one reviewer saying 17000-S does not have permanent HEPA filter...the box for my unit (17000-S) says the HEPA filter needs to be replaced every 3-5 years.I'm giving it one star rating because i am unhappy that Amazon mis-lables the product. I wonder why it is not labled correctly."
1,Worked great.... for a week,"You would think that a product this expensive would come with some quality. Purchased one, it is louder than our other 3 filters. Before it died on me, it did work well. 1 week after purchase the motor siezed."
1,Dead Fish Smell,"I purchased this unit from Home Depot. I ran it on high for two days and on the third day I went into my bedroom and it reeked of old fish/burning rubber. It was the worst smell I have ever encountered. I brought it back to the store where the cashier could still smell the stench on the machine itself. She damaged it out and even wrote ""stinks like fish"" on the label. I will not be replacing it with another Honeywell product."
2,Terrible manufacturing,"I have returned two of these 17000 units due to fan problems and returned one of the 17005 units for the same reason. This last replacement was by far the worst with syrofoam bits shooting from the vent and a noise that sounds like a lawnmower. Seriously? They can't make these air purifiers better than this?? My first 17000 is still working fine so far, and I have a 18155, which is working fine. I will give one more try to Honeywell with the purchase of a second 18155, but if it doesn't work as well as the first one, I'm done with their brand."
5,Built Tough and Works Hard,"Forget all those *Ion Stick* air cleaners. This is the real deal. Moves a lot of air, and gets the room clean and dust free in just an hour or two. The filters are easy to change. The prefilter goes for about 7 bucks each and the main HEPA for about 20, but the latter only has to be changed every couple of years. About as noisy as a fan."
3,Nice design but bad quality control.,"I like the design. It's not too big and not heavy, and the handle makes it easy to move. I bought 3. One went bad after a week. I got a replacement. The replacement was defective out of the box. Makes me question the build quality."
2,Don't bother.,"I bought this machine and was very disappointed. It is loud, bulky and does not do a good job filtering the air. I would recommend getting a really good vacuum (we have the yellow Dyson and it does a wonderful job) and just going over your floors and surfaces everyday if you want to cut down on dust and pet hair."
2,Probably not a good idea for persons w/respiratory illness,"To quote:""It turns O2 into O3 (ozone) which can irritate the lungs.""Those of you who are already not getting enough oxygen will understand why reducing the amount of available O2 in the air could be a REALLY bad idea....Hope this helps...."
5,Excellent Experience,"I purchased a Honeywell 17000 Air Purifier from a huge retail home products store for my son's dorm room. The box had been sealed but when I opened it the item had obviously been used and returned since the filter was soiled. I ordered on line and purchased the same item for less money and free shipping. The box was in pristine condition and clearly never opened. The air purifier inside was sealed in plastic for cleanliness. I was extraordinarily pleased with this purchase and the item works perfectly for removing dust, odors and air-borne viruses from the dorm room."
2,Did the Job for a while... then kaput,"I had, note HAD, two (2) of these Honeywell units, and overall, they were on the noisy side when compared to the Hunter Quietflo, but they did the job, BUT just FOR a few years, then both of motors burnt out... the first unit warned me with a squealing noise for about a week and then just froze up... the second one, well, it was the silent sufferer of the two, never complained but just stopped one evening within months of the first. If it would have be just one of the air purifiers, well, I would have though bad luck... but both? NOT. I had the motors checked out and both were DOA... my option was to send them back to Honeywell and have them replaced for almost price that I paid... the other was to buy another. That is what I did, but, not Honeywell (I bought the Hunter QuetFlo #30402). For the price of a Honeywell the motor should run for many years, not just a few. Conditionally recommended"
3,"Too loud for the bedroom, somehting was wrong...","First I purchased the Honeywell 50150, but it was way too loud for my bedroom. I moved it into the living room and purchased this one (Honeywell Long-Life Pure HEPA QuietCare Air Purifier, 17000) as I have 2 of an older version at work and the low setting is whisper quiet. Not so in the new version. I'd have to guess that the fan blade or motor was off unbalance or something because the spinning blade produced an uneven whirling sound. It also makes quiet a draft, cooling the room a few degrees. I returned it and am waiting to receive the Honeywell HFD-120-Q Tower Quiet Air Purifier. It did seem to work, but I prefer the design of the 50150 both aesthetically and functionally."
5,Works great,I bought one for my sister and liked it so much that I got one for myself. It is a lot quiter and a larger filter than my older honeywell.
1,bad smell after 4 days,"The first three days of using this air purifier in our bedroom, it worked great. The air was fresher, I felt less congested and life was good. Then, on the fourth day, the bedroom smelled like burnt rubber. The smell was coming out of the unit. It goes back tomorrow before we get affixiated or it catches fire. This unit was the 17000S model. I understand the 17000N model is of better quality, but I haven't been able to find any, so I guess I'll be looking at other brands. Too bad, Honeywell."
3,Strange chemical odor,"I believe the air cleaner is working, but it's hard to tell. It gives off a strange chemical odor and has for the several months I've been running it (continuously at first). I no longer use it because of this. I contacted Honeywell, and they suggested I run it outside for about an hour, which I did with no results. It seems like the pre-filter must have been coated with too many chemicals. I'm reluctant to go out and spend good money after bad and try a new pre-filter, but right now the purifier is just taking up room. Anyone else have this problem?"
4,Not a permanent HEPA filter,Description at time of this review says it has a permanent HEPA filter which can be vacuumed. It does not. Manual says it is a long life filter that will last up to five years and will need replaced.Other then the filter lie I like the design of the product. Works greate.
2,"Loud, flimsy, and dead in a week - Bad, Honeywell, bad.","VERY LOUD - THESE REVIEWS AREN'T LYING! I had a Honeywell like this 10 years ago - still going strong. Remarkable quiet and strong, so I'd thought I'd try a second for a smaller room. OUCH. Noisy. Bad, Honeywell, bad.The filter and the silly wrap-around carbon 'filter' (a fancy name for a plain black screen) don't fit around the fan, which is why this sucker ROARS. So, I compared the little one with the older (albeit bigger) one. No contest, the older Honeywell (same design and shape, BTW) caught more in its filter than the new one. Bad, Honeywell, bad.OK, maybe no big deal. Wrong. Quit working in a week. It started buzzing, grinding and then would not start. Dead. Back it goes - hopefully, no major grief. Bad, Honeywell, bad.Bad, Honeywell, bad."
4,Does the job,I live in an apartment above a smoker. My bedroom used to have smoke odors. It is sized 12 by 17. I used the Air Purifier on high setting for 30 mins and it clears the room. The remaining time I run it on low. There is noise akin to a fan on medium setting. It becomes unnoticeable after a while.
5,great purifier!,this purifier is great! does not give out a smell unlike the ionic purifiers. it was not as quiet as i thought it would be but i got use to it. its always running because i have allergies. and this purifier helps me a whole lot!
5,Really good,"I bought one of these and they are very good. I had bad allergies and getting one reduced my symptoms. The thing is a *bit* loud on medium setting, and loud on the high setting, but not too bad. If you run it on medium, it is not that loud. I highly recommend it."
1,Nasty chemical smell,"This filter gave off a nasty chemical odor. It seems to come from the rubber material around the HEPA filter and upset my allergies. I am sure that not all of them have this issue, but mine sure did! Quality control is not what it used to be I guess...And it was also way too loud! It was not at all quiet on Low, and on Medium I would have to jack up the volume of the TV. They chose to put the word ""quiet"" in the products name, it is not even close.Returning it to Amazon was easy, no issues. I have since purchased a Winix 5300 from Amazon and have been very happy with it. It has more advanced features then the Honeywell and is QUIET on low while still moving a lot of air!!! It is possible!Maybe if Honeywell decided to update their technology they could release a great product. This style of filter from Honeywell has seen very little in the way of improvements over the last 15 years."
5,fantastic!!!!,"LOL, there's nothing quiet about this thing but man o man i works wonders for my allergies! I just one day of having it on in my room i notice a drastic difference. I no longer have a stuffy nose and scratchy eyes when i wake up in the morning!!!! Thank God!!!! Worth every penny IMO"
5,Everything I hoped for,"I've had this product for about 3 years and am very pleased. The noise level is fine for me. We keep it on low and have no trouble listening to the TV. It also provides some nice white noise for sleeping.I change the carbon prefilter every 2 months and it is amazing how much dust is on it. I buy cheap replacement carbon filters at Lowes. The HEPA filter I changed once (after 2 years). These are pricey, but with the amount of dust this thing takes out of the air, I knew it was a good investment.Filters are easy to change, machine itself is easy to clean, and it does a great job."
2,Honeywell 17000 Pure HEPA QuietCare Air Purifier,"Please do not buy this unit if you smoke, or if you want to use it in a room where there is smoke. The HEPA filters will eventually absorb the smoke to a point where the unit will become unusable, as it will continuously blow out smoky air, regardless of where it is used. The HEPA filters will have to be replaced at a considerable expense. We are very disappointed in this feature flaw, as we purchased the unit solely for this purpose. THe HEPA filters cannot be cleaned. The product description talks about cleaning the air of smoke and while it certainly will do that, it does it at considerable expense and inconvenience."
2,"Worked great for six months, then wet dog smell","The smell is unbearable. I'm told it's the HEPA filter but that shouldn't matter.Works great, just stinks to high heaven. Will be happy to hear about a solution since it's otherwise good."
1,Noisy and poorly made,"This cleaner is noisy and shakes. It is also poorly and cheaply made, with some of the plastic seams not even bonded together, so it can be easily separated. In addition, it is supposed to come with small plastic pads to put on yourself to help with the cushion. Instead it came with them already put on, and put on unevenly so I can't even put them on myself to allow for my own floor or table. I'm returning it."
3,attractive design,"I used to have this model but wanted to get an air cleaner with more power and longevity. This model has an extremely attractive design and is quiet but has flaws such as:1) The filters don't last very long2) The carbon pad filter is inadequate for certain strong fumes(both HEPA and the carbon filter must be replaced after using it in an environment filled with fumes like glue, paint thinner, paint, nail polish remover)3) The plastic construction is bad because of offgasing.This unit may be good for a single room, but for larger places you need something stronger."
2,LOUD & EXPENSIVE,"I bought this filter for my mom's house because she has bad allergies and has a cat. It is VERY LOUD, so she can not leave it on during the night while she sleeps. Also, the HEPA filters that you need to change out every year cost almost as much as the unit $60-$90 and you also have to buy another filter that is not as expensive $20 but you have to change out every other month. The 1-bedroom condo still smells of Tiger the cat, even though he sadly passed away several months ago."
4,Wish I bought this years ago!!!!!!!,"What a great improvement in my air quality with this purifier! My bedroom has poor circulation so it's always been VERY dusty and stagnant. I often woke up with an irritated throat and nose and knew it was from the poor air quality. So I bought this purifier and within one day of running it I notice a HUGE difference in my air quality!! My room doesn't smell stuffy and dusty anymore, it smells fresh and clean! And best of all, I don't wake up with a sore throat! At first I thought this thing was LOUD but after one or two nights, I got used to it and now I can't sleep without the loud hum. I thought the little blue light was a tad bright too (but I'm just super sensitive about light when I sleep, it probably wouldn't bother the average person) so I covered it with a few layers of duct tape and perfect! And I love the long-life filter, I didn't want a purifier that needed new filters every couple months. SOoooo happy."
4,Allergies Gone,After being sick from mold in my house for over a year I got this. Not only do I wake up without coughing I sleep better and I am able to love all over my dog without having and allergic reaction now that her dander is not in the air. This air filter does a wonderful job on pet dander and mold. And really keeps the smoke smell out of my room when my roommates smoke. I replace the pre-carbon filter every 2 to 3 months at a cost of about $4 each. Worth every cent of breathability.
3,Just like the other reviews.,"Like the other reviews it does the job of filtering the air, I also bought the carbon filter to remove smells, works good.only issue is high noise on anything other than low speed, but low speed is addequate for most of time when I am in the room."
2,Entirely met my expectations - Until it died one year later.,"I have had this for one week now and it seems to be a quality product that does exactly what it claims to do. I am using one of these in the center of my 1000 sq. ft. house. Of course, that is beyond this products effective range by 5-6 times. No, it does not filter the whole house, but it is effective enough that I plan to purchase one or two additional larger units to add filtering capacity in different rooms.I recommend this product matched to room size. This units capacity is 168 sq. ft. It has a convenient handle and can be moved easily from room to room.It does make noise. However, there are 3 speeds if you need less noise. On a scale of 1-10 10 being loudest, I would rate the three speeds noise as 2 - 4 - 9.Edit: Died after eaxactly one year. CHANGED RATING DOWN TO 2."
5,Use it daily,My husband and son have allergies and we have pets in the house. We run it daily for the past year. I believe it has helped.
4,so far so good,i smoke - my son doesn't. he tells me this has made a big difference so i'm satisfied. on high it is noisy but for the benefits i'll live with the noise
3,Seems to work,"The Honeywell Long-Life Pure HEPA QuietCare Air Purifier, 17000 seems to work well. My husband and son have allergies so we have one in our bedroom and one in our son's bedroom. It is loud on high, but on low it is not bad to sleep with the sound. I am not sure if it really works, but I feel better having them. And husband and son seem to to breathe easier at night now that we got them."
4,Works great.,"This product is easy to use, filters well, and on the low speeds is quiet. On the high speed it is a great white noise generator."
2,"Very noisy, even on low speed","I like the size and ease of moving it about. HOWEVER, the thing is very noisy, even on low speed. I see no way to lubricate the motor anyone could sleep with all the noise this machine makes. The expense of buying a large box and shipping it back is the only reason I kept the machine. I must say that it does seem to do a fairly good job in cleaning the air. My advice is if you don't want a real noise-maker don't buy this one!!"
3,"Two order, one worked...","Ordered two of these for my home, and upon arrival one works perfectly while the other makes an awful grinding sound. I'm sure it's a bearing issue with the fan, and Amazon has provided a return label to refund. I'm going to keep the other one to see if it holds up. I bought these because my three other Honeywell air purifiers, which I've had for nine years, needed to be replaced. Not because they're not working, but because I can't find replacement HEPA filters for them anywhere! I'd recommend Honeywell, but given my 50/50 experience with this model, I'm not so sure about it."
5,Does the job,"Bought this to help reduce the dust in the house which was aggravating my allergic rhinitis (hay fever) as well as the haze caused by irresponsibily set forest fires in a neighboring country blowing over to ours.No bells & whistles on this filter but I like that the unit is economical, light & not too noisy either. The handle & light weight makes it really easy to move around & at it's lowest setting it just hums in the background without being annoying. The permanent HEPA filter means not having to replace expensive filters every few months. You just need to vacuum it with a (HEPA) vacuum every six months or so, although you do need to replace the charcoal pre-filter every few months depending on usage for maximum effectiveness. Would have been great it if were multivoltage (110-220V) so that I wouldn't have to use a step-down converter here in Singapore."
3,Refurbished,I bought this refurbished. I thought it would work fine however it did nothing when I put it on high so I run it on medium or low. It sits by the tv and we have o problem hearing it. I just would not buy one refurbished I learned my lesson.
2,Really disappointed with this unit,I've had this unit a couple of years and am really disappointed with it. It moves the air but the smell it leaves behind makes my nose more stuffy than the dust and pollen I'm trying to eliminate. I read reviews before I bought it that said the smell would disappear after using it for a few hours. This is not the case with the unit I have. I've let it run days at a time in a spare room hoping the smell would disappear but it doesn't.One of the features I was also looking for was a unit quiet enough to use at night. Even on low this unit is noisy.Big waste of money.
2,Very noisy and poor cleaning,I bought the Honeywell 17000 and after trying it sent it straight back. It is really noisy and kept even my deep sleeper husband awake. On the high setting it sounds about like a hair dryer on high. On the low setting it's still much louder than my portable fan that I use for white noise. After returning it I did more research and discovered that it had received a poor rating on air quality from Consumer Reports. I strongly recommend against this model. There are much better and quieter products out there.
1,Didn't help my allergies at all,"I was suffering from respiratory allergies in a new home, and a friend recommended this product. I had high hopes, as my allergies (mold?) was making it hard for me to breathe (and live) in my home.I had this on for days at a time in my home office, which is where I spend most of my time. I noticed absolutely no difference in my condition after using it. Maybe it's because I was in other parts of the home as well - yet I even tried spending the night other places, where I don't have allergies, so that my time outside of the room I work in was limited.I would feel better when I was out of the house, but when I would come back, the symptoms would arise whether or not I had this purifier running or not."
5,Honeywell 17000,"There are several versions of this air purifier made over the years:1700017000N17000-SSome with permanent filters, some don't.I assume there are difference in material/components between the models and therefor the difference on perceived noise of the unit.The Honeywell brand purifiers are made by Kaz. Not Honeywell."
3,The replacement pre-filters require you to cut them down with a pair of scissors,"This is a pretty stupid maintenance requirement, cutting a rather long piece of carbon down by hand and getting carbon on the floor just so you can continue to use the product.I think the purifier is good overall, but Honeywell needs to be less lazy and manufacture a filter that actually fits this product, or else discontinue the product."
2,Unimpressed,"My wife was hoping this would help her allergies. It didn't - in fact, she seemed worse when we were using it. We returned it."
1,Honeywell true Hepa,"I've had this item a few years now. I have not noticed a difference in the air quality at all. I had ordered it because of the high ratings it received. It doesnt circulate air well, nor does it take out any odors. I had a $20 Holmes one with an ionizer that I gave to someone and it still works after 10 years. I wish I had kept it for myself.Im looking for a good true hepa air filter. We've replaced the filters on the HOneywell and it still doesnt get rid of ordors or clean the air."
1,poor!,"This air purifier is advertised as having a charcoal filter, which is needed to remove smells from the air. It has only a 'dusting' of charcoal on the prefilter, which doesn't remove odors for long enough to be useful. The design is also bad: the air intake and outlet aren't well separated, so after a little use, it is putting out dusty air into the room. It might be good for those who need only a HEPA filter, but they're not likely to want to breathe dusty air!The online description of my model was inaccurate, too."
4,my old cat is still alive...,"i purchased this air purifier because I was going away for 2 weeks on holiday and my old cat (who has bad allergies) is mean and won't let anyone else give her pills....she was going to have to go for 2 weeks without her allergy medication. I turned it on (very easy to work) and left it running the whole time I was gone (didn't increase the electricity bill substantially..I was pleasantly surprised). When I came back, she was alive and kicking (well, biting, really.).....so how well does this work? I have no idea. Did it keep the cat alive? I have no idea. I'd like to think it had lots to do with it and brought her tons of relief...but I have no idea. Bottom line is because it was for my cat and not a person, I can get no feedback about the machine's performance. But the cat is still alive!! [="
4,So far so good........for just a month,"What more can you ask of a air filter....loud as expected but very functional. It's NOT a Rabbit, but for the price, it's well worth it..so far."
5,Great Addition,I am a huge Bette fan. This would be a great addition to anyone's collection! Thank you!
1,Don't forget the eggs,"The Crostata di Pinoli recipe on pp. 360-361 includes 2 eggs in the list of ingredients, but does not indicate where the eggs should be added. I suspect that the eggs should be added to the filling because I left them out and ended up with cheesesoup."
5,Classic Wilson Pickett edgy soul sound;,"The ""Midnight Hour"" album put Wilson Pickett's rough, edgy, urgent soul voice right out front in the soul sounds of the mid 60's. His ""from the heart"" voice matched James Brown and Otis Redding in intensity and depth. Listen to ""I Found A Love"" for that deep feeling he was so filled with. Pickett died January 19, 2006 leaving the soul scene missing one of the icons of the 60's breakout soul sounds."
2,john-w-nennol is bang on,"Not enough difference from the original--except the original is better. ""Let It Be"" bootlegs are way better. I always love John's comments on the original, as well as, ""Dig It"" and ""Maggie Mae""--what's Paul's problem anyway!?"
4,Nice extras,"I love Let it Be and I love the Beatles. I had a copy of the original that I borrowed from my sister. I already owned Naked on CD, but I wanted the vinyl. I was a bit disappointed that Naked doesn't have the little extra bits that the original album has... John's weird skatting and such. The little 7"" extra record is pretty neat, but I'd rather have the original. Oh well."
3,Pretty good but..........,"I approached this CD with a bit of skepticism to begin with. I love the Beatles and have everything they ever did.Hearing some of the new mixes was good. I do like the new 'Long and Winding Road' mix as well as 'For You Blue'. Most of them, however, aren't that much different. 'Dig A Pony', 'One After 909', and 'I Me Mine' more or less sound the same, except the sound is crisper.Part of my problem with this project is the fact that the 'Let it Be' album was FAR from their best work. It's hard to take a mediocre song and remix it to make a great song. Unfortunately, except for the three hits on the album, the rest is not up to the Beatles usual standards of greatness.If, by some chance, anyone at EMI should read this, once you get busy remixing and remastering such Beatles masterpieces like 'Abbey Road', 'Sgt Pepper', or ""A Hard Day's Night', then you'll hear Beatles fans everywhere start to cheer!"
3,Beatle Fan,"Does ""Long and Winding Road"" sound like the same track ""deSpectorized"" or a whole new recording? Try as much as I can, I can't hear this new version under the old one at all. Makes you wonder if Paul didn't just take the oppurtunity to just redo it his way. Still enjoy listening to anything done by the Beatles though."
1,Ho hum. Here we go again.,"It must be Christmas. Paul McCartney is releasing yet another version of the Long and Winding Road and Let it Be. I'm surprised he didn't try to put Yesterday on LIBN. I do agree the songs are much better stripped of the Spector production. That's what I thought when I heard them ""naked"" the first time on the Anthology's."
1,Yawn.....,"Well, I eagerly anticipated the arrival of this ""new"" Beatles album and I was supremely disappointed. At a mere 35 minutes, Sir Paul must be laughing his arse off at us poor saps who shelled out our money for this light-weight version of the previous Let It Be album.When compared to the aforementioned disc, this one pales. The Phil Spector version turned a mess into a nice-sounding, solid record. This one simply sounds like unfinished demos.Save your money. If you don't have Let It Be, buy it. If you do, don't waste your money on this useless (yet another) Sir Paul ego trip.Roberta"
2,Disappointed,"I really enjoyed Pullman's Dark Materials and so when I saw ""Lyra's Oxford"" I was excited to read a new one. I neglected to look at the page length. When it came and it was a very small book, I was immediately disappointed. The story itself was okay, but it was so short I just felt short-changed. Pass this one up."
2,Lyra's Oxford by Phillip Pullman,This book was about 60 pages long. My daughter read the entire thing wile waiting for a tire to be changed. Not worth the money.
2,Lyra's Oxford,"I thought the story was okay, but it laked detail. Of course what do you expect from such a short piece."
3,"Overpriced, but lovely.","Philip Pullman, Lyra's Oxford (Knopf, 2003)Lyra's Oxford is a short story and the odd attachment or two published for, essentially, the sole purpose of giving readers one last shot at immersing themselves in a certain universe (or, if you're more cynical, giving the authors one last shot at leeching money from said universe). (cf. A. M. Homes' Appendix A, reviewed here in March, 2004.) It's an attractive, small-format hardcover (cf. A. M. Homes' Appendix A, etc.) that's, for how much actual meat there is in between the covers, horrendously overpriced. (cf. etc.). Still, those who were as enchanted with His Dark Materials as I was will no doubt me more than happy to have one last chance to visit Lyra. This is just as well-written as the trilogy, and is a fine little story. It would go better in an anthology of some sort, however, so more fans could have access to it. ***"
3,The Book of strange stuff,"This book is really weird. It is only 50 pages long and dosnt really mean anything. But it might have to do with another book coming out soon, and some of the things might be made clear later, I don't know. The writing isn't anywhere near as good as the other books. But if you are a real HDM fan, you might find the many extras interesting."
5,can't wait for the book of dust!,"until then, this will have to do! the people who complain about it's shortness and the apparant randomness of it's contents need to read the beginning of the book where it is explained that these things may have something to do with things to come.i think it's a nice little book, and worth having if you are a die-hard hdm fan, but i can see how others might be confused by it."
3,Oxford,"I bought this book hoping to see lots of old characters. i absolutely loved the map, the adds, and the postcard but thought that the story was pretty pointless. It didn't seem to do much and I was able to read it within the night. I think I had worked myself up for a much grander companion novel to HDM so was a bit dissapointed. I think that it all could've waited until the book of dust because it didn't really have much to it. I think the part I was most excited about was the travel guides section, and seeing the one by Mrs Coulter. Otherwise I was pretty unimpressed. I think over all although I loved the cover, adn the extras, the story was pretty bad. I have to get over this and re work my self up for the book of dust. Something which I don't think I should've had to of done."
1,?????????,"I purchased this book with the high hopes of giving me the closure I felt I needed after reading the awesome Golden Compass trilogy. Unfortunately, this did not deliver. In reality, it was a big let down and I was disappointed...very disappointed...I felt this short story was more of an ""extra"" that fitted no where in the trilogy, and to turn it into a quick buck, the author titled it after the original main character to trick people into buying it... Well... he got me! =DI read the entire darn thing while I was in my doctor's waiting room.Simply put, it's a very short story, nothing really to do with the original trilogy, and required no further thought process: you just read the story and is left with nothing to ponder over.Although it was not ""terrible,"" I would not recommend it.As a matter of fact, I gave the book to the friend that made me read the trilogy so he wouldnt waste his money! It's one of those books (and I have many!) that isn't even good enough to stay in my library."
3,Lyra's Oxford,"Good story, not sure why it would be so brief! I'm sure lots of us would be interested in a whole novel instead of a chapter. I won't buy another ""chapter"" , too expensive!"
4,LYRA'S SMALL ADVENTURE,"I loved this little book. It took me back into Lyra's world for a short visit without having to delve into the large books. I could accompany Lyra and Pan on their small adventure, this time without her friends Will and Roger. I love Philip Pullman's descriptions - he transports you to the place in time and you can actually see the characters. His Dark Materials features prominently in my collection and I am pleased to add Lyra's Oxford to it. Just for the record I am 69 y.o. I think there are different facets in Pullman's books to appeal to all ages.This is a great little quick fix for Philip Pullman fans."
2,Teaser not a book.,This story is so small that it will not become a chapter in the three book series written by the same author.This book is not for a serious reader. Someone looking for a collector item can buy this book. If you are looking for serious reading avoid this book.
2,Good Story but not worth the price,"I recently finish reading the ""His Dark Materials"" trilogy, and was still hungry for more when I came across Lyra's Oxford. Thinking that a short story might be fun I ordered the book. I suppose my expectations were a little too high. The story itself is OK, but it left me feeling somewhat empty. The details that Pullman used to fill out his other books just aren't there, and the reader is left feeling like it was a rush job. When factoring in the cost of the book, I'd say it just wasn't worth it."
2,coulda been made better,"This is a short story pretending it's a novel. If the story had been expanded/continued it could have been very good. As is, it's a nice introduction. I think the publishers wanted a follow-on but the author wasn't interested and this is the resulting compromise."
4,Interesting little book,"This book is a great little companion to the ""His dark matierials"" trilogy. It comes with more than just a short story, Inside the book are maps and other clues to the next story by Philip Pullman."
3,"If you really must know, spend your money","SPOILER FREE: It may be another decent addition to Pullman's universe, but this book is a pamphlet. The book, at first hold loses half its weight once you remove the map, which by the way is all but familiar to me. Even though the story is exciting with a familiar face that we wanted to see more of, it just needs more text to satisfy a fan. I enjoyed the skinny novel, but I just wish it had more to offer. You can read it in an hour which makes it seem like Pullman just had to leave the party as soon as he arrived. So bottom line: if you really wish to know what happens next then spend your money. Keep in mind that it is SHORT and it will be over before you know it."
3,An Interesting Short Story,"Upon finishing the ""His Dark Materials"" trilogy I was very excited to find this look into Lyra's Oxford. Taking place two years after the end of the trilogy I was hoping to learn about Lyra's experiences and the woman she was turning into. Sadly, while this is a fun and interesting short story, it does not really add to Lyra's character and we see her very much the same as at the end of the trilogy.For anyone who loved the trilogy this book is a must. But don't expect greatness, just a fun hour."
2,An Obvious Attempt To Make A Few More Dollars,"Unfortunately it seems many authors are willing to sell themselves out in order to make a few more dollars. Lyra's Oxford is just that. The first three books in this series where well written, continued to grow upon a larger idea, and kept the reader mesmerized. Lyra's Oxford is merely a very very short story, at a full novel price, that is lacking in everything, except the authors willingness to squeeze an additional 6-7 dollars out of his loyal readers. My recommendation is to not waste your money or time, you will be dissapointed."
4,Expecting a bit more...,"I don't exactly get the point of this book. I mean, it is an okay read, but even if you are a big fan of the His Dark Materials series like me, this book is hardly necessary to read. It's just a little tiny story that only took me about half an hour to read. I just really don't get why this book was written. I doesn't really tell me anything new and only focuses on the story at hand. I was hoping they would tell me more about Lyra now, and everything that has happened over the past two years, or even some new piece of information. Whatever the case, read away. It's not disappointing, I just thought it would be more useful."
3,Cliff Hanger,"It is a very short story that leaves you with more questions instead of answers; despite this, the inserts are interesting."
3,B-,"Giving just a taste of the former glory that was the His Dark Materials Trilogy, Pullman unfortunately disappoints the reader with this near-gimmick of a short story. Taking up space with what should have been words are (albeit charming) black prints depicting some of the scenes described, as well as (again, albeit charming) postcards and maps that have the ability of confusing the reader. Luckily, the actual story line is decent, and whilst in the middle of it, found myself getting pulled right back into the fantasy world he created. The ending hints at something more to come, and the entire tone of the piece is quite suspicious, as if the clever author had something hiding up his proverbial sleeve. The descriptions lacked the luster of his previous work, and one finds themselves wishing for the insanely visual imagery that he is known for. The characters were a bit flat, but the story still gripped. We all know Pullman is capable of so much more - so why this interlude?"
5,Lyra's Oxford,"This was a very good addition to the Dark Materials series. I enjoyed it very much. The only bad thing I can think of, was it was way too short."
3,Very Short -= Quick read,This doesn't carry the same plot line as the Dark Materials series. It has the same charachters with a new story but it's very short and leaves a lot to be desired.
4,A very tasty chocolate mint after dinner!,"It's true that this book is short beyond even what I had assumed reading some of the negative reviews. It is indeed more like a ""teaser"". However, it is deliciously and luxuriously written and gives us a tiny taste of Lyra's world. This to me is worth it. Like after a large, savory feast, a tasty chocolate mint to delight and perhaps cleanse the palate for the next course... A quick read that reminds us why we love His Dark Materials so much. Recommended."
3,So plain and simple.,"I'm a fan of Phillip Pullman, specially with his Northern Lights Trilogy. That was the reason why I bought this. I was a bit disappointed. I was expecting more from the story, I was hoping more adventure that Lyra would be tackling and alot of mysteries, but it was just like that, so simple, like reading the whole thing in an hour. I would want to wonder more and stay long like what Phillip Pullman had done with his Trilogy, where you will be so tantalize with the stories, but with this one, its just like a scratch story, so plain, and I guess its just mainly for kids, but I know, kids who loved the trilogy would also ask for more."
4,Enchanting!,"Yes, it's short; no, it's not the 'Golden Compass.' It is a charming and good read! I hope that Mr. Pullman will continue writing more short stories about Lyra (& maybe even Will, Mr Pullman?) and maybe continue to make Sebastian Makepeace a recurring character. I would like to see a whole book of ""Lyra's Short Stories"" if they are as good as this."
2,Too Short!,"First of all, the actual story is ONLY 47 pages long, and to add to that the print is HUGE, and there are pictures on the pages. I had just finished reading the His Dark Materials and loved it so I thought this book may be interesting enough to read. The story isn't very good at all. There's no excitement, I do understand that this is a ""stepping stone"" book, leading up to the ""The Book of Dust"" however, it's hardly worth reading. I gave it 2 stars because it does include some interesting ""artifacts"" which may be useful once ""Dust"" comes out. I just wish Mr. Pullman would hurry up with it! I can't imagine the wait some people (who got this book back in 2003) have endured. Hopefully the new book will be out soon. Overall, this story took about 15 minutes to read, but I would recommend it to anyone who plans on reading the next book, solely for the materials it comes with."
2,Lyra's tiny book,Much too short. (...) I suggest not buying it. The story is so abbrieviated that not much happens. The best thing about this book is its interesting size and colour. The binding is so thick its gunna last for ages. (...)
3,Could have been a lot better,"It was alright but so short. After the HDM trilogy, i was expecting something momentous, not this!"
3,Only for big fans of the series,"There is not much story value to this book, but I am greedy for anything His Dark Materials. If you are like me and cannot get enough, go ahead and get this book. But don't expect too much, and don't pay too much I found it online for less than $5 total. This may be a gimmick by the author to make more money, but I am a sucker for this series and I will buy anything related to the masterpiece that is ""His Dark Materials""."
2,"Even if you love Lyra, it's not worth the Lira","I enjoyed the ""His Dark Materials"" trilogy as much as anyone, however this product just isn't a good value for the money. It consists of a short story, and not a particularly great one, along with a corny, uninspired map, postcard, and cruise leaflet supposedly from ""Lyra's Oxford"".The short story advances the ""related universe"" philosophy of the trilogy only a small bit, and not in a particularly ground-breaking direction.None of the three pieces of paraphenalia advances the ""story line"" of the trilogy at all (although there is some unimaginative humor hidden in them).I would suggest looking for this book in the library or borrowing it from a friend, if you are worried that you might be missing something. It only takes a few minutes to read it anyway."
1,Not worth the $$$,"I went out and bought this book at a local book store. I had been anticipating it's arrival for weeks, being a huge HDM fan. (I've read the trilogy at least 8 times.) I picked it up, and was suprised. I was expecting something much much larger. But I took it home, read it, and promptly took it back. It was awful. It was almost like someone else wrote the book. I think I'll just re-read the trilogy if I get to missing Will and Lyra."
2,Don't judge a book by its cover,"I absolutely loved Phillip Pullman's His Dark Materials series so I was thrilled when I discovered he had created another story in that universe. Lyra's Oxford has a truly beautiful cover of red cloth and a colored woodcut illustration. The book also has many such ""goodies"" included inside. The actual story inside; however, was extremely disappointing. We learn only the tiniest bit more about Lyra's life after The Amber Spyglass. The plot was not developed or intricate. What did I expect out 49 pages? An enjoyable story, that's what, not a turnabout mystery easily explained at the end like Scooby Doo cartoon. I will read Pullman's works in the future, but I advise other readers not to buy this book before checking it out from your library first."
3,One Short Book,"I like all Philip Pullman's works but this one was only49 pages which is a pretty lame book even if you're the best author in the world. this book is at the price of $.20 a page which is pretty expensive to me i would only recommend this book to a rich person, an enemy, or some obssesed with his dark materials like myselfsend E-MAIL to VIXXER282 at yahoo.com"
2,Lyra's Oxford,"Written by Luke/ChallengersThe book I read was Lyra's Oxford, Written by Phillip Pullman. The main characters are Lyra, and Pan. Lyra and Pan were friends who lived in Oxford, England.At the beginning of the story Lyra and Pan were trying to figure out bird signs. For example, how the birds were flying and why they flew in a ""V"" shape.Lyra has a daemon and the daemon want Lyra to find Dr. Polstead, an alchemist. I think this because the daemon wanted to know the secret of how to turn lead into gold. At the end of the story Lyra and Pan found Dr. Polstead and ask him how he turns lead into gold. He said he doesn't turn lead into gold. The book is easy to read but in some parts of the book it is hard to understand.If you like to use your imagination this is a great book for you. I think if you like birds, this is a good too! On a scale from 1-5, I give it a 2 because it was not very good. It wasn't that interesting and it didn't have have enough detail to hold my attention."
4,"Exceedingly short, but tantalizing glimpse of possible future book...","This is a single day in Lyra's life, after she has finished her Dark Materials adventures.It is tantalising, to say the least -- a glimpse of a future, as yet unpublished, continuation of these wonderful novels. I would recommend ""Lyra's Oxford"" to anyone who liked His Dark Materials; it's a very nicely produced slim volume, with a cloth cover, fold-out maps of Lyra's Oxford, and postcards written by characters from the novels.But be warned -- it is very short!"
5,Short and sweet,"Pullman is a genius in his writing, and this small tale is such a great tease after the Dark Materials work. But, the combination of the illustrations and other knick-knacks are just clever and fun. If you liked His Dark Materials, you will enjoy this as well."
1,A Bad Single,"Wait Forever is a strong beatmix hit from the solo album released in 2001 of Robin Gibb - Magnet. Wait Forever , the song itself is absolutely the best of all, close to Please, but in this single, it sounds a bit weird with the Shanghai Remix. Not as good as the single please"
4,A bad day on the Western Front,"This book is a hostory of the British Army on its worst day in hitory. On this day theBritish Army lost over 20,000 killed. This book is highly detailed and informative. My only problem with this book is that the author refuses to blame the British comanders who ordered their men to certain death."
2,Buyer Beware,"When I received the battery the terminals were quite worn down and the battery had shown extensive signs of use (e.g., worn casing, dirt on the casing). While the manufacturer has agreed to replace the item (but after a week it hasn't arrived and I never received a shipping number or shipping confirmation), I must warn people that the products received may not be new and to carefully checkAt least the battery did work because my old one had a dead cell."
4,Blackberry battery,"Not much to say about this, but the price was right and it was the proper battery for the application. It seems to be taking a charge and holding it as well as the OEM battery."
5,So thankful to have a bulk source!,I have been looking for a good source for high quality fish food in bulk...and I finally found one! The price is SO much better than buying the little packages locally. We have several tanks...the largest being 125 gallons...so finding a good price on fish food is fantastic for us.The tub says this food is formulated for clearer water and I think it really is clearer with this product than other foods we have used...so I am very happy!
3,Seems good but fish are not impressed.,"This product seems just fine. However, I notice that my fish do not like it nearly as much as the HBH Tropical Flake Frenzy that I was feeding prior to this. I have 3 Trimacs (large South American Cichlids) which loved the HBH but completely ignore this. All in all, it seems similar to other well known brands of standard flake food, i.e. not the best."
3,Combat Signal Soldier,"Col. Fitz-Enz's account of his time in Vietnam is a very entertaining look at a seldom-explored profession within the Army- that of a communications officer. While the Colonel started out as a photographer -not your typical career field for the army, but certainly a good one -his experience as first a platoon leader then company commander gives us a small look at what it was like back then; funny how some things have yet to change. His book is not set in a strict chronological order, but you get a feeling of how events transpired and their effect on his career. I highly recommend this book for those who have been or are contemplating careers as Signal officers."
4,An excellent contribution,"For those with an interest in early imperial China, this is an exceptional resource. It's quite readable and detailed enough to provide a solid background for narrower studies or to provide Tang-specific information to a Chinese history generalist. For those with more academic needs, I would still recommend it, but would note that Benn has chosen readability over extreme granularity of detail -- e.g., we read about ""a son of the emperor,"" rather than learning the prince's name in Chinese characters and in English."
2,They cook nice but the outside has no Non Stick,After only 4 months of use these pans look like the one I replaced them with which are 5 years old. They do not clean up very easily since the outside of the pan has no protection agains foods sticking and staining the suface. Would recommend finding something that has non stick inside and out!
4,An intense experience of melancholy...,"I'm usually not a big fan of the death/doom sound (too many damn My Dying Bride clones!), but when I first heard Rapture, I was taken aback. The band undeniably have a direct mid-period Katatonia influence, with up-tempo drum beats and inherently emotional riffs and lyrics, but the band also have some oft-overlooked clean vocals, adding a beautiful and majestic touch to the bleak and depressing atmosphere already on this album. Musically, the band is quite above average, creating some great dual-guitar interaction and crafting some truly awesome riffs. There are also some excellent acoustic atmospheric moments with clean vocals that provide a nice break from the depressive attack of the album. Depression is the keyword here. Check it out if you're into the up-tempo, mid-period Katatonia sound, or if you're just looking for some well-crafted, emotional music."
5,a must have,"I have the vinyl. This is an alblum of all the creatures of the forest preparing for - attending - and going home from the ""Butterfly Ball and the Grasshoppers feast. It is truly a tragedy that this alblum is no longer available. There is also an video for this alblum. If either becomes available please notify me."
1,poor quality for price,The actual item is much shorter than what is pictured and is barely a top. The material is rough and the elastic is thin. This is poor quality even with the discounted price.
1,stuck in the 70',I can not believe that this is a DVD made in 2004 it so old and corny ... I did not like it and my kids were not in love with it either
5,Dilbert in prose,"This book is the prose equivalent of the cartoon strip Dilbert. All the characters are there - the clueless boss, the lazy and dishonest employee and the hardworking employee who never seems to get any support. We're only missing Dogbert. Anyone who has ever worked in Manufacturing will find many of the situations truly hilarious.This was a very funny and witty book. I found myself laughing out loud at some of the situations when I read them, and laughing even harder hours later when I had a chance to digest them. I look forward to the next book from this author."
5,Review of Saeven Summits,"Book given to me by Dick Bass, following a a Yale alumni trip to China. It is a fascinating account of climbing the highest mountain on esch continent, varying greatly in difficulty."
1,False Advertizing,"The hat is advertized for use in the jungle or at the beach, however, the manufacturer states in the directions that came with the hat, ""Do Not Get Wet"" and ""Do Not Wash"". This is not stated on the product web page.It is also not clear that headgear cannot be returned. There is no size chart to help you choose which size to get.I will no longer purchase from Panama Jack."
1,Korean War stories were boring,Stuff like this is better to watch on YouTube. I was not really interested in stories about people that did not do much in Korea. What was the point of telling me you were mainly bored?
1,Worthless!,"This video has two non-people sitting at a desk smiling their faces off, giving ABSOLUTELY NOTHING usefull about Front Page. I want my money back! Couldn't throw it in the trash fast enough!"
3,Interesting,"I read Churchward's MU series years ago. It kept me spellbound at the time. It was incredibly fascinating to think that there was another lost civilization OLDER than even Atlantis and more advanced. I wondered at the time how this had gotten past Edgar Cayce's readings on Atlantis if Mu was even older. As I read all of his series, each book was less and less interesting - much in the same way Von Daniken's books became less impressive with each bit of ""new"" information that he revealed. My one big complaint about Churchward was his glaring and offensive racism. You can't help but notice how the more advanced peoples were always white and that there was a hierarchical system of races in which whites were always at the top. So much for a truly advanced enlightened people. He also took great pleasure, it seems, in bashing Jews. Churchward was definitely a man of his times, sorry to say, but totally unsurprising, even though he was incredibly offensive in that regard."
1,run and hide from the trachtenbergs!!!!!!!!!!,i saw this family peform this weekend at 45 bleeker in nyc. please try and imagine 13 yr old rachel play a ukele badly while singing john bonham songs to the 4 yr olds sitting in the front row as ma-trachtenberg acted out the songs on a felt story board attached to a suitcase. i won't mention jason and his cast of friends that didn't really have a clue. the 4 yr olds really liked it but anyone over 5yrs old was so over it all!!! and if tina and jason didn't get it ... rachel is BORED with you all. she's your gimmick and she grown tired of you!!!
4,Best gloves I own,"I have a pair of these Geier roper style kangaroo leather gloves for riding my motorcycle and I absolutely LOVE them!! The sizing chart worked perfectly for me as mine fit like a latex glove to my hand.The leather is much softer than my other calfskin gloves and because it is thinner you can feel EVERYTHING with your fingers; for example I can actually feel the bumps of all the numbers on my credit card which I cant feel at all in normal gloves, and it even works with my touchscreen phone!The only reason I didn't give it the full 5 stars is because a couple of stitches by the wrist edge has come out and were sticking up when it arrived; I simply cut them off flush with some sewing scissors and have had no other thread issues yet and I wear them every day. Highly recommend Geier gloves."
5,"More focused, more mature, classic Guano Apes (finally!)","This album is by far the best work Guano Apes have put out. I own both their previous albums, but in spite of moments of brilliance (including their debut single, ""Open Your Eyes"", neither of them really succeeded in channelling the obvious energy of the group consistently into songs that clicked. Walking on a Thin Line finally delivers, lining up song after song of classic Guano Apes. This album is a bit lighter on the manic joke songs than the previous albums, which is probably a good thing. While they have done decent light-hearted songs as B-sides (""Candy Love"") and collaborations (""Kumba Yo"") in the past, the darker, more sincere material is what Guano Apes do best. Songs like ""Quietly"", ""Storm"", and ""Kiss the Dawn"" on this album are especially successful in this vein. This album single-handedly puts Guano Apes in the ranks of the best rock bands of the world at the moment."
4,America needs to open it's eyes,"After telling my buddy a few years back about a little band with a sweet song called ""Open Your Eyes"" i saw on mtv, i recieved an e-mail last night from him with a songs from there new album that he purchased. I must say that I just ordered my copy and urge all of you to do the same. The first Single ""You can't stop me"" has the same power and energy like ""Open your eyes"" did. And some of the other new songs on this album sound just as powerful. Hopefully America will ""Open It's Eyes"". MTV PLAY THIS ALBUM"
5,Catchy tunes that both my 3 and 7 year olds like!,It's hard to find anything that my 3 yr old and 7 yr. old girls agree on. Hi-5 and Imagination Movers CDs are a blessing!
5,5 High Starts for Hi-5,Our 2 year old grandson loves Hi-5. One of his favorite scenes is when Shaun is playing a song called Congo Congo Boom Boom Boom. We are curretly looking for that DVD so he can watch it again and again. Can someone let me know if there is a DVD of that segment in one of them. It would be greatly appreciated.
5,Hi5 DVD'S (Great!),I bought vol 1-3 in the Hi5 DVD's my child is 22 months old and she loves Hi5 and all their sing along song and games.You should just she her dancing around the house when these DVD's are playing.Just great.
5,Hi-5: Making Music,I searched for weeks for the video and finally found it here. My son absolutely loves it. He is a big Hi-5 fan and it was nice to see some different episodes. I wish there were a few more.
3,Great film but UK dvd is wrong OAR,"In Search of the Castaways was one of my favourate films as a child and I still enjoy it now 40 years later... Its one of the Disney films that seem to stand up well even with the dated special effects and hopelessly oldfashion English mannersUnfortunately, in spite of what Disney might claim, the picture on the British DVD is definately cropped on either side... Faces and objects are sometimes half off screen and it is blatantly obvious that the picture has been cropped... It isn't that cropped ... It was probably originally something like 1.66.1 or 1.78.1 ... Though it could have been 1.85.1 ... It was so long ago I can't remember in the cinemaLets hope the american dvd sorts this problem out... I may even order a new copy after I see some reviews"
2,In Search Of The Widescreen Version!,"Ok, Disney! Let's get our act together (remember, even Hayley Mills sang ""Let's Get Together). Please release this fun adventure in widescreen."
3,so sad,"I was fortunate enough to see this film in the theatre as a child and was blown away by each scene. How the Disney people could be so uncaring, lazy, or greedy, to not put this and other Disney jewels in wide screen is an absolute crime. Walt would never have let that happen. So many young people are missing out. So Sad. Should be 5 stars."
5,Fantastic fun,It is one of the greatest movies that has ever been made.The story and all of the adventures that take place all over the globe is fun.
4,It IS missing part of the picture,"It has been on TV over here, and in widescreen. I have compared individual frames of the widescreen version with the version on this DVD and the DVD version is cropped as a standard pan-and-scan film, and not the other way round, as has been suggested.It's a great shame because it's such an enjoyable film, but the spectacular effects look so much better in widescreen. Come on Disney, let's have the proper version."
4,"Wonderful adventure, obscure Jules Verne","The action set-pieces in this are nothing short of visually spectacular, as Disney was always on the cutting-edge, years ahead any other studio. One sequence in particular, when the characters cling for their lives to a piece of ice SLIDING down a mountainside following a landslide, I believe inspired a similar (if not as logical) scene in INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM (Spielberg has long been a huge Disney fan!). On the other hand, like some Roger Moore 007 films, the plot is strung along so thinly between action scenes at times it's hard to recall how and why the characters got where they are! I'm not entirely sure, but based on a footnote in the Verne novel THE MYSTERIOUS ISLAND, I believe the book this is based on is actually titled ""CAPTAIN GRANT'S CHILDREN"". (Anyone who knows better, please let me know!)"
1,Could not watch it,Movie was not able to use since it was made to work in England and NOT the USA. Was sent back
4,Good Family Fun,This is a great film for the whole family!! Took me back to childhhod where anything and everything is possiable!
1,Gypped with Glee,"They very happily sold me a DVD that would not work in our ""region."" I see that I am not the first to be cheated either.They would not even consider trading the item for one that would work in the U.S. What jerks. I will never buy from them again."
1,worst film I have ever seen,"The only reason to rent this film is so that you can laugh at the stupidity of it. The writing was terrible, the plot so unrealistic, and the ""special effects"" horrible. This is by far the cheesiest and dumbest film ever made. Why Haley Mills agreed to star in it is beyond me."
1,Disappointed,"I was really looking forward to the release of this movie, but I will not buy a movie in 1:33 ratio when it has been cropped. After reading the other reviews, what I feared seems to be true. The movie was not filmed in 1:33; yet Disney did not seem to think it was worth the trouble to put out a great DVD in the original aspect. They did this with ""That Darn Cat"" as well; another great movie I won't be purchasing because of the inferior quality of the DVD. They did this before when they first put out ""The Absent-Minded Professor"". Thankfully they put out another edition several months later that was in the original aspect, 1:66. I'm hoping they will do the same with ""Castaways"" & ""That Darn Cat"" as soon as possible! I will wait to purchase them when that happens."
4,Crisp Upbeat Follow-Up,"Canadian pop rock legend Glass Tiger is known by sensational major debut THIN RED LINE in 1986 which bore huge hits such as Don't Forget Me and Someday. Their follow-up in 1988 is also nice enjoyable AOR work though not as promoted as aforementioned.The opening DIAMOND SUN is a nice uptempo rocker somewhat remniscent of Hooter's debut. FAR AWAY FROM HERE keeps the beat of their debut and should have aired much more. A LIFETIME OF MOMENTS is well-produced emotional ballad while MY SONG uses traditional instruments curtly just as HOOTERS and BRUCE HORNSBY did. WORLDS CRUMBLE reminds me of some of excellent TOTO ballads.SEND YOUR LOVE will culminate 80s upbeat pop mood and you would want to play this with full volume. THIS ISLAND EARTH the last track shows moody side of the band well.Verdict: Nice follow-up.Rating: 82 out of 100Recommended for Canadian AOR fans who loves BRYAN ADAMS, CORY HART, HONEYMOON SUITE and SAGA. Also for Hooters, Cutting Crew, Survivor fans."
2,hmmm,"I enjoyed their previous albums and I was hoping that this one would do the same as well. But I guess not. I can't believe people are giving them 5 stars. There isn't much of originality here, so today I sold the CD.The End."
2,another dissapointment in hardcore this year!!!!,"i love evergreen terrace and i hate to give them a bad review but this album is so unlike their previous material. I respect a band that tries to improve their music by musicianship but it sounds like their trying to fit in with the crowd and their no longer unique(generic sounding). it's a heavy album though the songs have no heart.I would suggest buying ET's album ""losing all hope is freedom""if your a new fan, it's the best hardcore cd I've heard this decade. peace"
4,I like 'em okay,I'm no expert on emo/metal/hardcore/screamo/all other genres of music. But I like this CD! I didn't regret buying it. It's a very rocking hard & heavy and there's a lot of melodic parts which you can sing along to. :D But some of the songs to sound alike at first.But this whole CD is really tight & sounds great!
2,Not as Advertised,"I have read several books relating to the Boston Celtics and their dynasty years. I was eager to get this one as the product description states it is ""... a season-by-season history of their dynasty ..."" It is not. It is a decent account of the players and the history of the times, but as I said, I had read those accounts before. It does not go through season-by-season. The product description needs to be changed. I was very disappointed."
5,"A Powerful, Inspiring Story of Hope and Determination","The Fire Within will leave you with a knowing that, no matter what, you can overcome any obstacle in your life. You will feel inspired to live your life as the gift that it is. Valerie's story is an incrredible journey of a young woman who refused to be stopped, even by a devastating illness that would have caused most people to give up altogether. I couldn't put it down.Jim Donovan, author, Handbook to a Happier Life"
5,An inspiration to all stroke victims,A must read. Could not put the book down until I finished it.Val is a tower of strength for all stroke victims.A dear friend of mine just recently had a stroke and he is reading my copy of Val's book.
2,Sent me the wrong product,I got the wrong item. I paid $20 and I got an item worth $5. They refunded me the money
1,GREAT COOKIES IF THEY ARE FRESH!,"Nabisco Snack Wells Creme Sandwich Cookies 1.7 oz. (Pack of 12) 20.4 oz. netI purchased these cookies in the store several times and thought they were a great alternative to other indulgences. When I saw them on Amazon, I thought it would be a super savings. However, these cookies must be fresh, or they are simply not worth eating. The photo above is a very good sample of some very old and dried out cookies. When they were received in fresh condition, they were excellent, with soft moist cake and marshmallow and a chocolate coating that was a solid, shiney dark brown. In this photo above you can see a very dried out product with an old and pale, discolored coating. I ordered 3 seperate times, 1st box was ""great"" other two were not even edible. 1 FOR 3 MAKES THEM A VERY POOR VALUE.Nabisco Snack Wells Creme Sandwich Cookies 1.7 oz. (Pack of 12) 20.4 oz. net"
5,Thank Goodness For These Little Tasty Snacks,"I could eat a devils food cake a day. . .but then, I'd be so big I would require my own zip code. So I'm darn glad the folks at Nabisco came up with SNACKWELL'S DEVILS FOOD COOKIES. These are the real deal: a little devils food cake, surrounded by a marshmellow layer, covered in chocolate. Zero fat, zero cholesterol, only 50 calories--but this little snack sure doesn't taste like no fat/no cholesterol. It tastes like sheer indulgence, and that's always a good thing.So I always keep a box around when the sweet tooth starts to take over and I'm needing some guilt-free pleasure. SNACKWELL'S DEVILS FOOD COOKIES. Devilishly good.--D. Mikels, Esq."
2,A good deal?,"I love these cookies, generally, and the price is great here on Amazon, but sometimes I question where they come from. In March, I received a shipment (TWELVE boxes) with an expiration date of 12 March 2011. I thought that was kinda ""iffy"", and the cookies were a bit worn (they had that patina of old chocolate), but they were edible, so, okay. In April, the expiration date was sometime in the far future (September or October of 2011), so I figured the March shipment was a fluke. In May, the expiration date was *again* 12 March 2011!! They were PAST expiration.Of course, I'm a carb freak so that didn't stop me from eating them, but, C'MON!! I'm almost scared to get my next shipment."
5,Great for chocoholics,"These cookie-cakes are pretty darn good and chocolatey. A bit too sweet for my taste because of the marshmellow layer doesn't prevent me from scarfing down a few, and I do so guilt-free. Kids should love these since they taste like pure junk food, and I mean that as a compliment. Hard to believe they have zero fat."
4,Same cookie in Family Dollar for less.,"If you have a Family Dollar store near you and you like this cookie you are in luck. The same cookie-I mean exactly the same is sold under the Family Gourmet name. At one time FD had duplicated Nabisco's packaging, now its in a green and white box. These Devil's Food cookies cost $1.00 as oppposed to N's supermarket prices of close to $4.00 if not on sale. They are probably made in the the same factory. Plus they have a money back guarantee."
5,An excellent place to start,Larry Helyer does an excellent job of introducing most of the relevent literature of the Second Temple period and its general influence on the writers of the New Testament and the Early Church. Excellent review or introduction depending on your background. I think this should be mandatory reading for every pastor and bible student. Well written with many chapter breaks to keep the organization of this large volume. This is the context of the New Testament that most Christians are not even aware exists. I have already recommended this texts to many people.
4,Anyone can do it!,"This book is an invaluable source for fresh window dressing ideas, as well as old favorites, that can be easily constructed using the clear, detailed instructions. The drawings and photos really clear up any confusion, too. I loved the ""materials list"" because it usually reminded me of some item I would have forgotten at the fabric store! Even though I have sewn many window treatments, the ""Tips"" always solved some problem before it messed up my project! I highly recommend this book for both the novice and the professional who is looking for some fresh ideas."
3,Works but is plastic,"This ring works but it is plastic and cheap. I thought it was more sturdy but it will work for stopping the drip. I rated it higher because it does do what it says, I just expected something more solid."
4,Clear and concise.,"My 14 year old daughter needed research on myths and legends; thus this book's title was obvious. As per her review, it was interesting, easy to read and informative. She was able to get all of the information she needed from the book and enjoyed reading it as well. She would definitely recommend it to her peers."
1,doesn't work on my hard drive,"I bought a western digital caviar se 500gb and it came without a sata cable so I bought this because it was cheap. I connected it and turned on my computer and it didn't recognize a new hard drive. I thought maybe I had to configure my settings, but it just didn't show. I then switched the sata cable with my first hard drive and then when I turned on my computer it worked but now I have to buy a new cable so I can connect both my hard drives. So I would stay away from this, Belkin is cheap and there is a reason for it, compatibility or bad product?"
1,"Hmmm, I've seen this book before...","I'll keep it simple: if you want to read a great novel with the title, ""The Kid Who Batted 1.000"" read the ORIGINAL, written in the 50's by Bob Allison and Frank Ernest Hill."
3,"Not his best, but still worth the read.","McAllister is better when writing about golf, but this was an enjoyable read. I especially liked the trivia about the evolution of the game."
1,I thought I was ordering the book and only recieved the DVD.,I thought I was ordering the book and only recieved the DVD. Very disappointed. The ad was very confusing. Skip this
2,Good book but not as described,"As a new mandolin player I like to hear the music I am reading. This book was supposed to come with a CD with all of the lessons so I could hear what I am trying to learn. Instead I received a ""Bonus"" DVD which has a fairly nice introductory course on Mandolin playing. It is instructive and redundant as it just goes over most of the lessons in the book. I did not receive any CD with all of the musical lessons or back tracks as promised. So, after watching the DVD, I am left without any sound clues to work through all of the real lessons myself.Had I known this, I wold not have bought this book"
2,Good Value but careful,Buying these products in bulk will save you a dollar - but i have found that most of these 25 count testing strips expire in a year - not good when you are only going to test it on your self.
1,selling my address is illegal,"It don't got nottin to do with the product as it is a medical item which they neithermanufacture nor replace with a generic version.The problem and it is a big one was the selling of my address to Stamps.com which emailed me three pages of adds to inform me that ""something was mailedto me by TEST MEDICAL SYMPTOMS @ HOME"".For that I also blame Amazon as I expect it to insure that its sellers respect the privacy of Internet Commerceturk"
2,Too Much Black and White,"Good book, lousy printing job (published should be shot. The mighty dodge Dart deserves better. more of these little jewels have hit the road (and deer, possums, snakes, lawyers...) than any other single model. The A-body MOPARS should have their own section in the Library of Congress. Thank you Walter P."
1,Archaic software protection scheme.. Avoid this product!,"If you have more than one pda, palm, pocket pc or smartphone and travelplans limits the number of items you want to bring along, forget the idea that you can just use your bought tomtom software on any of those pda's at random. Nope, TomTom only allows you to use the software on the pda you activate it on. Customer support insinuated that otherwise the customer would only start to give illegal copies to all their friends and family. ""that's not how we can do business"", the only alternative is/was to buy separate software packages for each pda you use or plan to use. Smart thinking for a company who seems to like to insult the intellect of their buying public. Avoid this product until they figure out how to support buyers who pay legally for their software license."
1,Installation problems? Forget help.,"I had installation problems with this system. Poor instructions, poor website, and poor service on the phone. I'm still waiting for a call back from their customer ""service."""
3,"Good maps, poor connection","I would NOT recommend getting a wireless GPS version from TomTom. Their maps and software are great, but I've had nothing but trouble getting my wireless GPS to connect with my Palm. Usually, it takes me about 5-20mins before every trip and at least one Palm reset to get the PDA and the GPS to connect. Might be something wrong with my particular setup, but software updates and contacting TomTom support don't help at all.On the positive side, I love the software - the maps are very clear, the directions are good and timely, and once/when I get my GPS to connect to the Palm, it's a great road companion. In short, I'm going to try to downgrade to a wired version (or a all-in-one GPS system), and would highly recommend everyone to do the same."
1,Poor Satellite reception,"The TomTom software is great, but the receiver is terrible. My receiver only locked onto the satellites maybe 2/10 tries. I have stood outside with an unobstructed view of the sky and have had no luck. I thought the first unit was defective, so I sent it back for a replacement. Same problem with the second unit. Then, a friend of mine happened to buy one and had the same problem. Sorry, TomTom. Three strikes and you are out."
2,Neat but not great!!,"Product installed & works good on my Dell Axium X50. Biggest problem is the maps. They are terrible. This thing thinks that the highway between San Antonio, Texas & Corpus Christi, Texas Is IH 10. It is really IH 37!! Any map shows that highway correctly. Some street addresses are off by as much as 4 blocks. I would not buy this product again!!"
4,Needs Updated POI,"Well I just love my Tom Tom on my Treo 650. Works great. Only got me lost ONCE. I was headed to Sixe Flags Great Adventure (in NJ). Used the POI instead of entering the address. It took me to Cherry Hill NJ!!! But its always dead on when I enter the address. If they update the POI, then I would give it 5 stars. Also the GPS reciever should give battery level to the PDA so that you don't have to guess if you have enough juice for the trip."
1,Not for USA and Palm treo,I have had nothing but problems with the Tom Tom Support. They have no US phone numbers and their website is not very helpful. If you want a Palm treo GPS navigator I sugest you go with someone else.
2,Idiotic copy-protection will leave you in the lurch,"A fine product in use, but with an Achilles heel that should make any heavy, business, user avoid it like the plague.Treos break and get replaced, and if you're a heavy business traveler, this will happen probably once or twice a year. TomTom apparently doesn't realize this, since Navigator 5 allows you to activate it exactly twice (on your original, and one replacement Treo), before it refuses to activate again. You'd think they'd be bright enough to cross-reference w/ the Treo device's phone number, or something along those lines, to realize that you are the very same person who paid good money for, and activated, the software previously. Instead, it just refuses to work.If you then follow the instructions from their Web site to resolve activation problems, you are eventually led to a screen which, while labeled Step 1 (of 3), is a broken Web page from which you can accomplish nothing.Shameful."
5,"Clever, simple sign","Depending on your taste, this seems to be a clever way to comicaly get a point across. Quality seems good. Wire in the back for hanging took a little manipulating to make sure the sign couldn't be easily taken down by vandals. Met my expectations."
1,A dedicated calculator book; nothinmg more!,"actual teaching covers not more than 5 to 10 percent of the pages in this book filled with art-work! Still, it teaches lots of the keystroke basics of the hp12c. Combine this book with mr. tirone's professional real estate problem solving book and you have a very nice foundation for real estate and appraisal people."
3,Good with the right media,I was pleased with the ease of connecting the unit and its small footprint. I was not as pleased when I tried recording with Phillips media I happened to have. It is a little upsetting that there are only four manufacturer's media that work in this unit. C'mon Sony!
1,Beware,"Similar to the review before mine. I bought this because i thought it records on both -/+ formats. Even on the unit it says - and + but it only records to + which isn't compatible with a lot of players. i inserted a dvd-r, and it said please insert a dvd+r or +rw... bummer i had high hopes for this thing. up on eBay it goes."
1,Don't waste Your Money On this Item,"I purchased this product almost a year ago and it does not work as advertised. If your are only using it connected to your computer it's a good product, but I purchased it to copy my home movies. And if failed the test.The first problem is that it makes noise during playback, I sent it back to Sony to get it fixed and they sent it back saying there was nothing wrong with it. If you don't mind hearing a loud static every few seconds then by all means buy it.Another problem is the format if you are like me you will want to make you own personalized menu's, well you can't do it with this machine it seems to have it's own format that looks like DVD but when you try to get the movie files you get an error.I really thought this was going to be the perfect DVR but it's not, no way near it. By pass this product and find another."
1,LOOK before you leap,"On the positive side, it is an attractive unit.In the negative side, it will not directly record unless you use the ""+"" format. Unfortunately this is not compatible with many DVD players.In other words, buyer beware."
2,Poor Features......,"hi, i own this recorder. It takes only the ""+"" DVDs, while using it as a stand-alone, you cannot see what you are recording when you record from VHS or other tape player, because this thing does not have a any outputs for video or audio. Record settings are: 1 , 2 or 6 hours.When you want to use it as a DVD drive in the computer, the drivers are not windows-friendly, windows will not work properly in the near future, ( you will see a warning before instaling drivers).Does not have a Firewire output, just analog."
5,"A ""can't put down"" read!!","For anyone who has grown up playing or watching all sports like me- this is a MUST read. Whether you agree with Dog or not,you're on the phone all night with friends argueing the best sports debates of all-time. Being a high school basketball coach, this book will make my 3 hr bus trips & delays in airports be much more enjoyable. The discussions will last for hours.Dog- you put out a bible for sports buffs that not only has plenty of ""BARK"", but what a ""BITE"". Great job!! I'll be looking for your next read."
5,A must read for the true sports fan,"Chris Russo deliveres big time in his first attempt at writing a book. His knowledge and passion for all sports easily shines through. I learned many details that I never knew about some of the sporting worlds' most memorable moments. I also love the format of the book which allows you to browse and read in the order you would like. I have been stuck inside all memorial day weekend and Russo's work got me through it. All Mike & the Mad Dog fans must read this book. Non-listeners should run out and buy it as well. Way to go Mad Dog, not too bad for a Giant fan!"
3,...,"Of course, I would expect a book about sports ""arguments"" to show a little bias, but sometimes he gets a little ridiculous. I'll keep it simple with just one example: the Rangers & Islanders as hockey's greatest rivalry!?! Does he really expect anyone outside of New York to agree with him (or many hockey fans in New York like me, for that matter)? Habs and Leafs, I guess you can take your eight decades and nealy forty combined cups elsewhere...because apparently the greatest rivalry belongs to the worst of the Original 6 and an expansion team."
4,INTERESTING,"THIS BOOK IS ABOUT VARIOUS QUESTIONS AND OPINIONS CONCERNING THE WORLD OF SPORTS. ALOT OF SUBJECTS ARE COVERED, MANTLE VS MAYS, 56 GAME HITTING STREAK VS .406 BATTING AVERAGE AND BEST FEMALE TENNIS PLAYER. I AGREE AND DISAGREE WITH THE DOG, WHICH MAKES FOR MORE FUN. HE HAS ALOT OF GOOD IDEAS AND INSIGHTS. I RECOMMEND THIS FOR ALL SPORTS FANS WHO WOULD LIKE TO SEE CHANGES IN SPORTS AND DIFFERENT WAYS TO DECIDE WHO IS THE BEST."
2,Save Your Money,"As a long time listener of the Mike & The Mad Dog radio show, I was expecting more from the angry canine. Unfortunately this book is more like a weak single through the infield rather than a home run."
4,A Lunchbox/Bento Must-Have,"These cups transform any shallow plastic container into a great bento box. Use them to separate foods, or just to add color and make the lunchbox look more ""organized."" I have the square- and the heart-shaped cups and will get the triangles next. An assortment of sizes and colors gives you more options. You can also use these to make tiny quiches or casseroles to pack for lunch."
5,Excellent Product,"Forget the old ""water bath"" canners! This is an excellent product...quick and efficient with a handy guide for canning various foods!"
5,love this product!!!,I have used this product for years. Love it. Faster canning!! Am getting another because I can can more at the same time. What a time saver!!!Just wish the jar rack/holder was stainless steel!!cmm
4,Very useful,"I also can, and it was my first time to use this steamer this summer. My main reason to get it is to have a sterilizer while I use the BWB canner on another batch. If I was canning only one batch of high-acid foods, this would suffice, and it was indeed faster to process in this than in BWB. I would use a thermometer before I start timing the processing, at times I would even have to lower the heat setting as the temp was maintained anyway. Quite sturdy despite being lightweight. And since I don't have to wait to fill it with as much water as in BWB canner, it saved time in filling, heating the water, and re-boiling it for processing, and it remained light-weight! For its price, I already had a ROI for the abuse it got from me just from this past summer."
5,steam canner,"I love it. Wish I'd had it years ago. I will never use my big canner for fruits and jams again. Easy, clean, fast way to process food."
3,For the beginner not bad,"This is a nice alternative to water bath canning. I'm a beginner and wanted something less cumbersome. The included instructions aren't the best. Overall, for the price this is a great unit for the casual canner."
4,Just canned with steam canner for first time.,"I just bought this canner and used it to can tomatoes for the first time. It was easy to use, it just took a while for the water to come to a boil I suspect because I have a flat top stove. When the steam appeared in a steady stream I left it on the high setting in order to insure the steam was suffienct for the entire 45 minutes. It worked and I used the cold canning method as instructed in the manual. This made the process better for me since getting everything out of a boiling water bath canner can be so dangerous. I intend to use it for high acid vegetables and fruits or anything that uses vinegar as the acid."
3,canner,Canner was not a large as imagined it would be and not as sturdy. But it will work for a beginner canner.
2,Does what it says it does but.....,"As a new canner, I did some research....apparently I didn't do enough. The USDA does not recommend steam canners because there is not enough research done into the safety of steam canning. There are several people who do do steam canners and do swear by them. I ended up buying a Boiling Water Bath canner instead because all canning recipes reference BWB canners. It's ok though, I use this pot for other things that I can sterilize with steam."
1,Doesn't work,Apparently this item will not work on glass top stoves. That is an important piece of information that is not conveyed to the consumer. I am in the process of trying to get my money back.
1,disappointed,I just received my Back to basics home steam canner and am sad to report after being on the burner on high for over an hour it still never came to a boil. So if you have a glass top stove you can NOT use this canner. The bottom on the canner is not flat so it will not work.
5,Better than the first one,"This is the second steam canner that we have purchased. The first one lasted 20+ years, and we would probably still be using it if we hadn't let it boil dry. We like the grate on which the bottles sit on the new one, and the top fits down further to provide a better seal. Hope we get 20+ years out of this one."
5,Makes Canning Fun Again!,I had read about this in a forum and then came here and read all the reviews and immediately purchased it! This truly makes canning season SO much easier! No steamy overheated kitchen and NO heavy lifting! Mixing quarts and pints? Put qts in first and add pint after so they all come out at once..easy peasy! My only regret is not having found this sooner! My sister borrowed it and ordered hers' the next day! Buy one...you'll love it!
5,Just how I imagined!,"I purchased this as a gift, and was tempted to order another for myself. It is substantial and looks great!"
2,Didn't care for it.,"I bought this book 3 years ago and never read it. I finally picked it up and was disapointed. What could have been a great book ends up being a drawn out story. The middle DRAGS after what is a poorly constructed back-story. I found ity dry and lacking any ""pull"" to be read. And it seems as if everythibng is being put through a relgious filter. I honestly think it nearly qualifies as relgious fiction, and i felt a little mislead by the jacket."
3,Get it if you have to...,I didn't care for this one too much. It provides the info you need but is dry even by science book standards... There's probably more fun ways to learn cell biology.
4,Great,"Love this mattress topper! This is my third one. Loved the first one so much I bought one for our camper, and just bought one for our granddaughter. Highly recommend it!"
1,poor quality,"I have had this product for a very short time and there is NO memory left. Just a big sag like a cheap mattress. So it has a ""guarantee?"" I am unable to mail this back, so what is the point? Save your money. This is a rip off."
4,"3"" foam topper pad","The delivery time was excellent, and the price was reasonable. My only complaint is that the product came not wrapped in the factory wrapping. The foam had already breathed and expanded and was forced into a plastic wrap. This made it bulky to transport, but when opened, it turned out fine."
5,It is actually good,"I am always suspicious of anything with excellent claims. I was pleasently surprised with this product. The support for all points on the body is excellent. 3 inches is plenty of cusion for this. It breathes well and does not radiate body heat to make you sweat.I no longer have the aches and sore places while in bed or when I wake up. While this is not a magic cure for insomnia, you will indeed be pleased with this. I have found that it works best when you flip or rotate this once a month."
3,seat cover,"The seat cover fits ok, but the stitching doesn't seem to be holding together ver good after only 2-3 weeks of wear. Hope it lasts at least a year or so."
2,Happy but not totally,"I am pleased with the ordering, email confirmation process, and delivery of this product but not totally happy with the seat covers. The seat seam stitching is already starting to stretch which will lead to eventually separating. I have had similar seat covers in the past that lasted 3 years without this problem. What is the warranty and replacement guarantee for this product."
1,"Perfect, until it fell apart...","I was so excited to receive this product. Enjoyed it, BUT only a month later, it tore and practically fell apart! What a disappointment!!!"
2,Bored my daughter silly!,My daughter is five and in a French immersion school. I bought this DVD in the hope that it would reinforce what she hears at school since I can't. She barely paid attention. My recommendation is that you go to Amazon Canada and check out the Caillou and Kirikou dvds. She LOVES those!
2,Not What I Expected,"I was disappointed in this for a couple of reasons, all personal preference. I thought that the genuine leather would be softer/more pliable, but this was hard and not very ""bend-y"". I know, being new, it isn't broken in, but my bonded leather feels better than this. There's not much margin space for notes, nor is there much space between lines for underlining. It just seems very cluttered. I don't like the next book to start on the same page as the last ends. And, like all the others say, the type is quite small. I knew this when I ordered it from reading the other reviews, and this isn't that big of a deal to me, but it is misleading. Compared to the normal print in Bibles, I suppose it would be largER, but I don't consider it a large print Bible. For the price you pay, it's not bad. But it's not what I wanted/expected, and not something I will use long term. I'm sending it back and going for a more expensive Bible that suits my needs."
5,Easy read Bible,"This is thin, easy to read and a great Bible. I bought it for a new believer and he loves it."
4,Great Bible,I wanted a Bible that I could read and that it wasn't so big it was cumbersome. This is the perfect size and I have no trouble reading it. Get one if you don't have one. It can change your life!
2,Pages are see-through,"I didn't like this particular Bible because the pages were very see-through, so you could see through the back page of words....this was very distracting and difficult to read....also some of Christs letters in red were faint on many texts. I was disappointed that the publishers made such basic and fundamental errors for the most important Book in the world."
4,Affordable quality HD,The price on this unit was outstanding and the quality of the HD images are inpresive.I do recomend you chose the recomended screen for this projector it makes all the diffrence in obtaining the best picture.
5,Great Sing Along,I used to listen to this while I worked at the Disneyland Hotel. Anyone with a Disney fetish will love this video.
5,Brand new book - great price.,I was happy to be able to get this as a gift for a friend. Thank you very much. The book was well researched.
5,I loved this book. Can't stop thinking about it!,This book is incredible. I just loved learning about the arctic ice and the Karluk. The hardship these men go through is incredible. The author is great at character building and you begin to feel like you know these men. Really a great read.
1,Can't finish it... innacurate information.,"I love polar exploration literature. But when I read on page 58 that the men aboard the Karluk were disheartened by the story of George Washington DeLong's expedition in 1879, and how the crew of the Jeannette had all perished (all 13 of them!!!) Anyone who knows their polar exploration literature knows very well that quite a few of the Jeannette's crew actually survived in one of the most amazing ""triumph of the human spirit"" stories in polar history. The entire world was shocked when they turned up alive in Siberia well after they'd been given up for dead. To misrepresent this story of survival as a doomed expedition from which no one survived as a way to explain the mounting dread in the Karluk's men ruined this book for me. What else escaped the fact-checkers? I am stopping at page 60, and picking up a copy of ""The Log of Bob Bartlett"" instead. Also, how can you have a book on arctic exploration without a map of the ship's route!???!"
2,Surprisingly Boring,"The Ice Master starts off to be very interesting when Jennifer Niven talks of their expedition but in the middle of the book of she writes about the hardships the crew went through it got boring. She kept on writing about the same hardships over and over. For example, she writes constintly about how cold they were. I knew that the first few times she wrote about it. Every new chapter I began to read just sounded like the one I just finished.I could not finish the book. If you want to read about an artic expedition I do not suggest this book."
2,Poorly written,"Coincidentally I had just finished 'Alive' - another story about cold weather survival. Perhaps mainly by contrast I found it impossible to get into 'The Ice Master'. While the event is undeniably interesting, Niven's telling ruins it."
4,Another in the Fine Line of Boy's Own Arctic Adventure,"Jennifer Niven in The Ice Master (The Doomed 1913 Voyage of the Karluk) has plucked from history another wonderful adventure story in the ice and snow. This one was a little harder to bear than some of the others as so very many of the personalities were selfish and cruel. That was probably, though, what made this book a little different from the rest of the (ice) pack and all the more horrific. These experiences brought out a person's true character and it wasn't pretty much of the time, starting early when their captain deserted them. There were also a few instances of heroics and true compassion. This is a fine addition to the Arctic and Antartic literature sprouting like weeds throughout the history section of book stores. If these stories have become your addiction, you do not want to miss this one."
5,The Real survivor's island!,"In an interesting recent tradition of great non-fiction adventure books like, Into Thin Air, Perfect Storm, A First Rate Tragedy, and the recent In the Heart of the Sea, we now have what might be the best of the breed, The Ice Master. Jennifer Niven has mastered her subject as the reader is an active participant along with these survivors. Despite the reader knowing from page one that the ship sinks and some survive you are drawn in by a narative that is both personal and clearly detailed with historical perspective. Ms. Niven brought forth a very well written book which is fresh and exciting and shocking page after page turning page. I can't really express how much I recommend you take a trip to the Arctic on the Karluk."
4,"Another great Artic adventure, on par with ""South""","For me ""South"", is the classic Polar expedition tragedy book. This book is on par with it. However in any second source history book, there are sometimes some niggling details that are wrong. The fact that another ""doomed"" expedition had some survivers, may not have been known to the crew on this one. But its not clear that is what happened. Now I want to go find that book and read it. But had you only read the original books & sources you would have come away with a completely different perspective. Ms. Niven got to the heart of the trip and who were really the heros here and who were the cads.But, this is more than just a man triumphs over nature book. Some of these folks survived but it wasn't great. It was a good read though and I'm glad I picked it up. I'm going after Ms. Niven's other book ""Ada"" next."
5,indispensável.,esqueamos um pouco essa cultura eurocentrada. olhemos além.as coisas mais próximas da terra.
5,Great for everything!,"I use this on everything now - beef, pork, chicken, turkey, etc. Haven't tried it on fish. I wouldn't use it on sirloin, but I don't buy sirloin anymore. A little work with this thing would make a chuck steak eat like a sirloin.I got it to soften up some top round steaks, and they came out like tenderloin (without all the fat, which I'm not supposed to eat, which is why I buy round). It makes it tender and moist without changing the shape, although it will flatten a chicken breast a little, which is not all bad.I got the single-row model. I would probably recommend the 48-blade 3-row model for a family."
5,Excellent tool!,"My son in law likes to marinate meats prior to grilling. He always stabbed the meat with a knife first, so I bought this tool for him, and one for myself also. He really enjoys the ease with which it pierces and tenderizes the meat. My daughter also remarked how easy it is to use. I especially like that it tenderizes the meat without smashing it into a thin flat wafer, so thick steaks can be tenderized, but still be cooked to the desired doneness. If doing very thick meat, I found it easier to press the tool only half way into the meat on one side, then turn the meat over and do the same again on the other side, instead of trying to push the ""needles"" all the way through to the cutting board. Cleaning is easy. A fast rinse under hot water, then into the dishwasher.A WORD OF CAUTION: We nicknamed this tool ""the shark"", because the needles are exceedingly sharp...like shark's teeth."
5,Like magic!,"This really tenderizes meat well. I had to stop using sprinkle on meat tenderizer because of the sodium content. I was a little hesitant when I ordered the 48 Blade Meat Tenderizer, but was very pleased to find out that it really tenderizes! Clean up is also great...I just soak it until I'm ready to put it in the dishwasher. It cleans up perfectly, no rust, no fuss, no problems!"
5,"""Recession"" buster!","I saw Alton Brown and Emeril using a Jaccard Meat Tenderizer on their shows so did some research and decided on the Deni 48 blade meat tenderizer since it is a trusted brand name, it got rave reviews and of course, it was a lower price but the same quality. I entitled my review ""Recession"" buster since I can now buy a chuck roast, slice it length wise, then into steak portions and use my new Deni and voila! I have a perfect steak for grilling which is a fraction of the price of other steaks. I have purchased a lot of kitchen gadgets in my lifetime (most wound up in a garage sale) but this is a must have for any kitchen!"
5,Great item!,"I never thought using this would make the difference it did. Venison, chicken, steak, pork- USE IT -, it will make you wonder how you lived without this tenderizer in your kitchen. Clean up is easy: I will never be without one again."
5,Excellent Service. Excellent Product,Firstly let me comment on the superb service provided by Amazon. I purchased the Deni MT 48 on line on Saturday 6th of December. The order was confirmed on Sunday and I received the product on Wednesday.I was a bit sceptical on how effective the Deni MT 48 would be in tenderizing and aiding the soaking up of the marinade but having used it a number of times I am absolutely satisfied with the results.
1,"Yes, it works but...","I bought this about 7 months ago for my husband because he is a grilling fanatic. He wanted the ultimate meat tenderizer and I saw Alton Brown from Good Eats using one simmilar to this. To say the least I bought it and the hubby was happy...for a while.Yes, it does tenderize the meat and makes even the toughest cuts very succulent. The problem is after 7 months of use it is falling apart. Two of the three screws that holds this product together has disappeared in the dishwasher. It is suppose to be dishwasher safe, remember that. I'm not giving up on the concept of this meat tenderizer, I just won't buy another one from Deni."
5,STICK WITH IT !,"Love it ! It transformed my normally chewey pork steaks into tender melt-in-your mouth flavor-bombs. I did use a mojo-criollo marinade. It can however be a little tiring and maybe in the future someone will rig an electric stapler-type mechanism to reduce the effort but until that happens, it's still worth the effort in small doses."
5,WoW!,I can't belive how great this product works. If it ever broke I would replace it at twice the cost!! No one I mean NO ONE! Makes a better chicken fried steak then me now! :O) You must buy this NOW... Not later or it will double in cost.YOU Must buy this!! I bought 6 dollars in chuck/round steak. And made 10 big chicken fried steaks you could cut with a fork!! One of the best buys I have ever made @ amazon! You give me the toughest meat you can find and I will make it cut and taste like Prime rib! No kidding and it will not turn meat into hamburger.
4,works well,Does a good job however a little difficult to clean.Should be cleaned thoroughly when used with raw meat I used the Dishwasher to clean. Hope it does no harm to spring or blades. Did not say in instructions.
5,Excellent Product,"I purchased the Deni 48 blade meat tenderizer about three years ago and am so glad I did. The product does an excellent job of tenderizing even the toughest cuts of meat rendering them tender and succulent. An added bonus is that the piercing promotes the absorption of flavorings, marinades, brine solutions and tenderizer should you wish to use it also. The unit is sturdily made and has been through the dishwasher many times without any problems. I do recommend setting it in a dish drainer for several hours after a dishwasher run to really dry it thoroughly. Shaking will let you know if it is dry enough to be recapped and stored. I have also given several of these as gifts and the recipients have all been delighted with its performance."
5,LOVE TO THE MAX,One of the most useful items in my kitchen. My neighbor borrowed this so much i bought her one too! It is just so much better than that stupid mallet everyone thinks is great for tenderizing.
4,Tough Tool For Tender Temptations,"This is one great kitchen tool for tenderizing steaks and chops. Heavy-duty plastic shell covering 48 super-sharp blades to make quick work of a ""tough"" task. The Deni MT48 works best on fully thawed meat. If the meat is too frozen, you risk not being able to pierce the meat and possibly damaging the tenderizer. Be sure to place the meat on a cutting board and then just place the MT48 over the steak or chop and press down. Cover the whole surface of the meat, flip and repeat on the other side. The MT48 works great and is well constructed."
1,It's in the trash,"I enjoy professional strength tools. Things that can get the job done. After bending 3 blades and having countless problems using this device, it's now in the trash. You have to be very slow and delicate to make it work - very slow and very delicate."
3,Looking for a metamorphosis,"I listened to this album twice while driving in the Nevada wilderness. Nathan Lane is always a charming person to spend some time with, even if he's just a voice coming out of my CD player. The problems the critics identified in the Lincoln Center production are vaguely apparent on the recording: With the exception of ""Shaw"" and ""Ariadne,"" the songs sound like Sondheim using half his considerable brain -- the songs are clever, but they're not tied to the passions or thoughts of complex characters. The final song really is a letdown -- it's a call to action, but to do what? And the humor presented in the dialogue is pretty routine. Still, you should by this if you're either a Sondheim or a Broadway score completist, and there are several minor rewards."
2,Just Because It's Sondheim...,"...doesn't mean it deserves 5 stars. Or even 4. It was Sondheim's first score and it shows. Other than one or two cute numbers, it is barely listenable. While the show may have been improved since it's original 1974 production at Yale, it just doesn't come together. I think it is a lovely academic excercise, but it is too anaesthetic and lopsided to serve as anything other than an academic excercise. Sondheim enthusiasts will no doubt rate it highly as they do anything he writes, but objectively, this recording exists solely to satiate showtune collectors."
3,Printer Stand,When I reviewed this item on the Amazon website prior to purchasing the printer cabinet there was nothing in the description stating some of the parts of the cabinet were made of metal. Upon receipt of the item I was really disappoiinted to find that the shelves and back of the cabinet were indeed made of metal. If I wouldn't have really needed the cabinet so urgently I would have returned it...
4,"Love my new alarm, but hated learning to use it","I bought this alarm clock because I'm too cheap to get the grown up version. I like everything about it except it took me more than a couple days to get used to programing it. Once I figured it all out though, it has been easy and great to wake up to sunshine very morning."
4,A definite standout among gay male novels.,"After reading my fill of whiny novels about lonely, sexually-obsessed gay men, I was wary of Nightswimmer. This novel surprised me. It has an emotional intensity that really draws the reader in."
4,very spellbinding novel about gay men's affairs,"I particularly enjoyed reading this book which deals with a love affair between two gay men,who cannot truly love because their past affairs are too obsessive and devastating. Every gay man has recognized what he is certainly living or what he's experienced : the search for a true love."
3,Kind of entertaining but certainly not great,"I don't understand the rave reviews for this book. The story is thin and fairly predictable, the characters are not very well-developed, and the writing alternates between pedestrian and ridiculously awful. It's fun if you live in NYC or want to reminisce about NYC gay life in the 90s but this is no great work of literature."
2,Nope,"Starts out strong, then it falls completely apart. Hey, who can say what makes a book work for anyone (other reviewers here obviously liked this one), but it sure didn't work for me. I thought it was an absolute mess."
1,"Oh, no, not again","Yet another gay fantasia, centered on how much great sex the author/persona/narrator ""gets,"" Nightswimmer traffics in every silly sterotype about gay men that the dominant, straight culture has shoved rather unlovingly down our gay throats. Ah, yes, we are obsessed with sex. Ah, yes, we are interesting when we are bleedingly tragic. Ah, yes, our wit is just ever so quick. And best of all, we can whine like no one else. But perhaps worst of all, it's so disheatening to find the stereotypes aped and pandered by those in the gay community. But then it's predictable, since Olshan has been taught well by Felice Picano and his crew of Fire Island hacks"
1,A waste of paper and ink,"Reading this nonsense, at least the 50 or so pages I could endure, was a little like spending an hour with a fourth rate psychologist intent on telling you about their own unintersting drama-obsessed life. Even if all you want are immature life insights, you'll be disappointed. Most 12 year olds could do better."
5,"""Nightswimmer"" All Aglow","While I had read mostly decent reviews of ""Nightswimmer"", I went into this book with a bit of skepticism. So often, gay-themed novels barely qualify as true literature. Thankfully, Joseph Olshan is a first-class author who takes this multi-dimentional story and enhances it with a very unique perspective--written almost as an extended, detailed love letter. It is refreshing to find a book about mature men who question and struggle with love, passion, relationships, commitment, and the role personal history plays in each one's future. A definite read for anyone looking for a quality story about love and loss that just happens to feature gay men."
2,"Okay, sure.","I was really looking forward to reading this book, just because I'm rather fond of drama novels and the like. But, to be honest, I think I got my hopes a bit too high. While at first, I was completely drawn in by the story, style of writing, complexity of characters, etc. I was a bit disappointed by the end.In the beginning, Nightswimmer was strong, it had many different elements and was rather realistic. However, it kept going on, and it got rather repetitive in my mind, and pretty... bland? Along with it, I got lost a few times with mentions of random people and places. I just didn't like it. As a previous reviewer stated, the only reason I read it was because it kept me reading on. It kept me hooked, but not necessarily interest. I was more interested in getting it over with, or looking forward to it improving in the end. It didn't happen, though. Not for me."
2,Not to good,This album is not all that great. It sounds alot like alot of stuff Wierd All Yankovich might have made as a parody. It is course sounding and seems unfinished. It only has 6 songs so you get very little for what you pay. The only decent song is the last one and most of that one was done with the help of many more talented artists. Unless you corny Music i cannot recomend this Album (if you can call a cd with six xongs an album) LISTEN TO BEFORE YOU BUY!!
3,"you gets no ""sweet dreams""","Tracks 1,3,& 5 all sample heavily from ""Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)"" by the Eurythimcs from the 80s. It sort of works, but the album mix is much better.I am still looking for the original radio mix that was released before the album that contained all of Faith's rap at the bridge of the song. (Before the reworked it and put a small part of it at the beginning and added Diddy & Loon at the bridge) Anyone know if they released that version?"
3,"Tip works fine, but is a little expensive","This tip is like the original that comes in the cleaning kits but it costs almost half as much as the entire original kit. It works fine, but I think it should sell for a lot less."
4,Surprised,Received item earlier than advised and was quite surprised that it had been a previously used item. Book was exactly what I was looking for but did not appreciate receiving a previously used item without being forewarned.
4,An insightful wake up call.,"This book was a book that I not only enjoyed reading, but it helped me to gain perspective on many things that I was unaware of, or ignoring. I'm not usually one to read a book for hours on end, and usually end up stopping and starting quite often, but I wasn't inclined to do so while reading this particular book in my spare time. I found it very interesting and it made me think of things I had never considered in myself before. A great tool for self discovery, and improvement without a lot of psycho babble."
4,the ideal problem solver,this book was recomended through a testing group. hoping it will help me pass the test and improving my thinking skills.
1,Faded songs ruin ANY album....,"Hello, the sound quality is good, the song selection is good, & the songs are not too long, however, TWO songs fade out! Faded out songs on ANY album studio or live are demotivating & diseffective, & the edit/fade effect/affect throughout this album negate the positive about it........"
5,SOMEDAY!! Maybe They Will ReUnite And We Can Dance Again!,"My Oh My... The First 3 Albums From This Fantastic Band Are All Imports Now.. :) Whoa.. From Seeing All Of Thier Concerts Here In Toronto, And Remembering Those Very special Nights, Well Can't Be Expressed In Words.. This CD Was The Start Of A Great Line ""Or Should I Say Thin Line"" Since There Is Only 3 Cd's And A Greatest Hits Collection.. Every One Of Them Are Great From start To Finish! Highly Recommended!! Also Check Out Alan Frews' Solo Cd ""Hold On"".."
5,THE 80'S ROCK!!!!!!,I GREW UP IN THE 80'S AND WITH THE OUTFIELD AND GLASS TIGER AND TIFFANY AND TAPAU AND BRYAN ADAMS AND ALL THE OTHER GREATEST 80'S ROCK BANDS. I WAS OUT OF TRACK I GUESS YOU COULD CALL IT I ENJOY ALL KINDS OF MUSIC NOW THAT I AM IN MY EARLY 30'S. I WAS ALWAYS LOOKING FOR THE MUISC IN THE STORES BUT I COULD NEVER FIND IT. SO I AM GLAD I LOOKED HERE NOW I CAN REMINSE OLD TIMES AND ENJOY THE MUSIC I STILL LOVE TIL THIS DAY. SO ROCK ON AND KEEP THEM OLDIES COMING AND NEVER PUTTING THEM IN A VAULT.ROCKER OF THE 80'S KIM!!!!!!!!!
3,Nice looking,"For a plain kitchen, works fine. For a nicer, fancier kitchen, don't bother, it would look cheap."
5,Unbelievably Good,"The CD contains a number of outstanding tracks of piano genius Art Tatum. Especially the last four tracks, compositions of Tatum himself, are very good. Ain't Misbehavin' (track 5) shows the extraordinary technical abilities of Tatum. Shockingly good. I have never heard someone playing like that."
4,Wrong Photo. Good Product.,"Royal Jelly can work miracles if taken on a regular basis. In my experience, the pure or honey-based products are much better than any pill form. However, please note that this item is a tiny jar of pure royal jelly, not honey-based royal jelly at all. Don't be misled by the photo that appears in Amazon."
2,Rubbish,One of the most important things an embedded assembly programmer coming into C needs to know is how to set up absolute memory addressing without resorting to compiler-specific features or assembly language. This book resorts to compiler-specific #pragma directives to fit its chosen chip and OS. The fact that we might want to use _no_ OS and a non-Bytecraft compiler is not something that seems to have crossed the author's mind. Much better to shell out the extra ten bucks for Ted Van Sickle's _Programming Microcontrollers in C_. That one is Motorola-oriented but at least has the common decency to explain how to set up ports and peripherals within the ANSI C language proper.
2,Limited Usefulness,"""C Programming for Embedded Systems"" promised to be an extremely useful book for those interested in embedded systems however, its scope is so limited that it proves to be close to useless. If you want a very basic introduction to programming motorolas simplest embedded processors then this book is for you. For the rest of us however, the amount of useful material relevant to all chips is probably about 30 pages and if you don't know the material covered here, you probably shouldn't be wanting to program embedded systems.For a better book, buy a book on PIC assembler, it will prove to be much more useful in the long run. The best method to start programming embedded systems: look for projects and documentation on the internet. Your time will be much better spect there than with this book."
2,Basic Book,"This book lacked any real depth in embedded systems,I was disappointed, I have used byte craft's compilerfor the cop processor and found the manual very helpful,though this book I suggest is only suitable as quickreference."
2,Compiler-Specific,"Though the author's heart is surely in the right place, this book suffers from an over-simplification of the problem. Writing embedded software is not easy. A big part of the complexity is that every development environment (specific combination of cross compiler, debugging tools, target processor, etc.) is unique. By focusing the content of this book only on the cross compiler produced by his employer (ByteCraft), any generality is lost. The result is a book that's good as a user's manual for those using the ByteCraft compiler but not so good for others."
5,Zurell's a Hit,"More than just helpful, I found the book grippingly interesting. I'm counting down the days until we get a novel from this fellow."
3,"Great quality, but the photo was decieving","Being the idiot I am, i did no look at the specifications before i bought the product. I suggest this to smaller children."
4,Wow,"Well i didn't read the mini part didn't expect it to be mini, but its okay :) its nice to just keep a smooth beat."
1,Fits in the palm of your hand! LITTLE,"THIS IS NOT WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR, THEY ARE SO LITTLE ITS NOT FUNNY!SORRY ITS ON THE WAY BACK TO AMAZON.COM"
2,"they're ok, wouldn't buy again","purchased these for a 7 year olds birthday, and given the chance, i wouldn't do it again. the top of the drums look like a soft cloth or leather, after getting them in, i see that they're more like hard plastic, not at all soft and they're VERY small. i wasn't impressed with them. for the money, i feel could have gotten a much better present"
5,Really small...,"I mean really small which musicians would probably expect. If you're buying for a child, they are really small like baby size."
2,"They weren't kidding when they said ""mini""","Wow, these bongos are the smallest bongos I've ever seen. They are too small for my 2 year old to play. I have trouble understanding who these were made for since they are just ridiculously small and not really useable as an instrument."
5,"Well made, nice sound","Our little musician has been playing with these since age two, and everyone else loves them too. Nice, honest sound for a toy! I was impressed."
4,Nice set,"This set is nice for a novice or beginner. Would make a great addition for a classroom or stage musician. Not the best sounding set out there, but for the price they are real wood and sound just fine."
4,Small drums,"Make sure to look at the measurements of this item, these drums are really small...much smaller than I expected, I somehow missed the ""mini"" in the title. However my husband says they sound nice and are priced right."
3,Bongos for Grand Daughter,Great quality construction but I'd recommend getting the standard larger size. The size was too small to make good rich sound.
4,"well made, looks differ, very small","the bongos sound great right from the box. they are ready to play and seem like really good quality especially for a small child. they don't look quit as nice as the one you see in the picture, the wood looks different. but they play well and my 3 year old son really like them so far. would have easily been 5 stars but i don't like false advertising. you should get exactly what you pay for. in this case it's cosmetic, but it's the principle."
1,Awful,WAY smaller than they appear to be in the picture. Not to mention they sound horrible. Might as well turn two bowls upside down on the table and tap on those. Sending these back immediately.
2,Save your time and money,"Some suspect lines, and skimpy on citations. Redundant of such larger volumes as Moriarty, Cockayne, Isenburg, Turton, Redlich, and Weis, and probably not worth the high price."
1,Too Much Time Spent Defending. Not for the beginner,"I have been a Wade fan for a number of years, and have read most of his books. This one pales in comparision. In almost every chapter, Wade goes off on a tangent about why he is always been attacked by critics, and how unfair they are too him. On EVERY page, he also included famous quotes on what makes men great - this is VERY distracting. Next time Wade should stick to the facts. Also, this book is not for the beginner as some earlier reveiwers have noted. When it comes to the basic option info you need - Wade refers you to go read certain chapters in his other books."
4,Probably the best he's written,"I have to say I enjoyed this one. Quite a bit in there about lowering your risk(i.e. in the money covered calls, spreads, etc), which seems to me to be the main feature behind any good investment program. Wish he had put in a bit more about technical analysis though."
1,don't do it,I really enjoy Dave Matthews and that is why I was really disappointed to see that there isn't a single Dave Matthews tune on the DVD. What a waste! I'd sell this in a heartbeat!
2,DMB-Crowded Streets Superstars,"I have found out that usually if something is ""unauthorized"" it's probably best to steer clear of it. I only gave this item 2 stars because #1 I wasn't impressed by the dvd, and #2 I was shocked to find out that this dvd is the same as the one I purchased on the same day. Am I the last one to know that ""Dave Matthews Band Plugging the Gap"", and ""Dave Matthews Band Crowded Streets Superstars"" are one and the same!!!"
5,Loved it!!!,"I loved this movie, maybe in part because I'm celebrating my 25th anniversary this week and this movie reveals a truth that many who throw in the towel never get to appreciate. Love, real true love can conquer all. Our story isn't the same as this one, but we've ended up in the same place, together. So many could learn a lesson from this movie if they would but hear it."
4,Actually pretty good,"It's not exactly North by Northwest, but this is a solid, fun film. Unlike most romantic comedies, the writing is actually pretty good. There were a bunch of really clever lines, and no real groaners that I can think of.Two things bothered me about it. It really celebrates the concept of heterosexual marriage and monogamy as the way to go. It doesn't really question any of that. Lots of people are happy not being married, or being non-monogamous, and certainly not everyone is straight. So it's a little bit of a bummer, Yet-Another-Movie-About-Straight-White-People-Getting-Married-And-Being-Monogamous. Like we really need another one of those.And also, somewhat it sets up the wife as the villain for a lot of the movie, which is another sad trope. Poor-Perfect-Man-With-Overreactive-Wife is a little played out as a movie theme.Other than those two things, I enjoyed it quite a bit though."
1,Terrible movie,"The wife cheats on the guy, throws him out of the house (without even talking to him) because of a misunderstanding, and let's him think he's raising his kid (she's not his), but in the end, he goes back to his wife because he's in love. What a bunch of garbage. This movie panders to the Oprah crowd."
1,Spare yourself the pain,"Having loved Ryan Reynolds in ""The Nines"", I took a chance on this movie. WRONG! It is a terrible mess, lurching all over the place in both tone and narrative. And a wrap around wedding scenario, that bookends the main story, does not help, seemingly put there in a lumbering attempt to make some sort of thematic sense of the ""chaos"" of the central tale. And to perhaps pad out the screen time. Take off this wedding framing device and the end credits and you have a pointless 75 minute tale about unlikeable people doing unlikeable things to no real end. I urge you to save you money and yourself (from this inept effort)."
1,I Love Lucy,"If you liked the tv shows ""Married With Children"" or ""King Of Queens"" you'll probably like this moronofest but if your IQ is over 100 then skip this 90 minute episode of ""I Love Lucy"". The whole thing hinges on events that NO ONE would do - leaving your name, address and phone number at the hospital when dropping of a stranger for example. Then there's the fight with his wife which could have been resolved in 30 seconds if he would have made any attempt at all to explain instead he ends up living in a dive motel. Yeah, that would happen. All the ""humor"" in this is telegraphed way ahead of time and the insipid sound track makes you fast forward through the ""touching reflective moments"". I had my finger on the ""stop"" button at 30 minutes into this. I went the distance but wish I hadn't. This sucked."
1,not funny,This was listed as a comedy but it was not funny at all the best part of the movie was the credits
5,Made Me Appreciate Ryan Reynolds,"I've never really liked any of Ryna Reynolds' work just because it has been very immature and doesn't really show his talent, but this movie definitely brought out the best in him.The movie itself is a great story that brings out a lot of emotion in you. I would highly recommend you buy it, especially since it is so cheap now."
3,Adventurous,"Thom Gunn's poetry is marvelously crafted and filled with intriguing imagery. His series of poems about Jeffrey Dahmer is rather thought-provoking. For me, his poetry doesn't have an emotional impact, but rather a mental one. I prefer fiery poems, that rattle my brain and shake my worldview. Gunn achieves that in some poems, but not all in this collection. I can see why he's highly acclaimed, though. It's just not my taste."
2,a weak collection,"i know gunn is a good poet, i've read many poems he has written that i like. but this collection is weaker than gunn's usual work. the book does get stronger as it goes on, making section three the strongest of the three sections."
1,don't be deceived,"Don't be deceived. This cd does not include a bonus DVD (as described). I don't understand how an error like this occurs-the jewel case is not designed for an additional disc. The music is very good, like all of Hiromi's music. I give the music itself 4 stars."
2,"Juvenile, oh so juvenile","I know tastes differ, but I'm having a hard time understanding the high praise others have given this series. Based on those positive reviews, I purchased the set, but am so very dissappointed. With almost no real plot or character development, every episode seems to have only one purpose -- fanservice for adolescent boys into really large breasts. The only reason I gave it two stars rather than one is because, bad as this series is, there are worse out there, and I wanted to distinquish between bad and really bad. Not recommended."
4,hoodwinked at the mall Kiosk,"I was first introduced to this product at a mall where I spent the most ridiculous amount of money for it that I am embarassed just thinking about it. I was elated to find it online at Amazon for an affordable price. I find the product really, really works and I would recommend it."
2,Premier Anti Age Cream by Dead Sea Premier,i don't like it It's nothing like the cream I previously bought.It's like trying to sread wax on my face.I have used this product for 2 years
4,great album but not quite Silk & Steel which I NEED!,Just a quickie to all you Giuffria fans ... I simply MUST get a CD copy of Silk & Steel ... do you want to sell? cheers Murray
2,Gets warm quickly,"I'm a dogwalker, so some days I'm pounding the pavement in the blazing sun for 4 hours at a time. I'm usually not bothered by it, but Southern California recently had stretches of record breaking heat that nearly took me out. I thought this product would help, but it did so only minimally. When you first put it on, it's wet and uncomfortable (because you've just taken it out of water), even after wringing out the ends a bit. However, 10 mins into a walk, the bandana would be hot. I kept several in a container of water in a cooler in my car so I'd have a fresh one for my next walk, but that's a lot of bother for something that would be hot within a few minutes anyway.Chanda DavetasLike You Never Left! pet sittingPasadena, CA"
1,Not very long lasting...,"These headbands are a great idea however they do not last long for people who work outside in the deep south where Im from. I got them for my boyfriend, who is in construction, and he said they start out great but the coolness wears off and the headband doesnt work as well after several uses. I think they would be good for kids playing sports outside, or hot events that dont last more than a few hours."
4,fills a need,"I ordered these for the service techs and the folks that work outside for other reasons in the dealership where I work. We live in Georgia and the hot weather is on it's way. These aren't perfect, but they are much better than nothing. We'll put a bunch of them in a cooler w/ ice cold water early in the morning and they'll be feeling good when the heat bares down in the early afternoon. We've bought them from a retail store in the past and were glad to save on them from Amazon this year."
5,A great video!,"I've had Asterix and Caesar for a while now, (recently I've lost it, however) and it is a great movie! The plot is good, and the animation is terrific!"
1,waste of money,the size charts shown are completely wrong. i order size 6 and the panties were big enough to fit my over weight aunt. it's ridiculous i had to give them to her. on top of that the quality is so poor.
4,book,I purchased this book as a gift for someone else but I did have a chance to review it. It has all the information that you might want in it.
3,Nice pictures,Nice pictures. I was hoping for more historical information on the story of the stars.
4,Graphic SF Reader,"The beginning of the story of the continuing misadventures of Dog, and his farmer Wal Footrot. Not to mention a cat called Horse, a magpie called Pew, and a few scruffy relatives.Add in a girlfriend, the local rugby team, and some dodgy neighbours, and plenty of amusing times to be had."
2,Disapointing,"When I heard that T.A. Baron was writting another book I was thrilled. I really enjoyed the Lost Years of Merlin series and was looking forward to another great read. However, I found this book to be poorly written. The diction was lacking and it sounded as if she made the names of the chracters up by scrambling as many letters as she could to make something that resembled a name. The story had a good plot though, and with some hard work could have been better."
3,"Convoluted, intriguing, and mysterious","This is the first book I have read by this author. It took me a while to truly get into this book. I am glad I stuck with it. The story really takes off once the characters begin to meet up with each other. The mystery of Merlin's true heir and the child of the dark prophecy truly intrigued me. Found myself trying to figure it out. You think you have it all figured out and then Barron throws something in that makes you rethink what you thought you had already figured out.I am looking forword the next book in the series.Would give it a 3.5 if I could.With that said, I thought the language at times was inappropriate. I would not want my 10 year old to read it do to the profane language. I feel the story was not improved by the language and would have been just as good without it.Still a good tale of Avalon with new ideas."
2,Disappointing,"This is an earnest if clumsily written book about redemption and believing in yourself. The dialogue is wooden and the characters are completely one dimensional. The author is trying to make a statement about caring for the environment, but it just ends up to be preachy and pedantic. There are far better young adult fantasy series on the market, and I would not recommend this one."
1,VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN-not appropriate for intended age group,"Unfortunately, I was unable to get past the first chapter because I was so disgusted and angered by the intensely obscene violent reference toward the very first female character introduced in the book. This reference was highly INNAPROPRIATE for the intended age group: smashing her baby on the rocks so he could rape the mother holding the child. Gratuitous and completely unnecessary. Makes me wonder about the author, although his credentials look good on paper! Disgusting. Will never take the chance with him again and will certainly not allow my boys to read his work."
5,A great fantasy,"I was completely unfamiliar with T.A. Barron prior to this book, and was immediately drawn into the imaginative and exquisitely created world of Avalon. The characters take you on a journey from one incredible land to the next on a quest to save the great tree. I can't wait for the next of this wonderous series."
4,"Slow to start, fast to finish!",I had a little trouble with the first part of AVALON (I like to shorten the title). The characters were hard to love in the first few chapters and since i dont read fantasy very much i was not framiliar with Merlin and the Lady of the Lake. About 1/3 of the way into the book i just couldnt stop reading! I had to know who was going to join the journey next and how the rest of the characters were going to fit it. It all comes together in the end and leaves you waiting for part 2. I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes a good read
1,Lowered Standard,"T.A. Barron's Lost Years of Merlin epic is among my favorite series of books, a series that I consider to be up there with my other favorite series, The Belgariad/Mallorean cycle (by David Eddings), The Wheel of Time Series (by Robert Jordan), the Shannara books (by Terry Brooks), and Lord of the Rings (by the great J.R.R. Tolkien). When i heard of a sequel series to LYoM I was extremely excited, then severly let down. This isn't up to standard with the old Merlin series. There are many pieces of the two series that just don't fit. Maybe its my sentimentality for the old characters, but I just can't seem to connect to them. For any new readers, this would be a good book, but for returning Merlin fans, a big letdown."
4,Triple Yatzee score pads,I enjoyed the score pads and felt that they were perfect for the game. My only problem is that the cost was outrages!!!!!! I needed the pad so I feel the seller took advantage of the fact that they are hard to find. I will now make copies of the sheets instead of buying more. Paper and ink will still be a third of the price.
5,Victorinox Knives are the BEST,"I have several Victorinox knives and they are wonderful - super sharp. I have not been happy with other brands of steak knives of all types, until this one. It cuts meats as if they were butter and works to thinly slice vegetables as well, but I keep them just for steak. Highly recommend them."
4,Love the knife,I bought this knife after reading the reviews. Used it a lot this mango season to peel the mangoes. Enjoyed it a lot. Great knife. I have about 5 Victorinox knifes and love all of them.
4,Sharp,1. These badboyz are sharper than a Mo-fo2.they are a good deal and good for parring knife and steak and you can Shave with them like a mountain man too!
5,Victorinox is the Best!,I bought this small wavy edge knife after using the Victorinox chef's knife for a while and absolutely loving it. The Victorinox knives are simply the best. Sharp as a razor blade and fits nicely in the hand. This particular knife is great for soft foods with skins like tomatoes and summer fruits; also lemons and limes.
5,I always considered this a tomato knife,"BUT, you can cut anything from chicken to veggies with this knife (of course, you don't want to cut raw meat and then use it on veggies without washing it!)... It is extremely sharp and will cut tomato slices quite nicely and thin which is wonderful for BLT's if you like to stack tomatoes... But, it also is nice for trimming fat off meats, etc. because of the serration. I have 3 or 4 of these because I use them so much... OH, you can also use it to get mayo out of a jar... and then use it to slice your tomato, etc... with the same knife--- I've even bought these for gifts..."
3,Self Indulgent?,"During their self imposed exile to France in the late 60's The art Ensemble of Chicago recorded several lps; some were good and some were not so good, Spiritual falls in the latter. The biggest problem here is lack of direction and cohesiveness. There's no real clue as to what their intent was and much of whats here sounds rather self indulgent and given the amount of recordings that they made this was bound to happen. The title track meanders on for some 20 minutes or so and is very hard to listen to. As for the rest, some of it is okay but I just can't get into it. The three star rating is because it is an Art Ensemble of Chicago recording and given their importance anything they've recorded deserves a listen. Judge for yourself or seek out ""Baptizum"" and ""Fanfare For the Warriors"" or even Roscoe Mitchells ""Sound""."
5,A must for rose lovers.,"This is a tabletop book in a smaller format. The prose is flowery (of course) the art work sublime. Pages are so beautiful, they could be framed. I originally bought the book for the illustrations as I had seen it at a country house hotel in England (in the original French -- which I do not read). This book is the English translation -- philosophical rather than technical -- and rewarding to read."
5,Devolved: Funny and Poignant,"The movie ""Devolved"" is a wonderful cross between ""Lord of the Flies"" and ""American Pie"". It is both very funny and insightful. The characters are well drawn and the ensemble cast is an example of how a good Director can mesh disparate types into a unified whole. The performances of the three leads make this movie better than most teen genre productions. Rob Adamson is quite good in his portrayal of the stereotypical arrogant ""jock"" while Lyndsey Shaw as the point of the love triangle shows she is a very special young actress. Gary Entin shines in his portrayal of Flynn, the loner/outsider. Exhibiting a range not typical of young actors Entin moves from nerdy to popular insider and finally to the moral center of the piece in a seemless fashion. The entire film rocks with an energy that is hard to quantify, but ""Devolved"" and its young stars is a film well worth watching and owning"
5,Book club winner!,"I purchased this book for a children's book club (ages 8-10). We read the book over a 4 week period (we meet every two weeks). The kids all really enjoyed this book (we don't find many titles that every member likes, so this is a big deal). The story was fresh and new, and it had lots of twists and turns the kids could follow and appreciate. The chapters went fast (always a plus with kids!). There were a lot of small details that I thought the kids may have trouble noticing and/or remembering, but they did as well (if not better) than the parents! The main characters were very likeable, and their adventure was very extraordinary. If I had to categorize the book, I'd say it is like a shorter, less complicated Harry Potter... but DEFINITELY not a copycat title. Our group really enjoyed this book. (Note: the children in the group are a little advanced for their ages, may not be for all 8 year olds level-wise)."
5,great fun worthy of a sequel,"I had great fun reading about the trials and tribulations of Joe and Twiggy. Two young people worked hard, and succeded while the adults were sometimes foundering. To be honest, I like a book where the young people are honest, (well most of the time if you read the book) and dedicated (all of the time if you read the book). It's worth reading as an adult or as a child....I just hope the author has planned a sequel.Of course, my delight in this book is in the fact that Twiggy is a young witch who is learning...Kids, don't try this at home, but...enjoy a wonderful story!"
4,"Funny, heart-warming story.","The story takes a little too long to take root (which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5) and the eccentricity of the witches is a little annoying in places. But, in the end, the book is a joy to read. Lots of funny moments. Plenty of quirky characters. A main character we care about, and several lovable secondary characters. And enough danger and action to drive the story along. What more could you want?Buy this book if you like magic mixed with humor (a la Eva Ibbotson, Diana Wynne Jones or Edward Eager)."

5,"Full, Complete and Up-to-date Guide","This guide to wireless security is very well written. I highly recommend it for anyone who needs to get up to speed on the wireless technology for implementation, use and security. This is top notch.G. A. GrantUW Net Admin"
5,Saddle Up and Head Out,Even to the casual observer this is good stuff but if you're a true sniffhead then you're in for some incredibly geeky fun. The whole book* is a good but I found chapters 9-11 the most fascinating. You can't go wrong with this material.*Refers to eBook version
1,NOT SAME BAND AS CROSSFADE FROM THE USA,"Hi I just purchased this cd thinking it would be a great rock import for the band ""crossfade"" --WRONG-- this isn't the same band that has the hit ""Cold"" no this band is some happy Swedish folk music band....so just to warn you..unless you actually listen to this exact cd....it isn't rock...it isnt the same band...so dont get it...thought i would warn you from my mistake...D*mn Im mad about this... :("
2,not what I thought it would be,"So I buy this CD thinking it was from the REAL Crossfade and was promptly disappointed. This CD is good in its own rights (good west-coast music) but, as my title says, it's not what I thought it would be. A definite loser in my book."
4,Don't be a dork,"This is good West-Coast AOR for sure, but I am confused by the people who bought this thinking it was the American band Crossfade (who incidentally, this band can easily outplay, even though they're ""grandparent"" music as was so poetically stated previously). This album is not my specific taste musically, but I totally appreciate the talent and songwriting skills these guys possess. So, if you're looking for the American band Crossfade, THIS IS NOT THEM. Do some research before you plunk down $40 or $50 on an import! COMMON SENSE PEOPLE!!!"
2,Not up to expectations,"Unfortunately, I just put this guitar back in the box and taped it up to be returned. The official reason for the return was some shipping damage, but I decided to get a refund instead of a replacement because the quality of the instrument (aside from the damage) was not worth the purchase price to me.There were small cracks around the sides of the instrument where the electronics were installed as if the screws had been overtightened. When running your hand down the side of the neck, rough ends of the frets stuck over the edge. There were several areas where the finish had already began to bubble or peel back. All in all, I was shocked at poor quality after the positive things I had heard about Luna guitars. I did think that the parlor-sized body and slender neck were comfortable and well-designed, which made it that much more disappointing to pack it up and send it away."
1,Made in China,"Don't trust the reviews, go to the guitar store and check it by yourself. Use your common sense to check if a guitar is durable. I also own another Luna electric thats made in Korea. The quality is ok except one of the frets had to be replaced. This acoustic to me its a trash. I had to replace 2 of the frets that caused buzz."
2,A little disapointed,The title of the sale item was refurbished parlor guitar. Unfortunatley the term refurbished did not suggest the unboard electronics did not work or that there was a crack in the upper bout of the top sheet.
4,Faith No More side oddity,"I'm a huge FNM fan and bought this strictly for them. Must say though, the song is quite catchy & goofy. FNM is only on the 3:00 version that was a re-do from the original in 1974!?! All 3 versions of the song are great & completly different from each other.It's a great addition to the hardcore fan of either band. Recommended!"
5,AWESUM!!!,Got this for my daughter. She absolutly loved it!! Was her favorite christmas gift. A must have for any MCR fan!

5,An Answer to Prayer,"'At last, to the one Hope Ashton had offered when she found herself stranded alone on a blustery Montana night. Contrary to her matchmaking Nanna's belief, Hope didn't long to land a husband-and her old pal wasn't looking for a wife. But that didn't stop Hope from secretly wondering what if...?What could a widowed country cowboy possibly have in common with a millionaire's sophisticated daughter? Absolutely nothing-save the desire to stay single. But Matthew was a lonely, red-blooded man. He was also proud papa to a determined trio of toddlers who yearned for a mommy-and they'd set their sights on Hope...'"
2,very cute but too small,"these shoes are very cute indeed.. i bought the black in these shoes and a 9.5 which is my exact size and they a bit tight. i find that they are small for the size. they are very narrow to the top, so order with caution, u may need to order a half-size bigger. they are supposed to be leather so i hope they stretch cuz they really are cute!"
5,"Lovely Art, Lovely Poetry",The fairy art in this is unique and exquisite. Each image goes very well with the sweetly written poetry along side it. Wonderful to read to a child or yourself to lift you spirits!
3,Odiferous,When I received the Roaster Oven I followed the instructions on heating the roaster up to burn off the manufacturing residues. The instructions were to heat it at 450 degrees for two hours. It was so smelly in the kitchen that I moved out to the patio. This was two days before Thanksgiving. The roaster was heated to 450 three separate times for a total of several hours. On Thanksgiving it was still giving off fumes so I was afraid to use it for the turkey. This was the main reason for purchasing the product. It was used at Christmas for a ham and the fumes were much less and didn't seem to affect the ham's taste or quality. Except for the described problem the product is what I expected and should perform well in the future.
4,Parents Guide,"This is a great book for parents. Clinicians will also find it useful. It does not lend itself as well as I had hoped to use in a monitored pediatric program. By spanning the entire course of childhood and adolescence, it contains ""big picture"" which is useful to parents but would need to be supplemented to concentration on problems at any given age."
4,An excelent song.,"This is a fantastic dance song, one of the best from the 90's. It is an unforgetable song. Overall Excellent. Rock on Space Brothers!!!"
2,Not very useful,I was expecting more from this book. A scattered array of radiology tidbits. Not anything you can read straight through. Buy a review radiology textbook before you sink money into this one.
4,Radiology review,"As other secret series texts compliment their core topics so does this one. It's always fun to extract the secret series pearls not found in other clinical textbooks. Explanations of roentgenographic pathology is thorough. However, as a correctional nurse practitioner I read many x-ray films but never the more advanced imaging modalities. I would like to see more standard x-ray films in the next edition.Peter Watson MA, MSN, ANP"
2,"sleek look, nice alternative, but poor funtionality","The main problem is the tendency for the unit to pull away from the wall after a short amount of use. The constant pulling out and pushing in of the keys into the foam interior simply causes to much stress on the wimpy drywall anchors/screws and the entire unit starts to droop and then ultimately pulls off the wall. To get this thing to look as nice on your wall as it does on the box, you must mount it in a piece of solid wood (like a stud)."
3,The man playing US Grant also plays in the Surrender at Appomattox Video,"This was not a poorly done film, save in that they had access to one of my 'generals', General Grant (the Grant from my film on Amazon.com entitled the Surrender at Appomattox (2007)). Tony Daniels is an excellent Grant, and our Lee, Dave Palmer, is the best Lee I have worked with to date ( I have also worked with the Lee in this film, in my early works, but I now work exclusively with Dave Palmer).My one main hang-up with this film is that the generals are not showcased as well as they deserve to be seen... Powers Booth styled voiceovers are okay, but these men with whom I work, (Tony Daniels, in this film) have the actual surrender memorized! To not use them to the best advantage was a waste of great talent. I know. Tony and Dave do this several times a year, and absolutely live the parts!"
4,Cinelli Cork Handlebar Tape,"I put this cork wrap on my Fixed Gear Bike. The quality is good and it offers some vibration dampening which keeps my hands comfortable.I like that it's made from a sustainable/natural resource. The cork has some elasticity to it, making installation easy. The cork itself has a nice feel."
4,learned tons,"Although the some of the soundtrack left much to be desired, especially with the initial bluegrassy poorly mixed/poorly written track where the vocalist couldn't keep up with the instruments and the last grunge rock track, I learned tons. I missed the 'goofy Washington boosterism' mentioned by another reviewer, who apparently lives in the 'wrong' WA....i.e. DC. Having just watched another wine DVD where an Old World vintner jumped viciously on a film crew guy who casually picked a grape to munch...this DVD underlies the more accessible winery atmosphere in WA. I got bored with the promotion of 'silky tannins' as I can't drink reds and missed any coverage of the lively light Rieslings I prefer."
2,Spit don't swallow,"Excruciating. Interesting information, especially about the area's geology, is saturated with goofy Washington boosterism. A trite pop music soundtrack, wet as Seattle, and an android narrator don't help. Winemakers contribute some useful nuggets, but I like the wines much better than the dvd."
2,For Santana fans only-- an interesting historical recording,"Hear the roots of Carlos Santana with some long jams and lots of San Francisco rock. A lot firey guitar solos if you're into such things, along with the occasional more lyrical voicings that Santana tends toward nowadays."
2,too fragile,"Beautiful furniture, but very delicate. We had broken furniture within a couple times of my daughter playing with it. May be better for older kids."
5,A Real Hit with Granddaughter,Very cool! My granddaughter loved it. It goes well with the Princess Castle her Daddy made her. It has real working drawers!
5,Love this and recommend the 40 pc. dish set,"These arrived quickly and was packaged well. The chairs are very nice and the fabric really adds to the charm of a Victorian Dollhouse. The china cabinet has opening doors to display miniatures. Very nice! I recommend adding the small miniature 40 pc. place setting of dishes and silverware to add to the fun of setting the table for dinner and then displaying them in the cabinet windows. Search here on Amazon for dollhouse miniature dishes to add, they cost about $3 and really adds to the fun of this item."
1,Hang Anywhere Shower Caddy by Better Bath,"The Shower Caddy arrived by the promised date. This product is good and strong, will hold as much as I need.Unfortunately it does not fit the purpose I bought it for. I have a previous Shower Caddy that allows me to hang it in the shower, where there is a soap dish in the way so this new Shower Caddy will not hang straight, as my old Shower Caddy does.Do to the design of the cross bars back support on the new Shower Caddy I can not mount the Caddy as I wish to.If the Shower Caddy is hung on the shower head arm unobstructed by any protrusions on the wall of the shower it would have been just fine.However I have it in a box at my home, not able to use."
4,Ducati neophite,"I am perhaps not qualified to judge the value of the book, but find myself going to it for information whenever I contemplate a purchase of a new ducati to add to my stable.To have any information is better than none when shopping for these machines, only time will tell the value of the information"
3,"Great overview of older Ducati models, not the 4 valve models","I purchased this looking for information on the four valve Ducati superbikes. I thought that this third edition would give some production figures and maybe model features or differences, it didn't. I also thought that a buyer's guide would have serial number information, it does not. It still is a good resource and it even has a chapter on Ducati powered Bimota models."
5,Son loves them,Bough them for my boy at the suggestion of his band director. He loves them. Great during his concert season.
4,Von Rezzori - sadly underrated,"The Kirkus reviewer of this book missed the point--calling Von Rezzori's prose ""overwritten"" is a bit like calling Pollock's painting ""busy."" He is a writer very conscious of the excesses of his style and in the post-Joycean era might argue that reasonableness in contemporary literature is an anachronism. Unlike the last reviewer, though, I found ""The Orient-Express"" middling Von Rezzori. Far better, for different reasons, are ""Oedipus at Stalingrad"" and ""The Death of My Brother Abel""--now scandalously out of print, at least in this country. Personally I believe Von Rezzori superior to both Thomas Mann and Robert Musil as a European novelist of ideas--but I won't take the space to justify that assessment here."
2,Makes this subject more complicated than it is....,"My main complaint with this author is that he takes 10 pages to say a paragraph. The read is so tiresome that reading this author becomes very unpleasant. For every technique, you learn, you must deal with 10-15 pages of airy-fairy fluff. I would recomend some of the other authors whom are much more direct, and not trying to sell endless courses and books."
3,Not a greatbook for reading to toddlers,"i bought this for my 3 year old son, he loves elephants and I knew he would love the story. However, the book is too wordy without enough pictures and sometimes skips information that may be clearer for an older child but leaves a younger one baffled. Also, he has had a hard time understanding why they would separate a baby elephant from his mommy and put her in a cage..."
2,A little odd,"I bought a collection of these older Golden Books stories thinking they would be sweet and ""old-fashioned"" but I have to admit they are all a little odd. Most were written in a time when things weren't totally geared towards kids as they are today. The book is very wordy and the pictures are fairly sparse. The story is a good one, but is buried in a lot of detail. Not great for a 2-year-old. Maybe older kids would like it better. This one ends oddly with Dumbo securing a good salary and a pension for his mother. Actually, maybe that is a good lesson for kids now that I think about it!"
1,Didn't work,I bought a case of this product to remove the moles in my yard. I was told by the yard guy that this would do the job. I applied 8 bottles to my entire lawn over the summer. I still have moles and they did more damage to my lawn after the application than they had before.
1,stilted,"As a heavy reader, lover of complex mysteries, and female landscape architect, I was SO looking forward to this book since the author is a woman and an architect. I was so dissapointed and was unable to plod through the heavy, stilted, unnatural conversation. I thought a contemporary book featuring a woman in a traditionally male industry written by a woman who is actually in a traditionally male industry would feature stronger female characters that reflect reality (we work, make decisions, are equals with our partners). I didn't think the characters were realistic at all for contemporary times, conversation was awkward and the women in the book were wimpy dependant characters. It takes a lot for me to put a book down before I'm done, but this was so plodding and awkward and sad."
4,A good book in a good series,"This is the fourth Rozan novel I have read (I am reading them in order) and it was very enjoyable. Rozan may not write truly excellent novels (five stars), but she consistently writes very good ones (four stars). This book would rate five stars if it wasn't for a few minor flaws. For example, after a worker is injured, Smith is the only one out of a large crowd of contruction workers who has the sense to apply basic first aid. That seemed a little unbelievable to me. Also, there is a final revelation at the end of the book that I thought would be something major but it wasn't, really. That is nitpicking, however. Bill and Lydia are very entertaining, as always. The other characters are interesting and well-developed, the plot is complex and believable and the dialogue is well-done. In my opinion, Rozan is definitely one of the best mystery writers in the business today."
5,Setting Makes the Story,"This is by far my favorite of the first four of Rozan's books in the Chin/Smith series. In it, both Bill Smith (the story is told from his point of view) and Lydia Chin are working undercover to determine who's behind the murders at a NYC construction site. Smith is working as a mason on the site, and Chin is working in the company headquarters. The setting is excellent: a reader can almost sense the height, feel the pace of work, and taste the grit as the highrise inches its way toward the sky. If you're a reader who loves setting, you'll enjoy this book. The plot is realistic and the solution is satisfying."
5,Great book with an interesting setting,"I loved this book and found the setting of the construction site very interesting. This author obviously has knowledge of these areas, and puts them together to make a wonderful mystery."
1,Rubbish (zero stars),"I bought this book based on some favourable on-line reviews but I didn't get past the first chapter. I suspect those other reviews were written either by the author or her friends and relatives. Apart from being badly written this book is written in the first person perspective and that character is supposed to be a rough and tough rigger working on a construction site. However it reads like a book written by a woman who is imagining what goes through the mind of such a guy rather than actually by a guy who can actually relate to these experiences. And that is in fact the case, the author is a woman named S.J.Rozan. However, I suspect that if she wrote a novel on a subject that she actually had some empathy for, it would still be terrible, as she can't write."
1,Verilux bulbs blow out very quickly!,"I have spent a lot of money on natural spectrum lightbulbs over the years. The extra money seems like a good trade off given the better quality of light and the lifetime of the bulb as stated by the manufacturer. However, I have experienced very short lives with Verilux bulbs. When I contacted Verilux, the company stated that there are too many factors that affect the bulbs for them to guarantee that they live up to their claims. Sounds like fraudulent marketing, does it not? Stay away from this brand unless you simply have too much money and need to find a way to get rid of some. The company's exact response, as copied from my live chat, follows:Evelyn: We do guarantee our bulbs for 30 days for manufactures defect. There are so many factors that determine a bulbs life outside of our control that we can only offer the 30 day warranty."
2,Poor logic and history,"The positions of this book are very weak. Morey's work is not based on exegesis. Instead of reading things from the book; he reads things INTO the book. The fact that the trinity is post-biblical can easily be seen by reading other great books on this topic such as:Ehrmann's ""The Orthodox Corruption of Scripture"" or ""When Jesus became God"" or better yet the Bible itself:For us there is one God, the Father--= 1 Cor 8:6 This is eternal life that they might know You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom You sent.--John 17:2"
4,Good survey and defense of Trinitarianism,"I've always had a tough time trying to explain the doctrine of the Trinity to people. But Dr. Morey does a solid job of discussing not only the history of the formulation of the doctrine of the Trinity, but he goes into the Old Testament (and even refers to the Hebrew text) and shows how there is evidence of plurality within the Godhead in texts such as Genesis 1:26; 3:2; Genesis 18; Is 9:6; 48:16; 63:9; Zech 2:10-11, and others.He then moves through the New Testament evidence, and discusses such passages as Matthew 3:16-18; 28:18-20 and passages dealing with the relationship between the Father and the Son.The book is academic in nature, yet is simply written and very informative. It isn't quite as engaging as his prior work, ""Death and the Afterlife,"" but it is one of the better books on the subject of the Trinity."
5,Helpful book on the Trinity.,A very good place to start. The Biblical material is well researched. Methodologically sound and Biblically faithful. This review has been edited after I realized I made a mistake in critiquing Dr. Morey's book.
1,Poor sound quality,"Another awful CD from Delta. These tracks must have been copied from very old vinyl records, with no remastering effort. They are recorded really loud to make up for the poor sound, and the overall effect is excruciating when you play the CD."
2,Expensive swing - not much use for infant,I received this swing as a baby gift in 2004 and used it for my daughter. She did not get much use from it then. I am now using it for my 6 month old and still do not use it too much. The swing is not appropriate for a newborn because the back of the seat does not recline enough which makes the baby's head come forward. As the baby gets bigger she can sit in it confortably but not comfortable enough to nap in. The other day a very scary situation occurred when she pulled herself to a sitting position on one of the swings hanging fish. She then fell over to the side and got her head wedged between the two bars of the swing(The one bar with the fish in it). If I was not in the room with her she would have fallen out of the swing! My baby is on the smaller side and if she can get herself into a position such as this one I would hate to see what could happen to a larger baby.
2,Great While it Lasted,"My son was small for his age for the first few months, but this swing was perfect for him. He would watch us do housework or sleep... By the time he weighed 16lbs though, it wouldn't rock fast enough to keep him happy and he kept trying to crawl out."
3,"Good idea, but needs minor improvements","This portable swing is a great thing....folds pretty flat for easy travel, and is still sturdy. Our son loves to watch the lights, but the yellow light on ours never lit up. Also, it doesn't swing very fast....we have to crank it up to full speed to equal the amount of swing he gets on the first level in the full size swing. But he still enjoys it. Would be nice to have a reset button on the music like the full size swing has...you have to turn it off and back on again to get the music to restart, it only plays for a few minutes."
3,Liked the older model better,I would probably buy it a third time if there were no other travel swings. I had the old model for my now 3 year old and thought it was much better. It had straps to hold the swing when folded and a smaller. This newer version is too big to be a travel swing. just a big swing low to the ground. So we dug out the old one and use that.... Same swing just a different year.
4,Swing to Sleep,"This swing quickly puts our son to sleep and so I would recommend buying it just for that! We have had it since the day he was born and he is still using it at 9 months (it does have a maximum weight of 25lbs). Earlier on he couldn't interact with it very much but know he is bigger he can pull on the fish to turn on the lights and music.The seat is easy to remove for washing and easy to get back on.The only drawback is that when he is in it it is very heavy to move. If I wanted to move him to a quieter place, I was staggering with it. But then, my muscles are like knots in cotton.So, when all else failed to get him to sleep, the swing always worked."
1,DO NOT GET ON AMAZON! GET AT KHOLS!,"YOU CAN GET THIS SWING AT KOHLS FOR $50!!!!! AND IF YOU USE CODES ""NOCHARGE"" AND ""EXTRA20"" YOU GET 20% OFF AND NO SHIPPING!!!!"
3,It'll do....,"My baby is now 5 mo.'s old. For some reason he never wanted to stay in it long when he was younger. Now he might last in it 15 min's at the most. The speeds do not vary even though it has 8 speeds. One of the hanging fish do not have the plastic cut out so you can hang something from it. The box shows it should. The model in the store is the same as mine. Overall, this swing will do but it could use some improvements."
3,Product OK. Shipping Damage,"The product was received in a timely manner. However, it was not shipped in a shipping box, but rather in the products own box. It arrived bashed and torn. It was very bad. I called UPS and asked what to do. They said I could open the box to inspect the contents. If any damage was present i could file a claim with them or contact the shipper. The product appeared to be ok. Wasn't happy about it at all though."
1,Not worth the price!!,"I bought this swing after reading all the nice reviews on various websites. The first time I bought it, the product did not work. I had to return and get another one. My daughter barely used it since she did not like it that much. I then packed it away so I could use it for my next child. When I unpacked it after the birth of my second daughter, I found that the aquarium on the side had started leaking. The fluid is all oily and the whole swing is covered in that. Also, when I put in new batteries, it did not work.Overall, I have had a very bad experience with this swing!!"
2,so not worth it,"Well We had the entire Ocean Aquarium set, big swing, this swing, bouncer , and crib thing. He liked the crib thing and the big swing. The only thing about this swing that was good was the fact that it folded up and you could throw it in the car and take it places. The thing I disliked was 1.when he was a newborn he would always fall over cause the seat wouldn't recline enough. 2. When he got maybe 15 pounds he would fall forward and the swing tipped over with him strapped in. So all together it was pretty much useless."
3,Swing is ok - nothing great,We have the full size Oceans Aquarium swing and absolutely love it - but the smaller one isn't as good. There is no speed control and the speed it does swing on is too fast for my baby. It does fold up nicely and the lights keep my baby's interest.
3,"Great swing, poor seat design","I bought this swing as an extra swing to keep at my parents house. Our baby loved the lights and music and the swing never failed to rock her to sleep. The only problem was that as soon as she fell asleep her head would fall off the side of the seat and bang into the swing's legs as it went back and forth. The seat just isn't deep enough to cradle her head. I've tried this swing over and over again because I do love it otherwise, but even as she gained more head control it still falls off the side when she sleeps. My advice is to not leave your sleeping infant unattended in this swing even just to take a shower!"
2,be careful who you buy from,I had this same baby swing a few years ago. I wanted a new one for my new grandchild. I was excited to find it on line. It was shipped to me without parts. I'm still waiting!!!!! Not Happy
5,great travel swing,Our daughter loves to hang out or sleep in a swing. As a newborn we would take her to relatives homes and then carry her big cluncky swing so that she would have a place to sit or nap while we were there. It was always a big deal to go anyplace we didn't want to go. This swing makes it easy. It folds up easily and compactly. It fits under her car seat and behind the front seat of the car! Now she actually enjoys this swing better then the big one. Her favorite thing to do is make the lights a music start by pulling on the toys.
2,Not Good,The music and the light is too short. It stop after few minutes. The speed doesn't work. Speed 1 to 8 is the same for all and it is too fast for infant.
2,"Love the big one, pass on this one","We own the big aquarium swing and cannot stop singing its praises. It was given to us by our friends who love theirs, my hairdresser loved hers..............However, this one is nothing compared to it. There is no distinction in the speed control. It is one speed, period. The light show and music are not impressive and they give you a little yellow toy to attach to the fish but the fish on one side is not missing the interior to hang it from.The deciding factor was, however, that Josh falls asleep every time in the big one and screamed his lungs out in this one. Decision to return made."
3,Pretty good swing,"I bought this swing because my daughter loved the other oceans aquarium swing. It's nice and it folds up and is easy to take along, but my daughter never really got into this swing. She always scooted herself down and was almost laying sideways in it! We only used it a handful of times, and I wish I would have saved my money instead of buying this! Not a bad product, we just never got to use it enough to have good or bad points about it."
3,Swing has pros and cons,"There were many advantages to this swing:* Size was good for our small house* Was easy to fold up, or even just carry to different areas of the house, or on trips* My son loved the music and lights* He was really thrilled once he got a little older and realized he could prompt the music by pulling th fish on the sides* It was really helpful early onHowever, there are also several improvements that could be made:* Even from the beginning when my son didn't weigh as much, the swing was slow* It ate through batteries really fast* Once my son was able to sit up, the swing was not really stable enough for him, in fact it really just seemed unsafe at that point.Overall, the swing is good, but won't last as long as a larger, sturdier one."
4,Great to keep in the car...,"We registered for this swing just to keep in the car in case we ended up somewhere where our baby would be bored with nothing to keep him entertained. This swing is perfect for that. He loves to look at the fish and the lights and the music is great. I love that he can activate it himself by pulling on the fish that hang down. It folds up nicely and is compact enough. It seems pretty sturdy (he has been in the 95th percentile since birth). It is very entertaining but without being annoying. I definitely recommend this. I wouldn't use it as my primary swing, but it is good to have with you on the road."
4,Great gift!!!,"I bought one used from a coworker. My first daughter loved the swing so I figured this would be a good investment. I love that the seat is more upright than laid back. It's easy to fold, lightweight and works wonderfully. The only thing I would change is the swing seems to move very slowly (I have new batteries). Of course, I did get mine used so this could be due to that??"
4,Wonderful gift,I received this swing as a baby shower gift. My daughter who is now almost five months enjoys using it and has used it since she was born.The seat is washable and is easy to remove. I also love that it folds up for easy storage.The only down side is that the swing does not have a plug and uses batteries only. It does not seem to burn through the batteries as much as we thought it would.
4,I like this swing,"Generally speaking, I like this swing. It's entertaining, affordable and easy to transport. A couple of things that needs improving: The music dies after several tunes; and the speed control doesn't change the speed that much."
1,Chair broke while my baby was in it,"I bought this swing because it wouldn't take up too much room, but that was a mistake. This swing broke while my baby was in it. I screamed, then he cried. It was horrible. I don't recommend this item at all. I bought a large sturdy swing instead."
2,Doesn't hold baby's attention,"We are borrowing this swing from a friend and are not impressed. Her daughter only liked it from about age 4 months to 5 months, so they got little use from it. My son is 3 months and often screams the minute we put him in it. When he does sit in it he is only happy for a few minutes. I was surprised because he has always absolutely loved his full sized swing. Considering the limited time this swing can be used for I would skip it and buy the full sized swing. However, it does fold extremely compact for travel."
2,Disappointed,I was so excited to get this swing for my newborn because I remembered how much I used my full size swing for my oldest daughter when she was a baby. I absolutely loved the music on this portable swing. I love how it looks and how portable and compact it is. The only thing - which is the main feature - is the swing speed. There are 8 speeds of which 1 - 5 barely move at all. I have to have it all the way to 8 to get a decent motion going and that is only if I help it. I am going to return it - so disappointing since I loved everything else about it.
1,went thru 2 and neither worked,"The first swing I received was defective and I didn't realize until it was basically all put together. Taking it apart was a MAJOR pain! My husband had to unscrew things that had come already assembled to be able to take it apart. The 2nd one we got looked fine. After it was put together we noticed when it was at speed 8 it went slower then speed 7. 8 is supposed to be the fastest and was more like 1. Maybe I just got 2 bad ones of this swing, but either way, I'm not getting a 3rd to find out!"
2,Great concept but....,"I bought this swing so I could use it at work when I took my baby in with me. It's very portable and doesn't take up too much space. It was great at first, and there were no worries about the baby folding over like in some swings. Our son ended up being too heavy after a couple of months and his bottom would drag on the carpet and he would end up stopping himself. While he started off as a tiny little guy, once he started putting on the weight we could no longer use it. I also would have liked if it reclined a little more, perhaps this would have prevented his bumm from dragging so much."
1,Horrible,"Don't waste your money on this sauce. Much better off making your own especially if you want low sodium. The best I can describe this is ""it taste like cardboard."" I threw it away."
1,highlighting,"This used book was not in ""very good conditions"", first 70 pages are highlighted importantly. I should have know this."
5,My favorite horse book,I actually wrote the riding school in England that was noted in the front page of the book. That's how much this book touched my life. Great book.. absolutely part of my growing up years. Good lesson on ultimately finding the best in a tough situation.
5,Loved this book as a child,"I was totally drawn into the story as it progressed, and years afterwards kept re-reading it. If you love horses, you'll love it. If you don't, the story is still interesting and I bet you'll enjoy it."
5,If you are really interested in your children,"learning Sánish, THIS IS IT !There are nine of these CHISTES FAVORITOS DE LOS NIÑOS BOOKS, and the whole collection drives the kids to understand in order to enjoy the jokes ...Besides, the coloring drawings are GREAT !!!"
4,Not bad at all.,This book was really quite good to help supplement my animal nutrition class. It was easy reading.The only thing I could say was it could go into a little more detail.
1,"Cheap, but not worth it!","I'm always on the lookout for a bargain, but these binoculars were not it. The optics were fair, but not bright. Most importantly, the pair I received were not waterproof. If you plan to take these boating and store them in a humid environment, be prepared for fogging problems. In addition, the focus adjustment is very poorly engineered. The internal compass was well lit, but is not damped well enough for small boat use. Spend a bit more for something better."
1,Looney tunes; spotlight collection vol 2,Wanted more of Michagan J. Frog- only included a feature- not too happy with this- advertising should have been better for this DVD
4,Entertaining,"My kids ages 7, 4, and 2 all love this. It keeps them entertained in the car very well!"
1,Looney Tunes 2,"There were no yosemetie sam cartoons on this dvd, although he is on the cover. False advertising"
2,2 outta 4 since it's half of the other set.....,"It's cost effective, yes. But Looney vol. 2 Spotlight Collection is in actuality - discs 3 and 4 of the Gold Set without any of the extras. There is a short feature on disc 1 on how to draw the characters and a short on disc 2 where you animate some musical number...In essence - there are a LOT of Tweety cartoons and then a hodge podge of Bugs and Elmer etc....Disc 1 of the 4 set has Bugs cartoons and Disc 2 is mainly Road Runner, so if you aren't a huge fan of those then the 2 disc set could be the way to go. One plus is that What's Opera Doc and One Froggy Evening are included..."
4,cartoons,Looney Tunes - The Spotlight Collection - Volume 2seen a lot of cartoons i had not seen in years
4,The cartoons we remember...or do we?,"I watched these cartoons, some I remember well and enjoyed--of course these were purchsed for my kids. The problem is that one of the volumes has some very old cartoons with saloon dancing and men turning red over flurtatious women...something I don't remember...so, preview both DVDs and be sure you're comfortable with them before playing in front of the kids."
4,Loonies galore!,"Relax, laugh and enjoy. Remember when the movies at the thratre had acartoon? Here you have more. You have CARTOONS! Treat your kidsto what it used to be like, and enjoy it with them."
3,Hoped for Bugs Bunny,"I thought this would have more Bugs but it hasn't any. Tweety Bird, Sylvester and somebody else. Still those are good but wanted more mix."
5,Modern kids still love these toons,"Grew up watching these cartoons as a kid, now it's my childrens' turn. My son can't go a day without watching at least an episode or two....."
2,An alright collection,"The first thing that suckered me into getting this cheap watered down LT dvd collection is the fact that they have a misleading back cover of little red riding rabbit which is not in this collection and may I ask why? because they just want your money! Now to be fair this isn't A really bad collection but you can get this same much better collection added with a real golden collection for 30 bucks or more (golden collection vol 2).If your a big looney tunes fan then don't get this, The golden collections are way better!"
5,Division III: Football's Finest Review,"This movie is really funny! I was laughing non-stop. Andy Dick gives an outstanding performance and there were great jokes throughout. The actors were talented and the director did a great job of breaking the comedy mold. This movie was wild compared to all of the big budget, watered-down comedy movies normally released. I saw it in a theater but I can't wait to see it on blu-ray."
2,Expectations Not Met,"I heard from a friend this movie was funny and it did have its moments, but it is more for rent... not for purchase."
4,tittering,"This is a decently funny movie. Honestly, I was pleasantly surprised. The acting isn't great but the writing makes up for it."
5,Great Quality and Makes Learning Fun,We love this puzzle. It's been perfect for our four year old. The pieces are big and sturdy. The planets are labeled and our daughter loves learning their names. I would highly recommend this for any child ages three and up.
5,Great puzzle and very well made!,"My grandson who is 28 months took a liking to the solar system. Knows all the planets names and in order of closest to the sun. So when we got him this he was just into it from the get go. Although he is slightly too young to complete the entire puzzle himself he loves looking for the pieces to all the specific planets as he goes. With some help he completes it and is very happy about it. He usually sits or stands on the puzzle while doing it and the puzzle takes the abuse. I must say it is beautifully done, colorful and detailed. Would highly recommend it to any children who take an interest in the Solar system, planets or any puzzle for that matter."
5,educational,My girls were so excited to open this at Christmas time. They were excited to recognize earth. As they put the puzzle together they were kneeling on the pieces trying to get the pieces where they need to go. The puzzle seems to be very strong where kneeling on them won't hurt them. The colors on the puzzle are sharp. I was very impressed. I think this puzzle is a good way to get your kids to know what planets there are and what they look like.
4,"Good, sturdy puzzle but....","This puzzle is really nice. It's very sturdy, the pieces fit together nicely, my 3 year old loves it! I would really like to give it 5 stars, BUT... it's missing Pluto! Why make a puzzle of our solar system and not include all of the planets?? Aside from that one, minor detail, it's a great puzzle and my 3 year old wouldn't know that one planet was missing anyway haha."
3,PLUTO IS MISSING,"BOUGHT THIS PUZZLE WHEN IT WAS ON SALE FROM AMAZON.THE QUALITY OF THE PUZZLE IS GOOD. THE PIECES ARE A NICE SIZE AND SEEM LIKE IT WOULD LAST LONG. THE DOWNSIDE IS THAT PLUTO IS MISSING (AT LEAST ON MY PUZZLE) AND THE PLANETS ARE NOT LINED UP IN ORDER SO IT LOOKS LIKE A MESS IN OUTER SPACE!THAT MEANS, IT LOSES OUT ON THE EDUCATIONAL VALUE. WHICH IS WHY I RATED IT 2 STARS.TO MAXIMIZE THE BENEFIT OF THIS PUZZLE, MELISSA AND DOUG SHOULD HAVE PAID MORE EMPHASIS ON THE LAYOUT OF THE PLANETS RATHER THAN THE COLORS AND EFFECTS."
2,Great Graphics...Poor Substance,"Melissa and Doug created a puzzle that has magnificent art work. It is sturdy and durable. Yet, it lacks educational value. Let me explain. Most of us learned the solar system from the Sun to Pluto. This puzzle places the moon first and does not have a Pluto. Imagine my awkwardness in explaining to my child that there are 9 planets in the solar system, but Pluto is no where on the puzzle. How embarrassing. Plus the geocentric view of self that has been promoted is not good either. Look carefully at Solar System puzzles before buying. This puzzle is not worth the price if you are looking to educate your children."
5,Educational and Fun,My 3 and 4 year old LOVE puzzles and this is a favorite they often choose. My daughter now names the planets in the picture. I highly recommend this puzzle!
3,Melissa & Doug Solar System 48 pcs Floor Puzzle,"Just received this item on Friday, February, 17, 2012, my 5 1/2 year old son put it together, with assistance, the same evening. He put it together again on Saturday, February 18th and more than half of the pieces are splitting. It looks really good put together and its an excellent way to teach the Solar System but the quality of the pieces are absolutely horrible. His grandfather suggests gluing the pieces together but I just bought this item and should not have to."
4,a great gift for a 4 years old,The puzzle is made from heave weight paper. it is very durable. It is a easy puzzle just right for 3-4 year old kids. It is a good training on their observation; and they can learn the solar system as well. I like it.
1,Where is pluto?,This is a very lame puzzle. Many people reject the IAU definition of planet and still include Pluto as the ninth planet in our solar system. I will never buy a puzzle without Pluto being included.
5,Best toy quality...,"Melissa and Dough have a long history of very good educational, durable and economic toys in the market. This floor puzzle is very durable, resistant and educational. I just love their toys!!"
5,love it.,this is my sons favorite jigsaw floor puzzle. It is really big and he loves doing it with his papa. He learned all the planet names and now my son (age four) wants to learn more about planets and space.
4,Good teaching tool,Big pieces for big fun. We had already have this and purchased for a birthday gift for a friend who loves planets and learning about them.
5,Great fun! An educational toy your child will love!,"This puzzle is very sturdy; not as bendy as most puzzles. My daughter loves putting this puzzle together. She is five and we are learning about the Solar System. I like this toy because after you put it together you can quiz your child on Solar system facts. Ask your child to point out which planet is the largest (Jupiter...although in this puzzle they make earth look larger because of the perspective)Ask him/her which planet is the smallest, which planet is closest to the sun...etc...etc...the learning never ends! There are always new solar system facts you can add into your fun! I strongly recommend this toy as a fun learning tool for you and your child. I really love all the Melissa and Doug products."
5,Great Puzzle!,This is a great puzzle from Melissa and Doug. Their floor puzzles are very durable and fairly priced and this is no acception. It's also a great picture to make a puzzle out of because it doesn't have a lot of blank space and not a lot of color repetition. My 3yo daughter learned how to spell all the planets with this one and loves to pick out which are which. Definitely would recommend this one for kids.
5,Educational and fun,"This puzzle is a favorite with my grandson (5 years old) He got it as a gift at 4 years old and can put it together himself. The colors are great, he liked it so much I purchased the dinosaur and underwater floor puzzles for him for Christmas. They are a toy that keeps being used! Highly recommend!"
3,Pacific NW ad pioneer in his own words,"Years ago I worked for Botsford, Constantine & Gardner, a fine ad agency that came to the marketplace in Seattle with a batch of energetic, entrepreneurial admen in their history. Among its founders, C.P. Constantine. Years later I dug up his book that had all but vanished from memory among some of his many spiritual heirs in the Pacific Northwest ad business. His story read like a screenplay written in the era of Gable and Greenstreet. His experiences still provide a study guide that today's advertising and marketing types should carry in their hip pockets. Yes, the language and some of the style would be outdated today, but that shouldn't diminish the value of the content or Constantine's contribution.I wish I could have been there to witness some of that first hand.But then I would have had to forego some of my own experiences and hard won discoveries, like these:Postcards. Little Letters From Life"
3,"Good, but dated","This is a good book with some good ideas, and it is cross-referenced so that you know what kind of business each idea involves. There are some ideas that I did not think of, along with additional resources listed.The only problem is that the book is very dated now. This book was born when the internet was still gaining in popularity. One of the job descriptions suggests that companies are still unsure of how the internet can best be used.I'd love to see an undated version of this book. Until then, it's a good, but limited resource for my needs."
3,It was O.K.,"I purchased this book over seven months ago and didn't have much time to read it then. I work for a software company and was looking for a way to use what I have went to school for, for 5 years to recieve my BS/MS in Computer Science and again another year for a PH.D to make money of my own.When I read the book I was really upset by the fact that it did not provide alot of help for a beginner who was just starting their own business.I also gathered from the book that it was catering to a certain class of people. ie educated, money, and alot of time to spend.The resources that they provided half of them were not any good.And those that were they had no idea of what you were talking about.As far as I was concerned the book was O.K. but it could have been better.Ebony"
2,Basically a summary of other books,I bought this book before I looked at the print date. This book is mostly a compilation of information from other books. This book is only useful as an index to those books. Anyone who is interested in starting a business will find this book otherwise useless and outdated.
4,The story of 09/11/2001.,"This is the story of the attack on our country on 9/11/01. The story goes all the way back to the late 1980's and originates in Afghanistan. Berstein does a good job of describing how bin Laden and his group of thugs got their grounding in the basics of terrorism. Not only bin Laden but some of the other members (Atta) are described in their early life.Along with the story of the terrorists, there are stories of some of the victims of 09/11/01. Bernstein does a good job in describing their lives, so we know what America lost in this attack. Unlike other journalists, Berstein gives reasons why the FBI/CIA did not pick up on the attack.This is a good summary of the attacks and the reasons they originated. The title sums up the surprise Americans felt when the attack came."
2,Pass This One Up,"I've been reading everything I can on 9/11 lately, and sorry to say this one was one of the worst. I just find it terribly written and organized.There is way too much on the terrorists, not enough on the victims. Too often we get a really cliched paragraph review of a life ""So and so went to college here and loved to eat muffins in the morning, and then they died."" I felt it was just superficial and trivilizing to the dead.It is well-meaning, but this author is a reporter, not a novelist, and it really shows. I couldn't even finish.To be fair, this was written very soon after the attacks, and with time better books are coming out. For its time, i guess it's ok, but there are now much much better 9/11 books out there."
2,"Facts, yes, but lacking meaning","There are lots of cold, hard facts in this book, which is great for those interested in statistics. For people who want a view of the day beyond the numbers, dates and times, to really understand the terror, hopelessness & agony of the day, this book will disappoint. The horror of September 11th was not the destruction of walls of the Pentagon or the tumbling of buildings, it was the agony of loss, the simultanenous, murder thousands. It's the thoughts that imagination creates and the pressing, persistent questions that peek out of forcibly supressed memories. The horror is the public murder and the agony is the private, unknown details. This book misses those things. The author recounts ""things"" well in the method of a reporter taking notes, but misses the importance of Sept. 11th, which is maintaining its meaning."
5,Absolutely fantastic!,"I've had mine for over five years adn it's stil in perfect working order! Great for stiff, tight or just tired backs and necks. I'm glad I got one!"
3,hard read,"You have to be very science minded to read this book. It is technical and small print, I could not get through it but that is just me."
1,Scientific mimicry: Re-establishing ignorance in America,"A religious fanatic on our local school board, who is always crowing about ""The Lord,"" but who knows absolutely nothing about evolutionary theory or the scientific method, wants to see this book included in high school science curriculums around the country. He is not a stupid man, just deeply ignorant and stubbornly irrational, a condition which he would like to share with every citizen in America. Judging from the number of positive reviews this book has received his quest for a universally witless nation may not have far to go."
1,Reasons not to believe,"What can I say except that anyone with much knowledge of the scientific method, basic logic or modern findings in science will see that Scientific Creationism is an obvious attempt to force the data to fit the model. When this cannot be done, simply deny the data. This same material has been covered many time before, and there is nothing new here. This is really too bad. I was raised a conservative christian, and for years have attempted to find real evidence that faith is true, or at least basically right. Unfortunately, this and similar books do nothing but reenforce my current belief that the faith of my earlier life is simply wrong."
1,Do people really believe this?,"Illogical, filled with wishful thinking, and intellectually dishonest. This book either seeks to avoid or spin evidence as much as the Clinton White House staff."
3,"Good Ideas, But Dated","I like all of Henry Morris's books. This one is a fine read if you are already a committed Christian who believes in Creation. However, because of it's age (1974), it has become quite outdated in some of the science it uses. There have been a lot of new discoveries in science since it was written. Though this is a good book, there are more current ones out there on creationism that would be a better investment of your book dollars."
1,Great title if you like oxymorons,"I'm simply and constantly amazed at the subterfuge and irrational thinking that defenders of ID, creationism, or whatever they want to call it on any given day go through in order to rationalize what they want to believe in the face of overwhelming evidence."
1,"There's no ""science"" in ""Scientific Creationism""","Like fake jewelry, the slick, well-marketed pablum of groups like Answers in Genesis and the Institute for Creation Research, turns out to be, on closer inspection, a poor imitation of the real thing. Instead of well-reasoned and researched scientific theories, we're offered pseudo-scientific ""creation theories"" that utilize neither rational thought nor the scentific method. Such ""theories"" are religious/philosophical in nature and have NO place in any science classroom. True scientific theories are subject to falsification, but the so-called creation theories of Morris and co. AREN'T,... due to their being based on theological presuppositions and not on any physical evidence. Hard to believe I used to eat this stuff up."
2,Shows no more intelligence than the 1974 edition,"Once again Morris displays his ignorance of what science is. You should start with a hypothsis, run experiments or observations to validate or invalidate your hypothesis, and eventually this leads to a theory or to the wastecan. Morris's method is the reverse: You start out with an ""fact"" based on your faith then gather up any evidence which supports it and shut out all which invalidates it, all the while carelessly using the word ""proof""! I am sad for the people who may be reading this book who don't notice the blatant illogic. Morris is guilty of muddying peoples vision in their search to find God."
5,Try and Disprove This One Leftists!,"There is absolutely NO evidence that evolution has ever occured, and this book provides more than enough FACTS that support Creationism. If you want to go to Heaven, embrace this book, otherwise I'm sure SATAN will be very interested in your views on ""evolution"" (more like ""evoLIEtion hahahahaha!) This is a Christian Nation AND a Christian Planet. If you know anyone who sends their children to atheistic public schools where they teach children how to be homosexual communist evolutionists, get them out and give them the truth! Their souls will thank you."
5,Repentance - An Awesome Responsibility and Privilege,"Richard Owen Roberts' ""Repentance"" is a must read for all who desire to know God personally, in the way that God desires. Through reading Roberts' book I have come to better understand 'repentance' as the 'gift of God' yet the responsibility of all humanity. Owen's text is not a sit down read through encounter but a book that takes the reader, willing to repent, on a journey to a closer, better relationshiop with God through Christ Jesus our Lord. Thank you Richard Owen Roberts for a job well done."
2,Ok...,"Although the subject of repentance is discussed quite a lot, somehow, I just did not connect. I read some of the book, but, I feel no clear definition of repentance was given. Perhaps it was the writing style. I don't know...I almost never hear the word repentance in sermons or in church. When I do happen to hear it, the meaning seems to just imply ""stop."" But, the word is much fuller in meaning that just ""stop."" Based on my own, non-expert Greek study, the two actions associated with repent are to turn, to change one's mind.I will continue to study, and pray..."
4,repentance : the first word of the gospel.,an excellent read. one of those rare life changing books from an author who espouses the full councel of Gods Word. a book i will no doubt read and reread.
4,Outdated,"An irony of this book is in its very title. The Soviet Union last only one year past the end of the period surveyed. The book's current value is in its thoughtful survey of the many twists in the Soviet Union and China's relationship prior to 1990. A reader will catch a whiff of a bygone era. Contrasted to the book's period, the Soviet Union's breakup was a huge strategic gain for China, by immensely reducing the size of the Soviet/Russian economy relative to China's.Plus, China's economy has grown significantly since 1990, and is now heavily business oriented. The book describes a different, poorer China.An updated version of this book might be appreciated by some readers, to document the new developments."
1,"Are you people blind, dumb, or just stupid","I can't believe that everyone is making such a big deal about the TV show, it's AWFUL!!! I'm sorry to step on some toes here but it just plain sucks! I've tried watching the show several times but I can't bring myself to watch an entire episode, the special effects are horrible, the characters are all wrong, and the plots are almost nothing like the book. Take the episode 'The Reaction', first off it was Rachel who was supposed to aquire the croc. Not Cassie, Rachel! also the crocs were way to small, now I can be forgiving about that part because of the difficulty of filming with a large croc, but come on!! wake up America! Demand that the show stick true to the book series. I know I am. Fight the stupididty of TV executives! PS- sorry to make such a big deal but it's my opinion, if you don't like it email me with your own."
1,i think this book is spiritually challenged,i think this book is spiritually challenged because they don't comment on the feeling of specific characters.when i read a book i should be able to feel the characters rough feelings and not so rough feelings.i am not jubilant with this book. i am not able to expeirence the auras of the characters in the book.this book is satanized .we should live in peace with other races not have wars.and people should know if there are demon slugs taking over the earth.
4,Only Animorphs.,"The only reason it has 4 stars is becouse it's Animorphs, and Animorphs can't have less than 4 stars. I wouldn't pay for it. Sorry guy's but the show just doesn't cut it."
1,Save your money,This slim volume (18 pages) is little more than an expanded brochure. It gives only a bare description of the polygraph process and very postively promotes the technique. The book contains no information about the limitations of the polygraph technique. A much better book is Deception Detection: Winning the Polygraph Game by Charles Clifton.
2,Don't bother,"Most of this information is given to you at orientation (IRAC method, etc.). This is basically an advertisement for their Law In A Flash Flashcard series, and other Emanuel products, which they basically try to convince you that you cannot live without. For instance, in the chapter on Studying and Class Preparation, they mentioned Law in a Flash flashcard series or other Emanuel products 17 times. It got to be a bit much. Go to the Emanual website for free if you want to look at their ads and save your money."
2,Not the right version as advertised,"The seller advertised this as the version narrated by Sterling Holloway(the original voice actor for Winnie the Pooh), but this version is narrated by the Disney character Ludwig Von Drake(voice actor Paul Frees). I would not have purchased this item if I would have known that this was not the Sterling Holloway version. The narrator's voice acting and script makes a big difference for the viewer. I am very disappointed with this product."
2,Brought back memories,"I watched this as a kid, and I wanted to share it with my children. But the narrator on this version is AWFUL to listen to! He has a thick accent and is difficult for me to understand, let alone my children. I think I am going to keep looking for the version with better narration. Other than that, the story is the same."
1,LOW QUALITY VIDEO,I purchased this video for my 3yr-old.This video lacked in both:the narrator's ability to translate in descent spanish and video and sound quality.
1,"Buy something else, not this one",I should have bought something else. I bought it for my two-year old and he quickly lost interest. I also bought it for me and I quickly lost interest.
4,old fashioned sciencefiction,"with the small twist of having a society of homosexuals, the story was interesting, alittle slow in the beginning, and it gives you a sense that your getting a very brief lesson on population genetics, But IT IS still a Great ""what If"" book,and one which i enjoyed."
3,Good taste; hard to dispense,This sprinkle mix container leaves alot to be desired. Decorating cookies with 2 young girls became frustrating when the sprinkles wouldn't sprinkle out of the container very well. Had to pour them into small bowls to use. But color and variety are great and they taste good!
2,Wilton 6 Color Christmas Sprinkle Mix,I could have bought this at the local store for less and not have to wait.Bad deal! Don't buy and waste your money but especially time.

5,LOVE DON JOHNSON!,Loved this season.love don johnson anyway.hooked again.cant wait til i can get all 6 seasons.i love this show and wished the remaing seasons would hurry and come to dvd.
4,Good season mainly because quite a few of the episodes involve Nash's daughter Cassidy.,"In the first episode of the season Cassidy starts to date Evan Cortez, The Great Escape: Nash must race against time to save Cassidy who has been taken hostage by para-military activists, Night Train: Nash and the others are held hostage on a train while Cassidy and her mother spend the night in the hospital,Road Work: Nash and Joe try to keep a witness alive and Cassidy has to find a replacement date for a dance, Gunplay: Cassidy is accidentally shot with a bullet by a kid selling a gun at school and Nash must track down the culprit and Rampage: Cassidy poses nude for a safe sex campaign."
4,Nash lives,"I was surprise Nash Bridges was availabe on DVD. I thought the end of the show wasthe end of Nash, but in this day and age everything ends up for sale. Again I gavethese to my son for Christmas and he was delighted. I still think it's a cheesyshow but it had its' moments and it's a way to see Don Johnson when he was stillyoung enough and fit enough to play a smart-alec cop. Cheech make the show watchable.Some of the story lines are interesting as I recall. I did watch it when on TV sowhat can I say."
4,Out of order,Nash Bridges has all ways been one of my favorite show's.I was very happy when it was released on dvd.The only complaint i have about the second season is the show's are not in order.When u watch the seond season u will see what i am talking about.
3,coffee mug,This is just a nice heavy mug. No insulation mean hot hands and cold coffee. I will give it to a relative and stick with my old Alladin.Halfbreed
2,Highwave Original Hotjo travel 16oz coffee mug-black,"The mug was labeled as 16oz but, when I received it, it is a 14oz. Seller said Amazon had it listed wrong, that the mugs only come in 14oz, I found bigger but there wasn't time to do a redo, it really upset me that I paid for quick ship and the item was wrong, had no time to correct it."
5,The Best Travel Mug,"This is the most wonderful travel mug. It is also great for an office or anywhere you want to take it. I put mine in the microwave and the dishwasher, and it has lasted for several years. Don't know if that is recommended or not, but you can do it, and the mug will do fine. The top is very secure, the handle comfortable, best insulation you can get without a special liner. Also, comes in lots of great colors. If you buy this, I don't think you will be disappointed."
1,TRAVEL MUG,"As a traditional coffee mug It Is fine,but for travel It Is terrible. You have to be careful when you fill It that the liquid Is not too high In the mug. The top protrudes Into the mug so when you ""lock"" It In, It makes the liquid overflow. Tossed the lid and use It as a regular coffee mug."
4,Descendants of Johann Bittner & Maria Anna Reisewitz of Schlesien Germany,"This is a fabulous one-of-a-kind resource for descendants of Johann Bittner & Anna Maria Reisewitz of Leuppusch, Kreis Grottkau, Schlesien, Germany (located s/se of Breslau/Wroclaw and s/sw of the towns formerly known as Lieppe, Michelau and Lowen). Today, Schlesien (aka Selesia) is in southern Poland, and Leuppusch has been renamed Lubcz. This history follows four of the Bittner children, Johanna, Johann/John, Franz/Frank, and Herman Eduard, through their emigration to Marquette, Michigan very late in the 19th century. All but Frank, who finally settled in Chilton, Wisconsin, remained there for the rest of their lives. While this resource is an amateur self-publication, it includes some invaluable census and emigration records, pictures and histories of several generations of the Johann Bittner family."
4,Vintage Hawaiian Music Classic,"Johnny Coco enjoyed a pretty good career in the music scene of the Polynesian Tiki craze that swept America in the 50's and 60's. Sadly, today there is precious little of that music preserved on compact disc. Thankfully, ""The Exotic Sounds of the Hawaii Kai"" was released on CD. This is a live album recorded at one of the great Polynesian night spots fo the era, the Hawaii Kai. The album is full of easy Hawaiian classics tinged with bossa nova beats, lap steel guitar and Johnny Coco's velvety crooning. The feel is less ""hula girls in grass skirts"" and more of a posh supper club. This is a fine vintage Hawaiian album and even more special since it is part of precious few titles from that genre available on CD today."
2,KINDLE VERSION OUT OF DATE!,The kindle version is the 2004 verson of the Wire...I really want to get this book but I am overseas so I rely on kindle. SO GET THIS THING UPDATED!!!!
3,good book as far as it goes,a book prepared as Wire's season three was being written so in some ways rather limited now. but comments by Simon and the principle writers are all interesting and basically informative. useful if you want to research a few of the ideas behind the show by the people who made many of the formative decisions - rather than just read a fan's gushing recollections.
3,No pre-cut slots where bag mounts in compactor...,"The bags get 3 stars because they are of a good weight and do the job, but they get only 3 stars. Of all the compactor bags I've purchase previously, the others all had 4 ""slits"" cut into the plastic where they get mounted onto the pegs on the outside of the compactor drawer. This seem trivial; however, it greatly increases the amount of time necessary to change bags. With these, if you want the bag anchored to the drawer pins, one has to take the time to cut the slits themselves."
5,little boys who love tractors will love this,My grandson loves these DVDs. Everything is about tractors and this is on his level. The only downside is they are not very long and they get you by having to buy the next installments.
4,Dirt-Free Fun for Kids,"A friend of ours gave us 'All About John Deere for Kids Vol I' some time ago. Their 6 year old had out-grown it and our two year old boy was just getting into TV and DVDs. We're not farmers and are no way mechanically minded at all but our son seems to have picked up an inetrest in trucks & tractors from somwhere (is it genetic?). Anyway, he actually wore out that DVD playing it so much (mis-handling more-like!). In searching for a replacement, I came across the 4x DVD set on Amazon and bought it.These DVDs are great fun. They appeal very much to the 2-4 year demographic and have great visuals. They also seem to improve vocabulary (my two year old now knows the diference between excavators, tractors etc.). For an insight into a particular way of life and enough big machines to keep any young boy happy, I can recommend this series. Knocked off a star for the set being a tad repeditive and advertising merchandise on later discs."
5,Loves John Deere,"I bought this as a Christmas present for our 2 1/2 year old because he loved taking them out from the library but they weren't always there. He absolutely loves watching them and has learned a lot. He takes what he sees on the video and puts it to use in how he plays. He has a lot of the machines that he sees on the video and will get the ones out that are being shown on the tape. He loves his ""green tractor movie"" and so it was definately worth it. I suggest renting it from the library if you can to see you your child would like it."
2,Two Thumbs Way Down,"Ok, first of all, the title & some of the specs refer to some HDTV monitor by LG, but the picture and some of the other info seems to be referring to the DVD player pictured.I have the DVD player, it didn't even last me a year, and it wasn't like I even used it that much. I paid around $70 for it and they want to fix it for $69 + shipping. I'm very disappointed with this purchase, hoping LG was a good buy, but in this case, it was two thumbs way down. And when I tried playing homemade DVDs, it would intermittently freeze or play very very choppily. Buy something else."
2,Failed Fusion Attempt,"I'm sad to report that this is the only Dizzy Gillespie album I've heard that let me down. Way down. Diz takes a stab at early 70's jazz-rock fusion...an admirable and promising venture. And while most of what Gillespie has touched in his career has turned to gold, this stuff has no shimmer. Repetetive riffs, simplistic chord progressions, square rhythms, and studio fade-outs predominate. ""The Real Thing"" even dabbles with ""flower-power"" sounds and lyrics that will make you cringe. The ""Portrait of Jenny"" album is somewhat better, with a smaller group stretching out on some mellow jams... but while it isn't unpleasant, it's often very dull. The live ""Giants"" session returns to a more traditional acoustic combo playing mostly standard tunes, but the performance is poorly recorded and uninspiring overall. Beware: For Gillespie completists only!"
4,good book for FACTS Static models(includes Matlab code),"Dear Power_community,I hope this book is good collection of STEADY STATE (power flow) models of all major FACTS controllers for balanced and unbalanced(3 ph) Powerflow studies,Optimal powerflow studies. The authors presented the FACTS models in simple and effective way(their research work from 1990)and also added Matlab code in the book which is an added dimension.I hope in the next edition authors can extend this Static models by adding FACTS DYNAMIC models and will present to the Power_community. and i think it will be better if code is given in the CD/Floppy rather than printing in the book.Yalavarthi"
2,Ipod Cover + Armband,"This Ipod accessory is definitely useful. The velcro, elastic strap is nice, but the skin case attracts a lot of dust and must be cleaned a few times. In addition, the hole for the headphones to go through is also a pain in the butt to deal with. Overall, this product gets the job done, but not with any style or grace."
1,Do not buy,"The day I bought this the silicon skin case ripped. It is still useable, but it really dulls the color of my ipod mini, in fact it makes it look downright dirty, traps dust and lint in between the case and the ipod. I am going to buy a new case, because I hate this one so much. Waste of $25."
1,"Right music, wrong disc.","Great, great music. But why buy this old release when you can get the same music with extra material & better sound on _Nefertiti, the Beautiful One Has Come_?"
1,Easily breaks,The item broke after 3 uses. It seems to be quite fragile...needs to be made of a stronger material.
3,"2"" bowl sander kit.","I didn't have problems with the stem breaking like others. the foam is starting to separate though. Used it to sand 2 scrolled out bowls and a few other projects. Made light work of it, not really made for allot of heavy sanding. I will look for a different one but I would buy it again if a better one is not found."
3,Not much help,"Pretty much contains a lot of recycled material in simplistic form from other, more detailed, sources. Not enough meat to feed a Merlin (small raptor)."
4,Thoughtful and intelligent writing,"I thoroughly enjoyed this work by the granddaughter of Italy's FIAT founder, Eduardo Agnelli (her brother was the well-groomed successor Gianni Agnelli).It's always a little surprising to hear how simply most aristocratic and royal families live, it's considered a sign of manners and good breeding. And rather refreshing in this age of excess, where rich and poor alike seem determined to set a new standard for greed and self-indulgence. She lived in tumultuous times (Mussolini, WWII), but she tells her story from a strictly personal viewpoint: her family troubles, her experiences in school, her months of nursing during the war. She was a sensitive and intelligent woman who went on to achieve great things in Italy, a country where women still seem to be 6 paces behind the men. Thoughtfully-told recollections, if you like intelligent writing, you will likely appreciate this one."
5,great book,This book arrived in perfect condition with the cd even. Great illustrations and warm story for the season. My children have already heard it a couple times since we got it and they are so tuned into it.
4,good book,I read this book on christmas day. it's a nice family read and will make a great edition to our home.
4,This is a great Christmas Story!!,"I know the work ""Christmas"" is taboo for many, but this is a great Christmas story. A man still mourning the loss of his wife learns to open up his heart to young boy curious about his carvings as well as the boy's mother who shows kindness. The carver begins to reluctantly make a nativity set, and in so doing, he realizes that he still loved by God, the boy, and the mother."
5,The whole family loved it,"It was hard reading this book to my kids, because it made me cry, but we all loved it.The book explores the importance of human relationships in giving meaning to life. It also deals with how people recover from loss and overcome adversity.Despite it's being a children's picture book, it's definitely meaty material. It deals with a world that is not at all like a fairy tale, where people are struggling with real problems. I like that. I like letting kids see that happiness doesn't necessarily come from being a rich person or having everything go right. Happiness comes from working hard and reaching out to others.I recommend this book most heartily."
5,The Christmas Miracle of Jonathan Toomey with CD,This was the best book in the world. I love the pictures and my girls loved the story!!! Would definitely recommend it!!!l
5,So Positive!,This is a wonderful book for children. The advice is invaluable for helping anyone achieve a positive and can do attitude.
2,I DareYou!,"This book came as a recommendation to add to my library, after reading it I felt that it will require additionalreadings."
3,I Dare You (MP3 CD) Version,"This I DARE YOU (MP3 CD) version will NOT PLAY ON A CD PLAYER. IT ONLY PLAYS on a computer.I was a little disappointed since I purchased it to play in the car and on a portable cd player. It only plays on the computer disk player. I'll have to download it myself to an audio MP3 format. It must have been recorded as a DATA file. The narrator is a little momo-toned and I was very surprised that I zoned out on a self-help type CD. There are 14 chapters that run anywhere from 2 minutes 16 seconds to 26 minutes 14 seconds. Some are short, most are average 5-10 minutes."
2,Poor organization and flow,"This book was a difficult read. The content isn't particularly difficult, but the book's organization and scattered subject matter made it difficult to get through. Though I read the book cover to cover, I often felt I was rereading material.For example, his 21-page treatment of ""Players- Hackers, Crackers, etc."" conveyed no more information than did his 6-page overview of them in his Introduction. Even so, I have the distinct impression that the most he's ever seen of a ""hacker"" is on TV.My background in this topic has been purely educational (that is to say I've taken 1 forensics class) and I have to agree that there are several books that cover the topic more clearly and more in depth than this one.My recommendation... go to your local library or book store and spend 30 minutes reading the Introduction, you won't be missing much."
2,what's new here?,"There is nothing in this book that has not been covered 50 times before.Interesting read, but there are gigabytes of similar FEEE data on the same topic on the net.So why bother?"
1,Garbage,"If you need to know anything about forensics, DON'T read this book.Poorly written and full of errors.Avoid at all costs!"
1,Poor book,This is a book by a person who clearly has no real world experience in the word of digital forensic investigations.While the information is relevant; it should not be used as an authoritative text.There are much better titles and this should be used as a text of last resort.
3,one hot roaster!!!!!,"I bought this roaster to use as a hot pot, because the hot pot slow cookers on the market today cook things to fast...they boil the dickens out of everything...they are just to hot even on the low setting..this nesco is pretty good,because it has a variable heat knob but.... its quite dangerous..the outside of it gets so hot, could get a nasty burn if your not careful..even when its turned down to slow cook...the outside is really hot.you need to tell the family that she's a hot pot and don't touch... wish they would have put a little insulation or a heat barrier in the side of the unit to insulate it some....other than that it is a great little unit.. so remember she's hot and she'll make you trot, so touch er' not."
3,Not bad,"This roaster/oven is ok. Quality is good for the price. Easy to clean. You DO have to break it in. It smokes a lot. I let it bake outside for 2 hours on high and it was fine.My first meal was a turkey breast and it was great. Very moist. I was disappointed that the somewhat cheesy grill insert thing barely held up to a turkey breast then the lid wouldn't completely close. I used a vegetable steamer insert instead, problem solved.Second meal was chicken wings and it was ok.Cooker does come with an excellent recipe book with a lot of great ideas in it.If you really need a roaster oven then go for it but I don't think it's a must have."
2,JUNK!!!,I bought this for my daughter's Wax museum book report on Amelia Earhart. The scarf was about 14 inches and just a piece of ribbon with a bit of fringe sewn on. We had to buy another scarf. The hat part is made out of velvety fabric not at all what I expected. I was expecting a vinyl. The goggles were pretty bad too.
