2,What Happened?,"It took me many months trying to find ""somethin' to blaze to"" and ""rated g"" (T.A.'s first two albums) after finally finding them I was completly satisfied. Each of those albums would have gotten 5 stars, but this one however is another story. I realize groups from '93 had to change their style (no more chronic style beats) to accomodate the new sounds of '97, but other than world war 3 the beats were unimaginative, boring and sounded like anyone could produce them. T.A. had amazing lyrics for gangsta rappers back then, but in '97 you had to come up with some thought provoking material which T.A. couldn't do. Bad lryics with bad beats equals bad album. Sorry for the knock on this one guys, but thanks a lot for your first two albums if your reading this."
4,true PLAYAZ,"I WILL BE COMPLETELY HONEST, I HAVENT GIVEN THIS ALBUM A LOT OF LISTENING TO BUT, THE TRACK PLAYAZ BY ITSELF GETS THIS CD A RATING OF 4 STARS. VERY NICE TRACK AND CARRIES THE ALBUM TO THE END. FIND THIS ALBUM AND BUMP THIS TRACK. DONT GET ME WRONG, WITH A TRACK THIS HARD ON IT, HOW COULD IT NOT HAVE OTHER TIGHT JAMS TO FIND."
2,May work for telephone or fax.,"I, stupidly, purchased this as a splitter for an Ethernet phone connection to connect two computers. It does not work with computer phone connections, even when one computer is shut down. It kills the connection for both computers until you unplug one of them.Before I wasted $8.80 to receive this $2.49 (Retail Value) plug it would have been nice if the product description had stated that fact. ""Use for data/PBX applications"" is not a correct use for this product. A standard phone or fax line ""may"" work with this signal splitter, but it is not for data transmission."
3,"No opinion on sound quality, just aesthetics",Cute and teenage-looking. These were bigger than I expected them to be. Like the size of tennis balls all the way round. I was thinking they'd be at least an inch smaller in diameter than that. Decided to gift them to a teenager I know and so didn't open them and therefore have no opinion on their sound quality.
5,The most awesome pair of little speakers and so affordable!,I've bought lots of stuff from Amazon but this is my first time to write a review of something. That's how pleased and excited I am about this purchase! I bought these little speakers so that I (and my co-workers) could listen to my iPod at work. These are going to be perfect! Great design and compact enough for my desk. And I love the low price since it's just something for work. Note: There is no seperate volume control on the speakers. They plug directly into your iPod and you must use iPod's volume control. This means the sound won't go up high so don't buy these if you're looking to play music really loud. It's perfect for me though since I'm using these in a work environment. Another note: No outside power is required for these speakers. You don't have to deal with batteries or outlets. It draws it's power from your device.
3,Little Speakers,"These cute little speakers are as nice as it gets for portable speakers with no external power source. They sound a little ""small"" but the quality of the sound is not bad. I wouldn't recommend them to play live performances where the sound isn't super crisp, but on most music recordings, I think they are more than adequate. Not too expensive, and they have a normal headphone jack, so they might be used with many different music players. They are a little bigger than I expected, but they do have a small footprint, so they fit well on a desk or counter."
3,"Not very loud, good for indoor use only","I hooked this up to my iPod shuffle. It works great indoors, but outside it does not get very loud. If you turn the volume above middle range on the shuffle the audio starts to cut in and out. Sounds like a cd skipping. If you turn the volume back down, it works fine. Basically, you're getting what you pay for in size and sound."
3,Could take them or leave them,"Like other reviewers have said, these are too weak.Pros:1. Very, very cute!2. Light weight3. Don't need external power4. Very portableCons:1. Too weak2. Larger than what I thought they would be3. Sound is tingy4. Cord is very shortI've had these for a while now, and I was excited about them at first. But in the end I didn't use them very much because I couldn't hear anything unless the room was very quiet."
4,Great Little Speakers,"I really like this set of speakers, and they are a great value for the money. I tried to do lots of research and comparisons before I finally decided to buy these, and I'm glad I did. I bought them to put in my home office (and I sometimes put them in the bathroom to sing along with music while I'm in the shower). They work really well in small spaces like these, and they're extremely easy to move around, especially since they don't have to be near an outlet. The maximum volume with my iPod Shuffle doesn't sound distorted, although obviously it's not the crystal clear sound you'd get from a larger pair of powered speakers. Overall, I'm very happy, and I'd buy them again."
1,Do not use with laptop!!!,"I bought these for easy one plug in solution for laptop speakers. the laptop speakers are better and louder. These speakers worked better in my ipod, although still only load enough if you are quietly listening to music at your work desk (that is where they are going). I am going to try usb speakers now for the laptop."
4,Good little speakers,"I bought these speakers to use on my desk, at work. They're great! They sound good, are easy to use, and I can take them anywhere. I highly recommend them, especially for the price."
5,"Excellent book, very helpful.","If you own a business, you have to have this book. It explains everything from employee compensation to the home office deduction. What's great is I find myself referring to it on a regular basis for both simple questions (can I deduct this?) to complex questions (depreciation expense).I would recommend this book to anyone with a business."
2,Not very revealing information,"This is a very basic book that unearths nothing we don't already know. Wow, a SEP-IRA is deductible? And so is health insurance and advertising? C'mon... give me something I can use!There is nothing in this book that can't be found for free at a number of sites. In fact, Quicken.com may be more detailed, and its free.Unless you were born 2 days ago, and started a business yesterday, this book will reveal very little."
1,This book is decieving like Gary Zukov,"This book is very sad since this strange little man doesn't know much astral travelling.He tells that the astral world is made up of your thoughts and fantasies and the higher realms are made up of humans elavated thoughts about heaven.Thus,implicated the thought in your head that your astral travels are ILLUSORY.In fact they are of seperate creation and is an insult to fearies/nature spirits/angels/God by saying they are not real.This book is bad.This goldberg man reduces the spiritual art to nothing but a form of childrens dream.This book won't help you to leave your body either,it has methods that he expects you to simply master.Also he does not tell how to find you guides or friends but tells you instead when you do find them.I would have refund this book if I didn't leave in my salon floor for a month."
2,Interesting but...,"Some interesting thoughts, but not at all like real astral travel, and don't get this if you expect to learn astral travel, or progress already existing projection talent. look into adventures beyond the body by william buhlman (spelling may be wrong) if you want to begin astral travel."
1,Deceiving the Masses,"This book is riddled with fallacies and very poorly organized. Although some of the ideas were interesting, it seemed like the author just made everything up! It's amazing that something like this actually got published.I think this paragraph about the author's ""trip"" to one of the astral planes speaks for itself.""Suddenly the figure of the evil Darth Vader came out of the woods... My astral sense of humor was in attendance, as I created a can of spinach, opened it with miniature lightning bolts, and consumed this can of power immediately.Just like Popeye, my fists grew in size, and I punched Darth Vader right through his helmet...""How stupid does the author really think we are? This obviously reflects his opinion of the readers of his book.If you want to expand spiritually, I suggest reading something by Thich Nhat Hanh, or any author that knows what they're writing about."
4,Teacher & parent rewiews Reading Maze,"As a early childhood educator & special ed. teacher for more than 15 years, I find that children, especially those with reading problems, like the computer. It offers a patient, fun approach to difficult tasks.I have used Reading Maze for several years and the children really like it. Given an extensive software library to choose from, it is a frequent selection.The game play is easy to master and the levels increase in difficulty slowly enough to foster good feelings and quickly enough to allow a challenge.I recommend this title for ages 3-7 or 8 depending on ability.I use it with my own kids at home aged 2 and 4..."
3,So so catnip,"My cats don't go crazy for this brand of catnip. It's very expensive and a very small bag, and it seems like it's not nearly as strong as catnip I buy for much less money."
3,Sweet Stories About Fanny,"Fanny is a young girl...who happens to be a pear. Her best friend is Margarita, a banana. The book is divided into short stories such as where Fanny dislikes the way she looks, but realises she'll never be tall and skinny like a banana, because she is and always will be a pear. Another story is about Fanny taking a bath and the odd things one thinks of in the bathtub. The stories are of unusual subjects, with unusual illustrations (how often do you see a pear taking a bubble bath?) with no rhyming text. The full page illustrations are sweet and simple with text looking and reading more like modern poetry. It's a sweet, quirky and feminine book for young girls."
1,Thats it?,I love buying import CDs and getting extra tracks and having that extra something that most people dont have. Not only was the somg aweful the price is ridiculous. For almost 70 bucks this is insane. I was actually expecting something extra in the packaging like KISS sometimes does or Def Leppard. Go buy the american release and spend the extra money on the new Billy Idol and new Judas Priest and still have money over for the new Def Leppard Rock of Ages CD.
4,66.99 for 1 Extra new Motley Crue song?????? Come On,"i think 66.99 is outrageous, should be 24.99 if anything, cuase only different between the Japan version of Red White & Crue , and the US version of Red White & Crue is the last song on the 2nd Disc ""I'm A Liar (And That's The Truth)My only question is this , why didn't just put ""I'm a liar (And That The Truth) on the US copy of this cd, since it's a NEW Crue tune."
4,Good protection.,"I bought a black DS for my son for Christmas. The black one is very prone to smears and fingerprints, and given that my son is 7, I also wanted to protect the DS a little. This ""skin"" is a hard shell that covers the top and bottom of the DS. After I ordered this I saw a soft skin at Walmart that I probably would have preferred from a style perspective. The soft one also had protection for the inside of the DS.Having a black DS, this white skin is not the most fashionable (the black sides of the DS still show), but my son loves Mario and he's happy.All in all it's a good product."
1,Not to good!!!,"The hard cover fits well but the strick paper that atached the protector to the DS is not good, my son put it on to his DS came off a couple of weeks later."
3,"nice protector, wish it secured a bit better","Overall the cover is nice and has protected the finish of the DS well, but, the sticky tape on it stopp'ed sticking after 3 months so only the snaps hold it in, and they slip every so often.Also which it covered the back end of the DS for added protection."
4,Does it's job.,"I purchased this to protect the smooth shiny finish on my Nintendo DS. I am only using the top cover since I thought the bottom cover made it comfortable to hold the unit. Besides not using the bottom part, this serves it's purpose and you have to admit it is cute with all the Mario Bros characters on it.It does state that you can reuse it after removing it. I have not tried that it yet but it states the adhesive can be become sticky again if you add water to the strips."
1,Not what I thought,"This was a waste of money.... I actually opened it and put it in the trash. Unfortunate, but I had opened it all the way to find out it wasn't what I thought. It is a plastic cover with adhesive strips to attach to your DSLite, but who wants to put adhesive to your brand new expensive electronic. They say it is a skin, but that is the worst expressive word to use for this item. Sorry, nothing good to say about this item."
2,Boring,"I was really looking forward to this book, hoping to get a real glimpse into rock lives, but there is very little offered. Mostly the women just analyze the relationships and don't offer any juicy tidbits. If you're looking for outrageous tales of rock star excess - this is not it."
1,Yawn Yawn,I keep accidentally ordering this book. It's not what I had in mind. Did not care for it and now have 2 copies.
4,To Mr. Westfall,"Swifts ""A Modest Proposal"" was a well written glimpse of what the future would be like. It was written in the 1700s and presents disturbing views of what to do about homeless individuals and people in general. It is surprising that a lot of what the book predicted, as a means to prevent those horrific circumstances came true. In the ""Modest Proposal"" It presented a terrible vision of what may happen in the future if humans in general would not refrain from treating each other like animals. A lot of it's predicitons came true.It presents disturbing views because it's sole purpose is to disturb us, so we do not repeat these terrible acts of torture in real life. It is hard to acknowlege the fact that a lot of these acts of human torture are practiced in the world today. I recommend this book be read in order to understand and prevent future torture in society today."
3,Works ok,"This does the basis that I was hoping for, but Radio Shack's house model is much better and cheaper.This is USB powered, which can be nice, but doesn't split and requires power (not passive). The blue LED looks cheap. The remote doesn't do enough.But it functions as a dock."
5,More fun than expected,Reaches distant views. More fun than I expected. Two focus adjustments. Shaking is tolerable. Any binoculars that are over 10x will shake.
3,Good for the price.,"These are great binocs UNLESS you have great expectations. For the price and considering they are not fog or water proof, they can't be beat. Don't figure on using them in the field. They are for looking out windows or vehicles, and that's what I use them for. Good value IF you understand their limits."
1,Yuck!,"I don't understand how some people can say that it's easy to use. I gave up and bought Magix, which really is easy and MUCH MUCH more fun!!"
3,Cakewalk Music Creator 2003,"Well, I tried very hard to use this software but it was just too ""cranky"". It isn't intuitive and I suffered through too many crashes using Windows XP. It's usable but not much fun. I suggest you look elsewhere."
2,It's not as easy as it loox!,"I bought it thinkin' that it would help me with my band and stuff, but it needs to be alot more simpler. I think the MIDI and the Audio part need to be separated more. I can't get any sound to come through my speakers!Shock on,SeAwEeD"
1,poor excuse for a co2 pellet gun,folks yes it looks great! all else stops there. This company will toss you aside once the gun is paid for.
2,a malfunction,when this gun arrived i noticed when fired it leaked gas around where it was to close tight and i notified GAMO and they wanted me to pay to have it shipped back to them. left me with a bad taste to the product but then i contacted the seller who paid to have it shipped back and has a new one on the way they were very helpful and wasted no time in helping me with my problem by providing me with a pick up label and have resolved the problem for me and i will continue to buy from them.
2,Fix for breech seal!!,"Pt-80 great to shoot when it works. Problem is breech seal goes quickly. A design flaw by Gamo. I tried to order breech seal told I needed to send gun in to get fixed, yeah right for a rubber o-ring. I think Not!!! I came up with a fix to keep you shooting. Get some 1/4"" neoprene or vinyl tubing,cut to fit and you are done. A fix that works great, No thanks to Gamo. I would not buy another Gamo product again after this experience."
2,Not so geat,I bought this gun because it had good reviews from certain online air gun stores. It looks and feels good but the pellets get caught in the chamber. Maybe because they are plastic. It wouldn't turn enough and the pellet would hit the barrel before it was properly line up for a discharge. I took it back 3 times and they all had the same problem. The first one I had worked for the longest amount of time but the other 2 didn't work right out of the box. Not every pellet would get caught but 2-4 would be in the chamber after shooting 8 rounds. Also sometimes the chamber wouldn't even turn. I finally exchanged for a Walther cp-sport for $15 more and it is a much better gun for about the same price. The way the co2 cartridge is loaded and how the chamber(made of metal) is loaded is just more realistic. I have had no problems with the sport. Go with the sport.
3,pt80 review,the trigger is over 8pounds and that sucks for accuracy. I made a new trigger return spring and got the pull wieght to just under 5#. trigger pull is too long. other then that Its pretty accurate at 20ft. if it werent for the horrible trigger and lack of usa support it would be a great pistol.
1,Same problem blowing gas cylinders,"As with the other reviews, just blew 2 gas cylinders loading them into the Gamo PT80. Wish I had read the reviews first."
1,Plain & Simple - these do NOT stick!!!,"Plain & Simple - these do NOT stick!!!Tried several different sizes of this brand of bandages thinking I would ""save money"" compared to Johnson & Johnson. NOPE! Based on reviews from one of the sizes and had high hopes. NONE of the different sizes stick very well, nor do they last (fray easily as well .... but then, they don't stay on long enough to really know that way).The bottom line is that these actually cost MORE compared to J&J;'s if you need a bandaid that sticks longer than about a couple of hours. No, I do not have any interest in J&J;, no stock, etc!Sorry, this is just the truth on this brand's products!"
1,Too expensive for what it gives,"I was really curious about this book, but what a delusion when it was in my mailbox. Just some pretty 3d drawings and nothing more. Save your money and buy the books of Steven Hampton or, even better, find out the MIT guide."
5,"Beginners Will Love It, Experts Will Reference It Everyday!","Most lockpicking books throw around technical terms without explaining to the user what exactly they mean. Not so with ""The Visual Guide to Lockpicking"". Not only does the author explain what a ""sheer line"" is, he shows you with well-drawn illustrations and in-depth depictions.Beginners will find this book to be an valuable, hands-on guide with plenty of information, but experts will benefit even more. The book will likely replace every reference on their desks with this slim, knowledge-packed title.One of the very best books on lockpicking I have seen in some time. I recommend it to my customers every time they ask ""What book should I buy to learn lockpicking?""."
5,Quite useful,"Every now and then i would become interested in lockpicking and buy a new book. Unfortunately they would all talk about some shear line and wards without really explaining what they are or where they are inside the lock. I struck gold with this book since their illustrations clearly show where everything is and how it works. For the first time i was actually able to visualize the parts of my lock move. I would actually close my eyes and think of whats going on inside the lock and feel slight movements inside it. I must complain though, this book left me yearning for more, now i can't wait for the second volume."
3,"Shows lock picking very well, but nothing new.","This is a pretty good book. It isn't as thorough as the MIT guide to lock picking on the web, but the pictures are better. This is about on par with Steve Hampton's book on lock picking. They cover the same locks and the same techniques. This is a good first book to learn to pick locks with, but it is short, and it doesn't have many methods in it. I got ""How To Open Locks With Improvised Tools"" at the same time, and that has about 10 times more ways to open locks besides just picking them."
2,"Too small, Too expensive","This book has visual helps, but you would expect more and better ones for the price. You can likely learn to pick locks, but the price is too high for the quality and number of the illustrations and the size of the book. Something more should have been included in the way of where the lock picks and other materials can be purchased. This small, expensive book was disappointing to me."
1,Absolutely worthless!,"I bought these glasses and couldn't be more disappointed. I've just started playing squash with my brother. I sweat profusely and he sweats an average amount. These glasses don't fog, but sweat gets on lenses very easily. I would have to clean them after each rally! My brother didn't have to as much but he still did. After reading reviews on here by some one else who sweats alot, he recommended the head pro elitehttp://www.amazon.com/HEAD-288811-Head-Elite-Eyewear/dp/B000LH2Z1O/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&s;=apparel&qid;=1253245001&sr;=8-3]His review was positive. I was skeptical, but amazed at the results. No fog or sweat at all in the head pro elite. Bottom line: do not buy the above glasses! Terrible quality! Spend a little bit more and get much better ones. I felt compelled to write about this as the difference is amazing."
5,Couldn't be happier,Arrived just as expected. High quality 18/10 stainless steel. The only downside was that the gift box it was packaged in was a bit torn on the side.
5,Not Another JUNK Counseling book to make the author money!!!,"Adams lends a whole new look at biblical counseling, in a world full of speculation on the subject, this is a gem. You will be able to gleen alot of useful things from this book to aide in equiping you to help bind up the broken. I wish my pastor had read this book a long time ago!"
5,powerful,Mr. Jay E. Adams has surpassed himself again with this superb handbook. What clarity and depth.I would recommend it to anyone involved in counselling.
5,Competent to Counsel,This book has been such a help in revealing my own areas of improvement and I am hoping to be lead by the Holy Spirit to become a man worthy to be a counselor.
1,Competent to Counsel,"Contrary to what another reader wrote, I strongly believe in the relational aspect of counseling, and I believe the relationship between counselor and counselee is very important. I do not believe Dr. Adams' viewpoints are congruent with Scripture, and I do not recommend this book."
1,"""Christian"" judgment does harm","Mr. Adams' has neither compassion nor curiosity. He judges and directs clients by ""telling them what God requires of them.""(xiii) Mr. Adams is ""uncomfortable"" (p. 78) listening and knows what God requires of others. Everyone is a sinner. ""Unsaved counselees are neither capable of understanding God's revealed will, nor capable of doing it."" (p 68) Alternatively, in the parable of the good Samaritan (Luke 10:29-37), Jesus tells us to treat ALL others with unqualified mercy and compassion. This book is frightening. People like Mr. Adams have used Scriptures to justify slavery, the holocaust, and genocides of sinful unbelievers for centuries. I hope most people will listen instead to the compassion, mercy and suffering of Scriptures, and will not allow Mr. Adams to harm them."
5,This was a great purchase,"I was looking for a book to lead me into a new direction in counseling that involves bible based confrontational approach. I believe this book ""Competent to Counsel"" offers me it.ThanksK S Ndorleh"
5,Incredible,"It's amazing when God comforts someone, they are able to comfort others. This book focuses on the fact that the Holy Spirit is the one who counsels through the Scriptures."
1,Not what I was expecting,"I've watched the episodes on PBS before. I was looking to get those episodes for my collection of Tai Chi Training. This is not what you might expect. The 30 minute lessons have been chopped up to about 6 minutes per. For this price I was really looking to get the whole thing, not an abreviated version. Don't get this if you're looking to train with the full episodes."
5,happiness,I first bought a dvd showing a few basic moves and realized I wanted to learn all the short form. I am very happy with this set of vhs.
5,Great Instructional DVD!,"I own 5 other instructional Tai Chi DVDs. This one is my favorite. As with any new activity, frequent practice is essential. Joey Bond's style is addictive. The movements are displayed step by step repeatedly. The cadence of Bond's voice deepens Tai Chi's calming & revitalizing influence! Love it!"
2,just a leash & a belt. make your own,we got this to have hands free jogging w/ our dog. it does what is says - but the clip that attaches to the dog's collar actually broke easily once it had a strong pull. in the end this is just a leash with a belt - so you can make your own if you already have a leash and a belt.
5,Perfect fit for active owners and their dogs,"We've had this for almost a year now and this has worked flawlessly for us, it is easily adjustable which is perfect since i'm a foot taller than my wife. We've gotten it to work w/ collars, choke chains and a harness.We have use this leash for all our hikes and for running/jogging/walking and its keeps your hands free. We have a mini-dachshund so it will definitely work smaller dogs as well."
4,Very useful.,"Could have had some padding from nylon for the waist. Otherwise does its job. love the hands free comfort and my poodle walks better on it than a regular leash.Edit: After months of use especially on hikes and in the cold, this is the best thing I have bought for my dog and me! Worth more than every penny. Something every dog owner should add to their list of must haves!"
1,Waste of money,"DVD picture quality is very poor. (not ""stunning"" as advertised) Real-time 3D graphics is not impressive.(not ""awesome"" as described) In general, it is pretty boring and poorly produced software."
3,"Overall a complex book, Yet understanding in some ways.","Well, Mainly only had a little bit of trouble with the carburetor. It is an overall good book to read if in a bind with 1986 nissan sentra. its a little odd placed as in the pages but eventally you will memorize the pages or get a book mark."
2,The secrets remain,This is one of the most frustrating technical books I have ever read. It has an awful lot of good stuff in it but ultimately it fails miserably in what it tries to do. The problems are as follows:1. It can't decide whether it's a beginners guide or an expert reference book. As a result it is neither.2. It gives you all assistance short of help. Vital bits of information are missing from virtually all topics it covers. As an example: The section on Custom Dialog Boxes in chapter 3 has absolutely no mention of how to access the child control data which are of course the whole reason you would want to create a dialog in the first place. And the chapter on internet programming is a waste of good paper.
5,Surprised by the negative reviews,This book accomplishes exactly what it sets out to: Provide a clear guide for setting up and administering Windows SBS 2003. It assumes virtually no experience on the part of the reader - passing familiarity with Windows should be enough. And that is the goal of SBS 2003 - to let non-IT Pros enjoy the benefits of a Windows Server OS without spending a fortune in consultants.
1,please come up with something better,"After reading some of the other reviews I did not want to take the chance of ordering this book online, so I went in to the store to check it out for myself. I ended up not buying this book. The (negative) reviewers were right on. This book's format goes something like this: ""To open a file follow these steps: Step 1 click ""File"". Step 2 click ""Open"".... "". It goes on and on like this. Many pages are wasted handholding the reader through steps that are obvious just by looking at the screen. I was hoping for something that would actually map out and explain how Small Business Server 2003 can be set up to efficiently run a small business (i.e. mine) and take the computing hassle off my hands. I implore these authors to go back and rewrite this book from scratch with the time-pressed small business owner in mind."
4,Good book if you are the target audience.,"This book covers a LOT of ground, and includes a lot screenshots and diagrams, as well as providing a brief primer on each concept it discusses. This is not a ""got all scenarios covered"" book. But what it does cover, it does excellently. If you're relatively new to the Windows server environment, you've found your book (well, your first book at least). Every time I've had a question about my installation, I've been able to find it quickly via the table of contents (haven't even had to crack the index yet - this book is very well organized).If you're a Windows Server 2003 guru, much (but certainly not all) of the book will be irrelavent to you."
1,How To Use A Wizard,"If you want a written tutorial on how to use the Wizards in SBS 2003, then buy this book right away. If you are looking for a pratical guide for SBS 2003, shop for something else."
1,Too Basic,Provides basic understanding of SBS at best. I found more useful information from Knowledge Base. I was really disappointed. Skip this one and try something else.
3,Good product,"These single power binoculars do what they should, and I haven't encountered any fogging at this point in any conditions, from 60F to 20F. BUT: these small inexpensive units all share a similar problem...that da*&ed STRING that serves as a strap, but is just constantly in the way, and extremely uncomfortable when carrying around the neck for extended periods. I would have been more than willing to spend an extra $2-3 to have a real strap. Even just a flat vinyl strap would be a 300% improvement over this string. I'll have to see what I can do with an old camera strap...."
1,what else can be said...,"I think almost every thing's been covered by all the previous review. Typos, misinformation, inclusion and over exposure of a slew of non-metal bands, and exclusion of many bands and sub-genres."
2,BAD BOOK,"THIS BOOK IS SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT METAL BUT THEY HAVE BLINK 182, AND PEARL JAM? THIS BOOK HAS SOME GOOD PICTURES AND THERE ARE ACTUALLY A LOT OF GOOD METAL BANDS IN IT, BUT ABOUT HALF THE BANDS DON'T EVEN BELONG IN THIS BOOK. IT WILL MAKE YOU SICK WHEN YOU SEE WHAT THIS BOOK CALLS ""METAL"""
1,Trash (without the middle H),"If you check the part about the band you know everything about and you spot loads of mistakes, then you assume that also the other parts share the same defect.No one isexpecting a book to cover all the Heavy Metal Bands in the world of all the ages but what is expected is accuracy and this is what this text lacks. Nice photos anyway!"
1,Krahp,"I thumbed through this in a bookstore. Garbage. If you want a metal book probably the best I've seen (and own) are Sound of the Beast for generalized sutff, and Lords of Chaos for BM. Honestly, I've never come across a perfect or ""comprehensive, definitive guide"" that these metal encyclopedia books claim. But this one is one of the worst. As other reviewers pointed out the author seems to have no idea what metal actually is. Blink 182? Errrr right..... next."
3,Pretty good for what I payed,I only payed $5 for this so I didn't care. There are numerous mistakes in this book (like listing Dr. Feelgood as coming out in 1990). I really just bought this book for pictures. I like to get anything metal. There are some nice pictures in here. A nice cover because it has KISS on it. Not enough information on each band though. Only 2 pages on KISS. 2 pages on Zeppelin. A paragraph for just about every other band. It was only $5 so I don't care.
3,"A fair book in its own, but it will cheese many metal fans","This book is a good compilation of data on many bands, but much to my dismay, it has many of the ""new metal"" bands in it, and some bands I would never consider metal in it (everclear?). It does have the major bands in mentioned, Sabbath, deep purple, Ozzy, but why so many new bands. If I recommend one metal book, The encyclopedia of heavy metal is it, but this book is a nice compliment to it, like an apendix is to the encyclopedia set, or an update patch to a software program."
2,Just commercial bands,"If you expect finding all the groups of metal and all its's genres in this book .. this is not for you, the book cover only commercial bands and is not a product of investigation, good archive photographs but that's all"
3,"3 MAYBE 4 STARS, GOOD MOVIE WITH GREAT ACTORS","Watching this movie was a pleasant change from the far too common sex, violence and nudity that seems to be in all of todays movies. This movie can be watched by the entire family without having to make the little ones cover their eyes.The movie is about a mexican drug dealer who comes into the Country with drugs and a female alien. It covers their journey and troubles with other drug dealers, border patrol and other law makers.This movie is not the greatest, but it has great actors who portray their characters well."
1,Not so Good,I did not like the movie. It was long and had no plot. It is hard to keep up with the subtittels. A good thing however is you could never Guess who was on what side. So you had to finish the movie to find that out. Matthew McConaghey Did not show up untill the very end so Matthew McConaghey fans will be disapointed. The movie did not pull together untill the very end.If you want a movie were you dont have to think to hard this is it.
5,I liked the Wide Selection!,"This book has a great many scenes and monologues, and nearly anyone can find one that works for them. While some of the plays that are excerpted are a bit obscure, I found this to be only a minor setback, thanks to the magic of online book purchasing."
4,Privately Published Local History,"Picnic Point is a bight in Snohomish County, WA on Puget Sound. Two residential lanes run along the steep bluffs. The homes have stunning views through the trees, but winter rains bring the threat of landslides.If you grew up like I did in the vicinity of Picnic Point and Norma Beach or ever walked along the tracks of the Burlington Northern, you are likely to find this short historical account of the area interesting. I've always wondered about the pilings exposed by low tide, the carcass of the wooden barge on the beach, and the various abandoned cabins in the woods above."
5,Wonderful product!,These are a great addition to my tools for painting! They are Good for detail work and thee is a nice color selection.
3,They Work,I have only used them one time just to see how they work. They work as advertised and I expect to have fun using them.
3,It's manly,The watch looks exactly as described. Works fine. It looks like a man's watch. My Aunt is petite so maybe it wouldn't look so manly on someone that was larger.
2,not a major find...,"Gotta say, this book was pretty (...)... it disappointed me when I read it back in 7th grade (that was 13 years ago). While it does deal with the theme of alienation/not fitting in, and it does invoke the imagination (""what if I had psychic powers?""), it doesn't do either of these in a meaningful way, and it isn't particularly entertaining. I'm guessing we won't see this series back in print any time soon."
1,Bad Quality,"The t-shirt is cute, but once I washed it (according to directions), it was so shrunken that I gave it to my 7-year-old to wear. I bought a size large and now it's about a child's size 10/12. Don't buy it, unless you plan on never washing it or want one for your child!"
5,Short but with a point!,This short picture book story takes place in a village long ago. The boy comes up with a good idea while playing and wants the adults to listen to him but they are all too concerned about following their customs than trying his idea. Until one of the village elders finally thinks about it and realizes what a good idea it is. Eventually everyone ends up using the child's idea to their benefit. Perhaps to a child this book would encourage them not to give up easily and to an adult it would remind them to always listen to the ideas that children have and that rethinking customs is a good thing.
5,"""Specific, colorful, superlative, important, memorable""","This will, this should, become the new marketing bible. The authors are good -- so good you can hardly believe you are learning advertising pearls of wisdom as you are, simultaneously, entertained. If this were required reading for all ad folks we might see the end of dull and ineffective ads."
2,This is dreadful!,"This production is just dreadful compared to the other two available on DVD. Right from the beginning with a saloon that looked like a New York City tenement building, and costumes to match, with a chorus as dull as the gray of the room. Juan Pons as Jack Rance is able to sing the part, but that's all. He doesn't even come close to Sherrill Milnes' mean, tough guy portrayal. And Minnie, oh dear! Mara Zampieri was so all wrong for this role. Her voice I can only describe as ""thin."" When Placido Domingo finally arrived, he literally lit up the room with his presence. He remained the only bright spot in this entire production.Definitely skip this one and go directly to the Met production with Barbara Daniels as Minnie, Sherrill Milnes as Jack Rance, and Placido Domingo as Dick Johnson. That one is a five star winner!"
1,La Fanciulla del West,"This production was a real disappointment. First, I am just tired of singers who are 30 years or more older than the people they are protraying. There really is excellent young talent out there.I love the opera, but it takes a great director and great acting to save the libretto from seeming ridiculous. The acting here would not have passed muster in a high school play.The sound quality was part of the problem, but Zampieri was harsh and shrill. Domingo did not impress - especially with the acting. The Rance character did the best job both in singing and acting - and that was only good, not excellent."
2,Flawed production,"There are some great aspects to this production: the orchestra, Domingo's voice and that of Pons. Zampieri's singing is bad, though. I wonder why they gave her the role. Also the supporting members of the cast, while doing some great singing, are poor actors, and their stage movements are usually awkward.While the Royal Opera House DVD with Domingo and Neblett is pretty good, the great news is that the memorable production by Metropolitan Opera with Barbara Daniels and (yes) Domingo is now available on DVD. It is terrific."
3,Zempieri isn't my idea of Minnie!,"I'm in the minority here. Everything about this production is fine, especially Domingo, except for Zempieri who has the ugliest voice in opera in my humble opinion. Either you like her or you don't! I recommend the Met version of this opera first and Covent Garden's production with Neblett second. I have them all and only watch the Met version repeatedly. Zempieri also ruined the video of MacBeth for me as well. Just a matter of taste."
5,Excellent adaption of this opera,This is an excellent staging of this opera bringing all of its charms to life. Domingo captures the western bravado well in his character.
4,give it a break,"Okay guys, no bigger Leon fan than me so I a biased critic. It isn't Leon doing Christmas carols like most people do so if that's what you want or expect, skip it. It's Leon PLAYING Christmas carols in his style with a synthesizer backing him up ----- and it sounds great. People who might hate Leon would still love this album. I hate Christmas albums but this one is my favorite. The one-star folks need to give this great album a break and let it stand alone from his other music."
3,A nice stocking stuffer from a rock n roll legend.,"Leon Russell's ""Hymns Of Christmas"" is a very enjoyable holiday offering. All the selections are instrumental, but played with Leon's ear catching keyboard style. The cd is full of x-mas classics that we all know and love. The cover photo of leon's long white hair and beard really give the cd that Santa Claus holiday feel. The perfect gift for that 40 and over baby boomer this Christmas."
1,Christmas Clunker,Sorry Leon! I've been a big Leon fan since 1972 - but this is a bad one. Uninspired and one dimensional. I still hope he does a Christmas CD with vocals one one day.....
4,"Scary, but no where near what I thought it was going to be.","this movie had some scary images, to me that was the only thing that had me looking around. Rachel, the main characters niece dies a gruesome death, and she finds a blank video, and watches it. then she gets a phone call: ""SEVEN DAYS.""to me some of this movie was predictable, but had some upcoming surprises.I get scared easily, but to me surprisengly, it did not scare me. ...but it was still a really good movie, scary or not. BUY IT!"
4,Very gripping,"I am a lover of suspense, so this worked for me. Leaves you on the edge of your seat! The one thing I did not like (which is why I gave it 4 stars) was the ending. I do not like endings which do not explain the whys and wherefores of things....it stops rather abruptly and that's it. I would have preferred a bit better resolution."
4,Reviewing the DVD,"I aboslutely loved this movie. The movie itself deserves 5 stars. Despite what other people say, if you see the movie enough times ... you can figure out all the things that appear to be mere loose ends. Chilling and cryptic. Definitely my kind of scary movie.The reason I'm only giving 4 stars is that the DVD was not as wonderful as I was expecting. The ""all new short film"" seemed to be deleted scenes cobbled together with images from the video. Another thing - the ""killer video"" feature... the video was changed from what was seen in the movie. I feel this was unnecessary. I feel the video needed no added imagery. I wish there had been some more features... and a commentary. I adore commentaries. :)"
4,Not that scary but well done nonetheless.,"This film is a re-make of a Japanese horror film called ""Ringu"". Some people think that version is scarier but I think subtitles water down the scares.Anyway, this film is a very effective thriller, it does not use a lot of gore and blood, no twisted Clive Barkerish touches; but it does manage to deliver some good zingers every now and then. Some people say that the story is very hard to follow but I did not have any trouble: its actually quite easy to understand. This is a very good horror film, better than anything that has come out so far this year, except maybe ""Dog Soldiers"". I say buy it, the DVD is worth the $$."
4,The Ring,The Ring was one of the most scariest movies I've ever seen. I had to hold on to someone most of the time. At one point all of us were screaming. I think it is very mysterious and freaky. But the thing that I didn't appreciate was that it left you hanging. We all had unanswered questions about it at the end. There were some scenes that were pretty nasty ( like blood and guts). I loved it. I hope for a sequel.
2,Disappointing and pointless remake of horror classic,"Whilst Verbinski's remake of Nakata's classic is reasonably faithful (albeit mixing in few anachronistic elements from Ring 2 and Ring 0) it clearly lacks the visceral impact of the original.Firstly, switching the locale from Japan to Seattle greatly dilutes the atmosphere and rather diminishes the overall effect. Furthermore, Verbinski has pasted in a number of irrelevant scenes, which are little more than an irritating distraction, whilst skipping over some of the more atmospheric scenes from the original.Sure the movie is still an effective and thought-provoking horror, but that is entirely due to the magnificence of the original.Even the famous shock ending seems rushed here and feels spoiled.I'm afraid this merely reinforces my view that remakes are, almost without exception, (John Carpenter's The Thing being the exception) inferior to the original."
1,Big Waste Of Time,"I saw this with my mom. I dont really like horror movies and havent seen many. The only thing scary about this movie were the images. They were disturbing. There wasn't any moments though that made me jump out of my seat. As the movie went on I was able to make the connections. It wasn't that hard. But I knew the ending way into the movie. It just dragged on and on. Almost half of the movie could have been cut out. A lot of it just didn't need to be in the movie. Just please, dont listen to all these other people who say it was a good movie. They dont know what they are saying. Use you good judgement and use your time for something else."
2,What's The Big Deal,"When this movie first came out everyone said that they loved it. After I watched this movie I felt emotionally and physically drained. It seemed that what little storyline the movie did have was not connected at all and sometimes the movie made no sense at all. I will try not to spoil the movie but the ""death tape"" made really no sense at all to me. The only cool thing was watching the content of the tape, it was very bizarre. I will regretfully say that despite popular opinion I do not recommend this movie to anyone."
4,some jumpy parts,this movie is sracy when u watch it in tha dark! lol it is a good movie but not as sracy as RINGU but it is a good jumpy/thiller movie!
4,Scary and interesting,"The Ring is more of a mystery rather than a horror flick. The plot revolves around a videotape that, when watched, causes the viewer to die seven days later. A reporter, played by Naomi Watts, plays detective and unravels the mystery of the tape while becoming directly involved. The only drawback to the movie is the reporter's psychic, monotone son who seems to be based on a collage of previous horror flick children ala The Sixth Sense and Stir of Echos. The Ring has several genuinely terrifying scenes that will keep the viewers on the edge of their seats throughout. Bring on the sequels!"
2,"Great movie, lousy DVD","I thought this was one really scary film. And that's why it's getting 2 stars -- 'cause the movie's good. The DVD is miserable. There's nothing here worth buying -- in fact, there're really no extras at all. There is some deleted footage combined with the ""Ring"" video, but there doesn't seem to be any point to it. And there are two trailers for other films, one of them being the original Ringu. (Are we really expected to pay for advertising now?) That's it. No commentaries, no ""Making of"" features, not even cast and crew filmographies. Don't buy this DVD -- rent it today, and wait for a special edition to make this worth buying. By far the most disappointing DVD release I've seen."
5,A must see movie,"a new perspective for horror movies which engulf your vision and soul with suspence and fear,,can't wait for part 2 ,,,"
2,The Ring vs The Ring,"When seeing the american version of the Ring, one realises this is only a poor example of a remake.Japanese Director Hideo Nakata based this story on a book by Kji Suzuki. Nakata does succeed where Gore Verbinski fails : the sheer horror. In Ringu (japanes version) everything is left to the imagination. Ringu makes you guess, keeps you to the edge, where as Ring you even get to see the occasional ugly face.Furthermore, Ring is a compilation of THREE movies. Ring - Ring 2 and finally Ring 0 which brings you to the beginning of everything.Give the Japanese version.American Ring is none other than a commercial remake."
2,Oh my gosh!!!!!! Its SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO scary!,"This movie isn't at all scary like everyone says it is. It's stupid and has a very stupid plot. Anyone who watches some tape dies in seven days! Oh No! So when Naomi Watt's son wathces it, she must save him. So she watches it too as does her boyfriend. Of course they want to die too!!! So they examine the tape and try to find clues to save the world form this tape!! Wow! That sounds really scary!!It's really idiotic like the grudge and if you want to be scared, watch movies like the silence of the lambs and seven!"
1,I dont wanna be a pain in the ass but this movie sucked,"Really the movie was not olny bad it was the wost and most over rated horror movie I have ever seen.It not scary it's dry and weak,very dispointing but dont let this review slow you down,go see it if you must but I suggest you dont."
2,I WASTED MY TIME!! THE RING SURPRISED ME!,"The ring is not intresting for teenagers,and espacially not to adults.It's not a scary movie, there is more suspense then there is scary parts!!This movie was boring and desapointing.I'm the last person who saw the movie among my friends.They said it was a little scary but it wasnt the scariest movie they have ever seen. When i decited to see the movie it already came out on TV, my bast freind and i started watching and we were vary SURPRISED.All of my freinds were right it was a complitly waste of our time,the ring is not scary at all, it has a lot of suspense but its not scary.Maybe there were some parts that was a little scary but that's it!I would not be surprised if the ring 2 will be as teribal as this first movie."
1,"I give it a turkey, it shouldn't even get a star","I didn't know ghost like to interact threw VHS tapes. How scary is that? I probably should watch the movie again so I can be fair; however I remembered that it sucks pretty badly anyways. You have 7 days from the time you pick up the phone to live!?!?! If you don't pick up the phone after you watch the video, the mean ole ghost won't kill you. IT will just keep calling you back until you pick up, then you have 7 days. Funny, I don't remember camcorders being around in the 60's. Anyways, my rant doesn't probably make sense to those who haven't watched it."
1,Beware of the VHS,"What is it about VHS that makes it so scary. Is it the poor quality sound and picture, the rewinding, the lack of extras, or the bad think annoying size. Well the Ring plays on some peoples fear of the format. It involes a tape that kills you seven days after you watch it. How doesn't say, why doesn't say, what is going on doesn't say. I can tolarate little plot but not no plot. The little girl soal appear to kill through the TV. How she made the tape? how her spirit got so powerful? So many questions that have no answers. They say horror movies are the easiest kind of movie to make and The Ring is the biggest example of this. Sorry moddy setting, and scary music do not equal a good horror movie. It needs some kind of story. The Ring has no thought or talent. Please skip this and remember.""You should have bought a DVD player""""I don't I was going too""""NO EXCUSES"""
3,Not The Scariest Movie.,"C'mon this movie was not scary, at all. It wasn't a bad movie, the idea is great, but it wasn't scary. I've seen some call it the scariest of all time, obviously you havn't seen classic horror films, like ""Night of the Living Dead"", ""Body Snatchers"", ""The Omen"", ""Poltergeist"", ""The Fog"", these are true horror films, not this. I will admit there were a couple parts of the movie that got your heart pumping, but nothing to make you jump out of your seat. I guess if you scare easy it will, but i have seen the best of the best when it comes to horror films, and as a film student, this wasn't scary."
5,she never sleeps!!!!!!,"this movie was the scariest movie i've ever seen. My favorite part was when Samara came out of the tv to get Noah.great effects. This movie was so scary,I couldn't sleep the night I saw it. This movie takes your fear of the unknown,balls it up,and throws it at you!!! It's my new favorite movie.This is the reason everyone,now gets dvd's. that's it for my review,and remember,beware the tape!!!!!!!!!"
2,"Visually Beautiful, Mentally Defective","It looks great, it sounds great, but it's not great. The effects are nice - somebody went to town on digital grading, that's for sure, although the company that did the effects has a web site that needs a password to get into it - very annoying and un-user-friendly. Still, it's full of holes. The origin of the videotape never gets explained and we never get a reasonable explanation for how these people are getting these creepy phone calls from dead people. They really expect you to suspend way too much disbelief however and that ultimately pulls the movie down. This kind of convention has been done before, and far better, in movies like The Changeling. If you like this movie, you should really check it out, it's far better at conveying the same message."
2,Not what you're probably expecting,"This movie probably is not what you're expecting. It's hardly scary at all and the level of suspence is lower than an average X-files episode...Rent it, otherwise wait til it comes on HBO."
2,good start bad end,The idea of the movie is really cool and it satrts off good but then it gets boring i don't recommend this movie at all.
3,"not bad,but not the best...","well,i would say, this US remake of the ring is not bad,,copare to many other hollywood horror in past 10 years or so, it was well done.( not too much CG,especialy CG made monster in many other films such as Resident Evil)but if you see japanese original,you will see, US version is not showing charactors deep enough, such as anguish, fear etc.i think,they could make it better, but if you see this movie as original movie,not remake, maybe i can say its made fine.but if you have a chance, i recommend you to watch japanese original one. its surely more spooky,and better."
3,Scary and Disturbing,"I didn't see this movie in theaters, but my friend saw it and she thought it was good. She said that I should ""Rent it on VHS!"" (because of that whole tape thing). So I did and I unfortunately watched it on a school night. I only got 4 1/2 hours of sleep that night. This movie is scary and there are some images in it that are both creepy and hugely disturbing. I usually go for scary movies, but this one disappointed me. Not because it wasn't scary enough. It was because half way through the film I was thinking ""Who really cares if Naomi Watts gets killed in 2 days?"" Not that she's going to get killed of course. This movie was majorly confusing, the end is corny and makes no sense whatsoever. The girl, Samara, was the creepyist part and for good reason... SHE SOULD BE! That damn part of her coming out of the well with stay in my mind for a long time. I rated it 3 stars because I actually need to understand the movie to really like it."
4,Yeah,"Good movie, but it kept you thinking though. The DVD has great features. It wasn't as scary as i thought it would be. The ending was so-so."
4,Can anyone say Stir Of Echos,"Ok, first off, I thought this was a very good movie, even almost scary in parts, but I couldn't help fight the feeling of deva vu I was having. That's when it hit me, I was watching the sequel to Stir Of Echos (luckily though, no Kevin Bacon). I truly believe that the movie was suppose to end happily by them finding the girl and setting her free, but that's when they realized ""oh crap, we totally ripped off Stir Of Echos, we should do a SURPRISE (stupid) ending. I know it sounds like I've been ripping on this movie, but the truth is, even if they did borrow a lot from the other movie, I still think this is better than Stir Of Echos. In conclusion if you a scary movie fan, no, scratch that, if you are a movie fan at all you should watch this movie, it is deffinately worth your time."
3,"ok movie, dark and creepy","This movie is good. But I don't see why everyone was so scared by it. I guess it's a different kind of scared. It's not really scary, but more creepy. Few jump out of your seat parts. I think that is what they were going for with this movie, the more creepy and dark kind of movie. It is worth seeing but rent before you buy because you might not like it, it's hit or miss I think. Enjoy"
2,Greatly disappointed,"I was excited when the movie came out, saw it and went what? That was it? It was an interesting story but it could have been better."
1,THE WORST MOVIE OF ALL TIME- that should of been the name,this was the worst movie i have ever seen in my life.there was not one part in this movie that was scary.i think that scary movie was scarier.it was the wors the worst the worst movie of all time.dont lisin to the reviewers because they only rate the worst movies good.and that is what this movie is the worst.it took me 2 days to watch it because it was so boring.DONT Buy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!DONT Buy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!DONT Buy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!DONT Buy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!DONT Buy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!DONT Buy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!DONT Buy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Approval and disapproval all at once,"Overall..a decent movie..creepy at times, but then there are holes through the plot like swiss cheese.There are parts in the movie that could have either been elaborated more, or have been completely eliminated.The girl commin through the screen...that was kinda freaky..only because she didnt before the mystery was solved..."
2,The Sh*tiest horror film ever,the only thing i can say about this movie is that its a piece of SH*T!
2,Not as good as Everyone said,"A lot of people said that ""The Ring"" was scary and or had some scary parts and was excited to watch it. I thought it was going to be scary so I watched it at night to get a scare, but boiiiiiiiii, was I very dissapointed. This movie was not scary to me at all and I am glad that I didn't waste any money on it. It was stupid to me and I have a lot of unanswered questions. I don't feel like giving a long list of unanswered questions, but I will say this, DO NOT WASTE ANY MONEY ON IT AND IT IS NOT SCARY, WATCH IT ON CABLE OR BORROW IT FROM SOMEONE!"
2,Boring!!,Watch this movie by yourself at midnight and it still won't be scary. This movie is OVERRATED I would strongly suggest you to ignore this movie and the hype but if you have to go see it rent it first and see for yourself.
2,Was this supposed to be scary?,"After hearing that this was the scariest movie of the year, I rented the video. Thankfully, I didn't buy it. As a fan of X-Files, I love anything that puts me on the edge of my seat. Well, trying hard to remain awake, I tried watching this movie to the end. I like to think I have above average intelligence but did any one else have trouble figuring this one out? Who made the phone calls? Who made the video; a girl who died twenty-five years ago (when the VCR hadn't been invented)? This movie was very [weak]. If you enjoyed the X-Files, don't waste your time with this one."
1,This is not a scary movie this is as good as the Village,This movie is so overated and i believed the hype......so i went out and bought a copy of the ring for $15 bucks this movie sucked big time it had a very boring story and dragged on forever.......people who say this is scary are really people that should grow up because this is the dumbest horror movie ever made...........The Ring 2 will be dumber of course it will.............the only reason this movie was popular was because of the mass teeny bopper media that dragged alongside it this movie sucked bad!!!...........i want to go see the Grudge from the trailer it looked good......but then they said it was the producers from the ring and then i gave up hope...............The ring sucks ass boring not scary overated Hollywood mumbo jumbo crap don't get this movie its just that bad
1,OVER RATED!! Not worth your time!,"I was really looking forward to a scary movie but this wasn't!! I was just sitting there at the end with tons of questions; What the hell happened to the horses? Why did the wife go crazy? Main points of the movie left unanswered really left me with a bad taste in my mouth, I felt like throwing away the DVD after I watched it. One of those that keeps building and building and nothing but a let down in the end. Quite disappointing!"
2,great beginning...and then...what the heck happened!,"The beginning of this movie had me soooo excited! I was thinking that finally here was a scary movie that had something good going. A scary movie that actually was scary...then as the movie continued it just got more and more stupid. It was such a disappointment since the beginning captured my attention. As the movie goes on it just veers into blatant stupidity. It seemed like the writer had a wonderful idea, couldnt figure out what to do next and decided to just put in a whole bunch of confusing unnecessary (...).Then at the end I got excited again, thinking...okay! Now maybe everything will come together and make some sense...but then...it veered off into stupidity again. The movie is okay I guess. But when you think about it later you realize that absolutly NONE of it made sense! So you decide...but if you want my opinion...just watch Child's Play. At least that plot is consistant."
2,The Ring.......,This film starts off similar to Scream... which turned out averagely ok. I don't like the way they showed us what was on the tape but that's my personal opinion - BUT a good movie should cut through any personal descisions on how one would direct/ write it i.e THE MATRIX.The story of someone dying after viewing a videotape is good... but when the main character begins to learn why this tape kills people the film becomes a mass of confusioning sub - plots and a terrible anti- climax for something that started off interesting... Blair Witch was good...i mean excellent!! This film made me so angry cos of the end... there was no realism involved! 2 out of
5,Best Scariest Movie Ever,"For awhile now, I have become desensitized by horror movies, but this movie scared the hell out of me. The entire movie is eerie, with some very disturbing images. The ending is the most shocking (and scariest). You may think differently about a very popular appliance in your home after watching this one! Don't watch it alone..."
3,"entertaining, but hard to sleep afterward","I liked this movie. It was very entertaining, and very creepy, with no blood and gore, and a nice mystery to be solved. But it left me with nightmares. I didn't like putting a six year old in the way of a life-threatening situation. Also, there's a key assumption that evil exists (not tormented ghosts or a psychotic individual, but real unexplained evil), and even more, that it exists in a child, and it cannot be dealt with: it perseveres no matter what. Yuk! I like a movie like The Others that brings you to a conclusion that enlightens. But this one just is terrorizing for the pure joy of it. Except for the ending, I'd give it 5 stars, because up to that point it had me all the way."
4,My review,"A scary scary movie! Horror. Don't let young children see it. I had nightmares the following night. It's scary.But it's good! The parts where the girl climbs out the t.v. and it's so good of a mystery, a video tape that kills people. Scary, but good. And the effect where if you have a picture taken of you after you see the tape, your face is blurred. It's good. And all that errie music and stuff makes it even better."
5,Excellent movie,"This was a great movie. Many people say it was weird and that it didn't make sense, but I thought it made sense. Yes, it was weird, but that's what I liked about it. The concept was bizarre enough to hold my interest. Most of the events weren't too scary, what I found scary about it was how everything happened so suddenly and unexpectedly. And just when you think the movie is over, something completely and totally unexpected happens and the movie gets even more bizarre. But like I said, that's what I liked about it. You have to wait until the end before you can really understand everything that happened as a whole. Several times, I predicted what would come next, and instead something totally different would happen and that's another thing I liked about it, it was very unpredictable. If you want to make this movie even scarier than it actually is, I suggest watching it at night with the lights off, and the volume turned up. Overall, one of the best movies I've seen in a while."
5,Great Movie,"This is one of the scariest smart movies, it is psychologically scary, it gets you the way Silence of the Lambs and The Exorcist gets you. The gore isnt whast scares you,... , its what it makes you think about. I dont think that hollywood these days has had many good horror flicks but thish proves to be a great one. The story is great, there arent many special effects, but they are not needed, there also arent any pathetic attemptes at special effects. I would review the story, but i wont spoil it for ya...."
3,Good.. I Think,"I admit I'm still confused and I've been searching the net for more insight into this film. I have always liked horror/thriller films so I assumed I'd like this one. Well, in all honesty, I'm still not too sure if I liked it or not.The movie is, well, about a movie. Four teenagers watch this movie and within seven days of seeing it, they're all dead. Now it's up to newspaper reporter Rachel to figure out what's going on. I've been told that it's an adaptation of the Japanese movie ""Ringu"" and that one is better. Whether this review is helpful or not, I don't know.. but I do think you should rent this movie.. it will atleast keep your mind busy until you figure it out."
3,"An ""now I get it.."" movie","All in all an OK movie, for those rainy sunday-afternoons. The plot is good.. the ending better. You will only ""get"" this movie by watching the ending. Personally I like these kind of movies. Although the story is refreshing it sometimes rushes through the plot trying to fit the time frame. I'd rather see ""The Ring"" as an 3 hour movie, so they could tell the story better. Alas we've got this version.In favour of the movie I would like to say that it is a perfect blend of Blairwitch (part 2)and ""the 6th sense"". A shame however that M. Night Shaylamalan(??) ,director and writer of ""The 6th Sense"", hasn't directed this movie, for he could visualize it much better. But they didn't even ask him.I strongly recomend ""Ringu"" the ORIGINAL japanese version (yes... HOLLYWOOD didn't come up with this movie) for it is certainly better!! Even if you don't understand Japanese."
4,Visually brilliant,"Thought this movie was very scary - I'm 50 years old and have a large # of scary films to compare this to; it's VERY scary, partly because it's ""underdone"" in explicitness. But what I loved about this film was the way that it was filmed and edited -I thought that it was brilliantly done."
3,not bad..not great either,"Best part is the creepy fast change camera tricks-think of ""House on Haunted Hill"" or the opening credits of ""Seven"". ""House"" was better because it didn't make pretext at more than good fun, which this film does. It does have some very good moments, and is worth watching and probably owning if you like this genre. The ending is it's main flaw- muddled, drawn out, leaves too many loose ends hanging. These typically japanese elements of the plot, which I like, may not be your taste. Still a very clever idea. Execution (pardon the pun) could have been better."
3,Twisty horror thriller,"Having not been fortunate enough to have seen the original Japanese film (or its sequel) I'm probably not as qualified as others to give an accurate rating of THE RING, but I found the movie to be reasonably good. Basically this centres around a videotape which results in viewers dying bloody deaths after watching it. (No, its not THE SOUND OF MUSIC).Anyhow this tape falls into the hands of a young couple whose lives are turned upside down, especially after their son views it.THE RING has a few good ideas, some gross FX, a reasonably entertaining and twisty storyline and a few chills. It's a decent way to kill a couple of hours but after a while THE RING becomes a bit tiresome. My fellow Kiwis will be P.Oed at me if I don't mention NZer Martin Henderson, who does pretty well in this. It's a long way from his SHORTLAND STREET days. (The less said about that show the better.) Check it out."
4,"Great movie, but needs a better ending.","Anyone with smarts and a taste for abstract horror will enjoy this movie. If you're looking for a blood and guts type of horror film, this is not it. But, if you're more into a psychological thrill, like The Shining, this film delivers. I don't scare easy (especially by pg-13 movies) but this movie kept me in suspense throughout the film, exept for the lackluster conclusion. I wont spoil the end for you, but it left me unsatisfied. Overall I would say the good out weighs the bad. Good flick. B+"
3,Psycho illogical Thriller,"The first time you see this movie it truly rocks. However, after seeing a couple of times on DVD, you find out that this movie its just a series of scary flash shots snapped into a so so story. For example : if the reporter made the copy of the tape after day number 2, why then all the creepy things keep happenning to her if Samara already had 'forgiven' her ???. That among other things. Besides, 20 bucks for a DVD with out one single commentary ??? AYK ??"
5,One of the Scariest Movies I've Seen,"The Ring is super creepy, cringe creepy, even scream-out-loud giant-rollercoaster creepy.I think it can be so scary because the entire structure of the movie takes you anywhere and everywhere. Obviously, the screenwriter and director decided to take you anywhere that could be terrifying -- a dark and dusty old barn, a cabin ruled by demonic forces, a bizarre old insane asylum, a hidden sealed up well.It has lots of terrifying images -- photos that come alive, submerged corpses, deadly falls from high places, malevolent beings you can't figure out that are out to kill you or maybe just take over your mind. The scary image set apart at a safe distance joins you in your safe little room.For a milder story after this, see the original Psycho, one of classiest shriek-inducing horror films ever, Yes, it's that shocking.**It took me years to actually watch some of the scenes in Psycho."
3,good but hardly great,"i dont understand the hype behind this movie. i saw it expecting to be scared out of my wits, but was only mildly disturbed. its still a fine movie and all -- well worth the time to watch--, but more of a mystery/thriller with only two brief scenes that were meant to be a lot scarier than they actually were. plus, too many questions remain unaswered.bottom line-- it's the pefect movie to rent for a night with your friends, but not a dvd that you need to own. buy the original japanese version, ringu, instead."
1,good story but.............,"acually i give it 1 and a half stars. the story is good but the movie has a few scares at best and is way to long. when i first saw the opening scene i thought this could be a good movie. after that the movie became a long slow moving horror movie and then tacks on a stupid ending. the story is about a video tape when viewed, you only have seven days to live. a reporter who just viewed the tape must unlock the mystery before her times up. rent this movie first. as i said this could have been a good movie but the slow pace and lack of scares kills it."
1,Hollywood does it once again!!!!!!!,This is an example of how Hollywood can turn a good japanese horror movie and make a real mess out of it. The original Ringu is much more subtle and can really shock you without any gore and special effects. See Ringu and forget about The Ring.
5,Very Good!,"This was the best horror film of 2002! The only other good ones were One Hour Photo and Signs. This is one YOU MUST WATCH ALONE IN THE DARK! It's about this video tape that if you watch it the phone will ring, and someone on the other will say that you're going to die in 7 days. The atmosphere of this film is incredibly intense, and if you're ineed of a good scare, this is the one to see."
5,ONE OF THE BEST HORROR FILMS IN YEARS,"It seems that these days, a horror film is only scary because things just jump at you, but after seeing that same imaige over and over, its just not scary anymore. This film takes the right road in makeing in scary in your mind. You dont know whats going to happen next. There are some parts that just blantanly jump out to scare you, but this film succeds becasue it gets into your mind to get you thinking about the story, putting it all togeather. Great film, must have dvd."
2,Missing something,"You know how when you write something yourself you can overlook any mistakes in the writing again and again, like misspelled or omitted words, because you know what it's _supposed_ to say? I get the feeling that's what happened with this movie. I think the editor and producer needed someone else to take a look at this movie before they released it.There were a lot of things that weren't explained at all and also what seemed to be unnecessary scenes left in the movie. All in all, I did not find this movie to be very cohesive, and I didn't find that the ending answered many questions or resolved many issues. I also didn't get the feeling that the movie was supposed to be one of those subtle and/or leaving issues unanswered kind of movies (those gaping-mouthed corpses certainly weren't subtle). Try the book, Ringu by Koji Suzuki, that the movie is based on, it does answer your questions, and tells the story in a much more sinister way."
3,"Well, it scared my dog!","I watched the original Japanese film ""Ringu"" and watched ""The Ring"" later the same day. I enjoyed ""The Ring"", but I doubt if I would have been as impressed if I had not seen ""Ringu"" first. In the original, the story makes more sense. The remake attempts to add more detail but winds up being more confusing in the end.While I didn't find this one too scary, it really shook up my dog. He reacts strongly to loud sub woofer noises (things blowing up usually upset him), and there must have been something in the audio on this one, because he refused to sit still. I had to shut the movie off halfway through and take him for a walk before he would calm down. His behavior scared me a lot more than anything in the movie.I strongly recommend seeing ""Ringu"". It's more subtle and more interesting."
3,"I get it, no wait a minute, I don't, huh what?????","I love a good thriller. I had hoped that the Ring would fall in to that group. It didn't. Why? Simply, the plot made no sense and the ending explained nothing. If anything the ending just confused me more than I already was. Why had the horses died? Did they watch the video? Did they answer the phone? Did they even own a phone? How did Samara produce and distribute copies of the film around the Seattle area? Did she purchase the blank tapes at Walmart? Whose phone did she use to call the victims from after they watched the tape? Do dead people own cell phones? Hi this is Samra, I'm dead and you will be too in seven days, Can you hear me now???? I'm sorry, but there were just too many basic things that made absolutely no sense and had no continuity. Compared to sixth sense, psycho or halloween, this movie pales by comparison."
2,Japanese Original is Much Scarier,"I watched Japanese original ""Ringu"". The Ring only covers only a part the phychological part. The reason why ""Ringu"" is much scarier is because the underline Japanese culture. The original one is scary not just because the monster looks ugly (never saw her face), but because of Sadako's evil ambition and her ability to ""multiply"" in many ways..."
4,Terrified me,This was a very suspensful movie. At some times I could hardly breathe when I was watching it at 1am with my brother and cousins. It was terrifying for days after!!!! This was a wonderful movie... dark and sometimes a bit confusing. If you're looking for a fright not the brainless slasher movie... I think you'll be very satisfied with this selection!!... 7 days!
2,rent don't buy,i really was hoping to like this. i'm a major horror movie buff. this lacked in alllot of places. overall 5 of 10.
1,Total ....,"... It is not scary but stupid. The only movies worse than this is ""The Blair Witch Project"" and ""Horror House on Highway 5."" The second best part of the movie was the first 10 minutes and quickly went down hill (the best part was the credits). Do not waste your time. Terrible!!!!"
3,Only Okay,"Although parts of this movie qualify as ""freaky"", I would only recommend viewing it if you have nothing else to watch. The plot is kind of interesting, however, the movie doesn't explain everything it should. The acting is only so-so and the ending is anti-climatic. If you don't mind having questions about the movie that will not get answered, the visual effects might keep you happy. If you can't stop yourself from asking ""why?"" or ""how come?"", this movie will be too frustrating for you to enjoy. All in all, I would say that this is not the WORST movie you'll ever see, but it definately isn't the best."
2,Average Movie,"I cannot believe the number of good reviews this movie is getting. I was really excited to see this movie b/c I had heard how ""scary"" it was, but in all honesty, this movie is not scary at all! It has some very slow moments and the plot doesn't tie together well. I saw this movie w/ my girlfriend (who easily gets scared and doesn't like to watch scary movies), and after we left the theater, she wasn't even scared and we barely discussed the movie except for how it made little sense. If not for the twist at the end, I would've given this movie 1 star. This is a rental at best."
1,Pathetic,"When i saw this movie, i thought it was the most boring god awful piece of crap i ever saw. i'm not wasting money on this crap."
1,Deduct 1 star for accuracy.,I can understand that the original hasn't been wideley available in the States as it has been in Europe and this must have made this load of tripe seem more original than it was.Gore 'Mousehunt' Verbinski should be punished for this insult of a remake!
3,scary not scary-scary.....terrifyingly overated.,"Well this movie does scare you but it shouldnt be classified as ""scariest movie ever made"" or even close to any of them. It does pose a different style with instead of the normal scarying you with the sound it scares you with the picture. Most scary movies ony scare you when you suddenly see a decapitated ladys head pop out with blood everywhere and the surround sound speakers blow the place up. I did like how there was actually a story behing the girl samara and the ending which leaves you thinking as you walk out of the cinema or turn off the DVD/VHS player.But there have been better............................"
4,better than a lot that is out there right now,"I give this a little credit for being somewhat original in the concept, and it is weird enough to please me. Only complaint: ENOUGH with the pg-13 horror flicks, more gore please!!! Other than that, this is a head trip from hell. ""in the mouth of madness"" is a good head trip movie to...I couldn't imagine taking recreational drugs and watching this, you'd flip out!"
1,Not worth the money,"i saw the movie in the theater and it was no doubt a waste of money. i had been told by a few people that it was really scary but when i got there...nothing. A few jumps here and there, but that is not what makes a scary movies.The plot was a mess. There were scenes that should have been deleted and they should have elaborated on more scenes. The ending just leaves you confused because there is no definitive ending. They didn't explain the plot enough for you to affirm the ending.overall, rent it, don't buy it. A few cheap thrills but that's it."
2,disturbing and ...stupid? by caston,dont waste your time on this video it stinks it didnt make any sense at all i mean wouldnt rachel die when she watched the movie the movie is gory and gag me i thought it wold be good and scary but the fact that a girl named samara walks through the screen out of the question so dont waste time and money on this B movie
4,"Fun, but not scary.","Nice movie, has an interesting plot and some exciting moments. But it's not that scary. It'll scare the kiddies, but someone who's seen an actual horror movie before won't find it spooky. Although it is a good way to get someone into horror movies without freaking them out so much as to make them never want to see another ever again."
2,more like a comedy than a horror,"This movie wasn't scary there was so much hype about this movie being super scary but during the whole movie I kept on thinking when is something scary going to happen. Finally I get scared at the end but come on you shouldn't have to watch a whole horror film just to get scared once at the end. The fact that this wasn't a slasher film but a psychological film didn't bother me but a lot of things didn't make sense like where did the video come from and why is it that this girl is evil and how does she have this power to kill people and why does she talk to the boy. On a good note the scenery is very beautiful, with all the fog and how it's dark and dismal which gives the movie a very creepy feeling that I liked. Also it is scary to think that you could be killed from just watching a film. Anyways this isn't a movie worth owning but at least watching it once."
5,pure evil,"This movie is scary. The scenes are creepy, and the atmosphere really wrecked my nerve. However, the most scary point to me is about the pure evil mind of a child. When Rachel saved the girl out of the well, I almost felt sorry for Samara. She got abandoned, betrayed and, even worst, murdered by her parent. She didn't die right away in the well. She tried to crawl back on. Eventually all hopes were gone, she died lonely in the dark. I'd like to kill a bunch of people to release my agony if I were in her place.However, that is not the reason she kill. Neither is it the reason Rachel's being saved, more accurately, spared. At the end, we learned that Samara kill because she likes to kill. You think she spared Rachel because Rachel bring her back on earth, so she can peacefully rest in peace? No, just because Rachel bring more prey for her. That is it. She doesn't need your sympathy, and she will slaughter a couple more if she has chance. Simple, but horrifying evil."
3,Night of the Living Television Sets...,"So, where does one start when one pans a movie??? I rated this confused and less-than-subtle stinker ""3"" for the lovely cinematics. But, the story is a teen thriller that ends up like a... well... teen thriller.Desperately trying to be an art house heart-stopper, the story twists and turns and confuses and leaves you desperate for a great ending... but, guess what? That emptiness you feel may end up torquing your face more than a vacation snapshot."
1,The Cheesiest Horror Flick Since Blair Witch,I Recently Rented The Ring Today and I Was expecting thrills And Chills But instead got nothing but a film that was stupid it was like watching a B-Movie on cable. Naomi Watts is a great actress(I Loved her in Mullholland Drive)... But the one question that the filmmakers never answer is How can a Videotape kill its viewers a week after they Viewed it. I would Strongly urge people to rent this movie before going off and wasting [money] on buying it
2,Terrible Story,"As I said in the title, this movie has one of the most terrible story lines I have ever seen. The movie just didn't make sense, well for a person who likes a movie that has a plot that is somewhat believeable. I would like it to be explained how this magical tape appears first of all ""I know if I was a demon spirit I would go with DVD"", and next explain how just watching it will kill you. Then when the little girl calls you is it for real? is it some telemarketer on standby with a pre-recorded voice just waiting for someone to take the bait and watch this stupid tape again? This movie was far from frightening it makes you jump like twice and you a little weiry of your TV for like 5 minutes but if you are older than 12 and have an IQ higher than a cocker spaniel's you won't be scared at all."
1,POSSIBLY THE WORST MOVIE EVER MADE,"I would like to know who made this....crap?? Is this a movie?? There is no plot and i wasted 2 hours of my life watching it. It is not even worth 5 dollars for renting it, don't waste your time watching a movie ABOUT a stupid movie...When you have to start making horror movies about horror movies then you really need to stop...anyone who thinks this movie is good must of seen the wrong movie..horrible acting...horrible plot...dont't watch it for even 2 seconds, you'll be confused for the rest of your life (i still am trying to figure out the bunch of meaningless ideas the directors threw in at the end fit in with the movie)"
1,"The worst film I've seen since ""Minority Report""...","Much like Minority Report, The Ring is replete with plot holes and possesses a gibbering mess of a storyline.It is yet another example of the film industry's decline.M. Night Shyamalen (Sixth Sense, Unbreakable and Signs) seems to be the only director capable of making a first class thriller these days."
1,E.T. is more scary........ if that tells you anything!!,"I think it's hilarious how some people describe this pointless, not to mention STUPID, ridiculous waste of time movie as THE MOST SCARY MOVIE I'VE EVER SEEN. Give me a break!! Yeah, everyone seemed to hype it up as this scary as he11 movie, so I watched it.. and (LOL), it's just DUMB."
1,A Laughable Horror Flick,"...It started off as though it was going to be good. Then it was almost 2 hours of boredom...If you consider this movie scary in the least little bit, then you obviouly haven't seen a scary movie..."
5,"""A very scary movie""","""The ring"" is a very scary movie, whice have a lot of blood, murders and a scary things that don't suitable for a little children (in fact, the movie is for people who up 17 years old). The movie is very invested and convincing and the scenes of the murders and the scary scenes are amazing and they put you in shock. you freezing in you place when you see it- it is really really scary! the movie has a wonderful plot and the story is done excellent. all the movie you are confused and you trying to understand what is going on and in the end of the movie you understand all the details who were blurred in the movie. the actors are very good and when you see the movie you see that the movie is very invested and that a lot of people invested in him a lot of time. i liked the movie- he is great and really scary!"
4,"a ghost story does not have to take place in an ""old dark ho","I reluctantly put this DVD on the other night, thinking it to be another lame horror film typical of the genre over the last ten years. Boy was I wrong. This film may have some of the creepiest imagery since ""Carnival of Souls"". In addition to the nightmarish imagery, this film also included an Urban Legend, an intriguing mystery and a twist at the end, all these things kept me completely engrossed in the film from beginning to end.I did not see the original, so I am only reviewing it based on it's own merits. The plotline does have some flaws but not enough to distract from its overall impact. The fact that the story centers around television and video proves that a ghost story does not have to take place in an ""old dark house"" to be scary."
3,"SCARY, GOOD, BUT I'D STICK WITH THE ORIGINAL.","THE RING WAS A SCARY MOVIE. IN FACT, IT WAS SCARIER THAN ALIEN, THE SELF-PROCLAIMED SCARIEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME. BUT WHAT IS IT THAT MAKES GOOD MOVIES?THE ACTING? THE STORY? THE ENDING?IN THIS CASE, IT IS THE STORY. THE ACTORS DID A WONDERFUL JOB OF CAPTURING THE EMOTIONS OF THEIR CHARACTERS, BUT THE STORY I HAD A PROBLEM WITH. IT HAS COMPLETELY ORIGINAL IDEAS, SOME THAT DON'T HAVE PURPOSE. THE MOVIE COULD GO ON WITHOUT THE HORSES. SO, GET THIS MOVIE. IT'S GOOD, AND IT'S SCARY. JUST WATCH THE ORIGINAL FIRST."
4,"The Ring, better or worse than the original Japanese hit?","Having seen both of them, and having liked the original alot I came into the theatre very skeptical. Being an Otaku of years past I had come to believe that all things in Japan were better than anything America could conjure up. I sat down and I was scared. This movie is visually more frightening and more scary than the Japanese. I also like the fact that they took out that the report's boyfriend was somewhat of a telepath. I felt that didn't really add to the story or aid it in any way.Overall I liked The Ring and I found it more scary than the original."
3,"Creepy, but unremarkable","A Seattle reporter (Naomi Watts) tracks down the truth behind a cursed videotape that kills those who view it within seven days. The strength of this film is its creepy atmosphere, which is quite skillfully achieved. However, it just seems to drag on after a while and does nothing to improve on the Japanese original. Having seen both versions, I was struck by the way that needlessly expensive special effects, however well done, have the effect of distancing the viewer from the potential horror of the image. Although the Japanese version was clearly made on a much smaller budget, each of the creepy set pieces packs more impact than this over-produced American remake."
4,Enjoyable for a non-horror buff,"While I enjoy Sci-Fi/Fantasy, I'm not a huge fan of horror. Turns out this isn't exactly a horror (note the pg13 rating), as much a drama/mystery with some horror elements. I was pretty satisfied with the movie as well as the ending, many people might have seen it coming, but I was sufficiently engrossed in the movie that I found the ending intruiging. In all it gets higher marks because it was better than I expected, and didn't get perfect marks because it just didn't have *enough* orignality to make it a GREAT movie. Basically - I'm glad I rented it and didn't spend the $9 to see it in the movies. :)"
2,Bunch of bad acting; 30 measly seconds of scariness,"This movie strings you along, bores you, displays some attrocious acting, then FINALLY hits you with about 30 seconds of terror, near the end. I expected more.Watts' character is totally unbelievable as a Mom; the kid is totally unbelievable as her kid. Neither display anything even remotely resembling true mother/child affection towards each other."
2,Still another example....,"of taking a fascinating premise and doing absolutely nothing fascinating with it in a movie. There are a few decent (decent, NOT good) scares lasting maybe 2 minutes. The rest of this is loggy, predictable, and poorly acted. Blah. The hype outweighted the film by about 500%"
4,Creepy And Disturbing,"I wouldn't call it the scariest movie I've ever seen, but it definitely sends a chill down your spine. Filled with strange and creepy imagery, ""The Ring"" is a good watch. Of course, the story revolves around a video tape that kills you seven days after watching it. The herione Rachel has to unravel the mystery which involves a young girl and her mother. The story-line does get confusing on the first watch. You almost have to watch it again just to get a better grasp. The acting is fairly good, although there are a few parts that I find amusing, *ex. what is up with Rachel screaming ""LEAVE HIM ALONE!!!"" into the phone?* but nothing so bad as to ruin the movie. Watch it late at night alone and see what you think...just hope the phone doesn't ring!!!!"
2,The Ring,Why buy this when you could rent it...I couldnt make head or tails of this one....Heard a lot of hoopla about this one but i would call it a dud...It had potential then it fizzled....Lots of bizarre visuals and cut scenes...
4,THE RING: SCARY OR NOT?,"I know most of you have heard about this movie and about how scary it is. Well, there is a level of horror to the movie but it plays more mindgames than anything else. This is the best attempt at a horror movie in a while. This movie makes ordinary things like a ladder, water, a man in a window, etc...seem really terrifying. Overall, this movie is actually a pretty good movie and that is why i gave it 4 stars. So if you get the chance to see this movie, watch it!!!"
3,Interesting movie,"I didn't find this movie frightening, however, I thought that it had enough suspense to keep my attention. If you didn't like Signs, then this might be your kind of movie, though not perfect, but it made more sense (it was marketed as a scary, suspensful movie which it was). Ignore the stuff when the movie tries to explain VHS codes and stuff--not very important, if it was, it was confusing. Overall, the movie was good."
3,Don't watch twice,The first time I saw this in the theater and it was very nice. I had a lot of after thoughts about the movie and was refreshed by its style. When I watched it at home the second time it seemed very goofy and the little boy character made me wanna scratch his little eyeballs out. It's worth one watch though.
4,Good American Take on Japanese Modern Classic,"""The Ring"" is a decent Americanized verison of the Japanese horror film ""Ringu"". While it removes things that American audiences may have trouble understanding or accepting (i.e. the boy's father is somewhat psychic, and this is never addressed as being odd), it adds some interesting twists and features (i.e. the horses). While both films end the same, I find the Japanese version to be creepier - possibly because I saw it first.If you're into Japanese films, get ""Ringu"". Otherwise, ""The Ring"" is a decent scary filck."
4,Scary Movie,"For several years friends have been telling me I just NEED to see the movie The Ring. I assume this is because I am a fan of indie genre fiction, mainly horror and dark fantasy. Well, I'm not easily scared; having seen almost everything in my 58 years on Planet Earth, but this film shook me. To call it creepy is an understatement. I really don't enjoy the bloodfests that are commonly associated with horror, and The Ring isn't that kind of horror. It's subtle, well written, and got my skin crawling in a way I've haven't felt in a long time. This is a must see for anyone who enjoys real horror, not just blood and decapitations."
4,Watch Those VCRs at Low-Budget Motels!,"This was a great movie. At first I thought that it might be kind of stupid or geared towards kids, but it held my interest the entire time. Of course, it has a supernatural bent, which stretches the imagination a bit, but for that genre, it was very well done.The basic plot is that several teenagers watch a strange videotape and within one week, they are all dead. A reporter finds out about this because her babysitter is one of the teenagers who died. She and her estranged husband investigate the suspicious deaths.The story moves quickly, the acting is good, and I imagine that watching it at night with the lights out would be creepy. Lots of fun and I liked it."
5,The ring,"In the first 10 min. of this movie, it was immediately my fave.I thought this movie was just so cool, not scary. Im the type that doesnt get scared easily though. If i was, i would be scared out of my mind. i loved this movie."
2,Ho-hum,"""The Ring"" is the latest in a string of new psychological horror movies, a trend probably started by ""Scream"" or ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"". It's a horror story wherein characters die one week after viewing a horrific video tape. An hour in, I was envying the characters.I'm a big horror fan (heck, my twenty-fifth birthday party had a ""Legend of Boggy Creek"" theme), but I simply could not buy into this premise - a killer video tape? I mean, give me killer dolls any day over that. What's next, murderous spatulas? Killer quiches? Honestly.Rent it for a laugh, nothing else. The only thing to fear about videos is late fees."
2,Stick with the original.,"If you're looking for a good horror movie, Asian cinema seems to be the place to look nowadays. Nothing exemplifies this more than The Ring. A remake of a 1998 Japanese film, the American version is lacking everything that made the original such a talked-about hit. The two most important aspects that it never can quite achieve are subtlety and atmosphere. In the orginal, the kids all look as though they've died of fright. In the remake, they look as though they've died of fright, AND THEN TURNED INTO DECAYING, DEMONIC CORPSES!!!! All this did was to add to the special effects budget. It doesn't improve the atmosphere, and it totally ignores the idea of subtlety. You don't need decaying, gooey, demonic corpses to make a creepy, disturbing movie.The DVD looks good, sounds good, has a short movie made just for the DVD, but I'd recommend skipping this and buying the original."
3,This is not psychological horror,"Let me say that this is not psychological horror. The movie is full of cheap scary shocks. Personally I don't like this horror movies, they are based in these shocks because they can't scary you other way. I give it 3 stars because is not a bad movie at all, in fact it have nice spots and the story can hook you. But if you want to see a truly nice psychological horror movie, go for ""SESSION 9""."
3,Stop Color-Bleaching Films. Quit the Green-Tinting!,"Many subliminal images here in this film. Very eerie and gross. I dislike the films that are shown in green tint also known as color-bleaching and ultra-violet.

1,I just could not get into it,"Aside from that one scene at the end, this movie did not live up to the billing as ""The Scariest Movie since the Exorcist."" The premise looked great on paper, and the original Japanese flick was quite interesting. This movie, however, fell flat on its face. It was rather disjointed, and didn't rely on gore really to scare...it tried to be suspenseful, but was unable to create an atmosphere that left the audience in fear for the duration of the film. There are much better horror movies than this. If you insist on seeing it, get Ringu."
2,save your money,"this movie was okay but i wish i didn't buy it. definitely not even half as good as people were saying. it's not very scary and a lot of the scenes just did not make sense or fit. the movie is like a big mess of boring scenes mixed with pointless scenes sprinkled with a few semi-scary scenes. nothing in the movie is explained too well but when watching the movie you hardly care because you're not entertained too much and you're just waiting for this poorly written mess to end. i watched it once and let a friend borrow it who asked me if i ""got"" what was going on in the movie and told me the movie was ""okay."" while i ""got"" what happened in the movie and explained it to my friend, it was just so ridiculous you have to wonder how the script made it to the big screen. not sure how this movie compares with the original, but the original just has to be better. buy that if anything."
1,NOH!!,"Now, now now - before my phone starts ringing ..... this one's a pale copy of the original [granted more special effects, etc - ala Bunel, Dali and Hitchcock - see ""Vertigo""], but so much better before - remember ""Ghost Story"" and possibly the lesser seen ""Changeling""? More shock value there.This one's a modern retelling of the classical Japanese NOH theatre tale - the 'vengeful' ghost seeking retribution.Granted there are a few minor jolts - but it is not too special -more or less something for the kids on a very wet afternoon.Sorry! Wrong number!"
1,Whats All The Fuss About,"I desperately wanted to see this movie because I'd read loads of top reviews and the trailer made it look fantastic. But when I did see it I thought the film was absolute rubbish! Sure its kinda scary when something jumps out at you but people are comparing this film to classics like The Exorcist! Hello. The Exorcist was actually a decent film with a storyline that didn't make you feel like you wanted to kill yourself. The Ring has a complicated storyline and unlike most horror movies YOU have to work it out instead of being told about it. After a small generation of fantasy type horrors (Soul Survivors, They . . .) I'm proud to say The Ring is just another [copy] that has been hyped up way too much!"
3,its wasted by its stupendously stupid ending,"a great thriller with some chills but the end where the kid says she doesnt sleep is a real hole in the story. Watts is sexy and great as always, but the fact I liked this movie is because it had some spizazz, intelligent scenes. like the horse or the disfigured images or the showings on the tape."
4,Good Urban Legend,"Creepy, not too gory, great suspense. Naomi Watts is tortured by Samara in this movie. Keeps your attention and you will watch it more than once as you will see things you missed the first go around"
3,Curiosity provoking + Some scary moments = Worth watching.,It has some scary and suspenseful moment.s It's curiostiy provoking. The ending is predictable and a disappointment. It's still worth watching.
3,I saw the Japanese Version first...,"Again I like the Japanese Version (Ringu) more. Nothing much to say about this flick and I cannot believe people can give such a long review. Buy the CD, don't buy the tape...hehehehehehehehehehe..."
5,A VERY scary movie!!,"This has to be one of the most effective horror movies in years. It involves a video that people die after watching, and I was sure I was going to die of fright before The Ring came to an end. The plot is somewhat one-dimensional, but the images will stay with you long after the closing credits. If horror films are of interest to you, don't miss this one!"
5,The Ring Rocks,I'm not a very big horror movie fan. I hesitated to see this movie because of the countless times that I've been sorry for seeing a movie and it was horrible. But the Ring hits the spot. This has got to be the best horror movie I have seen. I saw it twice at the movies and I will for sure see it on DVD.
4,I almost peed my pants,"Ok, here is some background. So my parents never let me watch horror movies when i was a kid, I'd sneak in the nightmare on elm street or the Texas Chainsaw Massacre here and there but never watched a lot of them. Now I'm 21, and this movie scared the bejesus out of me. Going to sleep that night i kept waiting for the television to turn on. Like the previous reviewer, the use of sound was great, sound and sudden grotesque images. I wouldn't preorder it for amazon's [$$], i'm sure after it comes out you'll be able to pick it up for less. Make sure this one is in your DVD stable."
3,Promises Aren't Exactly Fulfilled...,"Oh what to say about this film? It is basically a film you can either love or hate. I'm kind of in- between. I don't hate it, but I can't say I really love it either. I own it, but only watch it like once every year just to get a good scare, but this movie does not offer too much else.It is scary, I'll give you that. The disturbing images and whatnot we have to see, then the story of the little girl is very successful at giving me chills at least. And the movie itself was something new and refreshing to see in the US theaters, among the other ho- hum horror films that continue to be popped out.But just because a film can give you chills, etc. doesn't mean it's necessarily fulfilling. The actors are just as plain as most horror actors are, the kid is yes annoying, and the ending itself leaves you in discontent. The story ended and I just was not satisfied the way a viewer should. Overall, I would recommend it, but I don't call it a favorite.3.5/5"
4,"Great, but Confusing","I really enjoyed this movie, but it confuses me to death. There are many things in The Ring that I cannot figure out. Nonetheless, this is a great movie and is worth buying."
5,This is the single scariest movie I have ever seen,"This is my favorite genre of movie, and The Ring, is by far, the scariest of all. I thought this movie was going to be a cheap teen scream slasher movie, but it moved way beyond that to a whole new level. This movie will haunt you for days after you watch it."
2,Far from scary,"The movie never really gets going until the very end. Watching the boy draw circles gets old the first time you see it, and is worse when you realize the boy is more annoying than anything else. I give it a second star for the last TV scene with the girl, and the last well scene."
1,I don't get it,So there's an evil dead girl in a well and she made a cheesy short film on a VHS tape? Hello??? Hasn't this girl heard of DVDs??? And she kills you by showing you her face? Oh please! Michael Jackson's face scares me more! This movie is not scary in the least. I kept waiting for something to make my heart skip a beat but that moment never came. And when I thought the movie was over it wasn't and when I thought there was something else coming it ended. This movie is terrible. There are way too many plot holes. And the DVD extras are a waste of time.
4,"YOU MIGHT LOVE IT, OR HATE IT","DONT SEE THE RING IF YOU NEED AN EXPLANATION FOR EVERYTHING. IF YOU DONT THEN THE RING IS AWESOME. THE VISUALS ARE GREAT AND IT IS QUITE SCARY. SOME STUFF DOESNT MAKE A WHOLE LOT OF SENSE, IF ANY... BUT IF YOU CAN GET OVER THAT THEN SEE THE RING. I VERY MUCH ENJOYED IT."
4,The Ring- Review behind the tape,"I thought the The Ring was a pretty good movie but it was kind of freaky. I went to go see it with my dad when I was only 10 earlier this year and it scared my dad and I told him it scared me but it did not. I have to admit that the makeup on all the victims was scary with the burnt looking brown skin and the huge, round and frozen eyes that make it look like they had seen something terrible."
2,Yuck!,"I expected a dark, terse, exciting horror film. Instead, I got this. Now, no offense to the people who made it, but this was the most disappointing film since...(twenty seconds later)...since...Anyhow, I didn't like it. It didn't scary me at all (okay, the scene with Noah, Samara, and the TV was a LITTLE bit creepy). Actually, I thought it was more comedy than horror, such as the scene my friends and I have dubbed ""The Suicidal Demon Horse Scene!"" (I cracked up when I saw that, not that there's anything funny horses die).And another thing! People in horror movie's are SO STUPID. It really ticks me off. I was near the end of the movie, and Rachel (was that her name?) was trapped in the well, and she finds (spoilers) and I'm like ""WHY THE HECK DID YOU WATCH THAT STUPID TAPE IN THE FIRST PLACE!?""There were really two things I liked. The premise (inspired idea) and the scene where we see the video. That was my favorite scene, hands down. Wait, no... Suicidal Demon Horse!!Is ""Ringu"" better?"
1,Im throwing samara and the ring back down the well!,"Ok, this movie only had a pretty good plot, but the rest sucked! like the cast, the sound effects and everything else! Most inportant it was NOT scary at all. i only jumed wen you see the dead girl in the closet. This was a dissapointment to me, since im a huge horror movie fan, now if you love horror, them The Grudge is a MUST See! staring my obsession... Sarah Michelle Gellar! GOOOO SARAH!"
4,Wow!,"The Ring, i have to admit was scary, only to an extent. I was scared two times out of the whole movie (really scary stuff)! but, I feel like it would have been better to see it in the movie theatres, it is not the same affect watching it on dvd than the great thrill you would have watching it @ the movies. good movie, but weird? It sort of relates to What Lies Beneath, with its psychopathic thriller part about it"
3,Such A Wonderful Movie Ruined By The Ending,"This movie left me on the edge of my seat, because it was so confusing, you didn't know what was going to happen next. By the middle of the movie, you're already curious what is going to happen next. But her falling into the Well was the stupidest scene ever, she gets hit by the damn T.V. and falls in, bad timing to be adding comedy. The little girl coming out of the T.V. was also very stupid. This movie is not horror, it is mainly mystery and suspense, and a lot of cheesy comedy which fails 90 percent of the time. Overall 3 out of 5 stars, if the ending could have been changed, the rating would be higher."
5,I will never look at wells the same...,"This movie was SO good!!! I've watched it so many times, and each time, Samara is just as freaky as the last. i've heard some people say it was dumb, but my best friend and I watch it all the time. The best part is in the end, where samara comes out of the TV with her hair in front of her face, and its so scary because they angle the camera like shes coming out of YOUR tv. That was so scary the first time I watched it. The girl, named Katie, was so freaky too when they found her in the closet. Her face is the kind that sticks in your mind, especially when your alone and have to get something out of your closet......"
4,The Ring,"Hmm... what can I say. One night sitting bored channel surfing I saw the ring was coming on and I'd heard mixed reviews so I decided to see it and formulate my own opinion. I'm not going to lie to you like some others who change their opinion after someone else saying it's not scary. It was fairly disturbing at times however it seemed to be lacking.My real critiques would have to be the reuse of the already beaten to death boy who sees dead people, which was in fact not in the other versions of the movie (See, Ringu) and I feel detracted from the dispense . Also I feel that it diverted nearly ridiculously from the books story and was more of a mystery/suspense thriller than a horror movie.However all in all it was a satisfying watch and Gore Verbinski did an excelent job perfectly reproducing certain scenes from the previous renditions of the film."
3,A truly fine idea...for a while,"THE RING is one of those films that makes you wish the writer and editor and director had spent more time with the released project. This little fright film houses some fine effects, gets you hooked into an almost implausible concept, and then sells out to sensationalism in the end. But the cast of actors includes Naomi Watts and Martin Henderson as contemporary lovers who have a strangely sensitive son (well played by young David Dorfman), Jane Alexander at her usual fine state as a physician, and Brian Cox in yet another superb cameo. The underlying metaphors about life and death, meaning and parenting are good. The scenery is gorgeous (Seattle and surroundings) and the tricky camera work is excellent. But better to leave the room before the last 10 minutes or so of this scary movie turns into Hollywood silliness."
2,Um...,"OK, yeah, there were some scary scenes. But it was overall dumb, illogical, and a wate of money to see. Instead, go watch Night on Earth or scarface"
2,"Hype, hype, and more hype","It has a plot, which is more than most movies these days. Unfortunately it doesn't make any sense nor is it scary."
2,"Hey Glynn from Belton, TX","Since you took it upon yourself to bad mouth everyone who didn't like this movie, maybe you can answer a couple questions about the film, since were to stupid and dumb, to figure out the movie. Why did the horse chase after her? Why could her son communicate with the dead? i mean your just able to do this, and your mom doesn't really give it two thoughts?"
1,The (Bo)Ring,"If you thought this was scary, you either think On The Line is a cinematic masterpiece, or you have no sense at all. Oh, wait, same difference.This is pure hokey, watered-down, cheap, mainstream garbage. If it actually scared you, you got problems.Just watch the original."
2,Stupid,If you are into that paranormal activity junk and you believe it (which I don't) this might scare your pants off. As for me it had a few scary moments. As a mystery movie it kept me watching. As a horror movie it wasn't my thing. Give me a zombie movie or slasher movie any day. That is how I define horror. I bought it at a pawn shop for 99 cents. I'm glad I didn't pay more for it.
1,Watch this movie - and your brain will die,"Not scary- not even a good story, so many plot holes and things left unanswered. I was ready to give it 2-3 stars when I thought it had ended it as ghost story/who-done-it, but they decided to tack on a extra 20 minutes and throw all credibility out the window."
3,Stylish but Silly,"Great performances and some thoughtful and subtle direction, make this an intriguing diversion. However, the complete and utter implausibility might fall flat on the more literal-minded.*spoiler*I mean, c'mon, a little girl climbing through television screens killing people because she got thrown into a well, when she was asking for it in the first place...whatever...However you'd have to say it's another feather in the cap of Naomi Watts, who acquits herself admirably, given the complete lack of irony in the film's approach to the subject matter (which is probably no bad thing, the sly, wink-wink, nudge-nudge thing is getting a little tired).Overall though, a triumph of style over substance."
2,overrated,"I am a great horror movie fan. So when the Ring came out to good reviews from the critics, as well as my some of my friends who claim the movie was very scary, I was excited and rushed out to buy my DVD, but I must say I was disappointed.The movie had minimal chills at best. It did have a good mystery going until at the end of the movie when they explained the reason why everyone diedafter viewing the video tape. I mean come on after all we have seen in horror films over the years, seeing something come out the T.V. is not scary at all, unless it happens to you in real life."
4,Chilling,"When a group of teenagers ... yes, that's what I thought too, but wait - it's not a teenage slasher film. This foursome of teenagers watch a tape in a cabin in a hideaway retreat. A week later they all die in seemingly unrelated accidents. When the bereaved mother of one of the children asks her sister (the child's aunt) to investigate, the reporter makes short work of finding out about the tape and watching it. As she investigates, she quickly comes to realize that there is truly something special about this tape and that the clock is ticking. She has seven days to find some way to avert her death as well as that of her videographer ex-husband whose aid she had enlisted in determining the origin of the tape and that of their son. Their only hope is in deciphering the meaning of the tape and carrying out its cryptic message. Superb acting, fast plot advancement and great plot twists make this an enjoyable movie for a cold, dark night."
2,overrated,"i really dont see what all the hype is about this movie. OK, so it has it's share of frightening parts, but other movies such as FEAR DOT COM, DARKNESS FALLS, and GHOST SHIP did too. sorry, but a girl crawling out of a tv monitor just does not scare me."
1,1 Star is the lowest they'll let me go!,"The most over rated movie since Blair Witch Project. I can't say much more, it might have been scary if I was 4 or 5! If you want scary stick with the Exorcist. Don't waste your time."
1,Boring,while i was watching it in the theater all the people around me were getting scred but i had a really hard time telling what was supposed to be scary and having a hard time staying awake. I would have to say that the only cool think in the movie was how the girl died in the begining.
1,Totally Stupid,"If you like the way it looks then get it; otherwise don't bother. I have had this installed on my car for three seasons now and it has not helped lower the temp at all. I measure the intake temp on my car via a custom electronic gauge that accesses the VW system on my car and with or without this product my intake temp at the manifold is 10 degrees less than ambient temperature. Plain and simple there is no temperature reduction using this product and I have measured it multiple times with and without it. In fact, in the colder winter temps this actually had an increased temp over winter temps without it since the cold outside air moving through the compartment was not allowed to contact and cool the tube."
4,Interesting and informative,"I always find it interesting to read about famous people's lives, but especially about the people who have been behind the scenes so to speak and little is told about them. That is why I found this book so interesting. Robert E. Lee is well known as the civil war general who surrendered and the war ended, of course, but to read more about his wife and get an insight to his family life made it hard to put the book down. There are some basic history rehashed somewhat in this book, but over all I found the book very personable and engaging in letting me know something about this woman whom I had never really heard of before. It also will show readers that no matter how famous a person may be, all people have their troubles and sorrows- and a lot of how life turns out to affect you depends on your reaction to what has happened in one's life. If you enjoy anything about the Civil War, this book would be a definite must !"
5,What did he ever see in her?,"I read this book in three days as it was very well written, but did not, in my opinion give a very favorable view of Mary Lee. It portrayed her as self-centered, and like her father, more obsessed with the Washington connection than with the Lee connection. It pictures him as madly in love with her, I just cannot figure out why? I think it is very telling that none of their daughters chose to marry. Already a huge fan of his, the book only reinforced my good opinion of him."
5,LOVED IT,"THE BOOK WAS VERY WELL WRITTEN.MADE ME THINK I WAS LIVING IN THE TIME. I COULD NOT LAY THE BOOK DOWN,I EVEN GOT ON THE ARLINGTON SITE AND LOOKED AT SOME GREAT PICTURES OF ARLINGTON AS I WAS READING THE BOOK AND THIS MADE THE BOOK ALL THE MORE INTERESTING. GREAT AUTHOR."
2,Mrs. Robert E. Lee,"The book is basically uninteresting except for the first chapters which talk about the relationship between the upper class families in Virginia and the background of Arlington. After that, sentimentality takes over. I don't recommend this book unless you like that kind of thing."
3,Gook Book But A Little Slow,"I enjoyed the book but found it a little slow. The one thing that bothered me was becasue Mary Custis Lee was a devote Christian, there are several references to what she wrote in her diary about her belief in God. I got tired of reading what the author felt was important information about Mary's life. I ended up skipping over all the passages.I would recommend the book if you are interested in that period of our history."
3,Cuts well but the blades do heat up,"I have had this for several months now; my wife uses it for trimming when she provides the family haircuts. The unit itself works fine, but the blades can get extremely hot once they run for a while. They get hot to the point to where they can cause some degree of pain when touched to your skin. It comes with quite a few attachments, but we rarely use them. The cord could also be a little longer (we always use an extension cord with it). For occasional use, I recommend. For regular use, I would try another brand."
4,Pretty good,"Comparing to another clipper that I have, which is a magnetic kind also from Andis that I brought nearly 10 years ago.The good: This one cuts more throughly and is lighter to push too. It might give you a false sense that it's not cutting as much hair because it has a more gentle sound.The bad: Blade gets quite hot when touched with skin, it is tolerable, but not pleasant."
2,Don't waste your time...or scrilla,"This is definitely not the best music KG has released. Tru Player is deeply lacking originality and any appeal at all. I couldn't even bear to listen to all the tracks to the end, and the only one I took a real liking to was ""Jackin' Material"". Just the fact that it's got 5 tracks from his previous album (Life Of A Kingpin) tells you this can't be good. I feel like they were thrown in there to fill the gaps. Two of these tracks have been remixed. One remix is ok, but the other one is not so hot. If you want some old King George you'd be wiser to spend a few extra dollars on Life Of A Kingpin, or even one of his compilations, which have a variety of tight artists on them, from Deco-D to Mississippi Mafia. I really like KG, but this album was a real disappointment."
3,Pretty Dope,This CD is probably the best out of the ones he has out. Actually i'll give it 4 stars. RKK. S.L.T. CA.
3,Cow Punk Legends,"if you could only have one cow punk record, this should be it. This is a two lp disk."
3,Decent information but not a Network + study guide.,I'm not exactly sure what this book is intended for. I don't want to give the wrong impression. The material covered is (for the most part) accurate and somewhat useful but other portions of the book are outdated. As a CompTIA Network + exam study guide the book is just about worthless! The book was required text for a college class I took. I would not recommend this book to anyone interested in passing the network + exam. If it wasn't for a great study guide I found on the Internet and a bunch of practice tests I wouldn't have passed.
4,Nice introduction to glow rocks!,"While it might seem a tad expensive; this is a nice reference collection of fluorescent minerals. I started with this set, acquired long and short wave UV lamp; bought a few dozen more rocks on eBay and even discovered the Fluorescent Mineral Society. Now I love to go on field trips with other like-minded people and have another hobby!"
3,Great educational tool,So glad to have found a set of rocks all in one place that have fluorescent properties. However some of the rocks in the set didn't fluoresce very much and were hard to see. I wanted to mix non fluorescing rocks with fluorescing ones so that students could use a black light to separate the two groups. Not as clear cut as I wanted but a good educational tool anyway. I found other rocks at home that fluoresced much brighter such as amber. Wish some of the rocks were a little larger to make handling easier.
5,A Great Television Special,"This is a wonderful t.v. special counting down the top 50 American acting legends.It is done in two parts-the top 25 males and the top 25 females.Even though I disagreed with the ordering of the list, I can't complain over the number one stars. Also, even if your favorite star isn't number one, you can still see clips of there films if they are one the list.Although only 50 stars were honored by the AFI, 50 more introduced them, so that is why it is titled so.Also by the AFI-100 Years 100 Movies, and 100 Years 100 Laughs"
5,Nostalgic and unforgettable,"I saw this TV programme on British television (FILM 4) and I can say that it is well worth a look. It goes through the AFI'S choice of the 50 greatest stars ever to grace Hollywood presented by 50 of today's stars. It provides commentary of the defining roles of such stars as Bogart, Brando, Stewart, Grant and the Hepburn's. It includes such films as THE AFRICAN QUEEN, SUNSET BOULEVARD and THE PUBLIC ENEMY."
2,Some beautiful close-ups,There are some beautiful close-ups of a few planes. And unfortunally that's all. No full description and it's not a guide.
3,Great memory jogger!,"I ordered this holder since I have trouble sometimes remembering if I have taken my bedtime insulin. Now, like my medicine I know at a glance whether I have taken by the daily reminder dates. One problem is the little doors keep popping open, they seem to just open up without any asisstance from me and another problem is I cannot pre fill my syringes and then store them in the container because it is only long enough to hold an empty syringe. But other than that I love the idea for forgetful people like me!"
2,Unconvincing,"This book is a codification and expansion of work done in a pair of articles by Parsons and Peter Woodruff on the topic of vague identity. The expansion doesn't make the work any more convincing, however - especially for those philosophers who find the idea of ontic vague identity suspect to begin with. Nevertheless, it is a decent source for how the Indefinitist may levy vague identity to solve some of those old philosophical chessnuts (e.g., the problem of the many, the ship of theseus, etc.). I'm of the opinion that the ""solutions"" fail even apart from the dubious coherence of vague identity, but it's likely to strike some as right."
5,The elite,"A book that details the infantry,as well as the entire history, and army of Alexander the Great.The pictures and explanation of the army,the sarissas,the terminology,not to mention the physical impact is very well written.You can certainly visualize the battles and what the soldiers went through looking and reading at this book."
2,Biased,"Besides the fact that as an active wargamer i was expecting to see something better on the issue of painted pictures which are not good, i also despise the fact that the author tries hard to impose his personal belief that Macedonian warriors were something different than the rest of the Greek warriors of that time era. While in Persia, Alexander or Eumenes later, might have used translators to give their orders to Persian or Scythian mercenaries, but all in all, the rest of the Greeks could well understand his words and orders since he had have Greek culture and education and was speaking Greek ofcourse.I wonder how would the author feel if i would equally say that an American citizen from Kentucky could not understand a visitor from Oxford because they speak a different language?I was expecting something better on the basis of objective information and not biased beliefes of modern times."
1,astonishingly ridiculous,"This is a shockingly useless book, with more time spent on where to get good facials and spa treatments, and where to get the best iced coffee drinks, than on anything remotely related to acting. Don't waste your money on this: there are tons of much better books on acting in Los Angeles, including Judy Kerr's ""Acting is Everything,"" Kristi Callan's ""Working Actor's Guide,"" or Eve Brandstein's ""The Actor."" Please take the time to check those and other books out before you consider buying this one."
5,For people who are serious about having a career,"If you are looking for a book about instant stardom or easy answers,this is not the book for you. If you want to work hard, have a realistic career,work the steps in this book. Create your life. Create your future and make your tommorow come true by working and doing these steps everyday. A must have! buy,now!!!!!!!! If ur serious in this industry you will read this book!!!!"
5,Helpful,"I found this book to be both helpful, as well as enjoyable. I am new to LA and found, that this guide helped me to feel grounded. It did not provide me with false promises, but strong solid advice on how to get started in the biz.One of the most useful tips came from the chapter on networking and evaluating my personality. This book was definately worth the investment. It is a book to read , re-read , and and reflect back on as you grow and progress."
5,Fabulous,"I loved this book. My friend sent it to me for christmas ,knowing I was moving to LA in Jan. and I am so excited.Not only does it give you great acting and self help tips,It tells you where to get car insurance, where to eat late night, where to get a haircut and so much more. If you are planning to move to LAor go out for pilot season and you don't want to feel like a fish out of water get this book. I'm sending it to my friends who have already been there for a couple of years, because they don't know half of the info in there. It was soo funny and amusing I read it in two nights. Now I'm going to follow the advice in the book and slow down and follow the steps, which are supposed to be done over the course of a year.Hopefully you will see my name in lights soon.Lauren GlassNY"
1,Ridiculous hyping,This book is obviously being hyped by multiple five-star reviews with the same misspellings and sometimes the same verbatim sentences. Look up the listed reviewers and see that many of them are using reviews of other books on the same topic to hype this one. It's too bad people feel the need to resort to this type of behavior.
1,Most of the previous reviewers here are obviously fake,"Most of these reviews of this book are an attempt to sell the book by the author/publisher. Check out all 44+ reviews and you will quickly see a pattern of the same reviewers over and over again.Here is my review. This book is useless. Don't buy it! If you must, borrow it, then you'll see plainly what I mean.There really should be a way for amazon to detect this type of deception that most of the so-called ""reviewers"" have used here."
5,Astounding,"This book is astounding for people who want to become an actor and move to Los Angeles, California."
4,Intuition: Knowing Beyong Logic,".Osho [1931-1990] was very much part of the ""New Wave"" world of intentional communities set up in both India and the United States in the late sixties and early seventies.Osho synthesized his serious scholarly research and his shrewd observations of human nature, creating a fascinating personal philosophy. His lifestyle was not exemplary, but his ideas were fresh and new. Many of his theories make increasing sense as we move forward in time.The book is very readable and you will soon recognize what a gifted teacher he must have been. Some of the jokes and stories he recounts are very funny, others are really old and bad, but all support Osho's main points.""Intuition: Knowing Beyond Logic"" is a book worth pondering and revisiting several times.Kim BurdickStanton, Delaware"
1,Written by an ego-maniac,"Every chapter says pretty much the same thing. It's like when you are driving in the car, and you have that annoying voice running in your head?Reading this book is like reading the dialogue of that voice... except in this case it's the dialogue of an ego-maniac.This guy really thinks he's something special, that much is clear. Problem is that he can't seem to take his own advice - the book is basically him rambling on and on and on - pure mental spew. He is definitely talking the talk... as for walking the walk this guy is doing nothing of the sort, he's way too egotistical to be believable as anything but a salesman who cannot shut up about himself.I bought 3 books by this guy in 1 shot thinking to save money on shipping. Wasted money on 3 books written by someone with a head the size of Mars.What a waste of time and money! You want guidance on meditation or intuition, look elsewhere please!"
1,Don't buy this book,I do not recommend this book to anyone. Osho's views on reality are absurd. Some of the things he says sound like they come out of skeptic magazine. If you're on a spiritual path and you're already dealing with doubt do not read this book!Osho's views don't carry a feeling of hope and love with them but have more of an egotistical ring.Who set this man up to be a Guru? He's not.I'll be using the book as kindling as I cuddle up in front of the fire reading a worth while book.
3,A decent remote,"The remote I got works decently. Everything works except the power window features which is available on the factory unit. The design was ok, however I wish there was tactile sensation on the buttons. You have to physicallly look to press the right button because there is no tactile sensation on the buttons."
1,Boring and Basic,"Perfect... if you've been living under a rock. Extremely disappointing, basic and just plain boring. I runed it twice because I could not believe that was it, I though maybe my DVD had skipped or something.I though it would give information on tableware and how to use it: none.I though it would show beautiful table settings: none -except for a shot of a pinecone place card holder...dah!As for working with a caterer, she actually refers you, in all seriousness, to the phone book!I'M SO UPSET I SPENT ACTUAL $$ ON THIS!"
4,"A complement to ""Building the Great Cathedrals""","Using excellent commentary as well as graphics and animation, this version provides tremendous insight to the technical aspects provided in the other DVD."
3,French Gothic Cathedrals,"The one narrow type of French Gothic cathedrals that is the subject of this video were constructed by Catholic cities mostly where bishops resided in or near France. The flying buttress that allowed the height andstained glass windows is discussed as well as the hardships the constructions forced on the economics of these cities.The narrow time period if about 1100-1300 ad while the catholic Church andfeudal Europe ruled. In the middle ages other types of cathedralswere being constructed and even in other religions.The architectural ignorance of the builders sort of added to the building style? This video is somewhat better than the one called Castle,but both are much too narrow in approach for my liking."
4,Creative historical fiction,"I wasn't sure quite what to expect after finding this book in a bargain bin at the store. It looked intriguing enough, So I picked it up. It's a nice story told in first-person perspective by a woman briefly mentioned in the Bible. Since this is entirely in her POV, much of what led to Jesus' death is omitted, so if you're looking for a book about Jesus, look elsewhere. It was a fairly quick but enjoyable read for me, though I wish this book could have gone with a bit more description, some of the parts felt dry and it was hard for me to actually imagine their surroundings or what they were wearing due to the sparsness of description."
2,low vision watch,"purchased as Christmas gift for my 80 year old father.he has mac. deg. & also losing dexterity in his handsthe large contrasting numbers on face wre good;butwhen watch arrived it had a leather band that require good hand dexterity to fasten instead of the stretch gold band that was shown.I e-mailed the supplier , but got NO response.i had to buy him a new band that he could use that cost an additional +$10"
5,good value,I ordered this item and also the ladies model of this watch and gave my mother the choice of them. She chose the man's watch because it is easier to find the buttons on the larger watch. She has used it for 3 weeks and loves it.
4,He loved it!,My father loved this Low vision Talking Watch. Perfect gift for someone with vision problems. I wish the volume was a little higher as he also has problems with his hearing .
1,Avalon Talking Watch,My husband is legally blind and so looked forward to this talking watch. We received a defective watch. The buttons to set the functions do not work. Now I will have to send it back at my own expense! Very disappointed in this product.
3,Not bad,"These gloves were fine when i first got them, but either due to age or because i left them in my hot car too long, they lost their grip. I now need new gloves because there is actually less friction than using my hands."
5,They get the job done,"I bought these binoculars to take with me on a vacation where we would be looking at local birds and wildlife in the trees. It was the perfect size beacuse it folds up and is very compact. The magnification is obviously not as good as a larger more expensive pair, but they got the job done for I needed them for. I was able to clearly focus and see animals that where high up in the trees. I was very happy with them."
4,Nice product,Nice product for price. Clear and able to focus extremely well. Us old duffers usually have a problem with that focus part so these seem to work great and no problems.
2,Underwhelmed ... Better options for less money.,"What can I say? ... These are lame and I don't like them.I purchased a smaller pair of Celestrons, ... cheaper and better.I would rather have had two pair of the celestrons, in THIS price range.I like Bushnell ... some of their higher end products are worth having.But, here, at the low end? ... Well, THESE binoculars just don't cut it.Look at the options, from Celestron, in this price range.On the high end? ... The situation may (likely) be reversed ...TOTALLY depends on the exact model and ... THIS model ? ... meh.I'll pass these along to my 18 year old daughter, for HER pack.TWO STARS"
5,One Of My All-time Faves!,"Yes indeed, this is a dark recording with great lyrics, catchy rythems, and excellent muscianship. Saul's voice has a natural sadness that adds such meaning and depth to the song's messages. My fave is ""Viento"", also ""matenme..."", ""Te Estoy Mirando"" y ""¿Sera Por Eso?"". Add this to your collection for sure if you have not yet done so."
4,Delicious and mostly healthy,"I really like the flavors of this dish. Pecan and garlic are the main ones, with some of the nuttiness of the grains coming through as well. The only issue I have is the salt content, which is common in boxed grains. Now I find out it is kosher, too!"
3,Would not order again,"Shipment ordered with little time to the expiration date, which was a bummer. I would not order again because of this. I will have to toss some since they are coding before they can be consumed."
5,Rock solid wheels,"These wheels are simply the best ever for the bucks. Strong and good looking in either natural aluminum or black. Consistant high quality and they reqire very little if any adjustment upon installation. They track true and solid. I've put over 15,000 miles on my first set of these and at this price or even twice as much they are an excellent buy.Sid"
3,Specialized workbook,"An interesting little workbook, designed to be used with something called the Olympus WigJig, a transparent wire bending jig. If, like me, you have never heard of this device, the book gives no information on how to obtain or make the jig. Fortunately, the designs can be made without the jig. The designs, while interesting, are copyrighted. Why does the author give us copyrighted designs for a mass-production jig? The book is strictly for beginners who are interested in simple wire bending without using soldering or any advanced techniques."
2,Wonderful but not really wearable,"The book has lots of good design. Unfortunately, as an adult, I do not think I would wear the work instructed in the book."
1,Disappointing,"Muddy image, dull and lifeless was my first impression. For example, I then tried a pair of Nikon Monarch 10x42's, and was stunned by the comparative brightness and liveliness. If you can afford to spend more now, or wait and spend more, your eyes will be rewarded for many many years to come."
4,Exactly What I Wanted,"These binoculars are exactly what I needed and exactly what I expected after reading about them and researching on line. Excellent quality (a bit heavy but well made). I am using these for bird watching as well as on my boat (which was the main reason I needed waterproof). So far, so good."
2,"Low price, high quality","I was looking for a pair of roof-prism binoculars like this, for hawk and bird watching. I had looked at Swarovskis, but they were way out of my budget, nearly a thousand dollars for this resolution.These binoculars are crystal-clear, with sharp focus. The 42mm lens lets in lots of light, lots more than the 35's I've been using. I wear glasses and the twist- up- and -down eyecups are a blessing. There are also attached lens protectors for the 42mm, nice because I always used to lose them.For the price, these can't be beat."
4,ok,"the binoculars is ok, though not as good as I had expected. but on the whole, good product and good seller."
4,Crafty,"Perfect size also light weight. They are fog proof, as claimed, which is important where we live and how we use these binoculars."
1,For Small Faces Only,"I found that unfortunately the eye-to-eye distance (Exit pupil) with this pair is not sufficient. Since I never had this problem with other binoculars, I believe it must be due to the design. Of course I returned the binoculars, but a simple warning or alert would have been preferable to the purchase and return hassle and cost."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS---unless its USB2 you use,same problem as other reviewer and anyone else using devices with the Prolific PL3507 firewire controller..the dive will suddenly become useless as in you will ahve to reformat it to get it to work for a short time before it becomes unreadable again.I plan on returning mine or getting some sort of restitution.Apparently the USB2 part works fine
1,Lost data,It's doesn't work properly.I lost all data on it 3 times.Only fullformat can return it to normal condition and aftersome time I get the error again.
1,Unreliable. Stopped working after less than six months.,"I had two of these devices fail on me in the span of one year! I bought this device with the intention of doing backups to a small group of servers in my workplace. One day I plugged in the USB 2.0 interface and nothing happened. The Power LED came on, but none of my computers would recognize the drive. Thank goodness the hard drive (and my data) was still intact. I had the hard drive removed and placed into another SimpleTech hard drive enclosure. It worked fine for about six months, then yesterday the same thing happened again! The hard drive comes on but my computers could not see it. I will never ever buy another SimpleTech product again."
2,Disappointing,"It is misleading to tell the potential reader that he/she will receive ""350 flower fairy scraps""--actually what is contained are 26 actual flower fairy pictures (14 fairies, some repeated multiple times) and the rest are little bits of flowers, leaves and petals which comprise the remaining 324 pieces! I was expecting 350 flower fairy snippets for the projects. The quality of the art work and reproduction is good and the projects are fine. But the ""350"" number is highly misleading, I think. I knew that low cost was too good to be true!!!"
3,ok product,I use heat on my hair daily so it is obviously damaged. I wanted to find a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner to help improve it. This product smells decent and sudz up pretty well but I really did not see any change to my hair.
2,Far too little real problem/solutions,"Lacks alternative scheduling, decent memory layout, data placement for minimal motion, deterministic I/O - can be used for hobbiest - I don't recommend this book for education. It is a good novelty item and not quite a 'Dan Saks how do code so you can't maintain it' book. But, close."
3,Micromonitor Source Code With Comments,"The bulk of Embedded Systems Firmware Demystified consists of source code listings for the author's ""Micromonitor"" generic embedded operating system and comments. Chapters not dealing with this code are very informative, but lack graphics and photos. The author's extensive and valuble experience shines through and makes great reading, but overall the book did not demistify firmware for me."
5,Excellent book covering embedded software concepts!,"This is a must have book someone needing to learn the concepts of embedded software. It's written very well, is easy to understand, and is applicable to just about any processor platform. It covers the various hardware components found in modern embedded systems as well as driver implementations and topics like what to expect 'just after reset'. The CD contains the source code for a program called the MicroMonitor as well as the GNU X-Tools compiler for building it. It provides invaluable examples and details on how to port the MicroMonitor to a new platform and covers details about the source code and how the flash file system works. Overall, an excellent book!!!"
5,Women of Courage and Bravery,Even though I am only a girl of twelve I felt very moved by this book. I felt as if I wanted to do the things that they did. This book did a wonderful job describing what women as nurses in the Red Cross did during WWII. It shows women can do just as good as men. This book recognizes the bravery and courage of women in combat zones and the challenges and hardships they overcame.I think that people of today should give more recognition to the nurses and WASPs of WWII and that is what this book has done. They give me courage to do things I didn't think I could do. If you enjoy this book you might enjoy On Silver Wings as I have.
2,Disappointing!,"I assumed I would be receiving an ""academic"" book discussing the lives of US nurses during World War II. Instead, it was simply a ""coffee table"" book full of mostly pictures. I would recommend ""We Band of Angels"" to a reader that wishes to learn more about the sacrifices of the brave women who fought as nurses during World War II."
4,"Decent book, terrible acknowledgments","My mother was one of the women Betsy Kuhn interviewed for this book. Kuhn opted not to use any of my mother's quotes. This is within her rights as author, but on the page in which she acknowledged her sources she failed to thank my mother for her time. Like so many WWII era vets, my mother is approaching 80 years of age. It would have been a kick for her to see her name in print even if only as part of a longer list of names. I gave her this book knowing she'd been interviewed by its author, but it ended up being something of a disaster when she discovered that several close friends from her unit were prominently featured in the book while she got nada, zip, zero. I sincerely hope Betsy Kuhn sees this and feels a moment or two of remorse for hurting the feelings of a wonderful woman who I'm proud to call my mother because she really is an Angel."
1,will not keep time,"This watch will not keep time consistently. Will work fine a few days, then quits and has to be reset. I grew tired of it, threw it against the wall into a million pieces and will never buy another watch on the internet."
2,not worth the money,"For $78.00 I didn't think that it was worth it. First it was a paperback. Black and white photos. I was hoping to get more photos of Meissen pieces. It's not as detailed as expected. The only good thing about it is it shows examples of markings per their dated period. Please, don't spend that much on this book!"
5,Thank you for a fast delivery,I needed it in emergency situation as I lost my nose piercing and I am so fussy about the size so I am grateful for the fast delivery of this item..
3,Too small,"These fit the description--they are very tiny; much more tiny than I imagined. I'm returning these just because they're too small for my second piercing, but I can't complain much because they're exactly what they say they are! These would probably work better as a nose stud, not an earring. I've been very pleased with my other orders from Sabrina Silver, though, and would definitely recommend them to anyone."
5,Perfect for a nose ring,I have been looking for a very tiny stud for my nose and this worked perfectly. Just bent the tip a little.
3,So Tiny!,These were so tiny that they went right through! I just got my nose pierced and wanted something for days when I needed to be more discreet. I can't wear these. I am so sad. Love Sabrina Silver. Won't rate them really low because they have wonderful jewelry..but these did not work for me.
1,Craptacular,"Maybe I got a lemon.....looking through the binoculars, you get a double image; like the left eye monocular was not pointing in the same direction as the right eye monocular. No amount of adjusting both lens's or the right monocular would fix this. Into the trash these go........gonna have to dig deeper in the wallet to get a pair that works."
5,Very Good...I replaced a Lost Book with this...,I loaned my old book out that I got in the early 1970's and couldn't find it. This book was a nice replacement. Has original dust cover and in great condition.
4,A new twist on pet food...,"Some of Freymann's doggie creations are much better than others, but this entire book is filled with very creative food sculptures of man's best friend. I showed the book to my friend's little boy and he was completely creeped out by it, so I don't think this is a book that should be given to very young children. Adults who have a whimsical sense of humor will definitely enjoy it (and you'll never look at a banana the same way after reading this book!)."
5,My toddler loves this book!,"My 2 year old son loves this book! It is so unique and imaginative, I think it fosters creativity in him, too. He enjoys naming the dogs - Broccoli Dog or Pepper Dog- and the stories told on each page - he loves Puppy Love and Hot Dog.I think this book would be great for kids and foodies alike!"
3,Over sized,"Over sized, even with insert provided. Return was without hassle all though I ended up paying the postage both ways"
5,I LOVE MY PINK OUTBACK TOYO COWBOY HAT !!!,I wasn't sure I could fine the right cowboy hat for Lake Tahoe CA - the hat had to be pretty yet within my price range.I went out to amazon.com and typed in pink cowboy hat and there it appeared !!! I ordered it and within three days it was delivered.So much easier than going shopping and spending all that gas money.It fits perfect and looks great.Thank you !!!!!
3,good but scarce and non-fully illustraded advice,"The advice in this DVD is good: Ms. Kern spends most of the time filming a table, explaining in detail how to navigate your way in several table settings, what each utensile and plate is for, what is the correct order for glasses, how to hold the fork, etc. However, in that long sequence she is alone and the plates and glasses are empty. Thus, for instance, when she describes how to interact with the other guests at the table or deal with the food in front of you she is just describing what you should do instead of actually showing you what to do. Well a book can do that. I bought a DVD on etiquette expecting to see a display of good manners rather than, mostly, having them described to me. Nevertheless, I was not able to find a better DVD on etiquette so I would recommend this one."
2,manners 70's style,It's my own fault for not researching this more. This is fine if you are wanting to serve high society but definitely wouldn't fly with high school students. Decided to shelf this one rather than risk their rath and being forced to watch something that in no way relates to them. Keep in mind I teach in a very affluent suburb of the city.
4,Castle Society,"I found the video to be very usefull especially with mid high students. It has a comprehensive approach to castle building as well as the people who live in it, and the culture. I recomend it to anyone teaching social studies."
3,all about Welsh castles of the middle ages,"Since there were German castles ( like Neuschwanstein Castle) which are much more famous than the Castle Conway which this movie seems to have been based on.The impression that the building of castles or forts were abandoned after cannon were invented given by this video is just wrong.I did like the pictures of Welsh castles and the animated story, butif people get the impression that this is all there isabout castles, they will get the wrong impression.The Spanish build a star shaped castle in Puerto Ricocalled Fort San Felipe del Morro in 1587: a good 300 years after these Welsh castles."
4,Dated but good,"A little old fashioned, (it was made in 1983) but very informative and my children (7 and 10 ) enjoyed it."
3,Great ideas,"I really enjoyed reading this book. The ideas and concepts are VERY interesting. The reason for the 3 stars instead of 4 or 5 is due to the fact that the writing itself needs improvement. The ideas presented are better than the prose, and I am hoping that Kimmel's other books see improvement in that area. I would recommend this to friends."
2,Beware the Quality of the Craft,"Aside from standard issues in doll clothing production (unraveling gold strings and all that), what really rendered my view of the doll in the negative was the style of articulation, especially in the hip area. Instead of something sturdy like a ball and socket, the top of the leg houses a pin that's supposed to marry to the torso. Well lemme tell you, one good tumble and you can kiss that system good-bye. Now I've got a doll with beautiful hair, poor constructed clothing, and odd proportions who only has one functional leg.If you're the type of collector who handles the box with care, then by all means pick this girl up. But if you like to pose your dolls for display, then avoid this one at all cost."
1,Not very helpful.,"The title of this book promises helpful information but unfortunately it doesn't deliver. While the author provides many home-based business suggestions, many are rather unreasonable and/or impractical. For the few seemingly legitimate suggestions he provides, he gives no real practical information in how to get started. I found this book so useless that I returned it!"
1,Disappointed,"In my opinion, the book does not offer concrete ideas, but serves to market the author's numerous other products."
1,THIS BOOK ISN'T WORTH THE PAPER IT'S PRINTED ON,"The 3 reasons not to buy this book:1. The earnings potential in this book are very unrealistic. It seems as if you can be rich with almost no work.2. Some of the business concepts are absurd(i.e. a service that uses dogs to chase ducks away from your property)3. The author does not have your success in mind, he just wants to sell you his books and newsletters."

4,Awesome book for kid meals and ideas,"I was given this book when my son was about 1 1/2. IT's awesome! Lots of great recipes and ideas for picky eaters and all kids. There are great, easy recipes, that are healthy and delicious. My son is now 6 and we used it for both of my kids up until about a year ago when we moved and now I'm KICKING myself for getting rid of it. I miss this book! You won't be disappointed if you're looking for simple, healthy meals for your little one's."
2,"OK,,, BUT","The mix is easy to use but seems to be weak to the taste,, I add some liquid lime juice to add flavor... will keep on using this product"
3,A good but not great mix,"I like this product because it's a powder that keeps for a long time and is packaged for individual servings. However, the flavor is not as good as liquid mixers or homemade. Overall, I would not recommend this to a friend."
3,Margarita Mix,The reason we purchased this product was because it was individually packaged. That was awesome. It actually had more of a lemonade flavor not so much lime. But it was great for what we needed it for.
4,Excellent reading for Sunday afternoon under a shady tree,"This was the first book by Judith Gould I had read. Usually I take myself in to the mystery aisles and stay away from romances; however, I was pleasantly surprised and found myself reading this book in 2 days. It is a page turner which anyone will enjoy with a very good ending."
5,BEST OF THE BEAT,"This is the perfect compilation from a great English pop/reggae band, and once and for all, the band's name is simply The Beat. (In the USA, another lesser band beat this one to the naming punch, hence the dreadful ""English Beat"" moniker.) I had the good fortune to catch two live Beat shows, one at Roseland NYC, the other in a club across from Fenway in Boston, and if I had to create my own ""greatest of"" collection, it would sound a lot like this CD. There is not a bad track on it, and the sequencing is superb. If we can't experience a reunion tour, this will most certainly serve as a great substitute."
3,"Great markers, terrible price","As far as the markers go I give those five stars, wide color range, the double end allows one to draw 4 different lines & Prisma uses a low odor alcohol as solvent, so they don't have the harmful stink of old type markers. But I have to say the prices charged by all Amazon sellers for them are very high compared to other online art companies."
1,Cheap China Made,"These were okay as far as viewing, but drop them from a barn loft about 10 feet up and they split in half.. very cheap"
5,Great pair of binoculars,"These binoculars were a gift for my husband, and he absolutely LOVES them! We could not believe how clear the picture is through them and how close the object appears. We were looking at a tower quite a ways from our house, and it was so clear that it seemed as if you could almost touch it. Unfortunately, for us, my little cousin dropped them while looking through them, and that messed up the picture a little. So, be careful not to drop them be3cause it may cause visibility issues."
2,Ehhhh,I know nothing about binoculars when I made this purchase for a trip but really had much higher expectations. After not much use they got out of focus and my husband and I just couldn't figure out how to get them to work normally again. Wouldn't recommend.
3,Had some flaws,I purchased these for my wife just before our trip to Alaska. While there the strap holder broke off causing the binoculars to fall from her neck. They were fine but then she had to carry them in her hands the rest of the trip. The optics were fine though.
4,Works well and durable,"At first I wasnt overly happy with these Bino's, I just couldnt seem to focus them correctly. I found it irritating that I couldn't see as clearly as I could when using a pair of the same brand/type which are the 10x50 instead of the 10x25. That is until I was slipped and fell while walking across a stream on a wet log in the forest. I turns out I landed on them and popped one of the oculars off the frame. I was sure they were toast but after forcing them back together they now work better than when they were new! Sounds crazy, but they are very durable and very water proof. By the end of the hunting trip, all the guys with the bigger binocoulars told me they wish they had gotten this compact pair instead."
3,Feel a little ripped off,"Not 3', more like 35"" and the ends were torn or ripped instead of cut so they need to be cut which will take a little more from the length."
4,sad,"I don't think I am in a position to judge Ann's research or accuracy on Autism,but I found it an interesting and sad book.I think,perhaps,Ann should have explained better that Susan was actually a genius,and the word retarted may have featured a few too many times.*Kristy's kind heart is shown in this story as she is desperate to reach Susan who is lost in some world of her own.Kristy also tries to get through to the bullies who make fun of Susan."
2,An OK book but not one of the best,When Kristy is sitting for an autistic girl she tries to get her to come out of her own little world but is unsuccessful.
1,Piece of garbage.,"Save yourself a lot of time and frustration and look elsewhere for a quality product. I have had to have the repair guy come out 6 times in the first year (knock on wood, the first year is not finished yet). Of course, each appointment wastes an entire day, because I'm held hostage waiting for the doofus to show up. Maytag just does not make quality products anymore. It shouldn't break in the first place and the service is horrible."
5,Daniel O'Donnell,"If you like the oldies, this CD is for you. It covers a lot of the jukebox favorites from the past. Daniel is a true entertainer."
5,Aime Cesaire: The Collected Poetry,"A superb bi-lingual presentation of this 20th-century literary titan, whose writings continue to resonate into the 21st century. Vive la difference!"
5,Viva Cesaire,"Through Cesaire's poetry I can see where maybe some of the Beats and Jayne Cortez got some of their riffs. This poetry was some of the first with its themes of black empowerment against colonialism and racism but its language is still cutting edge. It's angry and surreal which reminds me of Rimbaud but it has a whole rhythmic chant-like vibe all its own. Then there's the amazing island and flora and fauna imagery to add to the exoticism and even a hint of voodoo, like the reproductions of Wilfredo Lam's paintings scattered through the book. It's definitely more high energy than most of the Surrealists I've read. If you like the Surrealists, the Beats and Jayne Cortez, you'll love this."
2,Didn't work in laptop...,"The disc wouldn't work in laptop... got it for under a buck. Disappointed but, oh well... too good to be true..."
5,"Gretzky, need I say more?",I saw this live and the DVD captures everything and more. There are lots of extra's on this DVD and it is well worth the price.
2,Interesting,"I have been teaching women's self defense since 1975 (which is not to say I know any or everything). While the production is great, and pushing info out to women to protect themselves is great, what I see is the typical ""martial arts"" stuff, sprinkled with safety and security info. Susan007"
4,Spell binding story,Although the story has been told before Cheryl brings it to you in her own special way and I loved it. This is a story of the stuck up pretty girl Sabrina who uses each and everyone in her path and keeping it real friend Jamilah. They have been friends for over 10 years and roommates for three. Their relationship turns sour when Jamilah takes off her blinders about Sabrina and sees her for the person that she really is. Needless to say there is a man involved but it's not your typical story and you will find yourself relating to the characters and the situations that occur. You must read this book. I found it highly entertaining and I would recommend it to anyone.
5,It stuck with me,"I was just thinking about this novel. For the life of me, I could not remember the title- because I read it over a year ago- so I went web browsing, typing in certain parts of the plot, and I found it! It is a great novel! I actually borrowed from a friend the first time I read it, but I am about to buy for myself now and reread it."
5,Cheryl Faye is BACK!,"I have to start off with...WOW! It's been a while since we've ""heard"" from Ms. Faye, but boy did she come back with a book to knock us off our feet. This tale of two friends was quite a page turner from the very beginning. I'm not going to repeat the synopsis as it's been referenced enough. I just want to say that the story of Jamilah, the average-sized beauty, and Darius is just breathtaking. I couldn't get enough of the unveiling love and romance between them. Ms. Faye did an excellent job developing those two. Also, the story of Sabrina dealing with the physical and emotional abuse was very touching. Ms. Faye did a wonderful job giving her readers a look into what abused women are subjected to. It was nice to see Sabrina change her tune and find a real man. Hats off to Ms. Faye! PLEASE don't make us wait this long again."
3,Good Reading,This story had some really high points then at times it would slow down. Overall the author did a good job. I Liked the party scenes as well as the scenes with Sabrina and her boyfriend.It was nice to see a main character not having the traditional shape but still being wanted by the opposite sex. Cause' we all know beauty comes from within.
2,Necklace not as advertised,"When I received this is the mail I was disappointed. It did not sparkle as my other Swarovksi pieces and the silver cheapens the look. I expected more crystals and less silver- unfortunately I did not get what was pictured. I even contacted the seller to see about returning it. The only reason I kept this over-priced piece was because I had also purchased the matching earrings and bracelet. The bracelet (the one with just crystals, no silver beads) is stunning and the earrings are decent."
5,You will love it,"I gifted it to my wife birthday with the set of Earring and bracelet, she loves it. And lot of people appriciated the looks. There is no doubt this is Swarovski. Buy with confidence you will love it."
3,Wish the speakers worked better,"I really like everything about this stroller except for the music on the go feature (the main reason I bought this stroller). All I can hear is the background singers, you can't hear the main song. Also, the speakers are pointed directly at my daughter, so the volume has to be fairly low to keep from blasting her ears, and therefore makes it difficult for me to hear. Love the rest of the stroller though!"
3,I am not coordinated,"I was a 'true' beginner and I couldn't keep myself balanced. I am sure it was me, but only used this a couple times before I gave it to a friend. She uses it all the time so she is probably more coordinated than me."
5,Tex Williams CD,I bought Tex Williams CD as a present for my FIL and he has enjoyed playing it very much on his Boise Radio and CD player.
5,Food Remedies,Great reference book. Easy to read and understand. Very well organized. Great natural food suggestions and great recipes too. We first got the book at the library and loved it so much we had to buy it.
3,Basic information,"Most of the information is a rehash of conventional mainstream thinking...which is often incorrect. i.e. dairy is great source of calcium. While technically correct, this source of calcium is not readily absorbed in the body. The author actually encourages a 50% carbohydrate diet for diabetics!"
2,Dar Tellum,"Dar Tellum is an illustrated children's chapter book about a young boy, Ralph, who receives telepathic communication (thought transmissions) from an alien on another planet. After the initial contact, attempting to tell his mother gets a sour reaction, so Ralph decides not to tell anyone again. Ralph's father is a scientist trying to solve flooding due to the green house effect, and Ralph receives info from Dar Tellum that might help. Unfortunately, as sci-fi stories go, this one's somewhat flawed, which detracts from the educational value that it could have had as a children's book. Also, the narrative style, with little dialog, probably isn't appealing to most young readers. It also seems to tell youngsters not to confide in their own parents."
3,"Good Book, Needs More Pictures","This book, while an excellent publication by the Victoria & Albert Museum in London, England, is not as interesting as some might lead you to believe.Admittedly, the dresses in this book are astounding (you should flip through this book at least once to see them) ... but there are very few pictures of Queen Maud wearing any of the items themselves. The pictures are also quite small and seem dwarfed by the writing below them.Overall, I give this book 3 stars, because while it is interesting, it is definitely not something you would want to look at again and again. Don't waste your money ... just rent it from the library!"
5,Definitely Style,"It's not a large book only 105 pages, but the fashions of this period are glorious, to the everyday. I think that it's a good addition to my reference library for designers of the period. Many of the designers are London or Paris and there are complete descriptions of each item. Queen Maud was the granddaughter of Queen Victoria and definitely had a sense of style, there are also a number of black and white ""family"" photos throughout."
1,Not even a whole star,"This DVD was more than disappointing. It's a rip off. It's bad quality short films. The best thing about it is the picture on the cover. It's pretty much small children in oversized diapers acting too much like adults. It's difficult to understand the dialogue, and when you do - you just think about how horrible it was that people ever found this amusing. I love Shirley Temple movies, but this is no collection I ever want to own, or pass off on to any unsuspecting fan. The film quality is poor - and at least one of the DVD links took me to the film before rather than the film it was titled to take me to. Whoever came up with this collection was more interested in making money than producing a quality product. I will never buy another 'Passport Productions Video.'"
1,The Shirley Temple Collection,"Disapointed in this collection as there was only one movie and the other four disks were early short features.It must be why the sellers of these collections give as little info as possible, my granddaughter I were truly sad when it wasn't the 5 movies we had been led to believe was coming. This has left me very uneasy doing business this way, buyer beware.R.J. Allen"
1,"All I have to say is,,,ARE YOU KIDDING ME?","My mom received this set for her birthday and when she and I sat down to watch it we were half amused and half appauled. I don't mean to overexaggerate the situation, but the subject matter, if you read the summaries on the back of the box, seem to be a little racy and questionable. Shirley Temple as a burlesque performer? A prostitute. Ummm... yeah."
3,Lemonade,"Chose this DVD while browsing Amazon. Pretty good stories of how people can still find their dreams even after their daily life has changed dramatically. This is a great motivational film to those who are lazy like me, or to those having job changes etc. I only wish the film was longer."
1,Not worth getting..,"This was my first card and i was very dissapointed. It's core clock is about 411 and memory around 360,""overclocked didnt improve much , 420 core and 369 memory, but it overheats very fast and cannot handle just about any game i have played ""meaning"" i have high frame rates and games are just about to glitchy to have fun. I run 2 gigs of ram, 280 gig of hard drive space, intell P4 2.8. I used Radlinker, omega drivers and the ati tray tool.I would have rather baught a Geforce 6600 128mb witch i found out performs this one by a landslide. Overall i regreat buying this card at $500 when it first came out. I would not suggest this card to anyone."
4,Oiling Set,"Love it, my husband always left bowl of oil and papertowels laying around. It would be nice if there was some type of clasp to lock the lid on. We keep it closed with a rubber band."
5,Brightest and Best,"Searching out appropriate Christmas music from the Appalachian tradition, among a motley crew, this was by far the best, some instrumentals, some a cappella, some accompanied. Well balanced selections, and with a very fine insert explanation of the songs' histories and backgrounds. Like all Ritchie's works, this album reflects a deep traditional sincerity."
3,Of Limited Interest,"The best single piece on this album is ""The World is Old Tonight."" It shows the group's ability to improvise and create fascinating sounds. The remainder of the album is of variable interest, but it's great that someone took the time and trouble to preserve a genre of regional music that would otherwise be completely forgotten."
3,"Good program, but needed teaching material,","It is an excellenct tool to teach global marketing for a class. As a teacher, I need more information on teaching material. Without the additional teaching package, it would work by itself."
3,The Lies We Believe,It is a decent book but after awhile it became boring for me and after I read half of it I put it down.
3,Long winded reading,I bought this book being recommended by others. When I said it was a long winded book by that I meant that I found the first half of the book intereting but with some off the beatin path detours and when I got past the half way point I became less interested in this book because the detours became more and more getting away from the story it was surpose to be telling. I think it was worth reading because I did get some enjoyment out of the book and think others will enjoy it also.
5,A non-fiction story that is scripture based,"This book is a wonderful resource that has helped me to understand the issues surrounding homosexuality and the Christian faith in an honest and scripture-based way.Unlike Oliver's review, this book is not a ""feel good"" book where the author just dismisses what the Bible says about this topic, and what it DOESN'T say about it. Nor does Sundby just read the bible to only hear what she wants to. Reverend Sundby goes through ALL the motions of studying scripture accurately and with the willingness to accept the truth it is speaking to her, including a possible ""anti-gay relationship"" interpretation that Oliver believes is the only right interpretation.What makes this book refreshing is not only is it scholarly, but it is written in the context of her life story. For many readers this book will help them understand a lesbian Christian's life and her quest to understand what God is saying about her life. Highly recommended!"
5,Great costume for children!,"My son wore this costume for his first Halloween (see the customer image picture I posted above) and just loved it. Spider-Man is his favorite super hero and he barely could contain his excitement. The only issue the Mrs. and I found was that the drawstring mask just didn't work. If you have children, you know that infants tend to not take a liking to things around their head and will inevitably take it off. And lest he should try to pull it off the wrong way and choke himself, the Mrs. fastened the mask to a pair of sunglasses that our boy didn't mind. In addition, the costume does not include a pair of red socks which we had to buy separately (why the boy in the main Amazon picture is wearing blue socks is beyond me. I mean c'mon get it right kid!). Besides this the costume was (dare I say it) amazing!Caesar says thumbs up!"
1,How much research went into this?,"I'll admit I haven't read the book, but why should I? The breed's name is the Sphynx not sphinx. If the title's incorrect what about the information? I'll wait until there's a book that at least has the breed's name right."
1,THE WORST.,"The discs werent working and they were blankly designed, obvious fakes and in worst condition ! do not buy it at all !"
4,An amazing journey.,"As a social worker who works with disabled children I often lay awake at night worrying about their future. I Toss and turn thinking about how they will grow and become independent.This groundbreaking TV series turned my fears into hope for a better tomorrow. Paris and Nicole (2 mentally challenged women) join the work force to gain independence while overcoming life's obstacles to prove that with enough support and perseverance that they can face any challenge headstrong and not let their illness get the best of them. It's a wonderful attitude to teach to any of the kids I work with.I Only gave it 4 stars because in some of the episodes they fire the women which seems cruel, especially to someone in their situation."
5,The Simple Life 3,"I just got the Simple Life 3 on DVD last night as a present. So far, i have watched 15 of the 16 episodes straight through. Paris and Nicole are SO funny! One of the only things i was disappointed with was that there were no special features. In the other Simple LIfe DVD's, they had things they cut out, bonus episodes, etc., and that is a feature missing in the 3rd installment. I really recommend this to anyone who has watched and liked the oher Simple Lifes, and to anyone who needs a good laugh."
5,Best season of all,"There is no question about it, if you are a Simple Life fan, that this is the best season. Nicole and Paris have buried their personal feud hatchet so hopefully season 5 will be as good as 3!"
4,Like a train wreck :-l,"For some bizzare reason, I would punish myself week after week by watching this. It must have had some 'good' aspect to it in order to watch it every week, but looking back, I can't think of many. I think I enjoyed watching these girls look like idiots the majority of the time. They are beyond ditzy and without a doubt, most situations here were definate set ups. One family they stayed with, the girls went with the sons to a gym and whilst the guys were showering, Paris and Nicole stole their clothes and the guys walked home with towels. Now come on. Like that wasn't a set up. Spilling ashes from an urn at a funeral parlor and vacuuming it up? Again - a set up. Obviously you don't have to concentrate on this a lot; I think I just watched (and rated it 4 stars) for the laugh factor. Not because they are funny, but because it makes a 5 year old look mature and smart."
1,Socially bankrupt and a decline in humanity...,"If you think that two girly retards acting dumb and getting fired everyday is funny hit ""no"".If you think that this sucks hit ""yes"".Thus says The Metal Master 92..."
5,brilliant,"Fox's book is a brilliant synthesis of the compelling philosophical, environmental, health, moral, political, cultural, and spiritual reasons for vegetarianism. The real strength of this broad-based ""reader"" is its ability to bring these diverse arguments together as a coherent whole, while presenting counter-arguments with a fair and balanced hand. ""Deep Vegetarianism"" is written in an accessible, non-dogmatic style that is sure to be enjoyed by anyone with a passing interest in the subject. Highly recommended!"
5,Excellent Satire,"I think of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas whenever I read this richly illustrated novel. Captain Freebird is who Hunter S. Thompson would be if he were a superhero. He isn't the nicest guy, and he is very cynical, but deep in his heart he still believes in the dream that is America. Be prepared for a uncompromising look at the dark side of that dream, but be comforted in knowing that Captain Freebird is out there trying to make it a little bit better."
4,German Camoflage of World War II,"This book goes over camouflage schemes and markings of German military vehicles covering the entire range of war years. And all fronts. The book has many nice black and white war time photos. They show the various vehicles with they vast variety of schemes used. And the different methods used to apply them.Though I love the photo's, they are no very easy to use for reference in painting. But there are color plates of the various camouflage schemes shown in the photos and discussed. These will come in very handy for the modeler. I found that the color plates and war time photos are not duplicated from volume to volume. Making getting the series worth while."
4,Nice watch but no FLIX system,"I purchased this watch because of the FLIX system. I fly at night and the ability to just ""flick"" my wrist to activate the light would be helpful.After going crazy and walking around in a dark bathroom flicking my wrists, I figured out that it does NOT have the FLIX system on it.Although I did return this watch, I did like it for the moment that I had it. It was the perfect size, very comfortable and easy to navigate. It was disappointing to send it back but it just won't work for me. If you don't care about the FLIX system then it's a great buy."
2,Not what I thought it would be,"This is a very nice watch that I'm sure would be great to have. However, the picture is very misleading. When the watch arrived, it was almost unrecognizable from the picture. It was larger than I expected (the picture is about the size of the actual item, as it turns out) and the silver-gray color is more metallic than it seems in the picture. I purchased this as a gift for someone, but when it came in I could tell it wasn't what he wanted. I gave it anyway with the option of returning it, which the recipient decided was the best thing to do. He went online later to find a replacement, and the link he sent me was this exact watch: that's how different it looked. So all in all, I'm sure it's a great watch, but it wasn't at all what I thought I was buying."
4,Bowie meets Aquabats in Spanish???,"This is a decent recording, with some downright kinky and weird songs. Reasons to buy this CD include: the lead singer's David Bowie-like voice, the wacky tracks like ""Los Cibernoides"" and ""Maten al DJ."" Still, this isn't exactly one of the best albums out there. Numerous songs are dull and forgettable. Despite its limitations, if you like funny songs or punk music in Spanish, it might be worth checking out."
3,OK,This is OK- if you alreay have their last one- 2002 cd- Celestial- this is nothing new- Im kind of dissapointed- Their last one is a lot better.
3,Good- but nothing quite new,"Well, I'll say this- If you dont have any Pagan's Mind, YEAH- pick this one up. Its good. If you have their other two- well, this album sorta sounds a lot like their other stuff. The Last song is quite awesome, but other than that, its kinda more of the same. They are a very talented band- a lot of good riffs and drum licks/fills. Not bad, but again, nothing quite new."
5,Awesome!!! Must own!!,"I discovered these guys on MySpace and what little I heard there, I knew I had to own the disc... Reminds me of Crimson Glory, great pals of mine... But if you dig early Queensryche, CG, Edguy, that great progressive metal that's as powerful as it is intelligent, this band will not disappoint..."
2,Not nearly as good as Celestial Entrance,"Enigmatic: Calling starts out strong, but quickly loses steam after the first four or five tracks. You can literally feel the inspiration drop out of the music. The creative guitar rifts and heart-lifting melodies of the first five tracks are nowhere to be found in the rest of the album. Celestial Entrance was strong and inspired throughout, but you won't find that in Enigmatic: Calling. I think Pagan's Mind has lost some of their focus. If you want to choose one album from this band, go with Celestial Entrance. It is absolutely phenomenal."
1,this puts the word ELECTRO to shame!!!!,THIS IS NOT ELECTRO!!!! go listin to a little group called Jackal & Hyde and find out what electro music really is!!!!
1,Extremely Disappointed,"This product explicitely said that it is compatible with XP on the front cover, however it is not. I have not been able to use it even after software support suggested that I change the compatibility on my system. I can't even get it to install the product, just a demo. I had my son-in-law who is a software developer try to get it to run and he had the same problems. I am very frustrated."
4,Hexabits - Fun,"These are a really neat product. My son hates lego blocks, but loves the hexabits. You can build all sorts of things. I think they are a little hard to manipulate, but he doesn't seem to have any problem"
3,Wonderful Botanical Paintings,Botanical paintings of historical and scientific value are printed in this book. I recommend it to people who have an interest in a botanical art.
1,be warned ! avant garde to the point of absurdity !,"a cocaine sniffing prince orlofsky . a director who decided to rewrite the operetta putting in new dialogue. dark ,sadistic,amateurish. i knew i was in trouble when i started reading the booklet inside the dvd box. i wish they had put that information on the outside of the box. get the royal opera at covent garden dvd production with placido domingo conducting. one last comment . the costumes were out of some brechtian three penny opera,mother courage german expressionist nightmare."
1,Scabrous,"Disgusting, a disgrace, an antithesis to what the Fledermaus, and for that matter, any operetta stands for..ZERO stars for me.."
5,Spring into Fun video,"Kids really enjoy this video alot! I bought it for daycare children and it has a variety of characters they are familiar with, much better than some of the stuff on television these days!"
4,An easy to use step by step guide,"This is an easy to follow guide with simple instructions that get good results. The many diagrams and photographs certainly help when you're a novice in the darkroom, or serve as a useful reminder if you've been away from the darkroom for some years as I had. The book is printed sideways so can be taken in the darkroom and referred to as needed, and pages turned as you work through the various processes. My only criticism is that it should have been spiral bound, making it easier to open flat on the table while working from it, but overall a very useful book."
4,"Excellent, Step-by-Step for Beginning B&W Darkroom Work","Dennis Curtin's book is an easy-to-understand, step-by-step procedures handbook for the beginner in B&W darkroom work. It covers setting up a darkroom, developing B&W film using standard Kodak chemistry, and making prints and enlargements. Easy to read, easy to go back to as a reference. It does not cover color work in any way."
4,Nice book but a little outdated...,I picked this book up as I recently got into shooting 35mm and have never developed my own film. Great reference book.. the content is a little outdated. however it answered some questions I had about the film developing process.. this book only covers black and white film developing. Still a nice book to have.
4,Tasty World Seasoned Smooth Jazz,"This is a great listen when you are in the mood for mellow smooth jazz. There is enough world spice thrown in to make it more fun with Caribbean, Latin, and some African flavorings bringing this world gumbo to a simmer.I would have went 5 stars but for track #2, Cherubim Seraphim. This just didn't fit with the rest of the cd. It isn't a bad song, it just leans too heavy toward a more classically trained voice that seems out of place with the general dirrection of the vibe of the rest of the cd. Thats my gut feeling on it anyway.Todd Beals horn work is warm and soothing and the percussive work of Orlando Sanchez and Glen Barclay is in the pocket. Shaun Fishers keyboard work is spot on.A good cd to add to your collection, only one track that doesn't sit well with me, (and who am I but just another boogerhead in life), so buy it and add some global flavor to your smooth jazz."
1,Horrible TV stand,"This stand did not support my TV (50lbs) after claiming it could hold TV's up to 75lbs. The stand broke the second I mounted my TV. I ended up having to ship it back to the seller in pieces at my own expense. An expensive lesson learned, but now I know not to buy things from ANTonline or things made by Techcrap.If your TV weighs over 10lbs, I recommend buying a higher quality stand than this piece of junk. Your TV is too valuable not to use a stand you can actually trust."
1,I'm disappointed and annoyed.,"I was hoping to use this book as one of several references for a college report. I need representatives of the many views held on this issue. Although the scientific explanations in the beginning are clear and helpful, the opinions expressed in the latter part of the book are not useful, as the author indulges in sarcastic asides, illogical juxtapositioning and even a snide nickname or two rather than the dispassionate reasoning I am seeking. The author's dislikes are far too evident. At least he IS evenhanded in criticising conservatives, religions, branches of government, congressmen, public figures, and the common man alike. Amusing, even clever perhaps, but not scholarly enough despite the format."
2,This book does not deserve as much credit as it is given.,"Gregory Pence is an excellent writer. I do not agree with what he has to stay, but he states his position pretty well, although he is somewhat inconsistent in his arguments. He also mocks the Catholic Church and is too egotistical in his own views. He does not understand why the majority of the world is anti-cloning - thinking that we all just fear it for illogical reasons. He doesn't consider that maybe we all oppose it because it is immoral and against what most of our religions stand for!"
3,Suggest showing a revolver in the holster instead of a pistol,"I have not tried the item, but it is always confusing when the description is for a revolver and the graphic is obviously for a pistol and the holster is obviously for a pistol in its design and shape. I would rather have no graphic than a wrong one."
4,Great videos of a good metal label!,"This review is true for both recollection 1 and 2, both of which I own.I have been following relapse records band's since neurosis signed with them in the mid 90's. This label has consistently been a bridgeway for many great bands such as Neurosis, Mastadon, Today is The Day, Dillinger Escape Plan, and Brutal Truth amongst a few. Other bands like Amorphis and ATP are on here as well. These dvd's have a lot of material circa 1995-96 era including two videos by Neurosis on each (worth the low price in and of itself to me). Many of the videos are live performance, or very cheesy home made type (parents basement, family farm), but that's what makes them entertaining. Production value is minimal, because these bands just want to get their music out and heard. Around 60 minutes in lenght, worth a look. I am happy relapse put recollection 1 and 2 out, and hope that they may dig through their vaults some more and release futher videos."
2,Confusing Interface,All the reviews indicated that this software was easy to use. I found the opposite. Maybe I'll get used to Pyro but I doubt it.I should have bought something else.
1,WASTE OF MONEY,"Roxio Easy CD creater is a much better value, unless you want waste half a day recording music."
2,Nice features but so slooooooow it's useless,"I got Pyro 2003 to try to make converting LPs to MP3 a little simpler. I thought rather than use one tool to capture audio, another to convert to MP3, and yet another to clean up LP noise, Pyro seemed a good choice. PC mag write up sealed the deal. Although it does all that is advertised, the software is so god-awful slow in saving any file - even without changing file format - that I have reverted to multiple software packages. And no, I can't blame my hardware, 1.5 gz P4.Pryo does offer a nice way to clean up audio noise. It lets you listen to just the noise being removed isolated from all other sound. This really helps when the control labels and graphs are meaningless. Again, saving the results of any cleanup are so slow that I'd rather live with the noise until a better solution comes along.My copy of Pyro 2003 will be destined for e-bay."
2,Honeymoon Over,"The first week I had this I was pretty impressed. However, the second week I started getting run-error messages and the program wouldn't open anymore. The support site they give for this problem seems to be non-existent (at least Google can't find it) and tech support is pretty lame: there is none on weekends.That's when I have time to use it.Who wants to wait two to three days to get response to an e-mail or to use a program I paid good money for? I have a program that won't run and no help to get it going. A waste of money, so far, and I'm pretty angry!"
2,Boobytraps for the well armed,"This is a DoD publication that assumes you have access to military munitions. If you don't have access to C-4, RDX, Claymores, satchel charges and the like, it will be hard to make full use of this book. If you don't have mil-grade explosives, study some chemestry and buy a book like ""Improvised Munitions"".That said, it gives ideas on how to make use of various situations, e.g in buildings, roads, forests, etc. to slow and demoralize an enemy."
3,Fair treatment,This book seems to concentrate more on the use of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) rather than the classic non-explosive traps. I had hoped more for the non-IED coverage but it is still an interesting collection with plenty of pictures to help illustrate the devices described.
5,Great CD's,My kids love this CD! Even I had fun playing with it Great graphics and lots of fun activities
3,Crayola Masterpiece,"Delivered promptly. Have had a few problems loading the program with error messages stating that their is a problems with our Windows NT operating system (but I use XP?!) When the program works, our kindergartener loves it."
2,poor image quality,poor image quality. I wanted to watch the critters that come on my side yard at night. But if I looked thru the window I just got reflections back. If I looked thru the screen I just saw the screen. Otherwise the image was not crisp.
2,the point of night vision,When I first ordered this item I was hoping it would help me see in very dark environments. When I finally got it and tried it out I realized in order to see in night vision you have to already have some type of light source in order for these night vision mono's to pick anything up. In very dark conditions you still can not see anything out of these mono's. That defeats the purpose of having this item. I should of bought a flashlight I would of been able to see better and it would of been cheaper.
2,Returned night vision,Bought this hoping quality would be there but difficult to make out objects in very low light conditions. Able to see when moon lite but get deep into the woods and could not get a clear view. Returned them for a refund and will look at more exspensive ones to see if quality is better.
2,not great,"i tried this and did not like it. not much magnification and very little night vision. slightly blurry and hard to see anything. also, the one eye trick is not one i have mastered. i returned these and got a pair of night vision binoculars. very happy now. yes, three times the price, but i actually can use these."
3,okay,great packaging quality. not alot of pigment. i think i need to keep testing it out to see if i really like it though.
4,"New spin on the ""face"" of Nazi Germany.",Macdonald delivers and easy read and titillating details on a subject that could have been redundant and boring.As a research source on the subject of SS Obergruppenfurer Heydich it is a must have.
5,A breath of fresh air!!!,"This was the best Inspirational novel I've read in a very long time. To the point, emotionally gut wrenching but not too heavy, realistic and never dull, this book told it like it is. As a man who has gone through this type of situation, I have to say, the author hit the nail on the head. She captures the man's perspective, as well as the woman's and I don't think I've ever seen a writer do that before, especially with such an incindiary topic. I'm not ashamed to say I filched this book off my wife's dresser and read it twice. Buy it, read it, recommend it to every Christian you know, you won't regret it."
1,xThe author's discussion on the osage tribe was inaccurate.,"The book was typical of the exploitation that was experienced by the Osages in the early 20's. The author's treatment of the history of the Osage in Osage county was highly inaccurate; especially his simulated dialogue. As a member of the osage tribe I can assure the reader that this dialogue would have never occured. The author's use of stereotypical language in describing comments attributed to the Osage leaders and in describing the lifestyles of the Osages is offensive, e.g. Baconrind bellowed, the feast raged, osage squaws. The author makes unsubstantiated statements and does not cite sources. Given the author's background I had hoped for an accurate account of the Osage Indian murders, yet it was another inaccurate account by an uninformed non-Indian writing about Indians."
5,Best guidebook I've ever read.,"Heck, it's the ONLY guidebook I've ever read from cover to cover. I go to Vegas a lot and thought I knew the place, but there are sooo many places and things about Vegas I didn't know of that this guidebook describes. And the book is hysterically funny. I just kept on reading it. It's addictive. Sometimes I pick it up and read parts of it for a second or third time. The book is full of good information and it's a total crack up. It's a really good thing to read on a plane on your way to Vegas. You land with a new appreciation for the place and in a really good mood."
4,a very good guide,"I've always preferred Lonely Planet guides when I travel. I wasn't disappointed with the new LP Las Vegas guide. It gives you pretty much all the information you need for a good vacation in Vegas. Best of all, it's a nice portable size. I was able to keep it in my purse the whole time and whip it out at a moment's notice. Despite the good coverage of information in this guide, it doesn't go as in depth as the Frommer's guide, which is probably a better guide for planning your vacation before you leave, while the LP guide is good for traveling around the city."
2,In sore need of an update...,"This outdated book could really use a good editing by somebody who knows something about the american breeds. There are some low quality horses being presented as breed standard. In particular, the Saddlebred presented is a very low quality horse compared to the WB type horses presented. That horse would only be moderately successful at the lowest levels of the breed ring."
4,"Great pictures, not much detail","This is a must have picture-book of horse breeds, but it will need to be supplemented by other books for adequate information on choosing, caring for and breeding your horse."
1,Biased and Poorly Researched,"Many of the American breeds are poorly researched and given negative comments that are not true. The saddle seat riding discipline is not hardly even mentioned. Despite the pretty pictures, I would not recommend this book."
1,Empty,"Can not, for the life of me, understand the four/five star rating. The book is simply a whole lot of absolutely NOTHING! What a theft of precious reading time. Should be arrested."
3,"Good, but not my favorite book","I listened to the audio version of this book. The story had me wondering what would happen next, and I found myself interested in the characters. But I felt that the use of the F word was forced and did not add any value to the story. If the author was trying to create some sort of anticipation about why the character ""B"" was not called by his full name, it did not work for me. The narrator's voice reminded me of ""Diane"" on ""Cheers"" which may explain why I thought the main character was too snooty. She said the word ""internet"" like it was something extravagant that you probably would not be familiar with. It was a reasonably good book, but not one that I plan to listen to again."
4,Gordon's New Work Well Worth The Time And Money Spent,"A long time fan of Mary Gordon, I went to a local bookstore reading and left hungering for more. Gordon pulls you in with vivid descriptions, a candid, sometimes raw narrative, and an in-depth look into a relationship that couples of all ages can relate to. Her writing remains as crisp and tasty as before, but is a bit more sexually provocative in this refreshing take of woman as artist, man as muse."
3,"Amusing, but basically vapid",The characters and plot showcase the natural evolution which occurs when narcissistic baby-boomers loose their hair and go on Provera.
2,Better by far to re-read old Gordon or new anything else,"Gordon, when she's good, is very very good. She's not so good in SPENDING. Oh, she's intelligent and sometimes funny, but her protagonist spends so much time promoting her own interests and defending herself, hardly anything happens. The saving grace is very good talk about painting. Of course Gordon tells everyone in interviews that she's being ""punished"" for not writing the same ole same ole Catholic girl story. Nonsense. She's being criticized because SPENDING is boring."
2,A non Mary Gordon effort,"A self indulgent, cliche of a book. An irritating protagonist. Superficial outlook on life, and human relationships. Did Mary's traumatic father discovery put her into a temporary trance? Show-offy in the art area. Vulgar in the sex area. Parent-child interactions so tiresome. ""B"" , the pivotal male figure, a commodities trader. PLEASE!!!Will the Mary Gordon I have loved please come home?"
1,The author is as confused as the main charcter in the book,"A very poorly written book. This book is the next best thing to a sleeping pill. She is too wordy and all over the place. Lacks depth, as well as the art of story telling. She touches on different topics without any depth. Please dont waste your money and time on this book."
3,This book is a page turner that turns on the eyes.,"I was completely enraptured and pulled intothis book.Spending deserves high praise. What I loved most were Gordon's pictorial descriptions. She made me alert to and savor: Sky, weather, food, flowers, sea, the male body, female bodies, paintings,Old Masters. It is a rare achievement to be so visual on the page."
4,Entertaining with surprising depth,"I bought this book as ""trash"" reading (listening). It was very entertaining, but also made me think. I recommend it highly."
1,Never judge a book by its cover,"I was intrigued enough by the inside cover and recent reviews to buy her book, but found it painful to read; the writing style is crudely simple and terribly contrived (not in the least bit witty). The story line follows the stereotypic recipe of artist as starving, self-indulgent martyr. As a writer/artist herself, Mary Gordon should know better. The issues the main character faces are so old and crusty one can practically smell the mold between pages. ""middle-aged old-school feminist struggles to retain relevant contemporary hipster status""one word: yuck. (to put it simply)"
5,Like cool nectar on a warm day,"Certainly, the back cover draws you in with the suggestion of sex and money and perhaps a little moral corruption. Gordon has a fascinating way of blending some of the best works of art (albeit some unappreciated) into the story without beating you over the head with them. Additionally, she has the ability, reminscent of Pat Conroy, where you can actually see, smell, taste, and touch everything she describes. A great book to take on a trip."
2,The Notorious Lord,"This book is about two childhood friends who discover they have feelings for each other after about 17 years. Cory is an archeologist and adventure seeker who wants to travel the world. Rachael is tired of travel (her parents are both archeologists) and she now wants to settle in one place and build roots. This is a sweet romance about friends falling in love,but is a little slow moving. Over all it was worth reading. It is also the first in a series,so several loose ends were left un addressed for the next books to pick up."
3,Not as pictured,"The pink frosting looks more like cardboard painted with a thin layer of pink paint. The cherries are not as pictured. They are made of tiny beads [check the image I uploaded]. That makes the whole thing look fake. If they used the fake cherries like what are in the picture, it would've been better. The only realistic part is the white frosting around the edges. I added a picture to show what it truly looks like. I am not returning because it at least looks slightly real. From a distance, it'll work. If you are looking to buy a fake cake, go for the more expensive ones."
3,"Great mini-series, but DVD quality - not so great!","Purchased this used DVD set but disappointed with the condition of DVDs. They were scratched up and had smudges all over them. Nevertheless, the 13 episode mini-series was awesome."
4,Needed More Seasons Over Here,"After reading some of the other reviews I too have to say that although this was a good effort....Only having this season is like only having the first book in an on going series. It's good, but in the end you're left wondering what's next? And there is no next......At least into the personal on going stories.Having said that though I still think this first season is worth having. The episodes are interesting, (Although I do agree with those who said the home stories needed more time to develope) emtertaining, and they also give those of us who never have or likely will never be ""Over There"" a fairly good idea of what the situation is actually like for the men and women who are.......That's really the strength of the storyline in this series, and why it's worth buying......"
5,What idiot decided to do only one season?,"I am an Australian ex seviceman. Somalia, Iraqu, Afghanistan and a lot of other S--t holes in the world. I have just finished watching 'Over There' and it was brilliant. It is crying out for another season. The end leaves you wondering what could have been? I liked the theme music, the effects and the acting was first class. I take my hat off to all who participated and produced it. Bring on some more."
5,The best war series,"It is too bad that FX has decided to cancel the show. It was probably canceled due to political pressure.It really dealt more with individual characters in a war setting. In fact, it made me appeciate the actual efforts of the troops on the ground versus the nay sayers stateside and the grandstanding congressmen and senators that simply criticize the war effort without having a concrete plan in place to actually do what is needed.In the tradition of Combat, Tour of Duty, China Beach, Over There was a high quality series with excellent acting and sets. I really wish that FX will rethink about producing the 2nd season."
5,Outstanding Series,"This is a powerful show with an outstanding young cast. Their stories are believable and it's unfortunate that we won't get to see what happens to them due to the show's cancellation. It's by far one of the better dramas that have come out recently.As for the DVD itself, there are only a few special features: a couple of episodes with optional commentary and a documentary. The documentary, however, is very interesting and provides an in-depth look behind the scenes. Even if you've seen all the episodes,the DOCUMENTARY ALONE makes the DVD worth buying."
3,"""Over There""?",For those of us who have been 'over there' this is an interesting look at what everybody else that hasn't thinks it's like. Some issues are accurate yet some are rediculously stupid. Although it is obviously an artistic interpretation it is a good show to watch for a good laugh and some deep thinking.
5,Great TV Series,"I had watched all the episodes on FX when it did come on. I just had to watch them again, so I bought the DVD set. I wish there would have been another season of the show."
5,great series,I've heard from many people that this is as close to what is actually happening over there. having cancelled this series was a mistake.
5,Must see!,"Great , a must see for all Vets in the Iraqi War. There are some great scenes that brings back some memories. Although we all realize these scenes are far fetch. Soldiers are a lot more disciplined than shown on the series, but I can relate to SSG Scream."
5,Great series,"I hate it when great shows like this get cancelled, FX really dropped the ball with this one.This was well written and acted, this series showed us a realistic depiction of life in the early parts of the war."
3,great drama but reality far from it,While this show can be enjoyed as a drama if you are looking for something that is realistic ignore this one. The same few guys/gals take on way too many bad guys with only a Sgt. The hated and never there Lt. seems to always be in the rear. The intro to the characters is done is such a way that these guys are deployed together and just now meeting each other. The story also makes just about every military spouse out to be a drunk or cheater. I know that real life is never that exciting but this is a little too unrealistic.
1,Defeatist Propaganda,"The series is well filmed but BE WARNED, this is defeatist propaganda. Every soldier is either a racist, gets cheated by his wife, loses a limb, enlisted to avoid jail or kills a 8 year old (That's right) or hates the press. By wacthing these series you are saying that our troops fighting in Iraq are criminals, and you are only giving their enemies more reasons to fight. They are volunteers and are there because YOU don't want to. Show a little bit more respect for them."
2,The creators of this show should be ashamed.,"I really did not like ""Over There."" I rented this film with one purpose in mind: I wanted to have an accurate portrayal (or the semblance of a portrayal) of what life is like in the deserts of Baghdad. I wanted to know what the troops were going through. Instead, this television show is distinctively anti-war and and anti-American. The soldiers are portrayed as punks, low-lives, idiots, prostitutes, lesbians, unintelligent dopes, victims, killers, torturers--and more. This is not justice to the soldiers in Iraq. Instead of seeing characters with integrity and patriotism with the likes of Jack Bauer from 24, we are provided with characters who are shallow, depraved, and who spout out insults for no apparent reason. Any person who has spoken to someone in the military knows that the soldiers are intelligent, well-spoken, and thoughtful people. The creators of this show should be ashamed."
2,z-z-z-z-z-z-z,"This show is just ok. The theme song is really lame and really annoying. Mrs. B is hot and fun to watch (a female driver on the show). But it just gets kind of predictable quickly. We get all of the expected scenarios here... an amputee who wants to return to the army, a woman cheating on her husband while he is risking his life in Iraq, ied's going off every so often... but it's like they spent so much time trying to give a realistic portrayal of the war that they forgot that in order to keep the audience into the show that they needed to deliver great stories and great writing. This might be worth renting but is not worth buying unless you are a veteran of the war or have family who is and they were not maimed or killed."
1,Not Happy,"I am from Australia and i ordered this DVD, and i should of been told that we could not play it over here, as it was present for christmas i feel extremely embarrassed for that. Also it didn;t arrive on time it was about 4 days late, what a christmas. i have returned them back, just waiting on refund and i feel i should get a refund for postage too."
1,It might be a good looking watch but not working!,I have returned the product. The arms of the watch was not working.
1,Thermometer Does Not Work,This thermometer does not work. It comes in 1 full degree lower than the actual temperature (F) (measured with another digital BD thermometer). Nine seconds is obviously not long enough to get an accurate reading. Got it because it didn't beep continuously but it still has 3 long beeps to notify you when it is complete - and then the number is totally off. Do not buy.
1,Inaccurate & Slow Thermometer,This BD Rapid Digital Thermometer is very inaccurate (3 degrees F)and does not measure a temperature in 8 seconds as advertized. I threw it away because it caused undue concern when I first used it.
1,Not enough info for safety,"I have a real problem with this brand. They do not disclose adequate information to allow you, or your vet, to determine if there products are safe and effective. Until they do, I would avoid them like the plague. There are plenty of competing products on Amazon who are forthright with their information, and I would only consider them until this situation is corrected. If you do not know how much, or how little, of each substance you are giving your pet, you are playing Russian Roulette with their lives and their health."
3,Basic information,"Yorkshire Terriers for Dummies is a very basic book. Most of the information contained in this book can be found on the internet. There is specific Yorkie info for people who are willing to search the internet, save and or print it out. This basic book is for those who want to have basic information in their hands when needed."
5,Yorkies,It's a very good book and it made me realize that I don't want a Yorkshire Terrier. Too small!
2,very dirty,"bought a used book on yorkies, it was stated in good condition. so soiled that i am afraid to touch it. might order a new one."
2,yorkies for dummies,When I ordered this book it said that it was new. And when I got it the corners on the front and back had been creased and smoothed over again. I am not very happy.
3,Good info with a snob point of view,"This book got a lot of great reviews and I tend to like the ""Dummies"" books. It did follow the traditional format the Dummy books are known for and it was informative and helpful. However, the lack of two stars are for what seemed to be the lean towards AKC snobbery. Come on, a pet Yorkie should never be bred because she isn't show quality? We are getting our Yorkie because we want her to be loved and a member of our family; but this book seemed to written for those who have an allegiance to the AKC and only own Yorkies for strutting in shows. By the way, there are other organizations to register a Yorkie with than the AKC!!May I recommend the Animal Planet Yorkshire Terriers book instead?."
1,Not Pleased,I was hoping for info regarding basic puppy training of my yorkie. This book provided me very little info that was actually useful. I wish I could return it and get my $ back!
4,Fantastic,This book is great. I bought it after already having Logan. I wish I would have bought it before hand. Lots of great info and they are pretty much bang on for everything they say. Please buy this book before buying your Yorkie... it does make life easier.
3,OK but not great,Lots of info that is fairly generic. i was a little dissapointed but If this had been my first puppy then I would have found more of the book interesting I suppose.
5,The Central Doctrine of 'Emptiness',"In essence, The 'Large Sutra on Perfect Wisdom in 25,000 Lines' reveals the central doctrine of Mahayana. There is no dispute that this is among the most important texts of Buddhism.And besides, not only Professor Conze was one of the greatest contemporary Buddhist scholars, he was also a practising Buddhist."
4,Excelentes faros!!,"Excelentes faros, alumbran bastante! Solo mejoraría el aspecto de seguridad, ya que con solo aflojar dos rueditas con la mano te lo puedes llevar."
4,Great light!,I have three of these providing me with near daylight in the darkest of nights. Set up is extremely easy (assuming you have some ability to do 12V electrical work) and adjustment is very straight forward. They are the best bang for the buck around!
3,Great rusty fishbowls!,"ProsImpact resistantVery bright, returned from a trail once with only one of these working (others were flooded) and could see everything on the road.No vibrations watsoeverConsVery Heavy.Not water proof.Rusted in one year."
2,"Bamboo cutlery tray (organizer) - good idea, poor planning","Love bamboo! Sounded great but the tray does not have adequate or properly sized sections for typical flatware sets. No place for soup spoons (back section too short), salad forks or longer handled ice-tea spoons. Plastic organizers have all of these - but they're plastic! Need a good bamboo flatware organizer."
1,watch those measurements,"My drawer is 17.5 exactly, and this thing is actually 1/16"" longer then said. Phooey! Missed fitting by a breath. Darn."
5,Great quality & very contemporary,"It fits perfectly in my kitchen drawer..holds all my cutlery, and also has enough slots to hold all my knives, ice-cream scoop, pastry brush and measuring spoons.bamboo looks very contemporary too! and it matches the inside of the kitchen drawer perfectly!"
4,So far so good,Unlike this productLipper International Bamboo Expandable 23-Inch Drawer Organizerthe sides have not become unglued yet. Still holding up. So far so good.
5,Still Going After All These Years,"I bought this about three years ago and it still looks great. Sturdy and has enough compartments to house my everyday use utensils. I wash it out occasionally and, to give it a great new look, use tung oil to restore the rich look of the bamboo."
1,If I wasnt so busy I would return it,"it beautiful,nice color, seems sturdy, but put it in the drawer put silverware in it and with in 3 days three of the dividers are unglued and shifting around. I should return it but who has time to mess with stupid things like this?"
1,Avoid this one,This thing fell apart in about two months. I had to superglue it back together again. Not recommended. Find a different organizer.
2,TooBig,"I purchased this bamboo deep flatware organizer as a gift, but it turned out to be too large. I forgot to return it within the 30 day period,so I decided to keep it, hoping it would fit a drawer in my new apartment. I'm happy to say that it does fit one drawer. But, after a few months of being in the box, this organizer fell apart at the seams. The manufacturer must have used a very cheap glue and not a single staple or nail to hold the structure together. I will try to glue it together and hope it holds. Otherwise it is a very nice looking item."
5,This starter is the best,So nice to just put in a few fatwood sticks rather than using an oil-impregnated sawdust bar to start the fire.
5,"At last, a concordance for C.S. Lewis' works","As an indivual who likes to read and quote C.S. Lewis, I have often thought about tackling the task that Janine Goffar has accomplished with this volume. Organized alphabecially, like a concordance, usually with a brief quote on the topic at hand, the reader is referred to one or more works by Lewis where the subject is covered in more detail. This volume would be a welcome addition to the collection of any serious reader (or quoter) of the theological works of Lewis, who introduced many to the concept of ""mere Christianity."""
3,Claudia searches for her real family.,"Thirteen-year-old Claudia Kishi suspects she was adopted when, while looking through picture albums, she finds no baby pictures of herself -- and while looking for more albums, a large locked box that she is sure contains her adoption papers. Claudia searches the magazines and newspapers in search of her real parents."
2,"Claudia Kishi, adopted?","This book was very unrealistic. Just because Claud isn't exactly like her family, and not some genius like Janine, that is no reason to find out if she is adopted! That's plain dumb. Plus, this is Baby-Sitters Club we're talking about here. Though I am a huge fan, I know that the books almost always have a happy ending. Claudia, adopted? Yeah, right!"
4,good intro to surrealism for kids,"My 10 yo daughter read this without comment- her interest in the book probably stemmed from a deep love of babies. There is a bit of time spent with the babies and some more thoughtful discussions among them that one would normally expect. :-P The talking babies add a nice touch of surrealism, as does the re-knowing that Obee and Mungedeech go through as pre-teens.Even without the touch of surrealism, the subject of being your own best friend and really knowing yourself is an important one for people this age. They are starting to have the urge to follow their peers and not be true to themselves- any book that effectively contradicts that message is good to get into their hands."
1,"uh, are people that dumb?","I must say that this book is pretty horrible. Written with ""speculative style,"" one has to wonder if Pepper actually has any cold hard facts. The book is full of ""this must be, so that must be"" fallacies. I recommend Case Closed, by Gerald Posner, which already disproves half of what Pepper is getting at."
2,Culligan undercounter water filter system,"Installation and filtering functions work great. My problem is that the chrome decorator finish piece tat covers the end of the faucet was missing. Instead of including that piece, someone had taped a hearing aid battery to the unit. Not usre if they thought that was a fair trade or what."
1,If looks could kill,"Here we go again. Gamo had the perfect chance to make the ultimate affordable pistol, and blew it. The accuracy of the 2 R-77's I owned were awsome. The great power and awsome feel of this gun made it a winner at first . After about a week it vommited C02 cartrage after cartrage. ""No! not my new revolver!"" I thought to myself , so I sent it in and got a new one. Same story after 2 weeks. I wish it wasnt so , but its a paperweight in Combat clothing. I almost thought about keeping it because it was such a great looking gun, but if this happend twice in a row.... Well , I guess its back to the store for my gun and back to the drawing board for GAMO. - Read my other reviews"
5,This is crazy,Didn't know you could review a light...You put it together..wire it andturn it on...There is nothing to like or dislike..by the way it works fine..
3,Worth how much?,I will say that you get a little less than you pay for with these earrings. They look like a pair of walmart bargain bin earrings.... not worth the 38.00 with shipping that I paid. I am still going to use them as a gift only because I dont have time to replace them.
2,Beware purchasers!,"This is the edition which was heavily edited and dumbed down by W.O. Simpson, editor.The true original edition is the 1810 version which was republished in 1999 by Asain Educational Services, New Delhi/Madras, India. This version contains all of the pertinent information to which Kersey Graves and others had refered to which was later edited out by Simpson in his effort to suppress this information, thereby making making others who had referenced the original seem foolish.It's best to have both copies so you can see for yourself the appauling edits. But I warn buyers from buying the edited, non-original verision for more than about $100."
4,Acervo Especial - Maria Bethania,"I picked this CD up in Brasil in 2001 when I was increasing my Brazilian music selection. For me the best song is the last song, not because the CD is finally over, but just because I think she saved the best for last. It is the most beautiful song on the entire CD. I also have the same song on a different CD so I've posted my copy of this CD for sale here on Amazon. My copy is actually labeled ""Acervo Especial"" not ""Brazil's Best"" but the cover art looks the same and all the songs are the same."
3,An uplifting story easily read in a couple of hours.,"This is my first experience with Janette Oke's books, and it certainly won't be my last! I had heard a lot of wonderful things about the author and was very excited about reading this book. It didn't disappoint. Beautiful in its simplicity, this moving story is full of pioneer culture and Native American folklore. The characters are well-presented and the attention to detail makes the setting and adventures come alive to the reader.When Kendra is exposed to influences outside of her secluded world, she becomes a Christian. At this point, the story becomes quite heavy-handed in its preachiness. This is the reason I deducted rating points - I don't buy into the concept that it is the mission of all Christians to impose their beliefs on others. I prefer stories that deliver the Christian message more subtly."
3,Romance for 4-8 year olds???,Janette Oke is a wonderful author and this is a well written series. The reading level is for ages 4-8. My concern is whether it is wise to introduce romance to girls at such a young age? I don't think so and hence my lower rating.There are plenty other excellent historical fiction series and clsssics for that do not contain romance that I would rather see my daughter reading.
3,Not a clearly written book; Somewhat outdated,"This book spends a large part discussing fusion splicing and little on current fiberoptic components. Some of the devices (such as filters and switches) discussed are constructed of bare fibers instead of collimators which is the current industrial practice. But, since there is no better book on passive fiberoptic components today, this book deserves a space on the bookshelves of fiberoptic professionals by default."
2,PussinBooks,I knew about this film. I was really hoping for more film of the cats. Instead it was interviews of people. Disappointing. Not sure why this was so talked about. The idea of library and bookstore cats should make a good film.
4,It works,I'm not sure what more to say than this product just works. It's not blazing fast but I didn't expect that from this card. I have several devices that have 2gb size limits and this card works perfectly in them.
1,Can't Store Files. Keep Having Errors.,"I have purchased Kingston cards for years and enjoyed their quality. Recently got this card (blue sticker instead of brown) and my camera keeps saying ""can't recognize file format"". So I put it into the card reader and see what happens. Individual photos show valid file size but when you click the photo file, there is nothing to see. I have reformat this card many times using WinXP utility as well as my own camera.I started reading reviews from amazon & new egg and found I am not the only one with error files. Someone commented that this problem is due to made in china or taiwan. I don't think it's a valid statement. I have SD cards made in china, taiwan, japan and no problems until I use this 50X Elite Pro."
4,So far so good,I am using this in my Casio Exilim 6.0 MP camera.I had taken a lot of videos (1 hour duration).So far there is no issues and there is no delay in storing the image onto the SD card.
1,Kingston 2 GB SD Memory Card,This SD would not work in my Nikon Coolpix S6 camera (but the Fuji and Sandisk product did)
1,2GB Elite Pro SecureDigital Card,"Ordered this card to store MP3 files. It would not let copy files total size little more then 1GB, it would error out ""I/O error"". Both quick and regular format did not help, tried 3 times. Requested replacement, and 2nd card practically had same issue. After copying about a gig of files, it would error out ""connection lost"". Also tried it couple of times. I formatted card and noticed after formatting it shows only 950mb free on empty card?!"
5,Excellent purchase so far,"I got this with discount, and it arrived in less than a week with free shipping. I recommend this to anyone. I record video and it is good so far."
5,Best Bang for the Buck.,"This card gives us over 1,000 pictures or over an hour of digital video using our Kodak camera. Definately a good price."
2,Quality sucks and service responsive,"Purchased one last year and another one one month ago, both cards died at the time within a couple of days about two weeks ago. While taking a picture, the cards took a long time to respond, then showed read error from camera, lost all pictures taken. Call Kingston, they are willing to replace the sd cards."
5,Great product,"I bought this memory card for my camera sd500. At first, I was very dispointed when I only see 1gb on my laptop. After googled around, I realized I need to update my laptop sd reader driver to recognized sd card that is over 1gb. I'm able to see full 2gb after driver update. Just make sure you update your device/laptop firmware/driver first."
1,Bad experience with this SD card,"Please do not buy this product. It worked well for just a few weeks (3 or so) and then right in the middle of our Las Vegas trip when I had almost 1GB of pictures taken on that day, with 1 more GB to go it just died. It gave a memory card error and my camera was unable to read or write into it. I plugged it into my computer and the computer failed to get any data out of it too. I bought a new SD card and my camera worked just fine. So I lost all the memories of our trip in just a second. I got an RMA from Kingston where they replace the broken card but you are responsible for shipping it to and from them. The total shipping cost would be approximately 10$. I am not sure whether its worth it because you might get another card that might die again on you when other brands are available for just $20..."
5,Fast and cheap,"Even in the age of SDHC, there is a place for 2GB memory cards. I've found that it provides a de facto organization tool for my pictures. Sometimes it's easier to find that one picture if you have three smaller cards than gigantic one.In any case, this card is great. I've consistently had download speeds in excess of 9MB/sec. And at $22 (jan 2008), it's a good deal, too."
5,Great High Speed Card for Camaras,It is a great high speed card to purchase if you are inserting into a digital camara.
4,Brave Heart.,"I enjoyed reading this book (as I do when an author delivers food for thought)Not a book to read if you are wrapped up in religion.....would offend for the next couple of centuries. BUT for the open minded it's a good read presenting another view of historical religion. (and there is nothing wrong in that) Might raise an eyebrow or two or make the hair curl, which is what a good read does to the avid reader. A one to purchase if you admire a book written by a lady with a brave heart."
1,"Mmm... Nice, Refreshing Crack...","At least that's what I felt like the author was on at times during reading this. I enjoy reading alternative views of Mary Magdalene and seeing where people got their ideas, but this book started strange and got further and further beyond the realm of reality with every chapter. No matter what you're looking for in a book about Mary, I wouldn't start here."
4,Good Start,"The author has obviously spent several years researching this subject alone and with her co-author of other books. I like her approach in putting forth theories and letting the reader decide. In the forward a bit of anger toward the Christian Church was revealed. This was a much needed work to tie up some loose ends from her and her co-authors other books as well as those written by Baigent, Leigh and Lincoln. I do find it fascinating that Picknett and Pagels seem to read the same research with far different conclusions.I would suspect that the author will have more to say in a future book as this has just touched the surface. Certainly more needs to be revealed of the secrets held from the common layperson. Excellent bibliography!"
5,Mary Magdalene Myth and Metaphor,"I haven't read this particular book. My quest for information was completely sated by the book, Mary Magdalane, Myth and Metaphor by Susan Haskins. You'll love it."
2,Why isn't this silver?,"I got this item as a gift for Christmas, and I was kind of disappointed. It's a nice watch, except for the fact that instead of being a bright silver color in the picture, it was this strange-cheap-steel-sorta-yellowed color."
2,Watch,This watch is cheap. The clasp aways unlatches itself. I've also had issues with moisture on inside of the face.
5,Great value in an entry-level scope,"This is one of those 'great bang for the buck' scopes. Nice clear glass, nice large turrets that have solid clicks and can be reset to zero. I have it on top of a Remington 700 SPS Tactical .308 and it has retained zero and works perfectly. Bushnell released the mil/mil version right after I bought this one and I wish I had that one now, but no complaints about this as it was a good deal for the price and it has worked very well for me."
4,Good value in a fixed power scope,One of the only affordable ten power scopes available. Optic clarity good. Eye relief good.The cross hair adjustments seem to stick up and out much more than necessary and are not easy to accomodate on the rifle in a hard case.
4,good order got on time and satisfied,"would do business with them again. everything was just like they stated nice item, Something I needed for a projest I was working on"
3,Hard to find in the stores,"It works, but just barely. The threaded part needs to be at least another thread longer. I tried it in 3 different faucets and they all fit the same, just barely."
5,Great!!,"The songs on this album are fantastic. ""Don't Know Why"" and ""Ultraviolet are some of my favorite McFly songs and they are off of this album. It is great!"
4,Retro Pop Rock,"McFly is a retro Pop Rock band. Anyone had done actually, the rescue in the mix between Beatles and Beach BoysMaybe if you love McFly you will love BBMak:www.bbmak.tk"
2,Example of an unecessary upgrade,"I was a happy SS6 user and looked forward to version 7. What a disappointment. Not only does the start up optimizer not even open, but easy update is now a misnomer. I installed the software on two separate machines - which are new (XP Media) and I'm having the same problems on both machines. Oh, and because I upgraded from System Suite 6, I thought that the program would intuitively migrate important settings - but it didn't."
1,"Horrible, Horrible software","V-COM has totally destroyed what used to be a decent product. First off loading the software caused both of my computer systems to no longer boot. Then you cannot remove the software. I had to end up using Windows Install Clean Up utility to remove the application. I had used System Suite since version 4, and now I have to look for a different system since V-COM has obvioulsy hired blind monkey's with hammers to do their program development.Please let me apologize to any blind monkey's as comparing you to this software is truly unfair to you."
4,Latest patch 7.0.4.3 seems to fix problems.,"I have been using this software since version 4 and have been very happy with it. I updated to version 7 and like everyone else had problems with the firewall starting correctly.This now seems to be fixed and the software is working fine on both my computers, and doing a good job.You get 3 licences with this version which is good.I have only given 4 stars as it was cheeky of them to release software that didn't work properly in the first place, and put everyone through the pain of trying to make it work.I rate this above other brands as it just works nicely without continually hassling you while you work."
1,Not Ready For Prime Time,"I have been using SystemSuite since version 4. Cannot complain until now. I am having the same problems as another reviewer. NetDefense Firewall loads only half the time and my computer has been ""jerky"" since the install. Customer support, although responsive, assures me a upcoming update will fix these issues. We will see. I suggest waiting a few months before purchasing."
1,Another winner goes downhill,"Conan has my sentiments exactly. This was a great product for me for 3 years. When I splurged and bought multiple licenses for several home computers, nothing worked properly. Each and every time, the tech support (on Mars or Venus) gave me detailed solutions involving changing my registry manually. At first I tried and when that didn't work and they gave me more homework to do, I realized I was dealing with a defective program and an unprofessional cop-out of a company. Getting my money back was impossible so I decided to ""take the hit"" and never deal with them again."
4,System Suite 7,"I am a fan of the System Suite pc security products. I have used them for several years, and find them very well constructed and easy to use. I had used another security service in the past, but they didn't supply me with the protection for my pc that this product gives me. I highly recommend it."
2,It shouldn't be this hard to get software to work!,"I bought this product mainly for the utility tools, not the av or firewall, so I haven't bothered to install those. However, I can't even get the clean up tools to work. You click the button and the program shuts down instead of doing anything!E-mail tech support has been relatively quick to respond, but the 'fixes' they've suggested haven't helped at all. Frankly, I'm thinking of returning the darn thing."
4,Good maintenance tool,Does practically everthyhing. A little more refinement would enable me to rate it 5 stars.
4,Purpose and Power in Retirement,"I found Koenig's view of retirement challenging and worth reading. I am writing a chapter on retirement for a book I am working on right now. His notion of our needing,in our final stage of life, a worthy purpose involving the serving of others is consistent with my own thoughts. Too many retired persons literally waste many years in self-centered boredom."
2,"Restating Earlier Books and Falling into the ""culture trap""","Koenig has certainly made great contributions to the field of spirituality and aging. That makes this book even more disappointing. He does warn the reader that he is of the judeao-Christian tradition and in this publication makes some token statements about cultural and religious diversity. Even these are disappointing because they seem disparate in subject and give the appearance of bing hastily added. I also believe that he falls into the trap of ""prescribing"" what ""successful retirement' looks like. I also thought his identification of the philanthropist, who funds his publisher, as the most generous person he knows a bit too muchHis ""Spirituality in Patient Care"" is alot better. For a good read on culture trap ty ""Learning to be Old: Gender, Culture, and Aging"" by Margaret Cruikshank. It is harsh but reallly makes you think."
4,what a fun game!,"This game is great, its a good version of Clue for kids, I am 15 years old and I still enjoy playing it with my friends because its really fun, I think that if you have the game Clue at your house and your little brothers and sisters wont play it because its to hard for them I think they should get Clue Jr."
4,a good family game,"We play this game as a family. It's a fun spin on an old game. The only problem we have, is the pieces fall over easily. Love this game. Would recommend it to anyone who has kids that like to play games."
2,Not Pleased,My 3 and 5 year old daughters say this game is boring. They will play for about 15 minutes and beg to play a different game.
3,"Fun for kids, but not for their parents","I bought this when my older daughter was 4, and she immediately loved it. At age 8, she still enjoys playing it with her 4 year old sister. No reading skills are needed, so IMO the age ranges can be lowered.HOWEVER: the adults in the house got really, REALLY bored with the game. Our children weren't able to play it without an adult also taking part in the game until the older one was perhaps 7, so if you want to buy games that you won't mind playing, you may want to give this one a pass.We have a slightly older version, where clues were hid beneath cardboard cutouts of trees and mailboxes and such; these eventually lost their stiffness."
3,Fun but too Overcrowded,"We just played this game with our 5-year-old daughter. Though we had fun it was impossible to keep the pieces in the right place. The individual character pieces as well as the furniture pieces are all very large. Since the goal of the came is accomplished by occupying the same tiny space as another player or piece of furniture, ultimately the pieces get jumbled. It becomes very difficult to see where you are and how to get where you want to go. Only 2 elements to guess makes the game easy enough for a five-year-old. Cute pictures make it fun. Process of elimination is a worthwhile learning concept but only goes so far. We probably won't play this game too often though because of the hassle."
3,This game is for younger kids!!,"Clue Jr. is just like clue but it is easier. There are only 4 people,5 or 6 places, and pets. You have to find out, who stole the pet, what pet, and where did he/she put the pet. This game is great for my sister. (She is nine.) She hates clue because it is too hard and too long. She loves this game. If someone thinks clue is too hard or too long, buy this game for them."
4,good for young kids,"As a Clue professional from my childhood, this game is nothing like the ""original."" It shouldn't be as it is tailored for kids, so in that regard, it is fine. I found the directions and play of the game confusing, but after a few games with my kids we all got the hang of it."
2,harder than regular clue,My 6 year old daughter liked to play regular clue with me so I got this one because you can play it with 2 people instead of 3 like the original clue. It is very hard to ge the hang of the set up. We play a lot of games but for some reason my daughter could not remember the correct way to check things off on her score sheet. I don't think this is easier for kids than the original and I would not recommend it. The concept is good but it is too complicated.
4,Not quite what we expected!,"Clue was a favorite of mine. I explained to my soon to turn 5 year old son that it was about catching a bad guy and he wanted it. We got the Jr. version of course and when it turned out it was about catching the guy who ate the cookie, he was a little disappointed, as was I. He did end up enjoying it but it took a lot of energizing on my end. He likes solving mysteries, etc. He is in K-4 so he was ready to play. I just wish, considering this is for 5 and up, that the theme was not quite so toddlerish! Boys want action and this is just too ""cute"". We will play it because I am good at getting him involved and I want him to play Clue with the family later but I understand now why it was so hard to find."
3,A gift for someone,I loved the Clue game when I was growing up so when I saw this I knew this would be great for my family member. It's cute.
5,A beloved favorite,"We bought this game for our daughter when she was five. It was a great introduction to the concept of the process of elimination, and she loved playing it. At age 8 she's now ready for the adult version of Clue, but we haven't given away the junior one yet-- still too attached to it!"
2,UMMMMMMMMMM.........................,"OK when my dad bought this game for me I was excitied. Then my friend came over and TRIED to play it but how do you know if they ate the cake or not?! All they give you is, Miss Scarlett,Mr.Plum etc, some pieces of paper with different drinks and all that,futiture (I dont know why they gave me this)and a game board. So how are we supposed to find out? I have played adult clue. But they give you cards and a file. If someone know how to play Clue Jr please tell me!!!!!!!!!"
2,Stupid and boring,"This is one of the worst kid's games I've seen. Why, oh why, would you hide important information on the bottom of game pieces, and then make those pieces COMPLETELY TIPPY, and design the board so that the pieces are accidentally TIPPED OVER all the time? What a waste of time and money!"
4,Fun Game! A little hard for my 5 yr old though...,"I love this new edition of Clue Jr. It actually looks like Clue now. My 5 year old is a little slow with the strategy, but she might do better playing against kids her own age instead of her older sister and her parents. :)Easy to set up, no shuffling of cards, you put each of the characters on a ""stand"" that has a different time on the bottom of it and put different things in the room (like a plant or a pool table) on a stand that has a beverage on the bottom of it. The extra time and beverage stands go in the middle and you try to figure out what they are.No one has a character so you can move anyone around the rooms making it more equal for everyone. And you don't hold any cards in your hands so its easier for the kids to keep track of. Still comes with clue sheets that have places to mark off what you find out."
3,not as good as I thought,I bought this game for my child and it initally was more complicated to play this game than the origanl clue. Once we got the jist of this game we found the board was to small and complicated . Its an ok game but we all can play the adult version of clue with much more fun!
2,Clue Sr.?,"The original verion of this game is far easier to follow for the youngsters than the ""JR."" edition. If the kids don't get freaked out by the game concept of solving a murder (any parent allowing their 5 year olds to experience the age appropriate games delivered by Playstation 2 can get over this concept), the original CLUE works far times better. The confusion of the setup and play of CLUE JR will remind uninitiated parents of how user friendly the standard edition is. In turn, they will find the ease of playing and explaining said version is to the wee ones. A fine idea, to get a younger crowd to enjoy an old favorite board game, but poor execution make it a pointless venture when the original game was already perfect for the whole family."
4,My 3 kids love it,"I don't know why this has so many bad reviews. My kids (7, 5, and 3 1/2) love this game. My husband and I don't mind playing with them either. (I'd rather play this than many other kids' games) I don't know that I'd break it out to play with a group of adults, but that's not who the game is intended for. My kids can set it up and play it by themselves, and if it keeps them from sitting in front of the TV....that makes it great in my book!"
4,It was a good summary of Cobain's life: not to involved,"This book is a good read if what you are looking for is a quick look over of Cobain's life. I used it while researrching a school project, and I found that it was quite useful for telling the basic facts."
1,ok odd,"im a big nirvana fan,but im only 13 so basically i fit into that age group.i havent read the book,and i dont want to.why would anyone make a book for people this young about kurt cobain?"
4,Tight fit for LX5,"So, I bought this for my Panasonic DMC-LX5. It fits, very snug. The big lens on the camera makes the front pocket very tight. I can squeeze the extra battery in, and probably an SD Card, and that's it. I could fit something in the main pocket with the camera, in the dead space next to the lens, but I don't want stuff rattling around with the camera. It has a reasonable amount of padding, nothing too strong, good structure, it's well made. I don't know what the flap is for either, honestly.This is a good case for the LX5 if all you want to take with you is the camera. But I realized all too late that when I do that, it generally goes in a pocket. I want a bigger case now, to carry the lens adapter and the Gorillapod and the other knick-knacks that go along with this thing. My bad. When I do, I'll try to find this case a good home, because it's a quality piece."
5,Lowepro 50 Camera Bag,"Just the right size for the Canon S100 and accessories, including spare battery and flash cards. It also holds a mini tripod that I love."
2,Zipper gets stuck,Perhaps it's defective but the zipper was hard to open/close. This bag may be all weather with its bells and whistles but it slows me down for taking pictures due to its zipper. I sent it back and I'm still looking for a decent bag for my LX-7.
4,Great camera bag.,Very sturdy camera bag that is the perfect size for a bigger point and shoot. The velcro belt strap makes it easy for a handsfree experience.
5,Great case for Nikon AW100,"Bought this for my Nikon AW100. Fits perfectly and has room for extra memory cards, batteries, etc. Also has a nice strap on the back to attach it to a belt or backpack or whatever. Great case!"
4,"Nice case, but did not fit P7100","I purchased this case after reading another review that stated it fit the P7100. When I attempted to put the camera in this case I realized it was not going to fit. I even removed the camera strap and swivels from the eyelets, but the camera was still too large to fit without using a lot of pressure, which I did not want to do to my new $400 camera.I returned this case and purchased the Tamrac 5689, which worked perfectly for the P7100."
3,They need to re-think this design,"I bought this bag for my Panasonic TZ1 and it fits the camera well, seems well padded, and the accessory compartment is just the right size for a spare battery and memory card.What I don't like is the thick flap over the top, it attaches in front of the zipper for the main camera compartment so it offers no protection for it, and the smaller compartment is also zippered so I see no function to the flap other than to add to the bulk of the case. The seam for the zipper inside the main compartment is real thick and bulky and gets in the way of zipping the zipper, I feel like I am going to break the zipper by pulling hard enough to zip it.I like the material it is made of, but I think there are better designs out there, and will be returning this one."
4,Excellent fit for the Lumix LX3,"This is a very comfortably sized and shaped back for the Panasonic Lumix LX3, which has a fairly protrusive lens. Not too tight, not too snug, and fairly well padded. The belt loop, though removable, is very secure and seems like it would be nearly impossible for casual pickpockets to overcome.The secondary pouch, while somewhat gratuitous, offers a safe place to store a spare battery and memory cards, the battery charger, or maybe a small USB cable. Overall, a very well thought-out, well-designed, and reasonably priced accessory."
4,Bought it for the belt loop,"I originally had a CaseLogic case for the camera, but the belt loop broke after about a month. Reviews said this one has the best belt loop in the business, and it's hard to argue with that. It's not showing the slightest hint of wear so far, and it gets plenty of abuse. I'm less fond of the zipper which is difficult to operate. Not terrible, but I'd be happier if I could get at the camera a little more quickly. Overall, an excellent case."
3,Too small for Samsung HMX-R10,"Although that Lowe website list this bag as one that fits Samsung's HMX-R10, it's too small and you have to use power to shove it in and close the zip"
5,Excellent case for Canon G9,"Very well designed with the nice option in the back of putting your belt inside the hook area or VELCRO open/shut the area in the back.. so if you don't want to look weird in the middle of the street and appear as if you're undressing.. This provides that option.Stretchable weather resistant material. Separate compartment for battery/memory cards.The Canon G9 fits comfortably inside like it was tailor fit for it. All the other G9 cases appear HUGE. This case is still in the compact range.Good reliable company that makes them with lifetime warranty.Reasonably priced. I couldn't get myself to pay $30 for a camera case.What's not to like? I agree with other reviewers about the flap.. however, this flap doesn't cover the main compartment that houses the camera.. so you won't use it all the time.. just when you need a battery/memory card change and it's not that often.Highly recommended."
3,"Durable, but Odd Design","This case is remarkably roomy for it's size. It comfortably fits my 16x zoom compact in the main compartment. The auxiliary compartment comfortably holds a spare battery and and memory card - with room to spare for a couple of other small items. It's rugged and durable, too.But the design leaves me scratching my head. There is a velcro flap which would be useful for keeping rain out of the main compartment. But the flap only covers the zippered auxiliary compartment. The camera compartment - which is the more logical choice for the extra protection - is protected only by the zipper.It's a nice little bag, but a small change would make it much nicer."
2,LP needs to redesign their bags' closures,"This is an OK bag, but like many of Lowepro's bags/packs, the zippers are awkward and stiff to use. Bought it for a new Lumix LX-5, which fits very well. But the main compartment sits back toward the belt clip (which is nicely designed), so you have to struggle a bit to unzip and extract the camera. I may return it and go with a case logic or some case that's easier to get in and out of. This has plenty of padding, so much that it adds a lot of bulk. I like protecting my camera, but this is a compact point and shoot, so making it bulky defeats the purpose. Too many of LPs products seem to be better for storage of the camera equipment rather than using it."
3,Lowepro Rezo 50 Camera Bag,"I bought this bag for my LX7 camera. I found it to be SMALL. Had to send it back!Thanks, Randy H"
4,"IDEAL CAMERA BAG FOR A KODAK Z1275, Z1285, OR Z1485","I HAVE LOOKED AT AND TRIED OUT MANY DIFFERENT CAMERA BAGS FROM VARIOUS MANUFACTURERS. THE LOWEPRO REZO 50 CAMERA BAG IS THE ONLY ONE I'VE FOUND THAT SEEMS TO BE JUST THE CORRECT SIZE FOR MY 12 MEGAPIXEL 5X OPTICAL ZOOM KODAK Z1285 CAMERA WITH THE POP-UP SUNSHADE I ADDED FOR THE LCD SCREEN AND ALSO NORMAL ACCESSORIES (SPARE BATTERIES, EXTRA MEMORY CARDS, AND THE MINI USB TO STANDARD USB TRANSFER CABLE). I TRIED IT OUT AT A LOCAL STORE BEFORE ORDERING IT FROM AMAZON.COM (AMAZON.COM WAS CHEAPER). THIS BAG ALSO HAS THE BEST CAMERA BAG BELT CLIP THAT I'VE EVER SEEN, AND AN OPTIONAL-USE SHOULDER STRAP IS INCLUDED. I WOULD GIVE THE REZO 50 FIVE STARS BUT I'M NOT SURE HOW DURABLE IT WILL BE."
2,No at all good,"I bought this bag looking at the display on amazon. But compare to price I paid this bag is not atall good. Size is small, extra pockets are useless, where you cant keep much. Camera pocket is also not convenient.Only plus point is quality of material used."
2,Is there a limit to how many quotes a book can have?,"I don't know if anyone has counted the number of quotes in this book, but there has to be at least one super-enlightened inspirational tidbit every three sentences. In keeping with this, here is a quote from an average reader who has not found his life's mission ""if you can't clearly formulate any of your own ideas, you shouldn't write a book"""
5,Destiny Compass,Extremely well written and thought through. The book helps you prepare for the emotional minefield we all face when determining our own outlook towards choices available in different professional careers. I would read this book before undertaking any start of a career or a change in professional direction.
2,OK - but just,"I bought this book to prepare for the ASQ CQE exam. This was my primary reference book and I did pass the exam - so there must be some merit to this book. However, it is frustrating. My criticisms include:- the index doesn't point to the right pages, making it very difficult to use (especially in an open book exam)- some of the graphs have no labelling at all (Fig IV.28)- some material is repeated (eg central limit theorem)This book has some good stuff in it and is aimed at getting you through the CQE exam. It will also be useful for a practicing quality engineer. However, it is in many cases separate articles, procedures and discussions stuck together with little flow. A good review and editing would do a lot for this book."
1,Too much work,Color did not match car interior and was different than photo. Stitching the wheel would take a very long time.
1,Great unless you need more than Two Keys !,"I tried to get two extra keys made for this lock at the Local Ace Hardware, and then at two different professional Locksmiths. Unfortunately, none of them could find a key blank that would fit the lock. From what the Lock Smiths told me, apparently the overseas companies to get past copyright laws, make their keys just a little different. This makes it impossible to have extra keys made for this lock. If you only need two keys, then this one will work. If you need more then two keys, skip it."
2,Wrong item,"They sent the wrong item. But when I notified them of the error, they quickly corrected it with the right charger."
3,"2nd one, We will see","I ordered and within 2=3 weeks, it just stopped working. I sent an e-mail, recieved a quick response and a replacement has been sent. Hopefully it goes well."
3,Not for north american models,"The book is fine for genral repairs. But, do not buy it unless you have a non-fuel injected model. It does not cover anything fuel inhjected. The engine diagram is completely different than my '87 Stanza GXE sedan.I think this was written for european models only.I'm going to buy chiltons book now."
4,Great for beginners...,I bought the manual so I could do small jobs on my car. I sold the car a while back but recently re-sold the manual for a small profit. Great pictorials & explanations. I recommend buying used to save some money.
2,Al Jarreau,I have CD's that are realy master pieces of the astist. Al Jarreau has several real master songs that could replace the ones in this CD.
5,So happy to see this film at last,"This film is a challenge to find because for some inexplicable reason it is still not available on DVD. But that is the beauty of Amazon is the ability to locate these hard-to-find (VHS) gems. I thoroughly enjoyed watching this film and I am so happy to own ""Isadora"" at last."
2,video,the video was only okay in that it had lines throughout the playing and at one stage the distortion was interfering with the playback.
5,Nice liner,This liner is true black. It does not flake off. The pen allows for precise lines. Love this liner.
1,Not impressed,"I have used Lancome eye liner many times before. What I didn't know was, not every Lancome eyeliner is made equal. If I had known the quality of this one, I wouldn't have bought it.... It sits on my dressing table collecting dust..."
5,love!!,"This liner has been in my morning routine for 10 years. I love all the colors they come with. It is the best liner on the market, and I have tried most brands."
4,17th Karmapa's Return to Tsurphu,"""The 17th Karmapa's Return to Tsurphu"" gives a rare and unique perspective on the fascinating subject of the Karmapa: his birth, parents, initiation ceremonies, etc. Although not meeting the highest technical standards, this video of the 17th Karmapa's early years and formal return to Tsurphu Monestary will only grow more valuable with time, especially in view of the fact that the 17th Karmapa has fled Tsurphu Monestary for India. Many, if not all the important contemporary Kagyu lamas/teachers appear in the video, including interviews/statements by the Sharmapa and his main teacher Tai Situ Rinpoche."
1,"Great Sound, Poor Quality","I have tried 6 different FM transmitters for my iPod. The TransDock was the one that gave the best sound. However, I have had to return the two because they broke, literally broke into two pieces ripping the wires out of the product. The first time I thought I was asking too much of the articulated arm, the second time I did not use the articulated arm and the product still broke - that day. Very disappointing. Of the products I have tried the one I have been using is a $19.00 little bitty thing from iSound (If you live in an Urban area you might not like the iSound product due to the limited frequencies)."
1,Waste of money and time,"I've always used Griffin Technology's Road Trip to play my iPod in my car but it still has some static, very little, but some. So, I tried to upgraded it by buying this DLO's radio transmitter that seemed better, specially because of its large size antenna. Well, it turned out that DLO's has much, much more static than Road Trip. In L.A., where I tried it, it was extremely uncomfortable to listen to the iPod through it! I had to forget about it and turn my radio on! Many times it doesn't play anything at all!!! I'm returning this to Amazon and going back to Road Trip which is the best radio transmitter for iPod available so far."
1,TransDock,"I recommend you spend more money and buy the older version, the TransPod. This one does not emit good sound and has a lot of static."
5,Very fine scope!!!,I've purchased two of these scopes for my rifles - both are excellent scopes. The magnification helps when you're reaching out to 200 to 300 yards. The 50mm objective lens makes it so that the exit pupil stays large enough when on the higher powers. The resolution is also fine enough to see .17 caliber holes at 100 yards.This scope represents an excellent value.
5,Best Bang for your Buck,"Mounted this scope on a Savage 10pc .308. Very Clear optics. Clicks are dead on for adjustment. I'm getting under .5"" groups consistantly with this setup. No distortion at full zoom. Clicks are audible and crisp. Don't hesitate on purchasing this scope you will not be sorry. I like this scope better than my Nikon Prostaff by far."
4,Perfectly fine,"I mainly bought this one because it was available in mp3 form, and it was not by an enormous ensemble like the Berlin Philharmonic. (Actually I don't even know that, since the name does not convey very much, and I downloaded the file, so that I don't have much documentation at all!) As far as I can tell, there are no more than four violins, which is in line with best practice as far as I know it.They seem to observe all the repeats, at least in the first movement. It is played tastefully and accurately. It is recorded in rather a dry acoustic, which suits my purpose."
4,Not Free SF Reader,"Moles abound.The last book in this trilogy is probably not quite as good as the other two, you could call it a 3.75 if you like, but there is some entertaining commentary on what goes on in the spook office with the whole clueless management versus the footslogging hardworking spy in the field.MI6 is still a bit worried about Benard because of his traitorous spouse, so when he finds out about what he thinks is yet another mole, he isn't looked on too favourably, particularly as it might just be one of the higher-ups.People who like the others should still enjoy this."
4,Great practical book for Sunday School and one-on-one wchild,This book is easy to read and has a lot of practical information for instilling Christian values in today's adolescent. Applicable to the late 90's teen. Great for use in a study-group setting or as Sunday School consideration for 5th or 6th graders.
5,BUY THIS BOOK!!!,"If you have kids and care at all about what challenges may come to them in the teen years, you need this book! It is THE most helpful book I have read on child-rearing. It really opens your eyes to what is out there, what your children need, and what you need to do. Thank God for this book! And thank you Dennis and Barbara!"
5,Preparing for adolescence,"Best book that I've read regarding parenting teens. Chapters are not too long, the topics are relevant to teen behavior and there is good guidance for parents."
1,Ingredients and Cancer,i like the taste but it contains Carrageenan which is linked to cancer tumor growth. Trader Joes and whole foods have an Almond milk that does not contain Carrageenan so why take the chance.here is a link to one of the many websites that explain.[....]If you have time it is easy to make almond milk which had tumor inhibiting factors (only if you soak the almonds) .
2,"this is not a ""ky kit""","The bullet is not a product of KY. It was not packaged in the box. Actually it is not packaged under any name at all, it is a cheap item that did not work at all. I was able to get a full refund from the company."
2,Worked for 1 day,"I bought 2 of these, one was bad out of the box. Got em from J&R (very good service) they replaced it quick. Once I got a working pair, I had a 8-12mbps connection from my 1st floor to the basement for one day. Then I could not get the connection to come back. Called the mfg, they said this is normal in many old houses, especially with whole house surge protection, like mine. Oh well, maybe this will work in other situations, but it was useless for me."
2,Look for another brand if you want a product that can last longer than 4 month,"this product works OK when it works. very easy to setup, the speed is decent. I ordered 3 of this to setup my home network. (wifi is not an option for me since i get headache whenever I use wireless devices).I was happy for just about 4 months, and 1 of the 3 drops dead.so if you want something that has a little lasting power, look for another brand. time for me to try out Zyxel's warranty service...Update: Zyxel replaced the defect unit promptly. Good service."
5,My First Romance,"I found this book years ago at a used book store, and bought it because of the picture on the cover. I had no idea what it was going to be about, but the picture was so beautiful that I bought it anyway. This was the very first historical romance I had ever owned and it sparked an interest in historical romances that has lasted over 15 years. This book made me laugh and cry, but I could not put it down! The character's were far from perfect, which only made the story more interesting. I highly recommend this book to any true historical romance reader.I wish there was more information about Mary's books. I have all of her ""Roses"" series, and even they were extremely diffult to come by, but I would like to know more about some of her other work..."
5,Best Hand Lotion Ever,I do love this lotion. I first received it in the hospital and brought it home. When I started to use it regularly I discovered it was very soothing. It is the best for winter use. Really soaks in and is not greasy. Pleasant smell.
4,Another encouraging Barney book,"This is clearly designed to give kids comfort with the doctor, and it does a good job. The photography is colorful and sharp. The story is in line with the pictures. However, the book opens with noting that Baby Bop is afraid. If your kids haven't developed a fear of the doctor's office, seeing Baby Bop afraid may give them the idea there's something to be feared there. This book does clearly show there's nothing to fear about the doctor though, similar to the Barney Goes to the Dentist book."
5,Matchbox Platinum Collection,I have been trying to buy this artist on cd for years and after finally doing so I am extremely happy with the cd and the service I received from amazon.com It was easy to purchase the products and my cd's arrived in excellent condition and within a short time of ordering. Very happy.
4,Good scope and great warranty coverage,"For the money, this scope has great features in the 1.25-4 scope class. It has good optical clarity and the red dot is a neat feature.The red dot filament detached from the reticle on my first unit. Bushnell replaced the scope under their Elite line warranty and the second unit has been good so far."
1,Kindle customers beware!,"Amazon has linked this book to the page for Penguin's edition of The Decameron translated by G.H. McWilliam. After careful shopping for the ""right translation,"" I ended up purchasing McWilliams'. And the more I read it the happier I am with my choice. When I saw that the book was also available for my Kindle I impulsively downloaded it. WARNING: This is NOT the McWilliam's translation (it seems to be a very old, public domain text); nor does it include McWilliams' excellent and conprehensive introduction.My advice to Kindle customers: When buying classic literature in translation for downloading, always order a free sample first so you be sure it's the translation you want."
5,Just what I needed !,"Very nice wax warmer. U can switch the types of waxes out. I use it often and simply go to a beauty store when I need any more wax strips or wax sticks, etc."
1,Don't buy it,"I was quite excited about this product when I read the reviews. However, when I got it and opened the wax, it got stuck all over my fingers. There were no instructions in regards to handling the wax or how to clean it. I was able to get rid of most using a baby oil however I felt stickiness on my fingers for the next couple of days. I decided not to use it and return, but the company refuses to take it back."
4,Great!,"The product is great, with one exception...as other posts said, the directions are not the best. But once you figure out exactly what you're doing with the equipment, it's fantastic, and a great deal. It will save you a lot of time and money instead of having to go to salons all the time!"
4,Great way to wax at home.,"This warmer is fabulous. I was using a sugar product before, but wanted to try wax. I attempted to use the Poetic wax kit, but it took forever to warm up on the stove top and cooled down to quickly. This is the perfect solution. I used this on my bikini line, with the Gigi wax and it worked great. Not painless, but the results are effective."
2,Caution - missing important info in the description,"Although the quality is very good, the item description does not include what the hole spacing is. This is obviously important and something I should have inquired about before purchasing. The hole spacing for this storm door latch set is 3"" and the spacing on my door is 1 3/4"". Since I opened the item it cannot be returned."
2,"OK, but not great","I got the Lowepro Rezo Camera Case for a Canon G9, which fits in the case nicely. Not real snug but the camera strap on the G9 helps to keep the camera well seated. There is not a lot of extra room for accessories with the Rezo, barely fitting an extra battery and spare SD card. My biggest complaint with this case is the flap that fits over the accessory compartment. This is basically non-functional, having no real purpose other than to cover the accessory compartment. It would have been nice if the flap had a zipper pouch or something to hold more accessories. I am planning on cutting it off entirely."
2,great quality but not functional,Looks nice great quality but main camera compartment too large for small camera too small for regular sized camera. I have a Lumix LX5 and it has enough room for 2. The front compartment for accessories is way too small. Front flap has no purpose.
3,Not for Canon SX130 IS,"I was looking for a case for my Canon SX130 IS. Using dimensions, I decided to try a ""Lowepro Rezo 60"". The camera fit was okay, but the closing zippers were impossible to close because the back side inner lining blocked the top of the case. This could have been corrected by additional sewing to pin it down but I didn't try. Also when the the front zippered storage section was opened and pulled down to access contents, the integral pocket opening pointed down allowing its contents to spill out. Finally the strap connections were on the very top rear of the case which I found not as convenient as those mounted lower down on the sides of the case. Continuing to look, I found that a ""Tamrack 5292 T92"", to me, had a much better fit and function. Don't get trapped when using camera dimensions to select a case. Sometimes only the outside dimensions are given..."
4,"An OK camera case, but not for the Canon G10 or G11","I was looking for a case for my new Canon G11 (high end non-SLR camera). It is definitely large enough to hold the camera, but I wanted space to hold a spare battery, the charger, a SD card reader, and a couple of extra SD cards in a zippered ""can't lose it"" compartment.This case doesn't fit that bill. There is no way to get the charger in along with the camera. And the main compartment is much too large for just the camera, increasing the chances that the camera will get scratched as it bounces around inside.So I'm returning it, and still looking for the perfect camera case for my G11."
5,Perfect for my NEX 6,"For me, the concept of this camera(NEX6) is a small powerful package. This case follows perfectly with that idea. It is like a holster with a very strong belt loop that is attached with velcrow and a metal snap(very secure and safe). The size is minimum- no real room for anything else-camera body with a flat lens. There may be room in the front pocket for an extra battery, but it will be a stretch. There is a strap included but I will not use it. High quality item and again- exactly what I need."
2,Too bulky,Bought this case for my Lumix LX5. This is too bulky to fit in my purse.There is an ample space when you put your camera in.
4,Good Tool for Awkward Jobs,"I found it necessary to saw off a rivet inside a 3/4"" diameter tube. Rummaging through my rather well stocked toolbench for an appropriate tool--the best I could come up with was triangular file. About 90 minutes later, I finally succeeded in extracting the rivet. Since I had to repeat the process on another rivet (and tube), I went looking for an alternative. This little handy saw did the trick. The second rivet was extricated in a few minutes. The tooth spacing for the saw was a little coarse for the job--I would have preferred much finer teeth--but the job was done in short order and I was quite pleased."
5,Excellent Scripture-Based Book,"If you are looking for a scripturally based book on causes of and help for snobbish treatment within churches, read this. Val Lee does a great job in covering this subject using the Bible as her foundation, and in the process offers comfort and confidence to those who have been hurt by this phenomenon. She effectively shows that this destructive behavior arises from the lack of understanding and application of God's Inerrant Word, and that those who look to Christ in faith can live triumphantly victorious lives that are beacons of light to others who are struggling. I really enjoyed this book, and hope that many others will be blessed by it."
3,Good Food,"The recipes are great for an introduction to Asian cooking. The rest of the ""diet"" was not so interesting or motivating."
4,Clean humor,"Good clean humor. These two were such a good team. Refreshing . I wish more shows were like these. No, I am not a senior citizen I just enjoy clean shows."
2,George Burns and Gracy Allen,I mistakenly bought this. This is too old of program. I thought for some reason I was getting the old radio shows.
4,good clear scope,The scope brings in lots of light in the evening. The firefly glows nicely but makes the cross hairs larger than than normal. Overall I would buy another one for my next gun. Might go with the 3-9x40 for clearance issues. The 50mm front makes mounting on short rings almost impossible. Another thing the firefly glows brightly at first but dulls out quickly so at first it may be to bright then become dim to quickly for some peoples eyes at night.
4,"Excellent Self Defense learning DVD lessons for kids with bullies, and woman for abuse and rape defense.","Very good techniques, and easy to learn instructions.I started watching and practicing these simple and effective techniques with my 12 year old son and 10 year old daughter, and they not only picked up the self defense moves very easily, but the enjoyed learning it. ( I think they just liked ""submitting their old man."" I found most of the move effective even against an unsuspecting adult man. Very good. Next my wife and daughter are going to study and learn the ""Live to Tell"" woman's defense next, and the Tae bo set for great exercise."
1,Great movie RUINED by absurd dubbing!,"The Emigrants (and its sequal The New Land) and truly great films, and Liv Ullmann and Max von Sydow contribute two of their best performances ever. HOWEVER, what lame-brain decided to release this in VHS in an English-dubbed version ONLY. If any movie requires its native language, it's this one. A huge part of the movie's strength is created by the sense of how ""foreign"" these new arrivals were in the U.S. The movie literally makes no sense when the family finally makes it to the U.S. and the ""Americans"" don't understand them--even though in the ridiculously dubbed version they are all speaking English! It's also a travesty that they didn't use Liv Ullmann to dub her own voice (if they HAD to dub it)--and we all know she speaks English quite well. If you have the choice, get the laser disc version. At least it is in Swedish and subtitled. Let's hope the DVD version will not repeate the mistake of the videotape!"
3,A Criminal Mishandling,"Jan Troell's The Emigrants was released in the U.S. with 40 minutes cut out of it, so it has never really been seen in the States, thanks to Warner Brothers, who were too stupid to grasp the film's significance or, indeed, audiences' abilities to enjoy this 3-hour+ masterpiece. To make matters worse, the only version available is an execrable dubbed version. Even if Von Sydow and Ullmann were there to post-dub their own voices, it is an affront to this magnificent film, and to anyone with brains and taste enough to enjoy it unaldulterated by studio sabotage."
1,Find the real movie by searching for UTVANDRARNA.,This dubbed version leaves a lot to be desired.Find (and get) the real version right here on Amazon.Search for keyword UTVANDRARNA.
5,Good case for a trail runner / hiker Lumix TZ5,"I will be the first to admit that I am tough on equipment. I do a lot of trail running and can be rough on gear. I am on my second Rezo 30. The zippers pulled apart on the first one. I wish outdoor equipment manufacturers would invent zippers that worked better in the field.Having said that I already destroyed one I will also say this is the best case of its type on the market. The way the clip both velcros and snaps on is perfect. The design is smart, and the size is perfect. I take my camera with me on long distance trail runs and hikes - it works well with myUltimate Direction Access Plus (Black).Update 12-13-09Well my second Rezo 30 has had a zipper failure. C'mon! How about using a better quality zipper on these!"
2,Could be great.....,"Ok, so this could be a great case. I bought a new point and shoot and needed a new case. I like all the attributes: the size, the fit, the space for extra SD cards and the velcro/snap loop - but the zipper sucks. Period. I like (and own many!) Lowepro products and thought the first one I got was just flawed - but the second one was the same. So I kept it (for the reasons above!), but every time I open it, it feels like I'm tearing the zipper out......."
4,Lowepro Rezo 30 (Black),"Nice shape and size, fits snug, seems strong and secure with belt loop and neck attachment. Even has a front pocket for storing extra battery. Could have come with a bit more padding inside. The inner tags would likely touch the screen depending on how one stores the camera, so one may wish pull out the inner tags. All in all a good product."
3,Fits great but quality is slipping,"I found this bag to fit my Lumix ZS3 to fit almost perfectly, and still expand a little pocket to carry an extra battery and card. After enjoying Lowepro case quality for my cameras over the years, I was disappointed to have the safety snap break after only 4 or 5 uses. Granted, while this does not make the case unusable, I don't fully trust the velcro alone so will need to jury-rig a fix or buy another case."
4,Likely can't go wrong with this small Lowepro camera bag/pouch,"I had already bought one of these before for another camera at a well-known brick-and-mortar store so I expected it to be fine. The camera (a Panasonic 5X zoom compact digital camera)fit in the bag just fine, with just enough room in the small pockets to keep two extra (AA in this case) batteries and an extra SD card (if I wanted to). It is a tough and durable little case, well-made and fits its purpose just fine. It is recommended, especially at the price available online (if free or low cost shipping). Just check its inner dimensions carefully against those of your camera because having it not fit would really be the only downside in purchasing it."
4,Rezo Camera Case,The Rezo 30 is a great little case. It holds the Panasonic TZ5 perfectly and has enough padding to protect the camera from little bumps.. The front pocket has enough room for a spare battery ..could be a bit more splash resistant.
4,A bit too tight for the Canon G7,"The Lowepro website sizing/compatibility wizard said this bag was a good fit for the Canon G7 (see the 19 FEB 2005 review someone posted here), but I found out personally that the bag is just a tiny bit too small for this camera. You probably will not be able to get the camera in the bag if you keep the strap on the camera. I took the strap off, and it fits, albeit skin tight. Other than that, it's a nice bag, and will fit an extra battery and an extra card or two in the side pocket."
2,Too small for a Lumix ZS-3,"It is too small for a Lumix ZS-3.Sometimes the camera turns on when I am trying to put it inside the case, because it is so tight that I accidentally touch the on/off button. I plan to change it for another case soon, and definetively do not recommend it."
5,Perfect fit for the Lumix ZS8,A good fit and great protection for small digital cameras with extended optical zoom. The double attatchment of the belt loop adds security and still allows for ease of attatchment without removing your belt.Internal side gussets lower the risk of the camera falling out of the case while working the zipper. Has a small but functional extra storage pouch for a battery and a couple of cards.Excellent price and fast delivery.
2,Not good for Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS6,"I bought this case on the basis of all the good reviews, but I was disappointed by the fit for my camera. It would appear to be perfect on first examination, nicely protective and a good, snug fit. However, I found that I needed both hands to CAREFULLY extract and replace the camera in the case and close the zipper. There is a large ridge on the inner seam along the zipper, which interferes with the movement of the zipper. Anyone who takes a lot of pictures and wants easy, spontaneous access to the camera, will be frustrated as was I. The case is nicely designed and very sturdy, however, so I suspect that a larger Rezo would be a better option."
4,Decent camera bag,"We selected this bag for our Lumix DMC-TS3 using the bag selector on the Lowepro website. The bag selector, for the Rezo line, indicates that our camera would fit the Rezo 20 and that the Rezo 30 would provide some extra room. Yeah right. Thankfully, the Rezo 30 was available for much cheaper than the Rezo 20, so we got this one. The camera might have technically fit in the Rezo 20, but it would have been really tight.Other than this bag being a bit smaller than I expected, it's a great bag. The belt loop is very secure. There is a small ""flat"" pocket inside the main pocket, which for this camera works to store the brush they provide for cleaning sand out of the seals. There's plenty of room in the main portion of the pocket itself for a couple batteries for this camera.Overall a really nice bag and worth the money we paid."
3,Beware of the zipper...,"I am on my second Rezo 30. The first one did not have the snap on the loop, but the second one did.Beware of putting batteries in the accessory pocket and facing the LCD towards the batteries. Had my case fall off my belt (older one) and the screen shattered as it fell flat off and there is no real padding in between. Good thing sony actually reapired it for free under warranty.The real problem is the zipper. With the two case I have had, the zipper fails right at the corner at the top. The stitching tears and you cannot close the case. You can't sew it back up, as the teeth are a spiral and there is no real tape like on a regular zipper. Still, I will likely buy another as it is fairly cheap and does a decent job."
4,Good fit for Lumix ZS3 and Canon A480,"I bought this case for my mother's Canon A480, fit is good, a little float but not too much.I have a Lumix ZS3, the ZS3 also fits just fine in this case, not too tight, not too loose. I have the LowePro Ridge 30 case for my ZS3. The Ridge 30 is slightly larger than the Rezo 30. The ZS3 also fits fine in the Ridge 30, a little float but not too much. I think either case is fine for the ZS3. Note that Ridge 30 is too big for Canon A480.I give the case 4 stars instead of 5 because the zipper is a little sticky near the corners, even when empty. The Ridge seems to have a smoother zipper. Not sure if this a difference between the models or just manufacturing variation?"
3,Too small for the Panasonic Lumix TZ5,"This case was recommended as an accessory for the TZ5, but it is much too tight a fit, worse if you actually keep accessories in the accessory pouch. I worry that there is too much pressure being exerted on the lens, even though the padding is generous. I have heard of people having problems with their TZ5 lens retractor/cover being a bit fragile, so it seems a very bad idea to stuff it into a too-snug case.For someone with a more compact camera where the lens retracts flush with the camera body, this would be ideal, as it does seem like it provides a lot of protection."
4,Good camera protection,"Wish it had a tad more room for a spare battery. It can carry a spare sd card with ease, you need to find another way to carry a battery and/or a charger."
3,Quality,"The hooks to the neck-strap is too fragil and easy to undue, causing the lost of the back + camera . . . too sad."
3,Not exciting...,"You know, its a bag. Holds the camera. Works. I find the zipper a little tight.It performs exactly as expected, so I guess I should be giving more stars, but it just isn't exciting enough to get more stars."
4,Mexico&#65533;s no. 1 lady of rock at her best,"This is the follow-up to her 1991 album 'Flor De Papel', and on this one she continues the collaboration with producer Miguel Blasco and uses the same songwriters as on the previous album. More of the same, you might think - well, not quite. The songs are better and more consistent and the sound has improved a lot. Apart from the somewhat dull ballads ('Te Esperaba', a great power rock ballad, is the exception) this album is crammed with good uptempo tunes. It opens with the thumping drums and deep bass of 'Mala Hierba', and other efforts in the same dynamic vein are 'Soy' and 'Ruge El Corazón'. The equally energetic 'Mírala, Míralo' has an instantly catchy keyboard riff on it, and is definitely one of the best tracks on the album. Alejandra Guzmán's dirty, hoarse voice suits these melodramatic songs perfectly."
2,meh,"rubber duck squeak is just air being forced out through a hole at the bottom, nothing at all like a quacking duck or anything. duck also doesn't stay afloat upright well"
3,Rubber Duck Review,"The ducks are cute and they all squeak even the big one. However, the little ducks are top heavy and tend to do a face implant in the water. Still cute though."
1,"Old footage, repeats galore, bad video.","This old video is mostly of tackles from old football games. Many shots are repeated from a different angle. No voice, only music, you don't know what teams (only a few are shown anyway) are playing. Poor quality"
2,Not talk enough,Doesn't add much height. Would have opt for something taller. Son loved the firetruck idea. But he still can't reach the since and he is a talk 2.5 yr old. Storage compartment looks likenot could be an amputation risk so I will have to glue it shut.
5,Great step stool,Very impressed with the quality of the stool and great directions to put together. Would not hesitate to buy another one or another option from this same line of products
3,kidkraft step N,I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY HOME DAYCARE BUT. THE UNDERNEATH Soak WATER AND Wear-out AFTER SEVEN MONTHS.My kids used it and i never used it for the daycare so far.
1,piece o crap,"I dunno, you might like it if you're into the whole consumerism thing. I HIGHLY recommend you take your $30 or $40 to your LOCAL thrift store and score a beautiful wooden step stool. This thing is lame but too expensive to exchange"
5,I used this on my sailboat.,The hinge worked great and the wood screws were included. This is a great replacement for smaller individual hinges that are broken.
4,The Refomer,"This is a biography of the historic Martin Luther from 1493 to the early 1500s. The name Lutheran comes from its founder Martin Luther. After nailing the 95 Theses to the wall of a church, the former Catholic monk opened the doorway to religous freedom. He also challenged the Catholic notion of celebacy. This is the story of his life in a convent to the diet of Worms, his writing of literature up to his death on February 18 1546. Included is a timeline of the events of Martin Luther's life."
2,Simplistic,"I particularly appreciated the analytic review by ""Orthodox Lutheran Reader."" Historically and psychologically, this particular biographical rendition of Luther is superficial and terribly incomplete. While I realize that a simple, straightforward work on Luther might assist the very young, I do not see how reasonable adults can rate this book with five stars unless their fund of historical and psychosocial information is deficient."
5,A Great Introductory source for all,"For Lutherans and all others this provides some of the best history on Martin Luther, what he knew to be right and practiced. This is a very good book for anyone who has no knowledge of Luther's beginnings.All will find this enlightening when you think of where we are today and the influence Martin had on the world before, during, and after the reformation. It's also an easy read."
1,Don't bother,"I have been working at home and evaluating work-at-home resources for over six years. The majority of the book (60 of its 100 pages) are franchises and biz ops many of which are 100's of dollars up to $15,000. The actual jobs are only a few pages and most of those are assembly work (which I always find suspect), sales, and mystery shopping.While this book does list some work-at-home opportunities, you are much better off to get Lynie Arden's Work-At-Home Sourcebook as its cheaper ($13.95 at Amazon) and offers 100's of more opportunities."
3,Great for kids - not so great for mom,"Seriously, I really do not like this book. There's nothing actually wrong with it, it's just so annoying. You have to say ""boogie, woogie, woogie, oogie"" - or something like that a thousand times. The pictures are nice and bright (and inclusive), but the repetitive text is almost more than I can stand. And unfortunately for me, both my boys have loved this one. I'm giving it a three simply to split the difference."
4,Nice artwork!,This was a blast to work on. Lots of layout drawings. My skill wasn't as good back when this was made. But some of the art looks quite nice.There were some talented artists that worked on it.
2,Not what I expected,"Jovial Bob seemed to have the right idea when put together his computer joke book, but I think something got lost somewhere along the way. I am a big fan of any kind of joke book, and there are some bright spots in Bob's collection, but I found that the material here made me smile more than laugh. Also, I felt that the material could have been arranged better--more cohesively. All in all, a pleasant distraction, but not bust a gut funny."
4,Excellent but dated,"For its time, 1975, this is an excellent work. Weldon wrote it and Zola Levitt reworked it. It discusses a lot of the same type of material Hugh Ross (2002), William M. Alnor (1992) and others discuss in their later books--the statistical impossibility of complex life evolving by chance, UFO's defying the laws of physics, various UFO cults, contactees, the UFO connection to the occult, biblical warnings about interacting with the spirit world, etc. Like the other Christian authors, Weldon and Levitt conclude that UFO's are supernatural paranormal manifestations caused by demons. Readers wanting a general introduction to this view would do better with Alnor and Ross (in that order). Readers familiar with this and wanting older materials specifically to examine views that were being expressed years ago (30 years, now), will find this helpful, as it is one of the few books from that time period written by Christian researchers about the demonic interpretation."
1,Cheep Quality Sash Locks,These are not solid brass sash locks as stated. The quality is very cheep and I would not recommend. I believe this sash lock has been discontinued and now I know the reason why.
1,I would give it ZERO stars if I could,"Do not buy this! After a week, I have sent this to the landfill and purchased a Foodsaver. I even bought a second one and took it back, thinking that there was no way this product could be brought to market and function the way it did. It produces no suction. I doubted my sanity 1,000 times, tried and re-tried to get bags to seal. Only when I brought home the FoodSaver did I realize that the problem is the machine. The FoodSaver works just like the informercial and seals the bag in less than 10 seconds. I wish I had not compulsively sent the box to the gargabe, as I would have loved to get my $99 back instead of just junking this thing. Even a cheap FoodSaver would HAVE to be better than this. I am not sure that the battery ever worked correctly, either. It says that it should last for 25 seals---I don't think it lasted for 2."
5,Cluster Learning Makes it Easy,"I have searched for a good method of learning vocabulary for years. I've spent lots of $$ on the latest word building tapes, CDs and books that taught long lists of words to memorize. The problem is that those words were forgotten only weeks after memorizing them. Recently while cramming for the GRE test, I discovered the ""Discover It"" method described in Danner and Noel's book. It uses a different approach which teaches word clusters instead of individual words, based on the learning the Latin roots of words. This approach saved an enormous amount of study time. The approach allowed me to be able to accurately determine the meaning of a word, even if I had never seen it before. This is a fantastic book. I highly recommend it to anyone wanting to build his/her vocabulary, or take a entrance exam for which he wants to be well prepared."
4,Good quality with no problems.,"Naruto Uncut Season Four Volume 1 was a very dependable product with no scratches, breaks, or skips on any of the disks. The casing of the volume was accidentally cracked when it got to my house as a result of rough shipping, but the seller was true to his word on its fine quality."
5,naruto,I love this show great characters I hope they make another 220 episodes . if you like naruto I recommend soul eater and full metal alchemist I give naruto a solid 10/10 and recommend naruto shippuden its a solid 10/10
4,"simple, but cute","I bought this book for my young son as companion to Food for Thought, which is one of my daughter's favorite books. However, I found Food for Thought to be more creative and educational. The pictures are cute and the book is sturdy and fairly priced. Overall, I would recommend it, but not as much as some of their other books."
2,"A Review of ""Baby Food""","This might be (as suggested by another reviewer) a cute book for a baby shower but it didn't rate highly with my 3 and 5 year olds.First it didn't have a story, and second, 3 and 5 year olds are not as attracted by 'cute' pictures as older children and adults. We looked at the book once and then put it in the 'back to the library' stack.It might be better for older babies and toddlers who could learn something about identifying fruit, but there is plenty of competition that will keep their attention longer.Two Stars. Cute concept, but it didn't make the cut to become a permanent member of our bookshelves. There are just too many other better choices (ones with a story or educational value) on which to spend our money."
3,Africa 101,"Roland Oliver's second edition of this useful book offers good chapters on Africa in the 1990s and an essay about its future as well as and excellent overview of African history. Oliver is expert and thurough. The book is well organized and on the whole interesting. However, because it is an overview the book picks up subjects and drops them in a page or two often after offering just enough to generate genuine interest. This is of course to be expected, but would be more forgivable if the author had included a list of books to read for more information on specific subjects or a bibliographic essay. More troubling is Oliver's tendency to apologize too much for the colonial powers that divided and subjugated Africa. Still, the book is valuable and lives up to its billing."
4,Older book with some valuable information,I have to be truthful and say that I bought this book because it was written by someone I have met during another patent prosecution. I found some of the material dated but was pleasantly surprised as to the amount of content that was still current. If you are easily disappointed I would recommend searching for another title.
2,Not what I expected,"I purchased this for a second closet rod, in my small apartment closet, the concept is fantastic but the product not so much. I received this the box was ripped open, I was missing screws, but that wasn't an issue, but it wouldn't work for my closet situation. The installation was difficult for one person, would not put a lot of weight on this bc it doesn't anchor well into the wall. I am taking this down and replacing it with something else."
2,Great start but fades fast,"This book has what you want in golf but not in literature: fade. It starts off well but as another reviewer pointed out, it is about 100 pages too long. There are way too many characters in the book and very little thematic continuity between them (or none I could discern). The author is very young so there is definitely some potential, though."
2,One of the worst books I've ever read,"I have to say this is one of the worst books I've ever read. The dialogue is horrible, the characters are unbelievable and undeveloped, there is basically no plot. I hate that lesbians will buy any book and see any movie with the word lesbian somewhere. We have to demand better from authors in the alternative segment. Don't continue to support bad writing just because it's lesbian."
3,OOO,"I did not care for this book much, it was well written as all hers is. I have picked it up and put it down several time and this isn't like me. but truly read it you might like it."
1,"If only there were a ""no stars"" option","This would get it. Yuck. Blech. Retch. Barf. Hurl. etc. etc. etc.This was supposed to be a tender tale of romantic discovery. Instead it became one of those tiresome recountings of endless sexual encounters and moaning and groaning (each encounter employing slightly different adjectives and euphemisms, of course ... a rosebud is a rosebud is a rosebud. lol)It's worse than Barbara Cartland on a bender."
2,Naah,This was the first book I had read by this particular author and don't know that I'll buy another. It just didn't do it for me. The language was beyond offensive. The later half of the book was more enjoyable than the first.
4,First Love,I recieved the book in the mail yesturday and I couldn't put it down. I read it in one sitting. This is definately for the hopeless romantics out there. It made me think about that first kiss with the love of my life again. I recommend it for the memories it will rekindle.
3,Another average and light lesbian romance,"PROS1. 2 adult femme ladies in a heterosexual world. To me that is much more credible than any other L word world type of fiction.2. The progressive and smooth development of passion between main characters.3. Excellent sensual descriptions and atmosphere4. Good writting skills5. The author tackles imp aspects of lesbian relationships such as the insecurity of many lesbians towards bisexual women, how many lesbians try to answer that acting as men would, etc.6. Quite advanced for its time, i guessCONS1. The way man are described as kind of beasts2. No real deepening in the main characters personality. Typical flawness in lesbian romance stories.3. Most of the secondary characters seem completely unnecessary and add no value to the story.4. The typical story of love at first sight"
2,Short and just ok.,The book is pretty short for the price. Not the lesbian book I was looking for. Maybe good for people figuring out what they want but there wasn't really a climax it just kind of ended. Enjoyed the Emily D. References though.
5,Romantic and sweet book.,"This is a great book because it explores the emotional and physical attraction between two beautiful women that lead to love. When I visualize Lane I cant help but picture Michelle phieffer and for Diana.... Mitzi Kapture, of Silk Stalkings. I have read the book so many times that I have begun to wonder how would it read if the story was told from Lane's point of view instead of Diana's. I think that many ppl would like to read what was Lane thinking when the cabin door at Lake Tahoe opened and in walked Diana..."
2,Stock genetic thriller,"As already noted in the reviews, the book has all the elements of the genetically-engineered-child-as-bad-seed books that seem to be proliferating lately. You've got the betrayed wife, the amoral doctor who crosses the line into evil, the helpless friends, the works. While it's not terribly plotted, there is also nothing interesting or new.Furthermore, the writing style is uneven. While it picks up steam later in the book, the first few chapters read like a writing workshop exercise, with one adjective per sentence-- ""blinding brightness"", ""bitterly cold"", ""perfect blanket"", and ""southern sky""-- and this all in only the first (short) paragraph."
4,Vastly Researched - Good Read,"I read the reviews on this book and the wide variation stirred my curiosityso I bought it and made my own determination.Yes, there are parts that drag on a bit but one thing kept me reading andthat was the enormous research put into this novel. Not only does it give anaccurate representation of mankind's attempt to skirt the laws and play God,but it also shadows covert political movements and maneuvering as nation goesagainst nation to secure the secret.The book also approaches the agonies of a neglected wife and the man who overlookshis most valued possessions until it's too late. This book is well worth the timeto read it and those who slow down long enough to read it well might even learn afew things.Deborah Owen[...]"
5,Sci-Fi Thriller to the Max,"Wow, Once I started reading ""Jupiter's Daughter"" I couldn't put it down. Continualy leaves you wondering what will happen next, who will survive, and what is in store for Genny's future. The ending was a shock that leaves you anxious for the sequel to come out.Rumor is that a screen play is in the works. I can't wait!"
4,A Fine Example of early 20th century scholarship on the issue,"I agree with an earlier reviewer that the frequent footnotes and quotes in Greek, Latin, French and German elude the modern general reader. Also the introductory chapter giving example after example of modern (17th-19th century) allusions to the various pirate lairs and peoples is a bit overdrawn. I would have preferred that Omerod simply get down to the business of identifying those that were significant in the epoch he covers. That said, this is a quite thorough review of what has passed for illicit and predatory maritime practice in antiquity, which, as the author acknowledges, was often synonomous with outright warfare when dealing with pirate ""empires"" such as Illyria and Cilicia. An apt modern counterpart might be such ""failed state"" piratical entities as present day Somalia or the various embodiments of the Al Queada network."
3,book,"Tis book was also a gift, so I did not read this one either. I am hoping the person I gave it to get some help out of it."
5,Great resource,"Every record of an eclipse, sunspot, nova, auroral event, or other cosmic occurrence from Korea, Japan, and China is documented here -- in English and Chinese. People familiar with Early China will feel right at home with this material; people who are new to East Asian archeoastronomy will find a gold mine of information extremely well documented and explained.You can't ask for much better than this kind of work."
5,Chamber music from mysterious South,"This recording, actually a compilation of two records released by Flying Fish Records in the 70's, provides the bridge between Norman's early solo work and his later efforts with the Rising Fawn String Ensemble. A marvelous mix of original songs (Graycoat Soldiers, Old Brown Case, Billy Gray, Last Train from Poor Valley) and traditional tunes (most interesting - a three-part Cuckoo's Nest) presented with understated elegance, mostly by Norman with Nancy Short (later Nancy Blake), Charlie Collins, Tut Taylor, and Sand Mountain fiddler James Bryan.This one, by the way, drives guitar players crazy due to the fact that Norman doesn't always play in standard (A=440) tuning, preferring to tweak the strings up or down just a bit as it fits the song. Norman once said at a workshop ""Sometimes I guess I just hear a song a little different than standard..."""
4,Pretty Darn Good,"A pretty good DVD giving the viewer the basics so they won't look like a complete fool when hitting the water for the first time. Some things I would disagree with, but more because of style rather than their information being ""wrong"". There is a fair amount of paddling footage spliced in, so if you condensed it down to just the instructional material, it would probably be about 30 min.Still, it is probably the best SUP instructional DVD out right now.There is also some good footage from the 2007 Steinlager SUP competition as a bonus!And, as an aside, BE CAREFUL OF THOSE AROUND YOU!!! I've seen a number of accidents out here--both SUP vs. swimmer and SUP vs. surfer. Not because the SUPer was being malicious or mean, they just didn't know any better and couldn't control the huge board. If that keeps up, SUPs are going to be banned from most areas."
2,better info available elsewhere,"I received this as a gift a few weeks after I bought my board. By that time, my knowledge and experience exceeded the level of instruction in this video. There are plenty of websites dedicated to Paddle Surfing and lots of how-to advice, including video for those averse to reading. Of course nothing can replace personal experience, so step away from the TV and get out on the water.I should preface my comments, though. While most of this DVD was filled with fluff (random shots of wacky antics, people driving, walking on the beach, etc) and devoted a lot of time trying to sell me the next video in the series, there was nothing wrong with the actual instruction. If you have never touched a Stand Up board and don't have internet access, this would be a good buy."
1,Video didn't play at all,I tried 5 times and video didn't play at all. Horrible experience. Need my refund so I can better watch a movie which is available for watch
3,"""The Laughs Are Still There""","""American Pie: The Naked Mile"" continues the ""American Pie"" series as Stifler's younger brother is ready to graduate high school a virgin, something he doesn't want to see happen. This installment is similar to other ""American Pie"" films; it is filled with sexual innuendos, teen-filled romps stories, and gags that will please the most ardent young viewer. The movie is funny and it does have its moments, but I believe the studio and producers are ruining a good thing by constantly releasing different sequels in this franchise. It is really time to stop, but knowing the studios in Hollywood if they can milk money out of a movie franchise they will. This DVD has outtakes, deleted scenes, and more, so if you are an ""American Pie"" junkie buy the DVD; if your looking for good qualirty comedy go else where."
1,"I hated it, he loves it","One of those movies you can walk away from for half and hour, come back and know exactly what is going on.Just another movie for woman to run around naked... no thanks !!!!!Did I mention stupid plot ?!?!?"
4,I Would Have Liked to Been At That Race,"The second entry in the American Pie Presents series introduces two more Stiflers. After getting a free weekend pass from his girlfriend, Erik Stifler, along with his two friends, head to college to visit his cousin, Dwight. Their mostly there to attend the famous Naked Mile, plus Erik hopes to lose his virginity.Just like the other American Pie films, there are few crude scenes, nudity, and language. Of course there is a cameo by Eugene Levy.I only paid a $1.96 for the movie at a Black Friday sale, so I'm mostly satisfied with my purchase. The movie is raunchy, but funny."
2,This is when American Pie truly went downhill...,"The American Pie series is dead to me now. It's not funny, just pathetic. The story line is very predictable. If you're looking for nude girls, this movie has plenty. But why even get this then? If that's what you're looking for, get that because this movie's basically a soft porno with a weak story line."
1,The Worst in the American Pie series,"While I loved previous American Pie movies, this installment is simply a poor effort to squeeze out more money from the American Pie name. The story line is just plain bad, the acting is the worst I've seen in any movie - there are just no redeeming qualities to this movie. Save your time and watch something else."
2,Not That good,"I loved the first two or three American Pie Movies. This movie SUCKS, big time, not worth $20. So, if I where you I would just rent it first."
5,Mike Auldridge,"Mike, I am still using ""Lloyd's of Nashville"" for my Country Ecology radio theme. While the old 33 1/3 album is probably long gone, I need your permission once again to occasionally portray this cut on two CD's I am producing of past environmental shows of two minutes each.We talked about 10 years ago, and you conversed with me about producing some tape cassettes. Hope to produce 1,000 CD's this time X 2. [...]Can anybody at Flying Fish records help me out to make contact???"
1,Digital camera case,"This is the first Amazon purchase (and I have made many) for which I am disappointed. This case was recommended by the Amazon site for the Nikon Coolpix L19 camera, but it is way too small. Camera will not fit in it. The case is too much trouble to return so has ended up being a waste of money."
3,Doesn't fit,"This case does not actually fit the Coolpix camera recommended. However, it is nicely made and it fits my husband's 60 gig iPod incredibly and so is used for that. This would fit a thin camera, but not the Coolpix."
2,This Case doest not fit coolpix S710,"it is said that the case is for nikon coolpix S series. I bought both S710 and this case. However, the case does not fit the camera. it is a little small. when you put the camera in it, it is too tight and can not close."
4,The case of the case.,"I had ordered case the same time I ordered the Nikon Coolpix camera from Amazon. Unfortunately, it did not arrive before I left for Thailand. Thankfully, the camera did which is the most important. I ended up buying a cheap case at a discount store which worked fine.Once home from the trip, the case was waiting for me. I like the solid feel of the case. However, guess I'm a little worried about the 'latch' on the flap. The cheap case I purchased had a zipper to secure the camera. I plan on using the Nikon leather case now. But I'll reserve judgement until I use it more."
2,This case makes no sense.,I purchased the Nikon Coolpix S220 10MP Digital Camera through Amazon and got the suggestion for this case to go with it. Doesn't work. I could probably fit TWO of these cameras in this case. It is way to big for such a thin camera. I returned it.
4,Almost the perfect bag,I just like to add it a extra space for aditional battery. You can carry in your belt and my s600 fits perfect in this bag. Great leather.
5,Nikon Coolpix leather case,This case is durable and convenient for the Nikon Coolpix's. The magnet is not too much and easy to open.Would have liked a place for an extra memory card.Would recommend it for any Coolpix for protecting your camera.
4,Nice case - great price!,This case is very compact but very protective of the camera. It is great to store and carry with you.
2,looks good but was not an exact fit for the camera,the case wasnt an exact fit for nikon coolpix s610.but looks wise it was good
1,Not even a close fit,This carrying case was bundled with the Nikon COOLPIX L20 camera at Amazon. Not even remotely a close fit. Do NOT buy this product for your Nikon L20.
1,Too small for the Nikon L19,This case was suggested for the Nikon L19 I ordered through Amazon. The case was too small and now I have paid for a case that I cannot use.
5,Fully Functional Case for the S60,I find the case to be well made and very functional. A snug fit secures the camera. I particularly like the magnetic closure. The closed loop on the back of the case requires threading the belt through a leather loop. I would have preferred an open hook type belt clasp.Good value considering the overall quality.
5,Fits the S70,"I brought it for the new S70, and it does indeed fit, very nicely. I haven't put any real wear and tear on the case, but it seems like it will hold up."
2,Does Not Easily Fit S710,"Since this was supposedly designed for Coolpix S-series cameras, I figured it would fit my Coolpix S710 just fine... Not exactly. You can get it in there, but it's a very tight fit. I returned it with the hope of finding something better out there. I definitely don't want to play tug-of-war with my camera case every time I get my camera out.Otherwise, it is a very attractive, simple case. I would definitely recommend it for those with a compatible camera."
4,Case for Nikon S70,"Nicely constructed, simple & perfect fit for Nikon S70. Wish it had a small pocket for extra SD card, however."
4,"Handy, no-frills case","A nice, light case for the Nikon camera. (Nikon should just include it.) If you want a samll camera and don't want to cary pheriperal parts, this case does it. It has a belt loop and a magnetic catch. I carried it on my belt through all of a vacation and it worked like a champ."
4,holds it purpose,Great little case-fits my camera just right.Better than paying $30 at retail electronic stores!
4,Doesn't fit S550,"This case seems really nice, but my new S550 is slightly too large to fit in it. I can squeeze the camera in but the flap wont close. I'm hoping they make a slightly larger model, because i really like the case."
1,Deluxe Leather case for Nikon Coolpix S1000 pj,This case does not fit the Nikon Coolpix 1000pj. It is small for that camera although they say it can fit it.
3,Compact Case,It as Compact case to protect your camera. no additional pockets to hold extra SD cards.
4,Fits perfect,Its fitting perfect to my camvery useful to carry the cam anywhereloving itI'll prefer next time I buy similar kind of products
5,Very nice... original Nikon case,"This case is very nice. Nicely made, good fit and a great price. It is genuine Nikon, at a price that can't be beat."
4,Nice Case,"Not quite what I thought it would be, the picture does not show it well. It's a little tight for the camera. It did come in perfect condition, however, it did not come in its original packaging, which I did not like."
3,Nikon brand camera case for Coolpix S series,"Case is small & compact, but does not provide a place for carrying an extra battery or SD card. Would prefer that it had a clip rather than a belt loop attachment. Still a nice case for the money."
5,Stylesh leather case,"Just as i expected from nikon stylesh case , simple , designed for your little camera"
4,Good case,"Holds the camera, looks very nice. The magnet used for closure is much better than velcro or other methods. A very nice case."
2,It didn't fit.,The product arrived in a nice box. Leather looks okay. The only problem was it just didn't fit my Nikon Coolpix.
3,fit is great! quality is great!,"the fitment for my s52 is great! the quality of the leather is great! I even ran it over in my car before and it looks surprisingly fresh hahaha no joke! some problems is that you can accidently press the power button on top of the camera through the case, and you wont even know the camera is on. (has happened a couple times, sucks for battery drain)other than that the main thing is that UPS TOOK FOREVER TO SHIP THIS TO ME!!!!!!!!!! But thats UPS' fault and not amazon. this product rocks :)"
2,Case looks good..But not comfortable.,This case is looks good.But it is not containing too many many pockets.It is not comfortable.
2,Not up to Nikon Standard,"The case is nice and compact, BUT it does NOT offer a compartment for a spare battery AND more egregious is that the case side is too tight over the on/off button that simply sliding the camera into the case can turn the camera on. The camera times out, but if you should squeeze the case in the wrong direction, the camera will turn back on and go through another battery run-down cycle. I had to cut a small slot in the side of my case to alleviate both these conditions."
3,It does fit the Nikon Coolpix S Series but is not a Leather Case,Don't get me wrong this is a good case and it fits perfectly the Nikon Coolpix S210 I give to my girl. But this is NOT at any way a leather case. This seems to be synthetic leather a material that resembles leather. I was suspecting it due to its low price. Overall this is a good case for the S series even though it looks a bit cheap.
5,Coolpix S550 and Leather Case,"I am completely satisfied with my purchase of a Nikon Coolpix S Series leather case. It is a sturdy case with genuine leather and a magnetic closure. My camera did not come with a case so it was taking a beating. Now, with the case, I will get years more reliability out of the camera.The price, including free shipping, was under $11.00 dollars....a very fair deal.The camera, bought from another vendor, has performed beyond my expectations and I wouldn't hesitate to buy either item again.The case was my first Amazon purchase but not my last.Thanks"
2,Does Not Fit S60,I bought the S60 CoolPix and this case was offered in a combined offer. The case is alright but it is too tight for the S60. Bad Amazon!
1,Does Not fit Nikon L20,"I believed Amazon gave recommendations on comnpanion items that are compatable. This case was shown to be purchased with the Nikon L20, but it is too small. I saw another review that shows the same thing. I can not understand why Amazon continues to sell the case with a camera when it doesn't work. I bought this as a gift and am very embarassed as it is useless as a case for the L20 camera"
2,TO SMALL,THE CAMERA CASE WAS TO SMALL FOR MY NIKON COOLPIX S60 I LED TO BELIEVE THAT IT WAS TO FIT MY CAMERA.
1,Too Streamlined,"This case came with a Nikon Coolpix S600 I recently purchased. The camera DOES fit in it, but that is all. There is no room for the wrist strap, an extra battery, or even a slim memory card. Also there is no belt clip, just a loop. The padding protection is minimal.I plan to purchase a nice, small Lowepro Ridge 10 case that will accommodate the camera and the few accessories I need to carry with it. Nikon could have done much better with this one. I'd recommend against wasting one's money on it -- a much better case can be purchased in the same price range."
1,Don't bother,This case is practically too small (too tight to use) I have an S51 and am very disappointed with the extreme tight fit.
1,Do not use for Coolpix S710,"If you have a S710 like I do, I don't recommend the purchase of this. It really doesn't fit - the case is too small for this camera. It is difficult to put the camera in the case and next to impossible to get it out. Also, this is advertised to be leather, but it has the look and feel of vinyl to me."
4,Great overall,This is a great fit for the ccolpix S series. I gave it four stars because the loop in the back requires your belt to be ran through it. It should have been like a cellphone holder in which you can clip it on and off without dealing with your belt.
4,Nice product. discription is a little misleading.,The Dalek does not come with Rose and spider figures like the product discription says. The dalek mutant inside is a little hard to see (it is darkly colored). However it is a very neat product. I am very happy with it.
3,"almost satisfying, but not quite","it was ok, but i wish that it opened like a real dalek. (i.e. the picture on the package)the sucker thing breaks off easily but it is slightly more poseable than the original 2005 series non mutant reveal.i recommend it for a person new to doctor who"
2,Need different sizes,"It seems no matter whnich phillies shirt I order, the sizes only mostly change the length, but they don't get much bigger in the body."
1,Low Audio,"Audio quality was very bad and the volume very low for most of the movie. It seems the reason for this is so the sound can be very loud during the climatic scene. The end result is I blew out my speakers during that scene.As a friend commented, ""Dude! You've rented some bad movies before, but this is the first one that did physical damage!"""
1,I bet guestar57 likes it,"When you go to the video store and see the Asylum logo, you can be sure that that movie will be a $#!* fest. But any day now guestar57 will post a positive review for this *ahem* movie (watch and see) I guess thats their idea of marketing, writing a glowing review of their own movies. You would think that making a movie wouldnt be so hard, but the talent free people at Asylum prove that movie making isnt easy. Take the ninety or so minutes to watch this movie and hit your head against a wall, it wont be as painful an experience."
1,Can't Believe They Made A 2nd One After Viewing THIS!,"This movie was horrible. I can't believe they made the 2nd movie. ""Snakes On A Plane"" was an excellent movie. But, this one was just awful. I can't believe this movie was such a hit that they made the 2nd movie. Recommend ""Snakes On A Plane"" but NOT this one."
3,Snakes on a chew-chew train!,All aboard the Tijuana Express! They're serving cheese in the dining car for SyFy-channel afficionados. The on-board flick has a grab bag of hokey B-movie thrills: voodoo curses; lots of garter snakes and green gelatin; boa babes and a bombastic chew-chew-train finale. Exploitation fare that gives you exactly what you deserve!
4,snakes on a train,i liked the movie all though some things could have been done just a little beter. i ride the train into the city and i think what if this hapened to this train.
1,DON'T BOARD THIS TRAIN,"Silliness runs amok in this rip-off of SNAKES ON A PLANE. A cursed Hispanic woman and her shaman lover board a train illegally to get to Los Angeles to find the one person who can remove the curse.The movie claims to have 100 passengers and 3000 snakes---there's only about 15 passengers and maybe 50 snakes, a couple of them who grow very big with no explanation. And then there's the hilarious ending that I won't spoil for those unfortunate enough to rent or God forbid buy.Overall bad production values and laughable acting make this a prime contender for one of cinema's worst snake movies."
1,"really, really, really bad","I hated this movie. It sucked. Don't even consider it. I'd pick up a copy of 'Snakes on a Train in Canada' if you like this kind of silliness, you'd get a much better laugh."
1,Voodoo on a train,The story is a woman has been voodoo cursed and is headed into town for a cure but on the way she unleashes a bunch of snakes from her body that terrorize a trains passengers. The fact that the snakes come from her stomack and that they look like giant worms is a warning all by itself. The asylum continues to put out Cheap Spin-offs that completely flops and makes its origins sick.
1,Gag fest,"I have seen it all, from rip-offs of the Blade series to the worst that the scifi channel has to offer. So when i say this i mean it from the bottom off my heart that this is the worst movie that i have ever seen. At least when the scifi channel makes a movie they try to integrate scionco and original content, this movie doesn't even try to do either. I would say that this movie isn't even worth 1 star out off 5. Whats next for The MALLACHI BROTHERS,probably Snakes in a car. Since my mother always seid that if you don't have anything nice to say about someone don't say anything at all, there isn't anything good to say about Snakes on a Train so ill shut up now."
1,Terrible,"For their credit, this is one of their more competent pieces of crap, and that's because there's considerably good gore, and an interesting take on ripping off ""Snakes on a Plane."" But, if there's any more of example of the inconsistency behind Asylum's newest rip-off it's the two characters at the beginning whom are illegal immigrants and can't understand nor speak English to a Texas man sneaking them across the border, yet when they get on a train and meet a friend, they begin understanding and speaking perfect English.Aside from being a pretty bad depiction of a Hollywood formula, ""Snakes on a Train"" is utterly boring. Asylum scores yet again with a hackneyed, lazy, horribly directed, and boring rip-off of another better film. ""Snakes on a Train"" takes itself way too seriously, and that's why it's never entertaining or memorable."
1,"These ""Snakes"" are missing in action.","Here's some advice: if you're gonna make a movie called ""Snakes on a ""Train"", you might NOT wanna save the snakes until the last 5 minutes. Even more so about the ending, which involves not a Snake on a Train, but rather a train in a snake. No doubt about it.A die-hard fan of SNAKES ON A PLANE, I rented SOAT, and thought it would be good. Instead, it was just worse than I thought it would be. Here's what's wrong:1. Firstoff, let me say that this movie is BORING- The snakes aren't even unleashed until the ending.2. When I see a film with a tagline that includes ""1000 venomous vipers"", I EXPECT THERE TO BE VIPERS. THere was only one viper and the rest are just ball pythons and Garter Snakes (WTF?)3. The characters are underdeveloped, and totally, are boring.4. TERRIBLE S/FX! (Spoiler) WHen the chick turns into a basilisk at the end, the S/FX are terrible!So AVOID THIS AT ALL COSTS!"
1,were they kidding with this movie,"I am going to have to agree with G. Kent below for the most part. However the only difference is that im pretty sure i hate this movie more and would give it negative stars if i could. Where to begin. First of all the story line is absolutly ludacris. I watched it for 20 minutes and kept asking myself is this really what this movie is about. Halfway through u only know the name of maybe one character.This movie is honestly from the bottom of my heart, without the slightest imaginable bit of exhageration, the worst movie ive ever seen. I think i could make a better movie with my cell phone and 14 year old brother. Dont do to yourself what i did to myself...dont watch this movie unless your being paid a very large amount of money to do it. its a total flop...gag!!"
2,Yet another knock off of an already poor horror movie.,"Incase the title hasn't already tipped you off, this is a knock off of Snakes on a Plane. And incase that didn't tip you off, this movie isn't very good... Funny, but not very good...I like to watch cheesy horror movie because they make me laugh, and this one did it for me rather nicely.The plot is rather simple, cursed Mexican chicka gets on on a train with her boyfriend in an attempt to reach a shaman in LA who can cure her, but she keeps barfing up posionous snakes (which are somehow part of her) while she keeps getting weaker & weaker and the other passengers get deader & deader.Wrought with plenty of gore, cheesy lines, and a ""WAKE UP AUDIENCE!!!"" nude scene, this movie is a hilarious way to spend an hour or two of free time!This movie gets 2 stars for the epic horror movie that it was supposed to be, but for a funny cheese fest, it gets 3.5!Also Recommended:SpidersSpiders 2Supergator"
5,twinklefairy hugs,"This movie was pretty much the best movie i have ever seen! With horrible acting and what could be the worst special effects EVER this movie will make u whoopie in ur pants! With an acidtrip ending which was probably written while the scren writer was high on every drug known to man ull be left sitting on ur couch thinking wtfmate! With random creepy perverts, nudity, bloodsplatters, and little girls getting eaten by snakes u could either find this movie oggly dolefus or peefizzle wankleburg! THE PUMKIN OVERLORDS DO NOT NEED TO EXPLAIN THEMSELVES!!!!!! anyway buy this movie or else pandas will eat your face! also watch vampire assasin SO SAY THE PUMPKNI OVERLORDS!"
5,"Ghastly true, but sad.","This book is very well written. I live in the immmediate area that these crimes took place, unfortunately, and I can testify that all accounts written in this book are enormously accurate. She did not miss a single detail."
3,Can't Like It Cuz It's So Horrific,"I heard about this crime from a t.v. show and wanted to know more. I haven't been able to read more than a few chapters a day (I usually devour true crime) because this is the singularly most horrific true crime story I've ever know. The story is written well enough, considering the subject. If you like truly gory, senses defying cruilty and nightmares, then you must read this book."
3,No photos!,"The cover of this books says, ""8 Pages of Photos"" and there are NO photos! The crimes described in this book are fascinating in their bizarre cruelty however I find Ms. Fletcher's writing to be a bit maudlin. She describes an elderly man searching for recyclables, ""he could trade them for a few dollars, and he would be able to buy food today. If not, he would eat Alpo."" Ugh, pul-eeze. I am currently writing to Robin Gecht and he adamantly proclaims his innocence and suggests that Ms. Fletcher write for Stephen King. I also find it interesting that the only person actually executed for these crimes (Andrew Kokoraleis, in 1999) wasn't mentioned until over half-way through the book. This is a very intriguing series of murders that is not well known throughout the ""serial killer"" world. Good book to own if you can get it [inexpensively] and used."
1,A loser in most every way,"Good: Motor drive speed. Grip feel. Takes Nikon lenses. Reacts fast to pressing the shutter release.Bad: Skin tone renditions a color other than skin. White balance doesn't balance well. Noise at anything above ISO 200, looks like 3200. CF card door tough to open. Screen fogs if you breathe when you shoot. Battery cover is not part of the battery. Button placement not as intuitive as on the D100. 4.1MP allows for virtually no cropping of enlargements.Dumped mine a month after I got it."
2,Buy the D70,"A close friend made the unfortunate mistake of plunking down 2 grand for this camera. Honestly Olympus produces cameras that can do the same thing for $400. I've used hers and the image quality is horrible and the colours are wrong 9 times out of 10. If you're going to spend that much on a camera, get the D70 instead and buy a nice extra lens or some other gadgets to go with. The pictures are better and it offers more MP."
2,larger than advertised,"Amazon lists the hight of this as 2"", but it's actually 2.75"" tall. This makes it too tall to access anything in the back of the drawer. The only way to use the space in the back is to take the divider out of the drawer, get what you need, and then put it back in the drawer."
2,deja vu,this book was good for the firt 6 chapters it was intersting but from than on he was saying the same thing stay out of the joint dont get caught and the fact that he is callin the people that are readin the book stupid is just outraugosley rude he thinks he knows everything well owell its not my fault u were sellin drugs in the first place i give it 2 out 5 stars
1,Not worth your time!,"I don't understand all the fawning over this book and author. I found the book pointless and frankly after reading the other one star review I finally put this into perspective. This book is the author's attempt to be cool and make other adults look bad. I agree don't waste your money or your time.I entered into this conversation just to make a comment and to have a voice. Sadly, I see that this book also promotes a good deal of anger from its supporters. The right fighting and the sarcasm along with the need to silence others voices is just plain wrong. I hope the author doesn't sanction this kind of behavior."
3,Busnell Dusk to Dawn 1.5 - 4.5,Scope fogs up more than I would have expected. Wanted a smaller scope for faster handling. Wish now would have went with a more expensive fog proof model.
2,looks nice...,"This scope felt nice and looked cool and everything, and IS VERY CLEAR when looking through it..the buttons/dials were all nice, seemed like a good buy, however i experienced the same problem as other reviewers with something coming loose during firing..returned for refund..you may get a good one you may not. but with amazon's easy returns you can take a chance on it. Its such a nice scope, but not shock proof? thanks amazon.."
1,Won't hold Zero,Wasted lots of ammo/money trying to figure out why my shots were all over the place.Really liked the scope and wanted it to be something else.
5,Great hunting scope,"I bought one of these last year to use on a Marlin .30-30 for close range woods deer hunting. Great field of view, no problems in cold wet weather, got two deer in two shots. I'm thinking of buying up to 4 more for my .22 rifles, slug gun and my competition rifle.Price here can't be beat. I don't remember if it came with rings and I don't see them mentioned in the ad so beware of that."
1,Only for small calibers,"I bought this for my 44 mag. Super Blackhawk and was really disappointed. First the split rings are cheap, hard to mount properly, and unless loc-tited will not stay snug. The scope itself seems fairly sturdy, a little heavier than I had hoped but not unreasonably so. It is lighter than my 2x Burris scope for the same gun. After mounting and bore sighting, worked to get it sighted in. Groups started off good but then started widening with shots erratically printing all over. Had two other shooters check to make sure I wasn't the problem. After 50 rounds many of the shots wouldn't land on the target at 35 yds. Re-mounted to a 22 Long bolt action with the exact same results (this rifle usually puts 5 shots in a inch or less of the bench at 50 yds.) I've usually had good luck with Bushnell but this one doesn't seem built to handle heavy recoil and there are lighter options for a lower recoiling pistol."
5,Bushnell Red Dot,"I am very happy with the red dot, the service and speed at witch I got the scope was great."
1,red dot scope,"unusable, better off with iron sightsi got this scope to replace my 15 year old tasco red dot on a .22 caliber hand gun, thinking it should have new technology and improvementsnot so, switch does not function properly and has to be moved back and forth to make a good contact and to remain onpower setting markings on the dial are not aligned correctly and off setting is somewhere at the number four mark???? - could not adjust itred dot is not a ""dot"" but a blurry star like apparition that is spread out in all directions on the internal prism, making aiming impossible even at lower power settingsanyhow, i do not know if these scopes are all this bad or just the one i had, but i will not buy another bushnell productreturned for refund"
4,I was impreesed!!,"i have to say i was a bit of a skeptic when i got the book but after reading it does put u in a better, art state of mind, i loved the fact that on just about every page is a personal drawing and caption from dannys own journals...what i didnt like about the book was: it seemed there was a large about of time spent on trying to convince the reader that no matter what, they will do a good job and to give the journalling a try, i'm sure he had his reasons for tryin to convince the reader of soo much, but i got a little annoyed with it, however overall the book was rather good and even if u just skip through all the pep talks its still an awesome book!!"
4,Believe in Your Art Ability,"This is a fantastic book on believing in your ability to be an artist. It also teaches you to do art on a daily basis to stretch and grow in the varied mediums.I have kept journals for years, but never art journals. I was amazed at all of the fantastic work that can come from drawing on a daily basis. I even started drawing with pen rather than pencil to allow the mistakes to be there and not be afraid of them.I would recommend this to anyone who doesn't believe they have any talent in art and for those who do and have been told over and over again that they just aren't quite right for 'today's art market'. Get out there and draw!"
5,On behalf of my wife...,"Bought this as a gift for my wife, who struggles with finding time and inspiration to do more paintings and spend more off-time after work being creative. 2 kids and a job can take a lot of time...This book has been one with many creative ideas and small, inspiring notes that have kept her thinking more about her artwork. Whenever she picks it up, it gives her just that small bit of inspiration to spend some time in the evening on an art project.Which is better than I'd hoped."
2,Pages are to busy to be of use to me,This book may have good information in it but I had such a difficult time with the visual clutter I gave up on reading it after a few attempts. I realize it was designed to show creativity and such but on a practical note its not a functional tool if its so distracting it can't be read. The pages are similar to the cover art style with the addition of fonts that are difficult to read. Very busy! I gave myself permission to give it away.
4,The Creative License,Thoroghly enjoyed it. Will start doing the exercises tomorrow. Simple and effective for the busy schedule.
1,Condescending and Annoying,"I found this book condescending and annoying, though I have enjoyed some of his other books/works. The other thing that was extremely irritating was the font. He chose a ""handwriting"" font but it was so small it was difficult to read. After the first couple of chapters of him barking at his readers to be more like him, I tossed it aside and said NEXT! It did inspire me to go out and find other, better books on how to draw, though. Argh!"
2,Not for someone who is already an artist,"I am an artist who has hit a creative ""doldrum."" Therefore, I was looking for a book that would help spur my creativity. However, I did not find this book to be at all helpful with regards to this aspect. It is geared towards people who are not yet artists and don't think that they could ever become one. Mr. Gregory spends most of the book explaining to people that anyone can draw...it may not be awesome realistic drawing, but a drawing nonetheless. If you need encouragement to step out and start drawing, then by all means get this book. If you are like me - steer clear!!"
4,Became an artist in his mid 30's,"I got the book for class, but been wanting to read it before that. Danny Gregory is everywhere on the web, there are a bunch of artist that i love linked to him. And he has a great inspiring story to share with everyone.He promotes journals, but you have to draw on them, everyday, and put down not only what worrys you but the beautiful things in your life as well . That way not only you have a record of your story, but your drawings improve, and you have a record of your improvement.Who cares if your drawings are not the way you think they should be. like he says ""shut up and draw""; you'll see you start to get better.The book it self is hard to read,it is not a book to read from cover to end in one sitting. Probably you won't even want to. You might be puting it down to draw your self."
5,Great story!,"If you're looking for a cute, simple story for a little one, by all means buy this book! It is just so cute - how the animals all get to take a ride in the happy man's dump truck. The pig goes first, and gets a great slide down the back of the truck whenever the man tips the dumper when he sees a friend. Then, all the other farm animals hop on and the happy man takes them for a long ride. They look as if they're laughing when they slide down the back of the truck whenever the man tips the dumper. This is such a cute, simple story and one that needs to be shared to the next generation. It's very well loved in our house and particularly makes a nice gift for the child that loves dump trucks. Highly recommend!"
5,"""Happy Man! Happy Man!""","That's what my two-year olds call out to have read aloud to them. The premise is very different from many other children's books; the plot, such as it is, consists of a rough shaven driver of a dilapidated truck taking farm animals for a ride. My kids recognize the animals and can imitate the sound each animal makes thanking the driver. Charming illustrations, too. I thank Golden Books for bringing back this series of classics from my youth in time for my boys to enjoy."
5,Terrific! A simple story that a toddler can follow.,This is one of the few books that I have found in which a toddler can follow along by virtue of enjoying and being captivated by the pictures. Most of my daughter's toddler books are actually strings of pictures.
5,Cute story,bought this for my 23 mo old son. Loves dump trucks so this is a perfect pick. Recommend to all children who love cars and trucks. Just a happy story!
5,My Grandson book,My son had this book as a child and when his son was born it was a natural fit. Excellent
2,Meh.,"Not my favorite of the Classic Little Golden Books. It's one of those that is not only void of any plot or pleasant rhyme, I feel like the pictures are just so-so at best. My daughter enjoys it because she thinks it looks like fun to slide down the back of the truck, but I'm not a fan."
2,I would look elsewhere.,"Purchased this (& several other) Golden Books for my kids (under 5 yrs old). The artwork is nice but the story is rather pointless. One of the redeeming qualities of these classic old books is a redemptive theme or underlying character message. The man essentially tips farm animals in his dump truck for fun. Given the great reviews, I suppose I had hoped for more.Two alternatives from the same classic period I would recommend exponentially over this: The Fire Engine Book (heroism, courage) or Animal Orchestra (instrument recognition/introduction, teamwork).p.s. - Kudos to Amazon for the 4-for-3 promotion."
2,"Cute, but not safe","All these Little Golden Books remind me of my childhood and love them all. However, I purchased this one for my 2yo daughter. It is just fine, but it describes putting the farm animals in the back of the truck then dumping it. Really not a problem to me as an adult, but I don't want my child to think that that type of play is acceptable as it is a touch aggressive/violent (for lack of better words). I am not usually this type of person obsessed with safety and being PC and all, but I tossed this book. Just my opinion."
2,Durability is inadequate,"The product seemed to have the qualities requested, but after only 3 weeks of usage, it started tearing apart. Crappy material. Nice design, but made with material that does not last very long. Especially for the price we paid.Would not recommend this product for more than a few times of usage."
2,It works,"It works, but don't expect quality or looks here. The drywall screws are completely worthless. The hooks are oddly positioned. Instruction manual might as well not exist.Pros:It does what it's supposed toGood support with proper screwsCons:Drywall screws/mountsHooks awkward"
3,Equipping the Saints,"I haven't started to read yet, but I'm not sure this was the book i wanted, wirth the same title(author)"
4,White Shadow Art Work for season 2 is wrong!!,"If Fox is using the season 3 art work, for the season 2 set, does that mean they will use the season 2 art work for the season 3 set? Or does that mean that they did that so they wont have to release the season 3 set at all???This is the best show ever made by far, but, I cant give it 5 stars if 20th Century Fox can't put it out with the correct art work.A picture with season 3 characters on the season 2 episodes set just doesnt make any sense!!"
5,This Season Improves Upon The First .....,"Another school year at Carver High and while some things have changed much has remained the same. The early episodes of this season still has Coach Reeves attempting to win the complete trust of his players. However, outside forces, such as an embittered and wronged black student,attempt to sabotage the players-coach relationship. Another excellent episode is when a new player suddenly dies during practice shortly after making the team. These are just a couple of examples of how The White Shadow was ahead of its time when it came to television series' about high school. The young generation may think this show is dated but if you grew up watching this show as I did, you'll appreciate and reminisce."
5,the white shadow season 2,After all these years it was great getting to view my favorite show when I was young! I can remember there was no vhs back in those days and having to record each episode via tape recording. Thanks for finally getting these on dvd. I await the third season.
1,The Worst Salsa,The worst band I have ever heard in my life.It just sucks.Japanese can never play Salsa.
3,Stupid teenage boy,"This is the first non-fantasy/sci-fi book from Le Guin that I have read. She creates her two main characters well, and isolates them from the real world. The male narrator operates on his own terms, something which seems to defeat him a bit by the end.As far as a coming of age novel--this offers something new, but at the same time its the same old ""I am so different from everyone else, I am going to difficult and whiney"" Finding a teenage audience for this book is not hard, most teens would agree with much of what the protagonist is saying and in that it has to be acknowledged that teens aren't that different from each other in that aloneness.The relationship that the boy and girl have is what is nice about this story. I just have no love for the narrator, I found him stupid and self centered, without any reason for it. You can be different and an outcast without such undeserved amounts of angst, that frankly frustrated me."
4,A short read that will stick with you for a long time,"When I read this book I was taken back to my own high school experience, which shows how good this book was because it is set in a very different time period, but still speaks to me. The thing that jumps out at me is the uncertainty of the main character. He is trying very hard to figure life out and that's a journey we all go on. Love, family, and friendship all seem to redefine themselves in our formative teen years, and it is during this time of confusion and change that we are expected to make some of our most important life decisions. I think this topic is something all readers can relate to, and I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is a teenager or has ever been a teenager."
5,Excellent novel for the high school crowd,"As a long-time teacher, I was delighted in this book which is open and honest about the feelings of adolescents. It has a positive message and shows young people discovering sexuality and choosing to delay sexual activity, an important message for youth today."
2,Cranes abroad,"I have appreciated Matthiessens's other wild life books & his novels - here, though I haven't finished & there may be a payoff, I find his ecotourism, the discovery of Crane nesting areas in different countries too episodic"
5,Heaven is a Matthiessen book,"I first read Peter Matthiessen in the 1970s: ""The Snow Leopard"", and was so moved by his writing that I began to read everything I could find that he authored. I have never been disappointed. ""The Birds of Heaven: Travels with Cranes"" is, like his other books scholarly and absolutely sings with his love of the subject. And the included art is breathtaking. With International Crane Foundation as well as other authorities on wildlife conservation, Matthiessen has written another book that will transport the reader to numerous countries, under numerous skies to see and hear the ancient bugling of the birds of heaven."
5,Clint is the man!!!,Unbelievable jazz guitar player. This video is just fun to watch how amazing this man is!!
4,i IS FOR iNNOCENT,"I is for Innocent She has some human interest, humor and depth in her novels. They are short enough to remain intertaining"
4,sue grafton,"Definitely not heavy reading but also definitely pleasurable. I just ordered another one of her books, hopefully i will enjoy it too,"
3,I is for Intriguing!,"The authenticity of character development makes this a fantastic read, however, I gave it three stars for two reasons: 1. the section where the girl from the motel says she can identify the truck from a moments glance at it from an accident that she witnessed 5 years ago was unrealistic and 2. when it was discovered who ""dunnit"" we never got to find out why from the ""horse's"" mouth (just left to assume she was murdered for reasons made obvious from earlier descriptions of the relationship between Isabelle and her killer). I would have liked to hear more from the murderer but overall I would recommend this book for fans of Grafton. I will definitley go on to indulge in J is for Judgment!"
5,"Once you Start, it is hard to put down!","Very good book, in the alphabet series, but one of the more complicated ones. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good mystery!"
5,GOT ANY TIME TO READ WITHOUT PUTTING THE BOOK DOWN?,"This book is excellent-as all of Sue Grafton's Kinsey Millhone books that I've read. Sue really knows how to make the story intriguing, yet without making it too suspenseful. And Kinsey is not the most typical P.I. either; for one thing she's a woman and for another thing, she's the hard-butted detective that we all crave for in our books. She's also bitingly funny even at the most mysterious moments.So let's give Sue and Kinsey a high-five."
4,Is he or is he not?,"Kinsey's ""I"" outing is a doozie. After the PI who was originally on the case dies suddenly, Kinsey is tapped to replace him. His files are a mess, the murder took place 5 years ago, but she's determined to earn that paycheck. And it's only by dint of her dogged insistence on getting to the truth that Kinsey finally discovers the truth. Other deaths occur - are they related? Several suspects emerge. Hitherto unknown crimes are brought to light. She's got her hands full, but Kinsey's smart and resourceful, and eventually, she figures things out, and it's not a pretty picture."
2,"Lots of fluff, but little substance","Grafton writes a lot of details and descriptions throughout the book which are irrelevant, add nothing to the story, and slow the pace down. It is neither intriguing nor suspenseful as she overly tells the story. The writing and editing were disappointing and lacking."
4,Sony IR video light,"The product is a good product, durable and well constructed. The performance seems to be best for 15 - 20 foot of illumination. If you are trying to go farther, you need a bigger light. The best function is of course the fact that it can operate with 2 AA batteries and also the Sony InfoLithium batteries. This light is a really good light and I would recommend it."
5,"Yes Sir, This is the One!!!!!!","Just receivd this bad boy in the mail. It sits perfect on top of my Mauser 30-06. A fine, fine upgrade from my Swift 3-9X32! Lol. No, seriously, BUY THIS ONE! Its from a company that I have used for years and has never dissappoited. Go for it."
3,Good book..but...,"Why is this book going for such high prices? It's not really THAT good! Granted, I love The Phantom of the Opera..and I am a Leroux purist when it comes to Erik...but one can purchase the individual Leroux stories that are found in this text...and save a ton of money. I suppose the hike in price is because of all the hype that has transpired with the coming of the newest ALW Phantom movie, but do not waste your hard earned cash on this book.....Borrow it from your library, or have them Interlibrary Loan it for you. You won't be disappointed then..."
3,I was bummed,"I was looking forward to seeing this movie. I like Asia Argento, she was good in XXX and I wanted to see more of her, in more ways than one. I got my chance with Scarlet Diva. Before the movie starts she has a little monologue, asking the viewer not to be afraid of the movie, not to judge it because it was going to be honest and it might have some disturbing scenes and themes in it, to some viewers at least. So I'm thinking alright! No punches pulled in this movie. But there just weren't that many punches to pull. I mean she goes to buy dope from some has been british rapper, she attempts to use street slang, sag her pants and show off her thong, and it just comes across a little incredulous. I was sort of shaking my head and laughing and I found myself doing that a lot during the movie. She gave it a good try though and maybe she will come through in her future efforts, but this movie I'm afraid is a two star effort with an extra star for Asia getting naked at least. Sorry Asia!"
1,Don't Believe The Hype,"Don't waste your time or your money on this movie. Asia is VERY hot, but this movie is terribly boring. There aren't even enough skin or sex scenes featuring Asia to make it worth watching. It's a poor, low-budget, student-film with a horrible soundtrack."
2,Chaotic,"This is a semi-autobiographical movie directed by Italian film starlet, Asia Argento. The movie is rather chaotic, which may fit with the life being portrayed, but does not make for a very good movie. The lead character, played by Asia herself, flits around from one strange incident to another - partially out of loneliness, partially out of looking for love and companionship, and partially trying to find her niche in life. It's a sad story filled with drugs and wrong choices - or at least what appear to the viewer as wrong choices. Unfortunately, disconnected from any explanation of the significance of the movie, it leaves one feeling like they wasted a few hours of time watching something rather pointless.The interview on the DVD of Asia Argento sheds some real light on the meaning behind the movie and had I watched that first I might have interacted with the story differently. Even with the interview as background I don't consider this to be a particularly good movie."
1,"1 Star for the Flick, 5 for the Juggs.","This movie was so low brow and low budget it was sad to watch.It was more of a movie about Asia's secret passions, take the first scene in the trailer, getting taken from behind by the black guy...gimme a break.The only thing and I mean the ONLY thing worth watching in this train wreck was the young woman toward the end with the HUGE breasts! I mean my mouth dropped at how sexy that woman was.For the rest of the film...I spit on the time I wasted fast forwarding to the nudity.Oops, I mean to the good parts.LUV MOMS"
1,junk,I always loved Italian movies so ok lets try something new.Big disappoinment.Compare to Tinto Brass this movie is a shadow.Pointless.Lousy sex scenes.Brrrrr.But!Better than French anyway.
3,WTF?,"I bought the movie because I heard it was pretty explicit, Asia is hot as hell, and it had alot of noise about it. But the only amusing thing was the explicit sex, unfortunately the rest of it made me want to stab my eyes and ears. Rent it if you really want to see it, don't jump straight ahead and buy it."
2,Any movie that begins with an apology can't be very good,"I was very disappointed with this movie. I've never heard of Asia Argento, so I was just kinda trying it out. Yeah, she's fine. This story however wanders aimlessly all over the screen in a way that is very disruptive to the enjoyment of its artsy-ness. I was particularly disappointed with the soundtrack. It seemed that the story being so out of focus was in need of some beat poetry to bring it together. Maybe the very artsy people will like this one, but I've got a better recommendation. Sex and Lucia.I would usually consider myself a very art-oriented person, but Scarlet Diva did nothing for me but anger me at the lack of art in an ""artsy"" shell. I wouldn't recommend this unless you're a huge Asia Argento fan in which case, you're gonna buy it anyways."
3,Free TV Watching,Italian girl climbs show-business leader up while refusing sex-for-success and finding herself with a couple of partners with no recollecting of actions themselves.A bit messy and illogical movie of an alone beauty not knowing her priorities is nice to watch on a free TV.
3,"Disjointed, disturbing, dysfunctional.","Disjointed, disturbing, dysfunctional.All of these adjectives, apply to this semi-autobiographical movie. Anna Battista is a successful actress in Italy, whose life is a series of wrong decisions. The hectic and disordered life of a young successful actress is very well depicted. Ms. Argento has shot a promising movie. There are shades of Fellini in this film, there is tragedy and also some elation, and finally, hope. The DVD has an interview with Asia and a commentary by her on the movie. This adds some texture and enhances our understanding of the movie.All in all, an interesting film to watch; but not for everyone. Buy it if you are an Asia Argento fan, or if you like Fellini."
1,Self-Indulgent Home Movie,"I'm not that familiar with Asia Argento, but the photo shoots I've seen of her are great. She's a beautiful girl and, from what I understand, an up-and-coming actress.But this movie played like a self-indulgent and occasionally pretentious home movie. Characters play like caricatures. Anybody buying this film for copious nude scenes with Asia will probably be disappointed--unless you're riveted by her shaving her armpits in a long bathroom scene.Otherwise, you're watching her catch planes, travel, score some drugs, chase a musician, etc.And it all looks like a home movie."
4,"Great actress, good movie","Being a fan of Asia Argento for years, from her father's (Dario Argento) movies and to The Heart is Deceitful..., I found this ""autobiographical"" film a bit disturbing, but also a broader display of her talents. From start to finish it is a cynical look at the downside of fame. No holds barred here, we follow the main charector, Anna,as she searches for respectability, love, and a clean slate fora new beginning.It seems Asia let loose a lot of inner turmoil in this film, including the ""rock star"" relationship, which mirrored real life, and the strained relationship with her mother, Daria Nicolodi (who plays the overbearing mother in the film).The best part of this dvd in my opinion, is the commentary by the director/star. That's where you get a real feel for the lady behind the story and gain some understanding about the story."
1,There were no subtitles,"I am anxious to watch this movie but there were no subtitles on the DVD. I ordered two copies and it was the same thing on both. Contrary to what a couple of reviewers have said about those that are complaining about no subtitles, I have over 400 DVDs in my collection and surely know how to turn subtitles on and off. Clearly, a batch was distributed here in the US without English subtitles.This is unfortunate."
3,"Excellent Concept, Lousy Execution!","Like the others, my 3 year old loved playing with this fun toy for about an hour or two, but the next day when he pushed the button it no longer worked. For some mysterious reason, under the plastic cap had literally burned and melted. I emailed step2 and they immediately sent a replacement. Also, the design is so cheap and flimsy, the upper river really could use much stronger support. A shorter leg beneth the track near the lighthouse would probably solve this. Lastly the pump is quite week, cheap and noisy. I am really trying to be fair here, but I'm afraid even the new pump will only last a short time and I will be repeating this infuriating process of contacting step2 for a new part every couple of weeks/months. Again, incredibly imaginative concept, absolutely horrible execution and design. Step2, please re-design and fix!"
2,So much fun but broke within 2 weeks,"Oh how my 2 and 4-year-olds loved this toy. And I thought it was just fabulous out of the box but the motor is so noisy, it is quite shocking. This same motor burned out within 2 weeks of buying this. My kids still played with it for the rest of the summer, using a bucket to pour the water up top after the motor broke. They loved it THAT much.If the motor was better, this toy would be such a winner. Step2, if you read this PLEASE fix the motor. We'll buy this again in a heartbeat if you do."
2,On Button broke in 1 hour,"After just 1 hour the on button stuck in the off position (probably from a little bit of sand from the sand table near it that the kids were also playing with)and there was pretty much no way to ""unstick"" it. What a pain after putting the whole thing together and getting the kids excited for their new toy!"
4,"We love ours, buying another one","I got this for my second daughter when she was 1, she's now turning 3 and still loves to play with it. We put coloring in the water and sometimes soap to add even more fun. I'm ordering another one today and was shocked to see the reviews. Ours works fine and the only reason I'm ordering another one is because my husband did not store it properly. I hope it works just as well."
4,Could have been better designed,"We bought this toy for our six year old autistic son who loves playing in water. As soon as we set it up, he was entranced--loved the water flowing, loved the floating toys, loved the button to turn it off and on. But within a short time, the water flow diminished considerably. We realized this was because the pump was getting clogged with dirt and grass (it was set up in our backyard). A $1 aquarium dip net solved the problem--why Step 2 didn't include a filter or screen in the design is a mystery!"
1,Very disappointed!,I purchased this for my son's second birthday because he loves the water & playing outside. The pump burned out in the first week. I called Step 2 and they were gracious enough to send a replacement pump. That lasted only 2 days. The thing is poorly made and a huge waste of money. It ended up in the trash within a month. It might actually be fun if it worked for more than a few minutes at a time.
1,Pump - what pump?,At most the pump gets out a trickle of water. In no way does it make the wheel spin as defined in the specs. We'd send it back if I could find the time to disassemble it or find a big enough box.
4,But it was great on those really hot days.,"Ok. My daughter got this July 2007 for her second bday. On those days when it was just too hot and too humid to let a child play outside, this small water toy was wonderful on the porch in the hot shade. We put on her bathing suit and she had a BLAST!! She loved to make the little characters race down the slide. It did last for about 2 months and I think the pump burnt out. Give a 2 year old the freedom to play with water and I guess a dixie cup would be just as exciting but this toy served it's purpose while it lasted. If you can find a deal on it, I say go for it."
2,too much of the same thing,The 5 disks are pretty much all the same until you come to the last few minutes where they are more specifically directed towards different focuses.I didn't really feel they were worth the investment
4,Still got a pocket full of stones,"UGK just like the geto boys helped to form hip hop in the south. Spittin for well over a decade the underground kingz are back with an impressive release. This double album has some good tracks and lyrics to entertain even a newcomer to the group. Filled with guest appearances that range from dope (kweli and big daddy kane) to wack as hell (rick ross) the album has something for everyone to enjoy. As with any double album you are going to find some garbageg that is on the album due to the number of songs on the cd. Roughly 85% of the album is dope though. My biggest complaint is some of the songs have repetitive subject matter, for example there are a couple of songs that are dedicated to their cars (chrome plated woman and candy). Some of the songs that have the same topic sound like the same song with a different beat. Other than that this album is a good release and worth buying."
2,Didn't leave up,I definitely wasn't impress with the c.d. Pimp c is waying down bun b. double cd which the songs starting sounding alike
2,bad review,The CD was recieved weeks late and sent in a regular manilla folder. Obviously the price of the postage and handling went into the senders pocket. The cover had multiple scratches and the hard plastic cover was warped. The CD itself was fine and played without problems.
2,Funky Monkey...,"This CD is straight-up unmixed, vocal, disco house. If that's your thing, then this is for you. I am a huge fan of Laurent's production work with his tracks ""Planar"" and ""Hear a Friend"", which are a little harder, tribal house. The tracks on ""Positiv Energy"" really weren't what was I was hoping for. The CD stays pretty funky throughout and the production really is impressive, but if you're a fan of Laurent's darker work, stay far away."
2,Not for Hartford Fans,"If you like John Hartford and his alt-country, folky, bluegrass, poppy sound but do not enjoy country rock, this album will be a disappointment. I do not know much about what the Dillards might have done before, but this album was a tough listen. Hartford barely has any songs and of the ones he does have, they fall into three categories: ok but not great, appear somewhere else in a better format, or are covers. If you like country rock, then I'm sure this will be fine, but Hartford fans beware; it's the Dillards' Show."
2,Blurry reticle,"I bought the Bushnell Tropy 1x28 from Amazon but had to return it. The reticle(s) were blurry. I tried every reticle, every brightness setting.. sort of like double vision. I cannot imagine how you could use it for aiming. Anyhow, returned it, got a replacement and found it was the same thing so that is going back as well."
1,not happy,"i dont see any advantage with this scope useless,will be sending it back.i buy alot of stuff off amazon.com .lets see how easy crap is to return. ed walsh"
2,I don't recommend it to anybody.,There is not much in this book. I expected to find details about firewalls and security. There are no details here. This book is not even for people who just want informative knowledge about firewalls.
3,A Little Disappointed,"I just received my towel bars and haven't had a chance to install them yet. But what I'm disappointed in is the color of the bars. In the pictures, they appear to be chrome. What arrived at my house is brass colored and very thin. The brackets however, are exactly as pictured and are very heavy, so I'm pleased with them. Time will tell how well the bars themselves hold up."
3,Second to some,"It was nice to get a revised and updated version of the Phantom manuscript. On the other hand, the store of Walter Scott, basically because of his untrusting nature, didn't quite get off the ground. If someone is really interested in a gripping tale of card sharps and magicians, I found Dai Vernon's search for the Kennedy Center Deal to be a much more exciting story: The Magician and the Cardsharp."
2,Bushnell Banner Dusk & Dawn 6-18x50 Riflescope,"I have two of the older Bushnell Banner Dusk & Dawn 3-9x40 Riflescopes , they feel and work Prefect , a lot better then the Bushnell Banner Dusk & Dawn 6-18x50 Riflescope I had received . I had Found it to feel Cheep , the adjustment rings on both ends felt like metal to metal , the cross hairs did not look right for a Long range scope for high magnification . I sent it Back , Very Disappointed with the scope , I felt it was over advertized . Not that Bushnell is a Bad Brand , But , the Scope I had received was not worth what I paid . I could have tried another one , but , then I would have had to wait for it to be returned and reshipped . no I just chose to return it .. Thank you Anyhow Bushnell !!"
1,Fake CD,"Ordered the John Hartford, ""Nobody Knows What You Do"" CD and received a disc with anonymous piano concertos on it!!! The packaging and print on the CD were correct; but there was NO John Hartford music on it!!! A worthless waste of money!!!!"
4,en mi conciencia esta la libertad,"Literatura especial para ser leida por adolescentes,ya que el autor se expresa de una forma muy amena y con un buen sentido del humor.Sobre el tema creo que hace una buena descripcion de los conceptos que van encadenados a lograr una buena manera de vivir, con alegria y con inteligencia y sobretodo con LIBERTAD.NO existe un codigo de etica, el cual debemos acatar, sino que la Etica, la hacemos nosotros mismos,con nuestras decisiones , con nuestras actitudes,con nuestros conocimientos y sobre todo con nuestra conciencia."
4,Great gift for any Eagles fan,"Bought this as a Christmas gift for a friend and he was clearly surprised and excited as soon as he realized what it was. Living in Texas it is impossible to buy anything football related that does not involve the Cowboys in anyway, so this was a great find."
2,router tables,"the item misrepresents itself by showing table top with fence. the package clearly states ""handle with care"" ""Fragile"", yet, the container was damaged severely, cabinet was damaged, and parts missing. I thought I was receiving a router table, not the cabinet alone. Large shipments are risky. I found out the hard way."
3,playable unplayable disc,The seller was great in responding to my problems real quick and it arrived promptly BUT---the disc is VERY temperamental seeing as it would pop make all sorts of noise in the disc drive then my players will say cannot read..after emailing the seller they just say to keep trying..and i did..and it finally worked! yay!
5,Beautifully written history,I have found this book incredibly informative and beautifully written. The complex tangle of Jesuit missionaries and shadey intelligencers requires a skilled narrative to keep from confusing the reader and Ms Hogge does this with a relaxed but authoritative style. I look forward to her next book.
5,"Ala puchis, super chilero y relindo","Creo que Gusi se excedio. Ya no aguanto, y cuando digo que ya no aguanto es porque quiero mas y mas y mas! Otro disco porfavor! Estoy seguro que sus papas deben estar orgullosos de el."
1,"Runs way too hot to use as a ""smoker""","I bought one of these summer 2005. This unit runs way too hot to use as a smoker (easily 250-300 degrees F). I even got a replacement regulator from the mfctr, but both ran too hot. I've had some success controlling temperature with valve on LP tank and a C clamp on the gas hose, but only limited luck. I've tried using an electric hot plate burner, but that only worked in warm weather and barely got above 200 degrees. Hate to say it, but would recommend you invest your money elsewhere."
3,Cooks too hot,This smoker has nice solid construction and ample smoking room considering the price however cooks too hot. The first time I used it was on a mild 45-50 degree day and on the lowest setting the tempurature reached about 300 degrees. Considering most smoking is done at about 200-250 it seems strange they wouldn't put a lower flow regulator on this product.
5,Smokin with the Pro's,"I have been wanting a smoker for a long time and have looked at several.I liked the looks of this unit and could not be happier with the results. I smoked baby back ribs and they were fabulous. I have used it three times and the results were the same fantastic. I talked my grandson into buying one, thats what I think of the smoker.It assembles easily and is quite attractive on my patio. I just purchased a cover to keep it protected from the sweltering Texas climate. R.F.O'Hara"
5,best propane smoker around !!!,"wanted a propane smoker and this little jewel fit the bill, in price, size, quality and workmanship !!!! With just the 2 of us we can smoke a complete meal all at once, meat and a potato and veggie and taste is out of this world....I don't see how you could go wrong with it and if you think you need more space I see that they have a larger one you can buy...the only improvement I can see is adding one more shelf ......"
4,Very cute,"Don't be fooled by the price, it's a great little table for the less than $30 it costs. My kid loves it."
4,Great camo design! Good scope!,"I have usually been a Redfield scope guy, and I cannot afford Leupold's, but this Bushnell Banner has been a good scope for me. Perfectly matching my camo on my gun and the Circle X plex. Worth the money!"
2,Unimpressive,"In one word, I'd describe the light put out by this bulb as ""blech""!On the plus side, it's nice and compact and should fit in any lamp.I've got 4 other brands of CF lights in my house and I have to say that this has been the worst of the bunch in terms of light. Lights of America and Satco both make bulbs with nice warm yellow/white light that somewhat resembles conventional lights. The Panasonic bulb has a noted white/purple tinge to it -- yuck!The *only* way this light would be minimally acceptable would be if it were the only light on in a room -- put it in a room with another lamp with a conventional light bulb and you'll see just how bad the light truly is.I bought two of these -- one a 15 watt the other a 20 watt. I ended up returning the 20 watt and am now sorry I didn't return the 15 watt too.To add insult to injury, the Satco bulbs I picked up from my local lighting store cost $4 -- this bulb was $12 until recently.Do yourself a favor and try another brand!"
3,something seems wrong,I purchased these for our condo complex. It's the exact same part number but for some reason the new bulbs are much much bluer than the old ones. I have no idea why but it is a very noticeable difference.
5,Capsule CFLs,"Great product, exceptional price, pretty rapid dlivery. What will I ever do when these are no longer available at discounted prices like this because the mfr's list price is totally outrageous."
3,broken chair within a few weeks,"This is a really nice table and chair set, but a chair's back broke off shortly after we received it. It looked like it would be repairable, but it has been determined now that it is a presswood product rather than real wood. It is possibly pressed cardboard. Just a little pressure and the back's material pulled off at the screw holes and it cannot be repaired. Unfortunately, due to pressing matters, I was unable to get the part repaired/replaced. Well, actually, the replacement period ended before the gift was even given to the child for her birthday! I'd love to hear from the manufactrer!"
5,Perfect table for my grandchildren,"Needed to purchase a table and chair set for grandchildren. After reading the reviews on so many sets I decided on this one. My daughter put it together in about an hour.We did however use wood glue in all the holes where the screws went after reading a few reviews that the chairs may become loose after a few weeks. We have had the set over a month and its very sturdy not to mention it is used by a 2,3, and 5 year olds several times a day. Would recommend this product."
5,Just what we were looking for.,"We purchased this set as a gift for our 18 month granddaughter. The chairs are strong enough so our son can sit with his daughter for a tea party and she is thrilled. I love the colors and more importantly, our granddaughter loves it and it is sturdy enough I'm not in fear we gave her something that will topple if she decides to stand on it.Great set at a great price. I couldn't give this anything less than 5 stars."
5,Perfect for young children!,My two year old granddaughter uses the set all the time for many activities. She loves it and it is such an attractive set!
5,Granddaughter loves it!!!,"We bought this table and chairs for our 1 year old granddaughter. This is the perfect height for her. It is very strudy and it took my husband minimal amount of time to put together. He said it went together rather easily, everything was color coded right down to the screws."
3,"Cute, but looks shabby fast","We have had this set for almost two years, it looks cute, and super cute out of the box, but as everyone has said, the paint chips horribly. I have had to tighten the screws a couple times because the chairs start to wobble. I wish they would have shipped some touch up paint with all of it, because I know I'm not the only one with this problem. However, with all that being said, my daughter LOVES this table and chairs, she still plays with it almost daily. We have gone through over 3 tea sets because of the constant use of this."
3,Soft Particle Board,"Made of a mix of real wood and particle board. The seat back, which is made of particle board, began to deform as soon as the fasteners are tightened, and it appears that several continue to dig into the soft material. Unfortunately too cheap for its own good, and I suspect it will not hold up. The thing looks great when put togther and our daughter could not care less about the manufacturing, so we are not entirely dissatisfied."
4,Cute table!,"We have had this for 2 years and my son (now 3) still loves it. It is super cute and looks nice in the playroom, dining room, or the living room, depending on what we need it for. I agree that the paint does chip a little off of the colored chairs -- but ours has been very minimal and actually expected, since it's a kid's item that gets daily wear and is 2 years old. I think it has held up extremely well and has many years left. Chairs are sturdy and don't tip over easily (a problem with many plastic sets).Also VERY easy to clean. I use a magic eraser and it gets EVERYTHING off of it -- no crayon, marker, paint stains. We love this and would purchase it again in a heartbeat."
4,Christimas was a success!!,"My 2 1/2 year old granddaughter loved the table and chair set. It is the first Christmas gift that she went for!! Her father, my son had no problems with assembly, and everything was numbered and easy to follow. The only thing that I was a little disappointed with is that there were no screw caps/dollies which did take a little bit away from the looks of the chairs as they stuck out in the backs of all of the chairs.. Otherwise, for the money, it was made very well and seems to be very sturdy."
3,Appropriately priced,"The set looks really sweet and is just the right size, maybe a little big, for my very tall almost two year old. The chairs are sturdy (we've been sitting on them) and it wipes clean super easy.Within two weeks there were two spots where I don't know what happened.. but I think really good furniture shouldn't get damaged that quickly. Overall, it's cheaply made, and you can tell... But it works, and we're keeping it... can't afford pottery barn kids like I wish ;)"
4,"Amazing, but more assembly","I love this, kidkraft stuff is great. My daughter is 20 months old, we have tea parties, while it seems ok, all the adults have sat on these little chairs, they seem stable enough. However assembly while simple took me awhile. They never pre-assembly any piece! Which is why all of their products come in the tiniest heaviest boxes. All the assembly is easy and clear. The product looks great and it's very sturdy. I do not feel nervous about having this in my daughter's room without supervison (i.e. sleeping at night). Great quality, very happy."
2,Expect terrible customer service and no item,Horrible customer service!! Take forever to get your item if at all. Agents there pass your aruond and never give you a correct answer as well lie to get rid of you.
3,Disappointing,"We were all in love with this table and chairs set. At first it was simply beautiful. After a few months of use it began to chip and fall apart. 3 of the 4 chair backs are broken within 8 months or less. If a drip of water is not immediately wiped up from the table, the paint will bubble up (making the table look deformed). Sad really. It really is beautiful when you put it together, but the quality is rather poor."
4,KidKraft Nantucket Table & 4 Pastel Chairs,"This table set is super cute but the paint starting to chip and our washable markers (which wash of everything thus far) do not wash off this table set. All being said, we did not return it and it still serves it's purpose. Overall we liked this product despite the flaws, and our 20 month daughter loves siting at a 'big girl table'"
3,"Not as great as we thought, but still ok for the price.","Well after 6 months we are writing to say that we adore this little set. It is much better than the metal and cardboard chair set we had, although that one lasted almost 2 years. This little set is cute as can be. But we had to put a plastic cover over the top to keep the top protected to keep the paint from scratching. My daughter fell backwards on one of the chairs and the back support of the chair splintered - the chair backing is only very cheap press board. It was easy to put together. We still love the set, but are finding that it is not all that sturdy.Customer service is great, they have responded to our need for parts."
4,Good Product,"My kids love the table. It is sturdy and well built, which is why I rated it so high. The table space is a little lacking, it is about 20-22"" square table top. The latter is my only gripe about the product.It was simple and easy to assembly and I was impressed with how well packed it was, heavy foam.Overall a good product in my opinion.."
5,grandbabies table set,I was very pleased with the apperance and construction of this childrens table and chair set. I hope my 2 grandbabies will enjoy this for years to come.
1,crap,crap it i bought one for my little girls it did not even last a year it fell a part the chairs broke so fast and the screw under table keep falling out.
4,"Pretty product, good cust svc, some assembly problems","Great price for aesthetics, size and amount of chairs. Easy enough to assemble if you have any experience with ikea. Came up short one required screw, called cuts svc and they promised to send a replacement, so that was highly positive. Aggravated that when putting together one of the chairs, had the wood split a little, makes the back of that chair look ugly. Otherwise, love the product, and hoping to get lots of use. Will update in a few months to report on durability.Fyi re: height- bought this for my 15 mos old, who is at 75th perc for height. The chairs are too tall for her to easily get on to, she has to sort of climb up. She can still at it and eat, play, etc. I think a somewhat shorter chair set would have been wiser for her age. But, I'm sure by the time she is 2 it will be perfect, and hopefully then she will get a few more years out of it."
1,Disappointed - I wanted a real Hebrew-English dictionary,"I wanted a Hebrew-English/English Hebrew dictionary where the Hebrew words were in Hebrew. This English transliteration dictionary is of no use to me, because I correspond and receive e-mail in Hebrew. I am better off using Mozilla Firefox's add-on, ""ImTranslator."""
3,"Many mangled entries, lack of Hebrew writing","The dictionary is basically a list of words with a one or two-word translation following. Sometimes they give multiple translations into Hebrew but fail to explain what the difference is or why I should choose one over the others.For the Hebrew/English half they have placed some of the Hebrew words actually inside part of the English words. Very weird.They're also inconsistent with their romanization of Hebrew--words which appear in both halves are sometimes spelled differently. (""memory"" is one example of this; it appears as zi'karon in the English-to-Hebrew side, but is found as ""zeekaron"" in the Hebrew-to-English side. Oh, and ""memory"" is found after ""remember"" in the English-to-Hebrew side.)Finally, there's no table of contents; you have to guess where the words under a particular letter are going to be.It's not horrible, but it could be greatly improved with some editing."
1,Bunk and Junk,""" Super high Grade "" ?? Playback on 3 different machines and the tapes broke.I tried the last tape in a new recorder - same problem.This forced me to go Digital!"
4,Good buy,Good buy for online. Try to package with other items to avoid freight. On small items the freight eliminates any savings the lower online price. But it is convenient.
2,Empty calories,"When my book club picked ""Got To Be Real"" recently, I was looking forward to a breezy but smart summer read. Unfortunately, much of the book is pretty cheesy and mediocre. I really wanted to like this collection, if only to support the guys who are adding their voices to the contemporary fiction genre. The best thing the book has going for it is the team of Eric Jerome Dickey and Colin Channer. While their stories were a little tedious, they at least attempted something different than the typical brothers-in-love stuff. Beyond lots of steamy scenes, E. Lynn Harris' contribution is thin. I was particularly turned off by Marcus Major's story about the evolution of a troubled relationship. I had a hard time believing that anyone would find the shallow male character appealing, and the dialogue isn't exactly whip-smart. If you must read this book, check it out from a library and save your money."
4,Got to be reading this,"Got to be real is a collection of four sweet short stories by a bunch of excellent writers who tell it like it is, no matter what they've got going on. My personal favorite, Colin Channer's I'm Stil Waiting had me in stitches when describing a certain lady, Mia. You should check the fattage out for yourself."
3,NOT REALLY REAL,"WELL I WOUL DSAY THAT THIS BOOK LEFT A LITTLE SOMETHING TO BE DESIRED. THE STORIES NEED TO BE STRETCHED OUT INTO FULL NOVELS, THEY SEEMS TO BE NOVEL THAT WERE CHOPPED UP.THREE STORIES WERE GOOD."
2,Disappointed...,"I love Eric J. Dickey but it appeard he did not put much into this story. E. Lynn Harris I've not been able to get into his literature. ( a personal thing)Marcus Major story was alright, the only story that I really got into was Colin Channer. I did enjoy his story and the message from his story. Sorry guys, expected more, but I won't give up on ya..."
4,Marcus....,"As an avid reader, I was excited to learn about this book. However, it was someone whose writing that I was not familiar with that captured my heart, and that was Marcus Major. I loved his writing style, it just flowed effortlessly.Kenya and Amir's story is the everyman story. We have all been there, and can relate to them on some level. However it was Amir and the boys at the barbershop that made me realize the thinking that goes on in the brain of the man! Amir's mother was also a gem!So while I enjoyed the other novellas as well, I will have to give my thumbs up to Marcus', whose earlier works I will be eagerly seeking out."
4,"From the 1st story to the last,you won't put this one down!","For readers of contemporary African American fiction, Got To Be Real is definitely a must-read. With the exception of a few typos, the stories are well written and each one of them will move you to want more from these authors, particularly Marcus Major and E.Lynn Harris. For anyone who's played and paid in love, Major's Kenya and Amir will take you on a rollercoaster of emotions that will make you think twice before you stick that hand in the bushes again. His story is tight, beautiful and yet deeply emotional. Harris' Money Can't Buy Me Love is E.Lynn at his absolute best! Anyone with a dry eye after reading either of these two stories needs to get their heartrate checked ASAP!"
3,Pleasantly Surprised!,"I'm not a big fan of short stories but I thought I'd read the book because of the authors who wrote it. I was pleasantly surprised by the authors ability to pull off writing short stories on love/relationships. EJ Dickey's novella was quite different from what I am used to but it was a great story all the same. M. Majors was one of my favorites as it had a certain depth and flare to it that really captivated me and made it an enjoyable read. E. Lynn Harris' story reminds you of some of his original writing and gives you very hot degrees of love. True E. Lynn fans will love it! As for C. Channer, his novella speaks for itself.If you enjoy short stories about love, you're likely to thoroughly enjoy this book."
4,Love stories among great authors,"Got to Be Real was a collection of love stories that I enjoyed reading by some great authors !While Eric and E.Lynn are proven to be great authors. Marcus was not left alone ! I am not sure what to think about Colin's story ! I tried on two different times to finish it with out luck ! This is one reason it has taken me so long to post on this novel ! I am not sure, maybe I should have read Waitin in Vain first to understand Still Waiting ! However I will rate Eric 's story as 4*E.Lynn 's story 4.5 and Marcus story was truly a 5* read ! Kudoos to you Marcus and please keep the good job up ! I can't help but wonder what happen to me with Colin's story ! Was it only me that had a problem with his story ? I will have to pull Waiting in Vain out of my tbr pile to see if it makes a difference.What a great book to have released on my birthday !"
2,Not the best,"The consensus is of the reviewers is correct....EJD? This wasn't his best work. As a matter of fact, I think it was his worst. Major? He hit it out of the park with the Amir and Kenya storyline. EXCELLENT!!! Harris? His story was fair. Colin? Stopped reading after about 20 pages. I couldn't grasp what was going on and the storyline was all over the place....Just awful!"
4,Playing the game of love on an uneven field.,"Starting with my grading scale of 5 stars are the stories by E. Lynn Harris and Marcus Major. Both included major characters with lots of personality and strong stories. Both should have been complete novels, because they ended too soon. The Eric Jerome Dickey story earned 4 stars because the major players were interesting, yet the romance seemed forced. The search for the embezzler had my attention, and his comuppance at the end was well deserved. The Colin Channer story was a 2. The story was very deep. Too deep. There can't be a nuclear warhead anywhere buried as deep as this story. Too much description of everything surrounding Patience, Michael, and Mia, and the endless flashbacks (some interesting) made for a very long short story. All in all, there is something for everyone."
3,Let's Be Real!!,"I had to give this book only three stars because it wasn't really what I expected. I don't really like ERIC JEROME DICKEY'S writing but I thought he did a good job with this one. I have to say that it was a little slow at first but it picked up and turned out to be pretty good. The stories by E. LYNN HARRIS and MARCUS MAJOR were absolute page turners! I didn't want them to end!!! On the other hand, it took me forever to read COLIN CHANNER'S story! It wasn't my idea of a love story and it was poorly written."
1,"???Lost, Confused, Bored???",This book was not real at all and did not leave me wanting more. I was really dissapointed in Eric Jerome Dickey's part of the story because it seemed to not have a real plot or theme. E. Lynn Harris was cool bt he seemed to move a bit slower than usual.The worst story ever written in the United States would have to be the one by Colin Channer. GOODNESS!! I tried so many times to read his last irrelevant story but i couldn't because i fell asleep due to BOREDOM. My favorite story was by Marcus Major. This was in fact a REAL story. It shows just how much bull a black woman will take from a man that she loves. All in all- please don't waste your time.
4,No Love Lost,"This is one of the most captivating books I have ever read. After I received this book as a present, I simply could not put it down. Each author explored the trials and tribulations of love and how one can gain or lose love. The only other book that I have previously read was If This World Were Mine E. Lynn Harris. I simply have to give it up for these four brothers, not for just keeping it real, but for giving so much depth to what many consider a simple subject. I'm going to read each solo project that I can get my hands on."
2,Great Authors Low Rate Stories,These are four of the best authors that I have read but these stories were not their best. The stories were okay but because they were short they did not have time to develop.
2,2 of the 4 stories should n BEDTIME stories,Eric and Colin need 2 pack it up and try again. Their stories are the first and last of the book and i c y cause if u were 2 read e. lynn and marcus first u would automatically close the book after reading. they r so SO boring. E lynn and Marcus u both that 5 stars each. very gritty stories tht keeps you reading.COLIN and ERIC after milk in my coffee i no longer read his books i am very turned off and colin i will never read n e thing of his againPRAISE for E LYNN HARRIS and MARCUS MAJOR
2,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed with this book. The stories by E. Lynn Harris and Marcus Major were very good stories. But I was bored with the stories by Eric Jerome Dickey and Colin Channer. I have always been a fan of Dickey's books; his other books have been so easy to read. However, in this book, I never could get into the story. The story was slow from beginning to end. I found the story by Channer to be boring also. I wouldn't recommend anyone buying this book. Check it out of the library, borrow it from a friend, but don't purchase it."
3,"Dark, Gritty, Edgy, Real","I'm not sure how I feel about Got To Be Real. Dickey and Harris are the only two authors whose work I've read and immensely enjoyed in the past. The only adjectives that come to mind when I think of these stories are dark, gritty, edgy, but real. You can't help but feel compassion for the characters portrayed in each of these novellas; each story was a good fit for this particular anthology. I didn't put this book down feeling exactly good about it, but I did get another brief glimpse into the visceral nature of human being when the thin veneer of relational civility is peeled away to reveal the deeper, darker more complex psyches of both men and women."
2,Read it to Sleep,I think this book gets hype because of the four authors and not the actual stories they wrote. I forced myself to read most of this book only because I made the mistake of buying it. It didn't move me at all. I give it 2 stars - one star for each of the TWO stories worth reading. Try reading this book when you're suffering from insomnia. I guarantee you'll be out in no time.
4,"4 Men, 4 Real Stories of Love","Cafe Piel-EJD, Too short but a very nice and touching story. Nothing can explain the twisted story, you have to read it for yourself. The story of Bobby & Alejandria will have you begging for more. Amir & Kenya-MM, If you had the opportunity to read ""Good Peoples"" you will find out how it all started for Amir & Kenya. Myles also makes a short appearance. From reading this you get the idea that MM knows these people very well. If you haven't read ""Good Peoples"" BUY IT. Money Can't Buy Love-ELH, Honest is all I can really say. This often painful and touching story will have you in tears. It is a bit graphic but my eyes never left the page. I'm Still Waiting-CC, Sweet, sexy and very descriptive. I wanted to digest every word, the writing makes your mind wonder to the places he has described. In general I LOVED this book, do yourself a favor and GET IT NOW."
1,Not Real!,"This was a book club recommendation, which left me wanting to read a ""real"" book. I was not impressed with any of the stories. The first one left me stumped! I am still trying to understand what the author was trying to get across to his audience. What was the theme? As to the second story, I am waiting for the ending. How long will this man sit in the stairwell - I know it is fiction, but can we have a dose of reality here. The third story is typical E.Lynn Harris, one of my favorite authors. However, he lost some of his fervor in writing this story. It did not have the substance found in his other novels. The last story is simply the worst. It was tedious and painful to read. Too detailed, nothing left to the immagination, too many quotes from Bob Marley's songs, too much of everything."
4,Colin Channer- I'm still Waiting,"I really enjoyed all the authors contributions, however Colin Channer effort, really struck some cords with me. He writes with such emotion and passion. His knowlege of the history of reggae music is also very attractive. I am now on the hunt for more of his work."
4,Great Idea,"These gentlemen are the hottest writers around right now and publishing an anthology featuring them all was a fantastic idea. Marcus Major is a young new talent and I'm sure we're going to get a whole lot more from him. I fell in love with Colin Channer's writing with ""Waiting in Vain"" which I hope won't happen for his next book. Lynn and Eric know exactly which buttons to push to keep the readers hooked. Keep those books coming gentlemen, your public awaits."
2,Over rated,I didn't like this book very much. I like the writers but I got to say this is by far was the worst of all the writers talents. Don't by this book. The best choice is to get at the library
3,"Not all bad, but not all good either","This book is chocked full of talented writers, however, they're not all living up to to their talent and name. Yup, I was disappointed. I found the saving grace of this collection to be Colin Channer's piece - not surprising that it was the longest and last piece - anchoring the book. Channer again, exposes Jamaica's multi-culture roots with sincerity and honesty. Channer's writing is detailed and poetic. His characters are fleshed out, understndable, and accesible. Once you've read the story you feel like you've read a much longer piece - that's how concise Channer's story telling is. Personally, I want to know what happens next. Colin Channer is the substance in this book of flash."
4,A wonderful book!,"Gooden offers a wonderful look into Shakespeare's time. I was delighted that The Bard is a secondary character rather than the investigator, and that one does not need a great knowledge of Shakespeare or his plays to enjoy the book. It is a classic mystery with clues and suspense along the way. I loved the character of Nick Revill and didn't feel hampered by having started the series late into it. This was the first I've read in this series, but have already ordered all the others."
1,Didn't work - old school,Don't waste you money on this software. Several of the games didn't work properly and my son lost interest after an hour.
4,where to find the rest of the series...,"Try looking on the Harvard Univ. Press website, under LOEB.(www hup harvard edu / loeb)"
5,Nice,"I was looking for a fine comb with a wide handle and this was the only one I found. All the other ones were either fine with a long pointy handle or just a medium size comb, I have had it for a year and works just fine."
4,"it's fun, not to hard on the body and i feel great afterward","jennie garth does a good job with her introduction about how movie stars work to keep in shape. the exercise portion is complete with an easy warm-up, a fun, low-impact workout, as well as a lower body toning session. I feel great when i'm done working out, but i don't feel tired or sore. all in all, it's my favorite workout video!"
2,aromatherapy for epilepsy??!!,"Starts off informatively enough with chapter on 'what is epilepsy?' but after considering conventional treatment, starts to look at therapies such as flower remedy, yoga etc. As a sufferer myself (resigned after 35 yrs to a lifetime of tablets) I wouldnt want any newly diagnosed person to think there's much likelihood of their getting fixed via some nice natural treatment. Dont mean to be negative but it's just not that kind of illness"
5,Read this book!,"The only reason I bought this book was I was flipping tv channels and saw Tim Russert from NBC interviewing John Hockenberry. Russert seemed so taken by what Hockenberry said in his book, I wanted to read it. This is a philosophy book disguised as an autobiography. So well written and thought-provoking I tried to drag out reading the last few chapters just to make it last longer. I will never look at someone in a wheelchair the same way again"
5,"Excellent -- funny, insightful,","I read this book when it first came out, and found it funny and honest, gritty and enlightening. The author is an amazing talent -- a talent that seems to have no bounds.I have no personal experience with spinal cord injuries (knock wood), but came away from reading this book with a deep appreciation for the challenges facing people with them. The book made it abundantly clear that you simply cannot categorize people by their injuries or disabilities. Mr. Hockenberry is a great talent who happens to be a paralyzed from the waist down, not the other way around.I still miss him on NPR."
2,Unnecessarily wordy,"This book is definitely not designed with a novice in mind. I felt that some concepts and explanations went round and round, never really explaining what was meant. It made for difficult reading. Unfortunately, i had to use this book for class, but i can say that at least 1/2 the class felt similarly about the book. I wouldn't buy it unless you had to. Plenty of other books out there with quality code examples to grasp the concepts better."
2,Too simplistic and too many errors,There were many errors throughout the book. Some of the chapters barely mention the topic ... you spend time reading it and the only useful bits are in the summary. I forced myself to read about 75% of this book and still hadn't gotten anything useful from it.
2,Not terribly concise,"I'm an embedded C programming and was interested in broadening my design skills to encompass more object oriented concepts. As such, I thought this book would be a great resource. It really wasn't. The useful information could have been boiled down to a couple chapters and the rest is mainly repetitive and common sense. I suppose this book would be helpful to someone who has never thought of software design before."
4,Good book for beginners,"For anyone unfamiliar with the OO paradigm, I think this book is an excellent choice. The explanation of basic concepts is clear and concise, and the examples given are useful. For readers who have spent any time at all around OO, however, I would choose a different book because this one may not add much to your understanding."
5,Objects are cool!,"I've had this book at home for many years (1st ed.) and I recently picked it up and read it. It is a very good working introduction to OOP. It's relatively easy to read, not dull, provides good examples of the ideas, uses a little java (which you don't need to be an expert on. I'm mostly a SAS programmer), and it covers some UML. I will certainly try to keep these concepts in mind when I later attempt to create a web application programmed with PHP."
1,OO for Nitwits,"Save your money and find a free online tutorial. If you eliminated all the repetition, and references to other books, this book would be about the length of a magazine article. This book is completely disorganized. Also, it sprinkles advance OO jargon around, such as ""granularity"", without explaining it, which is worse than not mentioning it at all.You know the expression, ""a little knowledge is a dangerous thing""? Well then you will extremely dangerous after reading this book, because for the price, you will have gotten extremely little knowledge."
5,This book clears thoughts about Object Oriented Design,"It is an excellent book for a programmer to begin Object Oriented programming. It is even better for a person who has done some amount of Object oriented design, analysis and programming. Overall it is a wonderful book."
1,Steer clear of this book,"If you loved ""Attack of the Killer Tomatoes"" you'll love this book. If you want to learn about OO technologies pick up some other book (*any* other book).When you read the book it feels like it was written overnight, and neither the author nor the technical editors had time to read the book. The text is full of typos (no spell checker?), and code samples speak for themselves: they are one-liners at best, and if there are more than one line author loses the reader completely.After a couple of chapters of this torture the next chapter turns into a bad book review, where the author starts referring to other books by their page numbers. Then the book becomes a quick Java tutorial, and then a UML tutorial, and everthing else tutorial without a single complete thought.The publisher (Sams) is good, the title is great, the contents page is good, but replace the author and the text."
1,**No unique valuable info. All common sense stuff.**,"I felt like this whole book could be condensed down into about 40 pages of useful material, but they needed to justify the price with a thicker book.For those with even a basic understanding of OO principles, this book will be a painfully slow read. If you see it in a bookstore, just scan the Notes, Tips, and Cautions (marked by small vertical grey rectangles) and ignore the rest.If you are new to programming, and coming from a completely different field, it ""might"" be worth a read."
2,Uh Oh !!,"1.The whole book could have been written in 20-30 pages. Really!2. Now if you dont know anything about OOP, I think books that to explain concepts through ballons which have properties (red/blue/plastic) states(IsBlown) methods(BallonFly,BallonMakeNoise) events(OnBallonNail,OnBallonTouch) and other ""abstract"" manners DO HARM the reader. The beginner is left with a big ?, bigger than if he wouldn't red anything about OOP.3. On the other hand if you know OOP the hard way, by experience through languages, this book HAS NOTHING TO OFFER, except maybe one ot two refreshing concepts."
2,Static attributes and methods not available to objects not of the class!!??,"Decided to have a look at this book to see if it's fit for some colleagues who are unfamiliar with OO.I'm up to chapter 6 of this book and so far it's not a bad introduction to OO concepts, but in chapter 5 under ""Keeping the scope as small as possible"" it states -""Static attributes and methods are shared among objects of the same class; however, they are not available to objects not of the class""Err, sorry - FAIL!What absolute hogwash. public static members of a class can be accessed from anywhere, including from objects not of the class. This is a fundamentally wrong statement. Unless I'm reading it wrong?"
5,"This is a ""Must Read"" book for learning object oriented programming",After reading this book I am comfortable in OOP technology and am on to more in-depth learning of OOP methodologies and implementations. I recommend this book to all who are new to OOP or are trying to advance their career from procedural programming to OOP programming. I've been involved with computers since 1967 and this book cleared away the mystery of the OOP terms and techniques.
4,importance of understanding the concept behind,"This book is great for those looking to brush up on fundamental concepts behind Object Oriented Programming and for those with a procedural programming background looking to get in and get started with OO coding.This book gives solid examples that can be easily understood . If you are anything like me you will want to know the 'rhyme and reason' for doing something a particular way rather than just doing it. This book gives you the know-how to start thinking about when, why and how things should be done. A solid starting point for anyone looking to start on the basics then move forward to more complex stuff confidently."
4,"It's great, but will my lab accidentally kill me?","I just bought this for my 95-pound lab. I wanted to have something that would work for those days when I get home from work a bit later, allowing both of us to get our workout. Up till now it's been too much weekend warrior for me, as I feel the dog needs to get a good workout when I get home.No instructions with the leash, though I did find a rudimentary drawing with sequentially-numbered labels online. I took it to the local bike shop to sort out how to put it on. They did so and wouldn't let me pay for the service.I've only used the leash yesterday and today so far. It is very sturdy, as one of the other reviewers noted, and also pretty unobtrusive, protruding only a few inches at the rear of the bike. When not in use, the leash clip (dog end) can be hung over the bike lever that allows for wheel removal.I'm proud of my dog and the way he's behaved to date, just leary of what will happen to me when he sees the first cat."
3,accident to avoid,I had an accident last week while biking with my dog. My 1yr old female lab saw a bird and run after it. I lost control and fell off the bike. There was a broken tooth and stitches on my face. Accident happends so easily. Be careful when you decide to bike with your dog. This leash does not have any elastisity to reduce the impact.
4,Prelimanary Review,"Usage: Trek Series 5 Alpha Aluminum, installed and not yet used.Pros: Straight forward installation; simple, universal DesignCons: Does not work with wheels that have seperate brake hubs.Notes: None... YetRecommendation for Consumer: Be aware of needing to buy a longer rear skewer for your bike. For bikes with seperate brake rotors, you will need to unbend the tube a little.Recommendation for manufacturer: make the bend in the pipe subtle over a longer distance to make the device compatable with seperate brakes rotors and the moment arm longer against the frame."
1,Doesn't fit our bikes but for the best - it doesn't seem adequate,The product doesn't fit our bike but from looking at it and seeing how it attaches I don't believe I would have ever felt comfortable walking my Huskies with it. They are strong pullers and it just doesn't seem like the bike would survive it or for that matter me. Ended up buying a Walkie Dog -amazing little product.
2,Pyramid Bicycle Dog Leash,"The Pyramid Bicycle Dog Leash is attractive to the eye, BUT, many bicycles today are very light. I have a carbon fiber bicycle and the Pyramid Bicycle Dog Leash is made of a very HEAVY material. Using this leash is completely contrary to the whole idea of having a light weight riding situation and walking/running your dog alongside your bicycle. I am mystified that the manufacturers would use such a heavy metal when making this leash. Of course I know the answer. It is much CHEAPER to make the leash out of CHEAP heavy metal than to use a more EXPENSIVE light weight metal. I cannot recommend this leash to anyone. It must be re-manufactured to a much lighter weight. I view this as a wasted purchase. I do not use the leash due to it's excessive weight."
3,Works well with STANDARD frame bicycles,"The product is a good idea and is built very well. The construction is very beefy and welds are solid. There is one thing I would strongly caution individuals considering this product, however. It does not fit well on frames of bicycles that do not have a ""standard"" design. In other words, if the lower frame support from the pedals to the rear tire is not straight, you will have an issue. My bicycle has bends in the frame in that area. I tried to ""make it work"", but halfway through the ride with my dog, he darted to one side and ripped the back wheel out of the frame."
1,Bent wheel frame blues,"I love and hate this product. Have used it to take my Rhodesian ridgeback on a 20 mile bike ride down the street through the city of Dallas. Works great. However if you take this down a paved path where there are squirrels or critters, you are doomed. The design allows the dog to run behind the bike and if he wants to run on the right side the length of the attachment allows it. If you dog is a puller, he can tweek the bracket around so that it can bend the wheel frame. If you can keep your dog on the left side it works awesome."
3,You can create the same exercise experience with a waist leash,"If you have trained your dog with commands, all you need is a six-foot lead (this a normal length training leash) that clips around your waist (often called a ""Hands Free"" or ""Runner's Leash"") to give your dog a great run. I am a huge believer in ample exercise for dogs. We live in a condo and exercise makes all the difference in obedience, health and boredom level for our 40 lb. dog. We started out with one of these bike contraptions, but it was expensive and a pain to take off when I wanted to just ride the bike on my own."
2,Unsure,I liked the product and it seems just as good as more expensive ones. I used it with my older dog with no problems. I put a younger dog on it. We live in the country and he pulled me down the road about 20 mph. We stopped because a car was comming up behind us. After the car passed we I was walking the bike into a turn. The dog got anxious and was jerking as I was turning. He pulled the pyramid out of the bike. He stopped when I called him so no harm there. They pyramid was not harmed. My bike got bent up real bad where the pyramid fit and the gear guide. It was a 10 speed. I through the bike away. It would have cost more to fix than replace.
1,Doesn't fit correctly n never used,"Don't buy this junk it isn't what you want. Very disapointed n I bought two. Doesn't fit the bikes even with retro fitting, it only damaged the breaks."
1,So close and yet so far,"I am a die-hard Tom Hanks fan so any book about him and his awesome career belongs in my library. This is a good one, but there are some serious downfalls in it. I am not sure if the authors are just overly impossibly critical or what, but they refuses to see the good side of his work in the early days. I was depressing. If you know anything about actors you know that they are not all overnight success. Why can't they deal with that? I was able to forgive them this type of criticism until I read about Sleepless in Seattle. Where was the editor the day these pages came in? Sam Baldwin's sons name is Jonah, not Joshua!"
1,TIMEX #T5C711 REVIEW,"My Husband bought this watch and when we got it,it looks like a little kids watch. It said men's and it appeared to be a bigger watch than what it really is. We were very disappointed."
4,Nice scope mounts not so much.,"All in all the scope is nice, but the aluminum mounts were to weak for my shotgun. I had to buy a pair of steal mounts. Not a big deal as I was planning on buying shorter mounts anyways. I would buy again and recommend this to a friend."
5,Being Jordan Book,I'm so excited that I got this book through your service! This book is only available in the UK!!! Excellent condition paperback book with lot's of pictures! Her story is amazing. I just love her! Thank you for having it in stock!!!
3,Being Jordan,"I have enjoyed the book. It has been very inspiring about the modelling jobs Jordan has done and the experiences she has had so far in her life. Most of the book is about her love life and jobs (modelling), but some parts are about her family etc. I think the stories carry on a little about her love life because there are stories about all of her boyfriends. It is an interesting book but i feel it has been written too soon in her life as she is only in her twenties. Hopefully when she is alot older, she will write another autobiography which is not all about her boyfriends. The pictures are interesting and give people the ideas of her experiences and pictures of her boyfriends.I recommend to young women and people who think different of Katie Price that needs to know whta she has been through to get how far she is now in life."
5,An outstanding Historical study of Japan's Nuclear efforts!,"Robert Wilcox has documented the final answer to those who might suggest that the US had some racist motive to drop two atomic bombs on Japan. They, in fact, planned to drop one on us! Yoshio Nishina, one of the world's formost nuclear scientists, had a major operation underway to develop nuclear weapons for WW-II Japan. It is only now that we have the declassified files, can we disclose this information. My hat is off to Robert for this outstanding book. REQUIRED READING IF YOU WANT THE TRUTH.Robert A. Clark President Internation Association of Military Technology Historians"
5,A Classic in The Industry,"Syncopation is a classic in the drumming world. What is great about it is it goes through quarter notes, 8th notes, syncopation, 16th notes, 8ths with 16ths, triplets, accents, etc, and it does so in a way where the student can repeat the rhythm in a section, then move on to the next similar (but slightly different) one, then play a page where it combines the variations.It is great for learning how to read and how to play popular rhythms.Many instructors have devised numerous additional ways a student can go through the book as well (e.g., left hand plays the page/rhythms while the right hand plays an ostinato pattern)."
3,It's good.,"I thought that this book was a bit more of a beginners book. That isn't quite the case. It doesn't really teach you about the different notes. The sheet music is also hard to read, I'm surprised that this book hasn't been made over to be more easy to read. I'll post another review once I can actually use this book. Once I get a good grasp on notes and everything."
5,Awesome!,This is a greet book and was shipped super quick! Perfect condition! If there is a book you need to buy it is this one! Thanks!
4,Great Book,"If you're a beginner and just learning how to read music (for drums) this is a great book. It is good to have a teacher go through this book with you, and maybe add in some things... it is always good and very helpful to count out loud while going through this book. The book is only snare + bass, and starts with quarters, then goes on to eights, sixteenths, triplets, and even sixteenth-note triplets. It also has a few rolls, and in the end it teaches you accents."
4,A tried and true introduction especially if you know Latin,"I have used this book a number of times with students who wanted to learn Greek. It's not really suitable for a self-taught course, but it has features that make it handy for those who have some Latin under their belts. The approach is indeed old-fashioned, and I don't know that there are any answer keys. The aim of the book is toward Xenophon just as older Latin books were headed toward Caesar, very old-school British. The vocabulary has that military flavor to some extent, but a girl whom I have taught recently was very excited about reading four axioms of Euclid and then announced it to her Math teacher."
5,Answer key,"Like everyone else on here, I used this text back at UNC in an intensive course. As we went through the text, with a great instructor, Dr. West, I was careful to use a notebook to record all the correct answers to the exercises. In other words, I made my own answer key. I have searched high and low for it but cannot find it. I am a pack rat but I have the feeling it is gone. I would also enjoy a collaborative effort to create an answer key for this book. Any takers?Robert"
3,It's Ok,A fairly average novel as far as BSCs go.Mary ANne and Dawn are mothers-helpers again and there's lots of boys and flirting.You know.
2,These hurt!!!,I got these as an accessory to a Halloween costume. they matched great but they pinched my ears really bad. I would not recommend buying these unless you have tough ears.
1,Disorganised,I kept reading in case it got better - it didn't. The author keeps repeating himself and making what he judges to be funny sideline comments about what he has just written.His jokes are not even funny. He keeps telling us he thinks he is a pretty good author - he is probably the worst I have ever read since I stopped marking Intermediate School essays. The narrative keeps jumping around and the repetition becomes thoroughly annoying. The best part was actually at the end when he was no longer trying to be funny - it was an article that he had contributed to a magazine. I'm glad I only paid Kindle price and can now delete it.
4,A great book to learn to orchestrate.,"I borrowed this book from a library but it came without CD. I read it and I liked it. Finally, I decided to buy it. It's worth my money. It shows how to get a certain sound with the instrumentation. One thing is I like Mancini's music so the book is good for me."
2,Rather keep your Money !,"By comparison with books more recent, that is not very fascinating, safe for fan of Mancinni!!There is almost nothing on voicings. . Some information to be gleaned anyway (orchestral colors mixture of instrument, general and personnal procedures and expérience ) see rather Don Sebky or Sam Nestico books ! The CD returns the attractive journey. Not indispensable! you should rather keep your Money !For a real book on the practical subject see rather Ken Pullig ' ""Arranging for Large Jazz Ensemble"" or ""Inside the score"" or, for historical analysis ""Changes Over Time: The Evolution of Jazz Arranging"" that are real material !"
2,It didn't help me.,"Lets face it - if you are taking the Praxis, you are rolling the dice. I took a test that covered history from the beginning of the human race through the Reagan administration. I lucked out and passed. This book was no help to me."
4,IT TOOK ME BACK HOME,"I REALLY LIKE IT, SEEING HARLEM FROM WHERE I'M AT HERE IN MASSACHUSETTS, IT'S ONE OF THE BLACK CULTURAL CENTERS OF THE COUNTRY"
2,Oddly useful,"I learned how to relax, and gradually see ""SEX"" written in advertising. I was able to show other people how to see it.Then one day I saw it written on a log, and later on a stone. This taught me something important about how the evidence of my own senses can be altered by social motivation, and gave me insight into cult behavior. Perhaps not what the author was trying to convey, but well worth the price of the book, in the end."
3,Terrifying,"A friend loaned me this book, about 20 years ago, or so. To this day, I describe pictures from it, to point-out devious advertising techniques. Since my memory of the book was fading, I ordered a copy on-line. The picture ""supplement"" was missing about half of its pages from the copy recieved from Amazon, that's why I only rated it three stars. (Caveat: It was the cheapest copy available at Amazon, so no hard feelings.) Once you see the material in this book, you'll know how badly we're being manipulated. And if that doesn't scare you enough; the book is about 30 years old (or more)! I doubt that advertisers have raised their standards since then."
2,a bunch of hooey,"If this book is a bunch of hooey, then why two instead of one star? Because it's rather interesting to read, and also interesting looking at the pictures the author includes as examples, trying to locate exactly what he is talking about. Me, perhaps one or two instances seemed to vaguely contain the element of suggestion described by the author but it was so vague and ambiguous that I don't know why it would even be noticed by anyone.I read this book a long time ago, back when it was first released in paperback. The premise sounded so interesting I just had to buy it. Once I started reading it, I was scratching my head thinking I must be missing something here because I just didn't see what was supposed to be so very evident and clear once it was pointed out by the author.If you want to see if you are able to see little hidden words in the pictures then by all means buy this book but if you are looking for something truly useful, don't waste your money."
1,Subliminal Seduction,"I am not surprised that these pictures are seducing us. Did you notice that nearly all of the ads that the author shows us come from Playboy magazine? He even says so in the book. Call me biased, but this book gives me an icky feeling because he focuses so much on how ""Sex"" is engraved everywhere. Why does he focus only on that?"
4,An interesting novel...,I read this book (and it's sequel) 20+ years ago and a couple of times since. They are both entertaining and I think would be good starting books for youths interesten in the si-fi/fantasy genre...especially young girls.
3,Grilling,"I don't know why I expected more from this but I did. Iguess because i have become accustomed to receiving interesting esy recipes from the makers of cooking equipment. There are many standard recipes here and all seem like they will be good. I am wondering if the cards won't blow all over my deck. BUT, it is a good standard grilling book."
4,Not for young children,"We bought this book for our 8 and 10 year old, who LOVE the ""I'm a Puppy, Hear Me Yap."" However, we quickly learned that this book has some content that is not for children. My 10 year old was confused by all the ""bad"" words. She wondered why it used the word ""jackass"" and why it talked about animals having sex.A great book, but beware of the content for younger kids."
2,Cheap Romance?,"I picked up the book out of curiosity- since Barbara Cartland is in the top 10 bestselling author of all time.What a disappointment: The plot is beyond simple!!! The first 3 pages and you can automatically know what will happen in the end. Well, since a large romance books doesn't have much of unpredictable qualities, this should be fine as long as the author is great at bring in life in to the stories- with detail, emotions, beautiful literature and great story telling skills. Well, I can assure you, this book has none of that: The sentence are choppy, all over the place and not well connected. The emotion of characters in the book are described in a shallow way..ect... Yeah, it would take forever to describe all the flaws of the book.So yeah, if you want some easy read, not a lot to think, slightly amusing romance stories, this book is for you. Otherwise, be prepared! This will be the first and last book of Barbara Cartland that I purchased."
3,Needs an external power supply,"A macbook pro doesn;t have enough power to spin up the drive. Before you buy this, check to see how much power your USB ports put out. Most are 500. This needs 1000. You can buy a power supply or a USB booster for it, but they seem to be permanently out of stock at WD, which means the drive is totally useless to me."
3,Great item but doesn't work with my Powerbook G4,I like this little portable drive. It works well with my Macmini but does not work with my Powerbook G4. I probably would have to use the electrical cord but the defeats the purpose.
1,Stay away (or at the very least buy a backup for this trash),Worked for almost a month. Luckily this piece of junk started to flake out on me (started making grinding noises) before it totally bit it. So I bought another drive (320GB Lacie) and transferred my files just in time; this piece went the very next time I tried to use it. Can't format it - I'm looking for my receipt so that I can return it.
5,Scoobie Doobie Doo!,"My 5 year old boy just loves this book, he either wants to leaf through the pages or have a story read from it every night. Of course all the stories follow the same scooby-doo formula, but for kids that's probably a reassuring thing, the monsters always end up bad guys that get caught by the heroes."
3,kids love it but long stories,The stories are very long but the kids absolutely love Scooby and usually pick this book out for bedtime reading. The only problem I have is that each story has a different font and some of the fonts are squiggly and hard to read and make my eyes water and blur and it's hard to focus. It's weird but if you have the book you'll know what I mean!
5,Excellent purchase!,"This book was out of print, but Amazon offered some ""used"" copies, and I selected one that was brand new--in perfect condition for my five yr. old grandson!"
1,Not the epic it tries to be. Not even close,"I went into this with high hopes. It stars Chang Yi, Carter Wong, Roc Tien Peng, Polly Shang Kwan, Kam Kong and Cliff Lok. One big problem is that the story is very boring. The dialogue made me cringe. Everything is so simple it is really painful to watch. Some of the fights are good, but most of the fights are with Cliff Lok and another guy who play the main villain's top two henchmen. There will be a good fight going on, and all of a sudden they do this move where Cliff Lok goes jumping over his opponent and hitting him in the back, and then the fight ends immediately. Right when the fight starts to get good, it ends. Overall it is just a very very bad movie. Definitely one of director Joseph Kuo's worst.1.5/5Picture quality on the Videoasia DVD is good. Sound is hard to hear. AND PLEASE NOTE that because of poor manufacturing this disc will only play on some DVD players."
4,Shaolin Kids,"This movie is very good, I bought a copy from a different website where it was titled, ""Shaolin Kids."" It is a bit slow to pick up, and sadly Carter Wong only has one fight that is sorely dissapointing. He still plays a classic part with a beard and mustache, but Polly is the main character and most of the fights are sadly carter-wong less. If you want Carter Wong and Polly try the First 18 Bronzemen, or for an awsome movie with Carter Wong + Casanova Wong, try The Legendary Strike."
1,PRAYING IS THE CORRECT TERM,"THIS IS A GOOD MOVIE THAT I WAITED SEVERAL YEARS TO COME OUT IN THE U.S.... I FIRST SAW IT BACK IN 1985 WHILE LIVING IN OKINAWA. SO AFTER 20 YEARS I FINALLY GET A COPY AND TO MY SURPRISE IT DOESNT WORK ...LOL... IF U CAN VERIFY WITH THE SENDER THAT IT WORKS BEFORE THEY SHIP I WOULD DEFFINATELY PICK THIS ONE UP... ILL KEEP TRYING UNTIL I GET ONE THAT WORKS, BUT IN THE MEANTIME I WILL PRAY IT WORKS ...LOL... I BELIEVE THEY IMPORTED A BAD BATCH OVER HERE TO THE U.S., THERES PROBABLY GOING TO BE ALOT OF RETURNS, UNTIL THEY SORT OUT THE BAD ONES."
1,Down the Drain,"Honestly, I wasn't expecting much and that's what I got. Good thing it was only $4 so I didn't feel like I was ripped off too bad. If you're a high school student in a regular English class and have to pass the test on Friday, this is $4 well spent. If you have any other desire for this or any higher understanding, this is a waste of your time. It summarizes very well and has some fairly useful historical information. Photos are few and very outdated. the PDF file itself is simply a scanned-in copy of a pamphlet. The producer didn't even bother to have it typed up into a PDF file, so some of the pages are off-center or slanted. Really annoying. All the info is extremely superficial. Pretty disappointed and feeling cheated."
2,Would not suggest this one.,"It is great as a curling iron, well...as good as any other you'd get at Target or Wal Mart but if you do buy it and plan on using it as a straightener, be prepared to buy it often.I went through three of these in less than a year because the locking device that keeps it closed so that you can use it as a regular curling iron breaks VERY EASILY!!"
1,A Huge Let Down!,"I purchased this item at Wal-mart. I was so excited because it offered the ceramic curling/straightening capability in one unit for a great price. Sadly, my excitement quickly faded. After only a few uses (a week span time), the clamp knobs popped off, the lock feature broke and the ceramic itself started to chip! Trust me this wasn't due to any misuse or abuse on my part. The product is simply very poorly made and a waste of money!!"
4,better than average,This is better than average the straightener but hte curling iron doesnt work that well. i use this straightener everyday! if you are going to do this to keep your hair nice nad soft and healty you should either use Dove or Sheer Blonde/Brilliant Brunette (if you are a light red head (like me) go with the blonde shampoo and darker red heads go with the brunette shampoos) and if you are too lazy to use a blow dryer with a strighterner than you should use wet 2 straight
2,Complete piece of junk,"This straightener is completely terrible!! The plates don't close together completely so it only straightens your hair in random places. After using this, my hair looked worse than it did when I first woke up. The curling iron is just average. Do not buy this, it will NOT work."
1,Horrible!,"I received this straightener/curling iron as a christmas present and it is the worst product ever. It smells like the plastic on it is burning, the straightener doesn't even clamp closed on my hair to straighten it . The locking device on it, is horrible, it takes several tries to get it to lock shut. It doesn't get anywhere hot enough even when put on 25. The curling iron doesn't clamp tight onto my hair either so I don't even get a decent semi curl out of it! When you do close it, you can clearly see a gap between into between the ceramic plates. Also the on/off button is right where you would lay your hand on the handle to hold the straightenter so you constantly have to check to make sure you didn't switch it off!"
1,do not buy this it is dangerously hot,"This product is unsafe. The heat dial goes up to 20. I had it on 5 and dropped it on my arm with less than one second of contact. I received third degree burns that did not heal for three weeks and will probably leave a 1"" x 3"" scar on my arm for life. I can't even imagine what it would do set on 20, probably burn your hair off and anything else it touches. It should be recalled."
1,Worst Straightener Ever,"Words cannot express my dissatisfaction with this product. It takes me close to ten minutes to straighten my hair, even on the highest heat setting. What's more, due to the fact that the straightener does not close completely, my hair still isn't perfectly straight when I am through. Inside of the straightener are screws holding it together, and my hair regularly gets caught on the screws and ripped out. On top of all of this, the hinge snapped one day while I was using it and the straightener literally fell apart. I have happily replaced this flat iron with a new one, but I don't know if the emotional scarring the Revlon straightener left behind will ever heal. For the love of hair, do NOT buy this product!"
1,Customer service was the worst,"The little locking tab broke withing the first week. When I called Revlon, they said ""not my problem, call Helen of Troy"". I did - and they sent me a replacement that is so badly constructed that I can see the wires in the joint ."
1,Poor Quality,"Very poor quality. I liked the combo b/c I travel a lot and its convenient. Also both heat at the same time so I can use either. However, after using one for a month the hinge broke. Thinking I had a defective one, I returned it and got another. The same thing happened.I would recommend the Conair Ceramic 2-N-1 Straightener & Curling Iron instead. The hinge is in the middle so not as much strain is put on it. The Conair is working great so if you want a 2 in 1 combo I would skip the Revlon and get the Conair.Conair Ceramic 2-N-1 Straightener & Curling Iron"
3,Average,"Works well, but workmanship on handle is poor. I bought one around March and the handle cracked and would no longer lock in place. I bought a second one around July and it's cracked and broken again."
2,not a fan,"I just bought this straightener today, but I was sad to find out that the two irons don't come together close enough for it to apply enough pressure to really straighten your hair. My hair is usually very quick and easy to straighten too. The curling iron part works alright, but it's can kind of rip on your hair...I got this for $15 at walmart and I'm going to take it back tomorrow and try to find something better. :)"
5,loved it,like mother of 3 i had previously purchased this item and when it finally died.. i was frantic to find another one and after searching thru all my local dept stores with no luck .. decide to look for one online and was excited when i came across one on amazon.com... i would def recommend this item.. now keep in mine that i have very thin and fine hair .. but it works perfect on my hair!
1,Don't bother....,I liked this product when I first bought it. My hair isn't curly but I sometimes wanted it to just be sleeker so the flat iron worked well enough for me. However it soon fell apart. Don't waste your money!
1,Horrible product!,I was really looking forward to receiving this item but was extremely disappointed when I used it! It does not do what it is designed for: hair straightening. The two ceramic plates do not touch completely so your hair will only get hot but not straight. i tried holding it in from different places but after and hour i just gave up. It usually takes me 15 minutes to straighten my hair but after an hour with this product I realized that it was useless. terrible return policy so its not even worth the try. I recommend that you DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM! it is a waste of money and will only frustrate you.
3,Not too bad...good idea.,"When I bought it I liked it. It curls great and the straightening was not too bad. You had to hold the end tight to get a good straight but it worked. Then I noticed it was pulling my hair through the sides...ouch! Then eventually the spring broke inside and it would not pop open like it should which made it very difficult to straighten. Needless to say it is in the garbage now. I wish I could find one just like this that did not pull my hair and break, at a reasonable cost. The CHI version of this is around $130.00."
2,Not what I expected,"From reading all the other reviews, I thought this would be the best deal for a straightner/curling iron in one. The curling iron works great, and if you are looking for a curling iron I would recommend a Revlon. However, the straightner did not work on my hair at all. My hair is almost naturally straight just with a little wave here and there, and it couldnt even straighten out the little waves. I had to turn mine up to the highest temperature, and then the outside of the barrel was the only part that really got hot. When you clamp the straightner together the plates do not touch. You have to squeeze the black part on the end really hard to make it actually touch your hair, and if you do that little pieces of your hair get snagged on the plate and pulled out. I would not recommend this product to anyone."
5,Vanilla Ice Is The Man!!,i went crazy looking for this cd!...i checked everywhere...the only store that sold it was Best Buy...i was so excited when i got home...i was finaly able to listen to it...Vanilla Ice is seriously the man! lol...i will always love him...and everyhing he does!...im loving the cd!...later days
1,Why?,The VH1 special on this clown should have been the final nail in the casket. Why is he back? Why are we inflicted with this anthrax for the soul? Yuuuuuck.
1,What is this crap?,"Ok, I don't like Vanilla Ice, and V-Ice is just as crappy. whats up with ""V-Ice"" anyways? It's like ""J-Lo"" and ""P-Diddy"". He's gotta copy everyone else to be cool. Like he always did. Like when he ripped off Queen and David Bowie with his ""Ice, Ice Baby."" What an ass. And all you freaks that listen to him... I'm sorry... he just flat out sucks."
1,Vanilla Ice- YOU ARE HORRIBLE,"Vanilla Ice has no talent. Ice, your not a rapper, and your not a rocker, so don't combine the two. Zack de la Rocha and Fred Durst are the only ones who can do that good. Ice, don't diss Dave Grohl either- he is so much more talented that you are, your just jealous Nirvana made you unpopular back in 1991. Why should it bother you that he dressed up as a woman in the video for Learn To Fly, so much for promoting your album, you use a chance to get people to hear about how ""good"" this new album is, and you waste it on dissing one of the greatest rock stars of all time. Vanilla Ice- your worthless!!!!!!"
1,PHONEY,"BIG PHONEY IS BACK MISS THE BIG HAIR...NOW HE THINKS HE'S A ROCKER! HALF RIP OFF ROCK AND HALF RIP OFF HIP HOP FROM SIBURBAN WHITE BOY. ""HOTT SEXX"" IS MAYBEE STUPIDIST SONG OF HIS UNMATCHED STUPID SO-CALLED CAREER. AT LEAST ITS GOOD FOR A LAUGH AND SHOWS HOW GOOD REAL ROCK AND HIP HOPPERS ARE BY COMPARING"
4,Bipolar is worth checking out.,"Bipolar is a pretty damn good offering from V-Ice, especially from the hardcore / heavy metal point of view. The first 8 songs on this album totally rock. If you didn't know beforehand, you would probably think you are listening to Pantera. V-Ice really gets down on these first 8 tracks with some surprising new vocal talents never heard before on his albums. It is definatly worth checking out and probably won't dissappoint. It definatly didn't dissappoint me."
4,Iceman is back,"This release is total class. It shows us what the ICEMAN is all about these days, with no weak flows in site. The rock portion of the CD is heavy and reminded me somewhat of Papa Roach. The rap section of the CD will definatley split yo wigs. Get it now, you wont be dissapointed."
3,Still better than any Celine Dion CD I have ever heard....,"Well, what can one say? Vanilla Ice is trying to keep with the trends. He obviously bought a Limp Bizkit CD, thought to himself, ""hey I can do this"", and proceeded to hire a guitarist, a bass player and a drum machine. To bad he didn't hire a lyricist because that is where he needs the most help. The guitar grooves are good and heavy, but listen to the lyrics, I mean really listen. They are no better than his other work, they are simply hidden under a crunchy guitar and a decent beat."
2,Vanilla strikes out again!,"Let's face it, the iceman is not tough, he's not hard and he certainly is not talented. However, he makes a good run at it with his latest installment, ""bi-polar"". Like the previous album, v-ice comes back with ripping guitars and a rough voice that never really seems to go anywhere.(Although, the second half of the cd is strickly rap, but that isn't much better) He lacks lyrical skill, rappin' about how wonderful and slick and rich he is. Once again there is no truth in anything icy raps about. I have a couple of pointers for him to follow: 1. Lay off the vanilla ice or v-icething. It is old and stale.2. Leave music alone and stick withyour motorcyle career.p.s. Thanks for ice, ice baby. Still love it!"
2,weak,"This album is weak. Vanilla Ice's poor, unoriginal lyrics, and over use of guest appearances is all this album has. And that aint much. In this album V tries too hard to make himself seem badass, and comes off like some loser wanna be rapper. And saying that eminem is just a rip off of him is ridiculous, eminem has lyrics that people care about, which is another place where Vanilla Ice takes a beating. NO ONE CARES ABOUT YOU ANYMORE. Listen to this cd, then listen to Eminem's new one, then laugh at this one, and get your money back. If you really wanna listen to this album, download three songs off the net, thats more than enough to convince you that you dont want to listen to it any more."
2,Not very good,"This CD stinks. I liked Vanilla Ice's 1st rap/rock CD ""Hard to Swallowbut this one is nowhere near as good. The CD recording quality is low, the hip hop sounds like 2 kids in a closet. Not very good, I regret buying it."
5,Just as Shown,"The handle was exactly the one that I needed. My original black screws worked in it just fine. My original one cracked around where the screws go in, and this replacement fit perfectly into my door."
3,Too many small parts,"The toy is very cute but the parts are too small. It's difficult not to losethem. It was a bday gift for my 5 yr old but I have to hide it or my 3yr oldmight misplace them. Luckily, the girls never put stuff in their mouths orthat would be a big concern."
1,Drama with skin peeling of teddy bear,The little teddy bear's skin is peeling off and I am not the only one with this problem. International Play Thing's customer service told me there are no replacment bears and that's that. For an expensive set like that not acceptable. Plenty of drama from our daughter.
3,Prefer body glide,"This skin lube comes in a gel like a neosporin and it is about that thick. I had trouble spreading it evenly and making it work for me. I tried this after a friend recommended it to me. I think it may be better for longer runs or marathons, as I just used this for a 5-6 mile weekly run. I much prefer bodyglide stick and I actually spread that between toes sometimes using my finger. It's not bad, but overall I would want a less thick formula."
1,To much like another book . . .,"Richard Abanes comment's on Scientology are way too much like other comments on the same subject in a more well known Cult book. In the latter book, namely ""The Kingdom of the Cults,"" Mr. Abanes makes comments which are IDENTICAL to Mr. Kurt Van Gorden comments on the same subject. I'm talking ""the exact same syntax."" Someone plagiarized off someone. But who? Let me give you a hint: ""The Kingdom of the Cults"" came out a year before Abanes's book did. Don't beleive me? [...]"
4,Practical and Direct,"This book goes thru a variety of traffic engineering problems, assesing solutions and explaining in an simple way many concepts and technics used in the HCM (1994/97 updates).Very good for begginers....."
