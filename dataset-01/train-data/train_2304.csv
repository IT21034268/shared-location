4,Great heater for the money,"I put this heater in my bedroom, which is fairly small and is heated by the house's radiator system. However, the room is always a bit chilly. It does a great job warming up the space. I can set it on ""1"", which is the low power setting, and turn the thermostat to ""4"" and it knocks the chill out of the room in about 15 minutes.On the downside, it does smell bad when you first turn it on, but the smell burns off after a couple of uses.I would definitely purchase again."
3,Great for small spaces,"This heater gets very hot but does not blow the air around. If you have a small room to heat, this would be a perfect 5 star heater. If you are trying to use it for a larger room it has to be literally 6 inches away from you to feel the heat. Also, the back of this heater gets warm, and in the description it says that you can hang it on the wall...I do not recommend that."
1,"Wow, is it on? Oh wait... it is, but it is still 10 degrees in here.","Purchased this as an additional heater for an addition on our home, it does not put off enough heat to even notice it is on. It may work in a really small room, but for a larger room it does not even seem to make a dent in the temperature of the room. Mine is going to be returned."
3,DeLonghi HHP1500 Mica Panel Radiator,"Like how heater fits up to wall, and can be hung if desired. However, it does not emit the heat anticipated. Being on wheels, it is easy to move and reposition compared to long baseboard-type models. I have it in a relatively small room (about 12x12) and it makes only a modicum of difference in comfort. The room is used as an office so I only have it on when I'm in there (1-2 hrs. at most). Perhaps if left on for a longer period of time, the results would be more appreciable."
2,Cut and Paste Bio,"There are three types of unauthorized biographies, well-researched, pure speculation, and cut and paste. This is an example of the latter. The author gives us the Elvis Costello to be found in magazine interviews, and creates a whole book by taking information from a variety of sources and putting it all together into this quickie bio. Some decent insights into his recording career are to be found throughout, but this is really not well-done. You can put your time to better use by listening to a few Costello CD's and wonder about the workings of the man who created all this challenging music. That will bring you closer to understanding Elvis Costello than this book will."
2,Thin Account of Elvis,"One thing that you have to give credit to Tony Clayton-Lea for is that he right up front advises the reader that Elvis Costello had nothing and wanted nothing to do with this biography. Cooperation from the subject of a biography is, of course, immensely helpful in writing of the book, but by no means a necessity. Mr. Clayton-Lea offers an extremely pedestrian account of the life and times of Elvis Costello. The book reads like press clippings in many spots and offers no insight into the man's career. Being that there are barely any books on Mr. Costello, this book has a minimum of value for that reason, but not much else. if you are an avid fan of Mr. Costello, then this book doesn't offer much, but if you are not that familiar with his career, then this book is a decent primer."
4,Very enjoyable book.,"I really thought this book was very engaging. However, the editing (whatever electronic typos are called) is ghastly. I was disappointed in that aspect; and for that reason, I gave it only four stars. I would still recommend the book though. Just be aware that there are some significant problems with the editing."
3,Not so great,"I bought this on a recommendation from friends, but it is not such a great story. O.K. as secondary literature for lower grades up till about 13 years, but there are much better written stories of value for this age group like The Auregole Quartet by Shirley Latessa."
2,Very offensive material to Jewish people.,"The premise of the story is that Jewish people have been looking in the wrong direction. Jews need to follow Jesus otherwise they are materialistic and full of vengeance. All the characters (of course they are Jewish) who accept Jesus are loving. Those who do not are narrowminded, mean, and self-centered. Throughout the book, the author belittles Judaism, while at the same time, never really explains Judaism. Does the author have any real knowledge about Judaism? How can she criticize a religion if she does not understand its beliefs or practices? Many of the comments I have read come from school age children. This book promotes one religion over another and should not be used for instruction in the public schools. There are many books that teach concepts of love and peacefulness without getting into religious material. The religious nauture of this book offends me. If my children were required to read this book, I would be furious."
2,helping,this book is about several people who tries to fight rome and one of them wants jesus to help but he doesnt
5,Historical Fiction at its best!,"The Newberry Award winning novel, The Bronze Bow, is a delightful tale set in the Roman Empire during the lifetime of Jesus. Readers will discover the Roman Army's reach is far with conscripts from far away places in the empire. Portions of the Bible come alive with vivid descriptions of the Zealots and the miraculous encounters with Jesus himself. An educational and fascinating read."
3,A very good novel,"I was impressed with the way Jesus was in the story:rarely spotlighted,but significant nonetheless.Use of historical times and even historical characters(Jesus and his apostles) enahnces the story further.The main characters had to realize that Jesus was a Saviour,each in his or her own way.Leah was wonderful,because she always knew Jesus was special.She had the sort of simple, childlike Faith in Jesus which He responds the best to.The story shows the trust and intimacy that can grow between friends-of more than one sort."
3,Power of love,"I certainly never expected to encounter among the Newberys a book of historical fiction where the main character meets Jesus!Daniel is a young man growing up in Israel during the time of the Roman occupation. Daniel wants nothing more than to rid his land of the hated Roman legions. He joins a band of warriors who are preparing an army to go up against the Romans, but, in time, he sees that the hatred of the band against the Romans is not conquering them. He hears about a rabbi who goes from village to village, preaching love not hate, and he comes to meet up with Jesus and sees with his own eyes the power of love."
1,Good,"This is a good book,if you have ever lost anyone close to your heart. It will help you let go of the anger."
5,Very good book!,"I enjoyed the Bronze Bow. It was a change from Speare's usual Colonial America books. I enjoyed the beginning like most Speare books and this one actually kept me hooked. I didn't care much for some of the characters though. But I did like the descriptions and the reality of Leah, who became my favorite. But this book may get some people not so happy, due to religious things."
5,This is a great book!,This is one of my all-time favorite books!! The author is so great! If you enjoy this book you should also read The Witch of Blackbird Pond and Calico Captive. I loved them also.
3,Boning knife,I simply had no other way to replace this knife I lost. Kind of expensive trying to keep this set together as one...
4,Good Western,"Good fight scene. Do not tell me what I should write. If I like it, I like it and say so."
5,Amazing!!,This book was incredible. It casts relationships and behaviors in an entirely different and positive light. Anyone who has ever struggled to understand their place in a close family or romantic relationship would appreciate this book.
3,Wanted More,"The situations described were extremely interesting, and I was impressed with the author's unflaggingly positive view of things that are usually considered wholly negative. However, I wished there had been more info on each one; perhaps more follow-up. Several of the anecdotes remained quite mysterious."
2,For Callas Diehards,"Only diehard Callas enthusiasts and those who already know the work well should consider buying this CD. To begin with, the opera is sung in Italian-when Gluck actually made a point of writing it in French! In addition, the male singers are all woefully inadequate, and Sonzogno's Gluck sounds more like bad Puccini. As usual with Callas, there are thrilling moments (for instance, the wonderful opening scene), but they never add up to a complete portrayal, and, although she sings with great elegance and poise, the overall peformance is disappointing. Those who wish to hear what wonders she could accomplish in Gluck should listen to her Alceste, which is another matter altogether."
3,Mall Tycoon 3,"I play alot of these tycoon games, this game was the lowest quality. It was just ok, not very fun. Stick with zoo tycoon or roller coaster tycoon better than this by far. It just lacked alot of the normal options that make these games entertaining. Just ok."
4,Great game before a great fall...,"The game is/was great before I accidentally dropped the computer, where the game was loaded on, out the window. I was basically cheering with so much joy, my knees hit the table where the notebook was on and the computer pretty much flew out of the window from the second floor of my vacation home. Before the shocker, the game plays very well and will make most people very happy. I recommend this game (just make sure your computer is secure on its table. lol)"
2,????,I am still trying to figure this game out. I played one day and haven't been back to it. I don't know how to build the mall entrance or nothing. Another waste of money.
1,Junk program,Worst program I have ever experienced. The graphics are clunky and hard to navigate on a 2010 computer. What they were like on earlier computers must have been painful. Having worked in managment of a real mall I can honestly say the business model the game uses is unrealistic. Factors such as parking cannot be designed in and employee requirements are not realistic. leave this one alone.
3,"Okay, not great though","I will admit that I don't do that much archery, but when I have used this armguard, it feels somewhat flimsy and isn't the most comfortable. So, if you just want a bottom-dollar product that gets the job done but isn't necessarily very comfortable, than this will be fine. I'd suggest it to beginners and people like me who are fickle about hobbies and won't necessarily use it all the time."
4,Arm Guard,works as advertised. if you think you don't need an arm guard you will soon be convinced otherwise. Protect yourself-
4,Nice,"A very good arm guard, it fits very comfortably and fits tightly on your arm. highly recommended. able to be used on either arm"
1,Dont waste your money!,"Well first of all,I ordered this a week before Christmas, and then was informed AFTER it was paid forThat it was out of stock...I decided to wait for it to come instead of cancelling then..When it finally came, approximately 10days after Christmas..I openned the parcel and burst out laughing..I could have made a better one myself for cheaper!!!Don't waste your money."
2,Not real leather.,"This product might be good for a child, but is unsuitable for anyone else. It definitely will not last though. The straps are too small for most anyone with any arm muscle, and on top of that the product description is inaccurate because it is not real leather. The straps are also held together with cheap velcro tabs. So bad I decided to return it and make my own."
2,Smaller than I thought,"I will not be so cheap next time and get the larger one, my forearm will thank me. Yours will too!"
1,Super tiny. Not for adults!,"This thing is so small my 4 y.o. Could use it.Description said ""one sze fits all"" it does, if I put it on my pinky.If you are an adult you might want to find something else."
1,Extremely poor quality - re-tread video,I was greatly dissapointed by the quality of the video. It was obviously a copy from a bulk copying system. The image was jumpy throughout on different playback systems.What a trashy waste of money.
3,"Definitely not for the audiophile, but hey, for the price...","This is about the most basic surround sound system I have ever seen- not a single bell or whistle. It is easy to set up because there are no options. However, it does produce surround sound, and it is noticeable (some simulated surround sound systems barely have any sound coming from the rear). The system set up is dummy-proof, and while the sound quality is not crystal clear (occasionally the sound is muffled, and the midrange will crack if it hits its relatively low high end),it usually does its job, and for the price, I am surprised how well the system works. I have had this system for three or four years, and it is still running smoothly. The one complaint: Even a cheap system can have a basic display. The only way to tell which component is on is to listen for the right sound or count the blinks from the power light as you hit the component button."
5,Enjoyable and inspirational,"After reading Altered Vizion by Andy Levine, I was very impressed with his style and creativity of putting his thoughts and feelings into his writing. His emotions shine through the pages, allowing the reader to be able to relate to the poems on a more personal level.I highly recommend this book to those who wish to take a closer look at their own lives in order to discover themselves more clearly."
1,Not worth the money,"The ink does not stick very well, making it hard to see. You have to go over it two or three time to make the lettering stand out at all. The durability is lacking, one good squeeze and the handle breaks off. Spend your money elsewhere."
5,"Good quality, good configurations, and lighweight","bought this from amazon.com for $200 after rebate. this was the best deal I could get on a name brand 19"" lcd monitor. other competitors were selling same configurations for more than $300. plus, this comes with 3 yr warranty, 12ms response time, and 600:1 contrast ratio. monitor is lightweight, 12 lbs. it's a space saver too, compared to the old viewsonic 19"" crt I had. easy setup. didn't have to use cd for setup; just connected monitor cable and it was working."
5,Acer baby! Sharp crystal clear image,"When i plugged this baby in all i could say is wow. Compared to dell flat panels this is much cripser and brighter. Great monitor, great price. Perfect for business, not sure abuot gaming though, im not a gamer."
4,Great Product Great price,Great monitor at a great price. Great size and great quality for the price. Can't be beat. I Love it.
3,dead pixel but great lcd for price,notice a dead pixel in the center of screeneverything else was greatcan't beat the pricereturned and reordered another onehope it has no dead pixels on screenhad to pay higher price to reorder
5,If you want to keep your mind sharp...,"This isn't just a book of jumbles, it is games for smart people. The logic and crossword puzzles are really challenging, and keep you on your toes. There are some light weight ones to help you cool down, but their annual treasure hunt is the best!"
5,semaG enizagam si tnellecxe!,"ev'I neeb gnidaer ti ecnis eht s'08. s'tI a lufrednow enizagam lluf fo cigol selzzup, sdrowssorc, selcitra, cte. ll'uoY evol ti! fI uoy nac daer siht, uoy tog tahw ti sekat ot yojne siht enizagam."
4,Very Cool!,"This necklace is indeed pretty awesome. But I just want to point out that it is 2 inches long. Quite larger than I expected. But that's okay. It is very detailed on the back with the whole body, and in the front, the skeletons hips are a bit... well, not as detailed. But the rope that comes with it is adjustable which is nice, and it is just plain cool. Going to enjoy having this!"
5,The nature of change,A fantastic overall look at the history of public relations. This book looks indepth at public relations as well as the more recent developments of issues and cris management.
5,Good Transaction,He/she was a good seller and I received the item within a reasonable amount of time and it was in good condition.
4,Quality performances by Daniels.,"Charles Daniels is in fine voice for the more popular and well-known songs here, but the more solemn works are rather heavy going. Thankfully, there are not many of the latter and for the most part this CD can be well recommended. The lute playing of David Miller is best described as sturdy and reliable."
2,Poor Instructional Guide--Avoid like the Plague,"I bought this kit with the hopes of learning how to knit--but alas, the instructions were difficult to understand and I ended up searching online to find out how to knit and purl. The nice part of the kit is that you have needles and yarn to start out with so you don't have to wander into a yarn store and stare cluelessly at the shelves. If you want to learn how to knit, get size 7 needles, a skein of cheap 100% acrylic, and ""The Knit Stitch"" and ""The Purl Stitch"" by Sally Melville. The website http://www.stitchguide.com/ has great video demonstrations of stitches as well, and was a great deal more helpful than the Reader's Digest booklet that came with the kit."
1,Lack of instruction!,I wanted to learn how to knit and fell for this one by the pretty cover. I discovered this was the worst kit for beginners! The instructions are very frusterating and unclear! I found more help on learning how to knit on yarn co's website which is FREE! I would NOT recommend this kit to any beginner!
1,BEINNERS BEWARE!!!!,Though the set is beautifully packaged the instructions (which are what counts) are s@#t. Minimal and unclear. Three short sentences accompanied by one picture was suppose to be enough to teach me how to cast on and that's pretty much their formula for everything-and it just does not cut it. I gave this one star because at least you get yarn and needles...but you'll definitely have to buy a better book to use them with!
4,Great cd,This is one of the best comp cd I got this year! Thanks for the great mix of these fine synthpop bands.
4,review,"I bought this cd because my fav band, Equatronic was on it. I collect all Equatronic release. I was pleasantly surprised that I enjoy every tracks from this compilation."
4,Great CD,"This is a great CD. Awesome punk tunes by Gus Chambers of GRIP INC.Gus picked up the remains of his 70's punk band and has reborn a classic.Great Tunes All are winners, simple punk that rocks.Check out the tune ""Scapegoat"" it begins with a phone message from Dave Lombardo drummer in GRIP INC. apparently firing Gus from the band. Wow pure treachery on tape.Buy The AlbumR.I.P Gus"
3,Item not as pictured!,"Buyer beware, You don't get what you see in the photo.The battery (or I should say batteries) arrived today. The picture shows a complete set (with fuse and connector) fully assembled. What I received were two battery halves, some rubber cable guards, screws, and washers. Nowhere in the description does it say that the item you receive will be anything less than what is pictured.I would be ok with re-using the connector and fuse from my old battery pack, except that the battery I'm replacing had some corrosion that ate away at the fuse. So it needs to be replaced as well.The price is good, so I can't complain too much, but had I known I wouldn't be getting everything shown, I would have ordered a new fuse at the same time.(In case you aren't aware, the fuse is located beneath the black cover on the top and towards the back in the picture.)"
3,Replacement part for one that died after two years,"Worked as advertised, until it went totally dead. The power brick is dead, no idea if the control unit died too, just purchased this one as a replacement. The antenna moves, so the original actuator is still in place."
1,Garbage,"Installed 8/09 The 9537 rotor and controller broke. This is senior owned, no kids playing with anything and (even though I don't feel like it)to be fair we were good till severe cold set in but we actually did not try to move anything during that below zero weather but when it got 25% and over we tried but all was dead. The good news is that I managed to use a pioneer cable box code and at least got controller operating. If I could have this review would have been starless."
3,Only a year,"We upgraded our antennae, and rotator last summer.The control box didn't even last a year."
4,Channel Master Antenna Controller,The antenna rotator controller does what it is supposed to do. I hope this item has a longer service life than the old one.
1,Antenna Rotator,"This product is VERY HARD TO UNDERSTAND AND LEARN TO USE!It might be good for the younger minds, but not for us OLD GEEZERS who liked the original Channel Master controllers!Now if only they would make copies of the original controllers, that would get my vote for a better product!This model ""Sucks!"""
5,Acid rock soul,"These guys are very rock bluesy, some kind of progressive/soul rock hybrid. The Doors had elements of that as did Canned Heat or even Jefferson Airplane. The music has got guitar, harmonica, tight drum work, ballsy female (and sometimes male) vocalist. Occasional horns. The music is tight but it breathes. Vinegar Joe has been a recent discovery for me. It fits in that category of obscure but talented early 70s hippy rockers. All the tracks are good on this album with standouts for me being the title-track ""Speedqueen of Ventura"", ""Never Met a Dog (that took to me)"", ""Buddy Can You Spare Me A Line"". A nice cover of Hendrix's ""Angel"". ""Black Smoke"" is hot. All the songs are good and groovy, the work of good musicianship and a very hip attitude. Recommended if you can find it."
4,You will Crack The GED!,"I purchased this book in hopes of finding a refresher for the GED, And this book was great! it was a very great study piece easy to follow and full of useful tips! My only problem is that when they go to explain most of the answers that it should give a bit more of details. However! I took the GED and passed with flying colors! The practice tests in this book is very close to the real thing!!! GOOD LUCK!"
3,"So What, You Never Heard of Them...","Much in need of a new fix of something to chill out to, I picked this fairly ceap compilation up on a whim and was pleasantly surprised. It's an import filled with cats you've likely never heard of, but here and there they rock admirably in the vein.Tracks 1 (""Alone"" by Don Carlos), 4 (""Nublado"" by Jerome Van Rossum), and 10 (""Antares"" by Omniverse) are very strong tracks that justify the impulse/curiosity purchase, especially at its price. If you're looking for cool stuff to pad out your set or collection that most people won't be hip to but isn't sitting there collecting dust, give it a whirl. It's the right price, the right ratio of good to bad (at least 3 keepers, and 2-3 more you MIGHT dig, all out of 10 tracks total), and just obscure enough to make you look well-traveled. AND it's truthfully advertised: these house tracks are chilled-out legit."
2,Not as wide as I'd like,"This is a great product, don't get me wrong. I bought it and thought I was getting a good deal because the price seemed really cheap, but I needed it to be twice as wide as it is. At this size, it's hardly worth the trouble. I ended up doubling up and the red plastic mulch really keeps out the weeds and helped my tomatoes grow well in a year when other growers really had a hard time."
4,Great Product,Very good product. As good as Dremmell. Would recommend this product to anyone. I will buy another one for gift.
5,Works perfectly,Great packaging and a great product. This envelope feeder was easy to install and worked perfectly. We were replacing an old non-working envelope feeder and the price was right.
3,3.5 stars - a solid UK melodic rock offering,"2004's Worlds Apart was the second and final release from UK melodic rockers Pulse. Pulse, which features members of Bob Catley's supporting band, delivers a polished, classy brand of AOR that obviously draws inspiration from classic bands like Journey and Foreigner. I also hear a fair amount of FM and maybe Lost Weekend in their sound.""Solid"" is the word that comes to mind listening to Worlds Apart. The musicianship, vocals, songwriting and production are all perfectly solid, if workmanlike. The whole album is smooth and totally enjoyable, but it's not very dynamic and doesn't leave much of an impression once the disc stops spinning.It may not be anything new under the sun, but Worlds Apart is still a very solid melodic rock album that should appeal to most fans of the genre. Fans of Lost Weekend, FM and Overland in particular should give Pulse a listen."
2,Culture Shock! Burma (Cultureshock Myanmar: A Survival Guide to Customs & Etiquette) (Purchased on 12/04/2011,The book needs to be updated to reflect current times. I was somewhat disappointed as to the elementary nature of the discriptions of daily life.
5,A remarkable Australian story,"""The Cup"" is a biographical film with a narrative that follows Australian jockey Damien Oliver and the 2002 Melbourne Cup.It is a story that contains many layers including: the strong bond between West Australian brothers Jason and Damien Oliver, the prestige and tradition of the Melbourne Cup, the 2002 Bali Bombing, and overcoming grief.The movie is compact and transpires at a steady pace, which allows the viewer to experience the different moods of the narrative in well timed portions.The viewer is treated to a quality cast and this film was esteemed Australian actor Bill Hunter's final work. Tom Burlinson who starred in both ""The Man from Snowy River"" films and ""Phar Lap: Heart of a Nation"" appears in a supporting role. Irish actor Brendan Gleeson provides a strong screen presence and Stephen Curry and Daniel MacPherson are energetic and poignant.It is a story that wonderfully captures the Australian spirit and persona.Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author"
4,great movie,"Being a horse person I thoroughly enjoyed this movie ""The Cup"". The Damien Oliver Story is an inspiration albeit very sad at times"
5,For the love of horses,Another great horse movie. This one portrays the Australian horse racing traditions and has you pulling for both horse and rider from the beginning.
2,That's It?,"I watched this whole movie expecting some compelling element to this story would emerge. I'm amazed that anyone would think to make a movie based on such a blah story.SPOILER ALERT!.SPOILER ALERT!.SPOILER ALERT!Jockey's father dies in a racing accident. Halfway through the movie, same jockey's brother dies in a racing accident. The rest of the movie is that same jockey losing race after race, while everyone wrings their hands, until he finally wins the last race.That's a story worthy of a movie?I fast forwarded though much of the dialog and even most of the races."
3,Not as good as I thought it would be,"Hi, I bought this product in a pack at Costco. I have to say that compared to other sauces I favor (my favorite so far is Trader Joe's tomato and basil marina in a can), this one is a bit bland. I am having it now again for the third or fourth time, and this time, it tastes better after adding salt, grated cheese and hot sauce. It probably is a sauce true to italian marina as I believe I see chunks of carrots and this is what is called for in my Italian cookbook. And perhaps I have gotten too used to the strong tomato flavor in other sauces, but I'm rating it mediocre due to the general lack of flavor."
5,Amazing and heartwarming,"Once again Angela Hunt writes a new classic. The subject of Roanoke is still a mystery, but she makes it seem like you could personally know every character. I never would have guessed that such a amazing book could ever exhist! I can't wait for the next book to come out."
5,Great Historical Fiction with a Christian theme,"Historical fiction requires an author ""do her homework"" to make it believable. Hunt's research into the mysterious Lost Colony at Roanoke enabled her to produce an outstanding historical novel. The characters are deep and complex, and there are plenty of twists and turns in the plot to keep you turning the pages. The only ""buyer beware"" for this book is that it does have a Christian theme to it, and the faith of the characters is a major part of the story. So, if you don't like Christianity in your fiction, this may not be a book for you. Otherwise, enjoy!"
1,roanoke poorly researched,"poorly researched, Revolver?? in the 15 hundreds, I think not. This book is a women's fantasies.Leave historical novels to people who have done the research."
2,Historical Fiction My Eye,"I am a real history buff, and have always been fascinated by the mystique surrounding the lost colony. So when this book popped up on a search, I bought it. right away inaccuracies started jumping out at me. I could ignore them at first, little nitpicking things like mannerisms and religious practices, but when someone pulled a revolver and shot and native, that was too much. Revolvers wouldn't be invented for over 200 years after this story took place. I stopped reading right there and deleted the book from my Kindle. For heavens sake! Did the author do any research?As far as I'm concerned the author owes me $3.49."
2,Boring...,"This book never truly hooked me. As a historical buff, I was excited to set sail to the Lost Colony of Roanoke Island, but I got lost along the way. The first 1/4 of the story moved painfully slow, but when it hit a very unexpected flashback just to fill in some historical facts, I found myself shipwrecked. Like Gilligan and the passengers, I tried to find my way off of it and to sail onward. I almost made it to the halfway mark, but decided to walk the plank and give up the journey.I was disappointed in the writers' ability to intertwine the fiction story into the historic. It moved too slowly. The main character was a blur. My optimism in looking for the hook drove me to read as far as I did. Bottom line: I found it historical, yet painfully boring."
5,"Straightforward, praise worthy, honest.","Angela Elwell Hunt has done it again. Another story of actual people, done convincingly and as close to fact as possible. She leaves no time for fantasy, this is real life, along with the pain and joy. What a blessing this book was to me, in that Jocelyn was the wife God called her to be, even through the hurt and pain of rejection...I can't wait to read the next one in the series."
4,Burning ball,"This is a beautiful shoe, but it causes a burning ball of the foot. I have a narrow foot, and this shoe is tight, and causes you to walk on the ball of your foot. You can not wear for long periods of time. But again, beautiful shoe, so I guess it is true ""it hurts to be beautiful""."
3,spanish,"Product came on time, but had to send it back because it was the wrong edition (my mistake), i emailed them and got a quick response on how to return the item"
4,"good general overview, introduction","This book provides a good general overview/introduction of bioinformatics, genomics and proteomics. It does assume, however, that the reader has at least an introductory background in biology and chemistry. If this is not the case, you will probably find this book too advanced.I liked all of the websites and recommended readings for additional information as the Internet is sometimes a pain to search, so it is nice to have some good site recommendations. The chapters are concise and written well, but again, if you haven't studied these subjects before, I think the book will go over your head. All in all a good general overview for the beginning scientist- aka high-school level or intro college level."
2,First contact,"If you don't know anything about Bioinformaticas, this book is very adeccuacy for your first time"
1,Teahouse Birdfeeder,"The feeder is very inadequate for avid bird watchers. It is very difficult to refill the feeder with seed. The top is to twist off yet nearly breaks when trying. I have had to resort to unscrewing the bottom plate to fill with seed. I hate to toss it out since I just bought it but other than look pretty, it is useless."
3,Bird-brained List Price,"Nice-looking, though obviously plastic feeder. My objection is Amazon.com's inflated list price, since this feeder is available at PetSmart for a buck more than this ""clearance"" price."
2,"Adventures of the Kentucky Pioneer ""D. Boon""","This book is a nice sketch of the life of Daniel Boone, first published by the University Press of Kentucky in 1978. While it does not compare with the larger and more valuable biographies of Draper, and Bakeless, and lacks the primary value of Boone's own account of himself in Filson's ""Kentucke"" (1784), it is a nice survey, and may be more appreciated by younger readers, or by those new to the subject, than the larger volumes."
5,Great Quality,"Bought these to replace junky-chinese made Trailmaster kit that fit so poorley it LOWERED the truck. The Ready Lift was worth the extra cost, and fit perfectly. I wish I had bought these the first time around."
2,Birds aren't attracted to this feeder!,"I filled this feeder with the three most highly recommended foods for my area (thistle, black oil sunflower seed, and a mixed seed blend for songbirds) and hung it in the same place where my old feeder was. My old feeder had to be refilled every 1-2 days; not a single bird has come to this feeder and I've had it up for 10 days!!! There is no place for birds to perch while they're eating! It's a beautiful feeder, that's why I was attracted to it. Unfortunately, the birds don't care how pretty it is....they don't see it as a practical food source."
1,Feeder gone bad!,"I purchased this feeder excited about the design and look it would add to my garden and was VERY disappointed to see that no birds ever fed from it. I tried everything to attract birds including hanging another feeder close by and nothing worked. After hanging for one and a half years and having wasted three different fillings of food, I ended up throwing the feeder away because it wasn't even worth giving to Goodwill."
5,Great reading primer! Second in the series.,I've used this book for over 15 years in my classroom. This series is a great way to teach children to read. Each story scaffolds on the previous story. Your students won't even realize their learning because the reading is so interesting and the pictures are so colorful.
1,Disappointing !!!,"Unless you are very young , weak, a small and petit woman with absolutely no grip strength to begin with , these will not help you . They appear in the picture to be similar to the ""Voit"" hand grippers from back in the day (the pic looks identical)which were very good, but they are not . The Company ships promptly and service is good but the product I got was not like the one pictured , different shade blue (who cares) but the resistance I needed in an ""extra heavy weight"" wasn't there. What can ya expect for $3.00 . The company offered to give a buck off for my disappontment but even this review isn't worth my time , it's a public service.Respectfully"
2,not as shown,These are NOT the grippers shown. 2 yrs ago they were. Black is much easier then it should be.
1,Wasted my money,"First of all it says that blue is ""extra heavy tension,"" it is not. The package says that black is. I've been looking for a good pair since mine broke some years ago, and this is the worst one yet. They don't tell you the pounds of resistance in the description, so here it is:blue - heavy - 24lbsblack - xtra heavy - 48lbsI didn't get the resistance I ordered, and if I had I still wouldn't have wanted them. I got ripped off."
3,Too light for a man,"If you are a man looking for heavy or medium strength grip - do not waste your money on any of these. X-Heavy I got are in reality light. It may be OK for women or/and in case you want to hold something in your hand constantly squeezing for a long time on train or during the walk - then these may be OK.X-heavy should be labeled ""men-light, women - medium/heavy""."
3,Not Quite as Advertised,"These hand exercisers are simple and durable. I'm able to use them, and they're especially convenient while walking or hiking. My disappointment is that they were touted as having extra-heavy tension. Based on my experience with hand grips (I've had at least a dozen pairs over the course of 20+ years), that's not the case. Their tension (resistance to squeezing) is moderate to semi-heavy. As a result they're not as effective, for me, as I'd anticpated they'd be."
3,It is what it is,"As long as you don't expect anything fancy, which it's obviously NOT, then this product works. The thing I *don't* like about it is that my fingers constantly slip up the top making too much pressure on my fore fingers. I suggest going with aomething that has a slip-grip."
3,small grips,"I have large hands and these have fairly small grips, and I can only use 3 of 4 fingers to squeeze them. They otherwise are well constructed and work well."
4,Good Product,The exercise grip worked well for our grandson and arrived quickly and as described in time for christmanThanks so much
5,hand grips,the product was better than expected and went well with other products I purchsed from this vendor thanks for the buy
3,"An academic source book, not an art book","I've always been fascinated by ancient Indian temples, so I ordered this book assuming that it would be a coffee-table/art book filled with large beautiful pictures with some descriptive text spattered about here and there. It turns out that it was not a coffee-table book at all, but instead is academic textbook for serious architectural study. Instead of the beautiful color pictures I was expecting, the book contains many pictures (black and white unfortunately) and hand-drawings of details after details. Just the shear number and detail of the hand-drawings is quite impressive. One annoyance is that all the text is in the front and pictures in the back, so you will have to keep flipping back and forth. In summary, the book was not for me (a reader with a casual interest in temple architecture), but probably is an excellent source for the academic architect requiring an in-depth study of the subject."
4,an excellent read -,I found this book to be an excellent and refreshing read. This illustrations were a very nice touch. The author has done a fine job of keeping moral tradition alive.
3,A CD of mixed quality,"This particular CD has several groups performing some very fine examples of baroque and renaissance music, unfortunately the performers seem to range in quality from the very best (like Kirkby) to community stage performers (or so it sounds) (like Griffith?). I thought the best piece was Dido's lament - it has more expression than Bonney's cool performance on Faire Isle to me. It is worth purchasing if you don't have such a CD but I would recommend getting CDs by composer or artist since it is sometimes hard for me to listen to a CD through which has such a mixture of talent. E Benoit"
4,reasonably price.good everday silverware i like it!,mi kitchen is all read mostly and black some and lovely wood oak so these match perfecto!i like it alot reasonably price i love AMAZON DEALS always finda great deal imo anyhow!adios and happy new year everyone.
2,propane better,propane puts out 10x the heat. You have to stand right under it to feel a difference.
2,"Great outdoor lamp, not so sure about heater","I'm 5'3 and when this is on full blast (both rings are turned on) I can barely feel anything. My husband who is 6'0 can feel the heat but only when he is standing right under it. All in all don't get this if you actually want it to keep you warm like a propane heater. The ups are that we dont have an outdoor light and this fell into the same price range as an outdoor lamp (actually cheaper). Its not super bright but gives off a nice glow so we can see (similar to candle light) outside at night and not be in the dark. It also doesn't need to be filled like a gas patio heater and it won't violate some fire codes (NYC you can't have any gas grills, heaters etc) but it certainly won't ease the cold.Pros: Reasonably priced out door light, doesn't use a lot of energyCons: Barely gives off any heat at full blast"
4,Wonderful Game!,"I have an ME computer and I had some problems installing and playing the game. But as soon as the game got going, it was so much fun and impossible to stop!! The goal of the classic game is to pop as many balloons as you can and win tokens. The puzzle game is a little frustrating, and takes some thought. The action game is very fun and is addicting!!! It is all balloon popping and is a fairly simple, yet fun, game to play."
4,Just enough CVS to keep you moving,"If you are new to a particular topic and there is a Pragmatic Bookshelf edition for it, then I wholeheartedly recommend buying a copy before you buy any alternate version. They are generally well written, up-to-date and tell you just the stuff that you really need to know. This book is exactly that. There is a lot of information and books around on CVS version control tool but this is the one that well get you going the quickest."
2,Better than nothing,With this book at my side I still ended up frequently hunting for information out on the web. CVS looks at the entire concept quite a bit differently than the other SCMs I've used and the command line interface is archaic. This book fails to provide a good conceptual model of what is going on in CVS (as opposed to SCMs in general) which might be able to allow using CVS without resorting to a purely cookbook approach.The book only briefly deals with the GUI interfaces that might be an improvement over the command-line approach. Those that they do mention are Windows only.
5,Cheap and effective,"Used these to cool the backside of my 4870x2. My 4870x2 is a parallel-to-the-floor mount, so these just sit on the memory modules thanks to gravity. They haven't moved, but I haven't tested their security. They transfer heat well enough and for this price, that's quite good. All of my heatsinks came as the low-rise ones with fins going at angles, not that it matters to me."
5,Very nice and effective,"Stuck those in the memory chips of my video card, and they become hot like the chips, which means the heat transfer it excellent.I found a box of these at a local retailer, and while the package said it had 4 tall and 4 short ones, they were all short ones, which was my preference anyway so I could fit these under the card's cooler which had very little clearance. They fit really well on my Asus EN9500GT graphics card.I also combined these with an Antec ""Spot Cool"" fan (ASIN B000I5KSNQ)with amazing results."
3,Eran necesarios??,"Los compré pero nunca evalué su aporte a refrigerar la tarjeta de video. No tenía tiempo para hacer esta prueba y no quería que correr el riesgo, así que le conseguí un disipador más potente a la tarjeta de video y estos disipadores"
2,Factory Defect,"The predrilled threaded holes for the legs to the top were misaligned. I had to go to home depot and get some wood screw and do it myself.All in all its a sturdy good looking table, or I wouldnt have given it two stars."
4,Put on your critical thinking hat!,"At first glance, this book seems like a simple rite-of-passage tale: young boy goes across the street to commune with gorgeous women and learn about sex and nail polish, or some such thing.If you look deeper, however, it becomes clear that the journey depicted by LaFerriere is one of political discovery as well. ""Papa"", a seemingly minor chartacter, lurks in the background, somewhat menacing and completely disinterested in the drama surrounding him. While women kick, scream, yell, and turn on each other viciously, ""Papa"" (representing Haitian Dictator Duvalier) hardly looks up, hardly notices, does nothing when asked to intervene.Read this way, the book offers insight into the burgeoning political mind of a young man in a terribly beautiful, terribly corrupt place."
2,Misleading Title,"Allright, the catchy title (referring to Papa Doc Duvalier of Haiti) and cool cover enticed me into buying this slim, unsatisfying book. Apparently functioning as a sequel to the highly autobiographical ""An Aroma of Coffee,"" it nominally follows one teenage boy's weekend in early 1970s Port-au-Prince. In actuality, the boy mostly functions as an observer of the whirlwind lives of a group of fine young women who live across the street from him. This is reflected by the more apt ordinal French title, which translates to ""The Taste/Appetite of Young Girls."" Theses women are a fairly unpleasant, nasty, catty, backstabbing lot, and are fairly hard to tell apart. Written as a series of scenes, the book conveys some atmosphere of the time, but not enough to make it worthwhile."
2,History,If you are a fan of the airline industry the early part of this book will prove interesting. The latter half is a academic treatise on architectural design and it is boring to a layman.
5,Inspirational,"This was a great read. The chapters started with a brief exerpt from ""The Prince"" and continued to have deep discusion on the relationship to modern business. This will be a book that I frequently reference the numerous highlights I made of insightful and motivational topics."
1,Not worth reading,"I found this book to be wholly absent of any kind of meaningful discussion of political behavior in the commercial environment. It provides a very cursory, feeble projection and application of Machiavelli's principles in a business context. A disappointing job at what could have been a powerful, interesting and timely discussion."
3,Decent couple of horror films,"These old PC Treasures boxes have no real packaging; the sleeveless DVD is attached to the inside of the cardboard box. Other examples of the series includeTales of the Undead: Atom Age Vampire / Revolt of the Zombies,Nightmares: Bloodlust! / Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street, andThreshold of Terror: Bluebeard / House on Haunted Hill.The good news is that the print quality is actually pretty good on these DVDs, and the movies range from decent to good. They're presented in a drive-in double feature format with an ancient cartoon in the middle.Note that despite what's written on the box, Chills does not include a Magic Mummy cartoon. Instead, it's Mechanical Man (1932), featuring Oswald the Lucky Rabbit.These are all public domain titles, so you can probably surf around and find them. But for pretty good prints presented in a friendly way, this isn't that bad if you can get it cheap."
3,One of the strangest things I've read,"Personally I think Picasso should have stuck just to painting.This play is very wierd. It includes a gigantic sphere that rolesonto and off the stage at regular intervals. I don't know if it was ever performed, it would be interesting to watch. Its strangeness makes it funny. END"
5,the perfect underwear for my husband,These are the only underwear my husband will wear! And he's not a picky man. They are very soft and hold up well wash after wash. Definitely worth the money!
1,bad service,i never got the item yet they still charged me. i was told by email to call them but got the run around when no one would answer. I wouldnt recommend this item due to them having poor service and i didnt even get my item.
3,Different Questions inside,The questions in this book differ from the second edition book sold at the bookstore ! But good enough book for practice.
2,Looks don't last forever....,"This is a nice looking bird feeder....and it keeps the squirrels at bay. But beware...in about 6 months the pretty panes of glass (the roof) will fall off. The birds will still come, but the pretty part is no more."
5,Great Spatula,Love the spatula. I am looking into getting another one that is larger. Use it all the time. It came before they said it would too.
3,a little lightweight,"We usually use Ateco spatulas at the bakery, but decided to try this brand. It's a little thinner and a touch shorter than the Ateco spatula, but in some ways, that could be an good thing."
2,GERMANSONGS,"Disappointing -- should be redone or discarded -- loaded with rabble-rousing communist (think Thaelmann, etc), left-wing(Red Wedding, The Proletariat, etc), ""anti-fascist"" (DDR anthem, etc). Contains some medevial songs of historical interest, and a few children's and obscure religous songs -- a useful (to Germanophile Americans) total of perhaps ten percent of the pages.No political balance -- nothing from the Nazi score -- even tho some is popular even today. Even ""Lili Marlene"" is excluded!Aside from ""Annchen--"", nothing of the many German songs popularized today in the worldwide Andre Rieu concerts.In summary -- junk. Not worth keeping -- and a ripoff -- giving mine to trashcan or the town library sales."
3,"It's okay, as far as...","bird feeders go. It looked prettier online than up close and personal, but it functions fine for small birds. Larger birds, like Mourning Doves will eat the seed that falls to the ground."
1,cheaply made,The squirrels nocked this feeder apart the first day. It's lightweight and flimsy construction relegated it to the trash already.
2,Replacing this one too soon!,"I liked this feeder just fine until something happened with the fasteners. The plastic top connects to the feeder by twisting it onto tabs on the feeder and they lock onto the top. For no good reason, the tabs do not line up with the top and will not lock on now. Everything looks fine, but they do not connect. I even broke a tab off trying to get the thing to lock down. I have had this feeder for only a few months and am replacing it already."
3,Feeds birds and squirrels,"This feeder looks great hanging from a tree in the garden but whoever decided to select it as a ""squirrel proof"" bird feeder never met my squirrels. It took them only two days to figure out how to ""hang"" from the feeder top (upside down, mind you) while ""stealing"" sunflower seeds. Even the safflower seeds which they aren't supposed to like didn't stop them!"
3,"Great, when not broken","Good looking for humans and birds. Easy to fill , except that the tray has broken twice while filling in cold weather."
5,An excellent piece of historical fiction,"I've taught this book to 6th and 7th graders at two different schools. Both years, it was one of my students' favorite books. There is plenty of action to keep readers interested, and the story deals well with the issue of slavery. Another excellent book in this same genre--though a little more challenging--is ""Amistad"" by Alexs Pate."
4,"The Captive, with twists and turns","In the book The Captive, the plot line takes many twists and turns that can be sad, or can be full of action. It takes its first twist when Kofi Kwame Paul, the main character, witnesses his father and brother get shot by their betraying servant, Oppong. This event causes Kofi and his other brother, Kwesi, to be left with a slave trader. The slave trader allowed Kofi to prove his brother and himself a part of the royal Ashanti family. On this mission Kofi finds himself escaping from a trading post he went to to get his flute back. He was caught and sent on a ship to Salem, MA with African slaves. When he arrived there it was to his misfortune that he had become a slave to a farmer. After working there he ran away to Boston, MA with the other slaves to have freedom. Although the twists and turns seem to lead somewhere different, it all ends up in one place."
5,A book you should read and buy,"This is a cool book because you can imagine how the main character,Kofi, really feels. It talks about how a son of the Ashanti chief, Kofi, was caught and sold as a slave again and again. In the end, Kofi met two American boy and learnt English. But, the bad part about this book is; you don't want to stop! It was fun to read this book and learn about the things Kofi encountered and the Ashanti culture."
4,Only relevant if your puppy is really young (before 8 weeks),"If you have a dog who is over 8 weeks, you might not get the most out of this product. This book starts when the dog is very young. I bought it when my dog was about 12 weeks old and it seemed like I missed a lot of the developmental periods the books talk about. If you have a young dog though (8 weeks at the oldest), then this book is amazing for them! Trainers recommended it to me."
5,"Timely, no problems","I had already had an opportunity to work with the puppy tool kit and wanted to get it for a friend. Delivery was timely, the box was a little bent up despite the air wrap, but it wasn't a problem. I'd recommend both the product and seller."
5,A great source for puppy training and socialization,"I like this toolkit because it includes lots of pictures and step by step instructions on puppy training, as well as great puppy training games. It also includes an extensive checklist for socializing your puppy so you can easily make sure nothing is left out."
5,"St Joseph Weekday Missal, Vol 2 Pentecost to Advent","I am a visual person, and find I get much more out of the daily Mass readings when I can both hear and read them. The wording is slightly different than the new lectionary, but I prefer the missal reading as it does not use inclusive language."
1,"Sold ""old"" edition Missal as ""new edition""","This is the ""old Missal"" from Vatican 2, which they conveniently did not say intheir ad. It was cheap, but worth NOTHING. The shipping and handling is whereit is at for them, and we still had to pay that. We were taken advantage of."
4,A Good Read For Laker Fans,"A good book, although I started skipping through the last third of it - too bad there wasn't more info on the Minneapolis Lakers version and the early 70's West-Chamberlain-Goodrich Lakers - it would've been nice to read more about personalities on those Laker teams - there was already enuff media saturation with the Kobe-Shaq Lakers so i started to skip thru that section. Seems kind of sad that everyone didn't have the foresight (and media saturation) like we do now, to save every lil scrap and every piece of info, so we can have a better perspective on how things were then."
4,A book for Laker Fan,This book about my favorite sports team was so informative. I learned about their humble beginnings all the way up until the 00's. Just a good read for a good price. Recommended for the Laker fan who wants to know more about the team. Lazenby did a good job on the Jerry West book as well.
2,"Micheal is good, but YouTube is better","I hate to say not to buy this video. But, the quality of the video is much worse than the YouTube videos that are available for free by bitymoldsupply. I would like to think that buying a DVD would offer ""premium"" content -- but that is simply not true in this case. Though individually shorter, the YouTube videos seem to have more detail and are much less monotonous than this DVD."
4,Most of the book is not about pricing and estimating,"The title doesn't really describe this book. Two of the 14 chapters pertain to pricing and estimates, but don't expect a GAG PEG-style list of suggested numbers. In fact, actual fees are seldom mentioned.This book mostly covers the business of graphic design, from hiring to self promo to client relations. If you're getting the Creative Business newsletter, you're already getting this information. If not, this is a practical guide. Williams is experienced, and her advice makes good sense. Her writing style is casual, and the book is a quick read."
4,Be or not to be - in a business of visual comm,I found this book a very useful inside info for all freshmen who are still considering going on the market themselves or for those who are expanding business of design into full service with organizing all the basic non-creative processes. Nice plain and practical explanations. For seniors in the business its almost like when we pool out our own old photo album and some memories come back to us ...
5,Malcolm in the Middle season 2,The music companys are really stupid cause the movies and series are FREE ads for the music. I can't tell you how many times I have bought cd's from hearing it on the show or movies. Wake up!!!
3,MIM for uk,just release the show in the uk we have not got season 1 yet let alone season 2 and it should be released on blu ray not dvd just release the show if i was a millionaire i would give the producer the money because of the bluddy music any one els aggre to releasing the show on blu ray
5,Great Series,"I never watched this series when it was new, but I am really enjoying it now.I am looking forward to Season 3."
1,Available in the UK,"Yes, it sucks that Season 2 onwards isn't available in the USA.BUT.Get a Region-free DVD player now, and put away your pennies for shipping costs, because Season 2 has been released in the UK, with subsequent seasons to follow. (Amazon UK claims Season 3 will be released in February 2013 and 4 in March.Ironically, I'm in Asia, not the USA, and Amazon UK actually charges me less for international shipping than Amazon US, so in a way, this works out better for me.Whatever it may be, I'm sure everyone will just be glad that we're finally seeing the rest of this amazing series on home video."
3,Which music prevent it?,"Which music prevent it to come out?Cna somebody please tell, so i can boycoyt the msucians preventing this coming out."
1,Just Release the GD Thing Without the Original Music!!!,"They did it with the complete series of ""Daria"" and while, yes, that show isn't exactly the same it's going to be the only way this show will ever make it to DVD!Now, with that problem fixed, when's the rest of ""King of the Hill"" coming out?"
1,I must dissapoint you,"I'm sorry to dissapoint you, but because of music rights disputes, the second season will most likley stay ureleased for the remainder of our lifetime."
5,Another show Fox has screwed up...,"In my opinion, two of the greatest shows ever to air were Arrested Development and Firefly, both on Fox. However, Fox managed to destroy these two shows in the prime of their young lives at season three for Arrested Development, and season one for Firefly.Now, a show that Fox allowed to prosper and grow, Malcolm in the Middle, is fading away since there are no additional DVD sets available since season one. Why, Fox, do you do this to such great shows? I shudder every time I hear a show that I'm interested in is going to be aired on Fox, since I know that Fox will do everything in their power to pull the plug way too early."
4,Sent quickly and in good shape!,"There are several of these with the same name.Although it was not the one I expected, it is still good and arrived promptly and in good shape."
1,Even the ICR rejected ths movie!,"Some years back I telephoned the Institute for Creation Research in Santee, California. They told me they no longer advocated the film In Search of Noah's Ark on the grounds it contained too much misinformation. This says a lot when a young earth creationist institute rejects a creationist film for being too misinformative. Those YEC's are so rightfully notorious for misquoting scientists themselves and distorting facts like crazy that for them to reject a creationist work shows how bad the latter work must be.This film leaves one with the totally false impression that archaeologist Leonard Wooley in the 1920's found a flood that covered the entire world. Actually Wooley's discovered flood-remains didn't even cover the entire ancient city he was excavating THUS IT SURE DIDN'T COVER THE WHOLE WORLD! Other misinformation abounds. Forget it!"
5,KICK AXE IV Rocks!!,"For anyone who has not heard this album they are truly missing probably one of the best albums of the year. This band from Canada rocks. This CD would be a great addition to anyone's rock n roll collection. Twenty years ago this band from Canada released it's debut album called Vices which was a very successful album.Now the band is back with their original singer Gary Langen, and ready to go back on the road to rock. For most people that have not seen Kick Axe live here is your oppurtunity to hear the bands new material before you see them live. Live they are a great act that I highly recommend to go and see.I have seen them ever since the bands roots in 1976 and seen every version of the band since and look forward to seeing all of the original members of this great musical act from Canada."
2,Big Disappointment,"WARNING. This is nothing like Vices. If you liked Vices, you will not like IV. Not sure why all these reviewers have given it five stars. It does not rock. It is boring. It is now a coaster."
4,love the product,"I bought this for my friend who just moving into her new home,not only her but everybody seem very impress."
2,Hard to handle,This cast iron apple is adorable but its small base makes it top heavy and its shallow handles make it difficult to lift and position when it is hot. Be careful lifting the cover with an unprotected hand or you might get burned by the blast of steam as my daughter did. Although it is very attractive it is not ergonomically designed. I have enjoyed looking at it on my stove but I think twice before cooking in it.
5,Super cute and functional,This pot is adorable and great for cooking too. I actually sit it in our bedroom when not in use - we have a small apartment! So far I have cooked a slow-simmered chili and made a seafood chowder in it and it has worked great. I have a much larger cast-iron (not enamelled) dutch oven and this smaller size is pretty handy to have around. I got this on sale - it seems to regularly go on sale - and am very happy with it.
4,Nice!,"Nice even heating of food, nice size. Would give it a 5 but the stem is a little loose. It does not seem like it will fall off but a little scary when lifting off and on the lid"
2,disappointed in the extreme,"I bought the soundtrack with the hope that the best song on the movie - the bagpipes version of Amazing Grace at the end of the film - would be on it. It is not.If your objective is to get that bagpipe song, don't get the CD. the other songs are ok, but nothing to write home about."
3,Amazing Grace MIA,"While the score is very nice, the main reason for purchase was the wonderfully powerful rendition of ""Amazing Grace"" during the closing credits. It is NOT on the CD! How could they do this? The signature piece is missing in action (MIA)??!! Very disappointing, to say the least."
1,Rip Off,"Amazing Grace is a great movie and the CD is a rip off. The song Amazing Grace is a key part of the film and a key part of the score, including the bagpipe version at the end. Yet the song is not a part of the CD. Sleazy! Mis-leading!! A travesty to the memory of William Wilbeforce, a man of honor and integrity. It only gets one star because you have to rate it. If anybody wants my copy, let me know. I'll ship it at no charge."
2,No Amazing Grace?!,"Okay so check it out. The title of this inspired and beautiful movie is Amazing Grace. The story ends, appropriately enough, with the most gorgeous version you'd ever want to hear of, you guess it, Amazing Grace! I just watched the movie. Loved it and couldn't wait to order the soundtrack so I could relive that amazing bagpipe/band rendition of Amazing Grace at the end. But no! It's not on the CD! What dingbat had his/her brain in a hole when THAT decision was made? What a travesty."
1,Amazing Grace,I bought this CD for Amazing Grace being played by the Bagpipes which was played during the credits at the end of the movie. The CD does not have this on the CD. A list of the songs would have been usefull before purchase
4,Amazing calm,"While it is disappointing that there is no reference to ""Amazing Grace"" anywhere on this CD, that is not enough for me to give it poor marks for beauty and atmosphere. I am surrounded by machines emitting white noise to the point that I can't work for the distracting sounds. I use CDs in my computer to ""cover"" the sound and this is one of my favorites ... nothing in it to make words begin to run through my head while I'm working but lovely, calming music that helps me to concentrate on even the most miserable paperwork."
1,not what I wanted,"Not happy at all. I was looking for the music I heard when I watched the movie. You'd think that the soundtrack of ""Amazing Grace"" would actually have the 2 versions of ""Amazing Grace"" sung and played during the movie on it. All this disc has is background music. Now that I have opened the disc, I cannot return it. I would like to have the songs played during the movie. Any idea what I need to buy??"
2,The Title Song Sounds Low-Quality,"While we enjoyed all of the music in this beautiful film, the reason we bought the soundtrack was to have that amazing version of ""Amazing Grace"" that comes at the end of the film. The first release of the soundtrack didn't have that song at all, and there were a lot of complaints about that. The producers of this CD added ""Amazing Grace,"" but the quality of that track is noticeably lower-quality sound than the rest of the CD. We were greatly disappointed. If you're buying to get the majestic bagpipes and drums, you'll do better just recording it yourself with a microphone in front of your DVD player speakers the next time you watch the movie."
4,def. amaz.,I am a writer and I love mvies. This soundtrack goes with a wonderful movie and is such a good score to write to. Definately amazing.
2,"A quality performance, but recording is of limited quality.","Note: I only downloaded the Chichester Psalms portion of this.The performance quality is high. Echoing what Mr. Merrick had to say, the tempo is fast, giving the music an even more frantic sense that it usually has. The conductor has really just amplified what Bernstein provided: Things certainly slow down when they need to.So why am I only giving 2 stars for a quality performance? The quality of the recording sucks. I don't know if it was somehow muddled during the encoding process, but the chorus sounds as though they are performing from inside a well. The focus seems to be on Mr. Jones, who comes through quite well along with the harp. But that's not even 1/4 of the piece, and the remainder is left muddled and confused."
4,"Awesome book, but...","Its a great book, very very specific and with lots of details on the history and dates. The only recommendation i will give to any possible buyer is: it is NOT a easy book to read, it has many names(of persons and places), many dates, very specific information that if you just are just looking for an overview of the history this is not the book. Besides that, its a great compilation of Buddhist history . Enjoy."
3,Personal Review For Music Projects With Propellerhead Reason,"I found this book very interesting as it shows the basic setup stages of ""Propellerhead Reason 3"" As I am a professional in music production, I found some of the infomation a bit to basic and not really what I was looking for. On the other hand it helped me with a few confusions but other than that, I more or less already know what to do within ""Propellerhead Reason 3!"" I think this book is very good and therefore is a good start for beginners in the electronic music scene, however it can also help out the odd pro with one or two things that you might have not known!"
5,The Greatest,"Suzy Bogguss is one of the greatest country singers around. Her voice is haunting and material top notch. Don't miss a chance to hear or, better yet, see her in person."
2,Panama Travel Guide,"Too---- much small detail and not enough maps, pictures and history. The print could of been a little bigger. This book would of been fine if you were going to move there. For a short visit, way to much information."
5,"A ""user friendly"" and informative guide ideal for the casual tourist and the dedicated business traveler alike","Panama: The Bradt Travel Guide is a superb in-depth travel guide, packed cover to cover with everything from where to view more than 350 species of bird to fishing, rafting and hiking opportunities, prime beaches and watersport locations, top-rated locations to stay or eat, the history of the Panama Canal, an extensive focus on Bocas del Toro, and much more. On a less lighthearted note, Panama: The Bradt Travel Guide also covers ""need-to-know"" information concerning common diseases, what to bring in a first aid kit, natural hazards, and locations that are particular hotbeds of crime or danger. Maps, charts, graphs, and a handful of photographs round out this practical-minded, ""user friendly"" and informative guide ideal for the casual tourist and the dedicated business traveler alike."
1,Not for Men,"I wanted to try a travel guide other than Lonely Planet, but after skimming this guide by Sarah Woods I went back to Lonely Planet. This book contains too much useless information and is poorly formatted. The worst is when she says that she does not include budget hotels because she is a lone female traveler, because she fears for her safety. I can see her point, but I am a man and don't have these safety fears. This book should be titled ""Panama for Women."" I guess she is not going to write a travel guide for Cambodia any time soon? This is the first time, in a long time, that I feel ripped off buying a book."
1,Please consider Ms Ruby's credibility...,"I first read interpretations of end-times prophecy when I was in high school (20+ years ago!) I read the Left Behind series largely because Tim LaHaye has been a well-known and respected prophecy scholar for many years. I first became acquainted with his writing & speaking in the 1970's, and in my opinion, he has passed the test given in Scripture to judge a man by his actions & not just words. Ms Ruby, on her website, states she was saved in 1982, worships at home because she hasn't found a church ""God gives us leave to join"", and says that LaHaye & Jenkins ""twist"" the prophecy, while she ""twists"" what they have said in the books. Please consider carefully who is more credible!"
1,Slander at its worst!,"If this author is the Christian she says she is, she should know that she is sinning much more by spreading lies about servants of God, than are the authors of LB by writing their books. If she really read and analyzed the series with the Bible, she'd find out just how close they are. True, no one can describe the end-times events exatcly how they will happen, but the Bible gives us a pretty good idea. The LB series is FICTION, but it's the clearest portrayal of prophecy yet. That's precisely why the secular world finds it so appealing. They can finally understand prophecy! Please do not waste your time with this book. You want the truth? Read the BIBLE. Period."
1,God's Wrath on left behind,Lisa Ruby needs to get a life or a job. Slandering other author's work in order to make herself an extra buck is really not cool. If she really dislikes the Left Behind books she could write her own end times books according to here own wishes without trying to destroy other author's reputation. Saying that Tim Lahaye and Jerry Jenkins is in league with the devil as so to speak is below the belt. I give God's Wrath 1 star because unfortunatly I can't give it no stars. The book ought to be banned and Lisa Ruby's work should never be published agian.....
1,Author needs to focus on bigger matters...,"Lisa needs to focus her critism on some ministries who lead people astray. They are the most dangerous to a Christian then the Left Behind Series. Why not investigate those churches that have been very reluctant to talk about the coming of Jesus's Christ?Or about Jesus and his minstry? Or God's goodness and mercy? Or what does it take to be saved and what must they do next?It appears that some ministries have been putting their focus on teaching on financial prosperity (how to obtain physical things) and the Christian's duty to tithe. (perhaps appeasing the majority?). We owe God for his goodness and mercy, not the other way around. Are these ministries blind to the signs of the times?Sounds like Lisa needs to focus her attention to bigger matters and perhaps give us a book on exposing the anti-christ agenda on those ministries who fail to acknowledge the coming of Christ."
4,Good introduction to unit testing,This book is very good for a beginner to unit testing. I like the simple explanation of the different types of unit testing that must be done. This really helps a beginner to make sure that the tests are comprehensive.Also it clarifies the intention behind use of mock objects. I would use the concepts in this book as a checklist to make sure the tests are written to cover all types of problems.I gave 4 star only because it contains toy examples and does not go into too much detail on this very important topic. JUnit Recipes contains more realistic examples.
4,Not only about JUnit,"When I was learning about JUnit I picked this book and as it turned out, it was pretty good choice. I didn't learn only about JUnit, but also about the core principles of unit testing. Style was very understandable, examples nice, and length was just good enough.It's quite obsolete now and you should be probably looking for JUnit 4.x based book. But if you work with more JUnit 3 based legacy code, it's still pretty good choice."
2,Not very pragmatic,"I have decided never to buy another programming book with ""Pragmatic"" in the title. If you are a TDD enthusiast, who loves being told what you already believe, you may enjoy it. If you are totally ignorant of any testing discipline you may even learn something from it. What you will not learn is how to use JUnit to test your code."
4,Satisfactory Product,"Item arrived vacuum sealed, I unrolled it and unfolded it to air it out as I've read these mattress toppers tend to have an oder but there was no oder. It seemed to not fully expand in the places where it was folded but laying on it I can't tell. It's about 2 inches narrower than a regular queens size bed. The cover is a paper thin polyester cover, so it really won't help with breathability. It won't helpI purchased this item because I went too cheap on my mattress and I thought this would help compensate. My bed now feels very very soft. I'm not sure I really like sleeping on such a soft bed. It's also now kind of hot, I think getting a decent mattress cover to put under my fitted sheet might help."
2,smell and free pad UPDATED SAME DAY,"*** posted same day. 7:35PM. Company contacted me the same day, how is that for fast response. They are sending a new different mattress pad to replace the defective one. I can't believe a company acted so fast and so promptly. I have never had such a positive response for a company. Thank you !!!! ALL SLEEPRec'd order fast. The pad has a strong smell, have had outside for 2 days trying to air out. Forget the free mattress pad, it fell apart as we were putting on. It was not to small, did not take a lot of pulling and tugging to get on but every corner tore, out fingers went right through it, then as we were trying to adjust sides elastic pulled off. I am glad it was free but if I had pad $00.01 for this it would have been to much. Hope the smell goes away."
1,volume is way too low,"Just like the other user, the volume of the radio is way too low. I can barely hear what's on the radio in a shower."
1,Should be illegal to sell to the public!,"I bought this product for my daughter. Although it was a cheap item, it also reflects the product's function. I guess I got what I paid for. With the volume knob all the way up, the music can barely be heard. That is with the shower OFF. With the shower on, the music cannot be heard at all! Thus, this item should be illegal to be sold on the market. This is the first time I've purchased a shower radio, so don't know how the sound is supposed to be, but the music is so distorted from the worthless speakers, that even with the shower off, it is hard to understand what is coming over the radion. Sounds like blown out speakers."
3,good stuff for crash dieters,"Its supposedly an aid to a 2 day crash diet course, the instructions says ""Do not consume food, alcohol or caffine"".I was alright on day one but I gave in on the 2nd day and gorged twice the food i usually eat.Perhaps this is not meant for ill disciplined people like me. :(I gave it 4 stars cos its delicious and I lost 3 pounds even when I didnt follow instructions. I will buy to attempt again."
2,hollywood somemore,i say hollywood somemore because i think it should had been a little more powerful being that the stares was surpose to be thin from taking this product.
3,not true size,be careful! i took meassures of my knee but it was not true to its sizeeverything else looks just fine
1,Fell Apart in Less Than 60 Days,"I have had good luck with this product in the past, but the latest one tore apart at one of the seams. It was used for maybe 50 hours of exercise. Because Amazon does not allow returns after 30 days, I am out of luck, and out $12."
3,A bit dissapointed,"I painstakingly read reviews with a bid to ensure that I ordered just the right size. Measured my knee circumference and along with the reviews I read finally settled on ordering LARGE. When I received it however it was not the best fit. On top of that after working out or walking around for a while in it, it begins to slip down as I sweat, thereby rendering it ineffective in carrying out its function. I'm in Jamaica so returning it is not even an option for consideration. maybe the MEDIUM would have been the ideal choice for my 16"" circumference..."
3,Sizes Run Bigger,"I had leg surgery a few months ago, so I bought one of these to help support my knee through the recovery process. I am rather petite, so I bought a small, which said 11-13 inches. I recieved it today and when I tried it on, the thing swallowed my leg. When I read the sizes on the back of the packaging it said, Small 12-14 inches. I decided to let my mom(about 5""7, skinny) try it on, because she has occasional knee pain in her right knee, and the brace fit her perfectly. So I just gave it to her to use. All in all, the brace is good quality, but be careful about which size you get."
3,Nice Product,"Item does not appear to have much elasticity, and has fair compression. Seems to run slightly smaller in same size when compared to other brands. I find the bottom portion a bit binding (my legs are not large) and solved the issue by rolling it over slightly at the botton. I've had it on a few hours without any appreciable discomfort, and find it comfortable (without irritation or scratching) against my skin. Not bad for the price."
3,"Good support, but the seams came loose.","I'm an active 48 year old male and I purchased two of these knee support strap for my doubleheader softball games and normal workouts. They were working very well, but after just six weeks, the seams on one of them came completely apart. I don't know if I can get it replaced and I'm a little reluctant to purchase this product again."
4,Very Pleased,The Product was even better than expected. The support and comfort was very good. I would recommend this product very highly.
1,Sizes are not correct,"I measured my knee and ordered the xxl brace.The brace isn't the same as their sizing chart.Its also much shorter then the picture. Very misleading.Now to return it, I have to loose more money for shipping.DO NOT BUY!"
2,Sizing is small,"The reason I gave this product 2 stars is because I had to return it because it was to small. My only advise to big guys like myself is measure like I did and if you are borderline on the high end of measuement shy away from this product. The quality looked ok, I just couldn't use it."
1,Wonder why this is released now,"If Nostradamus had predicted about WTC attacks 500 years ago, why was this movie not made earlier to Sep 11?Either way, this movie is useless.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY - DONATE THE SAME MONEY TO ANY WTC FUND."
1,totally unacceptable,"The product arrived half empty and damaged.AFTER REPEATED REQUEST FROM aMAZON AND THE COMPANY THEY FAILED TO SENS REPLACEMENT.We are totally dissatisfied and may never order from Amazon againThe product only cost 7.99,but it is a matter of principle!"
1,"Unsatified - I still have not received an undamage ""Cuticle Eliminator""","Unsatisfied - I still have not received an undamaged ""Cuticle Eliminator.""Tracie Fisher: - Natural Cuticle Eliminator Remover Softner Skin 2 Oz"
2,Limited Value,"The gaps in the mesh allow something with a diameter of 8.5cm (3 1/3 inch) to pass through, camera lenses, camera bodies, mp3 players and mobile phones will pass straight through."
5,The Very Best of Christian Music,"I've seen Rebecca St. James twice in concert and have loved her music and ministry. This cd and dvd bring it home with the spirit and energy of the live concert.The songs include praise and worship songs and songs about relationships (the kind you want your family to hear) and ""Lion"" that refers to Aslan from the Narnia series (a favorite of my young daughter.)I think Rebecca's music here will satisfy the tastes of any who appreciate up-tempo music with Christian lyrics. These songs are as good as any you would hear in today's pop culture and the lyrics are full of positive messages.We have also enjoyed watching the dvd and listening to it at home. The songs are great for the ipod and the car.Shakespeare On Spirituality: Life-Changing Wisdom from Shakespeare's Plays"
2,?,"I didn't understand this book at all. Maybe you will, but I can't reccommend it at all. I can't say anything bad, since he is a colleague of mine, but whatever.GO RED SOX!"
4,Love it,"This is great. I only wish that it would continue to play all 5 episodes. Unlike the 1st dragontales DVD, after an episode plays, it goes back to the menu instead of playing all 5 continuously."
5,Adorable Buckwheat,This adorable photograph reproduction of popular Our Gang star Buckwheat would be a wonderful piece of memorabilia to adorn your wall. Buckwheat's startled expression and miss-spelled engineer hat are staples of the series. Do not miss this wonderful collectable item to show off your interest in the series.
4,Mid genre country,"Not considered classic country and surely not new country this occupies an excellent mid era that encompasses such artists as Doug Stone, Hal Ketchum, Deana Carter and many more.Compilation of a group that produces harmony and lyrical genius that anyone can enjoy, i must admit this takes me back to a younger and simpler time and never fails to provide enjoyment.If you aren't a fan of this mid range country you may still enjoy some of these songs and its worthwhile to listen."
1,Defective CD,"I have to agree with the previous review, this CD is defective. It finishes one song and then starts to play the first few notes of the next song, pauses for about 5 seconds, and then continues. Don't get me wrong, I love Restless Heart, have listened to them for years and have several cassettes. I wanted them on CD so I could put them on my Ipod... I won't put THIS on it. It would drive me nuts. What a shame. And shame on whoever is responsible for putting this CD together."
1,Not a great compilation of their best hits,"Can anybody explain how ""Til I Loved You"" got left out of this compilation? Where is ""Wheels""? I think ""Mending Fences"" would have made more sense than the inclusion of the last two songs. Save your money and download the tunes you want from elsewhere - this cd isn't worth the price, and is hardly all of Restless Heart's greatest hits."
1,Poor quality,They don't fit well and stick to your feet. Whatever you do don't get them wet as the colour comes out and then you leave black footprints all over the house!
5,They are worth perserverance,"Cankermelts do take a bit of getting used to, but I can now get them to stick almost anywhere - you just have to keep trying. It's worth it because they really do start to heal the ulcer within a couple of days. Like more than half the reviewers, I think they've made my life better. I can't understand why it's taken so long for medical research to produce a modest 'cure' for something so painful that affects millions of people."
1,Cankermelts,I just got these from the dentist and tried these and let me tell you..... they are terrible! I tried to get them to stick to my mouth and they didnt. I read the instructions then tried it again and the same thing happened! This is not a good poduct and i would not recommend this product. Dont waste your money on it.
4,Work well but uncomfortable,"I was so excited about purchasing the Cankermelts, finally something to help my cankersores. But, I have only used it one time. They are so uncomfortable and weird feeling in my mouth that I have not used it again. It did seem to make it feel better, but I just don't use it."
5,Most effective treatment for canker sores!,"There is nothing more miserable that canker sores and if you have them, you know just what I mean. But this product truly shortens the length of time the sore is present and makes it more bearable in the meantime. It is the only thing I have found that works and I have tried everything!"
5,My test,I tested the cankermelts when they were being tried by people who have a lot of canker sores.I have found them very helpful in curing the sore very fast and much easier to use than any other product I have tried
2,Not terribly impressed,"The product is very difficult to get to stay in place. The directions call for constant contact of the product with the sore for at least 24 hours, which means reapplying the product many times per day. Plus, the product is unsightly if applied toward the front of the mouth - like black tar on your teeth. The product may in fact help to heal canker sores more quickly, and I hate to give a negative review, because there are so few options for canker sore sufferers like myself, but unfortunately, I did not find this product practical to use."
2,Watch the String,"My 7-year-old loves things that spin and things that fly, so he was very happy to receive this as a gift.I don't see how he can possibly pull the string hard enough to get the top to fly to a decent height or distance. Also, after only having the toy for 2 hours, the string became completely tangled inside. I unscrewed it and forced the pieces apart to fix the string, but he hasn't played with it much since then. There shouldn't be any way to have the string jam if you are playing with it properly, so I don't consider this very durable."
1,Wonder-ripoff,Is it cute? YES Is it interesting? YES Is it durable? Absolutely NOT. Within 24 hours the propeller cracked. Even after a tape job it exploded (fell apart). I soon had a 4 year old crushed. Come on MAttel I expected better out of you! I think you owe a lot of comsumers an apology. My advice? DON'T BUY IT!
1,The top will not STAY ON!,The toy is great for kids who loved the Robots movie if they have the patience to work with it a little. My 5 year old son thought it was great and loves anything that flies. The first few uses were great but now the top will not stay on long enough to launch it. It seems like there is a certain place it has to line up and we had three adults trying to explain to a lively five year old that you had to turn it a little and try it and turn a little and try it. Now he has of course abandoned it and my husband is using it to torment the cat.
2,BIG Disappointment,"We took my son to see the Robots movie and he loved it. His 6th birthday was not too long after that so we did a Robots themed party. He saw the Wonderbot in the store and had to have it. He was sooo excited about it. So I got it for him. Well, the first problem was that we couldn't get the top to stay on. Three adults tried thier hardest and none of us could get it to stay on. Then the next problem that came up was the string getting frayed. By the third day it was a goner. And my son was sooo upset cuz he loved that toy."
4,:),"Alanna McIntire's boss is a well known senator. The senator has always made his feelings known about Colonel Matt Breckenridge. Matt is the enemy and the man responsible for the death of the senators son. Now the senator is sending Alanna on a mission to investigate a black market operation headed up by the Colonel. Only once Alanna reaches Costa Rica and sees for herself the devestation from the earthquake and the compassion that Matt has for the people, she is torn between her duty to her job and her heart. Alanna knows that she will probably have to choose between her career and the man she loves, but she is unprepared for the fallout from both. This is the story of one woman's courage to stand up for what she believes in even if it means that she will lose everything."
2,A dull production,"This is a rather dull production. The singers are OK and whatever one thinks about Jerusalem, he's still a serviceable Siegfried. The other cast members are, however, mediocre and the direction is ordinary."
2,"is that you, siegfried?","I do really like Wagner's ""Ring Cycle"" but this particular segment doneby Jerusalem & Co. is, put bluntly,atrocious. I can't figure out why thecasting director (or whoever it is responsible) chose this guy Jerusalem to play and sing the hero of heroes--Siegfried. I would put him in someRossini opera, for he lacked the vocal and physical power of this Wagner hero. Excuse me, Mr. J.--no offense intended!"
5,Lots of fun!,"For anyone who appreciates the humor of a francophone like Henri Salvador and the culture he embraced, this collection of songs will not disappoint. One of the songs, the French rendition, ""Mais non, mais non"", is well known by English listeners of Muppet Show days of an original Italian composer's lyric ""Mahna, mahna""...Merci, Henri, pour une vie admirable!"
2,Ryobi Assembly Charger,"Had the unit for a few years and the charger burned out. I unscrewed the casing and the little circuit board was all fried. It seems a shame to throw away a perfectly usable screw gun and the two batteries for want of a cheapie battery charger. Granted, the screwgun is not the fasted or highest powered I've used, but for simple jobs around the house it gets the job done. Guess I have to shell, out $11.40 +2/h if I want to keep using it."
5,"So what if ""it doesn't sound like Negativeland""?","This is one of the tastiest things I've heard in ages and I'm only halfway through and listening on my PC tower's tiny speaker. If you are into disjunctive, a-musical and sometimes disturbing sounds, you ought to check this out. Women will blush and sweat; men will become tense and irritable. Yes, this is the real thing! About the closest thing I can compare it to is ""Agitation"" by Ilhan Mimaroglu (don't just sit there, Google it!). Buy it for that young niece or nephew who wears too much black and claims they are ""not addicted to the commonplace""."
5,Love these prenatals!,"I've researched just about every prenatal out there and these seem to be the most complete. Doctors prefer that you get a full gram of folic acid, but only 800mcg can be sold over the counter. Since this vitamin has two pills, one has 800mcg of folic acid and the other has 200mcg making a grand total of 1 gram! I take mine at night, but have not noticed any of the ""fishy burp"" that others talk about."
2,Disappointed,"Disappointed when I read the FDA list from 2007 and found out that these contain lead(read the information for yourself- google ""fda list of vitamins containing lead)In fact these ranked in the top ten highest for lead content.. AND these are prenatals! I was shocked that any vitamin company, especially Rainbow Light would do this to prenatals, but after further research I've discovered that most prenatal vitamins contain lead.I was also unhappy about the addition of soybean oil in the DHA supplement.Makes me question the other Rainbow Light products I use."
5,Great vitamins!,Easy on the stomach and the Dha pills have no fishy aftertaste. Have been taking for quite some time and I'm very pleased. Buy them!
5,Good prenatal supplement,"My doctor was impressed with the Rainbow Light ""Just Once Prenatal Vitamin"" when I showed her what I had been taking early on in my pregnancy. (I had tried some prescription versions and they usually made me feel sick, so I stuck with the Rainbow Light.) However, she recommended adding a DHA supplement to the vitamin. These DHA supplements are easy to swallow and don't leave an odd aftertaste like some vitamins do."
3,contains 200% vitamin E,"The prenatal tablet has 100% vitamin E and the DHA has 100% E as well. I am just worried that there will be excess vitamin E. Vitamin E will build up in your body. 9 month pregnancy is a long time. I wish there are no VitE in the DHA. A lot of other brands don't contains VitE in their DHA. I don't understand why Rainbow has to add VitE in their DHA softgel. To keep the shelf life longer? I will toss this one away and buy DHA from other brand. If amazon put the ingredient picture here, I won't buy this product"
4,Great for Pregnant Women,"I've ordered these three times now and I've been pleased with them two out of the three times. The first and last batch I received had a citrus smell, were tasetless and were easy to take. The second bottle had a fishy smell and you could taste the fishy taste when you swallowed the pills. The first and third bottles were great, though. Very easy to take as a pregnant woman with a strong gag reflex!"
3,BLEH. Smells like fish.,These have an orange essence smell to cover any fish odor but it doesn't work. They smell like fish and oranges.I HATE fish and therefore cannot tolerate these. Otherwise they seem good and the pill size of these softgels is smaller than most DHA/Omega 3 type of softgels. It's comparable to a Vitamin E softgel size if that helps.
1,vague information on the website,"The information in product feature says: 60 Soft Gels, TabletsBut Actually, it is 30 gels, and 30 tablets.I first found other providers selling the samething for a lower price, and then found this one. I thought it contains 60 gels and 60 tablets( thus i should be a great deal).The name (Two 30 count packs ) is also misleading, because it is actually 30 Ct pack as other prividers on Amazon sell.It was not the same as I thought at all. Disappointed.I do hope next time the seller is not going to provide such misleading information."
1,"if you don't live out west, don't order this book!","Got the book (pamplet)today and was totally disappointed. I live over 600 miles from the nearest place (Denver, Co) that is listed in this small (book?). I live in the Kansas City area and must travel forever to use this stupid map of old goldmines (which as anybody with brains knows are 'Private property'). I think the authors should tell the truth in the introduction (only written page in (book?))."
3,To Like or Not to Like,"Everyday for like, two weeks, I looked for this game in the mail, and when it finally came, I must say I was disappointed just by looking at the back. (Just a note, if you get the game and don't like how it looks on the back, you won't like the game)When I played it, everytime my horse ran, it lost. Whether it was third place or last place, they still lost. After about a year and a half of playing this game, I finally started a new barn, and the first horse I raced won!!!! I have to admitt, it was exciting. So, my reccommendation for this game is; if you don't like the back, you won't like the game."
2,Its not the Best,"This is a very fun game, but if you like awesome racing views and a variety of horse colors on a game as much as i do, this isnt your game. The horses come in 3 solid colors... boring.. no special views... boring... and worst of all NO BREEDING!!!!! Its not a very good game. Its sort of hard to understand, too"
1,People really believe this stuff,"After reading this for research for a paper, I didn't know whether to laugh or cry. The charts are laughable, and the scholarship is horrible."
1,where is the rating for ZERO starts?,"What happened to the Dirty Commies who were gonna end it all, Hal-Baby?As a Buddhist, I REALLY, REALLY TRY to have a live and let live approach to others' faith - I'd rather look for the ideas we have in common than engage in a theological slamfest. BUT...The entire ""End Times"" theology is a never-ending joke rehashed during every difficult period of western civilization over the last 1,000 years at least, and the fact that those who promote it seem intent on doing everything they can to bring it about is scary as all get-up. I really feel sorry for people who see their only means of salvation in the destruction of the world and the Billions of lives lost inherent in that proposition.Oh, I forgot...we don't have a CHOICE in this matter. Yeah, right, and the Jews are The Chosen People - just ask 'em!!!BWAHAHAHAHAHAHA !!!Gotta run now, and go try to make this world a better place to live.ZERO STARS."
1,"Very Rough, Thick Edges Could Irritate Baby's Skin - Unsable","Bought this - the fabric seems ok, but found that the leg openings with elastic rims are too corrugated, and very rough. One way of testing the irritation levels is to wrap the diapers over your arm - arm going through both leg openings - and rotate or move the diaper on/along your arm. I found the abrasion to be very harsh to my skin, and it would definitely be harsher on the baby's skin. So I washed it and dried it twice to see if the edges soften, but couldn't see a difference. So decided against using it. Found Kissaluv's cloth diapers much better around the leg openings."
5,LOVE these diapers!!,These are by far my favorite fitted EVER! Well worth the investment. My daughter and I are hugh fans. I would recommend this diaper to anyone!
4,Giallo obsessed?,"Crimes of the Black Cat is an overlook film in the ""giallo"" genre. Sometimes this genre tends to have trouble sticking to the plot and logic, but it's a movie not a documentary. While there are better films in the ""giallo"" genre (i.e. Lenzi's ""Orgasmo"", ""The Bird with the Crystal Plumage"", ""Blood and Black Lace"", ""Death Carries a Cane""), this one should be in your collection."
2,fine movie in horrible edition!,"It's really a shame to see such a good movie in this terrible edition! Image is muddy , grainy , distorted to match a 1.85 ratio...Especially disapointing as these Crimes of the Black Cat is a must-see giallo for connaisseurs...."
3,"Great Opening, Better Ending","And a lacking middle. The middle drew on, slowed the pace of the book and more or less ruined it for me. That is not to say that this was a bad book. It just wasn't a good one either.For a book that left the plot to the beginning and ending, it had terrible characters to sustain it through the slow middle. No one was particularly likeable, and almost all of them seemed completely unreal. Any moments of reality captured didn't include any of the characters.Female characters were particularly lacking in this novel. They had weak motivations and no real, clear voice.I felt like some of the ""minor"" characters were lacking in having their portion of the story told. All in all, this was entertaining enough, but it just wasn't they type of thing that I would say is a must-read, or even a if-you-have-the-time read."
4,"Strong, dark and just the right price","For solid, current drum'n'bass flavors from a label that's been giving it to us for years at a quality level, this little 10-tracker is a steal for the price they're selling it at. You can find it in a lot of local stores as well (even non-music stores), so there's no excuse not to try it.It's got some of the hard stuff if you're into that (Illform's ""Combustion Chamber"" and Hanna's ""Plague""), but has some more accessible stuff (the live band Droid's ""Adrenatone"" and Magnetic's ""Attrition""). With 2 tracks each from 5 very strong artists, the CD really can't go wrong. If you're into d'n'bass at ALL, you should get it. Has more flavor than the average compilation we've been seeing of late, and at this price (brand new!), you really, really can't go wrong. Fans have been spending 3 times that amount on similar items, only to find out it has half the solid tracks that Shadow's put on this disc."
4,tripping into darkness,"This was one of my bargan purchases I bought this for the price, previously having no exposeur to the Shadow label. However I have heard of this CD, so I bought it. Well first of all it is a very good CD. The quality is very high and the music itself is very very good. It all has a very dark and hard feal to it. Which I really enjoy, this album brings me back to my early days when I was into underground Detroit Techno. I'm not quite sure why but it brings me back to that but it sure as hell does. The album is great for driving around in the evening just as the sun dips below the horizon and the sky is a pale blue with the stars just barely visible. Now thats what Shadow is all about"
1,Don't do it,Cutter didn't work.AC Adapter didn't work.Won't print labels.Return pending.Would never buy one of their products again.
1,"Continually jams, would never buy again","A real pain to use. Fiddly to key information in, tape supply spool jams practically every time. I dread using it."
1,Text fades,"I was happy with this product when I first purchased it but now I want my money back. I used the labels to put my name and contact info on photo equipment (compact flash cards, lenses, cameras) but the text faded making the labels pointless. (And on a few items the labels started coming off) It's probably fine for other uses but the labels don't last on things that are in the elements and being handled on a regular basis. I've used a more expensive labelmaker in the past and haven't had a problem with the labels fading or coming off (and they looked nicer too). This is a classic ""you get what you pay for"" situation."
5,Fabulous Labelmaker!,"The Dymo LetraTag is everything a labelmaker should be. It's easy to use, versatile, and prints labels that are easy to read and stay stuck. Since I got it a few months ago, I've been labeling everything that isn't nailed down. :-) I've used it to make labels for file folders, decorative storage boxes, and shelves.Years ago I had another label maker that was bigger, more complicated, cost more, and created labels that didn't always stay stuck (like that Seinfeld episode). This one is a dream come true by comparison, and I recommend it highly. It can't be beat, especially for the price!"
2,Longgevity,Lasted a couple months and the printing started getting faintand little it faded practically away
3,customer service is lacking,"The first unit I purchased was a complete dud. The unit had problems straight out of the package.Customer service was no better. While they were friendly in their emails, they appeared to be clueless about the product and how to make it workable.Thankfully the store I purchased it from allowed me to trade it for a different unit. I have had no problems with the replacement unit at the time of this writing.If you like to gamble with your money, go ahead and get it. If you don't like dealing with less than satisfactory customer service, look to other brands."
2,Too Many Batteries,"This label maker does what it is intended for (basic labels), however 6 AAA batteries are about 4 too many in my opinion. The keys are in alphabetical order which is also difficult to get used too. Refills are pricey too and are not readily available at office supply stores."
2,Display failed after a year or so for no apparent reason,"Just like a number of others have reported on this site, the display gave out after a year or so of use although the unit was well taken care of. But while it worked, it was a great little unit - very convenient and efficient. I think I got my money's worth and since I still have left-over label tape (the really expensive part of this proposition), I will probably buy another one."
2,Will not buy again,Was happy with product when I first got it. Found that the tape tends to jam which wastes tape. Now the display has become unreadable. Put in fresh batteries but didn't fix problem. I have owned it for a year but it has only printed four rolls of labels in that time.
2,Display problem,"My LetraTag is in like new condition since I used it very infrequently the last 2 or 3 years and I am also very careful with my stuff. Now the display has gone bad. It looks as if there are a lot of segments out --so you cannot tell what letters or numbers you have typed. If it is just a very basic short label you can manage, because it still actually prints correctly, but it's very difficult to use it now that you can't read the LCD anymore. New batteries didn't help. I am sort of ticked off, seeing as how I bought several replacement cartridges too [expensive] and now they will go to waste. I contacted DYMO support via email with no response."
5,Easy to use,"I thought the lack of the querty keyboard would slow me down. It didn't. This is an excellent labeler for only $20. I figured out how to make labels with different fonts, boxes, 2 lines, etc., in about 5 minutes, without reading the manual. The only small wish I might ask for is higher resolution print like the Brother labeler does. My wife uses that one. However, the labels with the split in the backing really makes this labeler superior for me. The Brother doesn't have the split backing and I've spent two or three minutes per label trying to peel the back off the Brother's labels. My son likes Dymo's alligator box outline. I like the BIG fonts option. I'm off to label some stuff that probably doesn't need a label, but I have new toy."
1,not worth the time to read,"If this book takes you a full day to read, then in the same time, an average of 150 Christians will have been killed (somewhere in the world) for their beliefs. Approximately 137,000 babies will have been aborted. You can't tell me that while Christianity is under threat globally, attacking Mormons is the best use of our energy. Even if they don't accept the Nicene creed, they are not the biggest threat. This book's strategy is to straighten deck chairs as the Titanic sinks. Here's a better use of time: how about writing to someone in Congress to stop legislating away our freedom of worship?"
1,"ED DECKER IS A ""NUT"" LIER* LIER* LIER",This person is full of half truths mostly made up stories with NO proof..He should be locked in a padded cell but this would give him more time to write stupid stuff at tax payers expence.
5,An Amazing Expose' on Mormonism,"This is the most amazing book! Mormons are taught to talk a kind of ""God-talk"" to make them appear as though they are Christians. Put that together with the fact that they are often so nice that they are attractive to people. However, their teaching is falsehood and heavily guarded in secrecy, because the truth about the teaching is so shockingly false and, actually, bizarre. Please read this book and share it with others!"
2,"""Kettle: Blacker Than Black!"" written by: A Pot","I read this years ago, having found it on a relative's shelf. Said relative had been seriously burned by her Mormon stepfamily, so that should have been an indicator of bias, but I was young, what did I know?Now that I have critical thinking skills and access to the internet, it comes out that Decker himself is a former Mormon, now evangelical, allegedly having been excommunicated for cheating repeatedly on his wife. To be sure, I know other ex-Mormons with qualms about their upbringing, but none with such a checkered past or with quite so much vehemence against it as Decker, and notably none that have moved onto a higher plane of religious zealotry like he has.So the LDS are weird and definitely have negative elements in the fundamentalist fringe (what faith doesn't?), but here it all just comes off like the same degree of born-again hysteria leveled against Harry Potter. Read if you'd like, but cross-reference."
4,Indeed there are two sides.,"I found this book to be blunt. When I met my wife she was in the LDS Church, and I was not. I was facinated that Mormons actually believed they would be gods. Before ever picking up this book, I could see that the LDS didn't have it all figured out. After reading this book, I realized just how many times the LDS church has indeed had to correct itself. My wife is not longer in the LDS church. We are both born again Christians. This book has been a tremendous blessing to our faith. But this book is hardly what I would give my LDS friends. It is very abraisive, and would need to be read with the understanding that the author is very sure of his beliefs. His presentaion is a little demeaning to someone who is sure of their beliefs in the LDS church. If you are in the LDS church I would urge you to get the facts that are presented in this book."
3,Mr. Decker needs to find a more uplifting hobby,"This book has one purpose and one purpose only. (okay, two. the second is to line the author's pockets) This book is a poorly veiled attempt at trying to destroy a religion that the author, Ed Decker, has become disaffected from. Read between the lines. He inveigles, deceives, and obfuscates whenever it suits his purpose. The issue here isn't whether the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints is true or not, but rather that the authors of the God Makers throw truth out the window whenever it suits their obvious agenda."
3,It's All About the Primary Sources.,It's all about the primary sources. If you want to know the truth about someone or something you go the primary source. In the case of the false prophet Joseph Smith a good place to start would be the original book of Mormon that he wrote. Wilford C. Wood innocently reproduced the 1830 1st edition of the book of Mormon from uncut sheets. It is available from here:Joseph Smith Begins His Work Volume 1It shows that the book in not inspired.
2,This book is Hunt and Decker's autobiography,"As an anti-Mormon tract, The God Makers is about as good as they come. Enough solid LDS doctrine is included to give the text a ring of authenticity, then the authors bend it all out of shape with obscure so-called research points that the reader cannot possibly verify. The result is a mixed-up jumble of truth and error that represents tabloid journalism at best. There are better works on Mormon theology than this for readers conducting serious research.At the end of the day, if a God is an authority on everything and able to touch every person on the planet, Hunt and Decker's work might best be described as an autobiography, especially now it's available across the Web. They certainly know it all . . . and are set up as Gods with the royalties."
1,a good companion to this book,"If you read this book, I highly suggest that you read this companion to it immediately before making any conclusions:Gilbert Scharffs; The Truth About ""The God Makers"" (Publishers Press, Salt Lake City, Utah, 1986)And there is also another book I have seen called ""they that lie in wait to deceive"" but I haven't had the chance to read it yet. Both of these cover the lies included in ""The God Makers."" The book is really amazing at how inaccurate it is. Might be interesting to you, but like I said, read the other side of the story along with it."
1,Weak try,"Decker has made a career of trying to destroy the LDS church, this attitude alone should show that nothing good can come from his pen. In this book he has taken half truths and out right lies and twisted them together into what he calls the ""truth""."
1,Modern hype and innacuracy,"This book is _not_ 80% accurate. The book goes as far to say that in the Washington Temple attic there is a replica of the oval office because Mormons supposedly want to take over the government.There is nothing in this book that is scholarly, and it is filled with sensationalistic claims that are patently false. Most critics of the LDS Church distance themselves from Ed Decker and this book in particular, including career critics Jerald and Sandra Tanner"
2,the god makers,not near what I wanted nothing about the inner workings of the Mormon Church or how they control the state of Utah
1,"I've read the book, and it's a clever deception","Ed Decker's The Godmakers is a sad distortion of a good and positive religion and people. What is so unfortunate is that so many of the lies and misrepresentations in the book had to have been deliberately crafted in full knowledge of the true Mormon doctrine. THIS BOOK WAS CONDEMNED BY THE ANTI-DEFAMATION LEAGUE OF B'NAI BRITH FOR BEING A MISLEADING DISTORTION OF MORMON HISTORY, DOCTRINE, AND BELIEFS. How much stock can you put in a book like that? Ed Decker lies for the Lord. A better book is ""The Truth About The Godmakers"", available at LDS bookstores--it calmly answers each and every charge of Decker, without the sensationalism that his book reeks of. Decker's book reads like the trailer of some bad horror movie from the 50's. Don't be afraid--""the Godmakers"" is just make-believe."
1,"If you're curious about Latter-day Saints, ask one.","Anyone who has questions about ANY church, culture or group of people would be foolish to go to someone outside the church or group for information, particularly to someone who dislikes the people. I would never believe gossip, which is what this book is. It is twisted and wrong. Anyone who desires to know this can earnestly pray about it. We, as humans, have a responsibility to be as intelligent as we can. Stay away from this book, or anything like it."
1,Half truths and misrepresentations,"I've read this book several times with a critical eye. Each time I read it, I find myself regretting the fact I'm being inundated with half truths and misrepresentations about the Mormon Church. I do not recommend this book if you're interested in learning facts. Keep searching."
1,wow!,"I almost couldnt take this book seriously. Almost all the information that he used to back himself up has been outdated for years and has been since proven incorrect. Especially his remarks on the history of south america. He obviously chose to ignore new discoveries so he wouldnt have to face them in his book. I am a member of the LDS church. I am very educated on historical and doctrinal subjects and this has got to be one of the worst anti-mormon books ever written. He is uneducated or just wrong in many cases. And if you do read this book at least read some literature from the other side of spectrum, the LDS literature. I think the best place to get information on a subject is from its source; They are not going to lie about there own doctrine. I have a testimony of the church of jesus christ of latter day saints and i know beyond the shadow of a doubt it is the only true church on the earth and it was set up by jesus christ."
1,Perfect book for the Anti-Mormon,"In a world of suspicion, no medium is safe. It seems that the forum for worldwide dissemination of nonsense known as the Internet to sell Books has provided conspiracy buffs with a chance to spread all of their theories and musings to what could be the largest audience in the world today. Hate and fear have always sold and made big bucks. The same can be said of this book. It reminds me of The Nazi propaganda against the Jews. This book is as useful as reading Klu Klux Klan material on Afro-Americans.However, if you hate Mormons this is the book to buy. Inaccuracies in print seem to give the impressions of being legitimate to the ignorant. Let me say in warning that many other professional Anti-Mormons reject Ed Decker for getting too ridiculous even for them."
1,Worthless,"This book is simply an argument that one religion is better than another.It isn't what I thought it would be, which is a description of Mormonism beliefs, about which I know very little. Instead it is a rant against Mormonism, which may be accurate, but rants aren't really worth much. To argue that one religion has it all right while another has it all wrong is, by default, likely very wrong regardless of the religions involved, and boring as hell.Oh well. Suffice it to say that this book isn't worth reading even the title of."
3,The truth needs to be known.,"I have read this book several times. If you were to read this book along with a bible of your own for reference, he has made some convincing arguments for ""de-christianizing"" the mormon church.If this is a subject that interests you, there are other, more objective books and articles in circulation that convene the same message without the fire and brimstone approach Mr. Decker uses."
3,Not the best for investigating this cult,"This book offers a tabloid view of the Mormon church. A lot of the basics are true, and it's nice for a Mormon to read because they (as I, a formor Mormon was) are really fed a white-washed version of everything pertaining to the LDS church through their church meetings, and church produced literature. Some of this book needs to be taken with a grain of salt... I'm not sure he has used the most reliable sources.However, some of the book is right on target, it exposes a lot of the duplicity in the Mormon church that is kept hidden (and forbidden to examine) from its members."
3,"About 80% accurate, but his bitterness seeps through.","I was a Mormon for 30 years so I feel I know what I'm talking about.Mr Decker's book was well researched and presented, but hetried very hard to place the most bizarre spin on the factsthat he could. Mormonism is strange enough without tryingto add to it!Also, his 'I'm more righteous than you' attitude tendsto distract from the message.Clint Lauricella"
1,Interesting research methods . . .,". . . what I call the reverse scientific method. The author draws his conclusions first and then selects ""facts"" to support them, sometimes actual facts, sometimes twisted or warped facts.Any facts which do not support the authors conclusions are simply ignored. Happy I borrowed a copy rather than bought it. One star is too many.I've had doubts about Mormon teachings, but if this is the alternative, maybe Mormonism has something to it after all . . ."
1,Brutally dishonest,"I'm a former Mormon who still loves to read about the church. Do you want to read serious informant on the church? Try anything by Signature Books, a publishing company that features real scholars. This book is a joke, the ""sources"" are misleading (one source literally says 'Mary, from Utah.'"") D. Michael Quinn, a former church member who is a historian and considered one of the most trustworthy voices within the LDS revisionist history, took the time to warn about this joke of a book. If you're into sophisms and misleading arguments, then by all means, this is for you. Finally, so many revisionist books came about by honest church members who became disenchanted when they learned the real history of the church and wanted to share their discoveries. Decker, on the other hand, seems like an angry pre-teen settling a score."
1,Hoax!!,"This piece of litereature, well written as it is, is slanderous and degrading to the Mormon Church. This book is false and can not be substantiated by church doctrine. The ideas are twisted and taken so far out of context that if the same method was used on the bible, any other book of scripture, or religion, all religions would be seen as false. Wake up and open your eyes America. The Mormon Church won't fleece you nearly as much as the God makers will. Ed Decker is a mastermind who is guilty of what he professes the Mormons are doing. It is somewhat simple and easy to understand."
1,Satanic Work At its Best,This book is a tribute to the satanic work that the devil puts out to draw people unto him and his darkness. Why would anyone spend their own time trying to rip down a church that was based on Gods true church established by Jesus Christ. That itself is satanic and evil. This church teaches love and goodwill to all men. This Church teaches how to draw near unto Jesus and The LDS church IS the ONLY true church.
1,1 star is still too much for this book,"If you are going to read a book on Buddism written by a Muslim, are you going to believe that it is going to be a 100% accurate and non-biased? Come on, it's not like we are talking about PC vs Mac here. I would only recommand this book to those who wants to actually see how bias it can get in the world of religion."
1,Sensationalism,"Everyone knows that sensationalism sells. If you are looking for a sensationalistic interpretation of Mormon beliefs this book is for you. If you are looking for a more factual historical or theological interpretation of the LDS Church, there are a lot better books out there. Why not give reading the Book of Mormon a try. Along with the Bible, this is the book the LDS Church is based on. It will help you understand LDS member's faith and mindset."
5,The God Makers,"This book was a real eye opener, I never pulled together all of the deceit in the Mormon church until I read The God Makers. It mad me much more aware of what the Mormon church teaches. Good book."
2,Probably not worth your money (in a former Mormon's view),"The reviews of this book pretty much sum up the problem with any anti-Mo book: books like Godmakers typically inspire either immediate, vituperative testimonies of ""the church"", or alternatively inspire empty characterization as educational and insightful without citing WHAT exactly is educational or insightful about the work.The truth is, you won't learn much from this book that you can't get from a better source. Godmakers tends to downplay the varying levels of Mormon-ness Mormons experience outside Utah, and it emphasizes practicalities and the human failures of church leaders while belittling the faith-based element typical of any organized religion.As a former Mormon myself, I opened this book with great interest. I put it down half read and have not opened it in months. While I am normally a fan of honest intellectual inquiry into what this church believes, I respectfully suggest looking elsewhere for viewpoints on the LDS faith."
5,A Must See For Christians,"This book is a must for all Christians who want to know the double meaning of the Mormon's talk of Jesus, God, salvation, or any other Biblical words. They are deceiving when telling others about their church."
1,Most falsely sickening book,"Mr. Decker is a sick man. Another slime ball out to pick on a group of people whom he thinks he knows a lot about. A greedy man out to make a mint . A repulsive man who thinks he did his homework; well, he did-completely off the top of his head. I would not give him the time of day."
1,Another book about heathens by heathens,"I was interested in this book until I read everybody's opionion on in. I grew up and live in Salt Lake City, the only thing more annoying than Mormons on a soapbox are other so-called christian groups on other soapbox's denouncing Mormons with verse. How can you locically argue something that isn't logical to begin with. Look at the holes in your own religion before you look at the holes in everyone elses. Shooting down one persons faith to build up your own is wrong. If christian groups are going to pick apart the Book of Mormon for contradictions to the Bible, then they need to pick apart the Bible for it's contradictions to reality. The Bible was written under complete revisionist history and is one of the most re-edited books that has ever existed. Most of it is based on reconstituted mythology from pre-christian cultures. This argument is a diatribe for a confederacy of dunces."
1,are you kidding??,"This book i dont think contains a single ""fact"" about mormonism, it is full of lies, half truths, and deciet. I can see how those who dont know much about mormonism can actually believe this, and then they declare it FACT!!! but honestly it is not the truth!!! The National Conference of Christians and Jews did a study of the film, compared it to what Latter-Day Saints actually believe, and came to this conclusion:""The Film (the god makers nor the book)does not in our opinion fairly portray the Mormon church, Mormon history, or Mormon belief. It makes extensive use of half-truth, faulty generalizaton, erroneous interpretations, and sensationalism. It is not reflective of the genuine spirit of the Mormon Faith""-NCCJ Programs in Pluralism March-April, 1984 Number 2 page 3.If you want to know what mormons actually believe, its simple ask a mormon, if you dont know one, visit www.LDS.org, or www.mormon.org!!!!"
2,Full of half truths and mis-statements,"After reading this book, it forced me to do some of my own research. I found that the author(s) used outdated material and in some cases used out and out untruthful material in their research. I thank the author(s) though, because I now have a better understanding of the ""Mormon"" church, not because of their efforts in discrediting the organization, but inspite of them. This book is fairly well written and quite humorous, but should not be taken literally."
4,Eye Opener to a Cult,"Growing up on the outside edges of this society, made one curious. Knew enough to stay out of the way. Seemed to be more prevalent in the 60's or openly against the outsiders. The book answered a lot of questions. Also the back up movie with clarification from a friend who is part of the LDS hierachy, explaining that this is true information. Worthwhile reading."
1,The TANNERS were offended by this stuff,The Tanners who run light house ministry (an anti-Mormon cult) were quite offended by this book. That should tell you about the credibilty of this book. It is not like anti-Mormons to fight amongst themselves.
2,The Truth About The God Makers,"I found this book severely inaccurate, very negative and destroying. It fosters hate and animosity.I also read a book called (The TRUTH About ""The God Makers"") by Gilbert W. Scharffs. It is a response to the inaccurate portrayal of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.If you honestly want the truth read Gilbert Scharffs book The TRUTH about ""The God Makers""."
1,THANKS MR DECKER !!!!!!,AFTER READING YOUR BOOK MY FAMILY AND I JOINED THE ONLY TRUE CHURCH ON THE EARTH.THANKS AGAINTHE MORMON CHURCHES NEWEST MEMBER
1,Decker distorts the truth!,"Anyone who has read one of Ed Deckers book knows that he has one purpose in mind, which is to destroy those things that confuse him. In his commentary on freemasonry he claims to understand their secret order but doesn't even come close. Christians should not resort to such mudslinging ideologies. Christ taught that we must love our neightbors and our enemies. Anyone who is a true Christian will abhor this book!"
3,true + false = FALSE!,"This book has mixed truth with error. I don't know why people spend their time trying to destroy the LDS church instead of trying to do good for others. I guess it pays well. I wonder if the author has used the proceeds from the sale of this book for some Christian purpose other than his own. Hope he will. I'd like to purchase the book, ""the truth about the godmakers"", please help. I'm a non-mormon but have associated with the lds people for quite some time. For a church portrayed so evil in this book by Decker, it seems that it is the other way around."
2,more poor quality movies,"Why the manufacturers don`t put more effort into recording old movies is a shame. These have very poor picture quality. They use the excuse of age as a disclaimer but a major studio will release the same film with excellent picture quality. ""Whistle Stop"" is a prime example. In the age of high definition why can`t they do a better job? Picture quality can differ from label to label. Sometimes I have to purchase three copies of the same movie to find one with a decent picture. Of course they are budget, but wouldn`t it be just as easy and cost effective to do it right the first time?"
3,"$ 0.31 per page: expensive , but interesting","1. 75 pages2. $22.503. 8 case studies: charter schools in AZ, Wash.DC, MN, GA, CA, MA, FL, and TX4. Interesting reading for about 1.5 hours5. I wish there was more to chew on here..."
5,The Bomb,Sandy is a good friend of mine and I think that this book will go far! Look out for this book on Oprah's book of the month club coming real soon![...]
2,Dull and rigid,"After watching this set of dvds, I can only say that I'm bored by most of it. The staging and direction is often dull and the acting is mostly rigid. The singing is mediocre, and Hildegard Behrens well past her prime. The saving grace is the excellent performance of the Met orchestra under Levine. But the odds still win the day at the end."
2,A production that fails to inspire,"I bought this DVD production a few weeks ago and have watched it a few times already. However, I have to say that I'm quite disappointed by it, for the production simply fails to inspire. I enjoy traditional stagings of opera, but the singers here are not well-directed at all. Given that some of the singers aren't very good actors, the result is dramatically very pale indeed.As far as the singing is concerned, not all the singers are up to their task. Some are evidently over-parted while others are already past their prime. The conducting of Levine also leaves much to be desired as there is insufficient foward drive in his musical making. The Met's orchestra performs well."
2,A let-down,"I have to say I'm rather disappointed by this production. Maybe it works well in the theatre (I didn't see it at the Metropolitan). However, it doesn't work too well on video. Both the production and stage direction are stodgey and the acting is of the elementary kind. I don't think the singing is too inspiring. Maybe Wagner isn't that suitable for me, but this production definitely fails to arouse my interest in Wagner's music and drama. It doesn't work for me."
1,A downright disappointment,"This set of Ring cycle dvd is a downright disappointment. Although the Met orchestra performs well enough, Levine's interpretation is stodgy and uninspiring. Unfortunately, the singing is worse, the chief offender being Hildegard Behrens worn Brunnhilde - she shouldn't have taken the role in the first place. Most of the other singers are either below their best, past their prime, or totally miscast. I won't recommend this to anyone."
5,Excellent performance,"These DVDs are outstanding! High quality video and sound. Nothing to complain about them! Althoug I must recognize that the DVDs recorded at the Bayreuth Festival are better, we certainly cannot demerit this version of the Ring. They are also wonderful! Siegfried Jerusalem, Jessye Norman and Hildegard Behrens are simply marvelous!"
5,Review,I watched Wagner's opera Der Ring des Nibelungen twenty years ago when it was first televised by the Metropolitan Opera and was enthralled by the production. I was equally excited by the fact that it was still available as a DVD. This DVD package met all my expectation in quality of product and the quick service in getting it to my home was equally appreciated. Thanks so very much!
5,Magnificent,"It's hard to believe most of the reviews on this website. Levine's 1990 Ring is the most magnificent thing I've ever seen done on the stage, and the film is nearly flawless. This production converted me to Wagner. In a word, it is magnificent."
2,Rather liveless and indifferently performed,"I am one of those conservative opera-goers that enjoy operas being produced in 'traditional stagings'. So this production should have appealed to me.Unfortunately, I'm rather disappointed by what I see, as the performance is quite lifeless. I suppose the stage director is to blame, for he has failed to ignite much fire and passion on the stage despite all those high drama inherent to the work.This is not helped by the indifferent acting and singing of the cast. I admire the Met's orchestra, though, who is captured here on top form. Yet, Levine's ponderous musical direction is not at all to my taste.I can therefore only give this set a qualified welcome."
2,Not entirely satisfactory production,"Having viewed the entire DVD several times, I can say that I'm not that satisfied with what I see and hear.It's great to have a production with traditional sets, in particular as we're often nowadays treated to so many stupid productions with all those irrelevant ""up-dates"". Unfortunately, the stage direction here is insufficiently lively and often unimaginative, thus making several of the scenes fall flat.On the musical side, there are a number of flaws in the casting with several singers either past their prime or are physically unconvincing in their roles. The orchestra of the Met does a great job, but the effort is marred by Levine's rather stodgy conducting.I think it is still worthy to get this DVD recording. Yet, all those reservations cannot be overlooked."
2,An earth-boung production,"It seems that the views as regards this production have been rather polorised. Well, instead of analysing the merits and faults of this production, which other reviewers can evidently do better than I can, I would only say that I'm rather bored when watching this monumental cycle on DVD. The point is that there're very few places in this production where the drama or the music really lifts off. For most of the time, the production remains resolutely earth-bound. The singing and acting are mostly mediocre, and the camera work is quite unimaginative. In fact, I enjoy listening to the Ring cycle on audio CD more than when watching this DVD set. Others may of course have a different view. But for me, I'm more than a little disappointed by what I see and hear."
5,Watch this one first...,"I saw this production in person, and it was a wonderful experience. If you aren't familiar with Wagner's Ring cycle, or you know the music but haven't seen it, this box set is definintely your best bet. It doesn't have any political or artistic agenda - it mostly follows what was called for originally. My impression in the audience was that this is what it would have looked like if you saw Nordic mythology taking place. And Nordic mythology is the ostensible topic of these operas, you can decide for yourself whether you're interested in possible subtexts. None of this is to say that this production doesn't have depth or subtlety, or that it's ""stodgy."" Staging the Ring is a big undertaking, and this was a fantastic realization of that endeavor, with great attention to detail. It's visually very pleasing - and the Ring was meant to be seen as well as heard. Whether or not it's the exact cast that everyone would want, all the performers in this production were world-class."
2,"Get the Rheingold, avoid the others","I would suggest any one who wishes to invest in this cycle to buy the Rheingold DVD and sample the other operas before making a decision for I found the performances of the other 3 operas in the cycle to be far from idea.Levine's often slow tempo creates quite a lot of problems for the singers. He is at his best in Rheingold but his conducting becomes more and more drawn out in the subsequent operas. As seen on DVD, Norman isn't a convincing Sieglinde and Lakes's Siegmund disappoints. The Gunther and Gutrune are also not well casted, as is the Alberich. Ludwig, late in her career at the time of this production, disappoints as Fricka. Behrens is simply over-parted as Brunnhilde. Morris is an adequate Wotan and Jerusalem a pleasing Siegfried.The production is good but ordinarily directed. The final crumbling of Valhalla is disappointingly done. The videography, however, is good."
2,Getting gradually worse as the cycle progresses,"I'm afraid this production doesn't making very enjoyable viewing/listening as the performances get gradually worse as the cycle progresses.Rheingold proves to be a promising start, but the tension begins to sag a bit in Walkure. A big decline in performance standards greets the viewer/listener in Siegfried whereas Gotterdammerung provides an anti-climatic end through some lifeless tempos and inadequate singing.I'm OK with the staging but it isn't much help to the performance as a whole. I've no regret buying the set, but I'm indeed quite disappointed by the performances."
2,Plodding performance,"The production of this Ring cycle is OK for me. It's not very interesting, but it's also true to the spirit of Wagner's work.I'm however disappointed by the performance. I know that there're different views as regards James Levine conducting and I belong to the group who found him disappointing. The speed that he adopts is far too slow and lifeless, which renders the performance a plodding one. The singers are not that outstanding with a few who're below their best, including some in the major roles.I don't think this is a very inspiring and invigorating performance."
2,Disappointed by the production,"I managed to sit through the entire cycle over Christmas. I'm afraid I don't have many positive words to say. I'm not familiar with Wagner's operas and I thought that a production from one of the greatest opera houses of the world might serve as a good introduction. I'm disappointed by what I saw as I found the production to be mostly very boring. Not that it doesn't have any impressive moments. It most certainly has. However, it is not dramatically engaging enough, just like a costume drama which fails to take flight dramatically. The singing is generally OK but the singers don't act that well (fault of the director?). As can be read from the other reviews, I'm sure that some other people can better appreciate this production. Yet, I have to say that I'm not at all impressed by what I see."
2,Unhappy with Levine's conducting,"In my view, that chief drawback of this dvd release lies in the lethargic conducting of Levine. There should be no doubt that the orchestra of the Met gives us playing of enviable standard here. Unfortunately, the music just drags on under the baton of Levine, who often fails to piece the many transitional passages together in a coherent and dramatic manner. His slow tempo also causes much straining on the part of the singers, and in particular Frau Behrens, whose slender and patchy voice cannot adequately cope with Brunnhilde's music. The other cast members are often little more than adequate. Surely not a great performance, which, as I've said, is unhelped by Levine's interpretation. Quite disappointing."
3,"The old-fashioned way, by Otto Schenk","An earlier reviewer said that since Wagner was a great writer and essayist he had no need to infuse his operas with political meaning. I'd rather ask how such a deeply political person as Wagner certainly was could possibly NOT try to get his message across through his art.Be that as it may, this production doesn't care about politics one bit. It's old-fashioned in more than one sense of the word, and in fact may just be the single greatest anachronism early 21st-century theatre has to offer. (It's still playing at the Met.) ""Liking"" it or not, therefore, has nothing to do with taste and all to do with the fundamental opinion each of us has of what theatre is all about.So, given the fact most of the reviewers here seem to believe opera should be a museum of the past, what really astonishes me is that not one of them even mentions the director's name. It's not James Levine (who does an astonishing job of conducting the score.) It's Otto Schenk."
2,Spoilt by inadequate casting,"The chief glory of this Ring, in my view, is the performance of the orchestra of the Met. However, Levine's conducting is at times lethargic.The cast is wildly uneven. The major blot on the set is Hildegard Behrens's unstable and weak Brunnhilde. Some of the cast members are also past their prime. The acting is unremarkable and the production, though loyal to most of Wagner's original instructions, is uninteresting."
5,Another Rave for Renees Garden,"As usual, Renees Garden seeds do not dissapoint! All of my seeds have come up very nicely. My largest plants is about 12 inches high now. I'm looking forward to the harvest. The seeds germinated before my other tomato seeds did, by at least 3 days. Extremely happy, and will by them again next year."
4,Ghost Beach Is The Best Book You'll Ever Read,Ghost Beach is such an exellent book. When I read the back of the book I was thrilled! Read to see what happens in this story. This is about two children that go to their grandparent's house. They meet three kids while they go in a cave. The kids tell them stories about a ghost that lives in the cave. One night the kids go to the beach. They meet the kids again. The kids ask them if they would help them trap the ghost. They say yes. The rest you should find out by yourself.R.L. Stine wrote this book to teach us to listen to our parents or someone who takes care of you. You should tell your friends to be truthful with each other.I loved this book so much I couldn't put it down.It wouldn't leave my hands.This is the third best book I have ever read!
1,One way to dave $$..don't buy this book!,"This book is filled with ridiculous ideas. For example, a suggested way to save money on a wedding gown is to buy it at a garage sale? Or instead of buying new white shoes, just wear an old pair..but remember to clean them up! Or..if you do not want to spend money on a florist, just grow your own flowers, and create your own bouquets. I was looking for some realistic answers...and there are a few in this book, but overall, I think it was a definite waste of my money."
3,OUTDATED BOOK MAY SAY YOU A FEW BUCKS...,"The big question: is this book good enough to save you the 12 dollars you spent on it? My big complaint is this book needs to be updated. I found a great list of outlit stores, only problem the phone numbers provided were so old, many numbers had been disconnected."
4,Great Find!,"This book provided a lot of insight into ways to save money. Some of them were repetitive, but still were helpful. I definitely recommend reading this BEFORE you start planning your wedding."
5,Full Of Wonderful Cost Cutting Ideas.....,"As a bride2be I am very glad books like this exsist, because like many of you my soon to be groom and I dont have a large budget to throw this wonderful fantastic never to be forgotten wedding and reception, were both two hard working people with bills to pay. We want a wonderful wedding but within cost reason no sense in going overboard, were practical the $$ could be used best elsewhere, yet it is ""my"" day and I want it to be special, I want to be the princess I've always dreamed of being, and thanks to budget minded books like this one I can have my cake and eat it too with a lil $$ to spare.....!"
4,Kudos to 1001 Ways to Save Money....,"By far, this was the most thorough and practical book I read on the subject. A must-see for any Bride truly interested in avoiding debt!"
1,Dah!,"This book was not helpful. It gave you ideas on how to save that were common sense. For example, cut down the guest list. Dah!!! That is obvious, the less people the less expensive."
2,Not as good as I had hoped,"I purchased this book to help me plan my wedding. It was the first book I read on the subject, so I was really wanting something a bit more in depth. This book simply lists simple ideas that could easily be found in other books. I would recommend ""Bridal Bargains"" instead because the book is far more informative and gives you useful ideas and budgeting help."
2,Common Sense,"The advice in this book is basically all common sense. The author constantly tells you to use friends and family who happen to be singers, florists, charterers, artists, etc. If you really feel like you need this book, check the library and save the $15....that's what the book is all about, right, saving money? Oh yeah, the author didn't mention that one."
3,1001 Ways to save & still have a dazzling wedding,This book was OK - the information provided was not any different from advice provided in magazines and on websites.
2,not very useful,"Did not find the book very useful. Most of the ideas were common sense. For example, ""look for clearances or sales when buying your rings"" or ""use your friends employee discount when buying your dress"". There was some good info regarding webistes."
4,Helpful,"This book has some creative ideas on how to save money and is worth looking at if you have a wedding coming up. I read it before my wedding, and I don't know that it saved me A LOT of money, but it did help me think of some creative personalized things to do."
3,metamorphosis alpha,"I feel that if you like the old metamorphosis alpha, then the info here you will like as well. This version really does capture the flavor of the original and is very well illustrated. I would have rated higher if another rules set was used beside the amazing engine but hey as gm's we can always adjust the info to our pet rules system. bottom line:""Get it if you can, I did and don't regret it.""hope this helps.thank you for your time."
4,Almost the Best,"I thought this was an excellent example of Dino's work, except for the version of You're Nobody Till Somebody Loves You. Its not nearly as good as the one on the other CD's."
4,Smooth as silk,"I grew up listening to Dean, Tony, Perry, and of course, Frank. Dean always had a special place in our family's heart, and this collection is a perfect reminder of how polished and lush Dean Martin's voice was. The recording is fun and nostalgic, and I am thrilled to have all my favorite Dean Martin songs on one excellent CD. I recommend it to Baby Boomers everywhere."
5,Great Sounding CD,"I was reluctant to get this cd because I already owned Dean Martin's 10 Best Greatest Hits Collection. Boy, was I glad to get it anyway because of the sound quality. This collection has obviously been remastered. The sound of this cd is great. The music on this cd are so relaxing. It just creates a feeling of the good old days. I can't say much because others have already pointed out all the good things about it."
3,Poor Sound Quality,"I am very disappointed in the sound quality. The content is good however, so if you can accept an, in my opinion, subpar listening experience it could be recommended. The sound seems somewhat muffled and distant, not crisp and clear. Adjusting the equalizer and sound fields and turning up the volume help."
2,The only Dino you'll ever need ...,"... and thank the good lord for that, because a little of this pap goes a lonnnnng way.I am always amazed when people talk about the 1950s being innocent times, or the 1960s, or the 1940s. Innocent? Maybe we should instead say naive. Because only the 50s and 60s would buy into Dino's ""drunk 'n' fun"" act.With a contemporary ear, one can hear Dino's ""I don't give a damn,"" his ""screw the fans,"" his ""I just don't care."" We can hear all that now, and it is 100% sickening."
2,When I hear this music ...,"... I want to hand Dino a glass of Shut-Up Juice.Dean Martin was, without doubt, the greatest drinker and womanizer of the 20th century. But as a singer, which was his original career before taking up booze full-time, he communicates so little honesty that one just ends up feeling dirty and used... in a bad way, I mean."
2,King of Cool? More like King of Cornpone!,"I have tried hard to like these songs, but they are relentlessly corny and Dean basically just phones in the vocals. Sinatra wouldn't be caught dead singing this collection of tinny tunes."
1,Pop quiz,"Have you:1. Seen a cello before?2. Seen someone else play the cello?If you answered ""yes"" to both of these, your knowledge of the cello is already too advanced to gain anything from this DVD. There is almost nothing of substance in this ""lesson"", and the tiny amount of actual information present is repeated endlessly over a period of thirty minutes. I'm not sure if she (Or he? I'm actually a little confused about that) is used to teaching very small children or the mentally handicapped, but for any person of even moderate intelligence this lesson moves at a maddeningly slow pace."
1,Not worth the time,"The Patriots Club is so far removed from reality that I could not force myself through the last 80 or so pages to finish it.The book is rife with mistakes, misconceptions, and just some plain ugly lies. Alexander Hamilton supposedly hated the 22nd Amendment even though that Presidential term limits didn't come about until 150 years after his death. Oops. Does anyone really believe a lowly Lt. Colonel can make the arbitrary decision to buy an unvetted weapon for the entire USMC? The utter incompetence of some of the police work the author writes about in this book makes Barney Fife look like a professional investigator in comparison. There's so much more, but it's making my head hurt thinking about it.Maybe some Hollywood producers could believe some of the far-fetched dreck in this book, but you shouldn't. Reich either spent zero time researching or expects everyone to be as ignorant as the ideas and notions he put in this book."
3,A good diversion.,"I found this book enjoyable. The story was plotted and executed well. The main character was able to do a lot of implausible things like escape from professional soldiers, avoid gunshots and things like that, but that is the norm for a lot of these types of novels. There were a couple of characters that could have been developed further and interacted more, Guilfoyle and Franciscus, which would have made it more interesting. I guess the author's point was to make a statement that the industrial-military complex controls the world."
2,Disappointing and Derivative,"Having read and thoroughly enjoyed Christopher Reich's first four books, I waited for ""The Patriots Club"" with eager anticipation. I was disappointed to say the least. The story seemed derivative; elements of it could have almost been lifted from the film ""Enemy of the State"" and alterned only slightly. And did anybody bother to edit or proofread the text? Throughout the book, the Washington, D.C., suburb of McLean, Virginia is spelled ""McClean"". I know, I know, this is a nit: but to me (who grew up in the D.C. area) it also shows either a lack of attention to details, or a lack of caring. Reich is capable of much better."
3,Not up to Reich's prior standards at all,"Reich's prior books I'd read benefited from straightforward and credible plots. This book has a plot that's way more convoluted and roundabout -- and more unlikely. I'm giving it 3 stars only because he's a good writer and because - as in all his books - the financial/banking details are fascinating and probably accurate. That his unarmed hero could keep getting away from these ""all-knowing"" and ""all-powerful"" forces strains credulity!Think carefully about whether you want to spend 2 long evenings reading 540 pages that should have been more like 350."
4,First-rate novel,"Reich has written another intriguing thriller. This intricately plotted novel revolves around a conspiracy at the highest levels of government and Washington society, a Patiot Club that dates back to the earliest days of the American republic. Thomas Bolden becomes enmeshed in a series of events that put him on the run from unknown forces who seek to murder him. The novel suffers somewhat from too many twists and turns and an ending that seems contrived to make everything fit together. Despite this it's one of the best novels I've read recently."
3,the patriots club,i found the book to be very entertaining and the overall plot and subject matter to be plausible and interesting.the superman-like prowess of the hero was very far fetched
2,Put on your tinfoil hat and take some aspirin,"I used to be a Reich fan before I read this book.It's a page-turner, alright: you keep reading hoping it will get better and stop being irritating.If you like ""3 Days of the Condor""-type insider conspiracies and think there's a secret cabal like the Bilderberger committee plotting to take over this country and/or plan on voting for Hillary for President, this book is for you.(It features a ""Senator"" woman becoming President who ""likes to wear black pantsuits."")The plot is so contrived, it's pathetic.I can hardly believe this is the same author that wrote Israeli espionage tales that I thought were interesting."
2,Preposterous Plot,"I love good conspiracy books. I like a believable super hero. The plot of this novel is absurd. The hero, Thomas Bolden, was abandoned at age 6 by his mother. She was an extreme left wing radical who had been pursued by police for participating in a bombing. Bolden grew up in foster homes and after a tough childhood worked his way up enjoying a successful Wall Street career. He is also just about Mr. Perfect. All of a sudden he is targeted by a high powered right wing group called The Patriots Club. The Club has existed and evolved since the days of George Washington. According to the author this club, which has included all Presidents,has secretly and behind the scenes determined U.S. policy since the country's inception. A master computer selects Bolden as a threat and and a bizarre kidnapping of him and his girlfriend ensues. Bolden takes on everything and everyone in his path and ultimately saves the Republic from The Evil. It was tough to get thru all this nonsense."
3,Not Reich's Best!,"The hero of this story,Thomas Bolden, grew up on the streest of Chicago.He has managed to overcome his rough beginnings andbecome a sucess story at a Wall Street firm.He has carved out a good life with the woman that he loves.After winning a prestigous award at an elaborate dinner Bolden's and his girlfriend are assaulted and he is kidnapped.A shadowy organization frames him for crimes that he didn't commit.His face is everywhere on the news.Bolden is forced to revert to his street skills that he learned as a young hoodlum on the streets of Chicago.As Bolden manages to survive one incident after the other he makes another discovery.He discovers a conspiracy about the founding fathers and their families.he also discovers a conspiracy about corporate America.All of this leads to a deadly plan.It will keep you guessing."
4,Conspiring minds want to know,"Just because you are paranoid, doesn't mean someone is not out to get you.In this book a young investment banker confronts a deep and dark conspiracy, a black hand that successfully influenced events throughout American history, a self-perpetuating cabal who membership included the President of the United States. Thomas Bolden stumbles into the workings of the club in what may be the final days of the club or the republic. Bolden proves resourceful and he is aided by mysterious but determined allies. Time is of the essence as the club plots the assassination of the new President of the United States.This book is eerily reminiscent of The Firm, but without the black humor of the control of a law firm being in the hands of the Mafia. If you believe there are no coincidences you will love this book. If you think that conspiracy theorists ought to be in the loony bin, you will still enjoy it."
2,"Stick with ""Rules Of"" series","I have read both of Reich's excellent ""Rules Of"" books and, having enjoyed both immensely, I decided to give one of his earlier efforts a try. But this one is a massive let down, and I really struggled to finish it. With a plot that is way too cliched to be in the least part believable, far too many characters (none of who I could find any empathy for), and so many different scenes and locations that it's easy to forget where you are, what's going on and why, it's not worth the effort. Don't bother."
2,Below Average Predictable Characters and Very Unlikely Plot,"I bought this book as a last minute effort to quickly read something from an author I don't know as I left for a trip on an airplane.My overall thought was that this novel had promise, but the story was way too over the top. The hero is brought into the mess for an outlandish reason, and escapes situations in unbelievable ways. There are too many different conspiracies"" that are all tied in together too neatly. The ""twist"" at the end was almost laughable. In fact, I found myself thinking, ""you're kidding me, right?"" I realize this is a work of fiction, but in the end the storyline should be somewhat believable. This one wasn't even close.I have read other comments about this author that indicate his other novels are better. Sorry, but after spending too much time reading this one, I'm not willing to take the chance on any others. I'll stick to known commodities."
1,Louis Armstrong:Good evenin everyone,"Up until now , the item has not arrived. So I must await its arrival with bated breath ,It is the 10th December and as it is still not in my mailbox , I must sadly say , your service is BAD,BAD,BAD. It is the last time that I will use this customer,and will not hesitate to give negative opinions when asked. , Christopher Charles Mitchell"
3,Just okay.,"I got this DVD based on the extensive song listing. There were some songs played in a professional environment, but many we in a very casual setting and not done like the professional he was. They were at an informal rehersal. I'm quite disappointed in the manner he performed some of my favorites. Additionally, most songs were not played in their entirety. I wish they would simply put together a DVD of Louis singing all the favorites in a fine show business presentation!"
1,pretentious,"Here we go again...Guillou trying to convince his readers, through this wannabe James Bond, that all men, even remotely related to public positions, be they prime ministers, presidents or governmental snow-shufflers, have direct links to the KGB, GRU, Mossad...heck, throw'em all in! Unless you used to belong to a strain of your local communist-party, watch out! Hamilton, the snob, the duke, the wine connoisseur is out to get you! Even X-file-lovers would have a hard time buying this!!!"
5,Guillou is a master of international intrigue and suspense.,"Enemy's Enemy is one of Guillous finest in the 10 book ""Coq Rouge"" series, chronicling the career of Naval Commander Carl Gustaf Gilbert Hamilton, Sweden's reluctant James Bond. The leading Scandinavian master of intrigue and suspense has created a character in the psychological mold of le Carre and with the flare of Flemming. Hamilton is a Swedish noble, recruited by the Swedish navy and trained by the CIA and Navy Seals, to become Sweden's one-man secret army. His mission: hunt down and liquidate a defected Swedish spy in Moscow, to avoid a destructive international secret service war. However, the very men who recruited him are painfully unaware of the extent his of capabilities, and embarrassingly unprepared for the consequences... A beautifully composed and thought provoking novel in a series and by an author unfortunately largely unknown outside of Scandinavia."
4,Get your hands on every book in this serie!,"Jan Guilou is without doubt the best scandinavian spy-novellist. I've read three books in this serie and trying hard to get the last seven (I don't know how many are translated into english). But the books in general give you a great picture of the sitiation in which the spyagencies are at that time. So great exciting mixed with the true ""spy-history"". I've read this book (500+ pages) in 2-3 days. To be honest, this is least exellent book of whose three books I've read, so it's only third best I've read..."
5,"Hey There, It's Yogi Bear!","I can't believe it took so long for an all-time favorite animated treat to come to DVD. They sure don't make'em like this anymore. By the way, David Gates [later of Bread] wrote the catchy theme song. Also, sure wish James Darren's wonderful tune ""Ven-e, Ven-o, Ven-a"" would show up on CD. This beautiful recording is featured in the movie and, as Yogi might say...it's not easy to sound like James Darren! Enjoy!!"
5,Yogi Bear,"This is the first full length yogi bear movie ever made and it was awesome. Yogi, Boo Boo and cindy are fun loving charcters that the whole famliy will love. This movie is great for kids and adults alike. If you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do. Hats Off To Hanna Barbera"
5,"Yogi Bear video, Better Than the Aaaaverage Video!","This is one of the good old movies that is worth every penny of it's purchase. Yogi Bear, in all his glory, is in search of his lost love, Cindy. Cindy got herself purposely shipped off to the zoo because she thought Yogi had been sent there. Come to find out, Yogi, who was supposed to be shipped off to the zoo by the Ranger, instead, tricked another bear into taking his place. And so off we go, on a musical wonderland movie of some of the greatest songs I've ever heard in any musical, while hoping with all our hearts that Yogi will find his Cindy-bear soon. Five stars in my book for any age group. Buy it, you'll love it!"
3,"Received on time, but ...","The Yogi Bear DVD arrived on time, but the disk was heavily scratched. Fortunately for the seller and myself, it still remarkably worked."
4,"Second Edition, Yr 2000 Of The ""Hottest Collectibles"" Guide","This 496 page guide to the hottest current collectibles contains more than 1,300 black and white large, sharp photos and covers more than 10,000 items in 95 categories with current values !!

4,A part of musical history.,"Always liked Jansch..a superb guitarist. Angie is one of the classic guitar tracks, and he is a key part of British folk history."
4,Great listen,"This album is really great to have. It has a lot of good songs with haunting guitar work. It was what I discovered Jansch with, and thats enough to keep it in my collection for life.Throughout his career he touched many amazing places, with many different albums. To me, this albums seems like the small, but modest and entertaining start for Jansch before he really perfected his craft.Either way, it's a great buy, but don't think that this is all there is to Jansch ;) that is a very large and deep pond."
1,I got 1/2 a goblet.,I received the stem only. Never got the top part sent to me. Useless. Would have matched my shot glasses nicely.
1,Received Defective Goblet,I only received the stem/base part. I don't know if they sent me a broken one or if this comes apart. Returned.
4,great for home use,"Very simple labels, good for my home personal kitchen use. Lots of label varieties to order, lots of fonts and options at a great price"
1,Labels Don't Stick-Waste of Good Money,The LetraTag machine is fine however the labels don't stick AT ALL. Don't waste your money on this one. I will NEVER buy from this company again.
5,A GOOD GENERAL PURPOSE LABELER.,"This was purchased to replace a 10 year old Dymo that had lost it's display, but was still printing OK. There was no way of knowing if what I was going to print was correct, so I purchased this very affordable replacement. The old one worked fine for the time I had it and this one is identical. It is versatile enough for most general around the house label making and I don't hesitate to recommend it.R.E.W."
2,Please IMPROVE THE TAPE!!!!!!!! Mothers please read!!!,"This is an inexpensive, adequate label maker. However, if you're the mother of children in daycare and you have to label bottles, or anything that gets washed, forget it!!! The tape disintegrates in the dishwasher, and I have a steam sterlizer, and any plastic tape I use turns dark brown in the sterlizer.I also wish I could make the letters more narrow, they're really thick, and it takes up too much room when labeling narrow items. Also the tape does not bend that easily, so if you're putting it on a surface across hard edges, it will not stick (plastic tape)."
3,What I Like About The Dymo Electronic LabelMaker,"I Usually Label My Compact Discs And The Bookcovers By Using The Computer. I Type The Text On The Microsoft Word Program. Then I Press Ctrl+P And Then I Press Enter On My Keyboard To Print It. Then I Cut Around The Text And Put It In The Xyron 150 Sticker Maker, And I Can Stick It Anywhere. I Like To Make Labels By Using The Computer. Because I Can Label Things In Different Fonts, Different Sizes, And Different Colors. I Also Can Make A Label That's More Than One Line On My Computer. Then I Can Save $20.00. But I Still Love This Inexpensive Electronic LabelMaker. The Tape It's Also Easy To Peel."
3,Labelmaker,"Tape sometimes get stuck trying to come out. Tape won't stick on some plastic surfaces. Other than that, does the job."
2,Not a full tube,It was supposed to be a new tube of emollient. It seemed like about a fourth of the tube was missing.
5,Mary Kay Extra Emollient Night Cream,This product is the best for dry skin on any part of your body. I have dry hands and this makes them soft and my hands no longer feel tight or itchie from dry skin.I just love it.
1,This is not Mary Kay!,I did not receive the product pictured. I received a round jar that says Mary Kay and the right name but inside is a pink waxy substance that is HIGHLY FRAGRANCED. Mary Kay is known for no fragrance in their skin care products and no coloring. I just want my money back now!
1,Greasy and gross!,"I decided to try Mary Kay's Extra Emollient Night Cream on my dry feet one night, and I was very turned off by the product. It was greasy and oily, and did not sink into my skin at all. It also had an unpleasant odor. Yuck. I'll definitely not try this product again!"
5,GREAT night cream for hands,Works perfectly. Very thick but that's what I love about it - it's not just an average cream that soaks right in. Makes your hands silky smooth. And I do like the scent. You only need a tiny bit so I expect this tube to last a very long time (my previous tube lasted more than a year of pretty frequent use). So it's a great buy for the price and quality.
5,Mary Kay Night Cream,"I could feel the difference after just one use and I like the packaging, easy to take when traveling. Great night time moisturizer."
5,Great stuff,"I found a tub of this I'd shoved in the back of a drawer years ago because I thought it was too heavy for my face. I was having trouble with dry, cracked winter skin on my heels and feet, and nothing was working. Out of desperation I dug this out of the drawer, rubbed it on my heels, put on some socks and went to bed. The next morning they felt and looked so much better! With repeated use my feet are well on the way to being beach ready for vacation in a few weeks. It works on hands, too - our grandmothers had it right. Slather this on your hands at night and sleep with a pair of cotton gloves - you'll wake up with your hands so much softer.If the formulation is the same (about the consistency of petroleum jelly), try this on your feet, hands, elbows, knees, etc. I'm so glad I found it on Amazon - I'm almost out and I can't live without this stuff in winter!!"
3,not the same container,"I love this product i grew up with my Grandmother using it. I love the smell just for that reason. It also is very great in the winter time if you get severe dry skin on you face and hands. Altough i was not pleased to see that the picture in the discription was not what i had recieved. What I recieved was a tub, the kind you get body butters and such in. It is not as convienent as a tube in my opinion."
2,Not what I expected....,"I love Mary Kay products and have been using them for almost the last year. I was not familiar with the ""Extra Emollient Night Cream"" but I thought I'd give it a try. My fault for not looking into exactly what this stuff was. When I read the word ""cream"" I expected a creamy lotion type product. This is a thick gel-like pink substance that is very greasy. It does say it is for extremely dry skin, but I had no idea it would be more like a gel than a cream. I put it on my face last night and felt like I had just rubbed Crisco on it. Personally, I do not like it, but if you are looking at this product and want an extremely thick greasy gel for your face, it may work for you. As for me, I do not like it (and this is the first Mary Kay product I've used that I did not like)."
5,Have used for over 20 years,"This is the very best night cream for very dry skin. It is non irritating. Significant improvement is seen in just a few applications. As a nurse I also use it on my hands, which take a lot of abuse from constant washing, with great results."
2,More like a comic book than a novel,"While this would be a good book for someone who had not previously read about de Sade's life, it probably won't be of much interest for those who are more familiar with him. This book didn't tell me anything I hadn't already read elsewhere, and I could have done without all the drawings. It wasn't the content of the pictures that bothered me, but the fact that most of the time they took up a majority of the page, and in some cases there were only two or three lines of text. I had expected a few illustrations in a more 18th century style, not something that was mostly all pictures drawn in a more comic book style. For those looking for more well researched ways to learn about de Sade and his life, I would recommend ""Letters From Prison"", ""At Home With the Marquis de Sade"", or ""Must We Burn Sade"". In ""Introducing Marquis de Sade"" there is definitely some interesting artwork, but there is too much of it in most places, to the point where it distracts from the text."
1,Maybe a good magazine - if you can get it,"I subscribed in Sept 04 and still have not received any single issue (as of Jan 05). There is no phone number or email address, so the only way to contact them is by mail, only they don't respond. They took my money, and I never heard from them again.Finally I had enough and subscribed to Garden Gate Magazine instead. They are prompt and efficient, and the magazine is great."
4,Rec'd quickly. Ad states it is overall longer than actual.,"Received order speedily. In the ad, it stated the overall length to be at 1-7/8"" long. However, the one I received is 1-9/16"" long. I would have greatly appreciated it to be the length as advertised. The one I have been using measures 1-3/8"" long and not long enough to safely seat in my router mounted under my workbench, and therefore I ordered the longest one I found available. Many ads do not mention the overall length of router bits...I wish it was a required measurement in all ads."
1,Space Rebellion (Jewel Case),"This is a low grahics game, not what I thought it would be. It's more like the old space invader type games. If you have played Homeworld, Sword of The Stars, or any Star Trex PC games... and like them, you won't like this one. I don't play it, it just takes up space on the shelf."
3,Not quite perfect,"There's a lot good about this, but it doesn't quite gel. James Morris sounds great but he doesn't act well--throughout the negotiations with Loge and the giants he sounds like he's faking it and his expression of fear while being threatened by Alberich is comical. Siegfried Jerusalem seems totally bored by his role from start to finish. Ekkehard Wlaschiha has fine focus and a beautiful top but I don't feel sorry for his Alberich. Maybe he's doing this deliberately, some people think it's more faithful to Wagner to make Alberich purely disgusting but it's overdone here. (Both Morris and Wlaschiha do much better acting in SIEGFRIED.) The best acting here IMHO is done by Matti Salminen, Heinz Zednik, Marianne Haggender and Christa Ludwig. The worst is Jan Hedrik Rootering who let's just say sounds like he might need some viagra to enjoy Freija if he got her.Much better acting in the Boulez video if you can stand the funny ""industrial revolution"" setting and hilarious giants-on-wheels."
1,Disappointing production and performances,"I'm disappointed by the production and the performances. While it's a good idea to stage this opera in a naturalistic manner, the stage direction is disappointing, as can be witnessed from the comical episodes involving the Rhinemaidens and the various transformations by Alberich.The cast fails to do justice to Wagner's score. Morris is hampered by bad stage direction all the way and he is less than dramatically vivid. Ludwig is well past her prime, as is the Alberich. In fact, the other roles are not that well taken, too, with the single exception of Jerusalem's Loge. But a good Loge cannot rescue the entire opera. Levine's slow tempo is also a liability even though the orchestra performed well."
2,Too ugly to be laughed at....,"Wagner's masterful score is well-executed by Levine, if you can ignore the audience, which coughs like it has TB. Visually, this production is atrocious. The Rhine-daughters are about as graceful as three-legged cows and are costumed like cheap mermaid prositutes or fishy spokesmodels for a seafood place. Loge looks like he's wearing Star Trek TNG latex. As he climbs the rock to get the gold, Alberich makes the whole thing wobble like something put together by middle-schoolers for their first production of The Ring. Bad stage direction all around. The only part I think lived up to Wagner's vision was the cool rainbow bridge at the very end, but you can see that by looking at the DVD case. Remind me not to attend the Met. Sounds good but best to watch when blind."
5,"James Morris (Wotan) and Siegried Jerusalem (Loge) rock!- a review of ""Das Rheingold""","I had this on VHS and decided one day to show it to my 5 year-old daughter. She likes princesses and fantasy and what-not and I was wondering what she would make of Alberich and the Rhein Maidens. Well, she LOVED them -- and this video became an instant hit. So much so that we recently forked over considerable dough and purchased the full DVD Wagner set.As to the criticism of the costuming, I can only say that I always liked it and that my princess-daughter thought it was 'just right'. [Princesses' do know these things - lol.]Five Stars. Lovely production. Great sound quality. Some of Wagner's best stuff. Das Rheingold also features a story line and music that children like.Notes for Parents: Opera is loaded with innuendo, violence, and other non-child friendly material. Das Rheingold by opera standards is pretty tame, having only a little ""V""."
3,Halvah tasty but greasy,"The half-pound sealed packages are convenient and secure. However, they don't let the halvah ""breathe,"" and the result is rather too oily for my taste. The halvah tastes fine but I find its texture too soft, not grainy as it should be."
5,INSPIRATIONAL BLUES!!,"I dont know how Im just getting to hear this CD....It is excellent listening to uplifting inspirational blues!! Its not cry in your beer music!! You feel good listening to any of the songs on this cd or any of the NRPs cds!I am lucky and have got to see Nobby and the Project, Ray Bushey on bass and Eric Belrose on drums, play live!! I was impressed with the bands tightness and if you ever get the chance to see these guys live........go!!"
4,"If you got this far, you can't stop now......","The final chapter in the Ring Cycle, as done by the Metropolitan Opera conducted by James Levine. This is a fine offering. Of particular highlight is Hildegard Behrens portrayal as the spurned Brunehilde. A surprise was Christa Ludwig's fine performance, not as Fricka, but as a Valkyrie (a role I enjoyed very much). The story itself ties up a lot of loose ends....Also great performance of Siegfried's death march. Definitely worth watching if you've gotten this far."
3,Almost a musical disaster,"Unfortunally,beautiful set and costumes in asatisfactory DVD transfer can`t save this productionfrom musical mediocrity.Levine,Behrens and Jerusalemseems like to play the opera without any rehersal,the scene four on act two is a real disaster.Of coursesome singers are in excellent shape:Salminen,Ludwigand Wlaschiha just are doing their best,but who canignore Behrens`scenic weakness and Jerusalem`s dirtyvocal tone?She acts sometimes like if she was drunkbut not under any poisons.Her immolation(Levine guilty?)is so fast that I can imagine so many jokes why Grane,the Brunhilde`s horse isn`t on the stage.I will give3 stars just there are a lot of very good professionalsbehind the Met`s curtains."
2,A lame effort,"The opera is supposed to be the climax of Wagner's Ring cycle. Unfortunately, the performance here is rather inadequate, which detracts from the majesty of the opera.The production is traditional (which is good) but badly directed. The singers are either left with no direction to hang onto, or they are merely able to fill the acting requirements with half-hearted stock gestures. Their singing is unremarkable, in particular Hildegard Behrens's strained Brunnhilde.Levine and his orchestra are quite admirable, although I've heard them on better forms. All in all, it's quite a lame effort."
3,"""Not Up ToThe Task""",The Met Opera orchestra is phenomenal as always.Gotterdammerung calls for a vocal powerhouse in its Brunnhilde. It is the pivotal role for the success of this opera. Ms. Behrens was not that Brunnhilde.You've read the other reviewers assessments of her deficiencies. Was there something political involved in her getting the role? Waltraud Meier would have been a better choice.I was particularly impressed with the vocal dynamics of 1St Norn Gweneth Bean. I also enjoyed her as Dryade in the Met production of Strauss' Ariadne Auf Naxos.I'd like to see what she could do with bigger roles.Behrens truly was the weakest link.Bye-Bye.
2,UUUUGGGHHHH AWFUL,"Absolutelly agree with GUNTRAM'S review Behrens and Jerusalem should have been at their homes instead of singing this Ring cycle, the same as Levine. He makes no difference while directing Rossini, Wagner or other composer. After I bought the DVD I thought to throw it away, but I kept it just for the small part where sings Chrtista Ludwig who did it absolutelly great. Do not waste your money in this ring cycle.Die Walkure worth for the Jessye Norman's Sieglinde and in the second act Christa Ludwig's Fricka....... Buy the Boulez Ring with the Dame Gwyneth Jones' Brunhilde and there you will see what is a real Bunhilde. It is a Pity that Nilsson never was taped in this role."
4,"Good, but narration is bad.","I would recommend this. Even though some people probably think that narration to a movie makes it more serene, Michael Gettel's music is serene enough. The beautiful photography of nature makes this a wonderful pick for those who want something to make them relax."
4,Time-lapsed nature photography is wonderful,"I have purchased several nature DVDs and this ranks as one of the best in quality of sound and visual production.If you enjoy time-lapsed photography and its artistic effects on water and sky in particular, you will enjoy this.I could have done without the narrative although it was minimal and only at the beginning of each section. The new-age music was appropriate and well done."
1,Misdirection in several ways,"This is not a scholarly book, nor even a sensationalized potboiler in the tradition of Hans Holzer, Jess Stearn, or the fictional Sidney Redlitch. It's a comic book...and even ""Dennis the Menace Visits Mexico"", a twenty-five-cent Super-Giant published around 1960, showed a better understanding and explication of a country and its culture andhistory, and had better art besides."
2,Not what I expected,"This product was not what I expected it to be. My 9 year old son is very much into the Civil War, this would have been a great present for him if it had been easier to work with. The project was very hard and time consuming. It did not look as represented. Not happy at all."
5,Yet another Fantastic Snappy Book!,"This is a great book! Each page has a different dinosaur, rhyming text, the dinosaur's name and a pronunciation key for the names. The pop-ups are first class (as always with Snappy books)! A favorite in our house!"
1,Very Good LIE,"I ordered this book from Hastings because it said it was in VERY GOOD condition. That was a complete lie. The binding was broken, pages were missing, and the ones that were there looked and smelled horrible. I will never order from them again, and due to the extreme poor condition this book was in I will think twice when ordering used from anyone else."
2,Failure to Launch,"Aashiqui.in Movie is directed by Shakhadeep and main roles in the movie are played by Ishaan Manhaas, Ankita Shrivastava, Dheeraj Miglani, Tiya Gandwani, Shubhi Ahuja, Deepan Shah, Sharmila Joshi, Priti Gandwani etc. Aashiqui.in is a modern day story revolving around relations on the internet. Aashiqui.in is a comedy romance movie and is expected to appeal to audience in metrosDespite being slandered, its not a bad film and is a good watch when a person has nothing better to do."
3,Major flaws....,"The major flaw is the inability of the software to change the default settings for file location. All of the TV recordings are saved in the ""My Video"" folder. This is stored on the ""C"" drive. If you have partitioned your hard drive and reduced the ""C"" drive store then you'll find the ""C"" drive will fill up quickly!I wrote the company and they say they are working on a patch to allow the user to decide where to store the downloaded video files.A minor complaint is that the windows don't retain the location on the screen when opening and closing the program.My software came bundled with the new ATI TV Elite card, but it's the same version 3."
1,It sucks.,"This shredder sucks. It worked for a little while, then as soon as there's a paperjam it overheats, won't reverse, won't move or anything. I only put in 6 pages so I don't know what the big effing deal is. Now it's just a piece of junk, because to be able to unscrew the top off you need a special long, skinny screwdriver, which I obviously don't have at my office.So needless to say, don't bother, just invest more money on a better quality product."
2,Jams constantly,"I've had this for years. It ""works"", but I tear my hair out unjamming it every third time I use it. UGH"
1,Not what I wanted,"It was a crushing disappointment, primarily because I didn't know what I was getting and what I got was not remotely what I wanted. I used it once and put it back in the box. I intend to try reselling it on e-bay."
3,Adidas Team Bag,The bag is a good size and my son uses it every day for his basketball stuff. The only thing I am disappointed about is that the zipper in the center of the large area of the bag has already broken. I wish the zippers were better quality.
2,Disappointed,"The material for this study was good, but the questions asked in the guide were redundant. They did not inspire thinking. Read the Bible reference, answer the question. No thought required. Done other Women of Faith studies that were done better."
5,Good for bible study,"I teach bible studies at my church and even though this book is from the Women of Faith study series, us guys can learn from it too and it was perfect for my discussions"
5,I love these cups.,"The colors are beautiful and the cups are just the right size for a generous cup of morning coffee. They are definitely dish-washer safe. I've washed mine several times and it still looks as good as the first day I received it. The stand makes the cups easily acessible in my cupboard, without taking up a lot of shelf space."
5,Outstanding book for women!,"I am thrilled with the book. I pick it up everyday and just randomly open it to any page and it is inspiring, motivating, and just what I needed for that day! I would recommend it to any woman who wants to nurture her mind, body, soul, and her inner child. You will honor the woman inside you by purchasing this book!"
1,Coming Home to Myself,Too much rehash of the author's former work plus a secondary author added her prose and it was not the quality of the author's so felt mislead and even more disappointed.
2,Save Your $,"Forget it folks, this is nothing more than a bad game with a lot of hyped up pictures on the box.I love RTS games and would play them all day if it paid. But if you really enjoy RTS games this is a real disappointment. The best way I can describe it, IRRITATING! No resource management hardly, no base defense, and quite frankly most missions take 2-5 tries even on ""EASY"" I suppose part of me held this game to a C&C; Generals type game but oh well, I played, I cried, I spent more than three dollars."
3,"Nice effects, horrible realism","If you like nice graphics and cool effects - go for it. If you are looking for realism, well don't. Since when does an Abrams need three hits to crack a BMP? And since when does an Abrams tank shoot only as far as city block is long?If you want the 'real thing' stick to the old 'Close Combat' series."
4,Slow but very interesting,"I bought this game a few days ago and so far, It's been really interesting. I am a huge fan of C&C; games and this one is quite close but a bit more realistic. You actually run out of amo and you need to call in supplies which ads to the ""excitment"" of the game.Go for it... It's a good game.Ramy"
4,Great time filler!,"Bought this game for a great price. Worth every penny in my opinion. It's not the greatest strategy game out there but I find myself on the edge of my seat sometimes. The equipment/technology in game is actually real military equipment, and in very good detail. The story line adds a little bit of more fun into it. I'd say go for it. For the price, you really can't go wrong with it."
5,very good product,"easy to set up,easy to use very clear photocopy both black and color,nice printer not too noise and the colors very good,for the price is really a good decision to make.buy it."
1,Waste of time,"I bought the Rosetta Stone to learn Farsi and didn't find it useful. Before buying this I used the Pimsleur CDs which were very helpful for conversational Farsi. It even helped me aquire the accent. The Rosetta Stone makes you guess at everything. It will show you pictures and then say the word in Farsi and you're supposed to guess which picture it talks about. The frustrating part is that there could be several things in the picture, example: ball, boy, tree--and it doesn't tell you which one is the actual word that you heard. I've taken private lessons and now have a great foundation to try this again. I find it a huge waste of time and money though."
3,Slow going,Maxwell & Delaney is better conceptually. And Winer is just work whereas Maxwell & Delaney is a pleasure. I would give Winer more stars if I didn't have the better alternative book though.
3,Stalker!!!,"The book ""The Girlfriend"" is a thriller about a girl who will do anything to have the high-school quarterback, Scotty. Scotty and his girlfriend Lora are the perfect couple. But, when Lora goes away on a 1 week vacation to Paris, Scotty mingles with a hot girl he's never seen before. He asks the girl(her name is Shannon) to go get a burger with him, and soon, the peaceful date turns into a wild make-out session. Soon after, when Lora returns from her trip, Scotty tries to make it clear to Shannon that it was just a fling. She will not take no for an answer. She begins to stalk Scotty, doing anything to have him as her man. She does terrible things like:Slicing his snake in half, burning his car, killing Lora's cat, crashing parties, and threatening to tell Lora about their rendevous. This book was ok. If Shannon were to be a little more dangerous, like, maybe, kidnap Lora or something, it would be better."
3,Read it for school,"I read this book for summer reading.It is not one of R.L. Stine's best, but it is decent. The ending is sorta retarted and there is really no mystery in the book.You may E-Mail me with your thoughts on this book."
3,A shocking ending,"The Girlfriend by R.L. Stine was an okay novel with a shocking ending. It's great for girls that are around twelve years old; they will enjoy it the most.It is about a popular boy whose girlfriend goes on vacation, so he makes a new temporary girlfriend. But, the temporary girlfriend is crazy about him...."
2,Let-down,A boy fools around when his girl friend is away. Soon he finds that the new girl will stop at nothing to get with him.I didn't like this one. It could be mostly that I found Scott to be very unsympathetic. Either way it never caught my interest and I ended up skimming ahead.
3,Can She Ever Go Away?,"Scotty's long-time, really close girlfriend, Lora, goes away for the weekend. While she's gone, Scotty meets a short, beautiful red head named Shannon. Shannon and Scotty go on one date, just one! After that, Shannon wouldn't leave Scotty alone. She would do ANYTHING to get Scotty to leave Lora for her. Like R. L. Stine put it...Lora just loves Scotty to DEATH!"
4,It's Good But Not All That!,"The Girlfriend wasn't all that good but it is kinda. It's about a boy name Scotty. His girlfriend went on a 1 - week vacation. Then why she was gone, he met a gyrl and took her out to lunch and then she went out of control when he tried to breakup with her. It's good but not all that.That's why I mild gave it 4 stars."
2,U pins not sturdy,"I purchased these ""Tidy Pins/U pins"" as I was not sure I could get some more Dritz ones. For my purpose they are not sturdy enough. Kept then as it wa going to cost more to ship them back than they cost. Maybe some day I will find a use for them."
1,Already written in it.,I waited for this book and then when I recieved it there was writing with a pen in it. I am a substance abuse specialist and I need to make copies of this book for some of my clients and I can't. I was very disappointed and I was not able to return because my husband opened the box and threw all paper work away.
2,Accecptable book,"While this book may be a little old, there's still a some relevant information. However I don't think the author ever had a safety lesson in his life. Don't get this book for anything besides a basic reference book on scultpure."
3,Let the buyer beware....,"Short story - book was listed as published in October of 2010. Expected to see LOTS of up to date information when I bought it. Most data STOPS around 2006 with the Rapide ""Concept"" which has been in production nearly 3 years. The PRE 2006 information is good; really expected a ""home-run"" since I thought I was buying the newest and best."
1,Ouch,"Dear lord, save your money. I'm a pretty hairy guy and this stuff hurt really bad. I bought it with the intention of using it on my chest and back. I got about half way done with my stomach until the pain was too much to handle. For all the pain, it didn't even remove all the hair. There was no bleeding or anything but good lord it was painful. If I were you and you have medium to heavy body hair consider shaving it or something else."
1,"1 star for the singer, 3 stars for the accompaniment.","I thought Julie Cruise (American singer) has a breathless and raspy voice, wait until you hear Loren Auerbach. Cruise at least sings in pitch most of the time, and occasionally do some inflection to the lyrics. Auerbach's voice is plain monotone, and she sounds like chanting rather than singing 99% of the time. That naturally kills all the joy of listening to Bert Jansch's decent background accompaniment and arrangement."
3,Not what you ordered,While this tire does replace a 13 X 5 it is not a 13 X 5 it is actually a 13 X 4 which you can purchase for half this price. It works on my cart but save your money and buy the 13 x 4 version or go elsewhere to get an actual 13 X 5. You will save $10.00 so don't be scammed like me.
4,Try UO.,"I've played almost every game out there for online gaming and THIS (uo) is where it all started... thanks to this game we now have OTHER onlile games...Like it or hate it- UO is the godfather of online gaming. That said.I've play this game longer then most people (on and off for 7 years) this game is NOT as dull as everyone thinks it is, there is SO much more then meets the eye, So much is hidden. the friends and gruops of people you will meet and get to know is amazing. Its not how GREAT the gif's are by today standereds they do suck...But its about the quality of game play and the freedeom you get from playing UO.Enjoy."
1,Outdated,"Outdated graphics, 4+ years and still buggy, overcrowded and lag filled servers. UO was good for its time, but its time has long passed, it belongs in the bargin bin at your local K-Mart. 4+ years of development and still the most bug filled online game out there, I would give this one a miss and try Everquest, or Dark Ages."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,You have to pay a monthly fee and the graphics are pathetic.There is no decent help screens. There are lags in the time to perform actions. I played Ultima IV years ago on a apple IIc and it was better then this version.
4,Game,I think this game is ok and I would suggest that people who want a reality game they should get this game because it is very relistic. ThaxSpace
2,"Ultima Online, is it REALLY worth it?","I played this game for over 3 years. I’ve seen it come from a simply wonderful game, to the mistake it has become. I highly recommend you get this game if you enjoy the following:LagLack of help from the game mastersBug exploiters by the thousandsFoul actions and abundant crowds of insulting people.This game has lost it's steam, I don't recommend it to anyone."
1,AWFULL AND BORING!!!!,This game is an insult to all PC games. There are no quests and no point to it at all. Plus u need to pay a server ounce u get it. (if your lucky you might find a free server.) Basicilly if you want a cool fantasy game with knights and magic go get Diablo2 because you'll enjoy it much much more!!!!
1,An in joke that falls very flat indeed,"If brevity's the soul of wit, this 121-page wheeze is still too long. Smug author thinks it's a laff riot to invert standard advice (single-space your manuscripts, never revise a word, demand $1,000,000 in your query letters . . . are we getting the joke yet?). Soon, even author herself grows bored, starts satirizing romance novels and anything else within her limited reach--in a nonstop, archly overwritten style.The only valid lesson this book teaches is what it might to be like to be being trapped in an elevator with Dame Edna on speed."
1,It really is that bad.,"No redeeming qualities. This is the only book I've ever thrown away. I don't want anyone else to read this. It's not worth the paper it's printed on. Is it satire? Parody? It's neither. It's not funny, there seems to be some underlying character being implied, a cynical publisher, someone burnt out on the world of publishing, but it misses the mark. It misses many marks. It misses all the marks. One positive note: It will give you courage to write, because anyone can do it better than this. Poorly thought out misguided attempt. Disappointing."
1,A Parody should be called a parody,I'd feel different about this book if it had been clearly labeled a parody. But you can't very well pillory an industry for targeting gullible wannabes immune to listening and do the same thing yourself without being labeled the worst sort of hypocrite.
3,This is one nasty book!,"This is one bitter woman! God help the neophyte who gets hold of this one. There is truth here, but it is couched in satire. Funny stuff, though, some of it. Too long, but not bad."
4,Satire! Read with a dose of cynic!,"Some negative reviewers just do not get that this is written with the intention of being satire, plain and simple. It is a fun jab to people who do know about publishing. It cuts to the ribs. There are some truths in it, if you are wise enough to read it as it's intended, so many words of advice that publishers give new writers, only to be ignored, so many hoops to run through, yet again dismissed as not true by some... no wonder this author cut the rug at them! lol If you take offense, then you didn't read it for its intended purpose, to be complete tomfoolery, but if you know about publishing and know the many ins and outs, then you'll get a good laugh for less than a buck."
1,NOT FUNNY.,"This bitter diatribe is anything but funny. Bitter failed writers are pitiful, not funny, and this book must have been written by one. This book dumps on everybody involved in publishing and viciously. According to Rovenhauer, agents, publishers, editors, bestselling writers are all out for money first, last and always, and that's just absurd. No, unless you're bitter yourself you don't want to read something so like a bite into a lemon."
2,I laughed until I stopped.,"Although I enjoy a bit of mean spirited satire, the author just doesn't seem to know where to leave off a joke. While I did find myself laughing out loud in places, those laughs were few and far between, and the rest of it was a verbal elbow to the ribs.Yes, I get it. You don't like publishers and bad romance novels. You can stop punching that dead nag in the face."
3,The Man is Trembling.,"""A Reader"" from 2001 either works for the industry or was off her meds..5 or was it 6 different reviews? Fight the power.Steal this book."
5,STEVEN KING MOVE OVER!,"For those writers no longer dewy eyed at the prospect of impending bestsellerdom, this book is an antidote to all the books pandering to the neophyte's hunger for fame. Bitter? sure it is. For the writer true to himself and lacking connections there is plenty cause for bitterness. This evil little book lances the wound."
1,Don't Pay for this Book,"This book was an opportunity for its author to vent, and prop themselves up by mocking... pretty much anybody. Imagine a bitter, unpleasant lady getting home from a terrible job that was legitimately difficult, and then what she would want to say, for hours, to get it off her chest. This book is sort of like that, only it costs a dollar.At times funny, it is witheringly negative and self-satisfied. 'Nasty' is appropriately the largest thing in the title."
3,Not up to par...,"I had high hopes for this CD. Just hoping that it could live up to the greatness of Chapters 2&3, but it falls short. The opening track ""Music I Like"" is genius however. Fabulous Faber did a great job with it. ""Blue Moon"" and ""Excitement"" that follow are also great tracks, but from there, we run into some not to great tracks. The energy and feeling just isn't there! Plus, we've heard all of these! Frolic's choice of mixes are right on. DNA & Breeze's mix of ""Take It From The Groove"" is IMO the best. Scott Brown's mix of ""Space Invader"" also a great choice. I think people were looking for something new and shocking. Stir up the scene a little bit. This is not that CD. But, it does have those stellar tracks on there. Pick it up if you're more into the trancier elements of happy hardcore. Here are the best tracks on the CD: Take It From The Groove, Music I Like, Excitement, Blue Moon, Stay With Me, Space Invader."
2,Disappointing,"Unlike the other reviewers here, I am very disappointed with this album. Now, granted, I am into ultimate cheese. I expect Bonkers every time I purchase a happycore album. This is not it. Strangely, nearly every song starts off slammin, then (in my opinion) takes a nosedive.If you enjoy some good 'ol cheese, do not buy this album."
2,Awwwwww...,"I think this is probably my least favorite disc in the Happy Hardcore series. Pretty much ever song on here seems very flat and weak/hollow compared to any of the songs on the other cds.As another reviewer pointed out, there is definately not enough ""cheese"" on here...its too serious. Even the Scott Brown and Bang! tracks are weak in my opinion...the only reason it gets 2 stars is because it belongs to one of the coolest series of cds ever.Hmmm...its kinda tough to write a review for a cd you dont like. I wil say this...Every once in a while I'll pop it back in to see if it might grow on me, but it always falls way short:( Anyway, if you're want to get into Happy Hardcore get #3 or #6 in the series. Get this one last, if at all, or it may discourage you from buying the rest of 'em."
5,Divertido - Lots of Fun,"Abuelo y los Tres Osos is a retelling of Goldilocks and the Three Bears. It's told by a Mexican grandfather, and includes Mexican details like beans instead of porridge, and a dark-haired, pig-tailed Goldilocks.The best part of the book is its two versions. Both versions seem independent of each other. Both Spanish and English are fluent, without any of the usual mistranslations. Even if you're tired of Rebecca Emberley's dumb bilingual books, or rather, because you're tired of them, Abuelo y Los Tres Osos is very much worth a try."
4,good times head banging,This is a pretty good solid state overall. If you are into the roster right now on solid state this is a pretty good representation of what the new cd's are like. It was nice to hear becoming the archetype's new song before the album is even released. THe only reason I gave this album 4 stars is because i don't like a few of the songs (only like 2 of them) and the last demon hunter track my heart strings come undone the acoustic version didn't really flow with the rest of the cd. Other than that it is great. I got mine for 6 dollars so i can't complain!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,celtic agate earrings,they fell apart three times on me and they kept replacing the actual hook for the earring. They look pretty cheap though not as nice as they looked on the site
4,Sterling silver Celtic knot emerald green earrings,"These dangly earrings are very pretty but stones are much smaller than I expected them to be. All in all, I was a little disappointed with my purchase, but, surprisingly, got compliments the first time I wore them."
3,Nice story but falls a little short,"It is nice to see a ""real life"" problem for younger children discussed in picture book format.Even though there is no real ""story"" going on in this book - Daisy is a middle child whose family doesn't listen to her; she decides to spend the night at her friend Rosa's house; her family thinks she has gone missing and when they finally find Daisy and resolve to take her home Daisy finds her voice and her family starts to pay attention - young children will identify with Daisy's frustrations and find pleasure in the end result.The author has taken care to show that despite Daisy's family's dismissal of her voice, they do care for her and are looking out for her best interests. Winthrop has also been careful to resolve the issue without making too much of a ""storybook"" ending out of it.A nice read, but not a book with elaborate illustrations or story telling that will make them say, ""Wow!"". A good choice for libraries."
4,"Great collection, but author needs a fact checker.","I recommend this collection of epitaphs because they give a fascinating insight into the lives and deaths of past New Englanders. However, on page one of the author's commentary, I was stunned to see her erroneous statement that Benjamin Franklin was a Quaker!Benjamin Franklin was not a Quaker. He was baptized in 1706, at the Old South Church congregation's Cedar Meeting House on downtown Washington Street, Boston. In Philadelphia he occasionally worshiped at Christ Church, the Church of England parish established in colonial Philadelphia in 1695 and later reorganized into the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of America.Because of this factual error, I found it difficult to trust the accuracy of the commentary and hence, the author's analysis. But, her collection is most excellent and for that reason, the reader will be rewarded."
1,"WOW, I mean... what the heck???","Frat Party is worse than I ever could have imagined. I wasn't exactly expecting top notch acting skills or a complex storyline, but this movie is so utterly pointless and accomplishes absolutely *nothing* that the many, many topless girls is honestly the only reason one could even have in watching it. It's flat out terrible.Don't even try to convince me that the marriage is supposed to be good enough to qualify as a storyline segment because this particular aspect of the movie only takes up a small amount of time. The REST of the storyline is about a young college man walking around campus and hitting on girls. That's it.Truth be told, if this movie fell under the category of a porno instead of a supposed comedy, it'd be more logical. I will admit that I enjoyed the girls. I can't possibly deny that because they were beautiful and plentiful, but come on, that's the only thing Frat Party has going for it, seriously."
2,Lacking the Hammond Mystique,"Fred Hammond is a unique gift to the Body of Christ. However, I must agree with the comments from Chicago. This project does not measure up to the standard that we're use to with Hammond. I am a rabid fan of Hammonds. In fact it goes beyond fan. His music ministers to me as deeply as the best anointed sermon. God has used His music to carry me during trials, to deepen me in my relationship with Christ, and to give me perspective when the devil tries so hard to confuse me. In my home, in my car and in my office, you'll hear Fred Hammond. With my wife and kids, with family and friends, you'll hear Fred Hammond. So I was disappointed and perplex when I got this CD. Most of the songs sound the same and they seem to lack that unique touch of the Spirit that has become marquee with Hammond. I know that with Fred's music, I have to sometimes give it time for my soul to warm up to it. But I don't believe this project will grow on me."
2,Classic Fred,"I just bought this album and I waited a while because I saw one review of the album when it was just released stating that it was not very good. Well, after hearing You Are My Live (#6) on the WOW 2006 album, I simply had to get it and I am not in the least disappointed. Fred Hammond is truly anointed to worship. Anyone who truly loves God would love this CD. As with every other Fred Hammond CD, the words to each song are simply DEEP and can only be a reflection of someone who has a special personal relationship with God and spends time in his presence. BRAVO FRED!"
2,HE RUSHED THIS ONE,THIS ALBUM SOUNDS RUSHED.... LOOKS AS IF HE WAS PRESSED TO HAVE SOMETHING OUT ...... Quality is better than Quanity.... Try it again Fred.....
2,What in the world?,"Like all of the other people submitting reviews of this album, I am a huge fred Hammond fan. However, I was very disappointed with his latest effort. The album did not evoke any emotion, stir my Spirit, or usher me into the Lord's presence. Fred's vocals seem uninspired and, while I acknowledge the gift God has giving Fred and don't doubt his annointing, this album is not indicative of this. Sorry, but most of these songs wouldn't even be good ""filler"" material on his previous albums. I long for, and am praying for the return of the ""modern-day psalmist."""
2,"These people must not have ""Pages of Life""","I bought this album and gave it away within a week. I am the biggest FRED fan. However, like gregory in the previous writing said, Fred doesn't seem to be into the songs. I thought that he was going to go back to that old school praise and worship, but he didn't! I was soooo upset with Fred. The studio work is poor quality,(and I'm not even musically inclined) and the music was not composed with much thought. There has been no other since Pages of Life and Spirit of David. I hope Fred reads this. WE need you Fred!! I'll still support you! However, I suggest that people listen to the songs b4 buying the CD. Sorry Fred."
4,Fresh New Fred!,"If you're expecting the ""regular"" Radical For Christ CD, you'll be in for a bit of an awakening. I was uncomfortable upon the initial hearing of this offering. But as I started to listen to the lyrics I discovered the strength of this CD. This CD seems to have a more of a ""personal"" flavor to it. This is definitely an offering of praise to our God. Good work Fred, as usual. The band is tight as usual, and Fred's bass playing is exceptional. (I'm a bass player, myself)peace,Mike"
5,Another example of why I love Fred Hammond!,One thing that I have always loved about Fred Hammond is the fact that his music changes to reflect where he is in God at the time. There has not been one song that I have not enjoyed and that has not ministered to me deeply. I am so thankful to have Fred Hammond in the body of Christ. I highly recommend this CD!
5,....the deep things of God (1Corinthians 2:10),"The Holy Spirit truly has revealed the deep things of God through His modern day David (Fred Hammond) The Psalmist on this latest project ""Speak Those Things: POL Chapter 3"". Fred truly is a worshipper and he understands that they that worship the Father must worship Him in Spirit and in Truth. When you buy this CD I encourage you not only to listen to the music, but pull the lyrics out and sing along that you also may enter in. All praise, honor, and glory be unto God for ministering to us through His vessel once again."
5,Did Fred see my life and know I needed this CD?,"If you've never gone through or are not in the mist of something so big that you know the only way out was God or doubted that there was a way of escape, then you won't feel this cd. Praise & Worship is the only way out of the battle and this cd shows you how to praise him when all you want to do is give up. If you have no song to sing to the Lord, Fred has given you 15 songs to sing. These songs resonate with truth and you can tell that they were birth from personal experiences. If you haven't had the opportunity to experience a ""wilderness period"", get this cd and hide the words in your heart because sooner or later you will need these songs and God's word to speak life into your situation."
5,SPEAK THOSE THINGS WILL CERTAINLY SPEAK TO YOUR HEART!,"Fred's music has had such an anointing on my life. On this CD, he takes gospel music to another level and he gives you a great combination of fast and slow tracks. After you think it can't get any better, he continues to raise the bar on each and every song. I love it and would suggest this CD to anyone...not just gospel music fans. Opening this CD will also open up your heart and take you to a place of solace. Whether you're going thru, just came thru or you're about to go thru...this is the CD that will keep you uplifted."
3,Love Fred But Very Poor Sound Quality,"I love every song on this CD, but the sound quality is very poor. I rated as ok only because of the sound quality."
5,"All you have to say is """"""FRED"""""""""""" and that's it!!!!!!!!!!",My favorite artist hands down. So he'll always have at lest 1 sale at all times...... Keep blessing Gods people
4,Spiritual in a native American way,"My wife being native American can resonate with this. She is actually the reader for this book. It contained their journeys, and as she would say, many metaphors inside of metaphors. She said it was a good read."
4,Zizzo Masters Gershwin Touch,"Alicia Zizzo, one of the foremost Gershwin experts of our day, has selected many famous and lesser known pieces and made them sing. The touch is absolutely amazing, an aspect most musicians (including myself) have never been able to attain when playing this difficult composer's works. She makes it sound so easy.When I compared my recording of Gershwin playing his own stuff (Gershwin Plays Gershwin: The Piano Rolls) to Ms. Zizzo I was amazed to find that not only does she perfectly follow the mood Gershwin intended, but also throws in a few of her own interpretave surprises.Even though Rhapsody in Blue and An American in Paris get long after 16 min, the rest of the songs, including Blue Monday (Actually better than Rhapsody in Blue), Novellete in Fourths, and the Preludes, are wonderful. This CD is perfect for background music while you're working, or even just listening while in the car. This is one of my favorite CDs that I own."
1,Zizzo has not a clue as to the HEART of Gershwin's music,"If you are looking for a stilted, non-rhythmic performance that lacks drive and momentum, along with reverb that would choke a horse, this album is definately for you! Its hard to believe that Zizzo has edited the newest edition of Gershwin's works. Perhaps her mainstream classical playing is better."
2,"Good reference book, poor learning tool.","While Messer shows good logic on how to impliment proofs, he fails to make good definitions of common terms. Most of the in text examples have nothing to do with the chapter they are in and are often so over simplified that it is impossible to extend the idea. The only reason that this book gets 2 stars is because it has a decent answer section."
2,Long Delivery Time,"I didn't realize that the seller was shipping from overseas at first, so I was a little surprised at the late delivery date estimate. Once I realized where the book was coming from, it made more sense. However, the delivery was significantly delayed--I finally received the item nearly two months after I ordered it, and almost a month after it was expected to arrive. So, while the book was in good condition, the delivery could have been faster."
2,Full of Mistakes and Poorly Organized,"After having taken a course, then later helped teach a course (University level) using this book I found that it is full of mistakes and difficult to read. Not recommended as an introductory text. The book may serve acceptably as an reference, but it is not a great teaching tool.Instructors take notice that the electronic solutions to the problem sets have many errors. There are also many errors not acknowledged in the book's errata. (Errata hasn't been updated for 1 year)."
4,Good introduction book for communications network,"This book is good for electrical or computer engineering people as a good start. Actually this book is related to both computer networks and digital communications, like a good overview, also including new technology stuff, such as IEEE 802.11, DWDM."
2,white rubs off on clothing and hands,"I have very long dark hair (about 3 ft.) and wanted to make a white streak down it. Sprayed this on and it does make hair white. Not sure if it is a colored hair spray or what. I waited for a hour to let it set. But when I braided the section that I sprayed the white came off onto my hands. The product also made my hair feel dry, like straw and it did not shine like healthy hair. Got worried it might rub onto my clothing. It did. I wore a black shirt that night and it did get onto the shirt. Maybe this would work better with short hair that wouldn't be hanging on clothing. It does wash out easily. Getting caught in the rain may be a problem. Will not use again."
4,"Timeless, Timely Writing Tips","Moira Allen's book, The Writer's Guide to Queries, Pitches & Proposals is an easy read, but one filled with the necessary rules and resources writers need to get their work into print. She has gone to experts in several areas of writing for articles that are helpful, concise and to the point, and yes, timely in a timeless kind of way. I first read about this book in Hope Clark's Funds for Writers online resource and have found it to be everything she said it would be. I would recommend it especially to writers new to print who can't wait years and years to obtain the knowledge held within its pages."
1,A very bad DVD !,Please note the DVD is of very bad quality.This 1960 film film is worst than an unrestored movie of the 20ies.There is even a graphic (1 or 2 numbers) incrustation in the middle of the screen for very long minutes during the movie.Save your money for serious DVD editors.
3,No Going Back meets 1984,"Yes, of course he does go back. But a lot of it is about the joys and tribulations of living in a Tuscan farmhouse. That's the better part in fact.It's the dictatorial, poverty-stricken Britain he gets railroaded back to that I don't buy. How did it happen - nothing like 1970, man! George Orwell did it so much better.Raymond's only real political idea seems to be that giving power to the lower orders turns them into little Hitlers."
2,Mediocre.,Not a good novel. Even beyond the relentlessly implausible plot and Cook's attempt to ramrod home his philosophy (change is bad) the writing is terrible.Frankly Cook should have stuck to selling lingerie.
5,Coltrane for Lovers,"Perfect for a romantic evening, a quiet drive, or just as background music.Coltrane is the ""Man""Gret selections. In fact, until I purchased this CD, I did not realize there was a series of jazz musicians with the ""For Lovers"" theme.Thanks for the Memories"
4,A solid collection,"This is a really nice collection of 'love' songs. I would have given it five stars, but given the capacity of compact discs this cd could be even longer. I'm surprised ""Naima"" isn't here from ""Giant Steps"". Coltrane wrote it for his wife and it's a beautiful tune. Most of the songs here sound right in place, especially those from his collaboration with Johnny Hartman. Pleasant and soothing."
4,A great mystery,"""But Vickie who's blood could it be?"" said Joanie after they ran away from home to visit their dad. When the girls get there and find that their dad is not home they go looking for him in the apartment. With the help of Jake, the boy upstairs, they find several spots on the floor covered in blood. When they see strange men in the alley they get suspicious and wonder where their dad might be. Is their dad all right and what are the men doing in the alley?This book is full of suspense. It keeps you on the edge of your seat and makes you keep reading to see what happens next. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to sit down and read a good mystery because you will definitely enjoy this action-filled story!"
4,good,i think this was a good choice for me. saved me lots of $$ on the newer edition. would recommend.
4,"Got lots of recommendation, now I know why..",get it ... it a goo book. you just need to use it ... lol
1,"MANY MISTAKES, don't believe everything you read.","This edition is OK if you can catch all of the several mistakes. THE FOLLOWING CORRECTIONS SHOULD BE MADE: 1. Table 1-33, Bart's is an abnormal hemoglobin composed of 4 gamma chains (not 4 Beta). 2. Table 1-37, IVIG is NOT a treatment for TTP but it IS a treatment for ITP. 3. Table 3-13, a benign tumor of the ovary is a cystadenOMA, NOT a cystadenoCARCINOMA. 4. Table 5-13, Dog bites that are ""provoked"" are LESS likely to be associated with rabies while unprovoked bites are more associated with rabies. 5. Table 1-15, Squamous cell carcinoma (not small cell as the book claims) is associated with hypercalcemia due to secretion of PTHrp. These mistakes are MAJOR. Who knows how many more there are. . .that I missed. If you can't trust SOME of the information, how can you trust ANY of it?"
4,Helps to finish the steps with a bang,"Dear 3rd step givers, you are almost there. You have conquered 2 steps and one CSA and now its time for final showdown. You would really like to finish off with a bang.This book might just help you achieve that. It is written in an easy and flowing manner which helps to digest and absorb the material given. The charts and diagrams are very helpful.Most importantly it is closer to what is asked in the actual exam. My advise to those who are looking for a good, concise and uptodate review book for STEP 3....PLEASE GO FOR BOARDS AND WARDS. because it helps you pass the final step with a bang"
5,Excellent Source - Easy Read,"I used this book for Step2 CK. I had about a month to study, and read the book once in the first week and again skimmed it in the last few days. It reads relatively easily - though looks quite dense at first sight. Good charts/graphs. Did pretty well in the end, though don't know if it was the result of this book, Secrets, or the usmleworld qbank. But given the price, I think it's a great investment. Plus, I've heard it's great for Step 3 as well."
4,Makes me happy...,"First heard this band at the 2001 Reggae on the River, a yearly Reggae festival on the Eel river in Mendicino County, Ca. The crowd was very receptive to the feel good message of the band, and I was inspired to pick up the cd.All I can say is that I get happy every time I put it on. The grooves are infectous. Best described as surf reggae with a hint of R&B and a sense of humour, this cd can't be beat at a summer party. My only complaint is that some of the r&b ballads aren't to my taste, but you can't please everyone all of the time. Pick it up and party down."
4,Not just for GWD fans!,"OK -- I admit that I originally only bought this video because I wanted to see Geriant Wyn Davies in something other than Forever Knight.After watching the video, however, I can definitely recommend this to just about anyone. The movie is light-hearted fun. Jean Stapleton is perfect as the mother who doesn't know when to let go.The alternate title of ""Ghost Mom"" would make more sense than the ""Bury Me in Niagara"" title does. Regardless of what it is called, watch the movie and enjoy yourself for 1 hours."
5,You're lucky if you own it!,"I am one of the lucky ones who owns this movie! So I watch it over and over again and have the same great fun. By all means, watch it!"
2,Hagiography as Biography,"I understand that Joni Mitchell is widely recognized as amazing; that's why I was interested in what has made her tick throughout her impressive career as an artist. But the more this author tries to convince me of JM's genius, the less convinced I become. Despite the vaunted research and volume of this text, one comes away with almost nothing in terms of being able to understand Mitchell's true influences and personality, any sense of where the words, music and paintings come from.When every quirk is excused, every decision sanctified and every critic dismissed, it's impossible to get past the endless stream of praise that is already part of the public discourse on Joni. Ironically, it doesn't seem like there's much here, and Karen O'Brien has made Joni Mitchell smaller by coating her whole life with a protective veneer of preordained sainthood."
4,Since Joni won't write her autobiography..,"This is the next best thing. This book illuminates all the myth of Joni Mitchell. Enigmiatic. Complex. Multi-faceted. And forever evolving. I know that she can't hold the guitar due to her polio, but there are tons of men and women who would kill to learn all the JM tricks! I would! She's the reason why I still play music. I don't listen to her much, because if I hear something, then I want to play it all! Especially the ""jazz"" stuff, with the modern stuff a very close second. Just read the book!"
3,a big work but with a lack of objectivity,"I really dig Joni Mitchell stuff and really think she's a complete artist.I read this book and it is really oriented for fans, It could have been more objective.all the development of the author around feminism sucks, and sometimes it gets to what I call ""cheap psychology"" with the will to explain things that can't be explain. The interpretation of the author goes to far. Sure there is a really important research work about JM's life, but it could have focused a little more on music instead of detailing her relationships.However, it is the best I read on Joni so far."
5,Lets You Dream!!!,"For those of you who love France, the food, the culture, the art & architecture, etc., this magazine is definitely for you! Great photos, well-written articles that make you feel like you're there! A pleasure to get every two months. Only complaint: I wish it were Monthly!..."
1,Rip off!,"This thing is made out of flimsy plastic and cheap rope, broke as soon as I sat down! Not as big as advertise!!! A fat 6 year old wouldn't quite fit on this p.o.s."
5,UFO is growing up,"Yes, the best album to date. There's a good amount of maturity in this album, with UFO flexing their musical over this mixological abilities. The jazz is more hefty than the dub on this album, and it plays well. One of the best tracks on the album is ""Flying Saucer"" with a phenomenal performance from jazz vocalist Dee Dee Bridgewater. Way, way cool. But the acid jazz is pretty hefty, too, on a lot of other tracks, and very akin to past efforts from UFO. It's a great bridge album for jazz people wanting to taste acid and acid folks wanting a bit more jazz in their coffee. The tracks stand way more independently than previous releases. The most beautiful aspect of the album is that the band is showing evolution, they're not tapped into formula. They're growing. The cloth of Bon Voyage shows a finer weave than previous albums, with a more focussed approach. Only complaint is the ""Happy Birthday"" track. A very lame close to a great album."
5,One of my favorite albums...,"This upbeat album draws elements of jazz, flamenco, samba, bop, cuban percussion, funk, reggae, dub basslines and more and with vocals in English, French, Portuguese and Japanese combines them into a consumate trip-hop groove. Every track is strong and evokes a strong emotional response. Highlights include the bouncy ""Tres Amigos, my vote for UFO's theme song sung by Dee Dee Bridgewater called ""Flying Saucer"" that I defy anyone person with a beating heart to listen to without wanting to break out into dance right there and then and, my personal favorite, ""Pilgrims"" which is one of the most hauntingly ethereal songs I have ever heard."
3,Good Grief!,"I was very hopeful that finally I would get a feeling of closure for the series with the OVAs. Well, it seems the whole series was a plot by a power hungry villian to map a path way thru dimensions by creating a couple of clones to record the map as they went thru those dimensions! So the ""princess"" isn't the princess after all but a clone and the real princess has been dead all along! That really did it for me. I think you might save some money buy sticking with xxxHoltic as it's much better than this series. One good thing is the price for the whole set isn't bad. Oh, one other thing...This OVA set ends in another cliff-hanger!"
3,bad endings,"Good artwork, and stories not too bad, but the endings really dissapoint. Lots of revelations of purpose and meaning. Cute to see ""Cardcaptor"" Sakura save her teenage self. But lousy to watch Sakura get the daylights beat out of her. No fun at all to see most of the others get crippled."
2,Disappointed in Clamp,"I have watched this series from the beginning...or at least all of the DVDs for the TV series. These stories took a lot of twists and turns and ended up being ridiculous. Maybe it's because I like happy endings. This one was not a pleasant ending and I thought the twist was very unfair to both Sakura and Shaoran. I don't know what to say without giving away the ending, but if I watched this video before I saw any of the other episodes, I would never have continued the series."
2,Disappointed,"Like a lot of anime, this one left a lot of unanswered questions in it's wake. There was also a lack of flow from one episode to the next. It really is a shame because the story line is really good. Too often a lot of good anime loses it's funding and the viewers are left wanting. This is one of those series."
3,WTF!?,"This OVA was clearly made for the manga readers 'cause I had no idea what the F! was going on. There were way to many plots holes, and far to many new characters were thrown into the mix. I'm a big fan of the Tsubasa anime and while I'm not against stories getting all dark and moody, this OVA was to big a change from the series. The animation was of course gorgeous & I'm still looking forward to future adventures no matter how convoluted they may get."
5,A Must See,"I only have a few words for this title: IT IS A MUST SEE!!! If you like Tsubasa Resivor Chronicles, then you will love this double feature. It follows the manga, but it is closely related to the original anime series too. You will love it."
3,"Not Necessary, but can be Nice","This is a great DVD, however it is hard to follow the story until you have read the manga.Five episodes is not enough to cover several mangas'. So it is a bit frustrating to watch because if you haven't read the manga yet you have no idea what is going on. Plus, you only get five episodes out of this DVD, and I'd expect at least 12 episodes, especially because of the cost. They didn't hit all of the cool key points either that are in the manga.So, yes, I love this anime. But I would only buy the first two seasons, then the rest of the manga books from the point it left off."
2,wrong size,I thought I was getting a vent cover for my bathroom vent instead i got something much bigger and it doesnt fit.
2,Does not Help With The Computerized PPST,Everyone here takes the Computerized PPST and this book does not help with that test. The Barrons PPST book was the only one I could find with a practice Computerized PPST.
2,Terrible for the Computer PPST,It has only one little section in the back about the Computer test. But all the information in the section is WRONG. There is no practice computer test that you need because the questions on the compute test are different from the regular test and so is the way you mark your answers.
4,Good but better books out there,"This is a great test prep book because it has alot of practice tests. However, there are other books that prepare you more for strategies to taking the PRAXIS. It depends which type of learner you are. Overall, this is a great test-prep book. If you have the time to take all tests in the book you will ace the PRAXIS"
2,"Inaccuracies, in my opinion.","For this book, I found the mathematics section to be excellent. However, in going over the reading and writing sections, I found that the answers given were very subjective. For example, in the ""Writing, Multiple choice section"", there were many answers I had which were not wrong. Maybe not right, according to their standards, but not wrong. Uses of cliches were given as wrong answers. BUT THESE ARE NOT WRONG. To use a cliche is neither wrong grammatically nor wrong semantically, yet it was listed as wrong because it is a cliche. Second, in one question on p. 56, the choice which explains what a carnivorous plant is, is marked as wrong. BUT IT IS NOT WRONG TO EXPLAIN the meaning of something, it is simply the author's choice to explain the meaning, it is neither wrong grammatically or semantically to do so. Dec. 30, 2012.(c) Laura Beth Hattersley"
4,Great intro to net surfing!,"""Zen and the art of the Internet"" is the first book I have seenfrom Brendon Keyhoe's pen, and it's a winner! Those of us whowatched the computer revolution pass us by, will find lots ofbasic, introductory info on the internet, it's history and howto connect. He gives thoughtful, careful, complete descriptionsof the various internet components, such as TCP/IP, telnet, ftp,and gopher. Looking for a quick, understandable methodof composing your own web page? The appendix, alone, coversweb authoring concepts in just a dozen pages or so; I've seenbooks (such as ""HTML for Dummies"") waste literally hundreds ofpages with useless, technical details the average user couldcare less about. Need an easy to understand, yet thorough introto net surfing? Get ""Zen and the Art of the Internet""!"
3,definitely outdated,"It's not that a bad book, just, outdated, unless you are interested in early, pre-Amazon Internet."
1,Terrible,"I cannot stand the taste of this ""cinnamon"". It doesn't list the kind of cinnamon used on its packaging so I question it's true origins. I like to put cinnamon in my tea every morning but this brand is not usable. There is something with the aftertaste that makes me cringe and there is almost a sickly artificial sweetness to it that is reminiscent of those red heart shaped valentine candies. I won't be purchasing from this vendor ever again."
2,Boring account of an interesting campaing,"I am sure this makes a perfect scientific book on the east Aegean campaign. Having said that, for the normal history buff, this book has very little to offer. I mean here we have a book describing unique fights involving difficult terrain, German Brandenburg coastal rangers (Kustjäger commandos), German parachute troops, troops of the legendary Long Range Desert Group as well as the Special Boat Service...and it is still boring. The maps are poor and the descriptions of battles mainly involve boring lists of names and platoons of the relevant platoons, companies etc. To summarize: great topic, great research, poor maps and above all, very boring presentation. I do understand the disctinction between academic books on historical events and eyewitness accounts and the like...but this is just too boring for the normal reader."
1,shame on Amazon for still listing this!!!!,"If you don't understand why I think it is shameful for Amazon to list this book, please go to Loreena Mckennitt's website and read the UK Privacy page. It will make clear that not only was this book written in a spiteful and untrue way, but the actual AUTHOR of the book has agreed not to publish it again or ever to talk about her relationship with the author. It's a real shame that some people won't let talented musicians have a private life and I'm very disappointed by Amazon for even listing such a horrible book."
4,Garment Bag,Good quality. Beautiful color. However had a side zipper which my husband didn't like as much as a top zipper.
4,Fun and disturbing,"I just got a copy of this over the weekend and getting the phone calls is pretty creepy. I have to say, there is alot of stuff here to fiddle with. Some things aren't quite clear to me yet, but overall, it seems to play well.The pacing is a bit off, but that just may be me because I want to barrel through this. I hear because of the real time thing, it makes more sense."
1,The Fun Is Officially Over,"Originally billed as ""The game that plays you!"" Majestic was an exhilarating online mystery, unlike any other game before it. However, gameplay was all online, and involved searching websites on the servers run by EA. The software in this box is merely the interface for that online play, there is zero off-line content. EA shut down the servers running this game in April 2002. So, now, this is merely a collector's item for the box art, there is nothing that can be done with the software at all.If you are looking for a game to play, do not buy this. There is nothing payable at all in this box. It's not bad, it's simply non-existant."
5,An Urban Safari,"The first couple of chapters of,""Scorpio Men On Prozac"" I found myself resisting the characters, resisting the bleekness of their livesI wanted some prozac! Slowly, slowly, suddenly however I was in their world and sinking deeply into my own humanity. The book is a funny, existential safari into Hollywood lives, but it is also everyman's dance with agony and ecstasy. The novel reveals life's cyclical patterns of chaos and stabilityah there in lies the rub of life and hence the burning modern questionto ""zac"" or not to ""zac""! This novel will help you find your own answer with a little help from the zodiac. You choose."
5,honest but frightening,Robt Baer tells the most scary story about our CIA falling into political disarray.....everyone is blameless;every cares about their own butt not Americas' Robt. Baer is a true patriot who cares about what happens to America. Unfortuneatly the present Admin. is much to interested in not offending any country even if they are a major subversive threat.As a nation we have lost our backbone and we are being controlled by a bunch of Bureauocrats...It is so sad...
3,Audio CD problems,"Warning to CD users: The CD version is formatted in such a way that it is not recognizable by all CD players. The CDs would not play in any of three car systems. The only way to play them was to copy the files to new CDs through my computer. That having been done, I discovered something else: The qualities that make someone a good author of the printed word do not necessarily make that person a good (or even competent) narrator. It is absolutely amazing how Mr. Baer can read to you how incensed he was about the CIA with the emotion of someone reading a grocery list. The listener can only conclude that he is not incensed at all, and that then leads you to doubt his sincerity and credibility. The book has several important messages, but the fact that the author cannot read his own words leads me to concede the possibility that it could have been ghostwritten."
3,it gets confusing -,it is very interesting stuff but does get very confusing for someone who does not know the middle east inside and out. Honestly I couldn't keep track of all the different middle eastern names of people I got them confused.
2,Couldn't Even Finish It,"I am not up on politics, so maybe that is why I had such a hard time with this book. It reads more like a report to headquarters than anything. It skips around a lot, too, which made it difficult for me to follow.The subject matter is so interesting that you'd think you wouldn't be able to put it down, but as it turned out, I had to force myself to continue. About halfway through, I gave up.The author has had an incredible life, and what I did manage to get through really opened my eyes to a lot of things. You might like this book more than I did, especially if you are already familiar with middle eastern politics.I think it could have been an excellent book had the author co-written it with an experienced writer instead of trying to do it himself. To sum up, the subject matter is great, but the way it is written makes what should be a thrilling read, slow and confusing."
2,See no Evil,The arthur was obviously connected to the CIA and had acurate knowledge of events that were well documented. The problem I had with the book was the arthur never seemed to have been directly involved in any of the events himself. He did however have an opinion of the events leading up to the 911 attacks and why the CIA failed to recognize the threats. Overall a good read about true facts of the decline in federal policy that overlooked the worst terroristic attack in US history.
4,"""Rogue Warrior"" AND ""About Face"" CIA Style, less the egos","I gave this book four stars because of the intro by Seymour Hersh, a less than reputable reporter given his motivations in the last couple of years. Skip the intro, Baer doesn't need it because his story is compelling. Baer comes across as slightly arrogant, but that's not a surprising characteristic for someone that goes into the bad parts of the world to recruit agents. His message about what has happened to our human intelligence capability is disturbing, as is the underlying message, that U.S. policy towards terrorism has been lacking since the 1980s. This is an excellent book on what ""boots on the ground"" human intelligence is like."
5,See No Evil,"I have not read much of the book yet but, so far I am intrigued.Service was excellent and product as advertised."
4,Story of greed driven US politics,An eye opener account that provides an insider's view of changing political landscape of CIA and how greed and national security dictated Washington's priorities.
4,Interesting Look into the life of a CIA Case Officer,"This isn't a book I read quickly as thee was a lot of information to process. It wasn't a ""fun"" read either with lots of information being presented; however, some of the stories told are amazing - the author parachuting into Afghanistan with Russian soldiers for one. If you have an interest in the CIA, well worth the time to read through. Also, know that the author feels compelled that the attacks on 9/11 should have been prevented with his case inside the book too."
4,Insightful book on the CIA,"I originally purchased this book because it was cited as the source for the movie Siriana. However, the movie was 100% different than the book and seems unrelated to me. The book details 25 years of work for the CIA and provides good insight to the challenges of gathering intelligence. The changes in the CIA do not seem to be good for America."
2,let down,"I'm surprised at the large number of favorable reviews. I was very excited to read this book from the description but ended up disappointed. It started out great - describing what it was like to join the CIA and the training etc. Then it begins to get dense with names and details and the bigger picture gets obscured.There is a whole lot of complaining in the book and when I read a book like this I must always remember that hindsight is 20/20. It is very easy to criticize decisions in the past when the outcomes have already been determined. Nonetheless, the author does present some valid overarching criticisms of the CIA and I'm sure the CIA would do well to heed them.The author does not give a lot of historical context to his situations and I think that hurts the quality of this work.Unless you are a die-hard CIA enthusiast, you may want to pass on this one. There are other better books that expose the CIA."
2,Rambling,"I was motivated to write this review (my first) because the last chapter was so bad. It didn't flow well itself or with the rest of the book. I thought I may have slept through parts of the book, so I started to re-read it. No, I hadn't slept. I couldn't finish re-reading because, like the first time, I got tired of the rambling and griping. In the final chapter, the author missed the obvious. He was the problem and would have been forced to leave regardless of national and organizational leadership."
4,Improper Identification,"The Amazon site has identified this audio book as unabridged. It is an abridged book. I tried to get Amazon to change their designation. I wrote, I called. It is still identified as unabridged!Buy it if you want an abridged audio version of the book.I guess that the lesson here is ""don't trust what you read on the Amazon site, and don't waste your time trying to get them to correct the error!"""
4,The war against terrorism.,"After 9/11, we all know the CIA did not have the ability to protect America. Baer tells us why. After successive years of bureaucracy, the CIA became just another data collection point. No one recruited agents, and even if there was a threat to America, the boys in Langley didn't care. Most of the later story dwells upon the Clinton years of the CIA when the agency had a chance to support a coup against Saddam but instead did nothing. I think this book undermines Clark's book thesis that Clinton was resolute against terrorism. The CIA became just another bureaucracy.This is a nice interesting read. I highly recommend it as a story of what the CIA should not become. More people like Baer need to employed by the agency in order to protect our country."
5,History is prologue,"Great book that confirms my impression of the culture of working for our government in the pre-9/11 days. Of course, the author is a little too pessimistic, and nostalgic about the good ol' days of the Cold War. But if you want to understand the effects of poor leadership, careerism, and lack of vision on a high-stakes government operation, there are many lessons to be learned in this book. All this in addition to the historical backdrop of the book makes this a worthy read for anybody interested in current events."
4,Confirmation,"The book confirms it is always far better than the movie. It is unfortunate how the CIA was dismantled but from the book it shed light on other problem areas - that needed to be cleaned up. We truly need a forward operating system to combat the USA's problems. Just want to say ""Thank You"" Mr Baer."
4,Realistic and Depressing,"Robert Baer's novel of his experiences in the CIA is fascinating. He provides a gripping account describing the various assignments of his career which ultimately leads to Iraq. The book seems to accurately describe life as a CIA Officer. It describes the many ways the US government and the CIA, in particular, bungles delicate missions. The short-sightedness of the US government, as portrayed, is convincing enough to leave one with a sense of wonder at how we've managed any successes to date. One can only hope the CIA and our government has changed it's ways since the 90's but it's doubtful. Definitely a good read."
4,See No Evil,"See No Evil is a fascinating true view of 20 years of life in the CIA....including the frustration of how ""political correctness"" has changed the role of the CIA and how America is so vulnerable today. A really eye-opening and thought provoking book....I am so glad I read it!"
4,Consistent with what I know (through various sources) about Clinton and Bush administration,"CIA did not permit torture until Bush administration. It is a very surprising fact given the immense media coverage about torture. This is consistent with Baer's detailed portrayal on how DO became increasingly dysfunctional starting in 1980s. It is also consistent with the corruptions in Clinton administration, and the liberalization of financial sector beginning in Reagan administration that essentially corrupted the financial sector."
5,"Read it in Hawaii, wish I could have stayed, book was good too","See No Evil is a very good, very quick read that moves at a thriller pace. I took it on vacation to Hawaii and the book consumed me. It is interesting and scary, and if it's all true, not good."
3,True Lies,"If you're interested in espionage and the Cold War, you'll find this to be an interesting read. A bit slow in parts, but the interesting portions are worth the time."
5,"as usual, Goverment promates those who don't dare to make waves.","I work for the Federal government and I can feel Robert Baer's frustration with management. Management does not listen to the little guy who is out in the feld actually doing the leg work and who has an actual feel for what is really going on. Most managers sit in their Ivory tower and relish in thier ""Superior Self"",I know everything and can kiss off."
4,This Book is Terrifying,"Don't read this book unless you want a realistic, and frightning look at the status of the CIA and the world we live in. I found this book fascinating and amazing."
3,Join the CIA and become a pond?,"Do you want to join the CIA and become a pond? Unlike the 5 star reviewers, his description of the CIA and becoming an agent during the first half of the book was typical. There are plenty of books with similar descriptions. The last half, and particularly, the last 20 pages are worthy of reading his book. However, I disagree with the other reviewers about his views on Islam and Mulisms. This author gave the reader a very brief summary of his career and his commentary during the last 2 years reveal the real source of our problems stem from Washington D.C., not in the Middle East.Finally, this is not recommended for those considering a career as a case officer with the CIA. Wait until Wash D.C. applies rational policies towards Israel and the other Middle East nation-states."
4,Grab this...,"I was in a bind, when a plumber wanted to charge me $900 to retrieve a stuck brass plunger from a tub enclosure. After politely asking him to leave, I did some research for this grabbing tool and found exactly what I was looking for. Although, it turned out not to be strong enough for a small brass plunger, I have found many other uses for it. Who knew that it would take a dastardly plumber, to help me find a tool I've been missing in my arsenal for years."
1,not worth the money,I would not recommend the this toy I bought them then immediatly took them back. THey don't fit like they should and child must stomp really hard to make sound so it could be very annoying and there is no off button. not worth 19.99
4,"Good reading, good work, not what I expected","You would expect that each chapter would be about a different start-up. Instead, the author steps through a functional flow (getting an idea, starting the business, dealing with VC's, etc.) on a chapter by chapter basis, inserting case studies as she goes. It's quite well done, though somewhat superficial. You are likely to learn a little from some chapters, nothing from others...unless you haven't lived in the US or followed the business world at all in the past 10 years. You definitely will be reminded that entrepreneurs are a unique breed with definite challenges ahead of them...and no guarantee of success."
1,Like stale coffee.,"The only thing great about this book is the title of the book and the cover jacket.""Demystifys the venture industry"". I don't think so.""Exploring the entreprenurial spirit."" Somewhat.If you want to understand the venture world don't bother.If you are an entreprenuer and you want to find how tough you are compared to other entreprenuers seeking venture funding read this book.On the other hand why bother when you have Napoleon Hill's classic ""Think and grow rich.""The only life saver for this book is the sample term sheet that appears on the appendix.In hindsight thats the only reason I would buy this book.e-Boys is the best book in this genre."
1,A Meager Attempt,"I hope that the playful advertisements between segments are flags for the reader, some kind of indication that Ryman doesn't take his gimmick too seriously.Concluding that this ""novel"" has any kinship with the likes of Joyce or Barth or Queneau is RIDICULOUS.The work is at best cute. Cute, I mean, in the tradition of iMacs and VW Bugs. There is something of a techno fetish here, that has more to do with surfaces and superficial complexities. A meager attempt."
4,Great book on a fascinating subject,"The vanishing world of tramp freighters is well documented in beautiful photographs and interviews with skippers all around the world. One of the only books on the subject, this large format edition takes you away to the exotic seas which these ships and their hardy crews frequent."
3,American trance just doesn't cut it.,This CD is mediocre. It sits in my pile of trance albums rarely getting played. There's just nothing about it that is very memorable. It's not terrible.. when I do play it I give the whole CD its whirl.. but quickly I toss it aside to play my favorite trance CD's.
3,This CD rocks!,"From the first time I listened to this cd,I was hooked. Since then (about 3 weeks) I've listened to it maybe 50-100 times straight through. I hope that fact alone tells you how good it really is!"
3,Good but Expecting a little more,This cd is very powerful and it is hi-quality trance music. But I was expecting a little more from a name as big as Christopher Lawrence. None of the tracks had words and some did not really match my taste. The best for hardcore trance fans but I like some lyrics/melody in my music.
2,Another bandwagon jumper,"I have no idea why this guy is considered a ""trance messiah"". While the only track on here that he wrote himself is produced very well.....there's just no real artistry involved whatsoever in this cd. It's pretty obvious that he just spent a week working on that song of his, then spent maybe 4 hours picking out what other songs to put on the cd, then spent an hour mixing it all together and just tagged the infamous word ""TRANCE"" onto the album knowing well that it would make it sell better. I just have a hard time enjoying music mixed/made by people who are just jumping the bandwagon and have no real passion for electronic music. Don't think this is a stab im taking at the genre itself. Some trance really moves me......but nothing on this cd does unfortunately.......just another dj except he happens to have a good promotional hookup to get his name out there more than his other dj friends."
3,frenetic trance...,"This is CD is not for me, but I can see how other people like it. Its got tons of energy and never stops banging, but its way too frenetic for me. Most good trance mixes build to a peak and take you on a journey, but this one starts out from the gate a little too hyper and doesn't stop. It would be a good CD for fans of DJ Tiesto or Oakenfold, but if you want a true mixing experience, check out Dave Seaman, Sasha (especially his Ibiza set), and Digweed. Its a good CD for listening to in the car and driving like a maniac, but if you just want to chill and let the music flow through you, check out the above guys...you won't be dissapointed."
5,High Quality Trance,"I don't usually like trance but thought I would try this one out after hearing so many positive reactions to Christopher Lawrence. From first listen to United States of Trance, I was enthralled. This DJs music is not like any of the trance I have heard before. It has more rhythm and more depth. I would definitely recommend this CD to anyone who is interested in hearing a top notch example of quality trance."
1,Carril is Carril but Gardel is not Gardel,"It doesn't take much to realize that the songs listed under Carlos Gardel are not sung by Carlos Gardel. I suspect these are interpretations by Paco Medina, who decades ago recorded a few LPs in homenage of Gardel and embraced his style of singing. It's hard to find Medina's recordings now a days. The record company should specify that the singer is not Gardel. This aside, the selection and recordings are nice to listen."
1,Too small to see,"When I received the elephant I could not find it in the paper. I emailed them and they told me to look real close in the paper, it is so tiny. By the time you pay for shipping it is really too much to pay."
2,Big bald patches in the back,"I mean, this was really inexpensive, so I guess you get what you paid for. The wig is a lot less full than it appears in the picture, and you can see the netting underneath it really easily when viewed from behind. Bought it for a Halloween costume but didn't end up using it."
2,It's going bald,"I took it out of it's plastic bag, put it on and while I was styling it (combing the hair with my fingers) half the wig got stuck in my hands...I am really disappointed, I spectated more from it."
1,"Tangled mess, falls apart","I bought a ton of cheap wigs between $5.00 - $12.00 for a wig party and this was the only one that was unusable. As soon as I took it out of the package, clumps of hair started falling out. When I tried it on, it looked nothing like the picture. It was just a mass of different length, tangled, frizzy hair. No matter how gently I tried to comb it, chunks of hair would fall out. At least I only threw away $6."
1,It's true wig is cheap,"I've ordered many wigs on amazon and this by far has been the worst one.It serves its purpose if you are just looking for cheap halloween type wig, but if you are looking for a sexy classy wig this is not it. I tried to brush mine and fix it since its shipped folded and all messed up and chunks of hair fell out of it."
3,it will work,"The wig is a great length. It is fun.. With that said, it is very shiny and it sheds. If you are looking for fun rather than real ..this is your wig!"
1,Very dissatisfied.,"When I opened the product, it was in a very knotted not to mention tangled-up mess. It barely even resembled hair, and looked absolutely nothing like the product in the picture when I tried it on. I couldn't even get it untangled. And when I gently brought a comb to it, half the hair fell out leaving a mess all over the floor.In short, you could probably find a way better wig at a dollar store during halloween season."
3,Great Color,"The color is vibrant and beautiful, but like most others said, very tangly and tough to comb through. That is to be expected with wigs I suppose, or at least the cheaper quality ones. Works great for my costume but I did not appreciate paying MORE in SHIPPING than the actual wig itself cost."
1,Nothing to brag about,"A wig that was used to do a video and simple enough it served it's purpose. You get what you pay for. It was cheap and that was what I wanted, nothing expenise so as I said you get what you pay for."
3,you get what you pay for,"this wig is fun, it did it's job. i love it, but considering it's just a halloween-type wig, it's not very high quality.the style is pretty cute, but a little thin on the ""hair""."
4,Good wig for the price,"I ordered this wig because I was dressing up as Lady Gaga, and it worked well. It was hard to comb without losing hairs, so I left it a little messy, but it still looked good. I'd recommend it for wearing a couple times, but it probably isn't a long-lasting item."
4,Twister Costume Accent,"I bought this wig to wear with my Twister costume for a Halloween party. Thought the wig shared the same 70's style the costume had. I loved wearing it! For only $10, it's well worth the price. The wig lost quite a bit of hair after one night's wear, but it's comb-able, nice and shiny, and I liked how it looked on me! :) Wigs are fun!"
4,Not-So-Glamourous Wig,"This is a cheap, purple wig, as should be expected. It gets the job done, but it isn't as pretty as it looks in the picture. It's also easily tangled, so be sure to keep neatly packaged between uses."
5,CHEAP!!! CHEAP!!! CHEAP!!!,DON'T PURCHASE THIS WIG. I BROUGHT IT FOR HALLOWEEN AND OF COURSE JUDGING BY THE PRICE I KNEW IT WOULDN'T BE A GOOD QUALITY WIG BUT I NEVER EXPECTED TO GET WHAT I GOT. IT WAS HORRIBLE. THE HAIR FELT LIKE PLASTIC AND IT WAS TACKLED AND I COULDN'T COMB THROUGH THE MOB THAT WAS SUPPOSE TO BE HAIR.
2,For the price...... ok I guess,"I knew I was buying a cheap wig, but I was impressed by the reviews I saw. When the wig arrived, it was slightly below my expectations. The wig was folded in half and even though I carefully removed it from the package, the ends got all knotted and frizzed. And every time I touch the wig, more hair falls out.In retrospect, I should have skipped this purchase."
4,great costume wig,"I bought this wig for a Lady Gaga costume, and plan on wearing it again for some costume parties this month. It looks great, although some of the hairs are starting to come out. This is a great buy if you just need a blonde wig for Halloween or something."
2,Okay for the $$,"I found that if you use a boar bristle brush to brush it out and smoothen it a little bit, that helps from making it shed like crazy. The one thing I didn't like about this wig, was that the bangs are way too long and way too thick. They were way past my eyes and really itchy. I tried cutting them and it came out worse looking so I just threw it away without getting to use it."
1,Horrible Product,"Wow I have seen cheap synthetic wigs, but this one takes the gold by far. When it arrived it was folded in a small package which ensured that the product was incredibly tangled and frizzled by the time i took it out. I cant even use this wig for the event i needed it for since it is in such bad condition upon receiving it. Do not buy this product unless you enjpy wasting 14 dollars to purchase and ship it."
2,Cheap!,"You get what you pay for, but don't buy this if you expect to use it more than once. And then wear it only in a low light situation.It was mangled in the bag, the color was horrible and the hair fell out."
3,"looks good, and great value",kinda stringy but for the price was good. will look at more of this item type to get better for me
3,Halloween Wig,This wig is ok for the money I paid for it. Be prepared though because it does shed alot. It stays in place though and does what it is made for.
3,could be better,"The wig is definitely less full than it looks in the picture, especially thin in the back. I'm going to put it in a ponytail so it'll work out but it seems kind of cheaply made. I'm afraid to comb out the knots that already formed because I don't want more of the hair to fall out. However, I can't really complain too much because I paid less than $10."
3,Wig,"I really love this product, glad I purchased this product, and really quick and prompt shipping. I would tell a friend or family member to buy this product."
1,do not waste your money,yes this wig looks beautiful.but not once you get it home it looks totally fake the bangs arnt like it looks and it gets tangled easily it cost $18 for this wig and a cheap wig cap that looks worth 5 cents if i could i would get my money back and give the wig back
3,Looks nice after you put in work,So when I first took the wig out of the packaging I was disappointed. But then I got to work untangling and curling it one section at a time. The stems are not super strong so be gentle. Be gentle when getting knots out. Hella hair came out by the time I was done but it did not make the wig look bare. Use the lowest setting on your curling iron or straightener so u don't burn the hair. The bangs were the most difficult part for me to get right. One of the other reviewers was right when she said it's hard to ware if you have a lot of hair.
2,Not Kelly Kapowski,"Was bummed this wig was not what I expected. I was looking for Kelly Kapowski hair for my Halloween costume...brown wavy hair and feathered bangs. The wave was there...but the wig was a strawberry color. You can't really tell color via the picture but note it is not ""walnut brown"" and last time I checked Mr. Kapowski was not a red head."
3,not that great,Late shipment. Was not all that impressed with the product. It was hard to manage and more of a hassle than fun.
1,Yuck!,This wig looks awful. Do not order unless you have an amazingly large forhead. Next time I will pay extra and get a better wig.
4,Fun and Easy,This is a fly through crossword puzzle. It is both fun and easy. The print is not tine and not huge. Ideal for light fun.
5,a marvellous work on the Sword and it's impact,"I think I have all of Ewart Oakeshott books, and find them an invaluable source of information on Knights, Weaponry, Armour and how the knight lived, girded himself for battle and their function in the Medieval feudal system. This book is no expect ion, but rather the rule to quality works.It's full of just about everything you would want to know about the swords, their use, and construction. There are hundreds of sketches to help you understand his discussions, lots of black and white plate photos. The book is broken down to groups - Swords 1050-1350, Group 2 1350-1550, then breaks down into Pommel-Forms, Cross-Guards, Grips and Scabbards.A wonderful references for the writer, sword collector and same the passing enthusiast."
5,beautiful!,I purchased this ornament as a gift for a little girl whose mother is getting married. I wanted the daughter to have a special keepsake to commemorate the day. The ornament is well crafted and is beautiful. The arms look fragile so I would explain to small children that it is not a toy.
1,No Quality,"I record readings for a friend. This unit is such poor quality. The machine itself makes so much noise that when you try to play it back, you hear your voice only as a secondary sound. The main sound is just static. It is also packaged in a hard clam-shell package, which is not returnable after opening. So once you ""try"" it out, it's yours no matter what. The recorder is made in China, the cassette tape is made in Mexico, and the adapter is made in Thailand. Just cheap products that don't work. What a waste!"
4,Cassette Voice Recorder,"This casssette recorder does seem to have a fair amount of background static, and yet it is much superior to what I last had. The sound quality, except for that background static, which is fairly easy to ignore, is excellent."
2,"TCM-210DV Speaker has harsh , tinney sound; motor noise recods in the background.","I am surprised that Sony would let their brand name be used on this product. It is either a Chinese counterfeit or Sony has sunk to a new depth to make an extra dollar. In the past I owned two fine small Sony recorders of excellant quality in the $100+ range (tcm-59v and tcm-500dv) but have not been able to find them for sale now. I am tempted to order your tcm-929 Pressman but don't want to invest that much money without some legitimate review of its quality. My wife can not use the new digital recorders for her lessons because of visual impairment. I am not returning the tcm-210dv because she has to use it while her old Superscope c105 professional is being repaired (The Superscope is a great, versitile machine but too heavy and large for her to carry. Was purchased in the 1970's).Thank you, Harlo Hunter"
1,standard tape too big,I was sorry to have to return this. I could not get a book on tape into it. I had another person try as well to make sure I was not missing something.
2,Coulda woulda shoulda,"I bought this thing to replace my dying Aiwa. AFter having it for several months I'm not too crazy about this purchase. It doesn't do a lot of things and it wasn't cheap. Definitely,not getting what I paid for. It doesn't cue, the knobs are cheap and it feels with one push, the box might come a part. The design of this thing is kinda lame. The recording mic rests on one side while the record button you must push with the play button just doesn't make sense. It eats batteries so thank goodness for the dv adapter. The sound is clear enough but not as clear as Aiwa which they don't make anymore. And just notI use it for recording ideas for music. I thought it recorded in stereo, well, that was MY mistake.If you're recording speech and don't give a pig's nose about the 'feel' about the esthetics itself, then this is the device for you. And you'll pay well for it. It's worth $15 and maybe @20 with the adapter,not more."
1,Hiss,"Operating manual is confused/ing. There is a lot of tape hiss or other noise on playback. It was unusable, so I returned it."
1,TCM-210DV,"I was very disappointed with the unit. After having read a positve review on it's sound quality I found the sound to be of very poor quality. I then sent the unit back, which was at least two weeks ago, and so far have not heard a word. Sincerely Norman Bodarky"
5,Excellent cassette recorder with unbeatable features,"This unit is far better than the superficially similar RCA model 3-5366A. This Sony has much more solid construction, plus its ability to record at half-speed doubles the available recording time. It's a top buy, even though it's hard to find."
5,Cassette tape's last stand.,"It is becoming difficult to find anything that works with cassettes anymore so I would have been happy with a bare bones model. But this Sony hand held cassette recorder comes loaded to the gills with features like optional half-speed recording to double recording time and VOR, which extends record time even further."
5,Works Great,Works great. Comes with an AC adapter to plug in. Comes with a cassette tape for recording. Very clear recording. I would recommend buying. Very affordable when I bought it - I don't know how much it cost now though.
4,Good value for the money,"I wanted a cheap, reliable tape recorder I could use to record some basic ideas for songs. The microphone that comes attached picks up a lot and with good clarity. I haven't tried a few of the advanced options yet but its is durable, records tape without almost any hissing from the mic, and is perfect for what I needed it for. Great value if you just need to record some basic sounds."
1,Sony cheated me,"Bought the 210. Arrived and the Sony packaging says 210. tear it open, looked at the back of the recorder, says 200. Sony cheated me by charging me more $ for a higher model and giving me a lower model inside the packaging. Scandalous."
3,Acceptable one side play cassette voice recorder,"I like this Sony product. No any problem for me at all. I bought it for my dad. Actually I supposed to purchase the one which has auto reverse. My dad really like it. It's very hard to find. I spent a lot of time to look for it. Finally I couldn't find it. So, I just decided to get this one."
1,Sony recorder,still the same problem when i sent it back for a replacement . Get a hissing sound when recording and play back. Sounds like your near an ocean . tried different taps . For less hissing noise .
3,Fast Service,I had ordered this product for my boyfriend who is using it to record his thoughts before he puts them down in wriing. He is a screenwriter and iscurrently working on several projects. I was surprised how fast it shippedout.
3,2000 playmate calendar,"Very good dvd many hot celebs Lisa Dergan (the reason I wanted the movie) was amazing, Dahm triplets, jaime Bergman yeah. Great cast and worth it, You wont be disapointed."
5,A definite must-own Playboy merchandise@,"This DVD is packed with special features, and all 12 playmates are very beautiful inside out. The playmates have their stories to tell, it was interesting to know their backgrounds and such. Overall, this DVD rocks....."
4,Defintely worth the $,Wowee - don't hesitate & add this to your collection. HOT shots with Playboy's best. Far above the usual Playboy release.
2,why did they use such cheapo zippers?,"I got this bag with the purchace of the 6 piece tool set. It's really well designed great padding, reinforced stitching. It's perfect for the set it ships with. There are numerous exterior pockets prefect for extra blades and all the perifreals of the hand tools, but mine came broken straight out of the box. The zippers failed immediately opening up behind it. These are the crappiest zippers ever. It's still a usable bag but it would be so much more effective if you could CLOSE it. It's so ironic because the bag is otherwise well thought out, and probably overbuilt. This would be a great product if they could fix this one CRITICAL detail.-JJ"
1,"Gym Bag, Maybe!","Received this bag with my 6 tool kit. No Bueno! Zipper broke immediately, tools do not fit well, Bag is made of tough cordura material, but not very functional for the application. Milwaukee V28 bag! Now that's a bag!"
2,destroyed the wheels,"I use my bag to carry tools between airports to repair aircraft. Though I've had no problems at all with the zippers, both of my wheels have broken off with only about fivetrips on this bag. The wheels are mounted in weak plastic and do not hold up for long."
3,Ellis Island,"I was a bit disappointed. The information was good,however presented in a dry format. If the writer had followed some of the people from arrival to their new residence giving the reader a feel of knowing the person. I personally would have enjoyed the book much more if the presation were different.. If I had wanted a dry documentry I would have taken a class on the subject."
3,Craftsman,"I purchased this book from Amazon after seeing it advertized on John Macarthur's Grace Books werbsite. I was looking for a book on how to lead my family for Christ but instead found a book on being a disciplined Christian. This in itself is a good thing but I felt like the title of this book mislead me. The author discusses several issues such as pride, work, and lust from the Book of Proverbs. I did find some aspects of the book helpful but the author does not address the root issues of sin but rather just tells us how to behave or face the consequences of Hell."
2,I was a little disappointed.,"I was a little disappointed. Don't know if it's a QC problem or if I just got some rejects but out of 6 pots, 1 was out of spec (315k) and 2 were almost out (289k, 205k). 1 was right on the money and the other 2 were within 10%. They are CTL's so I'm a bit confused. Other than that they work fine, they have the nut, washer and cap included (no knob). I will be upgrading the caps."
4,Does the job,"Comes with a capacitor, so that's a bonus. These pots are CTS and have a nice tight feel compared to Alpha pots. Alpha are a little cheaper, have basically the same tolerance, are slightly looser in feel as you turn, and get the job done pretty much the same. What it really boils down to is whether you prefer a slightly tighter feel, or a slightly looser turning knob."
3,won't work on a Fender Bass,"This pot was too short to work for my Fender Jazz Bass. The wood was too thick, so the threading on the pot didn't make it all the way to the outside."
5,beanie55,This item arrived in tact and on time. It was a great gift idea for my man on V-Day. This would be a great Father's Day gift idea.
5,Perfect!,"This is exactly what I was looking for. The shot glasses are VERY small so you don't drink too much while playing, which was nice. It's a fun game to play with friends. The board and glasses are beautifully made and clean up is very easy."
5,Extremely helpful. This easily replaces all those training you pay $1000+,I own a Solar installation company in India. 90% are off-grid with battery backup. I have taken a 2 day solar training + hundreds of dollars on books and CDs. Still I was missing something till I bought this DVD set. Bob explains each component in detail; pretty much everything you need to know. He was even kind enough to answer a few of my questions through personal email. Now I am pretty confident about my business and even I started training my people on Solar PV installation.Thank you Bob.
2,Not the best,I have been installing PV and solar thermal systems for over 10 years and I found Bob's video severely lacking in several critical areas. One is electrical safety regarding the National Electric Code. If you think you can safely build a battery box that has absolutely no acid containment you are wrong. The do-it-yourself mounting systems didn't look very professional or long lasting. I wouldn't use rope as a guy wire.
1,Broken when arrived,"The watch was broken when it arrived. I called the company right away and they sent me an email with a printable shipping label. They returned it for a full refund. Overall, I was happy with the return process, but disapointed that the watch did not work when it arrived."
3,Old school,"Not a bad batch of songs here. Somewhat gets muddled near the middle. But there are a few solid songs on here, especially ""Watch It Burn."" Nice driving bass behind that one. Nothing ground breaking, just some good creative stuff. Recommended if you want to find some obscure rarities you will never hear or find probably in your lifetime."
1,not what i expected,This goblet I recieved as a gift it was awful the paint was chipped in so many places not to mention you cant drink out of it and the freddy kruger glove on the back and where it was sealed had jagged peaces of plastic that wasnt smoothed it was awful not worth the money
4,retold,"Mordenheim is a Ravenloft retelling of the classic Frankenstein. Its not a bad book but it is of course a bit cliche, since it is takes so many elements from such a classic novel. It does do things a bit differently and is well written. It a good read for a fan of the Ravenloft world, and of horror in general. But you shouldn't expect a truly fresh and exciting novel. There are a number of places this novel diverges from its inspiration, which is nice and needed. The end is also more in line with the unique world in which this book is based. Its not a bad book, so long as you have clear and realistic expectation when you start it."
1,Ugh,"I really don't know what the other reviewers are talking about, as I had the distinct feeling I had read this book about a dozen times. Adam is interesting, the two ""heroes"" are not. The good doctor has some interesting points, but rather than expand upon them the author sort of drifts about between the monster and the doctor telling their tale intersprsed with the action. Thus the book starts out in third person, goes to first, then back to third, and then back to first, then back to third. It makes for disjointed reading. The 2 necromancers are boring. This book is not distinctive enough to set it apart from its source material. Mordenhiem is not particularly evil either, he is more indifferent than he is evil. His biggest crime is being self absorbed. Check out the original tale, skip this version."
2,This Barry is BORING!,"Aggressively avoid this CD unless you are a John Barry diehard (or groupie). Barry has written many exciting and beautiful film scores over the past four decades. But the best of Barry's compositions have been recorded and released on CDs many, many times. Few film-score composer hit a home run every time. This CD has a consistent collection of strike outs. Sure there are snatches here and there of Barry at his best, but waiting for them to flash by your ears is not worth it (and you are likely to doze off and miss them entirely!). The art work on the CD booklet features a list of CD credits in a spiral of small print. The spiral design matches the music presented. The credits are hard to read without being put off. The music is hard to listen to without being turned off."
3,Scattering Stars Like Dust,"This cd is not his best. The tracks are interrupted frequently by blank spaces within the song as if the recordings were poorly done at the studio. If you want the real deal, buy GHAZAL - AS NIGHT FALLS ON THE SILK ROAD. Primo!"
3,Lost opportunity,"I love this music, but my ears keep telling me these are unexceptional performances with flat engineering. I have to go with my ears, because I am also familiar with Gunzenhauser's disappointing survey of Beethoven's overtures for Naxos with the same orchestra. So he seems to specialize in lost opportunities. Have to take this kind of music almost over the top to make it hop. Unfortunately, there aren't many collections of Liadov."
5,Classic,This project never gets old. I Haven't had a playable copy in years. So glad I bought a new one.
3,"some good, some bad","this compilation is too long with some stuff that really shouldn't have made the cut. 1 disc of top-notch stuff would've been better than 2 discs with 30% wack filler. there are some truly dope original tracks on here though, so in that regard it's worth the purchase if you're a fan of some of these guys. but at the same time, you're not missing too much if you pass on this one. oh, and most of the beats sound/feel the same--the fashion expo producers seem to only be able to make epic sounding beats which gets boring after while. too bad. maybe it's time for a ""round 2"" to redeem this one?"
2,Not As Advertised,"Make no mistake - this book is about one thing: Dawna Markova. Based on the title and sub-title anyone would think this is a self-help book about reclaiming purpose and passion. Who wouldn't think that by looking at the title? It is nothing of the sort. This book is a memoir - nothing more, nothing less. It is interesting for what it is. Just understand that what it is - is not as advertised."
5,Life Changing,"Profound. That's about it in a nutshell. Friends have picked this book up at my house and then have gone out and bought their own copy. The words just wash over me and are calming to my soul, almost meditative - absolutely not preachy. I read the poem or at least say the words, ""I will not die an unlived life"" everyday."
4,I will not Die an Unlived Life,"As a cancer survivor for the last 13 years, I can relate to her thoughts on living life and not letting anything stop you fromliving a full life."
3,The Past Catches Up With Him,"Joseph Cotten (CITIZEN KANE, SHADOW OF A DOUBT) stars in this nifty little drama about a small-time gambler/thief who tries to escape his shady past by taking up residence in a nondescript small town. Try as he might to start a new life, the man finds he's gambled at least one time too often.Along with Cotten, who gives an admirably cool and calm performance, the cast includes Valli as a disillusioned young woman crippled by a skiing accident; the always enjoyable Spring Byington as a kind-hearted widow; and Paul Stewart (another KANE alumnus) as a crook who loses both his money and his nerve.WALK SOFTLY, STRANGER is an effective mix of romance and suspense. If you're a fan of small-scale 40's/50's B&W dramas, it's definitely worth adding to your collection."
4,a book-long DVD extra,"My impression was that this book was very much like a DVD extra, made into book form, and stretched out to fill 214 pages.It was a fun read for me, since I'm a Kevin Smith fanboy. Tons of behind-the-scenes tidbits, especially about the making of Clerks. It's always interesting to see how someone got their start, and what lessons can be taken from it. There's an interesting irony that, in making a movie about mid-90's slackers, the cast and crew worked insane hours and slept very little for weeks on end.My only criticism was that the author does tend to get a bit fanboy-ish himself from time to time. Which is all well and good, if an author is excited about his material. However, he tends to over-gush when writing about View Askew films and their receptions.That being said, I still enjoyed this book a great deal. It takes you into the world of View Askew, and gives it breadth and depth, which then makes the movies themselves more compelling."
5,susprise of the year,"i was never a fan of azure ray or now its overhead-ive always found them to be too dry and soft for my liking.I picked up a saddle creek sampler and two tracks from 11:11-speak easy and song beneath the song-were on it. instantly i gravitated to them and found out a few days later she would be playing the knitting factoyr in nyc.i went to the show and it was cringe worthy at best-but before the show i bought the cd and had her sign it for me.i was very heistant to listen to the cd after her less than stellar live show.I cant stop listening to it.its soft and rocking and confessional and abstract. Every song stands stong on its own but they flow perfectly together. Xanax and light house are the stand outs for me on this record.For someone who listens to a lot of Sleater-Kinney and M.I.A., i would say that this is the susprise of the year for me. HIGHLY RECCOMENDED.(and its worth listening to for the sake of its 'brights-eyes-girlfriend's-record'"
5,Finished the book -- Really great!,"I finished the book over a week ago. I took my time, but then, toward the end, I couldn't help myself. I just had to reach that climax! (That skeezer, Clay. He really got what he deserved!) Meanwhile, the book was fun to read, and I loved how the plot ended up reaching its conclusion. I felt so satisfied -- so at peace -- when it was all finished."
4,"Not her best, but still pretty engrossing","I bought this book at used book sale for 25 cents...I was attracted because I'd read ""Class Reunion"" and ""After the Reunion"" and ""Mazes and Monsters"" and I enjoyed them all, especially the ""Reunion"" books.This was a much slower go for me, it was not compelling reading...interesting yes...but there were points in the book where it was easy to stop for awhile. All in all I read it in 5 days. Usually if it's good I won't be able to put it down.The characters were interesting...I too pictured myself as Susan and felt her joy and pain. We never see much from Clay's point of view and I think it might have been more compelling reading if we would have.All in all Rona Jaffe does a great job of telling stories that appeal to women, especially me."
1,"maudelin, cliche, depressing","I read this while visiting a sick relative. I was basically housebound and a captive audience. This book was cliche, long-winded, and depressing. The only reason I didn't put it down after the first 50 pages was there was basically nothing else for me to do. So I read on, and on... There are too many characters, too may side stories--all boring, too many plots that go nowhere. The only single character that is fleshed out is Susan, the writer. I imagine Rona Jaffee put something of herself into that portrayal. Other than that the Hollywood producer with an anorexic wife and a lover on the side--it was like a bad Lifetime movie. Yuck! Don't waste your time!!!"
1,If I could give 0 stars I would.,"No one running Mac OS X should buy this product until the bugs are worked out.Some of the more annoying Fireworks MX bugs:Eyedropper - when selecting a color, selects the inverse of that color, so you have to select the color, then select it again to get the correct color.Crop - If you set up your canvas to delete objects when cropping and then crop your document, it won't delete objects.Text - You cannot copy and/or paste text into or out of the programThose are all I can think of right now... but these are not all the bugs, I run into more and more every day.DO NOT BUY THIS PROGRAM. It's not worth it."
4,A very good overview of Islam,"I have read other books in the series and found them all to be very good, overviews of their subjects. Introducing Muhammad, also provides a very good overview of its subject-Muhammad and Islam. It offers the reader a good entry point to further study of Islam. Although I did find the author to be somewhat biased,it gave me a good insight into one of the world's largest religions and a new perspective on history. The illustrations really help to convey the authors points too."
3,Not very interesting,"I found this book to not be written very well. Much of the details I found were irrelevant and not intriguing. I forced myself to finish the book, but it turned me off from the topic of Nostradamus perhaps forever."
2,Why do they do this?,"The first review by Mark is accurate.The only thing that saves this is the Carl Palmer drum solo.I thought this was going to be like Jethro Tull's Nothing is Easy DVD from the Isle of Wight (which is excellent). It's not.When they showed power boats racing to ELP's music I had to laugh. This is so insane it's funny.Very disappointing overall.If they did show you the actual footage from the whole concert this would be AWESOME.I'm sorry to say it isn't.All you get is about 10 or 15 minutes of actual footage.Whoever made this should be ashamed of themselves.I gave it 2 stars because I love Emerson ,Lake and Palmer.Go for'Master's from the Vault's 'instead."
1,Terrible,"I can't say enough bad things about this video. I picked it up in the store and couldn't wait to see it. They keep showing the same clips over and over and over, in slow motion that are not at all what the band is playing. As mentioned in the other review, we watch ridiculous boat races to the music. The only thing that keeps me from getting rid of this DVD is the final performance of Rondo,in sinc and in real time which is is where they get all the slow-motion clips they use in the rest of the DVD."
3,Not necessary if you have the OpenGL Programming Guide,"This book won't tell you much more than the OpenGL Programming Guide Third Edition. I bought this book, but found that I am mostly using the Prog Guide and Ref Guide from Addison Wesley (the official reference). The index is missing quite a few functions making it very hard to find them in the text. There are basic gl calls not even included in the code. And when you are done with the simple examples, there isn't any material on the CD that will stimulate you to explore after Part II. Not even a cool demo to twick and play with. The price is high too."
5,Great beginners book,This book is great for ppl who have little or no 3D experience and who don't know any opengl. It followes a simple writing style and has good sample programs.
4,A correction (maybe),"If I'm not mistaken, you can use matrix multiplication for translation also, it's just that using the addition operation may be faster.Though there may be some things which may or may not be so correct, this is one of the better (if not the best) books on OpenGL for both beginner and intermediate levels. In addition, the by using GLUT, you can compile and run the code on both Windows and Linux OS, as well as leave the gory details of window, timing loop, input device management to GLUT.Personally, if I am forced to choose only one book to learn OpenGL, the this would be the one. Furthermore, it is not a rehash of the first edition, but an much improved version. With the help of this book, I've been able to write a pretty decent graphics engine for a combat flight sim. My only gripe is that conversion of various 3D file formats such as 3DS to OpenGL is not covered, otherwise you would be able to load and view stunning landscapes and scenes."
2,"Useful as an overview, but...","This book is useful as a quick overview of the OpenGL API, but fails to teach the fundementals of graphics programming necessary to apply the API to real-world problems. Also, it appears that Michael Sweet was brought on board to ""write"" the second edition. Where Wright stresses OpenGL's platform independence, Sweet ignores this thread of the book and writes code that is tightly linked with the Windows API.Anyone looking to learn OpenGL should stick to the college texts, such as F.S. Hill's Computer Graphics Using OpenGL. These books are reviewed by CS professors who use the books in their classrooms, and as such only the good ones make it to print."
3,"Good, but with annoying bugs","A good introduction to the subject. Get's some nice demo stuff up and running quickly.However, not all the examples are particularly good or well covered in the text.Some annoying bugs/typos in the code also noticed, with stuff off the CD not running the way it should have.Quite a few basic functions are not referenced in the index. Some function definitions are just plain wrong (worked out through trial and error!).Needs some more 'blue sky' stuff on the CD to show what OpenGl is really capable off, rather than just what's presented in the text.The difference in two author's styles is also a bit grating. I haven't looked in detail at the other OpenGL reference books, but get the feeling you'll probably move onto these once you're finished with this book.Mostly though well worth the effort and money, but needs better editing."
4,Good addition to OpenGL Prog Guide,"Having learned OpenGL about 5 years ago by using the OpenGL Prog Guide (and ref guide) you may be interested to know that this book provides useful explanations of topics that the Prog Guide doesn't explain very well (if you've read it enough, you KNOW which sections I mean...). I found this book a good addition to the prog guide. Personally, I wouldn't start with this book, rather, get it when you need additional information/explanations. However, others may find it fine for a beginners book."
2,Too Many Mistakes,"Although this book gives a pretty thorough tutorial in OpenGL, and readers may learn something from looking at the examples, the author and editor should have worked out a number of things before releasing the book. First of all, after stating that ""Calculating the frames per second... is about as simple as math gets for 3D graphics,"" he defines fps as ""Time in seconds / number of frames,"" which would be seconds per frame, not frames per second. Second of all, when writing a book on graphics, the illustrations used in the book should at least be geometrically correct. Yet the illustrations in this book there are multiple places where an illustration shows lines that should be parallel, but instead are skewed and intersect. The concepts covered throughout the book are useful, but with all the typos and errors, waiting for the next edition may be the best option."
3,Not very satisfactory...,"Using this book I was always expecting to have good experience in learning. Especially whether the essential data tables are listed in a suitable position so that it can be used as a reference.However, this book places function list in many chapters that once I want to look for relevant information I found I rather look for it from the internet. I don't doubt it as a good intorduction, but I won't say this book to be very good, because its codes are not well documented and not continuous as a whole project. Therefore users have to get familiar to many new codes in each chapter, and they are mostly unrelated.Another weakness of this book is the index. I think if I am not too stupid that means this book does not organise its index very well."
4,The Lord Your Shepherd,"""The Lord Your Shepherd"" by Norman Elliott focuses on of course, the 23rd Psalm, one of the most well-known and well-loved verses in all of the Bible.Elliott takes each verse from Psalm 23 and produces a chapter that relates life to the particular verse. The narrative flows freely and may be easily read in 2-3 sittings (around 150 pages total). This book was checked out of a local library.Read, enjoy, and be encouraged and challenged.Recommended."
3,Ok,"I do not mind cheating book, but I think the hero really needs to pay at the end, and this hero didn't."
2,Dont Mess with the original version,DONT ADD ANY SOUNDS THAT DONT BELONG THERE. I hate when other sounds such as the girl screaming and the bell was added. That is not the original version. It is ashamed that the Bruk Out riddim is only availible on this cd with those sounds added. There is more song with the bruk out riddim. Kill dem by harry toddler and a few other song with the bruk out riddim is not availible anywhere. Album editing is a terrible thing. There should be a riddim driven cd availible for every single riddim that exists.
5,Good book,"This indeed one of those ""forgotten"" books. It provides a baluable insight to a good character. Persuades you to think more critically before statting a business or anything similar."
2,Marginally ok,Suspect you can definitely do better than this for Christmas karaoke. Wierd arrangements on some of the tunes.
1,Party Coordinator,"We were extremely disappointed with the Christmas song CD and were surprised that Party Tyme would have put together such offbeat tunes - many of which were not even recognizable without the words on the screen.We would not recommend this CD to anyone who wanted to sing old time, favorite Christmas Carols at a company Christmas Party."
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"This was the worst item I have ever purchased from Amazon. The music doesn't even sound like the songs should, and no one could tell what the songs were. Don't waste your money - this collection is by far the worst karaoke CD out there!"
3,"Lot of information, too confusing for kids!","This is a great book full of pictures and a ton of information. However, there is so much info that it overwhelmed my son. It is layed out with several tidbits of info spread all over the pages. Although interesting, it was too complicated for children. Would recommend this book for kids over 13. Definately worth getting if you want an introduction to using telescopes and space but it should be for the older teens and adults. I do plan on keeping this book as I think it will provide a lot of good information when he is older. Until then it will be on the shelf waiting to be rediscovered!"
3,Low-cost - no frills kettle,"Though this one is on the cheap side, I like it. It reminds me of my grandmother's tea kettle. It is neatly enclosed with a convenient flip up flap - fairly simple design. We switched away from copper-bottom one because of concern over ingesting the mineral. Overall I'm happy with this one - but a couple of concerns: The whisle is a bit inconsistent and low volume. Sometimes I don't hear it right away. Also - when pouring, I can't seem to stop some hot water from spilling out and down the front of the pot (not in my cup or bowl). Again - at the price, I don't care so much about that (gives me a chance to clean my counter with some nice hot water ;) )."
2,Boils without whistle,"I purchased this kettle because it was more expensive than another unit that was reviewed poorly for not whistling when the water came to a boil. However, this unit appears to have the same flaw.The lid/button linkage seems to be poorly designed - the lid never closes completely, therefore steam escapes without blowing thru the whistle hole. I fiddled with pulling the red button up and pressing the lid down, but other than a constant firm pressure holding the lid down, the lids not going to close tight enough to work correctly.Stainless, yes. Tea kettle, sure. Whistle, no way."
4,"A fine, slim unit",Careful not to burn your knuckles when you grab the handle! Perfect for my camping box.
1,arrived with whistling cap broken!,"Very poor quality. Brand new out of the box, the handle is loose on the end that joins by the spout. When I push the red button down, the whistling cap jiggles and may or may not actually open. If it opens, it does not close again properly."
4,Should Upgrade,MS Project has come a long way in the past couple of versions.I feel the addition of the capability to have at least 10 complete baselines saved adds a lot in the managment of larger and long projects.The new version gives you the capability to add a task the the baseline and have the values sum up to all the higher level tasks. This is now an option that you can select.I feel it it is time to give up MS Project 98 and get into the 2000 series.
2,Not much new fuctionality,"MS project2002 is actualy a bugfix version of MS project2000, with some new funtions like converting task-list from Excell. Otherwise it is a bugfix version for using project-Center via Web, e.g. registration of project houres via web. There is some new reports and you can analyse your projectplan with multiple baseline. I would not acall it a new version!!"
5,Long way home.,"This item made its way all the way to the Caribbean (Antigua) in one piece. It came on time, undamaged and works like a charm. Thank you!"
4,"Interesing reading, but not a quick read!!!","Get your mental sledgehammer ready!!! Be prepared to spend some time marshalling your mental resources to take full advantage of this book. The seven principles of full spectrum thinking, although intruiging, will tax your mental energies while you spend time mastering these new skills, these are not light concepts. Mastering the systems matrix, the conceptual template for your problem-solving activities, will prove to be a rugged challenge indeed. This new approach to problem solving emphasises that you must consider what you central purpose is among other things and create a system of support structures around that purpose. Get the headache pills ready. And, by all means accept the challenge!!! Don't be discouraged. Who knows what you may accomplish!!!? Good luck!!!"
2,"OK as an on-off pedal, but DOES NOT have half-pedal capability","This pedal is OK if you just want on-off use (like Yamaha FC4). Appears solid and has a nice heavy feel to it. However, I had to return because it does NOT have half-pedaling capabilities (contrary to what the description says). It does not have the ""stereo"" plug necessary for half-pedaling. I decided to get the Yamaha FC3 instead."
4,Good pedal for price,"I've used this pedal with a Casio PX200 keyboard for about 6 weeks now.Pros:-Sturdy construction (compared with the plastic footswitch type pedals that come with keyboards).-Polarity switch - I was using a Yamaha FC4 with an older keyboard, but the FC4 does not work properly with the Casio keyboards. It's a tip-negative polarity, and the Privia requires a tip-positive polarity. So the piano would operate in reverse (sustain on until the pedal is depressed). Thankfully, the SP-2 has a switch on the bottom that can switch and accomodate any keyboard.-Cord is long enough (6')Con:-Build quality is slightly less than the FC4. The FC4 has a smooth action (made in Japan), but the SP-2 had some problems with the metal spring squeaking. Some lubricant helped to fix most of the squeaking.The SP-2 also comes with a plastic cap if you prefer to cover the metal pedal. Overall, it is a solid product and almost a necessary upgrade for the plastic footswitch pedals."
1,short lived....,"had this pedal about six months, light use... died at a gig, really let me down. mAudio stuff seams to be getting cheaper & cheaper in quality : ("
2,Did not work with Yamaha YPG-625,"I purchased this pedal for a Yamaha YPG-625 digital piano. The pedal looks solid and well-built. However, it did not work correctly with my keyboard. It does have a switch at the bottom, which seemed to have no effect. It would occasionally sustain notes, but most of the time it did nothing. I tried turning the piano on and off, plugging it in and unplugging it, etc., and switching the 1-2 switch on the bottom of the pedal. No luck. I returned it after numerous attempts."
5,Excellent,"Excellent product and works perfectly fine with my Yamaha piano. At first I thought I will buy a new piano with paddle, but this one saved me a lot of money. My daughter is very happy."
5,"Great product, high quality","As everyone else says, a great product with a great feel. It is high quality, I was surprised how good it was for the price. Not much else to say works perfectly."
5,M-Audio Sustain Pedal,Bought this for my Yamaha YPT-220 keyboard.It works great with the keyboard and Sonar X1.Just be sure to plug it in before you turn on the power.
5,Perfect!,I needed a pedal that was more realistic feeling than the plastic one I was previously using. This pedal is sturdy and works well. I never experienced the clicking some other reviews talk about... But it plugged right in to my casio privia keyboard and I was ready to roll.
2,"Great feel, but no sustain - updated","I was impressed when I took it out of the box; but when I tried it with my Yamaha keyboard, it did not sustain notes for longer than a few seconds.Update: I did try using the polarity switch, but was unsuccessful (see comments). I probably did not understand how to use it before I sent it back."
1,Doesn't work with Yamaha keboards,This pedal is incompatible with Yamaha keyboards. (I have a P-60.) I recommend using the FC4 instead.
1,Does NOTwork,I plugged it in and concluded after much fiddling that it does NOT work - at all! I got a defective one and now have to go through the hassle of returning it.
3,Good product for the money,This is a great sustain pedal and is the second one I've purchased. This one is for my 14 yr old grandson. The first one was for me. It's worth the money. We both own stage pianos.
4,Better than other pedals.,"I own several other sustain pedals, and I like the M-Audio SP-2 the best. It's heavy, which keeps it stable on the floor, and rugged. I actually have two of these units."
4,Not at all bad!,"This sustain pedal works very well with my new Yamaha portable keyboard. It is sturdy, durable, and precise. About my only complaint is that its anti-skid base is not quite as anti-skid as advertised, at least in the situations I use the pedal. On carpet rather than on tile, it probably would not-skid without a hitch."
5,Does well what it is meant to do,"I ordered this to replace the cheap sustain pedal on the keyboard I gave my daughter when she went to grad school. This pedal is exactly what I wanted. It is a heavy, sturdy sustain pedal that works perfectly with the grand piano setting on my Yamaha keyboard. All I needed to do was take it out of the packaging and plug it into the back of the keyboard."
5,Excellent!,"Feels almost like a real piano pedal, and stays where you put it, even on a hardwood floor. Much better than the pedal that came with my Cassio. Definitely worth the price."
5,just like a piano pedal,This is a great product. It has the feel of the sustain pedal on a piano. It stays in place on the carpeting of our church because of the backing on the bottom of the pedal. I purchased it based upon other reviews. I was definitely led in the right direction! I would definitely recommend it.
5,Well made sustain pedal,I purchased this sustain pedal for my old Yamaha PSR240 digital piano and they work well together. I'm glad that the connector has not changed over the years. I just plugged it in and started using it right away. The pedal has a quality feel and nice weight to it and won't move around on the floor. Great value!
5,Enjoyed it!^^,"Pretty good product for keyboard and beginners, but can not compare to the real piano pedal as other comments said."
4,Piano Style Sustain Pedal,Purchase this for my grandson and he really enjoy pedal. He was very pleased and excited of how the pedal performed
4,Nice product,"The product is performing as expected. I hope it last for long though because it appears a little light, but so far so good"
4,Great!,"This pedal works great for me, I've never had any problems with it and am very happy I purchased it. I definitely recommend it."
4,Great Price,"Works great, high quality and good price!My only problem is It's a little hard to push down the pedal! I think the spring is a little to strong>"
2,Watch out if you are looking for half-pedaling capability,"Contrary to the product discription, this pedal DOES NOT SUPPORT EXPRESSIVE HALF-PEDALING. It is a solid product otherwise, but if you are buying this for half-pedal support - do not do it! I am returning mine."
3,Does Not Have Half-Pedal Capabilities,"3 stars due to false claims.True Statement: High-quality chrome foot pedalIt is a very nicely built unit. I had one of these already and it works well and has held up great.False Statement: with expressive half-pedal capabilitiesIt did not do half-pedal damper with my Korg M50. After finding that it doesn't do this, I looked through the opening that the pedal sticks through to see that there are soft-membrane switches not a potentiometer like the half-damper pedals have. I ordered a Korg DSH1 pedal and that does do half-damper so I know it wasn't a problem with my keyboard. I'm bummed about this because the DSH1 is overpriced and doesn't have the nice rounded pedal that the M-Audio unit has."
5,Polarity switch - makes this universal pedal a good choice,"The description leaves out an important feature of this pedal--a polarity switch. Some keyboards interpret the signal from the pedal differently, meaning that if you match the wrong pedal with the wrong keyboard, then the sustain is on when the pedal is up.This pedal has a polarity switch, so it can be used for either style keyboard."
5,Great pedal - squeak fixed easily,"This pedal looks, feels, and works just right. It has a switch on the bottom for pedal up/circuit open or pedal up/circuit closed control so it easily is made compatible with any keyboard. Mine started squeaking, as others have complained about in some of the negative reviews. The problem is that the heavy-duty spring presses against metal at both ends. By unscrewing the five screws on the bottom of the pedal, I had no problem applying some high-quality bike chain oil to the bushings that hold the spring in place, which completely took care of the squeak. At first I thought that a rubber or plastic pad at both ends of the spring to prevent the squeak would have improved the design, but considering that rubber or plastic would eventually degrade with the constant rubbing of the spring, I think M Audio made the right choice. The rare application of oil really is not an unexpected or difficult maintenance requirement, and the pedal will last a very long time."
1,defect,"I am on my second M-audio sustain pedal, as the first one failed due to wiring defects. It works decently, however the pedal slides when i'm playing and I find this to be very annoying. No matter the surface i have under it, whether it is a rug or hardwood flooring, the pedal will just slide back until i can no longer reach it. I think the problem may have something to due with the weight distribution since the bottom surface it rubber but i'm not exactly sure. I would not recommend this product due to this problem."
5,Can I say WOW!!!,Item was received super quick...ordered just 3 days ago and opted for standard shipping. Excellent quality and works beautifully. Awesome shopping experience!!
2,bad quality,I was surprised by the numbers of good good reviews after using this sustain pedal. One week later it started to squeak and the pedal is moving from left to right and so on. Like it is one year old! I remember the Yamaha pedal is more expensive but way more robust.I regret this purchase.
3,First One Didn't Work Very Long,"I had to send my first one back. The second one is working fine so far. I've noticed it works better with some DAWs than others, also. If you are having problems with it, it could be you DAW software. It works great with Reaper."
2,"Feels high quality, but is it?","I received this pedal brand new as part of a package deal with an Alesis Photon X25 midi controller. I thought it was an amazing deal to get a pedal like this that felt so sturdy. Unfortunately, within 6 months, the pedal started giving me problems, triggering sporadically and unpredictably. With no noticeable flaws, I opened it up to see what was wrong and discovered the issue. The casing of the pedal had been improperly clamped down onto the wire, splitting the protective plastic coating. I tried unsuccessfully to repair the wire and eventually just gave up on. I know anyone with decent soldering skills could have saved this pedal, but I saved myself the time and effort and bought a cheap $5 ""sewing machine"" pedal from Radio Shack that has worked perfectly for the last few years."
5,Nice Pedal,"I ordered this for my daughters to use with their keyboard as their piano teacher said they were ready for it. I know nothing about pedals, but it seems sturdy (it is quite heavy) and the girls like it. It sits on berber carpet and there have not been any complaints about it sliding around. I just plugged it in and it worked!"
5,good pedal,I bought this pedal for my Casio Privia keyboard and I really like it. It feels like using a real piano sustain pedal and the rubber bottom does not slide. Much nicer than the little square pedal that comes with the keyboard. So much easier to use and works well.
4,"A very solid, truly universal sustain pedal for all electric keyboards","I was skeptical of this product before I bought it - the product information said ""universal,"" but also that it ""works with M-Audio keyboards."" Having a Casio vz-1 Digital Synthesizer, I was worried it wouldn't be compatible. Never fear, it worked great.The pedal isn't as sensitive as I'd like, but it's a minor detail. Just thought I'd make sure I mentioned it.Overall, a very good product."
5,Reasonably priced and works for me!,"So far, this pedal has worked just fine, and the price was right. Those little square pedals are worthless. This has a real piano pedal feel. (Music teacher and private piano instructor for 20+ years.)"
5,Great product!,"Very sensibility level. Perfect Weight. Nice to use. I'm working with it in Pro Tools 8 and, to me, is a great experience (Principally with the Grand Piano instrument). Really a good investment."
5,Very good,"Work like a charm, my daughter love it, now she can play piano much better....I can recommend this product"
1,Durable but Poor Longevity,"We purchased this about a year ago. It's connected to a Yamaha DGX 520 keyboard. The keyboard and pedal get moved about once every two weeks at most.The sustain pedal just stopped working. At first we thought it was the keyboard, but the keyboard checks out fine. Then I read more reviews on Guitar Center about the pedal and discovered it's a known issue.It still looks great and held up well, but what good is it if the components don't work.They need to work on this.So if you want one that will last more than a year look into something else."
4,*DOES NOT WORK FOR ALL KEYBOARDS*,"Pros:-Looks Nice.-Feels Sturdy.-Mimics the exact feel of a real piano pedal.-Smells like licorice when you open it up for the first time I kid you not.-Probably works if you have a newer keyboard unlike mine which is about 10 years old.Cons:-The worst con I could possibly mention to be honest. It didn't work for my keyboard. It just cut the sound out when I plugged it in and didn't work ""with all keyboards"" as it says."
5,Fantastic Product,"Looking for a great pedal for my keyboard I found it, is looks as nice as my keyboard. It has a great little switch at the bottom that reverses the sustain feature.Pros: Great chrome finish, nice and heavy won't move around, and nice little switch.Cons: You can sometimes hear the spring come back up if you aren't genital but not all the time."
4,High quality pedal,"The piano style pedal looks and feels like the real thing. It has weight and does not slip about the floor. The length should not be a problem for most users. I set mine at an angle and it feels fine. I use a Casio keyboard and the default position of the compatibility switch was correct. The plug seems a little bit long and I found it worked best if I did not push it in all the way, otherwise I have only praise for the pedal."
5,Nice Pedal,"I bought this pedal to use with my electric keyboards and I am very pleased with it. It sustains perfectly, and works with both my Yamaha and Korg keyboards. Also, it does not shift around under your feet which was a problem I was having with the small square pedal that came with my Korg keyboard. I will say that the smaller pedals are easier to fit inside of a gig bag than this one, but than I didn't buy it for that purpose. I would recommend having a small one if your packing it around. As for sound I think they are about equal."
2,"Like the other reviewers, pedal moved and squeaked","AS other have stated, the pedal does have a tendency to slide; also, in my case, a support screw that anchors the pedal at the back end (inside the housing) came out - I replaced it but it still sways - it also became quite loud and squeaky after about 8 months of use. I guess you get what you pay for."
4,Great Pedal at a Great price,"I recently bought two of these for our church keyboardists. They have held up very well over the past three months and do exactly what they are supposed to do. The polarity switch on the bottom is a huge plus since we have two different brands of keyboards that require opposite polarity from each other. With this pedal, just flip the switch and you're good to go - no jumping through menus or rewiring pedals.The quality of construction is completely adequate. It is a plastic housing with a metal pedal, but the plastic is the good stuff and it appears as if it will give several years of good service. Can't be beat for the price!"
5,Well Made,"The sustain pedal feels sturdy, and well made. It works well with my casio wk-210.When you press the pedal, it feels just like the real pedal of a piano."
5,great,Easy to set up and effective. Finally I can play my electronic keyboard as I would a real piano. I consider this an essential accessory for an electronic piano. Love it.
4,Good Sustain Pedal,"I like the M-Audio products. I've used this sustain pedal, their foot pedal and controllor pedal. Seems like the sustain pedals go bad for me within a year. But I'm a full time musician and work 360+ gig's a year, so the pedal's get a lot of use. I've bought the extended warranty which is 2 years, so I've never had any problem getting a new one.I think they could use some heavy duty cables, that may help, but as a keyboard player, I think if manufactures would use angle plugs, that would prolong the life of the cable.All in all, it's a good sustain pedal and I like the size, well constructed on the bottom for stability"
5,thank goodness i needed one ASAP,well I've been in search for a sustain pedal that was not so pricy but not cheap .. but this my friends is a well built product for a great price ... the pedal is not flimsy bit its not overly sturdy as well..the base its self is nice and heavy so when using on stage your foot wont be chasing after it... like i said great price and well built!
4,Sustain Pedal,"The only reason I didn't give this a higher rating is because I haven't had a chance to use it a lot, but am very happy with what I know about it so far."
3,No binder or cover,"It's just a plastic-wrapped package of hole-punched paper. This makes it easy for copying, but it would have been nice if it came in a binder or with a CD rom or something. It looks like a good program, and I look forward to using it when needed for people with offending behavior. However, most offenders are involuntary/ court mandated so I haven't gotten to test it out yet."
2,Not what it is advertised to be.,I bought this cd on the basis that it lists Robert Merrill as the main performer. Actually he is featured only one time on the cd and it is in a duet. There are other performers other than those listed as well. So if you are looking for a Robert Merrill cd this is not the one to get. I consider the description of the cd to be misleading.
5,"Hearland Collection, Whole Grain Bread Machine Mixes",Great Service and fantistic product. Each package has its own wonderful taste. I will continue to order and bake this
5,This and the Fender locking tuners turned a mediocre guitar into a reliable one.,"All I have to do is install this on my Strat. Instructions gave me a good idea of what needs to be done, and I have experience with all kinds of stuff since I was involved with all types of Proto-Typing in many different machine shops so it should be a fun project.EDIT: Installed the Fender LSR Roller Nut. I didn't time myself but couldn't have taken more than 1 hour. Playing this guitar is much better now even though the E and e strings are close to the edge of the fretboard. I have less problem placing my fingers cause the strings seem to have a wider spread, I didn't measure this, it's all feel. Absolutely made a positive difference, stays in tune much better than before and the tremolo is adjusted to the floating position."
1,Terrible Mastering,"The MP3 album, unfortunately, is a real botched up job. The audio is poor on some tracks, sounding like it is overly processed through noise reduction.But, the worst thing is that tracks are not properly trimmed. A few seconds of the end of track 7 is at the beginning of track 8, for example. The end of track 9 is at the beginning of track 10, BUT there is a part of it completely missing.I cannot believe that anyone every bothered to listen to this disaster.MP3's are not returnable (kinda obviously), but there is no excuse for this ever to be sold."
5,Peak Condition,Scott Madsen caused quite a sensation when he did the soloflex muscle machine print ads and info commericals in the eighties. This book shows the gorgeous Madsen working out and showing various work out methods. He is truly an awesome looking man. Buy it and you will enjoy it.
2,NOT AS GOOD AS THE ORIGINAL,"I WENT OUT AND BOUGHT ARMY MEN ""TOYS IN SPACE"" BECAUSE I HAVE THOUROUGHLY ENJOYED THE ORIGINAL ARMY MEN. ALSO, NOT TO MENTION I GOT A GREAT DEAL ON THE GAME. HOWEVER, THE PLAYABILITY IN ""TOYS IN SPACE"" LEAVES SOMTHING TO BE DESIRED. NOT ONLY THAT, BUT WHEN I FIRST STARTED PLAYING THE GAME IN ""MEDIUM"" MODE I WAS GETTING ANNIHILATED. SO I THOUGHT, HEY, WHY NOT TRY THE ""EASY"" MODE. NOT A CHANCE! IT TOOK ME AROUND 20 TRIES TO FINALLY CLEAR THE 1ST LEVEL ON EASY.ITS NOT A BAD GAME GRAPHICALLY, AND THE ALL AROUND IDEA OF THE GAME IS DECENT. HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE INTO THIS KIND OF GAME I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE ORIGINAL. D0NT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON TOYS IN SPACE. BUT THEN AGAIN, I SUPPOSE THATS WHY THE GAME WAS ONLY 5.99."
2,The worst Army Men game yet.,"3DO really botched this game. It starts out okay, but as soon as you start playing, you will hate it. While the graphics are good, camera angles are absolutely [weak]. Aiming controls are horrible also, not to mention level design being atrosicous. I got this game as part of ARMY MEN WAR CHEST, and it has to rank with some of the worst games I have ever played. Army Men games have always been fun, but somehow this one is not. However, if you thought the PC version of ARMY MEN II was fun, then you might like this, but the level design is not near as good."
4,Havn't played ............But!,"I've wanted this game, and the other Army Men for some time, but I have to upgrade my system. This may not be printed because I havn't been able to play yet: But imagine when you were, or are young, and played with the real plastic Guy's, and Medical Nurces, and how you felt when you imagined how you were doing as the Sarge? Well now imagine playing in your house again only blowing up the bad guy's with bazookas and tanks. Not only that, you can hide in the cubards, bedroom, bathroom. Blow up the tub and start a flood. It's all up to you. This time with special effects, sound, and winning the War for your country. I'm 47 years old. I can't wait."
2,Pass this by,I returned this shortly after ordering. Save your money for an electric treadmill and pass this by if you can. The amount of work it takes to get this going is absolutely exhausting and it really doesn't flow well. You will be left feeling very frustrated.
4,"Great toothbrush, but can't replace the battery","This is my second Oral-B Sonic Complete. The first one lasted 3 years before it wouldn't keep a charge. It works great for cleaning teeth, but I'm just disappointed the battery can't be replaced."
4,"Works great, smaller head replacements than Sonicare","I had a Sonicare for a couple of years.... and every time I needed to replace the brush head I had guilt about throwing that metal, plastic and magnet mess in the garbage. So when my Sonicare died, I bought this. It works as well, and with the smaller brush heads I have a lot less guilt when it's time to replace them... so that's a definite win.I have recommended it to friends and family when they were considering getting a sonic toothbrush, and will continue to do so."
3,Too rough,"Nice cleaning job on teeth. But, too rough on the gum line. I used this brush for a few days, stopped using it a couple of weeks ago and can still feel a burning in my gums. Never had an issue with sensitive gums before."
1,broke after 2 years,I absolutely loved this toothbrush until it quit working after three years. I told my wife I was heartbroken. Anyone got hundred bucks I can borrow?
1,This item WILL NOT LAST,All I can say this item is a piece of crap! After using it for 8 months it gave up on me ;-(.Some problem with charging and power button. I have to say I`m quite dissapointed aspecially when my previous Oral B toothbrush lasted 5 years.Will not buy this product anymore
4,oral b rechargablr toothbrush,I like the toothbrush and my teeth feel clean. I had another electric toothbrush that also had 30 sec increment but it would turn off after 6 segments to let you know you were done--this toothbrush does not turn off. But I do like the 3 different strengths you can select. The holder is very lightweight and I wish it were a little heavier to make it stable.
4,Braun Oral-B Sonic Complete,"This is my first electric toothbrush and I probably won't go back to regular toothbrushes ever again. My dentist suggested getting an electric toothbrush and my dentist has noticed the difference. My only complaint is that if you take it out of your mouth while it is operating it shoots toothpaste all over the place. You can't stop it without resetting the 2 minute timer, so this is annoying if you need to spit. The travel case is nice and the container itself is handy with spots to put up to four brush heads. I would recommend this item to anyone."
4,Good Electric Toothbrush,"This is the second one I have bought. It works great, has plenty of power and does the job. The first one's battery just lost it's ability to hold a charge after about 3.5 years. I bought the same one again since it really did a good job for my wife and myself."
1,Garbage,"I have had two of these, paid full price too, twice. They both run out of life after about 9 months or so. They die, they wont power up when turned on. THey will run a second and shut off or wont turn on at all. I am really out on this product. Hope this helps you in your quest for a nice machine."
2,Poor Durability,"I've bought two of these toothbrushes and they are terrific at cleaning teeth. However, both toothbrushes stopped working within a year. For those considering this product, see the other reviews which give a low rating for similar reasons. Buyer beware !!"
2,"Good, but dies after 10 months","Everything needs to be said had been said. Good brush, but it completely died on me after 10 months of normal usage.10 months for a electronic is not really an acceptable amount of usage."
1,Poor Reliability,This sonic toothbrush gave us very poor reliability and service life. It barely made it through the warrantly period. We had problems with the on/off switch not working after using it for a couple of months. Barely 2 years and it stopped working. My hygentist also told me my tartar build up has been much worse since I changed to to the sonic.Our much cheaper Oral-B 3D is still going after 5 years of hard use and cleaned my teeth better. No more sonics for us.
4,AHHHHhhh......clean as a whistle,"I don't know if its mental or what, but I seriously feel like my teeth are getting cleaner and cleaner. It cleans the surface of your teeth with no problem and with ease, but its a bit awkward cleaning the insides of your teeth(the part you dont see when you smile)....but you get used to.Overall, i'd recommend and its affordable. You don't need all those other bells and whistles. This is more than enough to get your teeth feeling super clean."
5,review,"This tootbruth is great. Cleans extremely well, and was recommended by my dentist b/c he felt the ""sonic"" would be gentler on my gums."
2,Oral or Braun,"I bought in September 2005 an Oral B S-320 for my wife and it worked fine for a while, but in less than an year the battery was dead, so she can't use it anymore. Her previous Braun thootbrush is still working after 5 years of using. The next thootbrush that I'll buy will be for sure a Braun one."
1,My teeth don't feel clean,"My dentist recommended that I get one of these or a Sonicaire because they do such a better job of cleaning below the gum line than regular toothbrushes. After reading the reviews for this one I was really excited about getting this toothbrush. It took a day or two to get used to the vibration in my mouth but not that long to realize that my mouth didn't feel clean after I brushed with this toothbrush. Yes, I did it exactly the way I was supposed to, and cleaned for the entire 2 minutes, sometimes more but my mouth and teeth did not feel nearly as clean as they did when I used the regular toothbrush. Maybe it's because you don't get much ""lather"" with this toothbrush but I've actually gone back to my regular Reach toothbrush and feel much fresher. I would NOT recommend this brush."
1,Never in stock,"I purchased the toothbrush from an outside seller, they charged my credit card, told me it was out of stock (not back-ordered), and refunded my credit card. Not a terrible experience at all, but a huge waste of time."
3,Cool Unit with Flaws,"Pros:clean Tivoli design, good tuner, nice sound for the size, coolness factor of a separating speaker for true stereo.Cons:short battery life (AA's in series), tips easily, not very durable, especially for a travel unit. I own three and two have lost speakers without much abuse.Suggestion:leave it on your desk if you want it to survive.Obvious design improvements: Li-ion battery, lower center of gravity, durable speakers, attached speaker with ""expanded"" stereo sound."
4,Happy,"I've had one for almost four years; use it daily and it works fine. Seems like the price is higher now, but that could be my memory. We take it on vacation and enjoy it. Too bad I lost the remote!"
3,so-so,"I bought this as a 'gag gift' for someone who's wedding I really don't want to take place, so I was not expecting a whole lot. I loved Scooby-Doo as a kid and didn't care for the introduction of the Scrappy Doo character. That said. The plot is good. I did miss Freddy and Velma though. Daphne suddenly as the 'smart one?' and leader didn't go over very well for me. I enjoyed 'meeting' Scooby and Shaggy's families. What was disappointing was the quality of the production. The sound is terrible and the animation is faded looking, even for the time. I hope this is re-released on DVD and with upgraded sound. The history (both real and character) is interesting to watch. It's worth having, but not in it's present form."
3,Average,"I had never heard of this author before. The basic premise being that our main character Meredith, has retired from the FBI and is now teaching. However, a former lover and friend of hers calls her into a case (into which she reluctantly enters and discovers that the victim is a student of hers).The writing is good. The author gives attention to details but does not go on and on for no reason.The characters and the storyline were interesting and the pacing was good. However, for some reason I figured out who ""done it"" almost immediately. I am not sure if this is because of my superb deduction skills (doubtful) or because the storyline and plot were just not as tight as they may have been.I kind of got the impression this has been done and done and done before.Not a bad read, but it wasn't particularly fun as I knew the ending by page 50."
3,Fine addition to series,This is a well written comprehensive look at the history of one of the oldest serving regiments in the British Army. This book was out of print for 30 years before Osprey issued a special reprint in 2002.
3,"Good, but missing critical elements","This is a decent getting started book, but it doesn't give good coverage of things such as NUnit projects or using app.config files with NUnit.Unfortunately, this book isn't good as a stand-alone. I'll admit that it did help me get started, but it lacks so much that I can't give it more stars. A second volume that covers more advanced topics is suggested, or the next edition can add the missing parts."
2,Very Superficial,"I really wanted to give this book 3 stars; the authors seem like very nice people, and the book is friendly and readable. Unfortunately, the content is very lacking.Their UI testing chapter was limited to a discussion of various tools that allow you to test-run the actual GUI, but was bereft of patterns like MVP/MVC that exist for the purpose of UI testing.IoC was virtually if not literally unmentioned.The mocking chapter was very very light, and mentioned Rhino only in one of those side boxes, not as actual content in the book (!!)This is one of those books that will give beginners a false sense that unit testing is easy, who then wind up making a mess in a real-world project.And as noted by other reviewers, the book was written in insufferably chatty prose, which somehow only added up to 190 pagesI'm just starting the Osherove, and it seems outstanding so far."
5,Bands that really should be remembered more often.,"I accidentally came across this CD when browsing through the 'Sale' section of a music store. I remember the first time I ever heard 'Addict' - 'Monster Side' on the Disturbing Behaviour soundtrack and I was obsessed with it for a long time. Now I listen to the album and regret that the band didn't continue making records. Really too bad. Reminiscent of Silverchair, Bush and even Placebo (I make strange connections), this band still has a very unique style that I have yet to hear repeated by anyone else. Aston's voice is very distinct and just... makes you want to keep listening. Energetic melodies with a subtle dark undertone is what made me love this band. If you're looking for that 'great indie band I haven't yet heard', definitely get it."
4,"New style, still growing, keep watching - good CD!!!!!","Interesting in that you can't tell the song from the intro. Listen to all of it - Nobody Knows, All Change & Caned rock hard while Teenage Angel and Stones tend to ballad. Great lyrics, good syncopasion and vocals. Only 4 stars because their best is yet to come. Get this soon."
5,A Great Cd,I really like this cd. The singer's voice is very fitting with the sound of the music. This band somewhat resembles Bush.
5,Some of the best 'Pac never-before-seen stuff I've ever previewed,"I was lucky enough to get a 10-minutes preview of this rare, never-before-seen footage and man does it blow so many other 'Pac special edition DVD's and etc. out of the water. It's 'Pac raw, uncut, real, man it's great. I could watch it for days, the things this man says are revolutionary, a true poet of his time speakin' his mind on politics, society, religion, culture - you gotta get this, can't wait for the full release. I hope there are many more never-released tapes in the archives somewhere that will continue to showcase how great this man was and could have been if he was still alive. RIP young 'Pac."
3,unacceptable compromise,"I agree with a reviewer in Stereo Review (now Sound and Vision) who stated, several years ago, that the Guess Who ""got a raw dealbecause they were Canadian"". I'm sure many of you agree. Had they been American who knows where they may have gone.Anway, consolidating their music into ""two-fers"" is a disgracfulsales ploy. Albums tend to lose their character in this type of marketing program and this arrangement is no exception. I was fortunate to find a CD of Rockin and it is excellent- far superior quality to Wheatfield/Artificial.May I suggest Burt and the boys insist on individual re-issues.Any word on a reunion?Should Burt, Randy or the others read this, thanks for the music!"
2,strange combinations....,"First of all, I think a lot of the Guess Who's early stuff (eg. Randy Bachman era) is overrated - they were very inconsistent, having some great songs and then some other stuff that seems very dated and misguided now.But as far as these repackages, it's easy to see why they pair up completely unrelated albums - because otherwise they'd never sell the lesser ones. While a lot of people might want ""Wheatfield Soul"", I doubt there's a huge demand for ""Artificial Paradise"". The same can be said for the other duo packages: winners: ""Rockin' and ""So Long Bannatyne""; losers: ""#10"" and ""Flavours"".Basically, Kurt Winter's departure was the end of The Guess Who and the subsequent albums are yawners."
4,Helped me read through it,"The book itself, The Killer Angels, was not a difficult read. In fact, it's a really good book. The cliff notes however, help you to understand some of the millitary talk you may have skipped through. I personally like Barron'S book notes better, but they haven't done a Killer Angels review yet. I suggest this book to anyone who needs to read this book (for summer reading, AP US History)... it helps you to understand and study for a test better."
5,classics remastered,"Rockin was one of the bands best albums and several members refer to it as their favourite. Flavours is probably the direct opposite in terms of material (aside from ""Dancin' Fool"" and maybe ""Hoe Down Time""), but hey, they were in a jazz/experimental mode when they ditched McDougall & Winter (one of my personal favourite lineups). Nice cover too (not!). Anyways, no letdown in the packaging and personally, buddy with the hi-fi better clean his ears out 'cause the highs are crisp and the lows sound like bass to me (also consider tapes are from the '70s and not the new millenium, Lance)."
1,What Are They Thinking,"The record companies keep saying cd sales are way down . well this is prime example of a part of the problem . first you take a great album ""Rockin"" then when its remastered , they compress the audio and distort the recording by digitally mastering it to loud . the recording companies keep saying there is no limit to digital level , REALLY!!! . Please read all reviews before buying newer remastered products .Also remember this cd and hundreds of others have few or no other choicesto purchase them this way .I have the first generation of this cd master And it is flat an full of hiss . that one is worse than this one , this one should have been a lot better .some of the best cd mastering happened between 1993 and 2003 If you are wondering why some remasters of the late 90's are selling at a large price , now you know.do some research look up ""rockin"" Check on mastering dates and reviews.also beware of import bootlegs , they are usually not as good as stated."
3,"Great price, but a little thin","I frequently use this kind of paper for school and scout projects. My last roll ran out, so I got this one. The paper is very thin and translucent. Maybe I should have known this because it's ""sketch"" paper, but I was expecting butcher paper."
1,Item description does not match what you receive,"I was really disappointed in what I received with this product. It stated that this was sketch paper, but what you actually get is tracing paper. Not at all what I wanted for my 2 yo daughter to draw on. Sketch paper is one thing, but I don't define it as tracing paper....not sure what we will do with this roll now..... Not too happy, and don't want to pay to ship it back to Amazon....."
3,Use it as a general Guide,"I purchased an older version of LP to Gua.I used it as a general reference guide, taking into consideration prices changed.However- not only priced changed (dramatically), but also data, places and related info..... that's what I found.As before, I also found many of the data or essays of writers as invalid, out of touch with reality, and somehow to poetic for a ref guide book....Bottom line- OK as a ref book, with a grain of salt (or many grains...)"
2,Underpar,"Well, I have to say from reading that the author has the right ideas about youth violence but I didn't think that the book went in depth about the topic as much as it should have.The main part of why I didn't like this book that much is the foward that was written by Dawn Anna(mother of Columbine victim Lauren Townsend). I thought that the foward that she wrote was very incredulious and, with the fact that she is one of the people that are suing the parents of Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, somewhat two-faced.I thought that this was a very underpar book and I would not recomment it."
5,A MUST READ FOR PARENTS,"I have had the pleasure of meeting and talking with Dr. Shaw about his research for Jack & Jill, Why They Kill and I can tell you, he is a very honest and genuine man. When I first saw the book I wasn't interested at all in reading about ""kids killing kids"", but I did read it, and the more I did, the more I realized that the information provided for parents was unequalled!! Now, I'm a great MOM! I've raised 5, yes FIVE, children and they are all great people!! However, the insight that Dr. Shaw shares is so valuable I would use it all if I could start the children raising process all over again. But actually, I can! I intend to use his suggestions with my grandkids as soon as they are old enough to talk!!!"
5,If you have a child in school -- read this book!,"In elementary school I remember reading, ""See Dick run. See Jane run,"" now our children are running for a different reason. They are no longer running to play with Spot--they are running for their lives. The media exploits these events as a means of bolstering their ratings, but no one has offered any constructive answers or alternatives, until now. Jack and Jill Why They Kill is not only a profoundly revealing book about why children murder, but it is also a guide. Mr. Shaw knows his stuff and writes about it with an even hand along with some great advice for all parents."
5,Fascinating!,"I found this book to be fascinating. So educational! One can find many useful hints on child rearing and how to deal with difficult children. Some really good examples of extremely disturbed children. Excellent resource for parents, teachers and people who deal with children."
2,Great animation but borderline disgusting,"Sometimes I prefer to watch hentai over normal porn. At least in hentai you've got a decent story, music and in some cases, plot twists. Plus I never feel guilty about watching hentai ... unlike real porn, where the chick you're watching is someone's daughter or mother.I only own maybe 5 or 6 hentai DVDs, but I've got another dozen on CD. The most brutal one by far is ""Princess 69"" ... probably the best looking hentai (animation quality), but too much rape and torture. It borders on disgusting."
1,Sick Stuff...,"I bought this based on the title alone. That was a mistake.I like hentai, but this is just plain wrong--rape, disgusting things with all kinds of bodily fluids...after ten minutes I was so disgusted I took the DVD out of the player and broke it in half."
1,sexist voyeurism,"I found this anime depicts violent sex perpetrated on young girls and was only able to fast forward after the first 10 minutes. As I skipped through it became only more so. However I was unable to finish. I heard it has a happy ending but that seems like it would be just an artistic rationalization. I would rather have my money back and I think my exploration of Hentai is at an end.However if any one is interested in seeing a beautiful and extremely healthy depiction of Japanese School girl life and how it relates to changing mores ( or recapturing dissappearing values ) I strongly recommend Ghibli Studios ""Only Yesterday "". It makes this kind of hateful work diminish in our minds and exemplifies the potential in relationships with each other and the world we live in, which we would benefit from if we aspired to. gb"
1,Animated Kiddie Porn,"I love anime. I even enjoy anime with an adult theme. However this so-called Hentai is too much. Within five minutes of viewing this DVD I was sick to my stomach. I was so disgusted I even destroyed the DVD. This is animated child pornography. Although no actual children were used in its creation, the characters it depicts are obviously underage. I can't understand how anyone could possibly enjoy this DVD."
1,Really?,why the hell is a dvd almost 60 dollers! come on that is just lame. i love static x but i wouldnt pay 60 dollers just for a dvd come on korn's dvd Deuce which is just like this is only like 20 bucks...
2,A very basic point of view,I expected much more of it. Very basic in it's assesments and definition. I cannot get a real signification of EVA until chapter 6. Good for earliers beginners not awaiting for much academic support
4,Disgaea - the complete series,"I don't do games and I'm not familiar with the entertainment, but from somewhere, an advertisement for this series appealed to me. That in itself is unusual, because sadly, anime commercials nearly always fail to sell their product. This one looked a little quirkey, a little rude, and a bit on the fast-paced side, so I took a chance on it. I am glad I did. Disgaea is a fun series, full of demons who aren't quite as bad as they might be, angels and heros who aren't as good as they should be, and worlds we all can relate to. The story is nothing new, but the presentation is well done and the tale is a good one. If you like sarcastic comedy with anti-heros and anti-villians mixing it up for the sake of their own views and goals, Disgaea will entertain you."
5,Good book,"Well, i've never actually read this book, but i'm very serious about this, my cousin wrote this and i haven't seen him in a long time, but i know he wrote this book and i really want to read this book, but it is a good book my aunt says."
5,"Reginald Hill, The Master","Hill is one of the top mystery writers. The world he has created in the Dalziel and Pascoe series is as real as Nero Wolfe's. The interplay between liberal, educated, and sexy Pascoe and gross, vulgar, and brilliant Dalziel is well observed and outrageously funny. Hill has a sly wit, often leading to laugh-out-loud outbursts that can be embarrassing in public places. Read the whole series, spend time with his characters."
4,Catherine does it again!,"Catherine Anderson is one of those writers who can take you out of the stress and worries of everyday life and transport you into another place and time. Indigo Blue is the 3rd book in her reissued ""Comanche"" series, so I highly recommend reading this series in order as opposed to some you don't have to. I loved INDIGO MOON, but missed the presence of the characters from the second book in the series, even though their absence was explained."
2,I had to give this book only a 2.5 star,"Everyone has told what the story is about so I won't go into that. I gave this book only a 2.5 star because I didn't like Indigo throughout over three quarters of the book. I thought she was a very self centered and spoiled little girl and emotionally immature. She wanted everything for her and in her own way with no giving at all on her part... until just the last few pages of the book (when she 'even' realized how selfish she was) and it was a long book. I really liked Jake, he was the giving and understanding one (without him, this book would have gone in the crapper) he kept putting up with Indigo's whinny crap (he had the patience of Job) where I just wanted to smack her and tell her to grow up!! I like my heroine's much stronger emotionally than she was!!!!!!! I would like Indigo to have been more understanding of Jake's needs, instead of only her needs."
4,Beautiful!,"My girlfriend had this bible once. We loved the glossy pages which weren't the usual flimsy kind used for most bibles, so highlighter-markings won't seep through. It has a very readable, easy-to-the-eyes font color which wouldn't give a strain even if you were to spend long hours poring over it. Also, the articles in it are beautifully written in Swindoll-style humor and wit. The extra info given with each book in the bible is also useful and relevant for today's reader. Almost made it to 5 stars for us---pity it only comes in NIV (I think). Would have been extra good if it came in NAS."
5,perfect,allmost looked brand new. good study bible. i already have one bought this for my wife so we can study together
2,What is with the fake laughing?,"I really wanted to buy a download of ""I Could Be Wrong"", but the fake laughing after every line ruins it."
1,Not up to par,I have all Tim Wilson's CDs and may I say this one is the only one that has ever been a disappointment.
5,The Best Tim Wilson Yet,"After finally listening to the entire CD, I must say that Tim Wilson is at the top of his game and this CD has to be the funniest one he's ever released. After hearing the title song ""But I Could Be Wrong"" on the Bob and Tom Show, I've been eagerly awaiting the release of this album. Naturally, when I received it, the first song that I listened to was the Uncensored Version of ""But I Could Be Wrong"" but have since listened to the entire CD and it's awesome. I own several of Tim's CD's and have to say that hands down this CD is his best yet. There's also several hillarious comedy bits in the CD such as ""Southern Accents"", ""Bed Pan Man"", ""Way Out in the Country"", and ""Jane Ketchup Stain"".And if you think this CD is funny, you have to go and see his live show, the way he intereacts with the audience is hillarious, I've been and the show is just awesome. So if you love comedy, if you love Tim Wilson, hurry up and buy this CD."
4,But I could Be Wrong about alot of things!!!,Tim Wilson is a very funny man and most of this cd is good. I loved the title song. If you haveany of his other works you will like this one too!
5,One More Time...Tim takes you for a ride...,Tim is a funny comedian and you will like this CD...he is not only afunny guy but he has his own music to go with it. His music is betterthan Larry the Cable Guy....trust me on that one.
2,Not Tim's best work,"I could be wrong is a funny tune, but the rest of the songs aren't. A lot of his stand-up is in between songs, and let's just say he's a much better songwriter than he is a comedian."
2,Very Disappointing,"I have enjoyed Dr. Helmstetter's various books over the years, and I expected that this book would be every bit as good. I was very disappointed that there was so much verbiage dedicated to a multi-level marketing skin care company. I just couldn't get past the thought that every chapter seemed to be a commercial for this company, and that every Arbonne sales associate would be using it as a tool to recruit to their ""downline.""If you have not read other books by Dr. Helmstetter, this may be a good read, but I sadly found it to be redundant and a bit stale."
2,Just a recruitment for Arbonne.,"This book is basically an advertisement for recruitment into Arbonne cosmetics. The underlying message is very good but you have to wade around the book to find it. I have read ""What To Say When You Talk To Yourself"" by the same author and it is very good. No advertisements. Just a good book. I was expecting the same with this one. I will not be recommending this to anyone."
5,This book changed my family and my life,"I saw Dr. Helmstetter speak at one of my recent business opportunity meetings and I was so impressed with what he had to say that I decided to get his book ""The Gift"" and read it for myself.What that choice, to read ""The Gift,"" and put the ideas into practice that he writes about, has done for me, and my family, I can't begin to say. I would recommend this book for anyone and everyone who just wants to do something better."
5,Great!,This book describes the opportunities we receive to change our lives...the outcome is in our decision. This book really dives into what we all want: to live out our dreams.
5,bagels,really wish the seller had responded to my question (is this the right stuff for bagels) but it didn't matter since it is
4,Barley Malt Syrup?,"I bought this product for my father because he is enthusiastic about making bread. when it arrived I looked at the bottle and it said ""Barley Malt Extract"" 22 onces, not the Barley Malt Syrup I purchased that was 16 onces. I was very confused, I went onto the Barry Farms website and found this article under sweeteners.well we used it as directed on their website and the bread turned out GREAT. it has a more complex flavor to it and my dad was totally excited about my gift."
3,Unfamiliar,Hadn't previously tasted product so purchased to follow recipe. Too much $ for taste similar to molasses. Wouldn't purchase again.
4,Pretty handy,"I grab this tool to do all sorts of odd stuff in the kitchen, from scraping food out of cans and jars to putting icing on cakes. it's not the easiest to grip, but it's a good addition to my gadget drawer."
1,Extraordirary Popular Delusions - Mackay,"I was disappointed in this purchase. I have a copy of the COMPLETE edition of this book and that is what I wanted, but what you sent was an abridged edition and I found it to be a disappointment. I intended to give it as a gift. Sorry. Robert I. Biederwolf"
2,This is a very condensed version of the original,"Note that this book, ""Extraordinary Popular Delusions"" is a VERY condensed version of the original. This edition contains only 112 pages, the first three chapters, mainly dealing with economics while the original contains 768 pages. If you want only the material dealing with financial bubbles, then you can buy this edition, however you if you are interested in the broader phenomenon of the madness of crowds, then you'd do well to buy the original version of this book, which you can find under its full title, ""Extraordinary Popular Delusions & the Madness of Crowds""."
1,I wish I had read the reviews,"This is one of the best books I own, so I wanted to give it as a gift. I did not need to read the reviews, but I wish I had. This is a short version of the original, containing only 3 examples out of dozens. It does not even contain the section on the Crusades, which I consider a classic. I returned the book as ""defective"" because somewhere in the sales page, this abridgement should have been noted. DO NOT BUY this addition because you will be missing many of the best parts of a classic"
4,Everything old is new again,"One of the charms of Dover books is that a great many of the titles (like this one) were originally published 100+ years ago, and while they aren't aimed at a modern audience, many of their topics strike a resonent chord in the 21st century reader. I found some of the sections a bit wordy for my interest in the book (as an economics professor, the historical background was very useful), but then I wouldn't be expected to know many of the names the author took for granted in 1841. Still, the description of Tulipmania and the ingenuity of scammers is timeless."
1,Abridged Public Domain Disappointment,"This was the only book I ever felt so ripped-off by that I returned it immediately to Amazon. I had a few experiences of total disappointment, but this book seemed to be nothing more than a copy and paste of 100 year old public domain material presented as a a relevant work. There is no original material worth mentioning or discussion of the contents lifted. Misrepresented in it's description ( there was but one rave review out of one review total at the time I purchased it) as others here have noted, this copy is not complete. I give it a zero. I'd recommend previewing this book/edition before you buy."
4,An inspirational account of a man's pursuit of his dream.,Captured By History is a riveting account of a writer living out his dream. The story is delivered in an easy to read and compelling fashion. I loved it
4,A great read by one of our best historians.,"Toland was like Ambrose in an earlier stage. He gets the facts by visiting the places and seeing the people who participated in history's greatest events. I love his books, and his concern over tham, and how history speaks to future generations. I have read a number of his books, and this was the cap in his career.I like all his stories about his encounters with famous people. I think he tends to embellish those who are in reality quite bad as in Skorenzy's case. However, he tells history as it is presented to him. I was also amazed that Toland was a Communist during his earlier life.This is a good read about a famous historian. I enjoyed it for his views on history."
5,hp laser jet 1200,"I was pleased with the products and the supplier. All first class. I highly recommend them to all!!ThanksBarry EisenMiami, Florida"
2,LaserJet 1200 - Poor Condition,This product is missing the clear paper input. It also has a broken right side and the front toner cover has a broken arm. The printer was also very dirty.
5,Great Replacement!!!,"I am very happy with the HP LaserJet 1200 printers I ordered from GT Printers. We had great success with the printers in the past and since new stock is gone, I was hoping to find good used or refurbished ones, AND I DID!!! The transaction process was great and I am very happy with the printers. They were just as described and worked flawlessly. The pic did show a paper tray but it was not included (didn't say it was in the description either) but my old one fit just fine. All in all, I hope these printers are still available when time comes to replace them again (the original ones lasted 12 years!!!)"
5,Excellent Value,"I use this printer for a legal practice and the printer gets steady use every day (average of 1,000 sheets per month). The printer has never broken, needed repair, or had any problem whatsoever for 5 years. The first page out speed is moderate - about 20 seconds and print speed is moderate at 15 ppm. Print quality is very consistent and jamming or crumpling is not an issue. One of the best values around."
1,no good,Bought this and first battery install it did not turn on. If you buy it it will probably be a hit and miss
5,Anecdotes and advice,"Mancuso tells great anecdotes about working with his late, great dealer father, Jim Mancuso. He also tells of finding his own place in the family business, and overcoming the trials and tribulations of being the boss' son. He offers practical advice on how to handle what can be a tough situation for the unprepared."
4,Keeping It Real,"""Assuming the Position"" is an authentic view from the trenches. It offers real-world insights on operating and maintaining a family business, from the experienced perspective of a third-generation auto dealer with more than 20 years' experience in vehicle retailing.Those who wish to emulate the success of the Mancuso dealerships would do well to familiarize themselves with this book. To do so would be time and money well-spent."
5,Awesome,"The title says it all, this product will guide you through numerous types and sets of exercises. I love it."
5,Life Is Simple cap,"I have rather large head and this great cap fits me juuust right! Usually I got only headache while wearing similar caps as the dash pushing onto the temples too hard, but this one is very comfortable plus the quality is good too."
1,Not Really Fashion Forward,Touts itself as a history of fashion. It's really a collection of old black and white silent films and clips of fur-coat fashion shows and how to make eyeglasses. There is not much fashion history on this home-made DVD. I am very disappointed as it sounded like it had so much potential. The title of the DVD is not even what was advertised. The students were disappointed and bored.
1,A RIP OFF,"Don't buy it--WAAAY OVERPRICED!! The buttons are cheap, and the voice is not clear. There is no French dictionary, contrary to the advertisement. I wasted my money, and I can't send it back. By the way, G. Hallaq, who writes a good review of this computer, is the guy selling them!!! Cheat!!!"
1,ectaco is bad in general,don't know about this version but I got the english-french one and yes I agreed with other reviewers that buttons are cheap...voice is not clear and not durable. I ended up having to buy a new one from another company later on because it's just horrible. now I am taking up a new language and I am surprised I have not found a good arabic - english dictionary out there.
3,inaccurate versus the docs readings,I have had it for about two weeks now. The readings have been all over the place. I bought this one because of the reviews stating their accuracy with the docs. I went to the docs today and read mine at home with this unit and it read 134/65 and at the docs it read 130/94 by his assistant and the next reading by the doc 10 minutes later was 160/90!!! I haven't had a reading over 72 on the second number at all and was very depressed to see these numbers at docs office. He even showed his equipment was verified on 9/10 and the sticker was on there. I could understand a small difference but not 25-30 points in an hour. I am calling Life Source tomorrow and am probably going to return this unit unless they can explain the big differences. Wanted to like this unit but not happening so far.
4,Happy Customer!,"Exactly what we were expecting, no surprises. The cuff was large as advertised, seems to be accurate. Very fast delievery!"
4,An Excellent Book,"An excellent reference, however, the pictures are black and white, and rather small, though there are plenty of them. Also the print is rather small, which my father found impossible to read."
4,"plese, can you say me what's the web address of brassey's?",my address : bukedi102@hotmail.com I need more info on the book before ordering.Thanks.
5,THE BEST SPEED-WOOD EVER!,"Although their CDs are awesome they're even better live. Not only are the HALARIOUS their music and sound are origional but great. Keep up the good work guys! Next time I see you guys live I'm buying two more CDs, and get that new one out soon! SLINKY!"
2,not that much fun,I have played better games but if your just starting out this might be the game for you I won't buy it again
3,Gets Better Every Time,"At first, I thought it was kinda whack. Then, the more I listened to it, the more I liked it. Although it only has about 6 different beats, the tracks really came together and went with the riddim mon. If you're looking for a cd that has a whole bunch of tight beats, don't get this one. But if you want something to jam to, then get it. Peace."
5,A Must Get for College Parties,You want this phat CD.! It is full of energy pumping beats that keep the party thumpin all night long... Buy THis CD and You will not be disapointed
3,If you don't mind the inaccuracies....,"...it's an interesting read. Good story line, good dialog, vivid place descriptions, and some humorous moments.However, there are several technical problems, such as the behavior of tropical storms, the direction of flow in the Gulf Stream, plot inconsistencies, etc.If you're not too analytical, you'll enjoy it. I'll probably read at least one more of his books."
3,"Good writer, good story, but an ultra-right-wing author","The good news is that the author has real storytelling talent, and can turn a really good phrase. The bad news--if you're a decent human being--is that every other page will likely make you want to kick him. He would probably get thrown out of the Tea Party for being too conservative. Racism, white supremacy, and blind American chauvinism come through very frequently, and you can tell it's from the author himself, not from his characters. If I had spent money on this book (I got it free), I would have felt guilty about supporting the author financially. He could also use a good fact-checker, as his knowledge of just about everything is quite faulty. This isn't a sophisticated guy, or a nice guy, but if you're willing to overlook all that, it's a fun, fast-moving story."
1,Give this book a pass,"Well, not if you are into unbelievable story lines, yankee paranoia about communists, love guns and weapons of all sorts, simply live for chase scenes and big boats / cars / trucks / planes / (...); simply adore gratuitous violence, don't squirm about racism and stereotyping and believe everything is just w-o-n-d-e-r-f-u-l in the Good Ole USA. If you're that person though you'll probably eat this one right up."
5,Very nice laddle,"Expensive, but very nicely finished. The lip on the laddle bowl indeed helps preventing drips. Recommended for serving soups from a tureen."
1,MADE IN CHINA !!!!!,"There was NO indication on the listing for this item that it was made in China.Like another reviewer, I was deceived by the language of the listing and expected it to be made in Germany.I would NEVER have ordered such as expensive item from China."
3,Made in China,"With a name like Rosle, the price, and because it was ""designed and engineered in Germany,"" I guess I sort of assumed this was not made in China. It was. Going to keep it as I don't expect to use it often, only with my soup tureen, but thought others should know."
3,A Pooch Bag That Pretty Much Works,"The bag worked really well as far as the dog was concerned. I have an energetic German Shorthaired Pointer, and we take her backpacking, sometimes in the snow but usually in the summer and up high. Her coat's not built for warmth, and typically she has spent the night in the tent with us, and it's a tad crowded, and hard on the sleeping bags and tent floor. This year, however, I decided to get her, her own sleeping arrangement.She spend 4 happy nights in or on the bag, so I'd rate it a success. The rubber pad is easily removed. The bag, itself is a bit bulky, but demonstrably manageable as doggy backpacking equipment. If it were more compressible, I'd give it one more star, and if she could comfortably carry it, two."
5,Beautiful Music --Michael Maguire is Great,"Ever since I saw the 10th Anniversary Concert of Les Miz, I have been looking for Michael Maguire music. This is a combination of songs that he sings and music from Broadway Musicals by the Orchestra. I like both types of music on this CD. It almost seemed a miracle to find a CD with Michael Maguire on it. He has a beautiful voice and is an excellent actor. He won a Tony in the original Broadway edition of Les Miz. I wish he would make more CDs because I really enjoy each of the songs he sings. If you like Broadway music, buy this, and you will be happy."
5,This May Sound Crazy,"But I waited 30 years for this soundtrack to come out. Great music from a great tv show, and I liked most of the cues. Sounded much better than I remembered from the show because of more advanced technology in recording. The one thing I wish they had included in this is the suspenseful chords they used in key scenes of some episodes, with the violins playing a sustained chord, then playing it twice, then three, then four times. Doesn't sound like much, and probably doesn't look like much on the score, but it sounded great, and grabbed your attention. Scenes it was used in for example, in the pilot episode when Brian Keith's character first visits Kimble in his hotel room. Another in part two of NEVER WAVE GOOD-BYE when Gerard is questioning owners of sailboat makers. Anyway, that's my only gripe with this recording. Seemed like such an important cue because it was used in some of the show's most suspenseful moments. But no complaints about what they did use."
5,AWESOME SERVICE,Thank you sooo much for how quickly and professionally my item was shipped... I was able to wrap it and put it under the tree from SANTA... my brother almost cried... We JAMMED THIN LIZZY FOR CHRISTMAS!!!Thank you again 5 Stars...
1,Why Write It?,"A very unpleasant book, the author clearly holds these relics (and the saints) of which she writes in utter contempt. Bad Paul Theroux, at best."
3,Morbidly Fascinating,"Though I'm not a Roman Catholic, neither is the author of this book (she's a Jew) and I found it fascinating to read. Her descriptions of the lives of these ""saints"" and how their remains are displayed for adoration are vivid and remarkable. The one thing I wish this book had was a collection of photos. If photos of the dead are in bad taste, at least some pictures of the chapels and scenes mentioned would have been nice. Great book."
1,Review of Magnificent Corpses,"Anneli Rufus is efficient in writing, but her treatment of relicsin Magnificent Corpses is very poor. The discussions are veryshallow and failed to live by its title. I have not seen in theselected bibliography the primary sources that could make thetopics more interesting."
1,"Attempts to Be Clever, Mostly Boring","The author has obviously expended quite a bit of time and effort to hold an audience with this piece, but it appears to have been somewhat in vain. What is intended to be insightful and witty, comes across as trite and silly for most of the book. The author has clearly done the requisite travel for the topic, but seems to lack the ability to properly convey her experiences in a manner which holds the reader's interest and attention for any long period of time. The author's choppy narration and failure to vividly portray her experiences in a compelling manner, leaves the reader quite bored after awhile. The constant references to inane details grows stale quickly. An OK college-level work, maybe. A solid, well written professional work? Not in my opinion. Strictly amateur night here."
1,Contempt prior to understanding....,"More research was needed for this book. Virtually everything in it showed contempt for Catholics. We do not get our faith from the imperfect people that constitute the Church (past or present), but from the Church herself. Religious faith arises from the heart as well as the intellect. This book lacked both."
3,"No bpa, but the nipple gets stuck","Love that it is not plastic and dont have to worry about the truth about BPA. But I dont like that the nipple get stuck. I have to pull the bottle out to let the air in and my son, doesnt like it when he is trying to fall asleep with his bottle so he sometimes stop drinking and I cant get him to finish his milk."
4,"Sturdy, no plastic worries","Wife ordered these because of the recent BPA scares. They've held up well to drops and abuse and clean well in the dishwasher even if, because of their height, they need to be loaded carefully. Nipples are a little finicky to clean as they have a small ridge around the inside.No problems for us yet, but there is always a risk of broken and/or chipped glass."
5,"Awesome Price, Quality Product, No BPAs","I love these bottles. They get cleaner than plastic, seem to hold temperature (cold/warm) better, and contain no BPAs. Slow flow nipples work great for my breastfed baby. Nipples were clear silicone, not the yellow rubber ones pictured. They are sturdy, so I'm never concerned with glass safety. Affordable and useful. Buy these bottles over expensive Born Free or Medela plastic!"
3,"Nice glass bottle, terrible nipple","I like that these are glass bottles, but the nipple that is included is way too small. My son's mouth fits completely over it, and he still has a shallow latch. He's only 10 weeks old! I decided to keep the bottles and use them for storage. You could try pairing the bottles with another nipple as well. Also, Target sells this pack for $5."
5,Great bottles - work with medela caps - but nipples suck!,"These are simple glass baby bottles. They're not fancy, but they have no nasty chemicals. I know that the plastic bottles are now all BPA free, but who knows what chemical they'll discover next year that's been leeching out of our plastic and poisoning us all this time.These bottles are compatible with my medela pump and can take the same lids, which is convenient. However, for a breast-fed baby, even these so-called slow flow nipples are way too fast, and caused my baby to choke. I bought Dr. Brown's nipples, which work great. I now have these in 4 oz and 8 oz sizes."
5,Necessity is the mother of invention!!,"I was an Avent user, until this BPA scare, that is. These bottles are excellent. Very durable! I really have no complaints, however, we did have to switch to a silicone orthodontic nipple because my 7 month old could not get the hang of the hard rubber one. For babies who have issues with swallowing too much air, just use the 4 oz. Dr. Browns vent system, with these 8 oz. Evenflo classics, problem solved! (The 8 oz. vent is a tad too long.)"
5,tried and true,I love these glass bottles- the same ones my mother used in the 60's and I used in the 80's with my first baby and am using again with my new babies-twins! They just seem cleaner to me- they shine after being washed in the dishwasher.
1,"Pretty Good Option, Revised Score 4/5","EDITED REVIEW: It seems as though they wised up and started packaging these with the silicone nipples (at least according to the new product description). With the silicone nipples, rather than those horrible hard rubber things, these bottles work very well. REVISED RATING: 4/5, though Amazon won't let me change the stars above.ORIGINAL REVIEW: I liked these classic bottles, and they are safe and BPA-free. However, the nipples are horrible. They are hard and thick. The baby sucks and sucks and gets hardly any milk. It's finally too much work for too little reward, and even our incredibly good natured boy becomes frustrated. Waste of everyone's time."
5,Better than the Alternatives,"These are great! They don't break, I can pump, freeze and feed from them without transfering my precious milk too many times. They clean up easily either when I wash them by hand, or in the dishwasher. There's no icky smell of plasic either. However, this set comes with a hard latex nipple. No child should really be forced to use. You can replace them with NUK, Nuby, Dr. Brown's, Gerber or any other standard size nipple. These really are the greatest. You almost forget the reason you bought them is because of BPA (which if you read...more and more scientist are warning is just as dangerous as Lead). My 6 week old reflux, breastfed baby girl prefers these over anything else we've tried."
5,"A wonderful, safe alternative to plastic bottles-no bishpenol a!","I love these bottles. My daughter is very picky and would drink out of only Dr. Brown's bottles. When I read that Dr. Brown's (and other clear plastic baby bottles) leached harmful amounts of bisphenol-a into the fluid in the bottle, I bought these immediately and worried about whether or not my daughter would accept them (she is also a reflux baby, so she's just a naturally picky eater due to her tummy problems). She drank more milk than I had been able to get her to take in months, I'm not sure why she loves these bottles so much but I just wish I'd discovered this months ago! GREAT bottles! And safe."
3,Does not include plastic storage discs,"If you're looking to this 3 pack to replace the 6 pack that is sold now without the storage discs, don't buy them! They do not include the plastic storage disc cover either and are only a dollar or so cheaper than the 6 pack. I think amazon sells the discs separately but you should still buy the 6 pack instead of the 3 pack. Definitely not worth it and once I opened them to see if they contained the disc, I couldn't return them."
3,Evenflo Glass Bottles,"I chose to go with classic glass bottles because of safety reasons, and for the most part, am happy with my choice. The bottles are great and easy to clean, but the nipples are hard and unyielding. I actually use my Dr. Brown's nipples instead. I also use the internal vent from my Dr. Brown's bottles without the tube. It works great!"
1,Caps leak,"The caps leak on the bottom. I've tried tightening and loosening the caps but that didn't seem to help. While using a spoon to mix the formula I found that some bottles were larger than others and some were out of round (the spoon went in some bottles and not others, it would go in one way but not another). My guess is that I have a bad batch of bottles. I went to Evenflo's web sight but there doesn't seem to be anyway to contact them their about bottles. In anycase the bottles have turned out to be a real pain."
1,These leak,"Don't plan to carry these around in a bag, because they leak. Also, it's very hard to get the top off of the part that screws on and holds the nipple, it keeps getting stuck and you have to pry it out."
4,Great alternative to the dangerous plastic,"Great durable bottles, that are safe for your baby and bpa free, what a concept!"
1,I Really Wanted This To Work,"I love the idea of using glass rather than plastic bottles. Sadly, these just didn't work. I bought the silicone nipples to use, and they just collapsed while my baby was drinking - she couldn't even get anything. When I buy a product, it should be fit for its intended purpose. Here, this is a bottle and my daughter should be able to drink from it, but was unable.I read others' reviews, suggesting to use the Dr. Brown's piece in order to let airflow. I don't think I should have to go out and buy something else for the bottle to work. Also, aren't I still using plastic if I use the Dr. Brown's plastic piece? Sadly, I had to return them. :("
2,Seems like an easy way to save $$...,"I just assumed that the bottles would be made bigger. The neck of the bottle is so small that it is hard to pour the powder in without making a mess. The nipples are a joke. I do not like this item at all. Right now, I am just using them to measure water to pour into my smaller bottles. Definitely not worth even the small amount they are asking for them. I will buy more of the Born Free next time!!"
5,"Decent bottles, great price",These bottles do the job. They're also durable and I don't have to worry about all the BPA scary stuff that I am reading all about. They're also an excellent price. I would definitely buy more.
4,Good bottles.,"First off, I really appreciate the fact that these bottles are made of glass, as opposed to plastic. We try to limit food and beverages consumed in plastic. These aren't fancy and are a great price. You can skip the 4oz bottles and just get a bunch of 8oz ones. Your child will eventually use just the 8oz ones and in the mean time, you can just fill them up with 4oz.While they are great, the rings and nipples may need to be replaced. They are not expensive though, so it's not a huge problem. Our daughter however did not like these as much as the Playtex drop ins. She really had a hard time sucking them. She would have to stop drinking and we would have to wait for all of the air to flow back in before she could continue. Maybe we just had faulty nipples. I'm not sure. I would be willing to give them another try though with our next child."
2,Suction factor,Our child did not like these bottles. They didn't let any air in so it was hard for them. They had to stop feeding and let the air back in the bottle. Not really great bottles.BPA Free!
2,poor air-flow and leaky,"these are the only glass bottles we have used, so i have nothing to compare them too. leaky unless you screw on very tight, but then you have a bad air-flow problem and my baby gets frusterated. we figured out that you have to mess with the lid a bit in order to find the right flow with out leaking. kind of a pain. but these are cheap and glass IS best."
4,Great price! Safe & Timeless Bottles!,"These bottles are great! Bisphenol-A chemical free, unlike most plastic bottles. Much healthier for babies, less expensive, and easier to clean than plastic bottles. My son refused to drink from the latex nipple, so I purchased some replacement silicone nipples from Target for about $3. Glass bottles are hard to find in stores, so this is a great Amazon find!"
2,Not for Colicky babies,"I bought these glass bottles after reading all the articles about bispenol A. My daughter was used to the Dr. Brown's bottles and could not get used to this classic bottle. She got so much air when she sucked on the bottle, we could not use it."
4,Nice Glass Bottles,"I purchased these bottles after hear that toxins can leak into the milk from plastic bottles. These are very nice, thick glass bottles. They do come with a rubber nipple, so if your baby is used to silicone nipples you will need to purchase them separatly."
4,Good product,I tried to switch from Avent bottles which are made of plastic # 7 and this is a good choice at good price. I use Dr.Brown nipples as someone suggessted and it works fine.
2,Do not buy it.,"The bottle part is all right. The cap and nipple have poor quality. You have to tighten the cap very hard to seal the bottle, otherwise milk will leak. I bought bottles with slow flow nipples, and my baby does not like it. Even when I change to Evenflo fast flow nipple, she does not like it either. There is no hole in the fast flow nipple, only a ""x"" on it. It is poorly designed, and it takes my baby very long time to finish one bottle of milk. I would not recommend this product."
4,Good bottle - great price,"These are good basic bottles. Going to the baby store and shopping for baby bottles as a new parent was daunting. There's a litany of choices and every imaginable variation on design. How do you choose? For us, it became simple when we decided to stick to glass bottles. There aren't many choices out there in glass, and those that are available are usually very expensive. Our daughter has had no problems eating whatsoever so I can't say anything about any of the specialty bottles on the market, but for most babies, I can't imagine needing more than a basic bottle. These are more or less the time tested glass baby bottle. Basic and no frills, but solid and sturdy. We like them a lot, and the price is very affordable."
5,Glass Baby Bottles,"I am pleased with this purchase. With all the scare about plastic bottles, I wanted to find some good old fashioned glass bottles. Thanks Amazon!"
4,Wonderful and Inexpensive bottles,"I have used the bottles for four months and really like them. I have a Medela breast pump and the bottles fit directly on the pump, allowing me to pump directly into the bottle. I use Dr. Brown's nipples because the ones that come with the bottles seem kind of hard.According to the book, Baby 411, antibodies from breastmilk stick to plastic, but not glass. I believe the authors of the book recommend glass bottles."
4,Clean + Pure Feeding,"I cringe at the idea that I fed my baby from heated up polycarbonate bottles. I might not be able to breastfeed my baby, but with my new glass bottles, at least I know that I am feeding her the purest form of formula I can possibly give. She hated the taste of the latex rubber nipples so I bought some silicone ones and was successful.When I consider the epidemic of autism in this country, I am dedicated to buying pure, organic baby products and avoiding using plastic products especially when heating in the microwave."
3,"glass is great, nipples for bottle are horrible!","the bottles are great, bpa free etc.however, the nipples kept collapsing and there was no funnel for gas. i eventually switched bottles for my daughter."
5,BEST BOTTLE TO BUY!,"I love these bottles! My son has been using these bottles for 7 months now and not one has broken! Amazingly enough one didn't break even after being droped on a concrete driveway! I find that they keep his milk warmer than a plastic bottle. I would definetely recomend these bottles to any parent. Having glass bottles puts my mind at peace, knowing that my son is not ingesting toxic chemicals when he eats."
4,love the BOTTLES....,"The glass bottles are perfect...no plastic to worry about leaching chemicals, dishwasher-safe, surprisingly durable to being dropped by a 15-month old... My only complaint is they came with latex nipples that were hard, as if they were old. I just threw them out and bought the Evenflo silicone nipples. Other than that, I'm very happy with this purchase!"
3,glass bottles are easy,"The glass bottles are great, although the Evenflo bottles leak when you shake them. I don't like the evenflo nipples that much, so I just bought Dr. Brown nipples to use with the bottles.There is another brand of glass bottles, Nuture Pure, which I like much better, but it is harder to find. The Nuture Pure cap fits better, and doesn't leak when shaken. I bought at the (now) defunct Elephant Pharmacy, although rumor is you can find them at Whole Foods."
4,"good, affordable alternative to plastic bottles","These bottles are great, and I had a hard time finding them in stores around me. They do not seem to give her any problems with gas. I like that they are glass (BPA free), easy to clean and very affordable."
4,Evenflo Glass Bottles,I love these bottles! I had planned to go with the more expensive bottles (BPA free cute bug designs and all) but decided to save some money. I love the vintage look of these and I'm so happy I bought them. As a side benefit they are a perfect fit for my Medela [...] pump. The one problem I have is that my son won't take the silicone nipple and I'm having a hard time finding a latex one that will fit the bottle.
4,"Good bottles, the cap is not so",These are good bottles. Glass is definitely an advantage. Hopefully they don't mix any dangerous chemicals into the glass. But the nipple cap needs some redesign. It leaks unless you tighten it really well.
3,Beware don't use the bottles' ounces to measure!,I've had these bottles for over a year now. We didn't realize right away that the ounces on the bottles are wrong. They are off. So use something else to measure. 6oz. is really 6 & 1/2. The other downfalls are they have a narrow neck for getting formula in and they leak quite a bit. We wound up using the medela non orthodontic nipples on them because we started with the medela bottles this time with the second kid but those bottles only come in tiny size. They leak less with the Medela nipple. Otherwise they clean up great & don't hold any oder. Just don't put cold milk in very hot bottle.
4,Good Alternative to Plastic,"Great Bottles if trying to limit child's exposure to possible plastic leaching, AND I think this is the best place to get them. Easy to clean (in dishwasher on high heat so saves time in regards to sterilizing) and use (still prefer Dr. B nipples and attachments). I would suggest this for any new or experienced mommy with any sort of concern (mild or moderate) about BPAs or other chemicals. Hope this helps in anyone's decision...less time researching means more time with baby...or sleeping. :)"
2,nipple does not work,I have to buy a new set of nipple from Target. My son just can suck anything out of these nipples. The bottlesare fine. Glass is better than plastic.
4,"durable bottles, get better nipples to replace the latex ones","We switched from Dr Brown's Natural Flow bottles because of BPA in polycarbonate bottles. The bottles are really durable -- I dropped them several times on the granite kitchen floor and, each time, they just bounce right up, with no damage whatsoever. The latex nipples that comes with the bottles are way too hard. We replaced them with Gerber (NUK) Silicone Orthodontic Nipples."
2,"Good in theory, leaky in practice","I decided to switch off of the Avent bottles out of concern for the BPA in the plastic. I wouldn't say this is the best choice though. Unless you get the cap screwed on just right they leak or don't vent at all. Also, the fast nipples break down quickly (the hole grows larger with each use) and become more like a deluge of milk soaking myself and my daughter. She medium flow is too slow and she gets frustrated. They also are rather heavy and she doesn't like holding it on her own."
3,m&msmom,I love the glass bottles. After hearing reports of chemicals and synthetic hormones found in plastic bottles I switched to glass only. Other bottles are easier to use. The nipples that come with these are latex and so if your baby does not use latex (which I think most don't) a better silicone nipple that fits these bottles is the Gerber NUK.
4,auntief,"The bottles are great, however the latex nipples that come with it my daughter would not even eat off of. However gerber makes a silicone orthodontic nipple that works well with this bottle."
2,Difficult to use,"I switched to this product because it is glass and safer than plastic according to news reports. The caliberation is difficult to read on the bottle and so I always end up pouring more or less milk than I need. Also, the nipples are not up to par and when I used the Dr. Brown's nipples and vent system, the bottle leaked terribly.The price was very reasonable but I ended up going back to my trusty Dr. Brown. God will protect all our little ones!"
1,not good,"after the bad comments about the plastic bottles, I try to look glass bottle and found this. I bought this but end up never using this. the nipple is too small, and it is very hard to put the powder in. and my baby can't hold it. too heavy."
1,evenflow glass nursers,I like the idea of glass with all of the plastic controversy but the bottles are heavy.
5,Excellent,This is an all inclusive textbook of transpersonal psychology and psychiatry. If you desire to learn more about the field this is an excellent place to start. Fantastic for writing a paper as well.
5,Entheogens: Professional Listing,"""Textbook of Transpersonal Psychiatry and Psychology"" has been selected for listing in ""Religion and Psychoactive Sacraments: An Entheogen Chrestomathy."" http://www.csp.org/chrestomathy"
4,A PLATINUM ENTRY,"I looked around for days trying to find LOVE GROWS, then stumbled across the craziest of notions: Just punch up ""70s"". It was the first one! Listening to old music from the past is like traveling in time. One can actually smell the roses. LOVE GROWS was a big hit in 1970 - the same year my cousin was shot in the jungle of Vietnam. Darling."
3,Excellent Collection... but...,"The 70's was the best decade for music. I call it the golden era of music. Outstanding artists such as Electric Light Orchestra, Led Zeppelin, Eagles, Paul McCartney and Wings, Elton John and Carpenters were riding high on the charts. Unfortunately we don't get any of these great artists on this collection. Yes, there are some excellent tunes included but there's also a great amount of schlock such as Climax's ""Precious And Few and Gilbert O'Sullivan's ""Alone Again Naturally"". This song choices for this set I feel could have been better. Though all in all it is worth giving a few listens."
1,Amazing collection of the worst music of the 70s,"What made the 70's such a bad decade for so many people is collected here. One-hit-blunders from the most tasteless acts ever to populate AM radio. Thankfully, it was all collected in this box, presumably to be sterilized."
4,Great collection of 70's tunes,"I liked that many of these songs fit into the ""one hit wonder"" category, it was fun to listen to them again after all this time. I agree with what many people said about the news snip-its randomly inserted through out - while I didn't completely hate them, it was annoying when I created an itunes play list with some of these songs for a party and all of a sudden the music stops and some weird recorded voice stated speaking about some news-worthy event. I thought they might show up as separate tracks on the CD, providing the ability to omit them from playlists, but that was not the case. Dispite this, I love the box set."
3,Mixed Bag,"It's worth buying because both albums had many brilliant moments. They also had some lame moments which were still, at the least, pleasureable. This averages out to 3 stars."
3,Not as much fun as I would have liked,"We gave this to my daughter for her 2nd birthday -she never really liked it. That whole summer she rode it only a few times and has completely ignored it since. I think it goes too slow to be any fun --I know, I know, you don't want it to go too fast for a two year old but... Is it worth it if they don't want to ride the thing?Will try it again this summer with her little sister :-) We'll see if she likes it better.I will say this; we have NOT had any issues with durability. We've had it for 3 years now and it holds a charge as good as it did when new, still looks great and works perfectly....5/25/10Little sis has now tried it out and I think she likes it well enough but it's certainly not her favorite thing to do. Over all it's still kinda' ehhh."
5,Dora Quad,I bought the Dora Quad for my granddaughter and she absolutely loves it and i couldnt be more happier. It's a durable toy worth the money.
4,slow rider!,"this is a great riders for a small child, but it is pretty slow for my 2+ year old. she would like something that goes a bit faster, but we ae ok with it going slow :)"
4,Great For Small Tods,Purchsd for 2yr old. She loves it. We only wish it had a back-up button. Easy to assemble. Lightweight; She gets off and turns it around now. She is getting better with maneuvering it through the house.
4,Great Fun!,"My daughter just turned 1. She can't even walk yet, but she can get on/off the Lil Quad by herself. She drives this thing all over the front yard! She can't steer, but I don't have to help her too often. Her little friend next door loves riding it, too. Her mom's going to get one so the girls can ride together instead of taking turns. The front wheels stay on fine if they are assembled properly. The stickers do come off easily and get torn. This is a great little ride!"
4,Great toy,"My daughter enjoys the Lil' Quad (and anything Dora). She's 2 years old and my only complaint is that the place for her feet is small--so her feet are never flat on the quad. But she loves pushing the button and ""driving"" herself around!"
1,Must cut grass to ride,"It's pretty much crap as far as I'm concerned. Main driver gear stripped after about a month of light use. It has problem in grass 3 or 4 days after a cut. I'd understand if my kid was a fatty, but she's a slight thing of a 3 year old girl. Crap."
5,These Things I Wish,"Awesome book! Love the illustrations and is so true of things long ago that children now days don't experience, and need to. Can't wait to share this with my Grandchildren."
5,Old Memories,Excellent book and a reminder of the way things use to be. Book was in good condition other than it was a littlw warped.
4,Post WWII Scotland/France Romance,"It's very sad that Stevenson's books are out of print, as she writes lovely and gentle romances that would please any fan of Rosamunde Pilcher's work, although hercharacters are a bit more conventional. Her settings are picturesque and vivid, and her romances affecting. Altogether a pleasant and satisfying read."
1,Works long enough to shut you up,"I bought this for $500 cash for my husband as a gift. Worked great for a little over a year. One day we start the car and it was completely dead. Nothing worked. Screen black. No response. I looked up online to troubleshoot (maybe a cable wore out) and I come to find out dozens & dozens of people with the same problem that have already tried to replace parts of it and pretty much just told me save your money, don't bother, buy something better. Basically Crap."
5,The Conscious Heart,An excellent book for those who wish to move beyond the trance of cultural and family expectation of relationship in the 21st centrury..
5,Still Lovin' it,"I bought this cd when it came out years ago. My daughter was 4 at the time. She is now 15 and we recently found the CD while cleaning her brother's room. She still LOVES this CD, we now play it for my niece who is 9 months old. It's the only CD that will keep her quiet in the car! It gets us all singing."
5,This Pan is one of the Best pans I have ever owned.....,"Thats not saying that I have owned much of anything else, but I use this pan every night. It is spacious and is the easiest thing to clean after even burning something in it...Ha ha! I have owned it for about 2 months and I am telling you I really have used it every night and sometimes for breakfast in the morning as well. It still looks new....it isn't stained or anything. I wash it as soon as I am done with it and like I said it cleans up so easy and nice. I wouldn't put this in the dishwasher because I had some other non stick pans and my husband put them in the dishwasher and ruined them."
3,Good at first--doesn't last,"This pan is wonderful...to begin with. I've had the pan for about three years. In the beginning, this pan cooks through the meat, sealing in the juices, & provides superior taste. However, the 'non-stick' coating doesn't last very long. If you baste meat, the juice settles in the grooves. It's to the point that the juices & the meat stick when cooking.. Sadly, I have to look for another option..."
3,Odd shape,The pan works great. I wish it came with a lid. It is an odd shape and made storage difficult for me. Other than that I am happy with the purchase.
5,Inspirational,This is one of the best christian fictions I've read. You will want to read it in one sitting because its a page turner. The story is more about love and friendship than about slavery. Anyone who has been searching for their childhood best friend will love this novel.
5,very good support tool,"I just received this guide book for student evaluations. I am a Montessori preschool directress since 7 years and have been searching for a concise, easy to use guide for collecting my observations in an orderly and cohesive manner for sharing with parents and to pass along to my students' next teacher."
2,Overpromises and needs editing,"I turned to this book to get background on the biotech industry. A cursory review of the material showed me the topics were there. However, the book really needed editing for both clarity and style. Yes, the introduction may have been by a Nobel Laureate, but that doesn't mean it didn't need editing. Actually, there is the same introduction in all the books in the series.Since this is a book billed for those new to the field, it should have spent more time on fundamental explanations.Book has good glossary and nice illustrations."
4,Very good,I read about this CD in Country Music and am very glad I bought it. This is very good country music. He deserved success.
3,Pretty good,"I spent five days in Belgrade, and this was the only guide I could find.Pros:Had some very good information for hotels and museumsCons:The section on Belgrade is only a fraction of the bookNone of the maps are easy to find quicklyIt's a little bulky, especially if you only want information for one citySome information I thought should be in a guide was absent (i.e. tipping after a meal)Overall, it served my purposes and may be the only guide for Belgrade/Serbia until more people start travelling there. Personally, I prefer Frommer's Day to Day city guides, but there wasn't one for Belgrade."
5,Excellent Love Stories,"I enjoyed this book very much. Not only I saw the value in the soulmate and angelic concept, but the match between the two. It confirmed my own love story. I have been married now for 17 years and I can identified with many of the accounts that brought these soulmates together against major odds. It also reaffirms that there are many others who have had a similar experience to mine. I hope that anyone who is looking for a heavenly matchmaker reads this book, so they can find their soulmate."
4,Is my Soul Mate in the making?? I hope so!,"After reading this book, it gave me the hope that my soul mate is out there somewhere! This is an inspirational book for anybody who is going through some difficult passages in their life. Most of the stories seem quite believable - though a few of the stories lost my attention! I only hope that at some point, my own story will be a part of one of Brad Steiger's inspiratioinal books."
3,3 stars; maybe 2,"I loved the idea of the book, and also loved that there were photos (to add credibility), however some of the people seemed so far out (Ra Ja Dove), that I really had to wonder if they were ""all there"" to begin with, and therefore if aspects of their love stories were genuine or imagined. Some of the language in a few of the stories is a bit ""new-Agey"", and found that personally, I was so badly wanting these (""soul mates/destined loves""), stories to be true, that I glossed over some of the sappy language and had to suspend my normal scepticism. I think someone normal, looking for fated love stories would probably find this book a little hard to believe. I hope predestined love exists, and a strong point of this book were the photos of the couples, but perhaps another book about this subject would be more convincing."
3,Stiff leather,If I hadn't gotten these boots at such a good price I would have sent them back. The leather is very stiff and remains that way after several wearings. It is true to size and width but I wouldn't recommend this boot.
4,Must-Read for Political Junkies and History Buffs Alike,This book recounts the nation's closest election with fascinating detail. The authors' genuine style of storyweaving lends the impression that the fly on the wall must have had a Washington Post tape-recorder implanted in it's wing. Deadlock was not at all like re-reading the same old newspaper articles again; this book casts a fresh look at the dramatic strategy game that took place in Florida. I enjoyed it as a self-professed political junkie and my husband found it equally readable as a historical account of remarkable events.
5,Best book on 2000 election,"I followed the 2000 election with academic interest during the confusing aftermath. This book (along with ""Supreme Injustice"") is one of the best on the subject. It reads like a mystery novel and paints the most complex legal arguments very articulately.A true insiders view of the 2000 election, I strongly recommend this book to anyone wanting to get a good picture of the events that led to George Bush winning the whitehouse, despite getting half a million votes less than his opponent."
3,Excellent Primer,"If I could have given DEADLOCK another half-star, I would have. It's a fine, straight-ahead account of the disputed Florida election, and I've got only a couple of negative things to say. For one thing, there are a great number of characters who pop in and out of the book, and I wish the editor would have inserted a Cast of Characters page. And for another thing -- and this is not anybody's fault -- we know, almost four years later, more than the authors did when they wrote this book, almost immediately after the election. As I finished, I wanted to know the results of all those after-the-fact recounts that were conducted by various news organizations. But I'll have to find another source for those (though it's pretty silly to even care, at this point). Overall, a quick and informative read."
1,It's still the same old story...,"I found this book exceptionally boring---which is quite an accomplishment for an election as exciting as 2000. There was absolutely nothing new in here---no news, no creative and original analysis, and nothing besides a repetitive rehash of the Washington Post's coverage of the election and recount. Very, very disappointing."
4,Fun Toy - Good Reproduction,"I had a ""Robert the Robot"" as a kid and enjoyed driving it around with the controller. This reproduction is a fairly accurate copy and has a lot of play value. The only change is that the robot voice is now electronic...the original toy had a record disk inside. It would have been wonderful to duplicate that aspect as well but only a purist would be disappointed with this toy. This reproduction would be a nice addition to your robot collection!"
3,light of evolution,A wonderful resource for a biologist: nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution. Why the book has so few images?
5,Interesting in many ways,"Here are three cases where you can find this book very interesting:1) You are interesting in the mathematical foundations of Information Retrieval, and a new and powerful approach to them catch your attention.2) You are not very familiar with Quantum Theory, but you are not willing to go across lots of physics (movement of particles, experiments, etc.) and just want to learn about its most relevant logical features. The book explains them in a very clear way.3) You are familiar with Quantum Theory, and suspect that its scope goes beyond physics, to the realm of information itself. Then you find this book, where it is proposed that the quantum language is a natural choice to formulate the foundations of Information Retrieval, a science of information handling.Whatever your case is, do not think that the level of abstraction of the subjects treated will make this a difficult book to read. The argumentations are clear, simple, and the way it is written is very entertaining ."
5,"Nice, comfortable cap",This is a very comfortable and good looking hat. I always wear it when I drive my 98' Vet
2,Slow and boring,"The action is great, the little there actually is. This could have been done in half the the episodes or even less. I think there was only three real battles and they lasted all 25 episodes. One character would be fighting while the others would just be standing around, complaining, whining, or trying to get in touch with how they feel about killing ""Aliens"" and this would last for 3 to 4 episodes. It just took to long to develope and the characters were boring. Kai the main character was the only bright spot in the Anime the others were boring and annoying. Borrow it, dont buy it. If you are looking for action and great stories try Beserk/Claymore, both are a lot better than Gantz."
3,Cant decide if its a great anime... or an epic fail,"maybe its both. there's WAY too much dialog, too uneventful BS thats completely uninteresting, and they kill off characters that I liked way too often. I dont mind seeing characters I like get offed, but seriously they got too happy with it. dont even think about likeing any character in here, they die. and its never a good death, its useually a really stupid one that annoys me. but truth be told when all hell brakes loose its pretty hot, and they dont have a problem with gore. if only they would stop having 8 guys stand around with guns while one or two people through down with the giant statue monster thing."
3,"Same Songs, Worse Remastering","It was interesting to hear the songs in chronological order. Also the inclusion of the slower, throatier, American single version of Ring Ring was something only a die-hard ABBA fan that actually HAD the original American LP release of Waterloo(which is where it originally appeared) would appreciate. The major disappointment here was the trebel-heavy, bass-deprived remastering of these songs for this compilation. They were not remastered at the same standards as the ""Thank You For the Music"" Box Set or the REissue of ABBA GOLD. I would not recommend this when higher quality ABBA collections are available. Instead, pick up Forever Gold and get a thoroughly entertaining, quality compilation."
5,A great disc set for beginners and huge fans!,"I am one of the biggest Abba fans in the world, and have purchased many compilation sets by Abba, This is truly one of the best. It has all the hits from both UK and the US, and if they added 'Rock Me' it would have included all the big Australian hits too. I love that it's in chronological order giving the listener the chance to hear the progress of the group from the beginning to end. My favorite track is 'The Day Before You Came'. You hear all the pain the group is going through from Agnetha vocals, to the howling background vocal and the simple use of percussion-simply brilliant- I put it on a lot of mix tapes I give to friends. If you haven't purchased an Abba album, this is the one. You get all the great songs, and it leaves off the misses that might be on a few other albums (though that's rare in my opinion). Enjoy! Buy early, buy often"
5,Great Oldies Group,"This group is such great song writers and singers, that I just had to have this to enjoy for the rest of my and my children's lives...yes, after the movie ""Mama Mia"" many generations know and love these songs, great music lives on forever!"
4,You'll love it....,"After seeing ""Mamma Mia"", the musical, in Las Vegas, I was hot to buy a CD of the music. This album did not disappoint. If you like ABBA, you'll love this CD. The price is right at Amazon."
5,Great music,"After seeing Mama Mia it revived my interest in Abba music, which I had on LP's. I wanted the original music, not the movie soundtrack and this contains all the songs + many others with the wonderful voices of Abba. It's a great 2 CD set and a real bargain!"
3,sound quality not so great,"This is a fairly comprehensive collection but I play it only in my car CD and the sound quality is only fair compared to CDs released in more recent years. Altering the bass, treble, etc helps a little, but I wish I had purchased a different compilation album."
2,Bad recording,I bought this as a gift for my mother who loves Abba but returned it as the recording wasn't very good at all. At times it doesn't even sound like Abba!
4,a great listen,I have really enjoyed listening to this album. I can listen on my lunch break while I read the latest novel that I have on my Kindle Fire.
3,abba,I had no problem other than the cd case was broke and unusuable. It probably was from shipping. The quality of the cd is great and I received it in the given time.
3,Good collection. Terrible sound.,The sound quality is really bad for what is a very good collection of their songs.
5,fabulous!,"This is ABBA, complete and on 2 cd's. If your an ABBA fan, it's all here and then some. Over 40 songs. Awesome!"
5,ABBA superstars,ABBA is one of the top groups of that era and all the songs on this album are wonderful and to my liking.Their voices blend very well indeed.
5,Great service - great CD,Very pleased with the service and the CD itself. We've been enjoying it ever since it arrived.
3,mainstream,There was nothing about this album that stood out for me. It was status quo for me. But if you're a jazz fan this is an ok album to add to your collection.
4,"It was ""Way UP""","This was a fun cd, and a great sound. I would really recommend it. All of Wayman's music is great and easy listening. Just an enjoyable collection of sounds. The man truly had talent."
4,Great Conglomeration of Classics,"This is a wonderful combination of classic Christian authors each contributing the best of their works. From Brother Lawrence to John Wesley, these are the guys that founded the churhc as we know it today. Read their passions and you will be challenged in your own walk with God through them!"
4,Comfortable wearing CW-X tight running pants.,"This tight is very comfortable. I have worn it a couple of times during 10-mile bike rides. I would not ware this tight for long bike rides under 40 degrees, though. If you decide to buy it, it runs short. I'm 5'7 and have an athletic body but the medium size feels a bit short (legs and waist). If you have an average body type or more than that, I recommend you go with a larger size."
3,not that hot -- not that warm,I found there claim for insulation is overstated. I still had to layer even at 15-20 degrees. They were ok but I expected more.
2,excellent condition NOT SPANISH,"Book was sold as (Spanish Edition) which was totally false. Shipping costs were concealed, multiple pieces sent in the same package make no difference to this company. It's a book my kid will enjoy, but I could buy a dozen just like it at a thrift store. I wanted Spanish."
3,Holocaust Historian,"The DVD's were very informative, however, there was too much of the same information on each DVD."
5,Helpful,"This text was used for my doctoral ethics course, the book is full of case examples, detailed information as it relates to the APA code/principles; this text is definitely one I will be referring to in the future."
5,GREAT!!! MAYBE THE BEST!!!,"The book was supposed to arrive within 2 weeks and it got here in 6 days!!! That was awesome!!!! I mean, the shipping charges weren't expensive at all and the book got here REAAAALLY fast, plus it was in GREAT conditions (the book was new, it still had the wrapping, and it came in a package I considered perfect for books and great for their protection). I DEFINITELY recommend this seller and I would buy from them again without hesitating, THANKS FOR THE GREAT TRANSACTION!!!!"
4,Fantastic Book!!!,"I am an autodact(self-taught), and it's often hard for me to find books that allow me to further my knowledge on my own. This book is a MUST HAVE for ANYONE intrested in the human body or in medicine in general. It provides you step by step procedures for locating parts of the human anatomy and how to examine them. The edition is a little old, but the information is still valid. #If you can, purchase the workbook when you get the guide.. it enhances and reinforces your knowledge!!!!!"
4,Deep satisfying cuts from the days between disco and MTV.,"Even though this CD has only one or two songs that the average top 40 radio listener has ever heard, it doesn't stop it from being a revelation of how good dance music was even after disco supposedly died. A couple of songs tank and a couple are embarassing, but overall this is a great party album for 30-somethings (I recommend putting all the Billboard Disco/Dance CDs from 1976 to 1981 in a CD changer and letting it be the DJ for the whole night)."
5,The all-around solution for web design.,"Dreamweaver MX, Fireworks MX, and Flash MX are the perfect trio for web design/development professionals. With the more seamless integration which MacroMedia has devised for this upgrade, they are even more valuable to you.Dreamweaver provides the easiest WYSIWYG design capabilities I've found. MX also incorporates all of the features previously found in Dreamweaver UltraDev. Round-trip editing of Fireworks and Flash imports makes this your total web solution.While I've always preferred Illustrator over FreeHand, and ColdFusion is strictly for the PC platform, the set is well worth your investment. And, if you're a fan of those two programs, so much the better."
4,Pretty good prog from Japan,"This is very melodic symphonic rock (i.e. progressive rock) from Japan. Beautiful, operatic female vocals and lush keyboards dominate, with elaborate, rich arrangements. If you're a fan of other Japanese symphonic prog bands with female vocals (Pageant, Mr. Sirius, Providence, etc.)-- or if you like old school symphonic prog (especially Renaissance), you'll probably like Cinema. It's not the most original or most memorable prog you'll ever hear, but it's certainly very well done. (Prog-haters, of course, should stay away...)"
2,Not the greatest...,"I bought this chair for my 16 month old son. I wanted something for him to sit on when he watches videos or looks at books. As soon as he sat in it, the back of the chair started bending backward until the chair practically tipped over! It was also very small for him and he's not even 1 1/2 years old yet! I guess for the money it's not a bad item, but it's not what I was looking for. He did like climbing on it after it tipped over. Also, the zipper was missing the zipper pull making it very difficult to unzip the cover. I ended up returning it the same day I bought it."
1,Disappointed,The plastic test dish was broke... had to throw away the kit. Was not worth returning it. Will continue to boil my water.
2,Couldn't understand,I could not understand how to count the colonies. Now I will have to buy a different test and start over.

1,Wrong edition sent,"The book sent by this seller was the 4th edition. I bought an 8th edition. Obviously, they sent me an outdated wrong book!!!!"
2,"Great idea, Horrible execution","The general idea is really brillant and Rick Gervais could have pulled it off had the script been tighter and the idea development been stronger. The jokes that were to be had were really pretty much covered in the trailer; everything else was just kind of an extension of those. Even the whole foray into religion seemed to be 45 minutes dedicated to a joke that could last about 10.Also, about 30 minutes of the movie deals with finding a partner with the right genetic code (as opposed to the one your in love with, i.e. makes you happy). This seemed out of left field in a movie which showcases how venal people really are when they stop lying."
4,Modestly Funny,"Gervais took a really good idea and did a so-so job of running with it; it's a long way from being unable to lie to having to say something obnoxious or ridiculous about everything. Some of the characters blurt out things that are funny, but not realistic even within the Universe as Gervais saw it. Yet, on the whole, the film is modestly entertaining and moves along pretty well.The film is religously irreverent in a European sort of way, with Gervais doing a pretty funny Moses bit. As a result, the Christian Family Hate League put out a fatwa against the movie, and a number of reviewers on other sites panned it without seeing it. It IS worth seeing."
5,Hilarious,"This is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. Ricky Gervais has a very British sense of humor, so it may not be for everyone. Also, you may want to know that this movie is very blatantly made from an atheist perspective, to the extent that some may find the plot almost hostile to Christianity. If you take it lightly and just enjoy the movie for its entertainment value, though, you'll have plenty of laughs! :)"
5,Clever movie,"I loved this movie. The overall tone of the movie is very sarcastic and subtle. I loved that. It poked fun at religion--so what? Get over it, it's just a movie. (I loved the pizza box tablets) It should make you think about all the things that you think to yourself during the day. Imagine saying every one of those thoughts out loud. It makes you think about how negative people can be, and how they can get so caught up in life's disappointments. Nothing blows up, nobody is half naked, it's just a smart movie that makes you think."
3,So so movie,"If you like Ricky Gervais, there is a pretty good chance you will like this. Everyone has covered the most relevant points, the most ridiculous being the issue of people taking the religious perspective too seriously. C'mon people, it's a movie and the ""man in the sky"" bit is hilarious! It is a bit slow at times but the only really off thing was the miscasting of Jennifer Garner. I LIKE Jennifer Garner, just not as a romantic interest for Gervais. NO chemistry like he had with Tea Leoni in Ghost Town for instance. I had this as a 2 day On demand rental and I only watched it once..didn't even fast forward to the funny parts."
5,Excellent!,"Delivery was fast, and the DVD works perfectly. Movie is a great comedy with a really good moral, there should be more movies with this kind of depth to it. Sarcastically funny."
2,Displeased,"While I usually like these actors and actresses, this film was not entertaining. It was boring. The premise of the story was ridiculous and it did not turn out to be very funny. I found myself wondering repeatedly if I should watch it to the end or not. I did, but I would not recommend this movie to anyone to watch."
2,Interesting premise ruined by Hollywood script,"This movie had so much potential. The premise has been visited before but not necessarily as directly as the first 15 to 20 minutes of this film. After the set up, this film could have gone one of two ways. It could have explored the darkness created from the lead character's decision to start lying. We could have been taken on a very deep roller coaster ride exploring the ramifications of his decision. (And by darkness, I don't solely mean depression. It could have been handled in a comedic fashion too). Or the movie could do what it did; become one of the umpteen million typical hollywood movies that gets bogged down in resolving the age old guy meets gal baloney.One extra star for the cool premise. Bad review because it ultimately just turned out to be another very formulaic ""chick flick"". I don't mean to put down the folks that enjoyed this movie. I just found it incredibly disappointing and unoriginal considering the potential it held."
3,The First Lie Rules the World!,"Imagine a world where people expressed exactly what they felt without the filtering process derived over 12,000 years of civilization. Also, imagine no one harboring nefarious motives, just pure and innocent honesty. Now, think of the first person to utter a lie for the sake of personal enrichment. What you have is ""The Invention of lying."" It is often believed that good stories are reworked from old stories we've come to enjoy. Subliminally, this story is ripped from the story of Genesis in the Bible. A peaceful place upset by a character with selfish intentions. To a great extent, the movie is satirical, but also makes effective commentary about traditional religion without being sermonic.In addition, witness how manipulation takes over when society is steeped in ethics and conservatism without regard to diversity of thought.A decent movie based on a compelling concept.Edward BrownCore Edge Image & Charisma Institute"
4,interesting,"This movie is not a comedy. I felt at times the truthful blurts were a bit much. However, it was interesting to see the main character grow and change and I loved the ending. Worth renting wait to buy."
1,Slowest Movie Ever,ricky gervais obviously pressured this cast to sign up for his movie. there is no way all these talent actors and actresses would have read the script and actually wanted to be in this movie. it must have been a favor. it's horrible!
1,Worst Movie EVER!,They could have done so much with the idea of the first ever lie and they ruined it with a cast of bad leading men and a random appearance by Tina Fey where she didn't even get achance to do her comedy magic. Overall this movie is a huge dissapointment and just alltogether bad.
1,"Not What I Expected, Let Down...","Ok, so I was excited to finally see this movie whenever it came out, but once I did... What a HUGE let down! Wow. All of the best & funniest scenes I had already seen in the commercial/trailers. So, Not only would I not spend the money to buy it I wouldn't even rent it. If you're looking for a movie to make you laugh, look further. Not the worst movie I've seen, but for me personally it was such a let down. Should you watch & completely disagree, I honestly would be happy about that. I'll even admit part of my review could be due to the fact that I may have just built it up in my mind to the point of when I did finally see it there was ALMOST no way it could have lived up to to my expectation. I don't know about that, but either way, hope this helps. Oh, & had this been the standard 4 star rating system I would have rated it a 1 star, but since it was a 5 star rating system, as you see, I gave it 2 stars."
1,Offensive,"My husband and I couldn't watch the film all the way through. Once we realized it was a movie portraying God as a lie, the movie turned from humorous and cute into something extremely offensive and hurtful. A waste."
1,A Mockery of the Christian Faith,"This film was a total mockery of the Christian Faith and I was offended by it. If hollywood was mocking the Islamic Faith or Buddism, etc., our country would be up and arms about it. It looks to me that Christians are still being persecuted for their faith in Jesus Christ even in America. Remember, America was founded on God and our country is all about freedom. The only real freedom is the freedom found in Christ alone."
1,"Totally, completely, absolutely UNfunny","This film claims it is set in an alternate universe where everyone tells the truth but that itself is a lie. What it is is a world where everyone is venal, stupid, vacuous, vicious and tells not only the truth, but every single thing they think, which is not at all the same. If you care about what your kids watch, and I suspect few do, keep your kids far from this. The jokes are about masterbation, excretion and cruelty. This film is the perfect example of what is wrong with Hollywood---it tries way too hard to be funny and succeeds only in insulting anyone gullible enough to watch. The marching morons (read it:The Marching Morons) have triumphed."
1,Extremely Disappointing,"Although I've always liked Ricky Gervais, I was extremely disappointed with this one. Although it was somewhat entertaining at times, I found the concept of God and heaven being ""a lie"", soley created by an individual, offensive. I believe in freedom of speech and everyone is entitled to their own opinion - but if I had known what this movie was about, I wouldn't have wasted my time watching it. I don't recommend this one. And, based on freedom of speech, I'd like to say ... shame on you Ricky."
1,The Invention of Poor Script Writing,"Firstly let me say i love Ricky Gervais and have no problem with the ""poking fun at the christian"" component of this film however this fails miserably as a comedy. With such an interesting cast (including many cameos by well known faces) and concept (everyone on earth speaks nothing but the truth except one man) this should have been far better. Most of the jokes fall flat and the romance component is as tired as an old dogs hind legs. Whilst Ghost Town was mildly amusing this unfortunately falls into the category of dud. The only thing of interest i found in this film was a particularly well acted scene featuring Ricky Gervais dealing with his mothers death. Ricky demonstrates the depths of what his talent is capable of here showing unseen sides to his personality. Perhaps a drama next time Ricky......."
3,Ricky Gervais,Although this movie had a good ending and was not bloody or violent it was not as funny as I was expecting.. I liked the cast but the movie was only so so.. moved very slow.
3,"Great idea, flawed execution","Much has been said about the premise and plot of the film, so I won't go into that. My problem with the film is this: The central idea of the film is that the concept of lying - saying something other than the truth - has not yet been invented (at least, not until Ricky Gervais does so). However, much of the movie's humor revolves not around lying, but on simply saying whatever happens to be going through the characters' minds, without any editor.To me, it does not follow that not being able to lie is equivalent to saying whatever you're thinking. Nor does it equate to being completely insensitive about the feelings of other people, which is what most of the characters in this movie are. I suppose you could make the philosophical argument that withholding the truth is the same as lying, but I think that it is possible to tell the truth without telling the whole truth."
4,Original,"The premise of the movie is very original. And they never break the premise through the whole movie. The ability not to lie seems to also translate into the inability to hold ones tongue, leading to extremely awkward and funny moments.The cast does a good job in their roles. Only the main character grows but as no one else develops the ability to lie this seems in keeping with the premise.Good movie to watch once."
3,This would have been a hilarious short film,"There's one very funny sequence, but the rest of the film is not very good. Once you get past the sequence of Gervais giving everyone religion mounted on Pizza boxes, you can stop the film. Unfortunately, before that is just a set up and after that is filler. But the part from visiting his dying mother to after the pizza boxes is pretty funny."
5,I Loved It!,"I thought this movie was very funny! I also thought it was very intelligent and even touching at times. Brilliant stuff! Any Ricky Gervais fan and/or atheist should enjoy this. Religious fanatics should probably stay away, though.By the way, I don't believe that Ricky set out to attack or make fun of religious people with this movie. I'm sure he just firmly believes that the idea of a God is pure fiction... and this belief inspired him to make a very funny movie about that subject.Keep up the good work, Ricky!"
2,Strange but uninteresting,"I thought this was some of the weakest written script I've heard in a long time. I thought it would at least be funny but I barely cracked a smile. The odd world is too consistent to be funny or unpredictable and the premise is boring after the first 5 minutes. The acting was decent but there were no good scenes to test the acting at all. Of course, it was completely atheistic in it's message and mockery of religion, but at the same time it was so incredible (as in, not believable) that I found it more boring than offensive. I finished the movie only because I'd paid to rent it and could multitask to avoid sheer boredom. Don't waste your time or money."
2,"The story is OK, the message is terrible","This could've been done a lot better without the anti-religion bias. I agree with another reviewer that it was just over-the-top. It could've been done once and I might let it slide, but it felt like it was the whole second half of the movie (after his mother dies) and just kept going downhill. Seriously, bad taste."
2,"Good idea, bad delivery","The idea of this movie were ingenius, particulary the dating interaction where men and women are completely up front about their desires or lack there of. Pscyhology experts would probably get a kick out of watching this movie because of the way people are honestly revealing the shortcomings, jealousies, and fears that motivate them. I thought the movie got boring though when the main character started using his power for good rather than evil."
1,I Didn't Laugh Once (No Lie),"I was hoping for a good laugh when I saw this movie, but unfortunately the only funny parts were the bits shown in the commercials (of course). I really don't think I laughed once. I liked the premise, but it didn't work for me. People not only couldn't lie, they were compelled to share every thought and explain their motives for everything. While I was wallowing in my disappointed boredom, I was suddenly hit with a surprise ""anti-God"" agenda which became a major part of the movie. I found it to be offensive."
1,The Invention of Crap,"<YAWN> A very boring film whose only reason for being seems to be to insult the religious. Paper thin plot, no laughs. They could have done so much more with this theme had they ditched the agenda. Sheer crap."
4,Amazing,it arived be for it told me that it was going to get here its packaged nicely and i would highly recomend this to anyone..... minor complaint my case is cracked in to locations not that big a deal ill just buy a new one
1,One of the worst movies ever,"Wow, where to begin? I will just come out and say it DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE. I feel as though I have lost 1.5 hours of my life that I can never get back."
1,A misrepresentation (not the comedy you think it is),"I wish I had known that this was a movie about an athiest's view of our world rather than the sweet romantic comedy it was sold as in the previews. People can believe in what they want to -- I just wish I had known before viewing the movie that the message of the film was to belittle those us of us that have faith in God and the afterlife. I guess I should feel ""happy"" the movie attacks all religions and not just Christianity. I feel sorry for the actors that took part in this film. If they believe that life is just the brief time we spend in the flesh, I really do feel sorry for them."
1,Hollywood needs to do some research!!,"I found this film very insulting to Christians as it makes it very obvious that Hollywood needs to look at the evidence for Christianity before it makes it out to be nothing but a big lie. The no name actors aren't even worth mentioning. However, Ms. Garner should've known better. I guess she hasn't taken the time to look into the evidence either. Pray for Hollywood."
1,Can I get my $1 back?,"I cut if off after they started getting into religion. I don't care how you spin it, this movie is just an attack on religion. It seems they are churning out all sorts of junk these days..."
3,"Fun film, crappy quality","Movie:Being a huge fan of Ricky Gervais this was one movie I really looked forward to. The premise was promising, the idea was great, and since I pretty much laugh just by seeing Ricky Gervais I knew I just had to get it.Well, the movie is fun. I wish they played it out a bit more, making it even funnier. I kept thinking to myself, ""What would I do if I discovered I could lie, as the only person in the world, and everyone would believe me?"". I'm pretty sure everyone who asks themselves that question would come up with answers that would be more bizarre and crazy than the ideas presented in this movie. I understand that they can't go too far, but knowing Ricky's previous works, I can't help but feel he held back on this one.Quality:I don't know if I got a dvd that had some faults or errors, but my copy looked like a bootleg/downloaded version. Almost like a youtube-video. This definitely made me not enjoy the movie as much as I could have."
1,"Even though I read other reviews, I thought would feel differently","I liked Gervais in ""Ghost Town,"" so I knew I would like him in this one. Oh my gosh! I can't stomach it, and I can't get myself to watch the rest of the movie. I know where it is heading and that is exactly where some of those who gave it negative reviews said, anti-Christianity (i.e. God is a lie). I just can't do it. Nothing is worth that. It was beginning to feel as though it was mocking me and my beliefs. If you're wondering still, read some of the postings from other reviewers who gave the movie one star. They are right."
1,Should be titled The Invention of Blasphemy,"I am not the most religous person. I don't get to church every Sunday but I still found the movie to be very offensive. You can't tell me this movie was not a dirrect insult to Christians. The director did everything short of taking a whiz on the statue of the Virgin Mary. It's too bad too, this movie has the good basic formula to be very funny. I get it the people in this movie speak the truth all the time no matter how awkward and outragious it is. But as you watch it you realize you can only recycle that gag so many times before it gets boring. This would have been better as a short subject on Saturday Night Live. I think the dirrector saw this too and decided to take a sharp left turn use this film as a chance to show massive amounts of disrepect to the Christian religion. At the end of the day the movie did flop so I guess justice was served."
3,If it weren't for lies...,"One thing that I would surely rescue from this movie is the fact that language is a powerful weapon, but it has to be revitalized, as in poetry and literature. We communicate with eroded phrases: ""How's family?"", ""Have a nice day!"" etc. In México, a beggar kid (a kid from the streets) used to be called a ""niño de la calle""; now the government slang has labeled him as a ""niño en condición de calle"", which more or less translates as: ""boy in street status""; a really old person (a nonagenarian) falls in the category of ""adultos en plenitud"": adults reaching fulfillment... but in complete poverty most of the time.If it weren't for the good old lies, we would be forced to live in the top of a rock for the rest of our lives.Have a nice day!"
4,A GOOD BUT NOT GREAT FILM WITH AN INTERESTING CONCEPT,A what if story about a culture similar to ours except it isn't possible for anyone to lie (or even hold off on giving information to questions). . . until the character played by Ricky Gervais shows up. The imaginary culture says a lot to the audience about their culture. How and why we lie and the repercussions in being too honest (in some examples you can see the spirit of the undesirables being crushed) but at the same time why we might lie and why it isn't always bad. There's also some focuses on the afterlife and God which may turn off heavy religious types. Strange in the final cuts that the culture didn't believe in God yet had a Church with a cross on it in the background. This film was the directorial debut for Gervais. The budget was $18.5M and made over $32M at the Box Office. STORY/PLOTTING: B; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE B; HUMOR: B to B plus; WHEN WATCHED: early December 2011; OVERALL GRADE: B.
3,Funny and thought provoking,"In a world where no one knows the concept of truth because no one knows how to lie we might ask, ""but where are the politicians?""Seriously though, brilliant concept for what can be, at times, a laugh out loud comedy with more than a bit of a message. Some fantastic setups for taking shots at religion, preoccupation with physical beauty, jealousy and other. Also a look at just how brutal absolute honesty can be.""In the land of the blind the one-eyed man is king""-Desiderius ErasmusThe same can be said for the one man who finds that he can lie in the land of truths and will always be believed because no one has heard a lie before.Gervais delivers his wry, dry wit along with a good amount of emotional and philosophical content to be digested. I thoroughly enjoyed this film and while it could have used a bit more of a push now and then it delivered its message and its laughs quite effectively.Very funny, thought provoking and recommended."
2,I'm an Agnostic...and I Still Didn't Like This,"Many viewers were upset about this movie's ""anti-religious"" message--a message that doesn't appear until halfway through the movie and which wasn't advertised in any of the trailers. As an agnostic, I wasn't as offended as religious viewers...but it still felt like it was in poor taste to hide the biblical mockery from American audiences.I'm a huge Ricky Gervais fan, and an agnostic to boot...so you would think that this movie was tailor-made for me. Not so. The message of the movie--that Radical Honesty would lead to a world of cynics who do nothing less than put down each other constantly--was a downer. Would it have hurt the writers to put a few nice words into the mouths of the characters? THE INVENTION OF LYING high-concept misfire on the level of Mike Judge's dire IDIOCRACY."
3,"Love Gervais, but this falls a bit flat","I'm a BIG Ricky Gervais fan. I have everything he's done, TV shows, movies (even bit parts,) and all the podcasts, audiobooks and radio broadcasts from Xfm.I was disappointed in this movie. In addition to always telling the truth, everyone in the film seems to have to express every thought they have. It's like they have OCD or something and must blurt out weird truths to complete strangers.And overall, the film wasn't that funny. Garner is delightful, Gervais is fine, but it was just...blah.I am going to get this DVD soon, so I can catch the parts they left out, including Karl Pilkington as a bald caveman. That alone is probably worth the price!"
2,Not nearly as good as I was hoping,"This movie not only relies on its audience believing that its characters are incapable of lying, but that they are all incredibly stupid. Even with suspension of disbelief, it is nearly impossible to become engrossed or even mildly enjoy this movie."
2,YAWN!,I'm sorry folks-I thought this was just about as boring as can be. I laughed a few times in the first 30 minutes-then I was checking my watch to see how much longer it would be. Don't waste your time with this one.
2,invention of lying,i love the movie but the kind this gave me sucks. it says rental on both the box and dvd and the sound quality is bad. also u cant skip through any of the previews at the beginning of the dvd. thats what i get for going the cheap rout i guess.
