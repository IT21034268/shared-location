2,Help...How do you get the lids on?,"Just purchased the 5 pc. pyrex storage set but what is the point of glass vs. plastic if I can't get the lid on? I put lids in dishwasher on top rack..now trying to put lid on...feel like an alligator wrestler. Glad this is just a test otherwise all contents would be spilled out and I still don't have the lid on, have tried all 5 pieces and they are all the same..I need a pyrex pry bar to get them on..will probably send them back if I don't find a solution. Maybe I have to put soap on the edges. or butter, that would at least taste better? Any ideas?"
1,"very thin glass, not sealed at all.","the glass is very thin.only 1 bowl is sealed(the smallest round one)if I heal the small rectangle one, the water in it will be even SPLASHING down. YES, SPLASHING.other 3 bowls are also not sealed at all."
4,sizes,"sizes are a little wierd, but other than that I am quite happy with my purchase. THey stack nicely and the lid is nice and tight to avoid any spillage. I would recommend as part of another storage system."
4,Good sturdy containers,"As expected from Pyrex brand, the containers are good and sturdy, and of course being glass, no food stains or worries about plastic causing health issues. The 3 larger sizes of the 5 are great for leftovers, though the two smaller pieces are limiting in storage. They're great for sauces or just a cup or two of leftover rice.I did find that the circular lids had more trouble fitting over the container, but once you get them on (and stretched out a bit) it goes on a bit easier. And of course the tight fit is great to ensure there won't be any spilling."
3,enigma,I would have given these 5 stars but for some reason the Lids were kind of crushed and there hard to put on.
5,Perfect for storage or cooking,"Great products as always from pyrex and a good variety of sizes and check back as often they have good discounts on Amazon and with no tax or shipping, can't beat it!"
3,It is good but not that unbreakable as you thought,"I bought 2 2-cup and 2 3-cup round Pyrex storage sets for the reasons that the plastic storage sets could have some harmful chemicals. Also I expected that these sets would last longer than plastic ones, but unfortunately, one of the 3-cup ones was broken very easily, although it was inside of a very thick lunch bag, falling from a 1-yard height above the ground."
3,Smaller than I expected.,"I know the capacity of these dishes are in the details, but I was still very surprised at how small these dishes are. In my opinion, they are priced too high for what you're getting."
1,I couldn't put the cap on top of small bows. Too tight!!! not convenient at all.,I couldn't put the caps on top of small bows. they are too tight!!! I found they are not convenient at all. Will never buy this again!
2,Not very Big,I know the sizes are listed but just realize the squares are not cake pan size. They are much smaller. I haven't found a use for them yet.
3,Lids Leak,"We received this set as a gift. The glass has proven durable and it's useful for storing hot foods or reheating without worrying about a plastic container melting or leeching. I very much like that about them. But they are quite heavy by comparison to plastic, obviously. The containers also tend to get stuck when stacked on top of each other for storage, which means they effectively take up more storage space than equivalent plastic containers would. Be aware that contrary to the description Amazon provides above, the lids do not ""seal-tight."" Instead, they leak. Apparently Pyrex has a new line called ""No-Leak Lids,"" which appear to be the same glass containers but with grey plastic lids that supposedly do not leak and have a vent for microwaving (for example, Pyrex 16-piece No-Leak Glass Storage Container Set). I'm trying to see if I can get those lids for my containers."
5,Great Set,"These are great. 2 sized baking dishes for small or larger meals. The bowls are great for leftovers and eating for lunch the next day. If you put in the microwave, the glass bowls get really hot, but other than that they are great.The lids are great on the pans as you can just put the lid on and throw in the fridge after your meal, no need to worry about dirtying another dish or using plastic wrap, great!"
4,great glassware for a great price. no more cancerware!,"I really like these a lot. You get 5 containers and an extra microwave lid. I have found them to have a good seal while i'm carrying pasta or stew in my backpack. I still put a plastic bag around them just in case though. The only reason that I'm only giving 4 stars is because the lids are sometimes difficult to put on, you just have to figure out the right technique. Besides that they are awesome and so easy to clean. It's great not having to worry about any plastic chemicals in my food when I need to heat up my lunch."
3,RECTANGULAR lids LEAK!!,The lids on the rectangular ones leak!Buyer beware!Get a set that doesn't have the rectangular containers.
5,Great for Microwaving!,These are great storage containers for microwaving...it is also much cleaner for storing stuff like fruit than the plastic ones!
3,Nice Idea but Cheaply Made,"I like the concept of glass ""tupperware."" I appreciate that my lunch doesn't smell or taste like plastic. I use the smaller rectangle box for my lunch and it has worked out. It doesn't leak and is the right size.However, one of the lids does not fit onto its coordinating piece in the set. I have tried numerous times to get the lid on, but it does not work. Moreover, I dropped one of the glass containers just slightly on my counter and it shattered into a million pieces. I understand that the product is glass and therefore I should be more careful, but the drop it suffered should not have resulted in complete obliteration of the product.In all, I like the product but wish it was made better. I couldn't find any other companies that make glass ""tupperware,"" so I guess I am stuck with this set for now."
3,Not too good not too bad,"It is not too good because the round bowls are not as big as i expected.Not too bad for that the rectangular ones are somewhat bigger, so i can accept it~"
5,Pyrex,These are smaller than what you think. Great for small portion left overs. I plan to purchase more. Don't microwave or dishwasher the lids. They stay fitting better if you just rinse or hand wash the lids.
3,These things are pretty heavy,"Much heavier than I thought, I bought them to bring lunch to work in, but kinda regret the decision. Also, the lids don't always make the best seal. These are good for storing stuff in your fridge where they aren't going to be bumped or moved around a lot. Using them to hold lunches is regrettable."
3,Gah! 10 pc = FIVE bowls and FIVE lids!,"I would call that ""five piece""!Caveat emptor!Good products though, and it's still a good price!"
4,great,I liked these I wish it had more of the bigger zises in the set. but overall its a great purchase!
4,Nice set.,These are very nice. I like them since they work in the microwave and do not get messed up inside like plastic does. The only thing is they get very hot to touch/
4,release lid bubble for liquids!,"Pro: durable, heatable, all the other good things every other review mentions...Con: lid is a bit tricky if you want a good seal for liquids. The problem is usually that the lids easily trap too much air and you get a bubble. However, if you push the center down when closing the lid and release the air, the seal is perfectly liquid tight. Granted, I did learn that the hard way, but have since never forgotten to unpop the bubble."
5,My all time favorite,I am so glad i got this. It is very useful and I am very very keen on switching all my plastic products to pyrex ASAP
4,Nice Product but lids are not ideal.,"Very solid item and good shapes for lunches, however the lids are not designed well as the rubber is very hard and was difficult to seal. Took me a few tries to get them on the first time."
5,Perfect cooking for two!,"Empty nest, so I use a toaster oven to bake most of our meals. I found this set of bake glassware and it's a perfect to go in the toaster oven. This set was made for us."
2,Missing Lid,"The product is exactly what I wanted, except that I am missing a lid for the small circular pyrex, so it's actually 9 pieces, not 10. I want a replacement, but I don't have a defective part to ship back and I'm guessing sending an empty box wouldn't work. The policy of trying to squeeze everything back into it's professionally done packaging for a missing piece is absurd, time consuming, disappointing and environmentally unfriendly."
1,DO NOT Buy this,"So just 2 months after this purchase, the LIDS are so loose that they dont fit the container any more and they are now worthless to me!I never expected this out of pyrex, its disappointing !"
5,Kinda small,I bought this with the understanding that the glass containers were larger than what I recieved. Too small. They do work good with transporting food to work for Lunch. I would recommend the item. I would just make sure you understand the size. Don't make the same mistake.
5,great storage,"I really like this set, especially because there are lids and I don't need to use saran wrap or anything else."
4,Great Product!,"I bought these for leftovers for the fridge and for my husband to take to work for lunch. The best thing is that they are glass and not plastic. No lingering smells in the container. The 4 stars rather than 5 is for the lids. The draw back is that if anything with liquid is stored in the rectangular set it really needs to be set upright. The lids do not seal well. The round ones do. I can actually ""burp"" the lids to get a pretty good seal. I would buy more round ones for this reason. Though, if your purpose is to stack leftovers in the fridge, the rectangles are perfect."
3,Lid doesn't work right,The lid for one of the containers was too big. Too much hassle to return. So had to cut the lid to fit it.
3,Too Small,"While the pyrex products are great, i use a variety of them on a regular basis, this set has unusually small pieces. They are great for dips/ storage, but are not the right size to bake anything more than one piece of chicken. For a more ""family size"" dish, go with a 3-5 quart dish."
3,Disappointed!,"I was very disappointed when this set arrived. I was looking for the a set like this that included a square or rectangle dish large enough for casserole or baking. I thought I had found exactly what I was looking for when I seen this. I was sad to see that the actual pieces DO NOT resemble the sizes shown in the picture. The sizes are MUCH smaller and will serve the purpose of carrying dishes for lunch or something. I would return, but its not worth the hassle."
1,One of the box is unusable now,I noticed that one of the box lid was very loose so its difficult to carry liquids or anything that spills as i am scared my food will spill all over. They should have taken care of these lids better. With only 4 containers that are useful i think this turned out to be costly purchase for me.
2,Description on sizes would help,"I liked the set, but the exact size description would have helped while we are browsing to buy the items.The description with size of individual dishes would be great,I was disappointed with the size of the dishes as they are very small and not as we imagined.Padma Ravula (Madabushi)"
3,Not airtight,I made the mistake of thinking that Pyrex would make only airtight products. I have the vent-a-lid system from Pyrex and it's great.
3,"10 pieces includes the lids, actually 5 storage containers","Not a bad deal if you get this cheap, smaller size containers but work well."
4,Better than Plastic Containers,"Glass containers are better than plastic containers because they do not stain nor smell. For health reason, it is safer heating food in glass than plastic. However, the plastic lids will wear out over time."
3,not much room in these,"these containers are much smaller than i expected, the pics make them look big, but there still pyrex, great quality."
2,Blue lids crack after a year or so.,"As in the subject line, my bowls are fine, but useless owing to lack of lids. Every single one has cracked and had to be discarded. I recommend the Anchor Hocking true seal instead as so far those are just fine."
2,"Good for storing, heating - not for traveling","I purchased some of these about two years ago. Love the idea of storing in glass, not plastic - no absorbing odors, no more red pasta sauce stains, etc. But, if you're taking them to work, beware. The lids on mine were tight, then after a couple of washings in the dishwasher (supposed to be safe for this) they no longer fit the bowls and have a tendency to slip off."
1,EXPLOSIONS!!!,"I like the idea of these things, and they are definitely good for storage, but yesterday I spent two hours making the best enchiladas EVER and the casserole-sized piece literally exploded in my friend's oven. The magnitude of the event compels me to give a 1-star review."
4,Product quality,"Very useful sizes, great for leftovers. Although, the plastic tops not the same Pyrex quality that they used to make in the 80's & 90's. Despite this I would recommend the product for purchase."
3,round lids didn't fit,Great product but the round lids wouldn't fit. But storing itms in glass is so much better than in plastic!
5,"good product, good company","one of the units came chipped, but looked like that it how it was made. anyhow, called manufacturer, got prompt replacement, no hassle at all."
3,The Picture is Misleading,"I just received this set. They are much smaller than what the picture implies. Be sure to read the dimensions before you buy this. They should put the picture next to something that is standard size, like a dollar bill. Also, the edges of the lids were bent during packaging. We'll see if the dents come out over time and if they seal well."
2,"The price was right, but....","The price was right and I like heating items in the microwave in pyrex, BUT the lids are very difficult to put on. There is no demarkation of where to lift, which means, you must follow the edge of the container with your fingers to insure the lid is sealed on for storage in the frig."
3,Don't be fooled by the name,"This is not your momma's pyrex. It's soda-lime glass, not borosilicate glass. As such, it should be more resistant to impact damage and less resistant to thermal shock. Oddly, one of our bowls split a few shards off the edge while it was sitting in the cabinet. Sounds weird, I know, but it did.We found the round bowls seal quite well, making them great for travel where they might be jostled around and even spend some time on their sides. The rectangular pieces do not seal well enough for that. The containers and lids are both easy to clean."
2,Picture is Actual Size,"That is the smallest set of pyrex I have ever seen. I was thinking lasagna pan, but it was sandwich size. The smallest bowl is slightly larger than a ketchup packet. On the bright side, the company did take it back without any hassle."
3,"Great, but one of lids dosen't fit","I love Pyrex, and would hate to talk bad about it since I have bought several containers with the red lids, but I was very disappointed to find that the blue lid on the round container does not fit at all in this package. Not sure if this has happened to anyone else, could just be a fluke."
5,Good sizes and variety,The variety and sizes of the containers are great. It seems to be durable to me but I've only used them as freezer storing containers for leftovers. I wish that some of the sizes were smaller so it would be single serving sized for a quick meal.
3,More useful for storage than cooking in,"I bought these thinking i could bake as well as store leftovers in them.1. Great for storing leftovers. I like the feeling that my food is not marinating overnight in plastic.2. One quibble is that the lids on the square pieces are a bit on the loose side. I intended to take the smaller one to work with lunch in it, but I don't think I can trust the lid to stay shut. The round lids seem firmer. I have been handwashing all the lids.3. Not super great for baking - only the biggest square pyrex is nearly enough to bake a meal lasting 2 or more dinners."
5,Love these things,"I've been using these for years. My only complaint would be that it would be nice to be able to buy replacement lids easily, as a few of them have fallen on the bottom of the dishwasher and melted. These containers are great to have on hand, and are much nicer than the plastic kind.At first the lids can be hard to put on and remove, but it gets easier after the first few times."
5,"If you are tired of plastic, get these","Nice set and can't beat the price. I was tired of the plastic tupperware getting so dirty looking and of course you can never find a matching lid. This is great, I keep the lids on them."
3,Pyrex bowls,"I think the picture misleads the actual size of the bowls. I find them useful, but I was disappointed as they were smaller than what I expected."
4,"Great, except...",PRO:This product is great. You get all of the desirable qualities of glass storage with the convince of appropriately sized containers with lids. If you look at the photo you'll have a very clear idea of what your are buying.CON:The downside I've found is that the lids get very brittle when cold. Given that these are for food storage this is a major concern. About a week after getting mine I cracked a lid taking it off a cold container. I've started letting them stand on the counter before removing the lid or doing so very carefully. I'm only taking off one star because I haven't had any additional problems / solving the problem hasn't been a major inconvenience.Bottom Line: Recommended for the careful cook.
2,Photo is misleading.,"I bought this at $14.99, thought it's a deal. But the size is so so small, the largest one is something like 7""x5"". Photo is misleading. At least this is not a deal."
2,very smal pieces,"Photo is misleading. I thought I'd be getting larger pieces.Other than that, the pyrex is good quality. Sometimes requires cleaning with scotch brite."
2,pyrex w/lids,"I've purshased this product for the fact that you can stuck them in the fridge one over the other, so after backing you don't need to transfer into a fifferent container, the problem that i've encoutered is the lids,they have some kind of defect on the corners and they don't seal the way they should, the circle ones are worst then the rectangular shape."
3,Not a bad product...,"We got these from the Gold Box, it looked like a great price. The containers are nice, but smaller than I expected. The lids are tight-fitting... a little too tight! After reading the reviews about the containers exploding, however, I will be extra careful when using them and taking them from fridge/freezer to oven/microwave. Perhaps letting the dishes warm up a bit before transferring them to an extreme temperature change will make a difference."
4,Good for lunches,"I bought this set specifically to pack lunches to take to work with me. I wanted glass because you can safely microwave it; many plastic containers release carcinogens when they're microwaved, and I'd rather not take my chances. The lids seal very tightly, although I have not tested whether you can hold something like soup upside-down in any of these containers.Be warned that '10-piece' means 5 containers and 5 lids."
5,Love these!!!,I have gotten rid of all my plastic containers and replaced them with these. They are cleaner looking (who can see through that cloudy plastic?) and the lids have withstood hundreds of trips through the dishwasher without showing any wear at all. I've gotten all different sizes and highly recommend them!
3,pretty great for food storage,"Lids fit very snugly, glass seems durable, sizes are great for dividing leftovers into individual portions. Not sure why I thought I needed fancier leftover storage, but these are great for food you want to store and reheat in one container."
3,Hard to open,"It is nice to have glass contianers for storage - better then plastic - but the tops on the round pyrex are a nightmare to shut and open. not good for elderly. the square ones are easier. My roomate just tried the roudn ones i received and she could not close them either. Sadly, i must waste postage money returning both sets i bought for Christmas."
3,Much smaller than I thought,"I am trying to move away from using plastic so I bought this set; I guess I missed the $9.99 sale other reviewers mention ~ mine was $16.99. I didn't pay super-close attention to the product description but I was suprised at how small the containers are. The description mentions you can bake in these......bake what? One potato, maybe. Certainly not brownies, cornbread, casseroles, etc. These will be good for leftovers & reheating but not much else. Also, the lids on the two smaller bowls are very difficult to put on & remove. Very tight. Overall, not a bad deal but not exactly what I expected. For actual cooking, I still can't beat the Pampered Chef batter bowls with the handle and a lid. Pampered Chef goods are pretty expensive but those bowls are fabulous."
3,It's OK,"All I can say is check the dimensions. Very small containers. They are only good for storing some leftovers. The lids seem to be smaller than the bowls, but with a ton of effort and a rubber hammer (jk on the rubber hammer part, but actually thought about it)you can attach them. If you are looking for tiny containers with hard to attach lids than this is a perfect set."
3,Remember.....These are very small containers,I was very disappointed with the size of this set. They look much bigger than they really are. They are definitely not large enough to bake anything in.Good containers but tiny.
4,It's really a 5-piece set,"This is a good set and inexpensive. However, I think it is a little deceptive to call it a 10-piece set since 5 of the ""pieces"" are just the lids to the 5 containers. In fact, the lids all have removable tabs that are meant to vent steam, so why not call it a 15-piece set?"
2,problem with the lid,"lids are very difficult to put on and one of the lids was broken after 5 days! while the glassware is nice, i will NOT buy it again"
4,Very good variety for most food choices,"The Pyrex stands up to the microwave test and is great for microwaving dishes that can take over 6 minutes, the time when most plastic microwave-safe stuff breaks down. The sizes are good for both liquids and medium serving meals although you'll need the largest size to warm up takeout leftovers.Although there's 10 pieces, you'll usually wind up only using 2 or 3 and storing the rest. For the price, it's definitely worth it."
4,Not bad!!!,"Like the set- but do wish it was a full set of the bowls vs the longer flat ones bc those I dont really use to much, kindof a weird shape! But they are durable :)"
3,Acceptable,"I should have read the size on the pyrex bowls, they were smaller than what I thought however the quality is good."
4,This set makes a great lunch box,"This is the second time we purchased this item. We use it to take lunch at work. Since they are high temperature glass, there is no leeching of chemicals to our food.They are very good quality, high grade glass containers.The only issue we've found is that the lid does not form a tight seal in the rectangular container. Due to this, there can be some leakage, depending on the type of food being carried in the container.That's why I've given 4 stars.The circular containers seal very tightly and do not leak at all."
2,All the lids split,"The lids were difficult to put on and shortly after I began using these, the lids started splitting as if they were too small. I have had them about a year and the last lonely lid just split. I am so disappointed because I wanted to be able to store food in them without using plastic wrap."
4,"Packaging, disturbs me","My wife and I bought two sets of this item. Both of them came undamaged and in good condition. The thing that scared me was that the containers were packaged within a box and arranged in proper cut packaging. It is hard to explain, but I was thinking that it would be easy to drop this box and, depending on the quality of the pyrex, it would shatter. There is not much protection other than the 'sleeves' or slots that these were placed in.Overall, the pyrex looks nice, is functional, and there are no problems as of yet."
2,All lids do not fit snuggly,On one of the pieces there is NOT an airtight seal. The lid is way too big.On two of the pieces the lid fits but it's not very secure. If I put this container in my bag I'd be worried the cover would pop off and the contents would spill out.On the other pieces the lid fits tightly.I am going to contact the company about getting new covers.
5,"Great product, love the small sizes.","This is perfect for leftovers, dips, etc. and can be put in the oven or microwave to reheat. No worries about transferring food or microwaving with plastic containers! Great product, I recommend!"
5,great product,I bought 2 of these Pyrex sets for leftovers. I gave one to my daughter and we prefer using these to the toxic plastic. They are great for serving as well as leftovers.
4,very good deal,"For the price you are paying, you just can't complain. They are decent quality glass containers. The only thing that you need to be careful is DO NOT put lids in the dishwasher even the instructions said it's okay. The lids shrink a bit after i washed them in the dishwasher. It took me 5 minutes to finally stretch out the lid on the glass container again.Pyrex Storage 10-Piece Set, Clear with Blue Lids"
5,Solid and cheap,After using these I'd never want to touch plastic boxes again. Decently made and easy to clean. Perfect size for lunch. Yeah for 13.49 it could not be better.
4,Satisfied,"I want to stop using plastic storage because I often ended up reheating my food at work on the microwave. I am concerned about the chemical reaction of the plastic with my food. The pyrex set is much better in that aspect. It also never stains with lasagna or spaghetti sauce, which is more difficult to clean on plastic containers. The set I received have lids that fit perfectly snug.If you want to use it as a storage, you do not have to open the lid to see what is inside it. The glass is clear and you can see the food well unlike plastic.The only thing I dislike is that now my lunch carry-on will be: 1) much heavier than it used to, and 2) it is breakable as opposed to plastics than I can toss freely on the sink."
5,Love this product,"I loved this product! It was delivered fast and for the price, it's a steal. Great pyrex set!"
5,Pyrex the good container,"This is not my 1st set of Pyrex products I have owned them for years, yeah there are platic containers, but Pyrex there is just that quality you get, you pay for what you get and these are priced very well for the durability, Pyrex is my storage container of choice they have never never failed even when dropped on accident, Thanks you Amazon for a super deal and great customer service!!"
5,Valuable Early Auto History,"If you are hardcore about your early auto history, then you will dig this. Winton shouldn't be forgotten. It's worth adding to your automotive history library for sure."
4,Life as the busiest fire fighter,"Denis Smith writes a wonderful book about the horible conditions of Brooklyn in the 70's. The fact that his station responds to more calls than any other station in the USA, doesn't faze him, but the poverty takes a toll on all of the fire fighters. Engine 82 responds to about 5000 calls every year. If you want to read firsthand about battling fires in freezing cold this is the book for you! It gave me a great sense of respect for these men who protect us, read this man's autobiography."
4,Mr. Smith is a master of description.,"I have read this book twice in the last year and can't wait to read it again. Dennis Smith tells us how he got on the N.Y. Fire Department, made it through the academy, and his life as a firefighter. He tells of the heroism and bravery of his fellow firefighters, and the tradgedy of losing a friend in the line of duty. Comedy, sorrow,action and excitement they are all here with so many others. Once you start you truly won't want to put it down."
2,"My son loved it, but it didnt last long","I was reluctant to buy this because it seemed flimsy and overpriced, but the concept was good. My 2 year old son loved it immediately, but within a few days, the back part of the cushion became detached from the arms and it never folded easily or correctly again. However, we really did get good use out of it for naps etc. He finally figured out that the cushions could be taken out and that was pretty much the end of it."
5,"so great, my daughter loves this!!!","I bought this for my daughter and she loved it! She would sit on it and eat her snacks, watch tv, everything. It was so cute, she looked like a little adult. The only reason we had to get rid of it is because when we were trying to potty train her, she accidently peed on it (hehehe). So we got rid of that one and replaced it with an Elmo one. But I highly recommend it!"
4,Cute sofa,My daughter got this for her first birthday. She is now 2 1/2 and uses it all the time. I wash the cover weekly and it holds up. It is just very difficult to get back together but I have to wash it so often with a two year old and a dog.
1,problem with bakeware,i recently purchased a 13 x 9 in cake pan. i have used it about ten times. on 11/23/01 i used it and had to soak it to remove the honey glaze from it. on 11/24/01 i was getting ready to wash it . so i took it to the sink to empty the dirty water from it and the dish broke in half. cutting both of my hands. i did not bang the pan or anything to cause it to break. i now have stitches in my right hand and steri strips applies to my left hand. has their been any other issues pretaining to your product. i would like to hear back on this matter. so that if there are other problem i can be sure that no member of my family or my friends do not buy this product.i will not know if there is any permanent damages to my hand until further evaluation by a specialist..
2,A cursury look,"As the other review mentioned, this DVD set is available at Ross for 3 or 4 dollars. Even then it is not worth it. I'm a World War buff and the way this set glosses over important events with a sentence or two bothers me. To say things along the lines of ""Meanwhile, the fighting continued in North Africa"" does not cut it. Ethopia was summarized in two sentences and barely a mention of Midway. 3 hours would be enough perhaps to document France, but certainly not all of the war.Do not pick this one up, it will put you to sleep."
5,Absolutely great!,This album is the album to get if you want mindblowing acoustic guitar work. Speaking from the standpoint of one who plays Keaggy's works he is a true master. Favorite cuts: 5. I feel the winds of God today 3. Symphonic Dance
5,GREAT CD!!!!,"I love this c.d. I've owned it for several years, and play it again and again. Phil Keaggy is an amazing guitar player. This is one of my favorite CD's to listen to on a Sunday morning while I read my paper and drink my coffee. I highly recommend it."
1,Not my cup of tea ............................,"I bought this cheap as a remainder soon after it was released in 1991 and only played it in the background a couple of times. Recently I wondered why I had not played it for years.Listening again carefully, I think it is one of the most pretentious guitar recordings I've ever heard. He plays beautifully, but leaves me absolutely cold. I realize many people love it, so all I'll say is if you're new to this artist, listen to the samples a few times before buying it, just in case."
1,simon the boring,Well written but very very boring.Detail is repetitive and very nlikely circumstance for thatt time in history.U don't uunderstand the writer's aversion to reality and trthfullness but I was unable to finish the book.
5,A Knight for the Ages,"SIMON THE COLDHEART by Georgette Heyer is one of her few medieval romances. Simon of Beauvallet pushed and fought his way from lowly beginnings to the height of the realm, but the beauties of the land could melt his heart so he was called Simon the Coldheart behind his back.A different style for Heyer in that this effort does not have the snappy dialogue of her Regency works, but it does fit the period. All the other features are present with a tight plot, crisp and knowledgeable descriptions of the customs and above all the power of the woman who can melt a cold heart.Nash Black, author of Indie finalists WRITING AS A SMALL BUSINESS and HAINTS."
2,Definitely not Heyer's best,"In the early 1400s, the illegitimate son of a lord forces himself into service for his father's greatest rival and rises through the ranks to knighthood. At some point he meets a noble lady who is his prisoner, and they somehow become a couple.I started this book and gave it 70 pages or so but didn't finish it. I bounced off it hard. The introduction said Ms. Heyer did not want this early novel republished and I can see why. Simon's the best at everything--everything, no matter how improbable--except emoting or feeling any kind of fondness whatsoever for his fellow humans. It got old very quickly, and I wasn't interested in hanging around long enough to see him somehow manage to fall in love and become a better person."
1,Did Heyer want this book published?,"Georgette Heyer wrote so many wonderful books that I recommend you skip this one, unless you are trying to read the whole oeuvre or are a serious scholar of the progress of her writing style. It is set in medieval times (as is her unfinished and rarely read history, Lord John) and her gift for dialog and characterization seems to be lost beneath the weight of the armor. If I remember right, according to her biography, The Private World of Georgette Heyer, this book was an early effort which she did not wish to be published. Instead, go on to one of her other novels. For mysteries, I recommend Blunt Instrument or Who Killed the Butler; for romances, any of the historical ones. And if you are new to Miss Heyer's work, you have many blissful hours ahead of you."
2,Not her era...,"I am a devoted fan of Georgette Heyer, and have read a couple of her suppressed books--which number about six, all from her early publishing period, before she found her 'voice'. This was among the suppressed titles, but her husband decided to republish it after her death. I think her judgment on the matter was better, unfortunately.Heyer started publishing at age nineteen, and 'Simon' is obviously juvenilia. Sometimes embarrassingly so--c.f. Simon's affection for small boys (!) and the fact that he falls in love with the putative heroine only after seeing her in male garb. (!!) And unfortunately, the middle ages is not her era. The dialogue is heavy and not particularly realistic--far from her witty efforts in the Regency books.There is the occasional good scene that suggests Heyer's future triumphs--such as Simon's encounter with his father. But for the most part, this book should have stayed in the obscurity to which Heyer consigned it."
5,Phone Stand,"Works very nice, holds phone at the perfect angle and does not affect the use of the phone or handset."
2,Quite disappointing,"Having been to Cape Cod a lot of times, I'm intrigued by the nature. I read the reviews and thought the book would be special, with a focus on nature of Cap Cod. This was not the case. Most of the pictures could have been taken anywhere in the world... I'm not a professional photographer, but have to say that the compositions was not very exciting, quite boring actually."
4,Second Best,"If you didn't count his great Savoy recording of ""Sit At His Feet And Be Blessed"". I'd say this is some of Jessy's very best work. His rendition of ""Too Close"" is the best I have heard from any artist (the song is over 40 years old), not considering of course the master, and writer of the song Prof. Alex Bradford, and maybe the live version by Madame Bessie Griffin. ""I Know What Prayer Can Do"" is also a jewel. Good work Jessy. Stay on the battlefield."
4,Pretty good...,"This is a tough review to write. I read about this CD in both local papers (SF Chronicle, SJ Mercury), had heard Miller on KCSM--maybe even the same concert the sparked this album, so I had high expectations. Sky high expectations.Natasha Miller has a grand instrument and the Bobby Sharp songbook has some nifty songs in it. But Miller is not the second coming of Sarah Vaughn. The disc is well produced, but the result is not quite the ecstatic experience advertised. On the other hand, when was the last time you heard straight, ungimicky singing like this? Awhile, probably.If you like jazz and ballads and a very good singer, this is an outstanding album, even *the* outstanding album that I've heard this year. You won't be disappointed, since the material is neither derivative or overtly commercial. Miller's voice carries you along and so... recommended. Strongly."
5,What Neuroscience Tells Us About the Brain,"This is another one of Dr. Restak's outstanding books. He renders difficult technical information in a readily understandable fashion. Moreover, he explains the ramifications of the research to society. Brain imaging is a hot topic now. It engenders much excitement and hype. Dr. Restak puts this research in its proper perspective."
4,Neurosociety --halfway there,"Dr. Restak provides an insightful look at recent research into the workings of the human brain. My left hemisphere Mini-me says Dr. Restak is onto something. But then again, what does mini-Me know? He's just a loud mouth after thought. The one disappointment is that The Naked Brain does not deliver much in explaining how neuroscience is fashioning marketing and thought control in the modern world. The book promises more than it delivers on that last front. Nonetheless a real eye opener. Or should we say an expose on the structure of the human brain? We're not what we think we are."
2,The Naked Brain,"The book was a disappointment, compared to Dr. Restak's many other fine works. It seems to ramble through many different topics. Perhaps I didn't enjoy it that much was because it dealt with what's influencing the brain from the advertisers and others with devious purposes. Most of his other works focus on the physiology of the brain, its evolution and development throughout life. Topics such as the development of psychology, personality, etc. are a very different realm of brain research."
4,slower delivery than I thought,"This purchase was pretty much perfect, the delivery of the purchase was a little slow, but the book is in good condition and nothing else was really wrong with the purchase."
4,Another great idea from barbie,"My kids begged for this toy everytime they saw it on TV. Of course when they did get it, they were disappointed it didnt come with the bed and accessories like on the commercial. But, overall it is a cute and well made doll. The clothes are a little difficult to get on and off so expect to help out little hands when changing outfits. But still, a cute doll and good buy."
2,not as fun as a real barbie doll :-(,Personaly i would not want this doll even if i was the age of 7 and up but for younger kids it would be o.k. The durability isnt that good because it has a plush body so it gets dirty more easily and cant clean it as easily as with the plastic dolls. She isnt as pretty as the original dolls either. I would not put her on my wish list.
4,great for what you pay for,"great sunglasses for the price. i went through about 9 pairs of these things when i was in iraq because they do get scratched up a lot going out on a tank every day, plus i gave away a couple pairs to my friends. but they are really dark, which is why i loved them, since iraq is located roughly thirty feet from the surface of the sun."
1,Trash,"I used to order my Aviators all the time from The Source Group and they were always clean, no scratches. I tried Private Island and they arrived quick, but they were covered in noticeable scratches and didn't come with a pouch like stated and they barely mirrored. Do not buy these."
3,Get what you pay for,"Usually I can find a great deal on decent sunglasses. I though I found an awesome deal with these. I was sadly mistaken. These are sub-par quality and i'm pretty sure the entire thing is made of plastic. They fit flat on my face, and do not contour whatsoever."
2,:(,"These are a great price, however, they are not very good quality. You definately get what you pay for here. Keep that in mind. I got 3 pair and one pair was warped and I couldn't even wear. One pair the lens fell out of and I couldn't get it back together, so I have 1 pair that acutally does work, but they run super big!"
3,Alright,Not the greatest quality but they get the job done and the price is right for what you get in my opinion i still wear them often.
5,Better than expected,"All three came with cases, great condition, great price. One for me, the wife, and one for whoever breaks the first pair."
2,Of very poor quality,Of poor quality do not recommend these glasses and striped received paint chips fall ... They are not good was a total disappointment!
4,"Great price, average quality","I purchased these glasses expecting a low quality product and a freakishly low price, this is exactly what i received. The price tag is what sold me and i and truly happy with my purchase. the glasses are not quite square but can be fixed with a little tweaking. I would really recommend this product to anyone looking for a three pack of awesome looking glasses at a price a high school student can afford. the shipping was phenomenal and i truly didn't expect them to come so quickly. and the three pouches were a nice addition to the set."
2,ARRGH!!!!,These shades were not what i expected. if you can just buy a little bit more expensive amybe you'll get better quality shades.
1,Not worth it...,"Sure, they're good looking and cheap. But the reason that you shouldn't buy them is the probable lack of UV protection. Mine came with a little tag saying that they were UV rated, but considering the cheapness of the product, I bet it was fake.These are unbranded sunglasses from a factory somewhere in China, people. I'd bet large amounts of money that these things provide little to no actual UV protection. It's not worth it to ruin your eyes just to save a few dollars.Get a decent pair from an actual brand and save your eyes."
2,Not gold.... no pouch,"Guess you get what you pay for ? Ordered for my daughter who really wanted the gold frames. The ""pouch"" was 3 small zip-lock baggies. Not worth the $$ to return, but could at least update the description."
2,"Very cheap, but I suppose that should have been expected","I'm shocked that these have gotten such glowing reviews. They're a great, cheap option for one-time Halloween costume use, but I wouldn't use these as actual sunglasses ever.The lenses are super dark, but offer zero UV protection and scratch very easily. The frames are a very thin, low quality metal that easily bend out of shape. One of the nose pieces fell off on one pair almost immediately. The lenses fell out of the frames on another pair after one use. All three of cases tore at the seams (which were frayed coming out of the box).That said, if you need some aviators to play dress up for a day, they're great and that's why they avoid the dreaded one-star review. Just don't be fooled into thinking these are anything more than costume glasses."
4,Very pleased!,"I love these glasses! They are very cute and cool. In good condition, there is one that has a couple of scratches, but they are two others so it's not a big deal. To be honest I gave the scratched one to my little sister, and she didn't care, she loves them! What really pleased me was I got them three days earlier then the estimate time!"
5,excellent value,"Super value. Really cheap, sorta flimsy but heck....Throw a pair or two away if they break. So far none have broken. Probably not UV glass for the price."
5,the BOMB.com,for the price there is nothing better!!!! my bf got 1 i have 1 and i sold the other and lets just say there's no complaints here. my bf even got into a debate on whether his looked better than some 200 designer shades and hands down they said his. you truly can't go wrong with this purchase
3,"Good shades, had some defects.","When my ordered set arrived, two of the sunglasses had large cracks in the lenses, and I had to send them back. I didn't like having to wait another two weeks for the new ones to arrive, but these are cheap aviators."
1,ub mirror lens aviator sunglasses 3 pack,"This set comes with three sets of glasses which would be great if they were better quality. There was a nice cloth carrying bag that was shown, but I never received it with my order. Also the glare off these glasses is horrible. They may be nice to give to children as novelty gifts or teens who may be going for a 'look', but anyone who needs a serious pair of sunglasses should steer clear."
2,No pouches!!!,"The glasses are alright for so cheap, they are kind of bent out of shape but not too bad. The main thing is that there is supposed to be drawstring pouches with them but all I got were the glasses. My receipt says it comes with the pouches and now that I came back to look the title doesn't say that anymore so it seems like they are trying to sell me short."
4,"good service,good but not great buy",these shades are great for the price. I may be a little picky but they ran on the small side. I had to bend the frames slightly to fit my head. I can write that off as not being able to try them on before buy. Other than that the shades are great. The sun doesn't bother me and they don't look cheap.I'm happy with them
4,coool,got it within 3 days. shiny and clean with black suede pouches. they fit just right but i have a huge head so yea. give em a shot.
4,awesome,i love these glasses they block out the sunny pretty good but overall make u look awesome. i recommend getting several pairs of these because theyre so cheap. their pretty small
3,alright if you like scratches,"three pairs were scratched, one pair to the point that they were useless, but for the price who was i to complain? i won't be buying any more, that's for sure. i don't know who they are but another store will be getting my business"
3,CHEAP sunglasses,"Just a quick line to say that these are cheap sunglasses. They mirror-reflect okay. I'm happy with them for the price I paid, but these are cheap in many respects."
2,Good Price Bad Glasses,"While the price is definitively right, and it's hard to complain when they come this cheap. I'm actually concerned that these glasses may injure my eyes. They are very dark and seem to offer no UV protection at all. When I drive on a sunny day, the light blinds me as if I'm not wearing anything at all.So yeah, if you want something cheap then go for it. But if you want glasses that actually protect your eyes from the sun I'd look elsewhere."
2,Aviator Sunglasses,"Not a very good quality and makes outside images too dark. Still keep them in the car for a ""spare"". Ron Salley"
3,Flaws but bearable,"Each pair I received had minor flaws in the joints and small scratches and spots on the lenses, however, for the money they are very nice."
5,Super Cool,"The package arrived safely and very quickly. All 3 glasses were intact and had 1 pouch each to carry it around. Looks cool to wear and sits comfortably on the nose.In effect,you get what you payed for (if not more)."
1,Review!,"Purchased these on the cheap, to replace my old ones that are getting a bit worn out...scratched. These are TERRIBLE. I do NOT recommend. Not worth a penny. Spend a bit more....get decent sunglasses."
1,Get what you pay for.,"Ordered 3 pairs of mirrored Aviator sunglasses, all were received either scratched or bent. The packaging was horrible and I can see why they were in the shape I got them in, I'm surprised that they all were not broken."
1,No good,"Can't even see out of the glasses the lenses are so screwy. It is like you are looking through a thick fog. Not worth 10 cents. I mean, what good are sunglasses if you can't see, right?"
1,Cheapest glasses ever,"If you buy these, all you will be going for is looks. The frame is cheaply made, I've never seen such poor quality before. I'd be surprised if these were sold in stores. The lenses scratch easily and they can't even completely fold up. The soft pouch is crap too, the drawstring doesn't stay closed."
3,Good for price,"These glasses are what you might expect. Medium to low quality. But glasses are very, very dark - they are like UV 400 protection or something. Cannot be used in lower-light situations, and are not polarized."
4,Pretty good shades,Pretty good glasses for so cheap. I loose my glasses on a well...frequent basis. Order did not come with a cloth storage bag but I have so many of those from the pairs that I lost that I really didn't want another. The glasses were well packaged and arrived quickly.
2,not what they say,"I got these sooner than it said, and then when i got them out, they didnt have the bag they said was with it, and then one pair the hinges were in different spots and they sit crooked on my face, and one pair the arms were so bent that they sit way off on the left of my face, the one pair that had good frames, the lens ended up cracking after about three hours of having them for no reason. i am hoping that i can bend frames and pop out lenses to make up at least one good pair of glasses"
5,Great glasses,"Ordered a 3-pack since my last pair broke. 3 for $9? Good deal. Seem like they're built pretty good, and since there's 3 I'm sure ill get a lot of use out of them before I need to buy more. Shipping was also pretty quick, had them within 5 days. Would and will buy from again."
3,Cheap,Brought the 3 pair about 3 weeks ago and every single one of them is now broke. Just made cheap but ok if u want some cheap sunglasses you don't care about
5,Incredible Quality!,"I recently bought a pair of sliver framed mirror lens Aviators from Walgreens for $11 and they where very flimsy, hardly blocked sunlight, the mirror coating was light and would chip away, and the lens's would keep popping out. So, I went on Amazon to see if I could find a similar pair and I found this Three pack for less than what I paid for one pair, So i decided to give them a shot. They arrived early and when I opened the package they each came with there own little carrying bag witch was neat. They are very dark and block light really well! The Mirror coating is nice and dark too, and doesn't chip away. Best of all these glassless are very durable and strong, and you get 3 of em! This is a very good buy and I strongly suggest them to anyone looking for a good pair of Mirrored Aviators!"
4,Awesome buy !!,"I purchased this product and it was delivered on time and in good, strong package. The product was sent with 3 sleeve's for each of the glasses. They fit well and look good. Great Buy"
2,"Cheap price, but cheap product for sure",Glasses were flimsy and ended up broken within a couple of days. Get what you pay for though when you receive 3 pair for half the price of a cheap pair in the mall.
3,Decent,"Not the best quality, but I'm not complaining for $9 bucks. I would say they are just decent and only to be used if you lose sunglasses as much as I do!!!"
2,"Dark Lenses, Weird Looks","Two problems: the lenses are very dark, and I don't care for the looks (they just seem weird and squished). The lenses are so dark that unless it's very bright outside, I can't see the instruments in my car, or my phone, or anything. They're cheap and 8 bucks is probably worth taking a gamble on, but they still suck IMO."
3,you get what you pay for,They are cheap glasses and way to small for my head i ended up giving them to kids who think they are the sweetest glasses ever. The product was also shipped fast.
4,you get what you pay for,"not the tightest glasses i've had, but for the price they're worth it. in fact, i'm not sure if my last pair was so crappy but these seem very very dark."
4,Reasonable Quality and Great Price,"Received this within a couple of days of ordering. Pretty much everything fits together nicely and the power supply is fairly quiet. I couldn't get my new Intel m/b to boot, but it turned out to be memory probably not the power supply, so I had to open/close install/reinstall the m/b several times during trouble shooting. No issues, other than the spacers under the m/b needed to be used -- which I didn't catch the first time.Installing the mATX board was slightly tricky, but no contortions were needed. The metal case material isn't the heaviest I've seen, but does hold up to multiple installs as I mentioned. Only the one side comes off, with two thumb screws in the back holding it in-place. The front panel snaps off/on."
3,Great early blues at the right price.,Wonderful early example of an influential blues legend. Huge sampling of a talented bluesman. Not all high quality but a lesson any budding guitarist.
1,Not worth the money!,It was too flimsy! and it doesn't look anything like the picture. not even the color! I wouldn't recommend it.
3,"OK, but the Mann book is better","I had mixed feelings about this book. On the one hand, Tyler's attmepts to punch up the book by including details he could not possibly know about(see his blow by blow description of the fighting on the Sino/Soviet as seen from the perspective of a hapless Soviet lieutenant) recalls some of the worst excesses of Bob Woodward. On the other hand, Tyler does a great job of showing how internal forces within the various administrations combined to form China policy. The descriptions of Kissinger Vs Rojers and Vance Vs Berezinski are well worth reading. On the whole, however, I feel that James Mann's About Face is a better book, and covers much of the same material. If you have time read both, if not go with the Mann book."
3,"A Good, Entertaining Introduction to SinoAmerican Relations","For the casual China reader, this book is a fun read, with lots of entertaining antecdotes. It gives a good basic background on Sino-American relations. For those looking for a more thorough treatment (but still a relatively entertaining read), or for those who have a more in-depth knowledge of China, I recommend ""America's Response to China"" by Cohen."
2,A Ho-hum account,"Some interesting nuggets here and there of new information that Tyler has turned up, but otherwise most of the info here can be found elsewhere. Tyler falls into the trap that most NYT journalists fall into: that is they exaggerate in order to increase drama and tension in their narrative. This unfortunately fudges facts and leads readers who are not well-versed in the subject with possibly mistaken impressions. There are better books out there on China to read like ""About Face"" by Mann so why waste time with this one?"
2,Mixed feeling,"I view this book with mixed feeling. I felt the book is good originally, that's the only possible channel I could learn from, until one day, I heard the interview of the author from radio PBS, that gives me a feeling he is qualified as hollywood movie conductor. his account of his experience full of drama exagration but self-contradicting. The way he describes XinJiang border escape but his editor-in-chief could call him to finish a draft, about his explaination of why Beijing municipal government does not allow resident to raise big dog (I'm sure he know the offcial saying but not willing to tell, to ruin American's expected answer). In one sentence, his choice of words is tricky enough to misguide naive Americans who never take enough time to understand other countries but quick at reaching conclusions.This in turn, raises my suspicion on the way history is unfold in the book."
3,ASD-1R works as well as any of the iPod docks,"Yep, it works if you follow the Denon receiver manuals. The main advantage to the ASD-1R is that the Denon receiver remote control and manipulate your iPod; however, only music (Music, Artists, Genres, etc) can be browsed on your video/TV screen (and then it's white text on black and slow). Video/photo content can only be browsed (viewed) on the iPod screen.I have an AVR-1907 and the set up is page 38. Page 39 has instructions for playing video/photo content. You have to use ""Remote"" mode meaning you browse content by looking at the iPod.Give Denon credit, with the iPod in rapid evolution, it's hard to keep up with Apple's iPod of the year. I have a Xitel iPod dock on my other system and it works great."
1,A great disappointment...,"This is the first bad product I have seen from Denon. But it is really bad...I confirm all the problems encountered by other reviewers. The Docking Station worked for 10 minutes with a Denon 2807 and then, with no warning, stopped working and all I get now is a ""Not Connect"" message. I did everything in the instructions (i.e.: put the switch under the docking station in dock control, changed the Denon receiver setup in Ipod Assign to DVP where it was plugged, etc). I even updated the Ipod software version and did a factory reset in the receiver afterwards, only to get more ""Not Connect"" messages with 2 different Ipods...Oh! One last thing, the S-video cable really HAS little mouses marked on the ends! So they are probably using PS/2 cables as S-video cables!I will probably return it."
1,Poor quality item,The dock worked OK with my Denon 2808 for about 1 month and then just stopped working at all. The receiver can not communicate with the dock and does not get the signal from the iPod. Piece of junk.
4,Informative!,The author wrote a wonderful poem at the begining that moves one to tears. The rest of the text is queit informative especially for beginingers. Tables are abundant with proper spellings.
4,A good reference book for any Wiccan,"This book is well planned out reference book. ""Celtic Magic"" includes Celtic lore, common Spells and Rituals, common names for the God and the Goddess plus much more. This book should be used as a reference and not as a starting book. I would recomend this book for anyone serious about the Wiccan or the Celtic religions"
3,Not too bad,"A lot of people don't like Conway and say that her Celtic, Norse and Egyptian Magic books are practically the same. I have never read the other too. In fact, this is the only book I have read from Conway. I found this book helpful. I am however wary of the fact that one person could be knowledgeable enough to write about Celtic, Norse and Egyptian Magic.Nevertheless, I personally do not follow the Celtic path but most of the information in this book pertains to anyone doing magic. A lot of people give negative reviews to this book. However, I liked it and found it useful. This book is good for a beginner. Included information on: Celtic Magic, Preparing for Magic, Magical elements, Casting a Magic circle, Tools of Magic, Sabbats, Celtic History and Deities. It also has a section on Spellwork: Herb Magic, Cauldron Magic, Stone Magic, Candle Magic and a few other things. This books rituals and circles are geared more to a coven than a Solitaire."
1,This was the first book on Paganism I read,"Since reading this I have picked up several of Conway's books and I have to say this, If you come across a book written by her run, don't walk away. She has in several book given false information that could only have given by not doing the research, she also seems to suffers from the poor poor pagan syndrome in that she blames all the wrongs within paganism, on Christianity, Pagans of course have never done any any wrong, nor have they any reason to take responsibility for anything. She has a good eye for what sells but seems to not care about facts, or actually teaching. But I guess I shouldn't expect much in a world where everything seems to be sell. Even religion."
4,Good read for a beginning witch,"I have been wanting to be a witch for many years, finally I have found a group of ladies that are teaching me more, this book is a good way to learn magik. It is interesting and factual about witchcraft. I enjoyed it and it will be a go to book. A started book for sure."
2,Wicca 101,"This is basically just a Wicca 101 book, I was hoping for more, but if that's what you want, then go for it."
2,contradictory and unclear but usefull,this book has alot of tables that are usefull but it is not very clear on the trinities between certain dieties. She begins telling you that negitive magick is not good but goes on to give you information on curse and that type... I have read another one of her books and found that she puts her own spinn on history and does not approach writing with a proffessionalism that most readers require. The only reason to by this book is for its tables on dieties and magick... not a good book all together
3,A good addition to your library...,"While this should never be considered a Witch's or Wiccan's number one book, it is a good addition to the library of those that practice with a Celtic bent or flair. There is no in-depth view of anything, but a light overview of the subject is provided. For a quick look-up or as an addition, I'd recommend it, but if you can only own one book, this isn't it."
4,Good Beginners Book for those on Celtic Path,This book offers a much needed guide into the Celtic path. If you read and study it; it will peak your interest. There is an excellent guide to Celtic Gods and Goddesses in this book. There is an excellent guide to the use of herbs in this book also. I think that you will find it helpful. It tells the truth about some pagan dieties that many authors miss. The celtic rituals in the book are enjoyable and easy to do. This is a must have for anyone who is just beginning to walk the celtic path.
4,A NICE LITTLE GUIDE,"Okay, okay, i might be sentimental. I know that not everything in this book is historically correct, but it was the one that kicked me back into a spiritual life, after a 10-years break. If this nice little inexpencive guide has the same effect on other seeking people and they start do do the same thing I did: READING EVERYTHING AND GATHER MORE INFORMATION, well, than it does allready a lot! It introduced me (a European who was into celtic history years ago) into the WICCAN-Movement and revitalized my spiritually-starving brain-cells. Even if Conway writes sometimes (espescially in some of her other works) like she trips on more than her spirituallity, I enjoy her work more than that of some other ""Teenage/Business-Witch"" authorities. And btw. if you are interested in the real history: try RAVEN GRIMASSIS ""WICCAN MYSTERIES"" - just for ""the real thing"" feeling....."
1,DJ Conway Will Make Thousands Writing The Same Book...,"I agree that this is simply Norse Magic with Norse terms and deities replaced by Celtic terms and deities. The subject matter is simply too grand and of too large a scale to be handled in a dinky, badly researched book like this. Sigh."
1,A Work of Fiction,"If this book could recieve a rating of zero stars, it would. IT is absolute and utter fiction. Creative fiction, but fiction nonetheless. Folks, if you are looking for books about Celtic Paganism, SKIP THIS BOOK. The mythology is horrible, the research poor, and how can you possibly put Celtic Gods into correspondence charts?!?!?! A BAD BOOK."
1,"Misleading title, inaccurate contents","There are Celtic magical practices that have been handed down over generations--but you won't learn about them in this book. Instead, try reading books and articles about the folklore. D.J. Conway's book is about putting a veneer of Celtic deity names over basic Wiccan practices. Her ""facts"" are inaccurate; her correspondence table is both misleading and inaccurate. If you want to know about Celtic deities, refer to Miranda Green's _Gods of the Celts_."
2,"Quite misleading, actually.","As far as the research of this book goes, it is quite poor in that it contains many inaccuracies about the Celtic relgion. You see, Wicca is *not* Celtic! Sure, it derives some of it's practices/beliefs from Celtic religion but that doesn't make it Celtic nor is it regarded as being ""Celtic"" by Traditional Celtic Pagans. This book is nothing more than another book on Wicca with simply some Celtic overtones - such as a brief history on the Celts and a list of the Celtic dieties. Many people will be greatly misinformed upon reading this book so it is my opinion that one does not even bother purchasing this book if they are seriously into learning about Celtic religion and it's practices."
1,awful....,"Please pick up something different on the celts.This is just a new-age version of Wicca, wrapped in green saranwrap with shamrocks on it.Riverdance will teach you more celtic magic than this book."
2,You get what you pay for!,"This book offers a very brief and cursory look at Celtic Magick as perceived by D.J. Conway. Far from a scholastic masterpiece, but full of fun bits of information. Recommended for beginners, newbies, and those with a minimal interest in Celtic magick and lore."
1,No research done whatsoever,"At least, that's what seems to be going on. I boguht this book when I was just beginning my life as a Celtic Druid, and this book, which failed to even /spell/ Magick correctly, confused me to no end. The terms are outdated, the lore and myth is painfully butchered, and this seems to be, more than anything, the attempt to slap a Celtic label on a book of inexperienced Wicca. But, then again, I've always believed nothing can take the place of an experienced, practiced mentor in matters such as spirituality."
4,A good intro,"This is a good intro for people interested in the Craft for a religion or just curious. There is a lot of basic information and a good list of Dieties, and other useful spell information. I recommend it highly for jumping of point in exploring your own spiritual path."
1,Wrong genre,"DJ Conway should have been a fiction writer. Basically, all her books that I've ever read are fiction.How does it help the Pagan community at all to perpetuate these romanticized fantasies as history? It makes us look like idiots to the rest of the world, and basically authors like Conway are doing the exact thing they accuse Christians of doing-- they have an agenda (selling books) and are lying to people to suck them in.It's downright dispicable. And she puts the same stuff in her books over and over again; this repurposed material is just a rip-off."
2,beginners only,"There are many problems with this book, starting with the fact that the magic system presented, while effective enough, isn't really Celtic at all, more of a basic Wiccan/Ceremonial system. However, if one wants to learn this there are better books out there to do so. The tables of correspondances are handy enough and are practically the only reason to recommend this book, but again, there are better sources with more in-depth knowledge. This book would be great for a beginner, but advanced practitioners are advised to look elsewhere."
2,"This book has VERY, VERY few redeeming qualities","I cannot recommend this book as anything other than a cheap read to pass the time. The information in it is grossly inaccurate and on the whole a farce. It seems that the author would rather compare the, in reality almost non-existent historically, relationship between Wicca and Celtic pagan worship. There is very little information on spellwriting/crafting, and relatively little talk of the Druidic lifestyle. This book will do little more than steer a beginning Celtic pagan or Bard in the wrong direction."
3,eh...could be done better....,"I grew up learning Celtic mythology and different types of Cetlic Magick. This book confused me at times, and the rituals are a little odd. Conway makes Celtic mythology sound like it's all about PEOPLE. I think I read one or two things about the Faerie Kingdom...the tables and encyclopedia of Gods and Goddesses was good though..."
4,GREAT POCKET REFERENCE,THIS MAY NOT BE THE MOST DETAILED BOOK EVER WRITTEN BUT IT IS A PERFECT HANDY POCKET GUIDE TO PRACTICAL MAGIC--I REFER BACK TO THIS BOOK ENDLESSLY WHEN I AM LOOKING FOR SOMETHING QUICK--GREAT INCESENCE REFERENCE--QUICK CONCISE APPROACH TO MAGIC
3,A Mediocre Book,"This book wasn't very well researched, however I found the herb magick to be very useful. I have been into Celtic mythology, culture, and Magick for years, and this book did not really tell me anything new. An OK book for beginners"
3,good yet too broad needed to be more precise,"This was a helpful book for beginers.But it needed to be a little more precise. The author needed to make it clear that Celtic and Wican magicks are almost the same. Also, to be extremely careful in their practices."
3,ok give her a break,"Conway has received a lot of criticism on her books from the stricter practitioners out there. Notice that the people who liked this book usually also said that it was their first book (it wasn't mine but it gave me a couple of ideas). I would recommend this book to a beginner in magic who thinks they want to go Wiccan but also feels they want to have a Celtic flavor to their practice.No, you shouldn't read only this book and think you have celtic mythology down pat but you should NEVER read any one book on magic or Celtic history... let's say it togeteher... ""perspective"". I don't think Conway was trying to give you the be-all end-all book on Celtic Magic.So if you're an aspiring witch who wants to put a Celtic spin on your next circle casting get this book and a couple of others and have fun. If you want an authentic no holds barred 100% Celtic experience, get on a plane to teh British Isles."
1,Oy,This book is almost the same old stuff from Norse Magick with the obvious exceptions.....it seems like she cranked out these two books at the same time.....Boring and the same old stuff
2,Interesting but historically inaccurate,"Okay. This book has come in for a lot of criticism here, and a lot of it's justified.However, this was the book that set me on the pagan path, and as such I guess I feel a little sentimental about it.The history is bad. Okay. That's something you're likely to find in most books on paganism these days, and at least it's vague enough to make people (such as myself) read up on it and learn the ""truth,"" so to speak.I thought the correspondence tables were quite nice, even if there's next to no information on too many of the deities listed there aside from the mention of their names.The rituals are the high point of the book for me. Even if they don't quite suit your personal practice, I'd recommend a look at them for ideas on how to write your own.All in all, a book of limited use, but it makes for a nice read anyway."
1,inaccurate and misleading,"Having been born and bred in Wales and being Celtic through and through, this book is totally inaccurate and misleading. It dwells more on Wicca rather than Celtic Paganism, if you want to write a book on Wicca, write a book about wicca, and leave Celtic Magic to those who actually practice it."
2,Not Up To Llewellyn's Standards,"I have ready many good books published by Llewellyn, This is not one of them. This book is not a good reference on Celtic ways. The myths are very touch and go, and written in a way that wold be confusing to someone not familiar with them, and if your familiar you won't learn anything. The table of correspondences is not a druid one, but a modern one having nothing to do with tradition, one fact evident of this is that aluminum which is named in the table was not invented for centuries later. Book is worth reading, but not entirely true, take everything with a grain of salt. I did enjoy the section on the Ogham Alphabet, but it alone is not worth ordering this book considering much more in-depth coverage of it is available. I would say if you are new to Celtic ways, and don't plan to do much other reading on it, get it, otherwise don't waste your time."
5,"""The Babies"" is beautiful and perpetually born.","Mark creates space by creating borders--what is beyond moves closer, and what is close moves far away. Each poem in ""The Babies"" is new language; each is an utterance that is somehow finished exactly at the moment of its conception, so that the reader feels as though there is no other way to say what has been said. The poems are inevitable; they are crystalized; they are fierce and soft."
2,Don't bank on these values of equipment,"The books format is simple and easy to read, however, the values presented are not current to the used farm equipment market and do not represent an accurate guide to buy or sell farm machinery from. I found the Official Farm Equipment Guide published by IRON Solutions the company that produces the value guides for banks, dealers, auction & insurance companies the best resource. It not only provides accurate values, but serial number and year details. IRON Solutions is the company that is the only official source of collecting and distributing used farm machinery pricing data for the industry in North America. This book has saved me money!"
2,Too Historical!,"The book devoted too much of its pages to the breeding history of the Scottish Terrier, not enough to the caring and maintenance of the breed. Also, there were no color pictures which I hated and no mention of the dog's personality traits etc. This book may be alright for Professional Breeders but in my personal opinion it's TOO EXPENSIVE a book for what it is. I was disappointed."
1,There Are Far Better Books,"This book was a big disappointment. Instead of a useful overview of the Scottish Terrier breed; it's history, temperment, health and so on the book focussed too much on lineages, particularly related to the author's own dogs. It seemed cobbled together from unrelated sources and does not appear well researched or thought out. Primarily, I suspect it is simply an advertisement for the author's own kennel in order to advance her in the dog show world. Muriel Lee's book on Scotties or even good old Dorothy Casperz various books are far better than this one which is definitely not worth the money."
1,Too many pages devoted to lineage,"The book is 242 pages in length and the first 143 pages contain the different breeders (kennels.) I found the reading to be very difficult. However, I did see the names of two kennels my Scottie is descended from. I thought the book would contain more information on the history of the Scottie. There are a few pages devoted to the history of the Scottie though. I think the book would be great for breeders and those who show Scotties. For you people out there who want to learn more about your Scottie as a pet, this book is not for you."
2,"Good content, but unprofessional publishing","I can disagree about the ease of understanding and the knowledge of Stephen Robbins, but Prentice Hall, the publisher of this book, has blown it. This book is filled with typos and misspellings.For a $120+ book, I would hope they would put it in front of a copy editor."
5,Made me Sing,"Wow! Just wow! My 13-year-old daughter suggested that I read TWS and boy am I glad I did! Never in a zillion years did I think a book would be comparable to The Hobbit for world building, character likability, humor and fast-paced action. The Wind Singer really sizzles. There is something about the English that makes them such wholly enchanting narrators. Grab it and go."
5,Great books all around,"My ten year old had just started to read book one, and he is already half way through. He said it is really interesting. We got him book two and three also. So he can't wait to read all of them. He also said that it is weired so far, but nice and keeps him want to know more."
4,Second best,Great book. Lots of detail and an exciting plot. Not as good as the second book in the trilogy....so the second best. Definitely worth reading.
5,good can come from evil,"Nowadays many books for children, like Harry Potter or the Golden Compass books, focus on societies or people that are wholly good or bad, and act accordingly. What captured me about this trilogy was the concept that oppressive societies, slavery, and other cruelties can be the catalyst for goodness, artistic beauty, and personal growth and understanding. Although this is closer to reality, it is refreshingly painted in an unambiguous, stark style that is compelling without being overpowering. The children are clever and confront challenges with creative, bold action. A wonderful story with great inspiration hidden under the edges. Recommended for kids in 6th grade or so."
5,infectious and inspiring music you MUST OWN,"SOJA has been playing in the background of my life for two years now. sad to say, after listening to peace in a time of war non-stop for so long, its hard for me to turn to anything else reggae... YES even marley. this is no knock on the roots greats believe me. SOJA is just THAT GOOD. jacobs voice is haunting and beautiful, backed up by great rythm and lines from the band this cd will stay in your player or ipod on repeat. my brother who isnt more than a passive reggae fan (marley, the occasional toots or tosh) after hearing me play the Soldiers now is hooked as well. these guys will be known as one of the american reggae greats.. (along and above groundation believe me) CANT MISS SONGS!! ""true love"", ""rasta courage"", ""brothers and sisters"" , ""jah love"", ""peace in a time of war"" the entire disc is unreal... check out the latest ""Get Wiser"" but not before ""Peace""............... SOJA!"
5,"Amazing Reggae, period!!!","SOJA is one of the greatest reggae bands I've heard in a long time and I've been listening to them since I was in High School back in 03-ish. Other great bands to listen to are: Katchafire (New Zealand), The Green (Hawai'i), Ooklah The Moc (Hawai'i), Rebelution (Cali), Groundation (?), Pepper (Hawai'i), Slightly Stoopid (Cali)... Spread reggae music and let people hear/feel it. Enjoy."
1,"Mine exploded, too!",My cobalt blue Pyrex baking dish exploded into a million little peices. I heard they have changed their process so the Pyrex name doesn't mean diddly any more. Stay away from this dangerous product! Buy good Pyrex at garage sales!
4,"Excellent, although all pieces should come with lids!","Excellent, although all pieces should come with lids!"
1,Warning!!,"I have owned two pieces of Pyrex Cobalt blue cooking dishes and both have exploded in the oven. I bought one piece two years ago and it exploded after a month while making Baked Ziti. I bought another piece this year from a different store and it exploded the first time I used it in the oven.I studied to be a chef, use them under normal conditions and have never seen anything like this beforeThe sides of the dish blew out, there were shards of glass on top of the food, the bottom broke into fifty or more pieces. If I had opened the oven as it exploded chances are I would have been injured.I haven't had this problem with any other pyrex dishes, just the blue dishes. Bottom line is two dishes, to dinners ruined, its not worth it to me to buy another."
1,Me Too!,"My cobalt pyrex baking dish, too, exploded in the oven, today while cooking a normal dinner. Do not use cobalt pyrex dishes. I have never heard of a clear dish doing this but see that many reviewers have had this happen with the cobalt."
1,Exploded in the oven,"While baking a basic brownie dish in the oven, my pyrex colbalt blue 9 x 13 pan exploded into 1000 little pieces in the oven. Nothing abnormal was done regarding temperature, greasing or any other questionable baking temperature changes. After reading others' comments I see I am not alone. Do not buy the tinted glass Pyrex, only the clear (never had a problem with clear)."
1,Very unhappy and extremely mad,"I have had the exact same experience with the purple pyrex as ""slevena"" did. I have never experienced such crap before. They really need to fix this problem. I would not reccommend this or any similar products, it will probably ruin a mean in less than 1 year."
4,Worth its weight,"Yes, fine set of bakeware, out of the 5, I have used one on many occassion, and honestly, be it cake, or meat, you bake and you clean, no fuss, no stress, very easy to clean and I would recommend it to any kitchen."
4,Growing on me,Thessaly is growing on me as a character. It would be interesting to see some stories from her past
4,Rachel Gibson,"This author cracks me up. I like that most of the stories she writes are light hearted. They're what I call ""totally fluff"", but they're a good (old Calgon commercial) take-me-away read."
2,Okay,This book had much more wear and tear than I was expecting. The spine is damaged and there is some water damaged.
3,Good but long,Its a bit long to get to the actually story but i enjoyed reading & i love the dog story its very cute
5,thrilling,I just can't get enough of Rachel Gibson books. I have read almost all of them and keep looking for new ones to come out.
3,It was pretty good but fizzled near the end,"I enjoyed Gibson having a female lead who showed her vulnerabilities and needed the male. It was refreshing not to have Miss Independance like in every other romance novel that's afraid to be that stereotypical damsel in distress. That having been said, I enjoyed the story and the time they spent alone on the yacht, but then when they got back home I just didn't see what was actually keeping them apart..his top secret job?It wasn't the best by Rachel Gibson, but it's a fun, light read."
4,grows on you,"At first, this book turned me off because I felt the ""forced together"" part of it was too contrived and negative. However, the strength of Gibson's character development and writing in general helped this story gain speed. I felt these were mature characters with real issues. The best part is that I've actually thought about it afterwards (there's a shocker!). All said and done: it's a lot better than most in the genre out there."
3,Well-written but not a comedy,"I've read all Rachel Gibson's books, and I can clearly say the others were comedies. But this book came off more like light drama for me than a comedy. That will be fine for people who prefer drama, and see anything that isn't full of angst as ""comedy."" However, if you are, lik me, used to Gibson's previous books, which are really funny, the comparison to what she usually does makes this book fall short. If it were her first book, I might give it 4 stars. Unfortunately for her, she has set up reader expectations, especially mine, that she will actually write comedy.In addition, I also don't personally enjoy books where the hero is wounded/hurt and is still feeling hot for the heroine, as in this one. I just don't believe it. Even if he is a former SEAL (and supposedly able to eat nails for breakfast), as this hero is."
2,Lola Carlyle misses the mark....,"I'll admit that I was disappointed and didn't finish the book. Lola is a ditz, but not a funny ditz. ... This book just went no where. But I did like the dog."
2,Lola Carlyle Reveals What?,"I got ""Lola Carlyle Reveals All"" based on the reviews that that I had read and I have to say that I only got half though it before I gave up (something that I rarely do.) I was very disappointed in the book. This book couldn't not hold my interest, the only reason that I gave it two stars was that I found Lola to a believable character where her weight issues were concerned. But otherwise ""Lola Carlye Reveals All"" was a big disappointment."
1,Lola Carlyle Reveals All...but nothing of Gibson's Talent,"This weekend, I plopped down on the couch with a pint of Ben and Jerry's New York Super Fudge Chunk and my long awaited copy of LCRA...and boy was I disappointed! (Not with the B&J, of course.;)) I was expecting a great, quirky, smart heroine, not the bland, silly heroine Lola turns out to be. What sexy bra and thong model would get seriously upset about some naked pictures on the 'net?...and would a person really get someone to pay $25 to see them? No. When Lola realizes a stranger is on the boat, why didn't she pick up her cell phone instead of a flare gun? It is all so far-fetched, and ultimately, disappointing. Hopefully, Gibson's next book will showcase her obvious talent revealed in Truly, Madly Yours and True Confessions, because it certainly isn't revealed here."
3,Not her best,"Being a huge fan of Ms Gibson, I felt this was a lukewarm story however it was a new type of storyline for Rachel. So cudos for the attempt but I won't read it again. Unless she doesn't write a new book soon. Cause then I will have to re-read all her books while I wait. Darnit!"
4,A GOOD SUMMER READ,"Frankly, I liked this book better than TRUE CONFESSIONS, although maybe not as well as her first two books. We have all the elements here - a hunky, macho man and a beautiful, fiesty woman. Personally, I think the book could have done without the dog, but maybe that's because I'm a cat person. With sparks flying in the love department and bullets, too, it's an enjoyable adventure. You might also want to check out LAUREN BACH's new book, SLOW HANDS or GLENNA McREYNOLDS' RIVER OF EDEN."
4,Sexy!,"It sizzles and fueled my dreams for the night that it took me to read it. If you are looking for a quick read that invited laughter and heat, pick up LOLA CARLYLE REVEALS ALL."
2,no good,"Okay guys.Come one now. I know that the romance novels are no brainer and we read them for fun and a moment of dreaming.Her first book was wonderful and I couldn't wait for her next one.But ever since then I have been disappointed. The end is rushed and has NO ONE noticed all the grammtical errors in the book? Again to me a sign that todays authors are more into throwing these books out at a fast speed rather than take good care of their work and take pride in it.Waste of money. Definately.Sorry Mrs. Gibson, but the last books have been a big let down.And to anyone who wants to read one of her books and have a good time, read her very first one.She shows her talent and skills there and it is so much fun to read it.This one is a big let down. I do give her credit for doing a great deal of research and using acurate facts in her story.Sorry. It is a simple book."
2,Bit of a Disappointment,What a disappointing book from a good author. I read other books by this author (tangled up in you & not in the mood for love) and enjoyed those better.
2,Potential spoilers!,"This book really blew it for me when Lola took the time to pluck her eyebrows and apply makeup while on a deserted island. You've got to be kidding me. And then not too long after that scene, she complains because Max makes her leave behind her toothbrush and designer wallet to hide their identity from the drug lords. Was this supposed to be funny? It wouldn't be so bad if Max didn't go on and on about how 'brave' she was. Please. Brave and courgous she was not. Lola Carlyle didn't do anything more special then the rest of us would've done in that situation. For crying out loud she hyperventilated while escaping. Of all times.*SPOILER* Yes she did give Max a chance at a relationship. Knowing that he could leave at any time and may never return. So when the time comes are we supposed to have pity for her when she leaves him and tells him she can't be with him? She knew this all along. Yes it's what makes the love story in this book. But I wished it wasn't done this way."
2,Disappointed,I was excited to read this book because it sounded fabulous but was filled with every romance cliche ever written. Lola had NO personality. It seemed like they fell for each other too fast and for no apparent reason other than they both looked really good. It seemed like she only like him because he saved her from peril (peril which he put her in.)I couldn't finish this book. I just skipped to the end to see what happened.
5,love this thing,i love it i work out on it every day i feel gr8 im 270pd it holds me jus fine i got mines for $50 on craigslist so i save $600 but i do and will say this is a total work out get in shape summer time is a coiming
2,Not so great,I purchased this after many research hours. Everyone seemed to like it. And I guess I would to BUT.. It doesnt hold my weight! I weigh 235. The board flexes and rubs. Therefore I can not do any exercises with it! The weight limit says it is 250. But it is untrue. So bummed. I was looking forward to this. Guess Im joing the gym. After I lose 15 pounds. I will come back to it!
4,"An Expert's Book on Ancient China 3,000 Years Ago","If you want to really know about the earliest Chinese writing during the Shang Dynasty (1200-1045 BC), then this book is a must read for you. It is NOT for the casual reader, but rather is another book from an author who is perhaps the leading expert on translating and understanding ancient Chinese characters. They say that the truth is in the details and if so, then this scholarly book by Dr. Keightly is certainly the truth about life in early China. On a personal note, I have used this book to help me translate some of the early Chinese writing on oracle bones, jade, and bronze Chinese artifacts in my collection. This short book of only 200 pages contains an extensive Bibliography for those experts who what to dive even further into the Shang Community."
1,Not a Great Rack,"The item is overpriced and should be included with the purchase of every Orion Dob. However, this item has absolutely no reflection on the quality company that Orion actually is. The rack also does not work with larger EP's such as hyperions which is a bummer."
4,Classic angst,"This is a true classic angstalbum in the vein of Placebo, The Cure, Radiohead, Suede and Joy Division. If you like these artists, you would do yourself a favour and check Strangelove out."
1,a disapointment,"Of all the terrific Betty Grable films I don't understand how this one made it to dvd. I just thought the story was dull and the dvd quality wasn't the greatest. I wish they would put I Wake up Screaming, The Dolly Sisters and Mother Wore Tights on dvd."
3,Pretty but fragile,"This bracelet is pretty, but you have to be very careful wearing it. The first time I wore it I found 4 charms that had fallen off at various places throughout the day. Who knows how many I really lost."
2,Did not Fit,"This Product did not Fit my Guitar. Just didn't work out for me, the color is good seems like it would have been pretty cool but no use...."
5,Great music by a great performer,"This is why I like Amazon, you can get older music that you may have listened to when you were younger. I bought 4 Carman CDs this time and love all of them. God Bless."
5,Christmas gift,"I gave these Pyrex bowls with lids to my daughter-in-law for Christmas after noticing she didn't have mixing bowls. She often takes salads to block parties, so I wanted something attractive and with lids. She uses them regularly. They were exactly as advertised and arrived in a timely fashion."
5,A great set for the price- AND Made In the USA!,"I actually got the bigger set which was a fantastic bargain at $19.99 with free shipping and no tax. And no toxins from plastic AND Made in the USA. What a feel-good purchase it was! Now as stated in some reviews, the plastic lids can be hard to get on but if you run them under hot water first.....they'll snap right on with no problem."
5,Perfect,"Great sizes. Nice texture to the bowls, making them simple yet attractive for serving or storing. Lids fit well, and smooth insides make for easy cleaning."
1,Not good enough!,"The round amethyst 4 prong earrings cost too much at half the price. The stones were not translucent but solid (unlike the photo), very poor example of amethyst. The only real value was in the 14K mounting, not enough to justify the price(Gold Box or not). Amazon standards are normally not that low."
1,Not a romance!,"Very disappointing book -- no romance to speak of (although there is sex) -- after reading it, I cared little about the characters. Author threw in some disgusting torture scenes - all in all a very bad start to a new series. Not a romance - not a suspense thriller -"
4,Cheers for Bombshell Line,I love reading fast-paced action adventures with strong female leads. Great that Silhouette has this new Bombshell line. I look forward to more adventures with Nova and hopefully her sexy partner Joe next time around.
1,Not what I expected,"Unfortunately, before I bought the book there werent't many honest reviews about this book. I should never have bought it. I have morals and it disgusted me when Nova got involded with a married man. It was going well until I got to the part where they sleept together. I burned the book. The back cover doesn't even tell you much either which I think was deceitfull. I love woman in action. I love romance book. This book. . . total dissapointment. . ."
4,"A gritty, fast-paced thriller!","I've been anticipating the arrival of Silhouette's new Bombshell line, and CODE NAME: DOVE is all I expected from this new single title line for a publisher usually synonymous with romance.Let me warn romance readers that CODE NAME: DOVE is not a romance. It's a story about a stong woman who saves the day. And the heroine, Nova Blair, is a perfect example of the Bombshell heroine.The strength of Ms. Leon's writing lies in the creations of very complex main characters and a fast-paced plot that is gritty and engrossing. I look forward to more stories with Nova and her partner, Joe.A romance reader for years, I've been looking for something exciting and different. CODE NAME: DOVE is just that!Traditional romance readers may find this story to be a bit edgy for their taste, but for the readers looking for a thrilling read, CODE NAME: DOVE is perfect for you!"
3,Short glimpse into the racial tensions of the early 1970's,"This book is more like a novella than a full-fledged novel. It had potential to blossom out into something larger, but instead represented a compact look into the social tensions of the Vietnam era.There was a lot of buildup with the bomb going home with an unsuspecting family. However, the ending was abrupt without the kind of tension the rest of the book set up.According to the cover, this book was supposed to be made into a movie. I guess I'll take a look for it and see how this was portrayed on screen."
3,Baker's Secret 3-Piece Pizza Stone Set,The surface is too small. Only enough surface area to make a pizza for 2 people. You also must cook on the bottom self of the oven to prevent the crust from burning. You can get a pizza stone at WalMart for $6.
1,Disorganized and out of date,"There is a lot of information in this book, just not the the most up to date and useful information. The text although voluminous rambles a lot. Important information like length of hikes into fishing areas and time required is missing in many casese. Most streams, lakes, and trails that are mentioned are not shown on the very skimpy maps used. Most of the information is a decade out of date--the author is constantly referring to what the fishing may be like by the mid-1990s which according to my calendar was a decade ago. I was very disappointed with this book and had I seen it in a book store it would have remained there. The real downside is that it's the only flyfishing book on Yosemite that I could find."
3,not too bad,I have had to read this book for the English class and I must say that it is not bad. For me it was not easy to understand and so I was tired to read it. But I think that it was a good choice to read this book in class because you can learn much about the Revolution in Russia but also a lot about tyranny.
5,CLASSIC!,A great video in great condition! The program is as entertaining today as when I saw it when I was young. I've already watched it multiple times.
5,X-Men:Pryde of the X-Men review,"The animation is kind-of cool & nice-looking. The storyline is solid and makes sences. The fight scences are slow but still fun to watch.Some of the voice actiing is not great but pretty good. The only not-so-good thing about this show in my mind at least are the voices of Kitty Pryde & Toad which both tick me off. other then that,it is still a good tape to watch. I give this video a 9 out of 10."
3,The original X-Men cartoon,"I first saw this when I was 6 and it started a life long love of X-Men. It's pretty cheesey in comparison to the newer X-Men cartoons, but it's still pretty neat. The various characters are potrayed more acurately than on the newer cartoons. This video is pretty short (roughly half an hour) but it's still something worth picking up if you're an X-Men fan"
2,How did they get away with this?!?,"This was Marvel's first attempt to translate the best-selling comic book into the animated format. What they came up with was a ham-hocked tale based solely on characters, events, and costume designs pulled directly from the Konami arcade game (with the exception of Toad, who didn't deserve to be in the game, anyway). It's enough to make the (to quote Stan ""The Man"" Lee) ""true believers"" shudder at the prospect of their beloved mutants being reduced to one-dimensional caricatures. However, for any X-Men completists or collectors of rare videos, this is one for the shelves."
2,"They are OK, but I wanted clear fronts","All the other colored cases I've had before had a clear front, and colored back. These have a white back, and a colored front. To me, that is just plain stupid. It obscures the front of the CD. If that doesn't matter to you, then these are as good and any other cheap jewel case."
4,Johnny Depp: Bad Boy or Mr. Nice Guy?,"I am a fan of Johnny Depp and have decided to read this autobiography by Brian J. Robb. It is a great little book that focuses on Johnny's career rather than childhood and personal life. If you want to know all about his movies and why he chose to star in them, this is the book for you. Although mainly career orientated, the book does tell about his temper tantrums, profilic girlfreinds, Winona Ryder and Kate Moss and of his great heart. Quite a few nice black and white photos, mainly of his movies, lots of quotes and gives out a feeling that Johnny Depp is a sweet, family man with a big heart trapped in a body of a bad boy who throws temper tantrums and has a zest for kooky movies. Overall, I reallu liked it! Only 158 pages, a lot of them pictures, yet the novel is detailed."
5,Revised and updated,"Perfectly timed for the latest 'Pirates of the Caribbean' blockbuster film is Johnny Depp: A Modern Rebel: a biography of the quirky actor whose good looks and lively adventures hide a rebellious young man whose drug-filled adolescence seemed unlikely to create a celebrity. From his volatile relationships and life to his evolving career and interest in independent, adventure-laden roles, is Johnny Depp: A Modern Rebel is revised and updated and comes packed with black and white and color photos.Diane C.

5,Beautiful!,"Fantastic recording! Dave Cousins' usual thoughtful, cerebral lyrics, and melodies that stick in your head, and exceptional musicianship from the Blue Angel Orchestra (Ian Cutler, Chas Cronk, Miller Anderson, Chris Hunt)... a very diverse collection of songs, from the fiddle-flavored rock of ""Never Take Sweets From A Stranger,"" to the folky ""Skip To My Lou"" to the 1930s feel of ""Wish You Were Here,"" plus a rocking blues number and some beautiful, sweet ballads. Shame there are no samples on Amazon, but if you find Dave Cousins on MySpace (www.myspace.com/davecousinsuk) you can listen to a few tracks. bet you'll find yourself singing ""Calling Out My Name"" tomorrow!"
3,"uneven, bitter sweet offering","My title to this pretty well sums up my thoughts on this 2007 Dave Cousins effort.I find the lyrics often bland, at times twee, occasionally arcane, often tart, though not as nasty as, say, Roger Waters became.The sound is occasionally muddy. Miller Anderson's guitar is however typically top notch, without being flashy. The percussion plods.( I might say that the percussion of even such a worthy as Carl Palmer can be pedestrian...for example the ""splat splat splat"" on ""Asia live in Moscow"")(the one with Pat Thrall)The violin is a nice touch, but the female harmonies are mixed well back, and as Cousins voice can be monotonous in its gravelly way, this is a problem.This is typically Cousins, overall, but there are welcome hints of old Fairport, or even Steeleye Span sound palettes.A couple of brief forays into rockier, and even Bluesy styles throw some interest into a lack-luster album.Old Geezers having a go, but without the old magic.Disappointing."
5,Excellent compilation of sacred hymns,"The BYU Singers bring their beautifully precise sound to a number of loved hymns, including excellent arrangements of ""A Poor Wayfaring Man of Grief"" and ""Peace Like a River""."
4,Very good overview both for beginning and studying IH,"I used an earlier edition of this book in graduate school and now used this book in my studies for the CIH exam. Great overview, written in plain language. Some calculation information is also included."
4,Good condition,"The product arrived in relatively good condition, with only a few nicks on the front and back cover. I do wish I would have known just how large the book was, though."
3,Fundamentals of Industrial Hygiene Fifth Edition,"The book is very thorough and makes a good field technical manual, but is very hard to read, in the sense that it is a dry, textbook-type, regulation-similar read. I would not read it if I didn't have to and as a desk manual it's not quite as good as just a OSHA guide. So, not bad, okay, read because I have to, but not a choice book."
4,"Good cases, just wish they came with a front sheet for writing songs/files/etc.","These are good cases. So far I haven't had problems with cracking & breaking, or failure to close properly.My one piece of feedback would be that it is handy to have a cover with lines to write tracks, file names, etc., or even just to use to cut out one's own cover design."
4,good,"product came on time and was as expected except that it was not packaged as a whole, looked like they were taken from a larger package and taped together. Top one was broken but was still usuable"
1,Do Not Purchase This Item!,"I cannot believe that this product carries the Fellowes brand name. Of the 25 Slim Jewel Cases that come in the package, only 10 of them are usable. The rest of them were significantly cracked or outright broken to the point where the front disconnects from the back. Every one of them has some sort of scratch on it.WARNING: Do not purchase this product. If you do, then do so at your own risk. You cannot say that you were not warned.The plastic feels very flimsy, and there is no amount of packaging that could possible protect the flimsy, tightly packed product in the shrink wrap. Of all of the items that I have ever purchased on Amazon, this is the first time that I have ever been disappointed with the quality of the product.If I could give the Fellowes Slim Jewel Case a zero score, then I would. A negative number would be a more accurate indication of what this product accurately deserves. I cannot say it strongly enough: Do not, not, not buy this product."
4,Very slight disappointment,"While I was viewing this as an art book and not a book of cartoons, I was still rather saddened that many cartoons from the 1950s and 1960s still have not been released. I loved seeing the Sunday color cartoons that UPS and Mr. Schulz did not see fit releasing. I loved them all (particularly Charlie Brown and Shermy building the clubhouse that they would be excluded from!). Also, being photographs or such, it was difficult seeing the tiny boxes without good reading glasses.HOWEVER, this is indeed a good buy. My heart as well as my eyes captured every page over and over again. This is a must buy book.One question: Is it Jean Schulz or Jeanne Schulz??"
2,Impressive color printing but dissapointing presentation.,"First of all, I'm reviewing this book, not the Peanuts comic strip. I love the strip; that's why I bought the book.And, the pictures of early historical ""pre-Peanuts"" and ""proto-Peanuts"" stuff are great.My low rating is based on how all the impressive color printing was put to use.Why do I need enlargements of color newspaper strips so huge I can see all the color dots? What's the point? It would be different if they were blow-ups of the original inked art.Then there is the multitude of early Peanuts strips that are printed so small that they are hard to read for an extended period of time.I wish the newspaper printing enlargements weren't there, and that the space had been used to print the old daily strips just a little larger.I looked at the historical stuff in the book for about half-an-hour, but have never looked at this book since."
5,Great Book about one of my heroes.,"One of my favorite books that I own is Peanuts: the art of Charles Schultz. Its rich, close-up photography of the yellowing newsprint pages are so warm and inviting. It also includes a biography, rare memorabilia, sketches by Shultz as well as images of the original inked artwork from the strip. Even though I've had the book for a few years now, I never get tired of immersing myself in the evolution of Shultz's talent and the Peanuts characters.There was a time in my life when I very much wanted to be a syndicated comic strip artist. Occasionally my fancies take me down that path even now and usually it's encounters with this book that trigger such wanderings."
5,Keep the lights on while watching this one!,"I didn't know much about the mysterious, unsolved murders of Villisca before viewing this unique documentary. The producers have nearly unraveled the mystery decades later...or did they? It truly is a great mystery for the ages. What a great story! Told with just the right amount of Midwestern flavor of the era and with intriguing images and interviews, this will leave you on the edge of your seat. Bravo!"
5,Can a murder be solved after 90 years?,"This film is a documentary focusing on the June 1912 Villisca, Iowa axe murders that killed eight people. The movie tells the story of the crime itself, the suspects, the attempts at solving the crime and the lasting effects this heinous act had on the small town of Villisca. Townspeople, criminal experts and Villisca ""buffs"" are interviewed. Suspects are presented and theories given, but the mystery goes on....An enjoyable movie for crime buffs and historians - very well presented. You don't have to know about the crime in advance to understand and enjoy the movie. Since it is a documentary, it is full of still photos, but nothing squeamish like the subject might suggest.The DVD is chock full of goodies, including two sets of commentaries, one by Dr. Ed Epperly, Villisca crime expert, who has been researching the case for 50 years, and another by the filmmakers themselves. Great stuff"
4,Worked as advertised,"Unlike the other reviewers, I've had no problems at all. It plugged into my Denon 2807 with the included cable and worked just fine. Granted, I did have to refer to the original instructions from the receiver (and remember to both select the iPod function, enable an input source, and finally to turn enable Video on the iPod itself).The only real failing of the design is that you have to switch ""mode"" to get into the video section of your iPod (assuming it is a video iPod). Once there, you can't watch the menu on your monitor, only on the iPod's screen itself."
1,Stereo-RCA Male Cable,"Get yourself a3.5mm to Stereo-RCA Male Cable - 12 ft., available in 3ft or 6ft also, and then plug your ipod into a wall socket with your usb cable for a fraction of the price."
1,Terrible - Do not buy,"I bought this expecting a nice interface between my ipod and the Denon A/V. It was terrbily sluggish, it would work for one or two songs and then shut down. I am pretty saavy when it comes to computers and A/V equipment and I can tell you this is not a good product. Even if it functioned correctly the interface has blotching numbers and letters that look like it is from 1980.I ended up returning it."
1,DOES NOT WORK - 2 times service -,"Bought the Deno ASD 1RBK Dock statio, dont work, Sent for service TWICE - came back as before. Service is non existing.. do not buy this product."
3,Navigation functionality needs improvement,"I was fortunate to have successfully installed the dock with very little problems. I will say that Denon does not make their reference manuals the most user friendly.My biggest issue is the navigation - I did have the playlists appear on my TV and like some of the other reviews, have a lot of music on my iPod leading to scrolling forever just to get to the composer or album.There is no alpha jump or page jump which is unfortunate and I have to click down each entry. I guess I can do a workaround by creating a playlists that I know I will use more often and have them appear at the top.I bought this primarily because I just had purchased a Denon receiver and wanted the seamless integration - this dock did deliver but functionality could be more convenient."
2,DON'T BUY UNLESS YOUR DENON RECEIVER HAS AN IPOD DOCK CONTROL PORT,"Don't buy this unless your stereo receiver system has a designated Ipod dock port. I have the Denon AVR 2105, and I was unable to control the Ipod using the stereo receiver's remote. The Ipod did, however, play properly and sounded really good on the stereo system. Don't buy this unless you are content with manually operating the Ipod to change songs, etc."
1,AVR2807 compatibility problem...,We attempted hooking up two ASD-3Ns to two different AVR2807s and neither would work. The first one worked for a short period intermittently and then stopped producing audio and video (aside from a NOT CONNECTED prompt) and the second one didn't work at all.We've installed 100s of docks and know all of the tricks and bottom line...there is a problem with the earlier generation of AVR2807s and this dock. Denon knows nothing about it.We also tried a Marantz IS201 dock on this receiver and it wouldn't pass video. When you would press the menu on the IPOD and then menu on the receiver you would then get the IPOD menu underlaid with the Denon menu. This product works flawlessly on other Denon receivers. It seems that the upconversion on the AVR 2807 has a problem with S-Video. It could be a problem with TBC with 480i sources (because the menu defeats the upconversion and then the menu works fine).
3,"Denon Dock Black, Average to Above Average","I am an audiophile who also likes the convenience of having listening to my Ipod in my office. I have a Audio Technica W1000 headphone and Little Dot II tube amp hooked up to the Denon Ipod Dock and at first, I admit, it sounded worse than my original Ipod-Little Dot amp setup. Sound was loud and harsh and didn't have the warmth that my previous setup had. I got the deck mostly so I can see the songs without having to move my Ipod every time. I just wanted to have the same quality of sound with more convenience. I know few of you probably care about sound quality as much as I do but this is for the few that cares. I worked it out by removing something else from my PS Audio Ultimate Outlet and plugged both my amp and my dock into it. It now works about as well as when the Ipod was directly plugged into the amp."
5,Works well with my iPod Video and Denon 2807,"Plugged it in, set it up in the Denon 2807 menu, and it worked. Able to display Video on my TV and sound through the speakers attached to my receiver."
3,A perfect assortment,"I got a set of these to replace essential kitchen items lost in a move. I was really pleased with the assortment:The three sizes of Pyrex measures are useful--the metric marks are easy to read, too.The glass bowls are good for mixing and also can go in the microwave. What was pleasing were the litte extras included-- a dough scraper, a set of measuring spoons that snap together and an egg separator that snaps onto the side of a cup."
4,Best Map in Town,"This map is easy to use and has many wonderful attributes. It covers the entire St. Louis area and vicinity, it graphically shows libraries, post offices, etc., has overall and page grids that help with location, a comprehensive index and colors that help you discern neighborhood streets from local expressways, etc. This is by far the best map I've seen for the area and everyone I've shown it to agrees!"
2,First Aid Kit,Received item and appeared to be what I expected. Noticed there was no markings on cabinet to identify it as a first aid kit. Should have Red Cross or Wording which is easy to read.
4,Not quite her best,"I'm sorry to say that this video shows the great prima donna much past her prime. The once stupendous diva with the most luscious dramatic soprano voice and the most accurate coloratura technique within memory is in poor form here. The diva's high notes are thin and wobbling, her vibrato wide and unpleasant and sometimes shaking, and her coloratura, still not bad, but pale if you were to compare it to what she was capable of at her prime, some ten+ years earlier. But I still wouldn't want to be without this document. To hear a great diva near 60 attacking the most difficult arias and duets to have been written is remarkable. Horne, however is great, she way outsang Dame Joan Sutherland here. To hear Sutherland in her prime, I reccommend the bell telephone hour tape available here, and the cd ""The art of the prima donna""."
1,"Apron: its traditions, history and secret significances","I was looking for a book that would give me the traditions about aprons. Aprons we use in our homes, kitchens and to keep our clothing protected from spills. This wasn't the book I was looking for. Was disapointed, and should have looked closer before I bought it. It was good information if that was the type of apron I was looking for."
4,Get out a ruler,"The item is great, I just didn't realize how big it would actually be! It's big. Get out a ruler before you order it and get a few smaller ones while you're at it."
2,Quality good. Style disappointing,"I was disappointed in the width of the blade. I was hoping it would have a narrower, more tapered end."
2,BLEEDING WOODEN HANDLE,#THIS IS NOT A NATURAL WOODEN HANDLE! WHEN PRE-WASHED AND WASHED AFTER FIRST USE THE WOODEN HANDLE GOT DYE OR WHATEVER COLOR THAT WAS PUT ON THE WOODEN HANDLE ON MY DISH TOWEL AND COUNTER AND EVERYWHERE!; THE KNIFE BLADE WAS FINE BUT THE HANDLE DOES NOT STOP BLEEDING WHEN IT IS WASHED AND/OR WET; HORRIBLE!; IT MESSED UP MY DISH TOWEL BIG TIME!
3,An overview.. not instructional,"I bought this book based on the other reviews on this page. Maybe I didn't read them thourough enough. This seems to be more of an overview than an instructional manual, which I was looking for. Rarely are there steps to any of the excercises.. more of a 'Look at the example in 5-2.."". One thing that really bothered me is when there was numbered steps the examples always seemed to be on the flip page.. not on the opposing page making you turn the page back and forth. I've gotten thru 1/2 of chapter 5 now and it's agonizing. It does tell you about all the new features but I think it assumes that you've got a bit of experience with the products already. I'm going to look for a more step by step book or online training."
3,Perfect For Newbies,"This is a great book for people jus starting out using the Suite. It didn't help me much at all, which is not surprising...I bought it on a whim!"
2,Disappointed.,"I'm really disappointed with this product. It's supposed to be nonstick but unfortunately, it's not. The cookie trays are difficult to clean once they've been used a few times and the metal is peeling. Obviously, you get what you pay for."
1,This is not genuine Onyx!!!!,"False advertising, this is not Onyx, I verified this with a jeweler and it even looks like some kind of plastic or epxy. I own Onyx and it looks and feels nothing like it very obvious. I guess I should not have expected mych for the price but again issue after issue with ordering jewelry thru Amazon from every single seller and vendor. In the photo the black looks inset into the cross, it's not. It's actually glued on the top of it.... another let down."
5,delights in my boombox,"This is a pretty amazing collection. Although it features an incredible lineup, almost none of these artists had ever done any vocal music previously. You might think that such an experiment would be hit-and-miss, but all involved manage to come up with one mystifying hybrid or another, and it's really fun to hear them stretch out into the unknown. My favorites were the tracks by Herbert, Dtnl, Jesse Peterson & Tenants Band (aka Jamie Hodge), Smyglyssna, and Patrick Pulsinger Other compilations may be getting more hype, but this one shows, once again, label Plug Research taking no prisoners."
5,Great teaching tool for English conversation,"I have been teaching English to Japanese for over a decade using the Streamline English series because it is entertaining and easy to both teach and learn from. The series is very well crafted, giving grammar in easily digested doses with a strong component of fun.The audio cassette adds a lot to the course: breaking up lecture time, exposing students to others' speech patterns and pronunciation and giving an element of fun. Since I started with the British English series and have switched to the American series, my students and I enjoy comparing the differences in usage and even illustrative styles, since the pictures are very charming and often humorous.This is a great series which I highly recommend."
3,streamline`snotthebest,"The book has a lot of useful info and many visuals to figure things out about the content. It manages itself through the cassette that accompanies it. What I don`t like about the book is that it becomes boring for young adults and many times for adults as well. Each unit has to be dealt by the instructor which has to adapt writing exercises, grammar or speaking `cause the book is too limited and bound to repetitions."
3,NOT WHITE,"If you are looking for pure white sand, this is not it! It came in another package and was almost a grey color."
1,Not satisfied,I ordered 3 bags of sand to use for my Sand Unity Ceremony for my wedding. The Green and Pink came in perfect but the White Sand came in (in the same box as the other 2 bags of sand) but was in just a ziploc bag and had a hole in it. The moment I brought it inside the sand started leaking onto my floors. I wasn't very happy with the White Sand and I'm hoping to at least get an exchange for it.
1,The usual big monster at end....whoopee.,"This book would have made a fine already-been-done 80-page story. The book is 365 pages long, and it is very boring. VERY. It takes till page 300 for anything real to happen. Don't bother."
5,a hard-to-find classic that all film and chekhov lovers should see,"i was lucky enough to catch this film in the late 70s, wandering around by myself as a lonely student one day in switzerland, and looking for a rainy day matinee. i've never forgotten this perfect little film, in all these years, and only thru amazon have finally found it again. i'm now waiting for it to come in the mail but couldn't wait to write the review! what i remember clearly about it is feeling it was the only time i've seen chekhov rendered perfectly in another medium. there on the screen, with no fanfare, was all the sweetness and delicacy and heartbreakingness and charm and stupidity and passion and banality and mystery of life, all of it there so simply in evidence on the screen. one of his best short stories, one of the great black-and-white classics of russian cinema. bravo to all involved and thank you, amazon, for this long-sought prize."
3,DONT LIKE MODELS,"THIS WAS NOT LISTED CLEARLY AS A MODEL CAR iTHOUGHT IT WAS a die cast car , I DO NOT CARE FOR MODELSthank you"
4,Very Interesting,"I bought this for my husband who is in the military. He is also a history buff. I agreed to watch it with him, not all that happy about it. I quickly changed my mind. The transitions from scene to scene are nice and they way they describe the events is very real. For a documentary, this was entertaining."
2,Sneaky marketing,"I bought this DVD set because I thought it was the Time-Life ""Century of Warfare"" DVD series. IT'S NOT! This is published by TIMELESS which is not the same group as Time-Life. When I saw this in the store, I felt it wasn't marked to clearly indicate that this is NOT a Time-Life production. I feel that I was a bit mislead by the markings on this box. Perhaps the low price should have hinted to the fact that it's not the same except that this DVD set was on sale when I found it anyway. I found the markings and presentation of this DVD set to be confusing and misleading. I'm not saying it's not a decent DVD set; however, if you are looking for the product from the highly reputable Time-Life group...this is NOT it."
2,Not as bright as pictured,"I bought this pad on Amazon by looking at its image but when it arrived it was:1) the colors were not as bright as pictured, rather dull and dark2) very thinI guess for this price I could get something a little more lasting."
1,bot red white and blue - who has a maroon flag.,waste of money and SHIPPING COSTS!too bad not made even in america - maybe that's why they don't know what color our flag is.
2,"Good mouse pad, but not like pictured","This is a good quality mouse pad, just that the colors aren't anything near the photo on amazon. Almost black and white, or sepia. Quite disappointed."
4,"Interesting, not what I was really looking for...","I bought this book as an introducton to runes. It was in many bibliograpies of books I learned from and really enjoyed reading. It doesn't give any symbols or meanings of the runes I had begun working with and that was really surprising, given the title.However, this is a woman who was born to write, as well as cast. To say I enjoyed her style would be an understatement. I feel I learned a lot about preparing to cast, and how to interpret.This book wasn't what I was looking for, but I still found lots of great ideas and info in it."
4,Great Condition,"Ordered this text book for a master's class I enrolled in. Decided to try a ""used"" text to save money. Will start to use book in 1 week."
2,"good book, bad seller","I've had no problems with the book, besides the fact that when I received it there was coffee spilled all over the entire thing. Seller must have 'forgot' to mention it, considering how I still paid full price for it."
3,Ms. Bo,"Book in very good condition, but it was not new as stated in the selling information. Had only a few markings in it. Overall, very satisified with the book. Shipment was within the allotted time, but could have been faster. Payment was by credit card, so book should have been shipped once payment was confirmed."
4,Works Well except...,"This item lasts longer than others I have tried, is easier to fill and doesn't leak. However I feel they were a little generous with the number of cigars it can humidify. I would half the number of cigars or double the devices.UPDATED - OCT 2010I would still half the number of cigars HOWEVER, when I ordered a second one of these it actually came with instructions. I was filling this under a running faucet. WRONG. Soak in water for five minutes. They work great and mine last for a month. The humidor is in my finished basement."
3,better then........,"in the late '60s when i was learning to cook this book seemed great!I have been tring to find it. now i have it, it just seems like there's too much'dough' in the recipes. might be a good thing for 'new' cooks!"
5,Exactly as described. Fast delivery.,I received this book exactly as described and within a few days. Great response.
5,Awesome !,"Love this cookbook. Wish I'd found it sooner. It has become a favorite of everyone I gave a copy to for Christmas. Great, easy, delicious recipes!"
2,not that great,"I bought Bisquick II first and loved it. Gave this a look and didn't like it. Some of the recipes are in II book, making this one a waste of money. Most of the recipes have hardly nothing in them but onion, bisquick, and 1 other item sometimes.I recommend Bisquick II instead of this one."
4,good!,"While I don't use bisquick that much, it very handy to have when I'm in a hurry. I have only tried a few of the recipes, but they all were good. I'll definitely be trying more!"
2,Sad treatment of some great songs,"I have to say that all the song on this collection are first rate...that is they were the first time out. I found all of the selections were laden down with heavy base in addition to a recomposition of the entire song structure. Where this usually works fine when producers are mindful of the artistic integrity from which the song was born, the sprit and/or flavor in which these songs were recreated here is completely lost. The one song I was particularly sadden by was ""Someday We'll be Together"". This song has always had a wonderful gospel feel to it that served The Supremes, and their fans, well as their swan song. However here it is reduced to horrible mix of misdirected instrumentation and a tempo that has to be an insult to the songs composures Beavers/Bristol/Fuqua."
5,A Favorite,"This is one of my favorite albums. Great songs and reflections by Louise. Louise Mandrell is a fabulous entertainer who sings, dances, plays numerous instruments, is beautiful, etc and is still a down to earth, sweet lady. She is one of a kind! I highly recommend this CD."
5,Fantastic.,"3 short stories that took me 1 day to read. They centre round the ""Sexcapades"" book at Devine events. So far I have read 5 of these stories including 2 by Julie Elizabeth Leto but I read them in the wrong order. Looking for trouble (Leto) is 1st, then these 3 stories & after that Micki Carmichael's story Up to no good is last. Micki is the twin of Rory from Looking for trouble. I don't no if there are any more of these Sexcapades stories out there but i'm going to try & find out. I love them, they are fantastic."
3,Older book,Decent cover and the book was in good order however due to the age of the book you could see it had sat on a shelf but for what I needed it will work.
1,Not worth the price,"When I opened the package in front of a friend of mine and told him what I'd paid, he laughed in my face and said, ""You're supposed to get smarter as you get older."" I bought this for my sister as a gift and had to explain to her how I thought it was going to be much nicer. You would not expect this book to cost more than 20 dollars, maybe. Chintzy and outdated (according to copyright it hasn't been updated since 1977), if it wasn't so close to Christmas when I got it I would have sent it back."
1,"When it says FAMILY, it means FAMILY!","I had hoped to be able to put my family history - that is to say, my mother, father, grandfathers, grandmothers, maybe even my brothers and their respective familes in this book. But I find they mean FAMILY - as in husband/wife and his/her genealogy, back to Adam/Eve if possible, it seems. This book is not for a beginner who does not have a sharp Exacto blade to take out the pages he/she does not want or need. A book with the graphs built into it, letting you do the labeling and assorting would've been better - at least it wouldn't assume a 1950s family...."
3,Family Tree Book,"I found this book for a beginner quite helpful however, given that my research is already quite extensive essentially i have too much infomration for the book to hold. The book holds up to Great, Great, Great grandparents. Unfortuantely, i need a lot more room at this early stage of research and need to look for another book which holds more information. If you have a lot of research prior to the purchase of this book i would not buy it however, if all you have to start with is your grandparents then it most certainly is of value providing great tips on how to conduct research etc."
3,Read specs,"I did not read the specs on the size of cross. I can't remember now, if it was even provided. But, when the cross arrived, it was HUGE, much larger than what I wanted. This was a gift for my mom and I knew what size of a cross she wanted. Know what exactly what you are ordering. But, it was good quality and I kept that cross for myself and will use in on another chain. :)"
4,pleased,I was very happy with this product when I received it. It was just as it was described in the label. I am very happy with it and wear it all the time. Thank You.
5,The best glass for your best glass!,"I've used filters by many manufacturers, including Nikon, Hoya and Tiffen on my Nikon pro lenses. B+W filters are far and away the best. Superb quality glass and great craftsmanship make these a must for any serious photographer. Yes, they cost a little more, but why would you put a second-rate filter on a $1000+ lens?You can't go wrong with B+W."
3,A so so cpl filter,There is not much difference between the expensive b+w cpl with that of Hoya's. Hoys cpl costs about half the price. Both filters are exceptionally well made and they provide the identical image enhencement using the same lens on canon 5d2.
4,Didn't do that well as shown on photo review,It was good with bright light but not great w direct sunlight. ok with reflections. Not worth the price of 100. Will try ND for sun glare
4,Great Product,I rated this four stars only because I also have the the one that is the next step up for another lens and I like it a little better and I couldn't figure out how to give this four and a half stars.
5,Great polarizer,The polarizer really makes colors pop. I also think the construction and quality is great.
2,Defective product - poor customer service,I bought what I thought was a premium product. The filter arrived with grease on the lens that wil only smear and not come off. The manufacture agrees it is from manufacturing and is defective but will not pay return shipping.
2,B+W Circular Polarizer,"B+W 58mm Circular Polarizer MRC FilterWell made what with the brass ring construction, but it was ineffectual.Test shots were taken both with and without the filter mounted on my Canon G12.The test shots were taken outside, mid-day, of the land, and sky, around my home and included photographs facing East, South & West to test the sky darkening function of the camera - results shown little or no polarizing effect.I also tested the filter, hand held, to test the elimination of reflection from a number of sources such as automobile windows, painted surfaces, etc - same results.Last I tested for color enhancement properties of the filter on the grass, trees and flowers - same results.I have used other mfr's polarizing filters on another camera I own with much better results.Last I'd advise that you test any polarizing filter you may wish to purchase before spending money on something that may not perform to your satisfaction."
1,Very poor quality,"I bought this filter from B&H two years age. I was very surprised after I opened the box --- the filter was already broken. Then I returned it and bought another one from an eBay seller. After one year, the second one also broke. I also bought some Hoya filters which are still in good condition."
3,"Great pictures, poor design...",The polarizing offered by this polarizer is excellent... 5 stars. What has not been five stars is that this polarizer likes to bind up and get stuck on my lenses (brand new canon L's).... and believe me i put in on VERY lose. This might not be that much of a problem except of the front part of the polarizer spins (it is supposed to).. and the part your supposed to grip to take it off is literally about 2-3 mm wide.costs to much for this problem...
5,Excellent CPL Filter!,"Awesome filter, I ordered this to replace a Tiffen CPL that binded to the the threads in my 17-40mm L USM lense. The construction of the B&W filter is made by much higher quality and the color saturation and reflection elimination is much better than the tiffen."
5,Gifted words: http://www.broadjam.com/khor,"As an artist/engineer/music composer, I found this book very helpful in easing some of the things that I have on becoming Joyful...is to follow the dream...yet there is so much that I am trying to ""protect"". This book is an all round words of wisdom and the author seems to know how to express what my difficulties are and what to do about it. I am not so alone and it is great that she followed her dream to fruition. She made it possible for herself to share her gifts, in return, help us to share our dreams."
5,Practical books with some great tips,"I really enjoyed this book because it gave me some new ideas and helped me to eliminate several of my time wasters. I would place this book in the useful, recommended category because I believe that there is something for everyone here. If you want to OPTIMIZE your success and experience everyday happiness, I strongly recommend you read Optimal Thinking: How to Be Your Best Self which shows you how to make the most of every situation and gives you roadmaps to resolve painful feelings by yourself. I can't imagine ever needing a therapist since I read Optimal Thinking. If you have these books on your bookshelf, you will be self-reliant and happy too."
2,"Fun, but is it worth it...?","We've bought a Sphere every summer for the past 3 years. Two children (7,8) love love love this toy and know better than to flatten it or play with it out of the pool, they just roll around the inside screaming and laughing. Every year it rips right at the seams where the two colors meet, usually within 2 months. (I bought one for a friend and with heavy play theirs lasted the weekend.) I have continued to buy it because it is seriously an amazing amount of fun for the kids, but since I'm writing this review 24 hours after our latest rip (and less than a month after we bought this one), I'm definitely done with The Sphere!"
1,Great until it comes apart,"First off I actually bought two of these last summer. Kids loved this, that is until it came apart with in only a couple of weeks. I took a chance and exchanged it for another hoping the next wouldn't fall apart, which it did at the seams just like the other. When it does you end up with a bunch of floaties. Very disappointing because it was so cool!! My kids aren't at all tough on their toys either. If this stayed together it would be great, but it doesn't."
1,Swimline Sphere...JUNK!!!,Purchased the Sphere for my two girls (10/8) for our pool. It lasted two days. The entire sphere fell apart in pieces leaving just the individual panels. Not worth the money given the two days of use.
1,Don't Bother,"This toy ripped along the seams after one use and lost air in one end BEFORE it was used at all. The size of it is nice, even for bigger kids, but if you are looking for a toy that will withstand even mild action for just one season, don't buy this one."
2,very poor construction and design. not durable.,"This has the potential to be a fun pool toy but it doesn't last more than a day or 2. We have had THREE of these (yes, that's right, 3!). The first one, my daughter received as a gift...within a week, the sides had separated from each other and the people who gave it to her contacted Amazon for a replacement. We saved the replacement for use this summer, inflated it, and within a week, fell apart AGAIN. i felt bad for my daughter and bought a replacement one (the price had gone down since last summer) and after about 3 uses, the little ring that runs around the top had completely come off! Third time burned, will NEVER BUY AGAIN.Again, it seems like a good idea, but until they can construct it to hold together with normal use don't waste your money. (For the record, my daughter is very small--about 65 pounds in the 6th grade!) and does not abuse the sphere...just normal floating and rolling."
5,Awesome fun,"Best pool toy I have ever invested in. Kids 5 and under don't get rowdy enough to damage it. Very safe, and the kids can't get enough of it!! Would buy it again and recommend to anyone with young kids."
1,lasted one hour!! Not Durable at all!!!!!,"Kids played with this for about 1 hour before the ring at the end ripped off. Within 15 mins of that, seams came apart and the ring collapsed!Very expensive toy for 1 hour of playing.."
2,Dissapointed,We just had this toy for two weeks and it broke at the seams. It may be better if only a couple of kids play with it. It's not good for large groups.
2,Take it easy,"ball lasted about 2 weeks around the kids before it broke at the seems, then it became flotation devices for about 6 people. (6 sided sphere)Would not buy again, unless I planned on just getting it for the kids to watch it float in the pool."
2,Never again,seams started ripping in the first week - one section had a hole on the seam and could never patch. Don't buy not worth it
1,Great idea for kids. Durable and fun.,My kids have had tons of fun with this ball. Great idea. We've had it now for a week and when the kids come home they go right for the pool. Thank you for the Sphere Floating Habitat. It rocks!
2,Very fun but doesn't hold up,"I purchased this toy for my daughter's 11th birthday. The kids love playing in this, but as many other reviewers stated, it does not hold up. I hoped to have it hold up a good part of the summer but it didn't last three days. As other reviewers said, it tears at the seams. I exchanged this with Amazon for a new one to try one more time and again, it lasted a couple of days with normal kid usage. This is a very fun toy - I hope the manufacturer will improve its durability...if so, we would definitely buy again."
2,Great for about 3 times in the pool.,The sphere was a lot of fun. The kids were excited and loved it -- for about a week and then it just fell apart.
3,Disappointed,"Unfortunately this item was damaged when we received it. One of the panels had a leak and continued to loose air. Had it not been for this defect , I'm sure it would have been great summer fun!"
5,An essential book for thinking knitters,"Debbie New is the most innovative knitter since Elizabeth Zimmerman, and Unexpected Knitting is a book that provides inspiration and new directions (literally! she designs at all angles) to even experienced needlers. New has an organic sense of her projects; she knows her materials and is willing to experiment. She has the gift also of being able to explain clearly, in words and in charts, exactly how she has produced her groundbreaking designs. Not all her designs or techniques will appeal to all knitters, but there is some new insight to be gained in every project she describes, and everyone will find something wonderful among the sweaters, jackets, and art pieces beautifully displayed and explained in this volume.This is not a book for a true beginner, but for anyone with a grasp of the basics, it will extend horizons tremendously. This is something genuinely new and genuinely exciting in the world of knitting. Buy it!"
4,"Nice book, more arty than practical","I love the book, very nice ideas and great pictures. In my opinion it is not so great for it's practical patterns (the ideas are nice but the sweaters are shapeless) but for nice original ideas."
2,Abit passe.,This is a collection of artwork with instructions that are very hard to understand. Designs are now quite ordinary.
4,The title sums it all up,"Mind boggling knitting at it's best, great pictures and some of the tutorials are a little vague but IMHO it is worth taking the time to read thru them carefully."
4,Harumi Hosono is amazing,"Truly the most versatile musician I've ever heard of, Hosono has done it all, from his folky Happy End days, to the proto-synth and electronica of Yellow Magic Orchestra, to some noodling around by himself, and then finally rejoining his buddy from YMO to create Sketch Show. For being an old guy, this album is really a testament to how musically open-minded Hosono seems to be. This album can best be described as kind of mid-90's, laid-back electronica, kind of reminiscent of Bjork or Mum, but more delicate and less vocal-centric. Traum 6.6 really stands out as a good track, download it to see if you like the album. I recommend!"
1,Absolutely laughable,"Speaking as one who has not read the book, but having been a child in a divorce where debra goldenberg represented my father, I would not give this woman one cent of my money.Her involvement, in my opinion, aggravated a contentious situation farther with her borderline unethical behavior.I can't put into words the harm that this woman has caused my family, but I can stand that in my opinion, and that of my brothers, she in no way advocated for the child in family matters.For her to have written a book titled 'Representing the child in family law matters' is absolutely laughable.All of my opinion, of course."
2,Knights and A dragon.....,"These pieces were too small for a 3 year old. My own fault for not investigating size. Only one dragon, nothing moves.....not what I really wanted."
4,Safari Knights & Dragon Toob,"This is a Christmas gift for my grandson. Had it sent to my daughters in CO. She said Cole will love these figurines. I ordered the castle as well & know he will love both for hours & hours of play. Everything arrived on time & was in excellent shape. Wish I could be a fly on the wall Christmas morning but, I'll be in NC this Christmas."
3,exactly what I was lookinng for,This set was just what I needed. My daughter (age 2) loves horses and this set was excellent for her! There were 4 horses and two riders that would fit any of the horses. I had a hard time finding this set and was told it has been discontinued so I was very happy to find it on amazon for only $[...].
2,"Tiny, tiny people",I bought this to go along with a castle that I was buying for my great grandson. The figures are extremely small. They should be about double the size that they are to be played with effectively.
5,Cute little animals.,Seems to be good quality. Cute baby size animals. Purchased to go along with the Melissa and Doug fold and go barn.
3,so so,the animals do not stand up sell. the barn is too small and the tractor broke within the first two days it was used. The animals work for what I needed them for.
2,Farm Animals Disappointed! Smaller than advertised!,"I read a lot of reviews of animal figures before buying these and now I know, why they are so much cheaper than buying them separately. They are not at all like the Safari figures that you can buy separately. These are much smaller and are not to scale at all! The ""tallest"" is the rooster with 1.5"". All the other animals don't even reach that minimum and non of them reach the advertised 3"" in height. Also the chicken and rooster are the same hight as the cows - weird.Luckily Amazon returns and refunds are so easy!"
2,Shorted me a horse,Love the horses but this time I was shorted a horse. It was supposed to contain 12 horses & it came unopened with only 11!
4,Good product,I was a little disappointed when we got these because they are so small. But my kids love the farm and the more animals the better. I actually used them for my farm cake which did work better because I was able to get more animals on the cake.
3,Kids enjoy them but quality isn't that great.,The kids really enjoy these and were excited about the quantity but when they arrived the paint was already chipping off of them. I'd say these would be considered a good dollar store item but I don't think they are worth anymore than $8-$10 so they are a bit over priced.
3,A little over priced,"I was a little disappointed when I opened my package and saw how small the tube was, I guess I didn't realize how big and how few were in the set when I made purchase. When I checked, The price is consistent across the web and in my local stores though if I had seen what I was purchasing in person I would have spent my money elsewhere, don't get my wrong the figures are good quality just not worth the $10 for 12 little guys you get."
4,Small Knights/Dragon in a Tube by Safari,My son enjoys playing with this product. He has another set of knights and sets up battles with his Knights. This product is good for imaginative play.
4,Surprisingly Entertaining,"My wife bought these for our 2-year old daughter and at first I was skeptical. She plays with them often and they are good because she can identify the individual animals (sheep, horse, cow, dog, etc) by herself or when we sing ""Farmer in the Dell"". Only downside is they are HARD, so be careful about kids throwing or hitting with them."
4,My son loves these!,We purchased these as a decoration for my son's castle cake. They worked great and the kids have all been having a great time playing with them! They are small so beware if you have little ones toddling around but they are great to grab in the bag to take places on the go. Very cute!
3,"Eh, they're alright",They get the job done. They don't all stand up but my five year old doesn't seem to care much. A little flimsy.
2,need to be thicker for support while single hand writing,They really need to make out of a thicker material for support while single hand writing.If on a counter/support they are fine.
5,"Classic Hymns, Classic Campbell style.","I have had this release for a number of years on cassette and it was time to change up to a CD. I do use mp3 quite a bit, but I like a CD. If I want a mp3, that's easy enough from that point.The music is all Glen, as only Glen can do it. It also has a special meaning now that Glen is fading mentally with dementia and will not be back on stage. That is sadly, an unsettleing thought which adds to the fondness of this classic. But, it means so much to listen to these old favorites and respect that Campbell touch that Glen put on every one of the tracks. He always had good taste in the way he presented his music."
5,i love and emember this well!,"My sister and I were so excited when we got this book, and we never forgot about it...We are 33 years old now, and it has kind of become our way of saying something is ""fun""....whenever we do a craft or art project, we compare it to this book, ""doesn't this remind you of when we played with Richard Scarry's rainy day book?"" And its always a little bittersweet, because we no longer have our book. Imagine my delight, to find an old copy of the book, here on amazon! I can't wait for it to come in the mail, and I will surprise my sister!"
5,"Laugh, cry, and die.","This book was excellent in all meanings of the word. As an actress, I would definitely reccomend this book to any aspiring actresses looking for a monologue for an audition, a drama class, or just for having a good reading. This is one of the best monologue books for women that I have ever read."
5,Kitchen essentials,"We got a set of these over twenty years ago as a wedding shower gift. They are versatile, and (so far) indestructible. There is a fourth, larger, size we also have, and between the four bowls, its easy to go from meal prep, baking, and serving to storage. Plus, they stack together nicely, so they don't take up much storage space."
3,Very thorough,"Very thorough guide to IP law and regulations. A little hard to get a survey of the broader regulatory landscape, but still a good resource."
1,Just wrong.,"I only read the patent section, and have no knowledge of the other sections. However I have found the book to be entirely too superficial to be of any assistance. Additionally, at more than one occasion on topics that are fairly important, the information was just wrong. I have read the patent section of my IP supplements to prepare for the exam, and I by far recommend the IP hornbook. It's a little longer but WAY worth it over this book. If your library doesn't have a copy and it's too expensive for you, then try Examples and Explanations, but whatever you do, don't just rely on this book, you'll look like an idiot when you completely misstate some things. I mean 90 to 95% of it is right, I'm sure, but I'm going to get enough wrong on my own, I don't need help."
1,Flying Guns of World War I,"You certainly can't judge a book by it's cover! This volume is very sparsely illustrated, no real detail on guns such as the Spandau, Parabellum etc... Forty pages of the book are taken up by useless tables, which guns were mounted on what aircraft. Again, no supporting illustrations or detailed photos. You can find far more info on this subject on the web. Save your money. I really don't know how the author can proclaim himself as the expert on the subject!"
3,Not Our Favorite,My four year old twin boys LOVE our V-Tech Smile and have enjoyed all of the cartridges we've purchased so far but we found this one hard to control at times . . . particularily when moving Thomas around corners (the joystick has to be held straight up/down/right/left to work). The other adventures seem to be a bit easier but overall I'd say there are other games that are better (Dora and Spiderman are two of their favorites!)
3,wrong age group for this one,"My son loves his V-smile, he plays it constantly. It really is a great product but I have a hard time believing this particular game is designed for a child under 6 years old, even though it is labeled for 4-7 year old children. There is a certain game where it is very difficult making the trains turn on the tracks in the direction of the letters. This is impossible for a young child I end up struggling with it, it is hard even for an adult to get that little train to turn! I don't think they properly tested this game. It is a cute idea and if you don't mind sitting there thoughout the game and helping with the difficult situations you'll be fine."
4,vtech thoms the tank smartridge for v smile,"Gift for grandson who just had a birthday- I'm sure he is going to enjoy it,"
4,Pleased Mother,My 4-year-old son loves Thomas and enjoys this game alot. I do agree that turning the corners can be tricky and a bit frustrating but my son does not mind at all but he tends to have a longer attention span than even myself.
2,Black slim jewel cases arrived damaged,"I ordered 50 black slim jewel cases. 7 of them were damaged, 6 of those were unusable. This is the only time that i received jewel cases from Amazon that any were damaged. I will continue ordering from Amazon. unless o receive more damaged jewel cases. I do not remember if this was from Amazon or shipped by a second party."
3,It was just ok,"It was ok but when i got the package about 6 of them was broken, which was sad but over all it was ok."
3,magnetman,Have gone through 8 of the cases so far and found one to have a broken hinge. Not a good percentage rate.
4,They work,"These are acceptable cases. They can be a little too fragile if not treated gently. The center hub dosen't always hold the disc completely secure but... These are a budget priced case and perform as such. If you buy these understanding that, you won't be disappointed. If you open and close your cases often, these are probably not for you. But used for storage with occassional opening these work fine. Yes there are better cases made and they are also more expensive. I had no problems with breakage on delivery."
5,Slim Jewel Cases,I purchased the 50 pack Slim Jewel Cases to hold and to protect my CDs. They are just what I needed. The quality to very good and I would not hesitate to order them again.
3,50-pack Slim Jewel Cases,Cases are great but the shipping method trashed 1/4 of them. If I were to buy again it would be at a local store. The way these are packaged for shipping sucks.
1,Very Poor Packaging!,"Can't really rate it, I returned them.... They were very poorly packaged and all were broke, not much more I can say about that. It was easy to return them."
1,Amazon Needs Packing Lessons,"What can you say about CD cases? These would be adequate....if they hadn't arrived damaged. Whoever does the packing for Amazon should learn that a single sheet of brown paper will NOT prevent shipping damage. A little bubble wrap may be more expensive, but it would have prevented my returning this order for a refund."
2,Quick Reference for the Mechanical Engineering PE Exam,"At first glance, this book appears to have omitted many useful equations. I purchased it to save the trouble of preparing my own quick reference ""cheat sheets"". Looks like I'll still have to prepare them."
2,Must be popular...,"This item must be very popular, because I never received it and the company mistakedly sent me the incorrect item that I returned. I would have given a better rating if I had actually gotten the chance to use it...sorry about that maybe others have gotten some benefits from this product."
4,Decent,"After just finishing the book myself, I would say that overall it's worth reading. However, at the very minimum a basic standing in aeronautics is required. The main concentration of the text is on the pre Wright and sonic flight eras. But it also goes into mildly how some of the basic concepts where found/formulated. The book itself, mentions that it's a precursor to a series of in-depth books due to come out, so the basic theme is not an in-depth and all encompassing material but to merely breeze over most of the big name ideas. It gleams over the past 100 years or so of aviation in a brevity 220 pages of paper. I would say that the book is worth the money if the reader has a understanding of aeronautics and once to be able to have readable and not a text book."
5,Completely satisfied!,This product was received in a very timely manner and matched the description in the review by the seller. I was very satisfied.
2,"BE WARNED, DISAPPEARING VERSES","THERE ARE SEVERAL VERSES MISSING FROM THIS VERSION OF THE BIBLE. PLEASE, LOOK FOR YOURSELF.Matthew 17:21 Matthew 18:11 Matthew 23:14 Mark 7:16Mark 9:44 Mark 9:46 Mark 11:26 Mark 15:28Luke 17:36 Luke 23:17 John 5:4 Acts 8:37Acts 15:34 Acts 24:7 Acts 28:29 Romans 16:24EASY TO READ AND UNDERSTAND, SO I WILL GIVE IT 2 STARS FOR THAT. But if any man shall TAKE AWAY FROM THE WORDS of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life.Read it for yourself and then go and find a good NKJ version."
5,The Bible really became life to me.,The Inspirational Study Bible has been one of the most important books in my life. For the first time in my life I have enjoyed reading the Bible. It has been so refreshing to be able to read the Bible AND understand it. I began my journey through the Bible in the beginning(Genesis) and was so intrigued I read almost the whole book in one sitting. Lucado's Life Lesson's are great! They are so down to earth and fun to read. I have recommended this Bible to all my friends and will ocntinue doing so. Keep up the good work!
5,Great New Century Version,I chose this version because I needed a study bible that was new Century version. Max Lucado is great and I figured this would be a good bible to choose
1,Item sold is not same as pictured...,"Item includes an additional six inches of chain above the swivel...which is not pictured. That's great for people hanging a heavy bag from the ceiling. However, when not requiring the use of that additional six inches (like a heavy bag stand) the only thing to do with it is let it hang on top of the chains holding the bag. This is makes it EXTREMELY loud as the chains clang against each other. Good luck getting it off...there is no way unless you're superman and can bend steel."
2,The S hook wasn't strong enough to hold the bag,"Great price and prompt service, but the main S hook was undersized. Several weeks after I hung the bag the S hook totally deformed and failed. It wasn't designed to hold a full sized heavy bag. Fortunately I had another one laying around that is working."
4,a bit too long,great product but the chains were a bit too long wish i had a gotten shorter one cuz i dont like it too low
5,Positive w/o being Preachy,"I read this book in one sitting and vacilatted between laughing out loud and wanting to put my fist in the air in support of the protagonist. The humor displayed in the pages was sharp and at times scathingly honest. I loved this book and will definitely read more by CM.I think she was spot on the pulse of teenagehood and dealt with heavy issues such as body image, eathing disorders, puberty, date rape, feminism, family dysfunction without wagging her fingers at the reader. This book was definitely superior to _Gossip Girl_.The audience for this book is primarily a lay audience, but I could see the books being used in humanities courses."
5,"The earth, my butt, and other big round things","This book was sooo cool! It's sad because Virginia is over weight and has a hard time dealing with it 'cause her other family members are perfect. It's REALLY a good book, and i recommend it to every girl thats been trying so hard to fit in when they were born to stand out and make a difference in life. A little perv, but other than that, this book deserves 5 stars. :)"
4,Two Thumbs Up!,"First of all, the cover itself grabbed my attention. As I began to read the first couple of pages, I couldn't seem to put the book down. I think this book can relate to a lot of teenage girls especially in this day and age where image and social status seem to be the main concerns of these girls. This book touches subjects such as eating disorders, date rape, insecurity, and depression. This book may appeal to mostly girls, but I think it can relate to everyone because these issues do not happen to just girls.Besides the serious subjects this book displays, it can be highly entertaining and funny. Virginia is a funny character. Her ability to look past her looks and finally become content with herself sets off an empowering vibe that should inspire girls to do the same."
4,Add my positive comments to all the others,"What can I say? This book was absolutely wonderful. It appeals to all age groups (I am NOT a teenager).The writing was witty and refreshing but more importantly, the subject matter was handled with a sensitive, yet positive view. This book is a MUST for all teenagers struggling with body image.Buy it."
4,Enjoying Read,For virginia shreves life is hard... mainly because shes big. She meets with this guy every monday and has sex with him.she realizes that it is wrong but keeps going. While they grow an amazing friendship. I loved this book and can relate kinda because we are the same age. Altho its fast paced in the begining its a slow happy ending. this was a quick read for me even tho im a reluctant reader. this book has a range of thirteen to sixteen. no earlier because of the sex. Awesome book. Amazing author. Creative story. a must read
1,extremely overrated and not funny at all,"It seems like a normal happy crappy little book, but in reality it's much darker, with date rape and anorexia and bulimia and of course the want to be popular.If you want a laugh avoid The earth my butt and other big round things.If you want a really bad book read it.I thought the main story (wanting to be normal and ""fit in with the popular crowd"") was so lame and such a cliche. This plot line has been used in HUNDREDS of other teen novels. I'm really sick of it!!! Can't authors think for themselves?"
3,.,"This book wasn;t as good as I hoped it would be. I just didn't like the fact that Virginia didn't stick to her diet - she was always going back to junk food instead of making a healthier and wiser choice. Otherwise, I thought it wwas alright..."
1,This book is junk!!!!!!!,this book was not good at all and not worth reading. the character is totally pathetic and superficial because she wants a boyfriend and will settle for anyone and do anything. she doesnt have any self respect or confidence and if she is so desperate to lose weight she should just excersize!!!!
5,Beautifully Candid Teen Fiction,"Virginia Shreves feels like the blonde, overweight exception to her perfectly fit, brunette family. Her mother is a beautiful adolescent psychologist, her father rarely around but equally successful, and her brother is the big man on campus at Columbia University. Virginia lives by her laugh-out-loud hilarious Fat Girl Code of Conduct, and has recently started an awkward romantic relationship with class reject Froggy. Virginia's perceptions change as she realizes her family dynamic isn't as simple as she thought. Her mom unfairly criticizes Virginia for being overweight, and her brother's social status is ruined by a campus scandal. Said scandal and Virginia's language when dealing with issues in her life make this book more appropriate for mature teen readers, but this book is a wonderfully funny, realistic portrayal of high school life of an overweight female teen trying to lose weight for all the wrong reasons."
5,Well-rounded reading,"This book was wonderful. As soon as I saw the title I was hooked. I couldn't put the book down and I felt so much for Virginia. She is a strong character and the reader can look to her for inspiration when dealing with obstacles in life, and she had a lot of obstacles that she overcame. Meet Virginia. You'll fall in love with her like I did."
5,"The Earth, My Butt, and Other Big Round Things",Excellent book! Easy and fun read. This girl reminded me of many of girls her age who struggle with weight. I think the characters and their situations are easy to relate to at some point in the story because you can identify with the intense feelings that are in this book. I still think about it to this day and smile. I really fell in love with the main character. It is very easy to like these characters. I can't say one bad thing about this book. I'd read it again for sure.
3,"The Earth, My Butt, and Other Big Round Things","While I enjoyed reading The Earth, My Butt, and Other Big Round Things, I was disappointed that the humor exhibited in the opening chapters faded. I liked the ""Moped"" metaphor. Again, it was an enjoyable read."
3,"The Earth, My Butt, and Other Big Round Things","This is a pretty good ""coming of age"" book for teenagers. It had the important message that even families that look good on the outside often have issues. I would recommend this to 13-17 year old kids."
5,A book worth Reading!!!,"Wow this book really turned me around because the title and the story ar so diffrent!The story is pretty dramatic but the title is funny,but as you read this you realize the title does not matter and the story end's beautifuly and you see how virgina the girl in the story comes out of her box and realize's she can be better then the most popularist and skiniest girl at school!I reccomend this book for teen's and teens at heart,go read it now!"
4,cute little story,"at first I just thought that the book was a pretty decent story about a funny girl who is larger than average..... however the book evolves into a wonderful story about a girl who emerges from the ashes of her life and frees herself to become a girl with her own identity, who is proud to be who is she is.... a good rebellion"
4,"the earth, my butt, and other big, round things","""the earth, my butt, and other big, round things"" is a tale of an overweight teenaged girl (virginia) who must face the hardships of being a teen and living up to everyone's standards. it's heartfelt and amusing. it captures the essents of reality in the high school world. Carolrn Mackler has writtin an inspiring novel that will capture the hearts of millions of teenaged girls. her relationship with froggy is that of a backstreet relationship, which is more common in high school than thought of. Mackler has a way with words to inspire teen girls."
5,Exactly what I needed!,I am so happy with this product and with my entire experience with Amazon. I had lost the cord for my camera and was unable to upload pictures from my camera to my laptop. This cord is a lifesaver!
2,Return item,"Not the one that fix,y camera and end of not being able to use it did return the merchandise to the store"
1,"Disappointment, didn't work with 3100- UGH!","I got this thinking, okay, Amazon says this is a ""Nikon"" cord so I thought it was going to be a good idea, NOT!I double checked to make sure my 3100 was on the list in the description and now that it nowhere near fits I haveto waste my time returning it and trying to find another one somewhere else...really Amazon? Ridiculous... the partthat plugs into the camera doesnt look like the picture and isn't like the original cord I was replacing,it's slightly slanted."
1,Cable I received was not the Nikon UC-E6,The cable shipped to me was not the Nikon UC-E6 cable. The cable that was sent to me did not work with my Nikon camera. I notified the company and they reshipped the same incorrect cable. Would not order with them again. I ordered the Nikon UC-E6 cable through the NikonMall online which I wish I did to begin with.
1,This is not a UC-EC cable!,"Although the description says this is a UC-E6 cable and it is shipped in a box that says Nikon UC-E6, what you get is UC-E4 which does not fit the S3100 as described. If you need a UC-E6, type that into the search heading in Amazon and you'll find many options that are actually the correct product. Good luck!"
2,Didn't fit my camera,I have a coolpix 8800.The product information said the usb would fitmy camera but it did not.
1,NOT for Coolpix 4200,"Though the description specifically lists the Nikon Coolpix 4200 as compatible with this cable, the cable does NOT fit the camera. I had to send it back.Using the online return form, Amazon was going to charge me shipping for the pleasure of sending this back- but luckily when I called customer service they were helpful and immediately waived return shipping costs."
1,Should have read reviews before ordering:,"Yes, I should have read the reviews before ordering this item. I misplaced my USB cable for my camera Coolpix S3100 and i ordered the cable through these people or firm, and was so happy to receive my cable that i instantly had connected to AC Adapter/Charger(that i ordered also) and of course DID NOT WORK, ok maybe i figure it was the AC adapter/charger. so i connect USB cable to my laptop and IT DOES NOT WORK. so why return it, by reading reviews they will still send something that doesn't work.I will not order nothing from here, Thanks alot for nothing."
4,Basic camera cord,"There's not much to say, but when you need a cable, you need it, and I got it promptly."
3,real quick delivery!!,"Ordered and received two business days later, great service.Product works perfectlyLove amazon!"
2,wrong item,"I received the wrong cable for my camera. I would overlook it but I was charged over $7.00, for shipping, for a very small USB cable that only weighs a few ounces. I would not have ordered it but I needed a new battery and charger. When searching for these 2 items on Amazon I received an offer of this cable for just pennies when purchased with the other two items. I didn't realize I would be slammed with a $7.00 shipping charge for the tiny USB cable alone. And to add insult to injury, it is the wrong cable. This is the second time this has happened to me through Amazon. The return policy states that returns are valid 30 days after I receive the item, yet Amazon has cut me off from returning it using 30 days from the order date instead of the day that I received it. Not happy, it would have been easier and cheaper to buy the items at the mall."
1,Mine was BROKEN!!!!!,ONLY 5 BUCKS PLUS SHIPPING LOST- BUT A PAIN IN MY REAR END GAINED FOR THE 5 BUCKS. THE CONNECTER IS BROKEN AND THE WIRE EXPOSED. IT IS SHORTED OUT AND BROKEN
1,not the right one,"I have a nikon coolpix s3100 and this did not fit my camera. Very disappointed. I don't know how to return anything, because nothing was inside the package about returns."
3,Cable for camera,It worked okay but the cables didn't seam to fit just right like the original set. Got a new camera shortly after this purchase.
5,"It was exactly what I needed to operate my digital camera,",This product enabld me to charge the battery in my camera. The original item had diisappeared and this item could not be found locally.
1,Did not work,The cable attached to the adapter but would not charge my camera. The cable for my camera did not work.
2,doesnt work for my camera,The manual said Nikon UC-E6 is the correct part but when I plug it into my computer it doesnt work. I dont know why.
1,Don't Buy This,"I lost my camera charger a while back so I thought it would be nice to just order online since I live far away from a Best Buy or something. I was glad to get the product on time and so excited to use it with my camera but when I tried using it, it didn't work at all.It was a waste of time and money and ruined my online shopping experience. I am going to drive one and a half hours to the nearest store to buy a cord."
1,It is a cable,"You'd think Nikon would follow industry standards for USB connectors, but they don't, making this cable necessary. For 5 bucks it's not exactly a huge hole in the wallet, but is certainly a serious annoyance that you can't just go to most big box retailers and pick up a replacement cable. Seriously guys, come on...get with the times. In general I make it a practice to refuse to buy any products that do this to consumers but then again, I can't for the life of me justify my Zune/iPod purchases. The product works as advertised but the practice of non standard connectors pisses me the hell off."
4,Just what I needed,The item I received was exactly what I needed it was a nikon 25604 uc-e6 usb cable fit my coolpix s200 camera perfect and the shipping was very quick.
1,"Right number, wrong cable--Does not fit !!!",I should have read all of the reviews! This cable does not fit a D3100 Nikon. Apparently the company has known about it for the last 4 years and not corrected the problem. Made in China.
1,Doesn't Work,"I should have paid attention to the other reviews on this site. Bargain Cell seems to sell cheap knock-off products that may or may not work, but which are too cheap to bother returning. In my case, I was having trouble finding an original Nikon cable and ended up ordering this. The good news is that the cable I received charged my camera. The bad news is that it wouldn't transfer photos. In fact, my computer didn't even recognize that a device was attached when I plugged my camera in with this cable. I ended up ordering a card reader as well so I could transfer photos to my computer. Eventually I found a cable sold by J&R Music for $10, shipping included. The J&R cable is an original Nikon cable and works perfectly. In the future I'll stay well away from bargain Cell products."
1,Nikon UC-E6 Replacement USB,"Cheap price was what I was looking for...maybe too cheap. Got here quickly, just the cable does not work...But the price was so low I am just going to eat it and go to Best Buy."
1,Part number not for camera,"Although I researched the item and got the correct part number, it does not fit the camera I have which is a Nikon Coolpix L5. This description did not list the L5 but other sites have. Nikon's site says this is the part number for the L5. The item is too large for the camera. So there is no replacement for the L5? Interesting."
4,Worked well,I charge my devices in a lot of different places and having this makes it really handy so I can have charging cords in different places.
1,Didn't fit......didn't work!,"I was told this was the right model to fit my camera, but it did not. Now I'm stuck with it. All the money went towards the shipping, so can't get that back."
1,Buyer Beware,"This company does not accept returns or refunds for any reason;I bought two cables; one did not fit the camera; however, the second one did and it is just luck that I ordered two."
1,SUCKS,Hey I never got my thing.....so How can I review it. This seller steals money....do not buy.Bryon
1,Does NOT fit P100,"This does NOT even fit into my CoolPix P100, stay away.... The cord does not even go into the camera slot."
3,Works OK,"Cord works great for charging but sometimes doesn't allow the camera to be recognized on either Mac. Haven't tried it on my Windows machine because all the computers have SD slots.Shipped quickly and arrived soon, which was great as we had lost our other one and the camera requires it to charge."
4,"Interesting, Revealing, Not Long Enough","The author seems like he has ""secret ideas"" about the Bakker's in this too-short book, but is afraid to be overly revealing. He isn't a terrific writer, either, but it was a pretty good read, giving you Some insight into the Bakker's."
2,Slight Caution,"This was recommended to us by a 9 year old. Our son, also 9, who read all of the Harry Potter books said he was creeped out by it. Sounds like pure fantasy so maybe it was just his reaction. We might save it for later. I would say try one in the series if you are interested and monitor how your child reacts to it."
1,Not for younger or sensitive children....,"My 9 1/2 year old son was intrigued with this title and the description which promises 'harrowing' but 'hilarious.' He's a very good reader with a great sense of humor, and he likes slightly scary stories, so I bought it. However, he read only eight of the stories before he put the book down with great disappointment and disgust. He said the stories he read weren't funny, none of the characters were at all likeable, and that a kid is killed in the eighth story.So I read those first eight stories, and I have to agree. These stories are harrowing, as promised, and more creepy than scary. They are not poorly written, however, and one was even a little funny (thus, my one star), but they're certainly not for every kid. If your kids, like mine, believe even fictional children shouldn't die for entertainment, pass on this one."
4,Everything I wanted and more...,"Omar Vizquel is one of the greatest shortstops to ever play the game. Often overshadowed by Jeter, ARod, and Garciaparra, he makes the barehand play look routine and turns a double play better than any of them. This book gives you the insiders view of Game Seven of the World Series and the come-from-behind Seattle game (down 12 runs in the 7th). It was also cool to read about what the players do off the field. If want great stories about baseball and the greatest shortstop playing the game, then this is the book for you..."
3,A must for any OMAR fan!,"I love Omar - and reading this book made me love him even more! It's a fun book to read because it's filled with great Omar stories, all written in a very ""conversational"" tone. The co-author is Bob Dyer, a local newspaper columnist, who I have long thought to be a terrific writer. You will love this book! (His new video is great, too!)"
4,Great Golden Glove,"Omar has continued his fantastic career from Seattle to Cleveland...I plan to ask him to sign it, then will present it to Seattle pitcher Arthur Rhodes and see his reaction."
4,Fun read for fans of the tribe,"Ah Omar, you will never get the respect that you truly deserve. The man is one of the all-time greatest professional athletes in my opinion, also a good all-around guy. If you were a Tribe fan back in the golden era of the 90s, you will truly appreciate this book. It's a fun read. Hall of Fame baby!!"
5,Great Read!,"This book has all kinds of good inside stuff about players like AlbertBelle and Manny Ramirez. It's not only a great read for hard-core baseball fans, but casual fans will like it, too, because Omar has an amazing life off the field. He's a serious painter, does standup comedy, designs his own clothing, plays paintball, etc., etc. The color photos are awesome, too. Best sports book I've seen in years"
3,"They were good, but I like the dutch chocolate ones better.","When I ran out of the dutch chocolate ones, I decided to try the plain coconut ones. Although they also were non-dairy, individually wrapped and certified kosher, they were a little grainier. They were still good, but I like the chocolate ones a little better."
4,"Nice twofer, but know what you're getting","If you can still find Rhino's separate reissue of Undertow, pick that up as well - it has 3 bonus tracks not found here.But since this twofer is the only place you can find 'Clouds Across The Sun,' it's still not a bad bet."
5,Groundbreaking,"An excellent example, if not THE example, of the Seattle sound. Unfortunately, the record industry destroyed that sound and its originality. Pearl Jam wandered from their roots, and their following albums are subdued and confusing. Ten is rock-solid, rock-n-roll. This is a great album. If you like great rock/grunge, get Ten...skip the rest of their discography."
3,Pretty impressive but overated.,"Pearl Jam have musically have much better albums than this.""Binural"" ""No Code"" ""Yield"" even ""Riot Act"" is much nicer on the whole. Although many complain about Pearl Jam losing it with Vitolagy and ending after VS.So what, you'd rather hear another 5 albums of the same style of music.Then you;d be saying, why don't they do something different, its just really really stupid.There are some great guitar playing, Mike McCready is really good, but c'mon, its not that astounding.And its kind of a bit sleepy at times too.Best bits ""Once"" ""Even Flow"" ""Black"".Nirvana being compared to Pearl Jam, I don't see the point.Oh and this is not Grunge!!! - its called ""music""."
2,Interesting Deluxe Edition with Remix - BAD sound quality.,"Just a quick note:Not a big fan of Pearl Jam but willing to give this ""classic"" a go recently. Song not bad, appreciate the work they put in for the remixed tracks... Can't say which (remaster vs. remix) I prefer.BAD part: These CD's are a sad example of the nasty loudness wars ([...]). They sound horribly compressed and certain parts distorted on high quality sound systems. Perhaps not a big issue with grunge but still wrong is wrong.Easily 5/5 if they allowed the album to breathe with full dynamics. As it stands - 2/5 since audio quality ESSENTIAL for a remaster.."
2,"DVD Review: ""Oceans"" Edited, Missing ""Rockin' in the Free World""","This DVD is a revisionist version of reality. ""Oceans"" has been edited to remove Eddie's ex-girlfriend's name and there's an entire song missing, an amazing rendition of ""Rockin' In The Free World"" written by Neil Young.So many fans have waited years for this performance to come out on DVD. Thanks for nothing. I'll stick to my bootleg copy with the TCR timer; suggest you save your hard earned money and do the same."
5,I give Ten a ten,"Ten is an amazingly awesome CD. I do not know how anyone can say they hate Pearl Jam. I'm sure everyone who grew up in the rap generation and has no taste for good music probably hates Pearl Jam, but I don't see how that's possible. To me, Pearl Jam is real. This album has all emotions. They have songs about love, losing love, world issues, personal struggle...They have it all. Unlike the music today, Pearl Jam mostly write there songs as a part of a story. Like Vitalogy and Vs., Ten is mostly about Eddy Vedder's childhood and how hard he had it.I love this album because it has it all. It has meaningful lyrics, great sounds, and incredibly awesome guitar solos. Personally, my favorite solo is at the end of Alive. A lot of people like the music the like for the way it sounds, without bothering to listen to the lyrics. Although Pearl Jam produces a great sound, their lyrics mean so much more and that's what it is all about."
5,Best Pearl Jam CD. Ever,"Back in the early 90s this was one of the best cds out there. Now in the new millenium this is one of the best cds ever. Pearl Jam found the right formula for success, and captured raw energy that they have yet to duplicate. Maybe the reason for the success of the album is how one can emphasis with Vedder's lyrics. If you don't own this cd and you like rock, you owe it to yourself to pick it up."
5,The best grunge band with out a dout.,"This cd is perfection in every way. It displays great vocals, great music, and pure emotional lyrics. The best song by far is ""black"" this is one of those rare cds that you can listen over and over and never get sick of. If you like Nirvana or if you like Soundgarden try ""Temple of dog"" (its pj and soundgarden together) It perfect for Rock fans. A great cd and its in no way over rated."
5,Can't we all just get along??,"What is the matter here. Look its a great PEARL JAM ALBUM. Not a test to see if you like all bands, or if your a rasist. Hell I HATE pointless rap and r&b music, but my black roommate doesn't. Does that make me a rasist. For all you REAL music lovers here, love this music because when you get down to it, its a cut from the same mold as other truely original music bands from Incubus, to Dave Matthews. Enjoy."
2,"Some good songs, but you have to look hard to find them","In the tradition of bands reviving music styles popularized in the '70's, we have PEARL JAM. This album is not very good, but the three video hits ""ALIVE"" ""EVEN FLOW"" and ""JEREMY"" are all good quality songs and make the listener want to replay. So, I would only be able to recommend this to fans of the band."
2,the only record by them i like,this group was way overrated.aside from the jim morrision comparisions of eddie veddar to there isn't much substance to anything they do.take eddie away and you might have a good lounge act and that's pushing it.
3,I don't get the whole re-mastered thing on cd.,"Ok, I love PEARL JAM but this set is for Die hard fans only!!!!!!! because if you already own "" TEN "" then there is no reason to spend $27.00 bucks on this set. I bought this set for 2 reasons, 1. I have always wanted the Unplugged show on dvd since I first show it on MTV years ago and 2. I thought the so called re-mix cd was like oh ya know re-mixed songs! If you play the old version of ""TEN"" and then the new re-mastered version and then the "" re-mixed"" version there is no real differnce. maybe if you sat in your livingroom with Eddie Vedder and asked him he might be able to tell you.lol. really. I guess the re-mixed version sounds maybe a little tiny bit different but if you didn't know you would simply think it's the same cd. Like I said FOR DIEHARD FANS ONLY.!! The packaging is really nice, but that's about it. So, now i have 3 copies of ""TEN"". The dvd is awesome BTW."
1,Let's be honest here....,"Back in 1991, when I was 14 I bought this album, and thought that Pearl Jam were the coolest thing around. ELEVEN YEARS LATER, and I can see this CD for what it truly is, an uninspired, bland commercial pop knock-off.Songs like ""Alive"" and ""Even Flow"" have dated horribly in the past decade, while stiff like ""Jeremy"" was considered MTV-fluff even back then. If you didn't fall for the hype (like me) and wasted your money on this, then good for you. Avoid at all costs."
1,Avoid anything Pear Jam,"""Ten"" is one of the most unoriginal albums ever written...""Alive"", ""Ten"",""Black"",(One word titles,how clever) are the most boring songs I have ever heard, lyrically and musically. A down point in American music"
1,Beyond boring,"Not only does ""Ten"" have the worst album cover in the history of rock n' roll, it has some of most boring songs ever written. The songs aren't bad, but utterly uninteresting and are the essence of boring. I'm completely dumbfounded by their success. When Nirvana, Soundgarden and even Mudhoney were creating a sludgy heavy metal punk pop sound known as grunge, Pearl Jam shows up and while supposedly being part of this group, just play hard rock music, that sounds more inspired by Aerosmith than Black Flag. Eddie Vedder has an interesting voice at best, but can't compete with the emotional intensity of Kurt Cobain or the bluesy voice of Chris Cornell. As for the rest of the band, none of them left enough of an impression on me for me to even remember their names. Basically, Pearl Jam brought the dinosaurs back to life. Their influence on other artists is profound as well, creating other similar sounding boring bands like Stone Temple Pilots, Candlebox and Silverchair."
2,pearl jam ...maybe for free,"i cant believe the hype i've heard about Pearl Jam....i mean dont get me wrong here, they make good music but doesnt it seem a little strange that they sound just like Creed and even Silverchair back in the day. now thoses bands have talent and originality. so if your thinking of buying Ten or any other Pearl Jam album, i would suggest Creed's Human Clay instead. God Bless."
1,"Pearl Jam ?? Listen Zeppelin, Floyd, Hendrix, Jeff Beck, etc","If you like the good music, and you are a real musician don't buy this !"
1,Most.Overated.Album.Ever,"I don't understand why people like this album which is the musical equivalent of watching the OC. First of all Eddie Vedders voice sounds like the son of a bullfrog on crack and toni braxton and ruins any song that has a decent guitar riff. People love to overate this band because they didn't make videos or release singles, but Metallica did that before them and actually made good music. I like grunge but am not one of those people who hates commercial music. I listened to Guns N' Roses Motley Crue and Van Halen in the 80's and early 90's and I still like their older albums. I don't judge an album by its commercial accessability but on how good the music is. And Nirvana and Soundgarden are both better than this s**t. The only good songs on this album are Once and Even Flow so just download those off the internet and forget this album."
5,What can I say?,"It helped make grunge what grunge is.That is, great.Pearl Jam's debut is one of the best debuts of all time IMO. With songs 1-6 being my favorites. Even Flow and Once are my favorites all in all, they have Eddie with a great display of vocal range in these songs. This was the first album in a great career of a band."
4,the one good pearl jam album,"I am not a fan of pj as i liked only this album from them.I am more a fan of alice in chains and soundgarden from the grunge era.still this album has some nice tracks like alive,evenflow,black and jeremy and is worth having in your cd collection along with facelift and dirt from alice in chains."
1,Not The Good Grunge I was Hopein' 4!!,"What is down?? First off I love grunge rock, its dark brooding power cords define my tortured life and I love playing it on a sunny day while I golf with friends at the country club. Anyhoo, a friend told me I shood check out Pearl Jam and said I should play their new one they just putt out with a dvd called ""10"". Wow, this was nothing like the good grunge bands, the singer is indescipherable, the guitarists play no good memorable rifts, and the drumber is just hitting old peanut butter cans, gross!! LOOK People, stick with TRU grunge bands, you know bands like Puddle Of Mudd, Nickleback, Theory Of A Deadman, 3 Days Grace, Default and Mudvayne. Go Bengals, 2009 Football Champs, Who-Dey!!"
1,They wish they were Nickelback or Creed.,"Yeah yeah, Pearl Jam may have came out first...but Creed and Nickelback sound hell of a lot better. Plus, Pearl Jam.. what a dumb name! And the lyrics/vocals are a complete failure to the brilliance of modern rock heroes Chad Kroeger and Fred Durst.BTW: 'Jeremy' is a terrible song!"
5,Debut?,when i first got into pearl jam it was beacuse of wishlist(yeild). I got the cd and built a collection from there. i have all their cds (excluding imports) and i'd have to say TEN is there best. whatever mood your in TEN is there. if you haven't bought this cd atleast listen to it. if you don't have it it's obvious your friends don't have it. get it at a library or a used cd store (CD WHAREHOUSE is excellent). this cd will rock you house and car forever.
5,Best album of 1991,"And yes you read that correctly, NOT Nevermind, which certainly has its place in music history but not nearly as good as Ten. But as far as debuts go, perhaps one of the best ever. Right up there with Appetite For Destruction and Definatley Maybe. Eddie Vedder captivates right from the beginning with his dark often brooding lyrics with a voice that could NEVER be duplicated no matter how many people try to copy it(Scott Stapp, i'm looking at you) but for me, the best song on this album is hands down ""Alive"", truly a piece of rock n' roll greatness with Vedder growling more passionate than ever, with incredible lyrics to boot ""Son ohh she said, have i got a little story for you, what you thought was your daddy, was nothing but a...while you were sitting home alone at age 13, your real daddy was dyin', sorry you didn't see him, but i'm glad we talked"" truly amazing with an excellent chorus. Best CD of 1991, a must own."
3,Not a Pearl Jam fan,"there is 2 reasons i gave this album 3 stars. 1.It helped make grunge 2. becasue of the songs ""alive"" and ""black"". im not a pearl jam fan i only like 5 songs that they ever wrote."
4,Classic 90's Grunge album. Production style is a bit muddy,"This is a terrific album with hits that I'm sure if you were alive in the 90s and not living in a cave you've heard. The production style is kind of rough and gives it a little bit of a live feel, which some people will undoubtedly like. I personally prefer a crisper, studio sound, and thus I can only give it 4/5 stars. Still a great album, and because it was to popular, dirt cheap to pick up used. Well worth it in my opinion."
4,"good packaging, but what about Dave Abbruzzese?","I thought this was a pretty good set, however I think a few things are missing from the unplugged show though. My only real complaint about the set is the fact that on the dvd it only shows Eddie, Stone, Jeff and Mike on the dvd menu, what about Dave Abbruzzese? I kinda thought that was pretty rude, he was an awesome drummer and had a lot of input in the band.I noticed they also blanked him on the photos contained in rearview mirror (the best of) Anyway the remix cd was cool and it was awesome to see unplugged on dvd even if it has been cut."
2,"Weak,","I'll get straight to the point. The musicianship is absolutely atrocious: aside from a few solos, the guitarists sound like they can't play at all. The drumming is unbearably simple (to me anyway) David Grohl (sp?) who used to drum in Nirvana can slaughter him without trying. Eddie Vedder can barely sing, although it is nice that he has influenced much better vocalists such as Aaron Lewis (Staind) and (but not limited to) Scoot Ward (Cold). With poor production, the music is boring to listen to. The lyrics seem to be most of the focus in praise for this, but I say nonsense unto you. Lyrics are profane and try too hard to be arty or thought-provoking.I will conclude by saying that if you wan't to hear anything average from Pearl Jam, try their ""underground"" followup to this. There is more straight rock in it and not as many MTV cliches. peace..."
3,Not quite a NEVERMIND,"Well, I have to give credit to Pearl Jam who helped the early 90's grunge movement tremendously, and I do like them. However, this is NOT to be compared with Nirvana's NEVERMIND. Although TEN did, later on, outsell NEVERMIND, Nirvana's greatest is recognised as the album that was the biggest part of the grunge movement. And it was. Because it was the best record to come out of the grunge movement. Songs like ""Smells like Teen Spirit"" molded a generation, and I seriously recomend both NEVERMIND and IN UTERO instead of TEN. Actually, I would recomend MELLON COLLIE AND THE INFINITE SADNESS above TEN also. But still not a bad CD and a big part of grunge."
2,Grunge...my turn to talk,"There r a few things Id like to say.Fred Durst guy,your a retart.Thos bands u said came out over a decade after the real grunge,dumb****...Ill admit this albums alright but pearl jam`s later stuff isn`t grunge,its rich kid music.Nirvana used simple catchy chords and created a fanbase that were inspired to try rock.By the way,ALICE IN CHAINS ARE THE BEST GRUNGE!!!THERE ORIGINAL.Anyway,so nirvana were better.They didnt play with good guitars and be all fancy like pearl jam.Nirvana dude,IM WITH YA!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Not really nexessary,"To be treated with a re-release of Ten which of coarse is not as good as the origional which is also packaged in here (thank god) then to have an album like Backspacer on the horizion is strange. Hearing TEN then listening to Backspacer are like listening to two totally different bands. The Pearl Jam performing TEN is good the Pearl Jam on Backspacer sucks and sounds like radio freiendly dated garbage. But overall it's a good package, the origional mix is much better than the new one and the DVD is decent. This is the only Pearl Jam album worth buying."
1,The most boring band in recent history. Eddie Vedder is a terrible singer.,"Why 1 star, you say? Isn't this album a grunge classic? Well, no. What's the point of having droopy, depressed, songs? Isn't music supposed to be energetic and full of life?You know how a balloon stuck on the ceiling looks? Like it's just floating around, waiting to be popped by the fan? That's how most of the songs on Ten sound.Even the catchy songs on this album are ruined by Eddie Vedder's singing. Plain and simple, he should have stuck to his day job. You especially realize how bad he is when you compare him to a REAL lead singer like Robert Plant or Ozzy. He can't even hold a microphone to David Coverdale, who is not exactly one of rock's immortals.Once and Why Go are okay, but otherwise, hold your nose when you walk by this album in the store.Signing off,Mike"
1,"dung album, dung band","Can't help but think about toliet paper when a song of theirs comes on...they do play to the media...it's their style...it gives them ""hits."" Listen to the Clash for the real thing."
1,Pearl Jam- Animal,"Eddie Vedder, wrap it up pal. I've heard of glam rock, but lamb rock? eeeeeeoooooramaramagam dama gama gam gam a yeaahhh. I wish this guy would get a real job like working at McDonalds. Your 15 seconds are up. I'll see you on VH1's where are they now."
1,This is punk not grunge.,"Pearl jam is the most overrated band i've ever heard of. They didn't invent grunge. Alice in chains invented grunge, and people think Nirvana invented it. Grunge really Started when Alice in chains released Facelift. Then poser bands like PEARL JAM came along and made fools of themselves. Many grunge bands sound like punk like Pearl jam and Nirvana. I even looked up grunge and it said it sounded like punk and heavy metal. Peral jam is nothing but punk. If you want really want real grunge, get Albums from Alice in chains such as Facelift and Dirt. Your missing out on this poser band."
4,Best debut album ever!,"Along with Appetite for Destruction this is the best debut album ever!I can't get out off my mind this words ""I know someday you'll have a beautiful life, I know you'll be a star in somebody else's sky, but why, why, why can't it be, why can't it be mine."
3,"great record, not perfect though","I've been a Pearl jam fan since i heard alive on the radio 13 years ago (i think) and i really consider Pearl Jam an excellent band, and Ten is an icon, but still i can't listen to the record all over without skiping songs, this album is great but its not perfect because a couple of songs, oceans and once, are really long and boring, but songs like even flow, jeremy, black, and alive kinda make it up for them, anyway this is not grunge.. pearl jam is no grunge band...whcih does not make them bad a t all, this record is too polished i guess, it sounds too clean for grunge.but it's a must for any good rock fan anyway, although i'd recomend Vitalogy first, its much better than ten"
5,A monumental classic from the grunge era,"Ten is one of the albums that doesn't lose its power even after the musical movement is was a part of has long since faded. Drawing inspiration from classic rock while expounding a uniquely 90's attitude, its rousing sound resonates with as much emotion today as it did when it came out over a decade ago. Pearl Jam has never been afraid to grapple with weighty issues such as homelessness, youth violence, and isolation, and Ten showcases their heavy social conscence. But the album's deep lyrical subject matter only adds to the emotional strength of the music, creating a album that is earnest and intensely moving. Pearl Jam would go on to create other phenomenal albums, but Ten will always have a special place as the definitive Pearl Jam masterwork."
5,Ten. You can say everything and nothing about this cd.,"From the weee age of 9 I have been listening to pearl jam as well nirvana, sound garden, nin, and stp. Out of all it is very hard to say which i like the most. But when it comes to favorite cd it is most certainly Ten. This album expresses every emotion possible. If you noticed the title and wondered huh? well it is simple. if a person has not heard ten then you can tell them so much about it and why they should get it. If you are with some one who has heard ten then you need not say nothing they already know. It is not thier best cd because well their cds are all difrent with a difrent emotion but this is one you can put and have everything disapear. If you own any pj cds and don't have this one, get it now! if you ever get the chance to see them live pray the play ten because it will be the best damn show you ever seen. Trust me, i've seen all their shows."
5,"I got my hand in my pocket so determined, discrete, I pray..","The name is Ten, but I can only give it 5 Stars.. In 1991, the world was given it's first taste of a band that has influenced music of the 90's more than any other band. Pearl jam's debut album is jam-packed with some of the most recognizable song's in the pearl jam library. This album is first sample the amazing, lyric-filled brain of Ed Vedder that has given all pearl jam albums a reputation for greatness that will surely stand the test of time. Songs like Jeremy and Black are well known all over the world and are still favorites of even the die-hard pearl jam fans like myself. I've always thought that you're not a true pearl jam fan unless you know the song Once, word for word. This was one of the first cd's I ever bought, and it should definatley be a part of everyones cd library even if you're not a die-hard pearl jam fan. Get this CD, and ya never know, maybe you'll become the next die-hard fan :)"
5,Excellent vinyl sound quality,"This review is not about the music, but about the 180 gram vinyl quality. I also own the MP3 version and CD and the vinyl is a perfect example of the sound quality that you can get from vinyl and an okay sound system. I'd highly recommend this release!"
5,Better than the U.S. Release,"If you thought the US version was good, the Beatles song will blow you away. If you aren't familiar with it, its from the Let it Be album (also great). However this should only be for Pearl Jam hardcores or those willing to spend a little extra money. Seems like double the price is too steep for one song, but I think it was worth it."
4,important grunge album,"this cd is one of the best of the early 90's. it has great songs on it such as jeremy, alive, once, even flow and why go. this CD was PJ's first, and became very popular a year after it was first released. this is a great CD and i highly reccomend it to anyone who likes AIC, nirvana, or soundgarden."
5,Greatest album of gen. X,What can be said? This album broke out pearl jam into the emmerging world of grunge. It was another blow to hair-bands and power-balads.Every track on this album is well done. The lyrics are memorable. The guitar work is masterful. This is a must have album for anyone that likes rock.
4,Pearl Jam's best album,"This is by far the best Pearl Jam album. I don't have to pick the best songs to listen, they all have the same unique quality. Still, the band had very low sense of perfection in those days, making the live performances the real enjoyment of the fans. If you compare Ten with Yield, for example, it's very easy to see the difference. Ten is pure talent."
3,"Good, but overrated by you popular radio fans....","easily P.J.'s worst album, not in terms of sales obviously but in the sheer interest it creates...of course those who hopped on the post-grunge/pearl jam alt. scene like it, they like korn and whatnot now...but i'd like to think that any fan of pearl jam (note: NOT pearl jam's hit songs per say) realizes this is an over-slick glossy debut that got shoddy production...it's good, but pj only got better (yes, that includes no code)...anyways, in conclusion, you want to know a true pj fan from a ""jeremy/even flow bandwagon rider"", just ask which is better, yield or ten..."
2,"Weak,","I'll get straight to the point. The musicianship is absolutely atrocious: aside from a few solos, the guitarists sound like they can't play at all. The drumming is unbearably simple. David Grohl who used to drum in Nirvana can slaughter this drummer without trying. Eddie Vedder can barely sing, although it is nice that he has influenced much better vocalists such as Aaron Lewis (Staind) and Scoot Ward (Cold). With poor production, the music is boring to listen to. The lyrics seem to be most of the focus in praise for this, but I say nonsense unto you. Lyrics are profane and try too hard to be arty or thought-provoking.I will conclude by saying that if you wan't to hear anything average from Pearl Jam, try their ""underground"" followup to this. There is more straight rock in it and not as many MTV cliches."
2,Pearl Jams worst.,"Pearl Jams ten is the most overated album of all time.Awful really, don't buy it.Pearl Jams first album is ""Binuaral.""""Ten, Vs, Vitolagy, No code and Yield are awful albums and are very sloppy and patchy. The dreadful grunge era of the early 90s and later on - erff - it makes me cringe just to think about it. Awful."
2,Overhyped...,"This must go down as one of the most overrated albums of all time. I picked it up a couple of years back, thinking that while it couldn't possibly be as good as people said it was, it'd provide a good listen. How wrong I was. Listening to Pearl Jam is like being hit over the head repeatedly with pieces of foam. 'Ten' is full of bluster and little substance. 'Oceans' is my personal favourite on the album, its atmospheric and works really well, but theres little else of note. 'Even Flow' isn't so good without that great video... Or 'Jeremy'... Once again, the masses worship an album that really doesnt deserve worship. If you're into real music, avoid this. As far as grunge is concerned, Soundgarden were a far superior band. Nirvana too. Avoid 'Ten'."
2,The best Pearl Jam album.,"This was Pearl Jam's only good album and it's nothing stellar. Jermey is pretty good, Deep is a good song, Evenflow is good, Why Go is good the rest and every album after were just garbage, and Backspacer will prove that point perfectly if anyone has heard it yet, it's total puke. Nirvana, Soundgarden and Alice In Chains thats grunge, and even more so than grunge crap it's awesome music. Pearl Jam are posers."
2,who wants this?,jeremy is the only good song in this album...oh wait deep is too! i think the lyrics could have been better! they come from seattle? there's better band there!
1,Pearl Jam wants your money!,"Pearl Jam are clearly a band with excellent business sense. Their income streams include millions of albums sold, thousands of sold out concerts, hundreds of self-released official live bootlegs and now a re-release of their highest selling album. Excellent money-making skills but probably not in line with their ideology as a band of the people. They got rid of their best drummer Dave Abruzzesse because he liked the rock star life too much. What a shame, he would have fit in perfectly with their plan now and they would have made better albums.The only reason to get this package is the MTV unplugged concert which should have been released years ago anyway. Another cash grab. It's a nostalgia trip now because Pearl Jam are not that band anymore."
1,TERRIBLE,"this is the worst piece of crap ever. i HATE pearl jam. they are complete poseurs off of nirvana and soundgarden. they are so bad i cant even explain. the guitars sound like a baby crying, and eddie vedder's voice sounds like....well it sounds like a baby cry as well. if you want REAL grunge, check out stone temple pilots, nirvana, soundgarden, alice in chains, and default. DOWN WITH PEARL HAM!"
1,I told you so,"Pearl Jam ruled the world. And this album was so great, and Eddie Vedder was such a genious. And now its about 10 years later and this album sounds terrible because its too emotional. The best thing about ""grudge"" music was apathy, and this record cares too much. The guitar solos are too virtuous, and the fact that the album cover is pink always bothered me. In fact, what is the band doing, on that album cover? The Pearl Jam has made several bad decisions over the years. I recommend listening to maroon 9, stained, and lincoln park, instead."
2,more awful grunge rock music,"likely to rank amongst the most overrate albums ever...just check out Classic Rock magazine...when these guys came out everybody was wandering what`s the deal here...poor technique, a frontman who thinks he is JMorrison reborn...sad stuff. Unfortunately grunge rock took over and brought a lost decade of bad music but things fianlly changed and 10, 20, 30 years from now nobody will care about these boring bands out of Washington state, all the while the world is re-discovering what real rock music is. What goes around comes around!!"
3,IT WAS WORTH FIVE STARS BACK IN 1992,"Ten. The album that launched a musical of force of such enormity, it is unstoppable. Who knew that Pearl Jam would be the last surviving band from the grunge era still standing, touring, and making tons of coin. That said, we have this reissue of the classic Ten album. Like with many reissues, get this one if you can't find your original copy of Ten. Or, get it if you are slightly curious. In any case, the DVD of the unplugged performance is the only reason to get this reissue. Apart from that, Pearl Jam is just cashing in (like so many bands) on their back-catalogue."
4,very,very dark & bleak vision of the world.. eddie's no poet but he does have intensity and conviction and one of the best voices around.
4,"""Ten by Pearl Jam"" 3.5 out of 5 stars","I have to admit I hated this when it first came out but it did grow on me over time. I prefer their second release Vs. to this myself and also prefer bands like STP and Alice in Chains over Pearl Jam. This is a good to great album but I do think it is somewhat overrated. I think the song writing is fine, its the vocals that bug me. I seen another review where the reviewer talks about the garbled vocals, I have to agree."
5,"unquestionably, one of the greatest albums of all time","i can't say enough about this album, and this band. every song is amazing, passionate, explosive, and meaningful. in a world full of rip-off pop music, pearl jam is a band that does not compromise and stands alone."
5,Saying its great is the understatement of the century!!!!!!!,"Anyone with half a brain has to love Pearl Jam. I can't even bring myself to ranking this album with any others 'cause they're all so f**king great. It never leaves my CD player. The lyrics are all so meaningful and theres a song for every situation. I can always refer to a pearl Jam song if a situation arises and I sound like a genious. I love that I never have to skip a song . The songs have such a great sound like how Oceans mkes me feel as if I'm underwater. Black, Porch, Alive, Release, and Jeremy have the most passion and the greatest lyrics i've ever heard. I sing them all the time. In short, people who don't like PJ should be sent to Poland where they can polka w/o fear of being beaten."
5,You know....,"I remember when Pearl Jam was a band. On ""Ten"" you could tell they were a group of musicians who wrote their songs by jamming. After this album they became The Eddie Vedder Experience. For a band that showed unlimited promise, it all went downhill from here. But when you consider the album that this is, there was no other direction to go."
3,3 for ten,"The most popular album by a band I really like isn't exactly my favorite but what can you do? huh? Stop comparing Nirvana to pearl jam and then liking the other and then hating the other, Nirvana and PJ are very very different, Nirvana had a more punkish sound and then pearl Jam was very stadium-like. Another band who you can't compare to is Soundgarden, they are a metal band for people who don't even like metal. The album is not too shabby but personally i think the early 90s grunge scene got too out of hand and made a few bands turn into successful giants and rock gods and then by 1994 they were unknown. If I were to choose a good PJ album stick with the later stuff, they got more musically talented and it's evident, Vs. is a tad better than Ten but it has a lot of that sound, Vitalogy, No Code, and Binaural make PJ look very good though, if you were to buy a PJ album just to see where PJ started buy this, but to get introduced to the band, start with the later stuff."
5,Pearl Jam's best album ever.,"When I looked at spin magazine's list of 50 greatest bands of all time, it said that Pearl Jam's classic album is Vitalogy. I would like to say that Vitalogy is one of the [worst] albums I've heard in a long time. Ten is like 15 times better than Vitalogy. Spin magazine don't know what ... their talking about. This is one of the best albums of the 90's. It's full of lively songs with great guitar solos and vocals. Vitalogy contains [bad] guitar riffs, no solos bad vocals and lyrics, oh what the [heck], the album [stinks] major time.Ten is just phenomanal. It really showed how talented these dudes really are. It's just too bad they wasted all of it on [bad] albums like Vitalogy and Yield. So if you love grunge and you don't have this outstanding album, you need someone to give you a swift kick in the [butt]."
5,Pearl Jam's best,"This debut album by Pearl Jam will always be my personal favorite Pearl Jam CD.This was right next to Nirvana's NEVERMIND as the two top Grunge albums of the early 90's.Every song on this album rocks.I love the the slow haunting intro to Once and how that same intro,which turns into the outro,closes out the album.If you never heard any of Pearl Jam's music,you should pick this up.It's a great introduction to a great band."
4,Good starter album for new PJ fans,If you want to know what PJ use to be about then purchase this album. This is when they were pretty wild. Everything about their sound was aggressive. This is when they were considered grunge and the press thought they were from Seattle ha!The album sounds great oveall. My only complaint would be the drums could have more ambience to them. They sound a little whimpy to me. This album should be remastered and re-released in a digipak with more photos from that era. For now we all can enjoy this release.
5,Come on!!!,"Nirvana - Great bandPearl Jam - great bandBoth bands were/are exceptional on what they did/do! It seems like some Nirvana fans have a hard time dealing with the fact that pearl jam actually was bigger! If Eddie committed the suicide instead of Kurt, then Eddie would be a bigger icon in Rock history today than what Kurt is. Deal with it!!!"
5,"dirty frank, give it away now","I love this album, you have to have a live version of alive if you are a true pj fan, but somethings weird... just listen to dirty frank, then listen to ""give it away"" by the red hot chili peppers, hmmm..."
5,pearl jam,"this is a great CD, and a album that I have missed listening to over the years. I had this poster on my wall when I was younger, thanks for the cool offer."
2,'quoter' has it right - Alive is messed up on the remastered disc,"I'm sorry, but how can you 'remaster' a cd and fudge up one of the most popular singles....the single that essentially catapulted PJ into the stratosphere? I listened to 'Alive' on headphones and the right channel drops out from :27-1:19...you can actually hear it come back in! What is with that? My original cd from 1991 didn't have that issue and I would think that the Quality Control folks at Sony would've caught something so blatant.This is one of the greatest debuts of all time. It's a shame they didn't treat it as such. 10 stars for the album itself. 2 stars for the remaster and lack of attention to detail."
5,Listen up...,"Ok. When reviewing Pearl Jam a lot of you tend to compare them with Nirvana, and the rest of you insist on calling them sellouts. Let's look at the facts. Ten is one of the best selling albums of all time. It is because it is one of the most musically astounding albums ever made. There isn't anything wrong with this. Pearl Jam didn't sellout and they shouldn't be compared to Nirvana or any band. Is everyone who makes a great rock album that sells a lot of money considered a sellout? So does this mean they should strive for mediocrity just so they don't sell out? Pearl Jam is a great band who makes great music. They are artists and that's how they should be treated. Ten is a great album. It was a classic from the day it came out. Instead of bashing success we should all learn to open our minds a little and embrace it. More power to them for creating a classic rock & roll album. Hopefully more bands can follow this example."
5,Still the greatest...,"The version of SOLAT is as good as the ""original"" released from Singles. A wonderful revisitation of the last great rock album."
4,A solid debut,"Though I much prefer ""Vs"" to this, ""Ten"" is still a solid album. The only problem I have with it is that I love a few of the songs so much that the rest of the songs seem inferior and I can't listen to it straight through. Best songs: Black, Alive, Jeremy, Once, Garden."
5,A CLASSIC MASTER PIECE!,"WHAT CAN I SAY THAT HASN'T ALREADY BEEN SAID ABOUT THIS GEM OF AN ALBUM?!?! IT IS TRUE..""PEARL JAM'S TEN"" DEFINED THE 90'S GRUNGE ERA. ALTHOUGH MOST PEOPLE WILL CONSIDER ""NIRVANA"" TO BE THE BIGGEST BAND TO COME OUT OF THE 90'S..MY VOTE GOES TO PEARL JAM. I LIKED KURT COBAIN AND NIRVANA..BUT THEY NEVER TOUCHED ME..THEY NEVER SPOKE FOR AND WITH ME THE WAY PEARL JAM DID!! SONGS LIKE ""BLACK(THIS SONG STILL HUNTS ME), ALIVE, EVEN FLOW, GARDEN, ONCE, RELEASE ME(THIS SPOKE FOR SO MANY OF US. HOW MANY TIMES HAVE WE WISHED FOR OUR ""DEMONS"" TO RELEASE US?) PORCH AND OCEANS"" COULD NEVER BE DUPLICATED!! THESE SONGS HELPED ME THRU COLLEGE AND THEY STILL CARRY ME TODAY!! WHEN PEOPLE ASK ME TO NAME MY TOP 10 ALBUMS OF ALL TIME..""PEARL JAM'S TEN"" STILL COMES OUT AT THE TOP OF MY LIST""!!! A++++++++++++++++"
5,definitely a classic!,"this cd helped define the 1990's. songs like Porch, Jeremy, and Black will forever be remembered for giving music a new direction. This is a cd that you purchase several times because you wear it out."
4,"Too Much Hype, BUT good Debut","Ten, is to me, by far, WAYYY overrated. WIth that said, I CAN say it was a great debut. I mean, the releases were awesome, and Once, and MAYBE Black, which I am sure was NOT a release is great too. The other songs didnt seem to approach me as good as the listed ones here. Yet, if they had to put Yellow Ledbetter and Footsteps on here, and took off some of the filler towards the end. Not bad, I wouldnt pay anything over $15.00 for it,Try ""VS"" instead. Their Masterpiece"
3,"ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz......Wha? Oh, I fell asleep there, from listening to this.","This is pretty good, but at times, it's so friggin boring! Nevermind, Superunknown and Dirt are better."
3,The start of a truly great band,"I believe Pearl Jam has evolved into a great band, and that Eddie Vedder is a fantastic artist and performer. That said, this first album showed promise but is nowhere near the quality of what was soon to come. To me, they really came into their own with Vitalogy and continue to make fantastic records to this day. I loved this album at the time, and still enjoy much of it now, but it sounds like a band that hasn't quite figured out it out yet (both musically and artistically)."
2,radio friendly grunge,"right first off a disclaimer i'm a huge fan of pearl jam i love there second album ""vs"" a classic i just don't see the point in everyone saying this is the only pearl jam ""grunge"" classic when really is pretty lame affair so they had there foot on the distotion pedal more than there over-rated whiney companions ""nirvana"" but hell it doesn't make what they do good, it fact if you had asked me a year ago what album was my favorite by pearl jam i would of said this..but as i grew so did my variety in taste and i went to there second album ""vs"" and dis-regarded this with the other grunge albums ""nevermind"" and ""in uetro"" by nirvanaand i went back to soundgarden's ""badmotorfinger"" METAL CLASSICalice in chains ""dirt"" drugged up classicso when i next want to listen to peal jam's ""ten"" i'll dust of the cobwebs and go back to the radio-friendly ticket master protest"
3,YEAH; whatever.,"OK ok, I have been keeping quiet for a long time now. I have always had a hard time understanding the big deal behind PEARL JAM. I know, I know, you people are already steaming at the forehead thinking to yourselves ""HOW DARE HE?"" and I know, that as far as many of you are concerned they were the greatest thing that ever happened to rock, society, and the history of life in general... but I just never really cared about them. I give the debut album TEN three stars, because it ain't bad. It may have a timeless quality to it, but if my baby's mamma tells me one more time about how important these guys were I'm knocking my rating down to a two. Thank You."
3,Nevermind is still BETTER.,"No matter what anyone says or what reason, Nevermind will always be better than Ten. PERIOD."
2,A Little bit better than nevermind,"But I'm still not a grunge fan though, this cd does have some good songs, but As far as I Concerned, I Stopped listening to grunge in 1993, when it got more depressing and ridiculous, Alice in chains is the only thing I Like not this."
3,"Not as good as ""My Own Prison""","Scott Stapp, frontman of Pearl Jam and Creed did pretty good with this release. It's got those songs ""Jeremy"" and ""Black"" on it that were pretty big hits. It's works pretty good, but misses the mark. But Stapp's best work is with his new band ""Creed"". Get ""My Own Prison"" and see the great improvement that has been made from ""Ten""."
1,GREED,"How can it be, in the name of Heaven, that a CD originally released in 1991 can still cost US$ 15??!! Fifteen bucks!! We all know how must cost a virgin CD...I will just get my CD-ROM recorder and make a copy for myesel. As foR Pearl Jam, this band is an American product made for Americans: No substance at all..."
1,Leave the greatest band ever out of this=NIRVANA,Look im not saying that this is a bad album.BUT using record sales to say Pearl Jam is better than NIRVANA is just stupid. Because you know who sold more records than pearl jam Britney Spears so does that make her better than eddie??By the way Pearl Jam rocked from 1991-1993 This Rocks Too
5,Excellent!,"A woman steps away from heartache, into a simple job of helping her relative who runs an investigation service. But soon Emily finds herself confronting a handsome fellow from her past, a man who happens to be the prime suspect in a string of murders. In shot order, she learns to stretch being all she can be!I found this romance, mystery a pleasure to read. I also enjoyedseeing a character portrayed accurately as someone suffering from CFIDS! Apparently, Ms. Carter has a sister who has the immunity illness. Though CFIDS is an aspect of this character, it is not a subject mainlined in this murder romance tale. I highly recommend this book and Ms. Carter's other title: Mirror Mirror."
5,Naturally appealing,"I purchased this book at the Ann Arbor Art Show in October. It was a gift to my daughter (who loves it!) for Christmas, however the book has been passed around the office and among friends. Any nature lover with a creative imagination will fall in love with this book! The photography is wonderful and the words are suitable for the animals they represent. Great gift book for adults and children!!"
5,A Must Read For children and their parents!,"""Stranger in the Woods"" and their other book ""Lost in the Woods"" are the most beautiful children's books I've ever seen! Children will delight in these photographs, and love the little story as will their parents. I am dishearted by one reviewer's comments below. It's a children's book, not the ""great american novel"". This book is simply magical. A treasure beyond any book I've seen recently. Don't hesitate. This book is wonderful and well worth your money as you will keep it forever for it's photographic beauty and enchanting prose."
5,Enjoyable,I already had this book and my kids adore it. I purchased this for my best friend's children when they came to visit from Australia. They had never seen snow before and while they were here in Minnesota they expereineced snow and saw a deer in the yard. Classic story for the northern midwest US.
3,"Wonderful photography, irritating and lackluster text","I came across this book in a thrift store and picked it up to read to my toddlers. Since we don't have snow here in Southern California, I thought it would be a nice way to introduce them to the concept of snow. The photographs are wonderful, but the text is a real disappointment. It is repetitive, and for little kids, it is too wordy. I actually find the story so annoying to read aloud that I make up my own words instead. The kids love looking at the pictures, though.Overall: get it if you like the pictures, but don't count on an inspiring story."
3,Snowflake edition,"I apparently didn't read the description of the ""snowflake edition"" and don't particularly like the cover. I love the story and have been familiar with it for some years so I'm of course pleased with that. The regular photography of the book is outstanding - it's just the cover that I don't like."
2,Doesn't meet the hype...,"This book was been hyped alot at an art show, and I bought the book on faith. When I got home and read it to my kids, it just didn't catch their interest. It is a novel idea to have the book done with photographs, but they are weak and seem to be taken from video. Sams is a noted photographer, so it is too bad the quality is lacking. The text is marginal at best and has no rhythm. There are many other superb holiday books to choose from this year (Eric Carle's latest, Michael Monroe's Christmas Tree book and John Lithgow)...look at those first."
1,Was not pleased with the book,I was not happy with the book because the condition was not at all satisfactory.. The corners looked like a dog had chewed on them and I was very disappointed.
2,not as good as I expected,"The pictures are cute but the story is lacking. i was hoping that there would be something a little deeper to the story bit its really just the title. There's a snow man, animals come and check it out, story over. Not enchanting at all - would have been better if it had just been a picture book and the author left the reader along to think up a story. I guess I don't get into the talking animal movies and this is like that except in written format. Children's stories usually have a mesaage to them so I was at least hoping for that - this doesn't even go that far."
2,a poor book,"This is the kind of book that had potential but missed the mark by quite a bit. The photography looks as though it comes off video, when the author is known to be a quality photographer, I was disappointed that the quality was so low. The story was cute. If the artwork would have been paintings, this might have been a great book. It isn't."
2,not that great,I expected something with a bit more philosophy I guess. The pictures are cute but the story is pretty trite and there's no message per se. I sold it on Amazon after readng it and being disappointed.
1,Avoid,"The heavy-strap design is good, but this product has a poorly designed locking mechansim, so it doesn't stay wrapped around cable, which defeats its purpose. Bungee cord wrapped around the cable would work just as well or better as a hanger. Product needs redesign."
3,"Good, But Mostly Just ""Interesting"".","I count myself among those who believe that the Syd Barrett-era Pink Floyd was their best incarnation; thus, I consider myself a Syd Barrett fan. But I must say that this album is not as good as many would have you believe. I think that Barrett's mystique carries a lot of weight in judging his music. Because he is so strange and fascinating people are more likely to inflate the quality of his music. This album is for the most part pretty mediocre. It is mainly just interesting to hear the last artistic statement of a man who would soon disappear from the world. On that level it is enjoyable, but musically, I suspect that if someone other than Barrett recorded the same tunes the reviews of this album would go down a star or two. Buy The first two Pink Floyd albums instead."
4,I enjoy this music,"I really enjoy this music and I hope that you will purchase it and enjoy it as well. The real reason behind this review is to say to those that rush to heap praise on Syd and denigrate Pink Floyd and/or Roger Waters. Puhleeze wake up, your pretensions are showing."
2,Barrett,"The album cover gives a good indication of the music. Scratchy little insects like a child's drawings. Thanks to the producers the collection of songs hangs together but one has the feeling that Syd isn't really too bothered if the whole thing disintegrates. That's what makes him so special! Lyrics like no-one, (except maybe Beefhart), could pen set to unpredictable music and sung out of tune. Anyone can write a song about Dominoes but Syd did it. You can keep over-production and meaningful words sung by nice, predictable 'musicians'. I prefer my popstars cracked and off the rails. And the good news is he's still alive."
1,Thoroughly confused...,"Let me first say that I am a die hard Floyd fan. I am grateful to Syd Barrett for one thing only...founding the band. I have every CD they made but, the cuts by Syd, well, I just don't understand why anyone would think he is good, let alone great. When I hear a song written by him, I can only feel bad for the man... he was obviously very troubled. The songs written about him are far better than the ones written by him."
2,"Syd, Not even with David could be classified as good.","I have listened to the cd and besides Baby Lemonade, it is a dismal attempt at making a good cd. But then again look back at his past, Madcap was insanely terrible, and thankfully this man did burn out and didn't drag Pink Floyd down with him, despite being the leader of the pack. He can not hold a tune despite all efforts at trying, and the only true and honest thing I can say I liked was that David at least produced a decent sound for him. I sincerely quote that I have wasted money and hopefully a used cd store will restore me with the dollars I wasted on this piece of...."
3,"A must for fans, but not for everyone","For syd barrett, pink floyd fans, this one is a must. The fancy lyrics are still here. ""Wine and Dined"", ""Baby Lemonade"", ""effervencing elephant"", ""Dominoes"", ""love song"" and ""Gigoro Aunt"" are standouts. But, it's not as high standard as ""madcap laughes"" because it's filled by mediocore work like ""masie"", ""rats"", ...etc, and even David gilmour (producer) admitted that his attempt to ""transcribe"" Syd's idea into audible musical form is a murder ... the best of Syd is still ""Piper"" and ""Madcap""... but compare to ""Opel"", this one is still better... for beginners, try the compilation ""octopus"" first then buy ""Madcap"" if you like the former"
3,Madcap gets the last laugh...byBIGRABB,"terrific players (gilmour,wright,jerry shirley{humble pie's drmmer}) aid ""crazy diamond"" syd on his sophomore effort of bittersweet psychedelia. high points on the album, ""rats""(proto glam/punk a la' barrett), maisie(neopsychedelic blues)...must-own for all early floyd/barrettheads!"
3,A little bit overly simplistic,"While it is refreshing to see Dr. Suzuki focus on the positive, the conspiratorial tone of the book and his pervasive suspicion of commerce put me off."
4,"Just for ""Come on in my Kitchen""","I'm not a huge Allman fan but I had to get this for their cover of ""Come on in my Kitchen"", which is great. I love Robert Johnson and the Allman version keeps a good ""feel"" to the song without just copying the older form."
2,OK - If you can stand to watch it,"I suspect that many of the other reviews for this product were written by friends of the dance troupe that produced it. It stars Tyson, who is very charismatic and might have been able to pull off the lengthy, unscripted monologues that make up most of this video if he wasn't exhausted from partying late the night before (a fact to which he makes reference numerous times). He does a good job showing the dance moves, and is a very talented dancer. All in all, you can definitely learn to robot dance from this DVD if you can bear the extremely unprofessional production."
1,Dirt Devil D1,"I also purchased this Vacuum at walmart for $99. Sounded like a good deal and I needed a new vacuum.ProsEasy to empty canister.ConsBulky, heavy (although a healthy adult should have no problems), the power brush doesn't work if you use too much pressure, the filter is spendy to replace, lost suction after about a month of use. Sucking power is horrible and it doesn't pick up hardly anything.Keep in mind I have been using this vacuum for a year now. I have two big dogs, a black lab and a shar pei, and they shed, although not a lot but they do. I also have two small kids. We have a lot of messes, with kids in and out, dogs in and out, my husband works in construction. I wouldn't recommend this vacuum to anyone with kids, or pets. Maybe for a single person or couple with very low traffic in their house."
1,"This vacuum sucks, no pun intended","1. Burning smell emitted upon first use2. Couldn't pick anything up, no suction.Gave up on it after that. Get a Bissell Powertrak Cyclonic. Way better machine for your buck."
1,BLACK NEWSBOY CAP,ON the same day I ordered two newsboy caps from AMAZON one came from Private Island and another of a different color from another vendor. I am extremely disappointed in the cap from Private Island. The fabric is flimsy. the hat is shapeless and the overall quality is unacceptable. To make matters worse it took a long time for the package to reach me. The cap was stuffed into a lightweight plastic mailer unwrapped or protected in any way and was crushed and wrinkled when it arrived. The quality and the performance of the other vendor is far superior. I am sending this back to PRivate ISland in the same way that I received it and I want a refund please.
3,NEWSBOY,"LADY'S THIS HAT IS GREAT EXCEPT FOR ONE THING. IT'S COTTON AND IT'S BLACK IT HOLDS ALOT OF LINT, SO LADY'S KEEP A LINT BRUSH."
3,Ken Clothes,"Ken looks good in this outfit. He has few pieces but, he can look good inthe clothes that were bought here."
5,Absolutely Love These Hats!,"Both hats I ordered came quickly and in great shape, they bothfit perfectly..and oooowie I love them both!In fact, the fedora and the newsboy cap lookeven cooler than pictured..Im all happy;)Seriously a great buying experience for me.."
3,So-So at best,"Great for the price, and it was the perfect look for my female team rocket grunt cosplay. However this hat is not for people with big heads. Overall I have a somewhat small head and this hat is still a snug fit."
2,Ok for price,"It would be okay for a smaller person, maybe as a costume or on occasion, but I don't think it can be used for regular or daily use. The fit is really tight."
2,Small cap,"I don't like it. I was half conscious that this cap was designed for medium head size, like my, but when i fit it, is very uncomfortable. May be, if you are small head size, it will be perfect for you."
3,Cheap price and cheap hat,"The hat was arrived on time, however, the quality of the item is questionable. There were strands of thread sticking out in places, and there was glue on the top from the little button that holds it together. It was also creased due to the way it was shipped. This item was very cheap, however, so I suppose you get what you pay for."
3,Pretty cheap material.,"Honestly, the cap doesn't really look anything like in the picture. I was expecting something much thicker and much more defined in shape. I could get this same hat from Walmart for a fraction of the cost. I shouldn't have bought it and I am sorry that I spent the money to have it shipped to me.The fabric used to make the cap is very light and thin, causing the hat lose it's shape almost completely. The shape is only maintained at all by the elastic band at the base of the cap that pulls it tight around the head leaving space in the main body of the cap. The fabric is sewn together in pie-shaped eighths on the outside and in two round pieces on the inside, making two layers.While I am not really satisfied with the authentic look of the product, the hat can be very nice for those with a lot of hair, or those using them for cosplay.I gave it 3/5 stars because I was hoping for something a bit more authentic looking and a bit thicker/sturdier."
2,dont make hope on the cheap thing,"a it doesn't like the picture shows at all. that make me disappointed .it 's not cotton.ok, i got one lesson dont make hope on the cheap thing"
4,"Simple game, fun for four year old","Honestly, the game is excessively simple, but my son has had a wonderful time playing with it. He loves fighting and he loves Transformers so this game was on his wish list for his birthday. He has been very rough with it and I have had to put legs back on the Transformer figures multiple times. Yet, it seems to still work fine."
4,The sleeper hit of Christmas,"Santa brought this for my 8 year old son. He's had fun with them, but not as much fun as his 5 year old brother. Our little guy has played with these constantly -- even more than the toys he'd specifically asked for. In fact, everyone in our house (including our 10 year old daughter) has had more than a few turns playing this game. (Except we only get to be Optimus Prime -- the 5yo has a monopoly on Megatron). The assembly was simple, the concept easy to understand. I love that the whole game is contained in 2 pieces. One drawback is that it is difficult to knock the robots over - something my sons have remedied by calling out ""freeze"" every so often where they get an open shot. But regardless, the battle rages on in our house!"
3,"Nice, simple but a slight burr on handle","This is simple to install, works well. But in back, near its top edge, there is tiny plastic burr which is sharp. I try not to grip the handle where the burr is. This handle replaced the old original lucite handle, which had apparently cracked into three parts. The former homeowners had cracked the old one and glued it back together, which I hadn't realized. I had thought the lucite was just scratched up. But one day I cleaned the faucet with some rubbing alcohol and the old lucite handle fell apart in pieces. I mention this only because it was surprising that someone could have cracked a lucite knob like this one, installed on a bathroom faucet. Did they drop an anvil on it? Maybe it cracked when someone over-tightened the center screw, but that seems hard to accomplish. In any case, the handle works."
3,good book on a sad life,"This is not an academic's kind of biography,rather it's a book with tremendous feeing towards its subject. The book intends to explore the psyche of both Scott and Zelda. That it succeeds is a testament to the authors empathetic efforts and his reserch. It is also very enjoyable in that it reads like a kind of scholarly National Enquirer."
2,Author has Good Books,It is a good book but not the best book he did write. He is a good author. And most of them are good books.
1,Not what I expected.,"Boring , long confusing sentences. I expected a sequel to The 13th Valley. I was unable to wade through the confusing names."
4,The Secret War of WWII,"I had the pleasure to read this book in order to complete a requirement in my Soviet Political development class in college. The book did take some time to read but was well worth the time. Bradley beautifully put together rare information on the international intelligence trading of WWII. Based on information gleamed by both sides the Allies were able to position troop movements and attacks in order to better attack and defeat the armies of Nazi Germany. Suprisingly it lacks the ""necessary"" chapter on the Jewish extermination camps. All toghether the book is well written and proves an insight on a rarely discussed, or even known about, topic in our nations history."
2,Not complete,"This book wastes half its space on magazine-style ""advice"" to high school seniors. The actual ""guide"" part seems like less than half the text of the book. Catholic colleges are Christian, but they are not included here at all. I don't think Quaker schools are here, either. Most of all, I was disappointed that the information about each college didn't include whether or not the college has a ""dry"" (no alcohol) campus, which is what attracts me most to the idea of a Christian school in the first place."
4,instructional book kids want to read,"This little book is the best ""how to play"" book for kids I've ever seen. Unlike most instructional books, this is written at a level that my 2nd grader can comprehend, but a 7th grader will also enjoy. Each position has its own chapter, as well as one chapter each on base-running (a lost art), pitching, hitting, strategy, and even how to keep score. The artwork is simple pen sketches, nothing dramatic, but good. I am buying this book for every kid on my team, and I believe they will enjoy reading it as much for fun as they will for instruction. It is truly a fun book to read for kids."
2,Dries out too fast!,"It's truefor more than a day, here in the desert. I recommend the Arion case humidifier which lasts months! It is large, so make sure you can fit it in your case."
4,A neglected minor gem!,"You will rarely see this film mentioned in books on cinema history, or on lists of ""top video faves"", but it is a highly enjoyable minor gem which provides an excellent role for the young Tony Curtis. It is the (mostly) true story of Ferdinand Demara Jr., and his amazing career of successfully posing as a U.S. Army officer, a Navy dental surgeon, a prison warden, and several other things which he was not. Solid support is provided by several fine character actors (Edmund O'Brien, Arthur O'Connell, Larry Gates, Raymond Massey, Karl Malden). Slightly overlong, but well worth seeing. The final shot is very funny."
4,Stranger than life fiction turns out to be true!,"Adapted from the novel by Robert Crichton, Tony Curtis portrays the depression era character, Fred Demara. Shortly after graduating from high school Demara flees the poverty stricken streets of Lawrence, Massachusetts and embarks on a thirty five year journey that would not be believable but for the fact that it's true. At the time this film was shot (1960), Curtis was the number one box office attraction in the country. A must see for the historical as well as the entertainment value."
3,Another Interesting Role For Curtis,"Tony Curtis portrays ""Ferdinand Waldo Demara Jr.,"" who faked being a doctor, warden, monk and teacher. When I saw this at the theater almost 50 years ago, I thought it was fascinating. Much older and seeing it on tape about 10-15 years ago, it wasn't as interesting as I had remembered. I guess when you're a kid, everything on the big screen is impressive.Humor helped in this movie, giving it some life here and there as it's a bit slow-moving. However, I've usually found Curtis entertaining to watch, a man who played a lot of interesting characters. I still think he is/was an underrated actor, too.It was nice seeing the main character, although being a fake, still asking for God's help in certain situations, inside knowing he was not doing the right thing. Those parts would be edited out if the film was re-made today. Also, faking being a surgeon is not something to be laughed at, especially if he was doing his operating on you or me!"
5,Lighthearted Biopic Akin to Catch Me If You Can,"Ferdinand Waldo Demara was busy deceiving people six years before Frank Abagnale was even born. Who's Frank Abagnale, you ask? You might remember: He's the guy ""Catch Me If You Can"" was based on. So if you liked that movie, then you're almost sure to enjoy this lighthearted biopic on Demara. That's assuming you like classic movies, of course. I wouldn't say this film is one of the all-time greats, but I easily give it five stars because it's an underrated, one-of-a-kind piece of entertainment that will hold your attention from beginning to end."
2,rather lackluster,"This one went into the CD recycle bin after three listens. Too formulaic. Too bad since Trey has a beautiful voice, but is let down by humdrum production, programmed instruments and boring material. If you want to hear Trey at his best, pick up a copy of Basia's The Sweetest Illusion and listen to ""She Deserves It."""
4,Sober Modal Jazz,"Excelent album in the style of Kind Of Blue, with some things remarkable respect to the last one. First, John Coltrane didn't mess up the things with machine-gun like solos, second, the playing is more equilibrated (no one got any stellar role during all the album), third, it isn't so abstract like Kind Of Blue and fourth, Bill Evans was given a more preponderant place in the playing. I don't think there's out there some other album in the same line of this (except Kind Of Blue) even in the Miles Davis' Discography. Highly Recommended for those who look for concrete and definite Modal Jazz"
1,ONE PIECE OF CRAP,"Back in the day ""Stella by starlight' was included in the original version of Milestones, it was my quest to find a great version of ""Stella By Starlight"" that lead me to this CD. Not only is the version of ""Stella By Starlight poorly done, the rest of the music was taken from Jazz AT The Plaza, which is poorly recorded and the noise level from the audience supercedes the musicians-SAVE YOUR MONEY"
2,Better than nothing,"Pro:1. Warm, I put it 4ft away pointing me.Con:1. It has to face me exactly to make me warm. (1-person-only heater; this is expensive for 1 person only.)2. I HATE that it makes this 7-seconds long dinnnnnng metal sound every 17 seconds. I thought maybe I got a defective one, but the 2nd one I got is the same.3. The heater makes loud beeps when I picked it up. I've to rotate it without picking it up.Even when I turned it off, the red light is on. I wonder if the heater is still on.Anyway, I got my heaters from Costco."
3,Definitely not for heating up an entire room,"The dish sends out very high heat in one direction. As said before, takes a long time to actually heat an entire room. Also, if you are in the way of the heat beam, sitting less that 10 feet near, your skin starts to burn due to the intensity.Not worth the cost. But again, there may be uses for this kind of a heating device that I am not aware of.."
1,PRESTO HEATDISH,"I BOUGHT THIS ITEM AT A RETAIL STORE ON 12/11/07 AND ON 1/18/08 IT STOPPED WORKING. THE FOOTLIGHT WAS ON BUT THERE WAS NOBODY HOME!! I TRIED EVERYTHING I COULD TO GET THE COIL TO COME ON BUT TO NO AVAIL. NEEDLESS TO SAY, I'M RETURNING THIS TO THE STORE NEVER TO BUY ANOTHER LIKE IT."
2,I don't like it ...,"I really dislike this heater. This heater was designed for exactly one specific purpose. The only thing on this heater that can be adjusted is the temperature setting and for the lower temps it doesn't do that very well. You cannot change the direction of the beam (up or down). This heater does not oscillate. It will eventually raise the temperature of the room, but if you enjoy having it do that while blowing on you, watch out. You might burn up!In the absence of anything else, this heater will provide some warmth."
4,7 years strong!,"I've had my heat dish for almost 7 winters now. It was a gift from my mother for Christmas for one of my first apartments. Being a poor college kid, this was the perfect solution. We could keep the heat down and still be comfortable. Now that I am a home owner, I still use my heat dish. My pets love the heat dish and as soon as I turn the thing on they all race for front row seating.*The only problem I have had with it is the light no longer works. It could be as simple as the bulb being burnt out, but since I never liked the light feature, I've never sought to replace (or fix) the light.I highly recommend for single person use. I doubt if you are looking to heat more than a person it would be worth your money, since it is designed to direct a concentrated amount of heat to one area."
3,"Heat on you, no where else","I've had my heater for 2 years and it has been OK but I would like more overall heat. I carry this heater around with me during the day, where I am the heater is and it works but it can get very hot too, so hot it feels like it's burning you. If you aren't directly in front of the unit you won't be warm at all so when I'm in my kitchen it's just useless because of moving around. It's like a fireplace, you go to it to get warmed up but once you walk away you get cold again. It works best in the bathroom. I will turn it on and face the unit to the shower and when I get out it's a relief to have it right there warming me up. I am looking for something a little better at heating the area around me though and not just directed at my lower body."
3,Very focused heat. Broke after a year,"I bought my heater last year. I enjoyed using it. Although I must say that the heat was focused. If you are looking for a heater to heat a room, this is not the heater to choose. If you are looking for a heater to sit near and feel warmth from, this is the one to consider. Think of it as a very powerful sun lamp, Without the UV rays. Sitting too close will actually cause you to feel burned. The radius for delievery of heat is quite limited. Similar to that of a sunlamp.I turned the heater on last winter whenever I was home. This year when I used it I noticed it was heating way too much. A couple of weeks into use, this December, I noticed it was still running while turned off. The heater has broken after one winter's use. I will have to buy a new heater."
1,Fire / Burn Hazard,"I have a Presto HeatDish Model 0791206I used the heater tonight, 11-30-11, for about 5 hours at Med setting. I wasgoing to move the heater to a different location so I moved the thermostat to the OFF position.I reached down to unplug it from the electrical receptacle and pulled it out. When I did this I touched the plug prong, after it was disconnected, for just a second or less and it was so hot it burned my thumb.I then noticed that the thermostat housing was very warm, almost hot. Upon closer inspection I noticed the end of the plug showed signs of burning.This heater has been used very infrequently. I would estimate that it has less than 50 hours of operation on it."
2,I shut it off right???,"I would use this in our front bedroom that is known for being a cold room. It gives off very good heat and one night I went in because the room was hot and turned it to the off position. In the middle of the night, my son woke up crying. When I went in, the dish was still on. I thought it was my fault because I was drowsy. It has happened well over a dozen times, then when I re-turned it off it would shut off. I just used it for the first times again in weeks last night and forgot about the issue and lo and behold it was still on when I shut it off. Now, even with re-turning it off it won't turn off. Scary!!!"
3,Must be made in China,"I bought my Presto Heat Dish-Parabolic Heater almost 3 yrs. ago. It is great for what it does which is directly heating what is in front of it VERY quickly and very quietly. However, this is my second purchase of the heater and they seem to last only 2-4 yrs. before something goes wrong in the thermostat switch. Of course, Presto does not make replacement switches, even though replacing it is a snap. So for $65 times 2 purchases in less than 5 yrs. I think I will go back to my oil radiant heat heater and just put it on a timer so that the one place I need the heat in the house, my office, gets it by the time I wake up and start my day. The last oil radiant heater I had, I gave to my grandson and he is still using it, more than 15 years after I bought it."
1,fire hazard,"Beware this item, the plug catches fire. There is a warning label on the cord that the item should not be left plugged in when not in use. I took this to mean not in use for long periods of time, not every time I turned the heater off. I really loved the way the heater worked, so I actually bought a second one (even after the scary experience of having the first one burst into flames), and faithfully unplugged the thing every time I turned it off (which was a considerable hassle). And even after doing that the plug melted to the socket and I had a hard time getting it unplugged and was afraid the whole time that this one too would catch fire. BEWARE"
5,Life Saver,"This product was purchased to stop our pipes from freezing. We experienced two weeks of subzero temperatures this winter and we almost had a huge problem, but the Presto Heatdish saved our plumbing."
4,great for the workshop,Bought two of these suckers for my workshop and boy are they great. keeps me nice and toasty while i am doing woodworking. now that the weather has started to turn a bit I am sure glad i bought them.
3,You'd better be sitting in the right place,"As many other reviewers have noted, this parabolic heater does what it claims to do: heat one particular spot. Problem is, the designers goofed and made the thing so you can't really direct it where you want to. It's aimed up at a twenty or so degree angle and that's it. If you're not situated 20 degrees above it, it won't do you any good. Kinda bizarre when you think about it. I bought mine at Costco for $59.99 (not the -YIKES- $99.99! on Amazon) yesterday. If you see it in Costco, you'll note that the display for this item has a working heater at a crazy obtuse angle basically dangling from the 90-ft ceiling so people walking by get scorched. That tells you everything you need to know about how directional you can (CAN'T!) get with this uni-directional device. I returned it and bought a much less expensive heater displayed right beside it that does a bazillion more things."
3,"good product, a little pricey","We got this at Costco for $60, which compared to less efficient heaters is pricey. It works as described. In regard to the much hated footlight, this would be a useful feature if the footlight came on when the heater was on and went off when the heater control was turned to the off position - if it were not for the fact that the heater makes a loud noise if you move it when it is plugged in. So, you'll want to leave it unplugged when not in use."
1,iDisappointed,"The concept of an iPod docking station and lamp is great, but the finished product was a total disappointment!There is absoultely nothing to like about this lamp--especially if you are an owner of an iPod Nano.The area that looks like docking station is really just a plastic compartment hoping to prop up your iPod. It's sized to fit bigger versions. The audio out from the iPod runs through an external wire and there is no charger.Oh, and if you like to listen to music...the speakers suck. The base is way too big, the speakers can detach but do not extend far from the base and the speaker don't stand on their own--they wobble.As for the lamp...the goose neck is too short and the actual light doesn't illumuniate enough area to be functional.I was disappointed."
5,Awesomeness!!,"Intense from start to finish. you really get to feel the true sound of underOATH's music. beautifull renditions of the songs from ""The Changing of Times"" and ""They're Only Chasing Safety."" if you love underOATH's music, buy this instrumental."
4,Life Happens,"This was a good movie! It was funny and entertaining and it had a pretty good ending! I would watch it again, but I probably wouldn't buy it, unless it was really cheap! Streaming was excellent though!"
3,Entertaining,"Cute movie with real issues for the actress playing mom. Entertaining to watch, maybe a tad slow but has a good message."
3,Entertaining,"Was kind of a mindless comedy. Wasn't anything I'd tell anyone to watch, or memorable. But it was entertaining and passed the time."
1,I didn't see it.,Disappeared from the cue and I didn't get to see it. I have to write 9 more words. Didn't get to see it.
3,Ending Missed the Point,Considering this movies plot was based on the main character taking responsibility for herself I felt the ending was predictable and wrapped in a nice hollywood bow.
4,Surprisingly Good!,"I really liked this movie. It is a ""chic flick,"" but really good. Not too sappy, good humor, good story, great acting. Loved it."
1,This Edition of the Software will NOT run on Windows XP!!!!,"It is VERY important to note that this software does NOT run on Windows XP. Compatibility mode will not work. There is NO way to get this to run on a Windows XP system due to a basic compatibility issue with the version of Macromedia Director used by the software designer as a viewer. This handbook is excellent though, and later editions fully support Window XP are I highly recommend this product in the later editions."
1,Blurry,This book is terrible. If it wasn't only $5.95 I would return it. The pattern ideas are weak at best from what you can see of them. They are not crisp designs that you can scan or trace but blurry-edged designs that look more like torn paper art.
5,Great Music,This cd is great! I really enjoyed all of the songs but my favorite was Part of Me Part of You. I would highly recomend this cd for anyone really. It's a great cd to put on in the car and listen while driving around. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did1
2,"usmle step 2: by rose S. Fife, et al","This book is written so simple and I think the writer had no idea about the type of questions appear on USMLE step 2. questions are strait forward, explanations are so brief. I compare this book to NMS review Q and ACE the board step 3 and A&L Goldberg multiple Q for the step 2."
5,great help for the boards,"this book is concise, intuitive, and very usmle oriented. great for foreing grads and even graduates of this country."
3,Pretty Good,"These boots are pretty good. They don't weigh to much. They are comfortable, water proof and cheap. They keep my feet warm in the cold overall good boots. But there are two problems with them.When I got them they had some kind of oil on them. It does not do any thing to the boots but when you get a mark on them you can easily see it. Also the tred on them is not deep at all. Not very happy with that I mean my shoes I wear to play basketball have deeper tred."
4,Nice Boots,"Haven't had them for a long time but I can say they start out really waterproof. Time will tell if they stay that way. A bit heavy, but what do you expect for steel toes? The tread seems to be designed more for shop floors than for dirt and mud. Don't let the ""400 gram"" in the description fool you. That's not how much the boots weigh, that's some sort of designation referring to the insulating properties. Anyway, I find them fairly comfortable, but still am very glad to get them off my feet after working all day in them."
4,Father Girzone does it again...and again!,"What an inspiration to read. It is easy reading and hard to put down, as are all of Father Girzone's books! I have become a avid reader of his works. This book explains in detail the relationship of Father, Son and Holy Ghost! As a Minister I have found all of Father Girzone's books INSPIRATIONAL! What wonderful reading, again! I would NOT consider this Christian fiction..... I would consider it insightful, educational and enlightening! I would love to meet Father Girzone!"
3,Fast Delevery,"Fast Delevery, very easy to install but mirror vibrates while going down road it appears to be poorly made on the inside exteror and body are very nice"
3,ok,unit operates fine but it is fairly complicated to operate having to use seval options to just playback.
3,This book has good stories....,"Good stories but does not keep young children interested because the pictures are too few and not very good. However, my older granddaughter likes it ok. I personally would recommend a book with more pictures to keep children's interest."
2,Not good,It worked several years. But now it doesn't work with my 16gb SDHC. I don't know if there is any update to make it works well for new SD format.
4,Genius for work snacks,"I love keeping these at work for the 3pm munchies. With so much fiber, they're pretty much guilt-free and they taste good."
3,Bag not thick enough,"Have purchased this brand for several years. Have noticed this past year that the quality of the bag is not as good as it once was. When microwaving, sometimes the bag splits open before all the popcorn has popped, thus leaving unpopped kernels in the bag - sometimes a lot of unpopped kernels. Also noticed that the Weight Watchers points have increased to 4 - quite a lot for the amount of popcorn per bag."
5,Love this popcorn.,"As a lifetime member of weight watchers, this popcorn helps me maintain a healthy weight without feeling deprived. I eat this every afternoon for a snack at work. Keeps me satisfied until supper."
1,CONTAINS KILLER HYDROGENATED OIL!!!,"How they can advertise this product as ""healthy"" when it contains hydrogenated oil is beyond me. Clearly they have sold their souls to the devil. Because the FDA (also in the devil's pocket) allows products to advertise ""no trans fat"" when the amount of trans fat per serving is .5 g or less, these people can get away with lying to the American public. Weight Watchers is also to blame for endorsing ANY product with hydrogenated oil in it.READ YOUR LABELS CAREFULLY, FOLKS: corporations don't care about your health."
1,COLOR,"The main reason why I wanted this hat was for the color. I dont care if the deliver was quick. I wouldn't care if it took a month, as long as I get what I payed for. The color the picture is wrong when I got the had it was an grayish light brown not the light brown in the picture. I even took a picture of it if you want to see it. And I tried ordering a different color and that color didnt match the picture either, you guys are color blinded."
1,Horrible sizing,The sizing for these hats is woefully bad. A supposed XL size would not fit my elbow. It really was not worth even 1 star
5,"I got whiplash, dancing to the wicked reggae grooves.","I got whiplash, dancing to the wicked reggae grooves on this album. My friends had borrowed this CD from me so many times, I had to buy a second, just for myself!!This is the ultimate party album. The title song is a beautiful steel drum melody, that makes me long to go back to the islands, and will make you feel the same. A must for any album collection."
5,been listening to it since it csme out,One of my all time favorite albums. Have been listening to it since it came out. Defines the grunge era.
5,Simply one of the greatest Rock albums of all time.,This record is tremendous plus a bit nostalgic for me personally. This album came out when I was in high school and still stands up this many years later.
5,Leadership 101,"Great book. Written as fiction so the whole truth could be told. Forthright portrayal of a Ranger company in Vietnam by a veteran who took his lessons at West Point to heart.Outstanding as a story of how an officer should lead men in combat. I recommend this book to every newly minted military officer and any one else who seeks the quintessential definition of good leadership.John Reid, 173d Airborne Brigade (Sep) RVN 67-68 & 70, 101st Airborne Division RVN 68-69 & 71"
4,Makes a great Sock Machine Stand,"We have, use and restore old [1870-1900] sock machines that have a right side crank handle. As this stand comes, a sock machine can easily be attached to it but it does not leave any room for setting tools or yarn. So it is not much more difficult to attach a wood or metal top that expands the usable surface. The design for raising and lowering the height works well, even with the weight [25 to 45 lbs] of these old cast iron machines. Very stable and no tipping so far with the center pedestal design. The feet are adjustable for uneven surfaces, a plus when setting up a sock machine at crank-ins, fairs and festivals. Circular sock machines are not what it was designed for but it works well and it is affordable. Possibly it would be a good stand for other favorite tools."
3,OK for a Portable,Not as sturdy as I had hoped. Would not recommend for grinders over 6 inches unless you just cannot go with a bolted down heavier duty stand. OK for my 8 inch grinder but only because I don't use it that much.
2,Matching Holes? Ha!,"After carefully reviewing the usability and adaptability of this tool stand to assure that it would accept the ""matching"" grinder I purchased at the same time, upon its delivery I discovered to anguished dismay that some tool manufacturers will advertise their products in the widest range of compatibility imaginable -- even though such claim(s) are untrue. This tool stand is a good solid piece of equipment -- but its mounting plate's holes do not match up with Delta's GR-276 (6"" grinder)mounting holes. To complicate matters, the mounting plate is not large enough to re-drill suitably spaced mounting holes! The mounting holes of the GR-275 are wider apart by apprx .75"". And there is no room to re-drill new holes either, and the grinder's base is cast iron. We can go to the Moon and devise robots to play around on Mars but we can't match up our holes on simple tools. Foiled again by our wonderful retail product distribution system. Whenever is it going to stop?????"
2,Cheap price...but not dishwasher safe,This is a cheap price but if you have very hot water set for your dishwasher the jar warps.
5,Perfect for culinary oils,Just what I needed to for my homemade oil infusions. The Dropper is great for precise plating and flavoring food.
5,Happy with the quality.,"Not really much to say. I use these for home made herbal extracts, and a few for fragrant oils. The eye dropper appears to be made of a rubber which I expect will break down in maybe 5 years due to expose to alcohol and would need replaced. Once used for fragrant oils it can be use for no other purpose, but that's true of any container."
2,Not what I ordered.,"I ordered the Cobalt Blue Glass Bottles with Droppers 2 Oz - 12 per package...two packages. I was sent the brown ones instead. Yes, they work the same, but we like to use the brown for people and the blue for pets so we don't mix them up. I had to use the brown ones since we were mixing up natural remedies for our pets and didn't have time to go through the hassle of sending them back and hoping to get the right color. I gave 2 stars because the order did come promptly even though it was not what was ordered."
2,Not well written,I read this because I grew up watching the Price Is Right. The story is interesting if true. I've never recommended it to anyone.
5,"A Ferrari, A Girl and Fun, Fun, Fun!",I absolutely love the Heart Attack mode. This makes OutRun: Coast to Coast different than any other racing game I've ever played. Goals other thzn just reaching a checkpoint add an excitement level that I've never gotten from any other car game!The girls are hot too for digital sprites!
3,ARCADE,"This is an ARCADE style driving game. If you like GT4, pass on this. I read a lot of reviews calling this a great game. They were written by young people who imagine what driving is like. After an hour with this game, I added it to my stack of games to give to my grand children when they get a little older."
3,Very nostalgic but...,"I thought this would be a great re-make like Spy Hunter. I was wrong. The game play is still 80's. The graphics and sound are only slightly better than Atari. It might be fun for younger players os if you want a trip down memory lane but otherwise it gets old quick. I played it twice and shelved it. If you like racing games, ANY of the Need For Speed titles are a better choice."
3,Games,"For some inexplicable reason, Amazon has removed the rate-movie feature from the main product page. One must now write a review in order to rate a movie and generate recommendations. This is not a review, but merely a means to allow me to rate this movie and improve my recommendations. If you are as annoyed by this new ""feature"" as I am, please register your protest w/ Amazon help."
3,Interesting,"I originally saw this movie when I was pretty young but it stuck in my mind.As a big fan of scary movies, I always remember the music from this movie as creepy. It is sort of strange story and Simone Signoret is a very odd character but I like this movie anyway.After seeing so many scary movies and comparing it to today's movies, perhaps it is a bit cheesy, the blood is not realistic looking at all.For some reason, I still like this movie. It is entertaining in it's own way."
3,Not too bad for an obscure remake,"This is the first time that I have seen this film available ANYWHERE! This is the first remake of the great DIABOLIQUE with Simone Signoret. The film stars James Caan and Katherine Ross as idle-rich urbanites who are into games of all kinds. They encounter Simone Signoret (in a different part from the original} as a cosmetics saleswoman who becomes their houseguest. Then the real games begin. There are a lot of neat twists in this movie, and remember enjoying it immensely when I originally saw it in the theatre. I haven't seen the most recent remake of DIABOLIQUE, but I doubt it is more entertaining than this one. Also with Don Stroud in one of his first parts. I may just have to buy this one."
1,A must (NOT) read !,"If I could I would give this book -5 stars. Due to it's lack of plot, Character development, or reality. All the characters in this book are so fickle, and extreme in their emotions that you can not help not caring for their situation. There is apx. 4 chapters of worthless writing before the plot! Mr. Manely never tells how cocks are raised, what they need, nor do you get to know the boy or his cock. Finally this book has extremely vulgar refrences. Usually relating to sex. If you would like a good read I suggest Maya Angelou's ""I KNOW WHY THE CAGED BIRD SINGS."" It is intelligent, smart, intresting, thought provacative and brings you into Ms. Angelou's world. Happy reading !"
2,personal,I down loaded this to my tablet and does not look words up like you would think it should. Sorry I do not recommend using it in that way.
3,Verseo Perfect Profile,"Okay, not as good as expected. The vibrating head should encompass the entire side of the product, not just a small area."
2,Okay,Not my favorite CD of his. Less worship stuff that some of his other CDs -but maybe that's okay with you?
3,Bad job on a good idea.,"Disney software, unlike disney movies, is generally very poor. The ideas for the actual programs are excellent but getting them to work on anything other than ancient pentium based PCs can be a challenge to say the least. This would normally not be a problem if there were any type of software support. There isn't. Zero, Nada, Zilch. You get the idea. You will get messages like incompatable sound or must run in 256 color mode to name just a few. Out of 7 PCs in my home (I build them for a living) I can only get them to run 75% trouble free on one old Celeron 533. So if you're looking for trouble free software for your kids skip the Disney stuff and keep looking."
1,Useless on Macs.,"A warning!If you are a Mac user, this CD-ROM is for PC / Windows only.Does not say so on product page.So the 1 star rating is based on that I could not run it on my Mac.It's probably an exellent CD-RoM for PC users."
2,Not worth it,"I love Cadillacs, especially the years up to 1973. I have collected literature and photos over the years. I thought that this might be a good addition to my collection, but was mistaken.A number of the photos are not labled correctly, pictures are grainy or have poor resolution, and there is no consistancy to any of the presentation. I have a better collection myself by just scanning brochures and ads from magazines like NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC.For all the effort and the price, I expected a much higher quality."
1,Cd rom,I dont think i will buy anymore books of amozon? Becouse i want books NOT cd roms!Its a wast of money!
3,Porter by Legrand,"Michel Legrand, that master of orchestral color! For the most part, all the songs are enjoyable, but for a few ballads, Legrand misses the sentiment needed to convey the emotions Porter intended. The swing numbers are the best, with a highly original ""Love for Sale"" and ""From this Moment On."" Recomended to those who are tired of hearing the same traditional arrangements attached to Cole Porter classics."
3,It's mono,"Unfortunately, all tracks are mono-mastered, so that the CD is more suited to the background than to the foreground."
3,NO TECHNO OR DANCE MUSIC FOUND HERE,"I LOOOOOOOOVE SHANNON'S VOICE AND ALL OF HER PAST MUSICAL ENDEAVORS....THIS MOST RECENT ONE IS SO-SO FOR ME....I GREW UP LISTENING TO SHANNON'S DANCE/TECHNO TYPE OF MUSIC SINCE I WAS A TEENAGER, SO WHEN I FOUND THAT SHE HAD RELEASED SOMETHING NEW SINCE HER LAST ALBUM ""THE BEST IS YET TO COME"" ( WHICH IS REALLY AWESOME), I WAS REALLY EXCITED!!! THIS CURRENT CD "" A BEAUTY RETURNS"" IS A SMOOTH JAZZ/SOUL/R&B TYPE OF ALBUM THAT IS VERY NICE AND RELAXING TO LISTEN TO FROM START TO FINISH, BUT NOT WHAT I HAD EXPECTED. (WHICH IS KIND OF COOL), BUT I'M HOPING SHE WILL RELEASE MORE DANCE AND UP TEMPO MUSIC IN THE FUTURE...WHETHER SHE DOES OR NOT, I'LL STILL BUY HER MUSIC TO HEAR HER REALLY SMOOTH AND SWEET VOICE!!"
4,Overall Excellent Filter,"If you're reading this then you already know what a GND filter does, so I'll skip the documentation.When you first hold the filter, you feel the weight of quality glass in your hands and not some cheap plastic. The graduation is fine and evenly spread out, and the transition is smooth.However, and that's the reason I gave this 4 stars, once the filter is attached it's really difficult to see where the clear and the dark sections are. I looked in the viewfinder, and I kept rotating and I could barely notice any difference.The best way to do this is to look at the front of your lens while attaching it and make sure it's where you want it to be.But don't let this dissapoint you, it's worth the money, you'll see the results on the picture after you take it, it's unmissable."
5,Great filter,"I don't like to do much post-processing to my pictures. My photoshop abilities are average, however I prefer not to use it so much. I prefer to use some filters and play with my camera features, and even invest some more time taking pictures that spend the time on the computer processing the images. With that said, this is my opinion on this filter.Is great to produce better landscape pictures, you can get more detailed clouds and sky, you can improve this type of photography removing that washout effect that you get when there is a lot of light in the sky and not so much on the foreground.Easy to put on and remove from my lenses (tried a couple).Built quality is good.You see the difference with cheap filters quickly and easily (believe me, I've got a couple of cheaper filters in the past)."
5,B + W 67mm Grad ND filter,The item arrived fast and in perfect condition. It seems well-constructed and has a good gradation from dark to clear. It definitely takes a little getting used to - not like non-grad's that stop light across the entire filter. Two stops is about accurate for this filter.
1,Ineffective,"I purchased the 77mm graduated ND filter #501 and used it with my Canon 40D. Although this is advertised as a one stop filter, I did not achieve that result. It was neither darker, nor were colors in the sky or elsewhere noticeably improved at all. The graduation is so subtle, and the full effect is so far to the edge of the filter (this is not a hard edge in the center of the filter), that I could only notice the difference if I aligned the dark edge of the filter with the narrow side of my image and it was only 1/3 stop darker. Even when aligned with the corner, I did not see much more than 1/3 of a stop difference. I used a tripod, and set my camera to manual when testing this. Perhaps a full frame sensor camera would achieve closer to the advertised one stop, but I would recommend you purchase the two stop at least (#502) or go a store and try a few of these out before purchasing.This was a very disappointing purchase, which I immediately returned."
2,"Good quality, but..","Axis of gradation is adjustable, and the turning fit is snug and smooth. I purchased this ND Grad to help with blown out skies in outdoor shots. Its effect is so subtle that it isn't helping in the situations I normally have - trees in foreground, with sky through and above them."
2,"Useless filter, you can barely see the difference","I bought this filter along with my wide angle lens (Nikkor 10-24mm). Important to mention that I own about 10 different B+W filters within my bag; and was disappointed with this one. I can barely see the effect of the graduation in my pictures.Definitely not recommended, and thinking of investing in the Lee rectangular-shaped filters as they are more user-friendly and gives you more freedom to adjust the GD filter according to the scene.I gave it 2 stars, only for the superior quality of B+W products!"
3,Seconds?,"While the quality of the glass & shading on the filter was good, it had what appeared to be a manufacturers defect in the form of a scratch near the edge. Since I paid less than half of what these normally sell for and the scratch was close enough to the edge that it didn't appear in my photos.. I kept the filter and have taken some great photos with it."
1,Nice filter,"Can't comment on the quality of the filter, I ordered it and after waiting a week I called. Then I'm told ""sorry, it's out of stock"" and they had no idea if they would get one in. Said they a called 5 dealers and Germany, nothing available. I would not have written a review but I see it's still listed as available. Beware.UPDATE: Now have this filter. It does a very nice job and I can recommend the quality. Upgraded to 4 stars ****"
4,Wish there were more!,"I heard of them more than 30 years ago on a LP. They bring memories and tell me how a guitar should be played in a small group. I am a music critic, no not much about music, but the playing is smooth and uptempo. Play this to any teenager and they would think it a new and upcomming group with new songs!Only wish they had more.Thankyou Richard Stephens, Keith McCormack, Jimmy Torres, Aubrey de Cordova and Don Allen."
5,A excellent introduction to turquoise,"""Turquoise Unearthed"" in a brief but thorough introduction to turquoise that would be suitable for anyone interested in turquoise and turquoise jewellery. Although only 74 pages in length, this book is packed full of information, including a history of turquoise, advice on purchasing turquoise, and a guide to the different turquoise mines in the American South-West. There are colour pictures throughout the book, including colour photographs of the turquoise you would find in each of the mines (yes, turquoise does differ between mines); a recommended reading list at the end; and most importantly, it actually has an index. The only thing that could have made this book better would be some sort of pricing guide. Nevertheless, this is still an excellent book and well worth the money I paid."
4,WOW!,"I found out about this book when buying some Native American jewelry at The Trading Post in Garden of the Gods. It is pretty cool as it tells a lot about where genuine American turquoise mines are and what the turquoise looks like. I have gotten to the point in my Native American jewelry collection that I want a signed piece and what to know where the turquoise originated. I would prefer a US mine but many gem quality stones come from Asia. Beware the cheap, non-guaranteed, non-signed stuff if you really care about what you're buying."
2,Not what I expected,I thought there would be photos showing what types of turquoise came from the most notable mines. Pictures and descriptions that detail the color and matrix one might find at any given mine. Really not all that suited for identification purposes.
2,Very over-rated book,"Not a good book if you are looking for government, non-profit, or academic work. It needs more real life interview questions and less fluff such as how to walk or whether or not to cross your legs."
1,This book was a waste of time,"During my freshmen year at the University of Washington, I was forced to read this book(1st edition). It was the most worthless use of my time and money. It is full of suggestions such as ""Join a student club to meet people"" and ""Ask your professor for help"". The best part of the book was selling it back to the bookstore for $1."
3,Be careful when picking your size!,"I ordered ""small"" for my wife, and boy they werent kidding. They were actually child's size (tiny). I ordered another pair (XL) and will give the first pair I ordered to my niece."
3,Do we believe wives should be fat?,"This book presents case studies of married women who gained weight. It even has a story of a woman who lost weight (yes really) and then faced with marital difficulties, put the weight back on !With overweight and obese women so prevalent today in the United States, this book is a start at looking at the psychology behind this phenomenon as relates to married women.I wish the authors had gone further with their premise and looked a tiny bit at history and sociology as well. It would be fun to see if the authors believe that full-figured women are going to actually end up being in vogue, as they are today in Africa and Polynesia, or were during the Renaissance. What is behind the weight epidemic in our country ... high-fructose corn syrup? Laziness? Relying on technology? A new beauty norm? An informal signal of marriage status?This is an intriguing topic well deserving of a followup from the authors."
2,Strictly Pedestrian,"I bought this CD based on the positive reviews of others, but am totally underwhelmed. This is my fourth Bank's solo CD (I also have ""Bankstatement"", ""A Curious Feeling"", and ""Still"", not to mention the entire Genesis catalog) -- and there's nothing on ""Strictly Inc. that hasn't been done better on another disc. And quite frankly, that's part of the problem: ""Strictly Inc."" is just more of the same material that has been reformulated and regurgitated. If you're into prog (like me!), you're going to be disappointed in this quasi-pop mishmash of forgettable tunes. There's nothing here even as remotely catchy as the opener to ""Still""; ""Red Day on Blue Street""."
3,Uneven,"This production seemed almost like is was a test vehicle for techniques used in CB DeMille's later ""The Ten Commandments"". It relied too much on circus acts that would be overwhelming on a movie theater, but just don't work on a TV screen and eventually became boring. The picture quality is fantastic.For me, the high points were Gloria Grahame as the sharp-toungued Angel, and of course Jimmy Stewart"
3,Dated But Good Natured,This must have been visually impressive for it's era. Perhaps we've become overindulged with tricks and stunts since then. The love triangle between the circus manager and the two competing trapeze legends seems a little cliche today. Thankfully there are unexpected events near the end that reveal the character and motivations of this group in ways you might not expect. Excellent for 1952 ...merely good for 2013 audiences.
5,Charlton OMG,"Who doesn't like a circus movie great color and I loved all the animals, costumes scenes just beautiful, will watch it over and over again!"
5,Wonderful!,This was a great movie about the big top. The inside of the circus that few get a chance to see.This was a winner in every sense of the word.
5,A journey back...,"...to a Norman-Rockwellian fantasy of a simpler time. You can't take anything Cecil B. DeMille did seriously anymore, of course; turn a blind eye to the un-PC-ness of the era, and watch for the charmingly retro uber-spectacle (and a fun performance by a very young Charlton Heston).."
1,Too little too late,"Over 1 month ago, I placed and order with amazon for the movie Greatest Show on Earth. It was to be supplied by a secondary vendor. It was to be shipped in time for Christmas, but is still not here. The fault is not with amazon, but with Treasure Hut, who has yet to see fit to answer any emails I have sent. I love the movie. That is why I purchased it."
1,Greatest Show (or Rip-off) on Earth,"Hard to prepare a favorable review for an item that was never received. I odrered this DVD a month ago, and have sent two follow-ups requesting shipping / tracing info, and have neither recieved a reply nor the DVD.Thanks alot!"
2,Should be renamed Greatest Bore on Earth,Only worthwhile thing about this movie is the train wreck and you have to wait over two hours to see it. Acting is way over the top and painful to watch.
5,Great movie,I bought this for my mother for mothers day. It's one of her favorite movies that she couldn't find anywhere in our area. She has already watched it and loves it.
4,My wife's favorite movie.,"It really made my wife happy when I finally found this on video. As far as circus movies go, this one is the best of the few. I finally started liking it after the 10 time my wife watched it."
4,Greatest Show,I first saw this movie in theaters as a teenager. I was glad to get a copy of my own. I don't think it was available on Netflix. Great service and prompt shipping
2,Not The Greatest,"This may have been THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH in 1952 when it won the Best Picture Oscar, but today it is just not a very good film. The acting is subpar, and some of the dialogue is simply laugh-out loud funny. The plot has tinges of a soap opera, with the woman caught between two men, the clown with the secret and several ""shocking"" moments, mixed with ""impromptu"" musical sequences to show off Betty Hutton's attempts at singing (she's not my favorite). The parts that don't have any acting, just ones that show circus doings are the most interesting and are a bit nostalgic, as not many circuses travel the country as they did back then. The film is too long, and there are too many audience reaction shots - however look for Bing Crosby and Bob Hope in a cameo. Why do we keep needing to flick back from circus goings-on to little kids licking ice cream cones? The ending is unbelievable. Don't bother watching this."
3,Look at it closely...,"Look closely at it--it looks like the front handle adjusts the height. It doesn't--it only locks to a manually chosen height.I put casters on it but the angle of the bottom isn't square with the floor, so I can't push it in a straight line.If you use one height and position the stand in one spot it's probably a good deal, but that's not my application."
2,Wobbly,I purchased this for my bench grinder. Not happy with it. It is not as sturdy as I would have guessed.
2,Refurbished,"This is a refurbished product though I don't see that stated in the item description. If print quality is not important, then this is a cheap way to keep your printer working. The one I bought did not last long before it started producing streaks on the prints. I had to replace it with a factory new unit and all is well - but wish I would have bought a new one to begin with."
4,Chicken & rice,"I made this with a bit less than 2 cups water. 25-30 mins - used flameless bag to heat. Flavor was fine, NOT enough chicken / good portion for 2 people just need a better rice to chicken ratio. Too high sodium (60% of daily need) but it doesn't taster too salty / used tabasco or pepper to perk it up."
3,Too much pepper,"I wish I would have known the amount of peppers that were going to be in this. I know it should have some peppers, but it was overwhelming with every bite. I gave it 3 stars because overall it is a quality meal. Lightweight, compact, easy to make, and filling; the taste was just way off for me. I saw where some people were complaining the rice was a little hard but I did not experience this. I did leave it in the bag a minute or two longer due to reading that from other reviewers so that may have made the difference.Overall, like I said, it is a quality meal while you're on the trail but unless you really love peppers then I wouldn't recommend it on taste."
1,i wanted to give this movie -infinity stars,"this movie is awful! spend your time doing something more entertaining such as watching paint dry on cardboard. i found this movie channelscanning on tv and the tv description made it sound good so i watched it. it was actually quite terrible.the general story is that a girl who loves to dance gets cancer. then she dies. that's basically it.to sum everything up, if you have a choice between watching this movie and sitting in rush hour traffic, pick the traffic. it won't bore you as much as the movie."
3,Love it for the dancing,"Alrighty so this isn't exactly the best movie when it comes to the story, but at certain points it is definately a tear jerker...I didn't like the relationship that the two girls had with eachother...I kept thinking to myself, why are they friends? It was just odd. And I also didn't like how the best-friend takes the prima dancer's spot and Larissa Olynik didn't have any ANGRY emotion...it was kind of unrealistic in that sense, but don't get me wrong...I don't think it's a bad movie...maybe because I am obsessed with any movie that has to do with dance (even Bring it on). The good things about this movie are the dance scenes...they're incredible so if you're into dance then I suggest watching it."
3,Good for dancers only...,"This movie didn't develop the characters very well. The storyline was rather weak and you couldn't help but feel that the two main characters weren't as close as the writers wanted them to appear to be. As for the dance scenes...EXCELLENT! As a dancer and choreographer, I will buy this movie as a point of reference only. If you're into strong storylines and well developed characters, don't bother. But if you're looking for ideas artistically for dancing, it's a ""must have."""
1,Bad Movie--Read the books!,"I saw the movie before I read the books so then I had an idea what it was about, but the movie was so different from the books. The books are so full of emotion and they really are alot better than the movie...I wouldn't watch the movies again but I'd definitely read the books. They are great books. I wish I had a relationship that Julie and Sammie have. Well, I hope this helped! :)Read the books! Way better!"
5,To see the small is to have insight,"For all lovers of the show, the Tao of Bada Bing is the most exciting thing since Ralphie was killed. The editors had the amazing insight to see that putting together the words and wisdom of the Tao with parts of the exhilarating scripts from the Sopranos. At a first glance it is hard to understand how the Sopranos could possibly follow the words of the Tao but as you get into the book you can't help looking at the Sopranos from a completely new perspective. When you read the book it is impossible not the be swept back into the emotions and action of the show, the scripts are just too well written! For all those who are counting down the days until the new season arrives, this book will be perfect to hold you over."
1,Good idea but there must be something better,"Meditation for kids is a great idea but I found this CD irritating. Her voice is very nasal. Think mild Fran Dresher. She speaks so quickly that there is no time to visualize or to take a breath, especially not a deep relaxing breath. She quickly rushes through the guided imagery portion and then you are left with 40 minutes of music. It wouldn't have been that bad if she just spoke slower and allowed a bit of time between images. I found this to be a waste of money. My kids don't like it either."
1,"great concept, not enough ""guided time""","There is only a little bit of guided imagery time and then a lot of music. Both of my girls (ages 6 & 9) listened to this CD and said, ""Is this IT?"" It was mostly music, which didn't do much for them. Instead, they both like ""Indigo Ocean Dreams"" by Lori Lite."
5,Kids--Welcome to the 21st Century,"With all of the commercial, mind-numbing ""crap"" so to speak, that is available to children these days, I welcome the calming, sensitive meditations on this CD. My 4 year old is very shy around strangers and I am working with her to lose her anxiety and to feel comfortable in new and different situations when her dad or I am not with her (such as when she attends pre-school). Ms. Goldberg has introduced us to a new method of getting in touch with my child's feelings with this calming CD. Thumbs up! Way up!"
4,"""Battleline"" by any other name","This is a collection of a 1963 TV series called ""Battleline."" Each episode focused on a pair of soldiers on opposite sides of a battle of World War II. It might be a Polish and a German Officer, or a Japanese and a British Officer. This is a great series for anyone interested in that war. The episodes included in this collection are:DISC ONE:Fall of MidwayGuadalcanalTarawaOperation TorchTobrukEl AlameinDISC TWOStalingradSicilyPloestiMonte CassinoAnzioBombing of GermanyAlthough the packaging doesn't acknowledge the original series, this is a fascinating documentary on World War II."
1,Picture got yellow after 1000 hrs - support sucks!,this is my second Philips projector and it has the same problem as my old one did: the screen got slowly yellow until it is completely yellowed after about a 1000hrs!And don't expect quick support from Phillips - I'm waiting now over 2 month for it to be returned. Phillips support tells me their waiting for some replacement part! By now they should definetly have supplied me with a replacement projector!!!
1,very short range,"I couldn't get mine to work beyond a range of about 15' -- not ""as much as 100'"" in my view. I returned it."
2,You Get What You Pay For,"I opted for this roller because I figured that there couldn't be that much of a difference in quality--WRONG - the mounting bracket is flimsy and I had to bend it into square so the roller wouldn't pop out. Then the bearings on the roller itself are such poor quality, even after lubing, that they are useless- the shafts rotate inside the bracket holes rather than the roller moving on the bearings---pay the higher price and get something that will work"
5,Great looking light,"This item looks just as good hanging from the bathroom ceiling as it does in the online pictures. I was able to install the base unit and wire it myself. For some it might be better to hire a handyman or contractor. But hanging the ceiling plate and the glass was not too hard. Hint: attach the plate to the base unit with the center screw. Then attach 2 of the 3 cage screws to the plate leaving the 3rd loose. Slide the glass bowl into position and attach the 3rd screw.The sound is soft and comfortable. (I think a vent fan should offer a little acoustical privacy when in use).The light doesn't come with bulbs (2) so you can install the type and wattage that suits you. I chose 25watt fluorescent for the soft illumination (I have a brighter lamp set over the sink/mirror). Be advised that it uses the small thread (appliance type) lights, not the normal size. Any home center should have both.I am very pleased with this fan/light unit."
4,much quieter,So much quieter than my old fan and it looks great too.The only drawback is that it is difficult to replace the bulbs.
3,Not comprehensive,"This book is not good to understand TCP/IP stack in Linux. The book has not gone through review for wrong section references. I have seen references mentioning to Chapter 4 when it actually is Chapter 7.It never explains the main processing of TCP like cwnd update and sshthresh. After reading the whole book I still didnt understand what is done in TCP like which function does what.A complete failure to qualify as a good book.I suggest ""Understanding Linux Network Internals"" which explains very clearly what is done in IP. I expect that the author of that book comes up with a second volume that deals with TCP."
4,Very useful book,"This book is a great reference for doing children's programming, especially for programs involving babies and toddlers. Lots of rhymes which appeal to children and good ideas on how to use them."
1,Metalious Was A Plagiarist,"Grace Metalious stole from The Prodigal Women, a 1942 novel by Nancy Hale. It blows my mind that this has passed unnoticed for fifty years. As I have stated in my Peyton Place review on Amazon, I would not be surprised if her entire book was cobbled together by various lesser-known novels. Grace Metalious deserves to be exposed as a fraud. This biography was okay, but without knowlege of her plagiarism, any speculations on what motivated Metalious' behavior after Peyton Place hit the big time is rendered moot. I believe that guilt drove her to distract herself with partying and eventually led to her early death. What terror she must have lived with-wondering when she'd be found out..."
1,Not worth the money,"I had to buy this book for my college English course. This book has to be the worse English book I have ever had to read. It is full of strong language, and sexual content. There is rude racial comments made in some of the stories. Personally I feel they found some of the worse stories and poems they could find and put them in a book."
1,Not for mastering this software,"I have been an IT Project Manager for many years and purchased this book to support the Enterprise configuration and deployment of MS Project 2002, NOT to learn how to manage a project (fail amount of space dedicated, e.g. WBS) and how to use MS Project in its old stand alone format, a la Project98 (like setting up a seperate project as a resource pool). This book is very poor at decribing the capabilities and how to use them of the Enterprise Project Server. Its like the book was written before the software was complete. I have had to and been successful atfinding Enterprise information on the web for free, not from this overpriced $45 book."
2,NOT UP TO CALLAN'S USUAL HIGH STANDARD,"I so looked forward to this book as Callan had not done a book in years. I still have her original book which started the whole Callanetics thing - it's out of print so thank God we have her videos. Unfortunately, this book falls short of her high standard. One big dissapointment is that the exercises are demonstrated by a model, not by Callan herself. Most of the photos are small and not all that easy to follow. In general the book has no pizzaz, and is geared towards the maturing woman and even advices on diet (the usual low fat type). I passed the book on to a friend who was interested, but I do not recommend it."
4,Important book in the world of fitness.,"This book continues Callan's idea that in one small subtle motion you can change the way your body looks and feels. She also gives practical advice on health and nutrition as well as stress management. The book contains the original callanetics basic routine and then moves on to include low impact Cardiocallanetics. One is led to believe the excercises shown are demonstrated by Callan herself, but it is hard to be sure."
1,buying someone's sales pitch,Maybe I'm missing something here.... I listened to this disc about 3 times to make sure that I understood that I just purchased a CD that would tell me how great the OTHER CD's in this program are.The only thing I learned from this disc is that you must purchase the OTHER discs to learn anything. That may have been a possiblity had I gained something from this disc. But to step out on a limb and order the second disc expecting to learn something which is much the same scenario that I encountered when I bought the first.... I think I'll look elsewhere.
5,Best ever,"I have used this stethoscope since 1994. It still works very well and the sounds are amazing. After about 6 years, do go back to the manufacturer and change the tubing. The first tubing change within ten years was free. I have done three changes. The last two changes cost about USD 50. The quality after the changes remained good. I have had opportunity to use Littmann classic and at times the cardioscope as well. This one has been the best. Will probably stick to it for the rest of my doctoring days. I have used this in GP practice, neonatology wards for murmurs and ED shifts. So if you can hear well in these areas of practice, it should be fine for all other areas in medical work."
1,Sent wrong product,"Even though box had correct size, wrong size was inside. It is way too long. I contacted them via Amazon for a return and after over 2 weeks with no response, I filed the Amazon A to Z guarantee. I had to ship it back at my expense to get a refund. I am still waiting for confirmation that it has been received and a refund to be processed. I will update this if it gets done. Till then, hope you get the correct product."
4,Powdered milk,"Hey, this was a surprise. I keep having trouble finding my goat's milk in town, everyone seems to be sold out at the same time, and the Safeway stopped carrying it all together. My girl friend teased me about buying the milk on Amazon. That's how I found this, and thought, why not give it a try. Alas, it is still powdered milk. If you are familiar with cow powdered milk and hate the smell of it as I do, you will recognize the smell in this milk. The big surprise was that it actually tasted good and the smell went away after getting thoroughly mixed. It still had little clumps that refused to dissolve, but it didn't smell icky and tasted just like the real thing.As a side note, I also discovered Goat's milk freezes well, so I've been doing that and saving the powdered stuff for emergencies."
4,"Same as what we buy at whole foods, but cheaper","if you're looking at this item, you probably already have your reasons for choosing goat milk and if you've tried this product from a grocery store, it is the same stuff. we like it and it's a better price here if you buy in bulk to get shipping deals."
5,A great product,"I bought this milk for my toddler so I tasted it first for a couple of days...I just love it and so does my little one. It is a great substitute for cow's milk and soy milk and it tastes great. I think that the fresh goat milk has a little bit of smell but this powdered one is just so rich, creamy and delicious. It does not mix easily with cold water so I use a small mixer/blender to mix it for a few seconds and it comes out even better!!"
4,good when u r allergic to cow milk,i've been using this products for more than a year for my son (5y) and my baby (2y)....both have allergy to cow milk...this product is better than the fresh goat milk because it is fortified with vitamins and other essencial metals and minerals
5,My baby loves it!,Best part about Goat milk for babies is the LACK of constipation and spit up. He just loves it!
5,Goat milk Rescue dog food,Adopted a rescue Irish Setter and used this to put weight on him. Fresh is better but not quite as available
5,Worked very well,"I used this in place of my fresh goats milk for a while until the kids were done nursing,mama goat has enough to go around now that the babies have gotten bigger. It was a great replacement for my hot process soap, needed something that would dissolve easily, in cool water and act like the real stuff. THIS WAS IT !!!! I would never take that nutrition of their mama milk away from the babies so I used this in the place of the fresh. LOVED IT !!!!! Thank You"
5,The next best thing to breast milk!,This stuff is terrific for newborns and anyone through age 3 and for anyone who can't drink milk. It has helped our daughter so much.
4,Lost Song,"I had a question. I have a very old Bobby Vinton tape entitled ""Greatest Hits/Greatest Hits of Love"" which includes the song ""For All We Know"". I have been unable to find it on any Bobby Vinton CD, collection, etc. I was just wondering if anyone else had ever heard this version, or had this version, or knew where I could get this version? I have Nat King Cole doing it, which is very good, but I grew up with that tape, and I prefer hearing Bobby Vinton sing it."
1,DON'T,"I bought this over the Thanksgiving weekend sale, special price. I have used the Braun for years and thought this was rather retro looking and at a good price. You get what you pay for. The only thing it does well is make hot coffee other than that it doesn't do everything else it claims to do. Nothing works right, it's a mess. I'm going back to Braun."
5,Best Coffee Ever,"I bought this coffee maker 6 years ago. The first day, I programmed it to start brewing about 15 minutes before the alarm clock went off. The wonderful coffee aroma woke me up. One taste and I was hooked on this coffee maker for life. I'm buying another to replace mine in case it breaks because this is honestly the best coffee I've ever had."
1,Disappointing,"I ordered this for my 7 year old daughter. She and I listened to it together once, and we were both disappointed. She refuses to listen to it again, so I feel cheated out of the money I spent on it. (In fact. I am returning the other CD, ""My Kingdom"" unopened, but I will have to pay shipping. Double cheated.) Maybe it was meant for younger children, but in that case it should say so in the product description. Also, the vocabulary was a little sophisticated for younger children. The spoken part of the CD is very short, followed by 40 minutes of music. If I wanted a music CD, I could have picked out a better one. I would never have paid this much money for less than 10 minutes of talk."
5,A Must Read for New Authors,"A friend of mine once told me that he'd log on every night to admire his book on Amazon. Bookless at the time, I figured he'd caught a nasty internet virus that would wear off as he became used to his new status as published novelist. Now I know that I was wrong. The Amazon bug doesn't go away with time or antibiotics. It's an illness fed by royalty checks and rankings. The savvy author should put that virus-induced fever to work selling books, but most of us don't know where to start. Fortunately, Ms. Howard-Johnson works in Amazon-eze as a painter works in oils. From cooperatively using the `listmania' function to promote your own work and that of others to exploiting the `So You'd Like to' function, Ms. Howard-Johnson teaches and inspires with one good idea after another."
5,The Frugal Book Promoter,"After wading through half a dozen cut and paste marketing books, I found it refreshing to read Carolyn Howard-Johnson's down to earth approach to book promotion. The Frugal Book Promoter is the real deal, easy to read and easy to apply.In her PR Primer she says, ""Don't publicize your book; instead ""brand"" yourself.""In other words don't be a one-pony show, after all you might write another book or invent something you'd like to promote.Frugal is filled with easy to understand marketing tips along with how to use postcards, get book reviews and Media interviews. There's also a chapter on E-Books.Tom Barnes Author `Doc Holliday's Road to Tombstone,' `The Goring Collection,' The Hurricane Hunters and Lost in the Bermuda Triangle.'"
4,Boost the buzz for your book,"An author's greatest challenge can be to climb the marketing mountain and get their title visible to potential customers. If a reader doesn't know about your book, how on earth will they be able to purchase it? Carolyn tells you how to promote, from sending out your own ARCs (advance review copy), to why a website is important, to utilizing all the perks of amazon. This truly is promotion on a shoestring. Bestsellers are made through buzz and Carolyn tells you how to boost the buzz for your book.Dee Power, Author of The Making of a Bestseller: Success Stories from Authors and the Editors, Agents and Booksellers Behind Them."
2,Waste of Money,"I put the book down after reading the urban legend recommendation of mailing a copy of your work to yourself in a sealed envelope and then putting it away unopened.You want to copyright something? Register the work with the Library of Congress, pure and simple."
5,Promotion Machine,"Just recently discovered this author, Carolyn Howard-Johnson, and what an impact she has made for me with The Frugal Book Promoter. She's a walking, talking promotion machine, as evidenced by Frugal. The nice part is that her tips and advice can be implemented easily and at little or no cost."
4,"Words of wisdom from an author who's ""been there-done that""...","This is a well-organized text that clearly was written by someone who speaks with the authority of experience.Carolyn Howard-Johnson has delivered a resource that I would recommend reading on an as-needed basis by consulting the specific chapters relating to particular marketing challenges as they arise.The way the book is laid out, with chapters ranging from using the Web to using postcards, you'll certainly find the step-by-step details for whatever task you're trying to accomplish. Scan the book initially, to get a good feel for its organization and scope. But save the careful page views for those times when you find yourself tackling specific promotional tasks.J.D. Mosley-Matchett, Ph.D.Author ofA month of Marketing Technology tips"
4,Promoting books,"I found this book hard to get into. The interior format bothered me, the pages seemed too busy and as a first tme author I did not find it that helpful. I did not find any tips that were particularly helpful to me and I've read other books on book promotion that I found much easier to read and incorporate into my own book promotion program. I got about half way through the book and decided it was not for me. -- Val Lul"
5,Generous Advice Dispensed for a Smile,"After I bought the ""The Frugal Book Promoter"" I had the privilege of meeting Carolyn Howard Johnson at an Authors' Day event. Later I subscribed to her newsletter, ""Sharing with Writers"", and watched her website, ""HowToDoItFrugally"" grow. Through her advice, recommendations, hints and leads one can tell that Carolyn enjoys rejuvenating herself with knowledge and revels in sharing her acquired wisdom with the world. ""The Frugal Book Promoter"" contains tons of practical and useful information on book promotion, keeping pace with technology. Carolyn is the quinetessential teacher reveling in the development of her students. One can greatly benefit from her leads, by reading the book section by section, right down to the last sentence. She conveys sound ideas, offering a wide range of choice to pick from. She is to be commended for carrying on an online classroom for a smile.Mary Terzian, Author, of award-winning ""The Immigrants' Daughter"""
5,Excellent advice,"Although this is slightly out of date, the information is still largely current and useful. There's a lot of great advice in this and it's strongly recommended for anyone with a book out but not tons of cash for advertising.A good buy.Sherlock Holmes and the Flying Zombie Death Monkeys"
5,A banquet of resources!,"This book is a MUST READ for every author! The resource lists alone are so paced with possibilties that it will take me years to follow up on all of them! Hundreds of practical, and low cost, ideas to help get the buzz going about your book, lots of specifics provided to get you going in the right direction. Advice on hitting your specific market of readers and for reaching the general media. Perfect for the author who is ready to take their book marketing and publicity into their own hands and get farther than their publisher ever could!"
4,Very Useful With One Drawback,"This book is extremely useful for authors who are trying to promote their own books. The author has obvious media experience and most of her advice is really sound. Take her advice on reviews and media releases-- she's right on the money.The only major drawback I saw was that this book doesn't give us any examples of what a media release should look like when it's put together. I think that if the author was going to focus the book so much on media releases and stuff like that, it would not have been a big deal to add a few PDF or JPEG images of sell sheets, media releases, etc.Dan Poynter gives examples in his books and I thought they were really helpful. Other than that, I think the book is still a good buy, since so many other how-to guides out ther just gloss over the media and publicity component and focus on useless things.Conclusion: Reccommended"
3,"NIce product, but have big arms","it's a nice product, well made, cool design. However, even on my average size arms, there's about 2 inches of extra armband sticking out past the velcro. If you're a big guy, it's prbly fine for you. If you're a young person, a woman, or a skinny runner (or all three) you might want to look for something that fits a little better. Not sure who they sized when they made this item."
2,Very awkward when lifting weights,"I bought this to workout with, and I really don't like it. I used it twice and it was just too much of a pain to bother with. Hard to use my iPod with it on. It puts it in a very awkward position. The armband was not comfortable either. The one good feature was how well it was made, but given how uncomfortable it was it would never get worn-out anyways!"
4,Very good book!,"I have been working for two years as structural engineer, and the knowledge of fatigue by most people was always suspicious for me. Unfortunately, I was dependant on peoples knowledge to obtain mine and, by looking for many books and papers on internet, all I found about fatigue were precise formulas with no physical explanation of the phenomena.Although I was not a fatigue specialist, I had always the conviction that this thema was much more experimental and microscophical-depandant then mathematical. This book proved to me all of that, and gave me a great insight of fatigue. Fatigue has became a very interesting topic for me since this book.The writing style of the author is also very pleasant, and we can read the book as if it was a romance.I got a job at Airbus for fatigue because of this book.I hope you enjoy it."
1,Still have not received book and no way to track,"DO NOT ORDER IF YOU NEED THE BOOK IN LESS THAN 3 WEEKS!!!!I ordered a book on December 10, 2011 and received a confirmation that the book shipped on December 12, 2011. Here it is January 4, 2012 and I sit without a book and no time to prepare for the class that is scheduled to begin soon. I sent an e-mail after two weeks and was told that what I already knew (that the book shipped) and they had no way to track it once it left its facility.I would like to be able to post comments similar to others regarding the content of the book or the quality of the received book but since I don't have it yet, I can't. It really hurts me to say that I have received better support and response from government agencies compared to trying to get this text book.You will not have to worry about another review like this from me as I will NOT order from you again."
3,Royal Machines Extreme 7 PDA,"Perhaps someone more attuned to electronics would find thisdevice to be what they expected, but my experience has beenless than satisfying. Programming the PDA has been a totaldisaster - I cannot do it. The PDA I used prior to thispurchase was a Sharp, and I used it with complete successfor approximately 10 years. I would like to return thisequipment and replace it with something which I can program."
3,"organizer is ok, but not terrific","This is a good way to jot down things to remember later, but it's a bit tedious to use."
1,Not compatable.,"I purchased this organizer a while ago. Although it seems to have many options and uses, it was not compatable to my Windows 7 computer. I was never able to use it. Very disappointed."
2,Poor performer,Very poorley written user manual. Does not work with Vista operating system and Royal support was very poor. Also the USB driver for the sync cable is not verified and causes trouble with printers. Requires you to unplug your USB printer when using the sync cable and the printer may not work after requiring a reboot of the PC. This is not what I would call a quality product in this day and age. Just pass on this one!
2,Not very good,"This is NOT the product if you have many names and addresses, that's for sure. It is tedious to input the information, tedious to look up, tedious to navigate, just plain not user friendly.In it's defense I will say it's cheap which is why it gets two stars instead of one. I would not recommend if you have more than about 20 contacts."
1,Don't bother with this product,This product is poorly designed and has some serious problems with its synchronization software. I couldn't get it to clear the unit and reload from the PC. It kept on ADDING the same telephone listings. Don't bother with this product - it's overpriced and a lot of trouble.
4,You get what you paid for,This product cost about 20.00 so please do not suspect it to do any high end stuff because it is not. it is not the best of quality but what do u suspect it is only 20 dollars if u want something that needs to do more then buy a palm pilot or a blackberry. Just remember u pay for wat u got dont expect something to last as long n do alot of apps. I use this for my basic needs. it is small n it does my basic needs store numbers n a few dates. at the end of the day u should have a backup plan for all this information. So far i had this product for 8 months n it is still workin fine.
1,Service Problem,"This product might be OK for some people but did not work for the application I had in mind. This was not the products fault but mine because I was hoping it could work for my needs. It would have been an inexpensive solution.However, I was not able to connect my PC (Vista) with the Handheld PDO even after 5 calls for help to India. I am 83 and had a hard time working with the techs in India."
4,Gets the job done.,A bit light duty for a car battery but works just fine. I'm using it from a 6/12 V battery tender.
5,works like it should,It's a replacement for the original Deltran unit. Looks the same and works the same. What more can be said! The clips tend to corrode over time.
5,Great Clips!,I have the bolt on terminals on all my two wheel toys.But this works great on my four wheel toys and on extra batteriesthat are on the shelf. I love my two Battery Tenders!
5,Works as Expected,I bought these for temporary connections to my car batteries while I'm working on them with interior lights on and I don't want to drain the battery. There's not much to say about them since they're so simple to use. My set works fine.
5,Battery tender aligator clips,Item delivery was fast and the item worked great as advertised. It should have been included with the original battery tender when it was purchased. The aligator clips makes it very easy to charge whatever scooter or motorcycle I want charged. I can't understand why the original had circle ends that made you unbolt the postive and negative connections of the battery so you install them to the battery and charger. The aligator clips eliminates the need to unbolt anything by just cliping it to the end of the positive and negative connections on the motor scooters battery.
5,got what I wanted,I just wanted a replacement end for one of my many battery-tendersthats what I got. priced right delivered on time.
3,Not Bad But,"This is a good product but the inline fuse does not work, it kept blowing each time I tried jumping off my bike. I had to cut out the fuse and it worked just fine after that.Anthony"
2,Weak Materials,I bought this to lift our canoe in the garage. The canoe is 65 pounds and is well under the 100 pound capacity. There is no way the product picture is correct. The moment I put any pressure on the hooks the material that attaches the hooks to the pulleys just twisted out of shape. There is no way I would trust this to hold a canoe above our cars. I relegated it to holding up a single aluminum ladder weighing in at 25 pounds just because taking it down and returning it would be a larger hassle.
3,Dont forget the gloves!,"As with the other reviewers I agree with the comments. What is nice is that the assembly is easy. Mine was missing some screws but I used my own to put it into the ceiling as opposed to the joists. I too have 14' kayak to put up and I found it pretty hard to haul it up on my own. I wish this came with the straps as again I sourced my own and mine slipped a little. The image makes it look like you can pull it tight to the ceiling but with the weight it swung a few inches lower. This was a challenge with my garage door set up. By moving the strapping I can squeeze it in. I can see how with continual use the ropes will go quickly. The ropes often get off track and I agree that the pulleys should be larger to avoid this. My hands were raw hauling up and down on the two rope system, it takes a while to figure it out. This is a good inexpensive hoist if you have a small boat and a safe place to store. I remain nervous..."
2,"Great idea, bad execution","I've been using a bike hoist from another company for years. When I purchased kayaks recently, I thought the best way to store them would be to hang them from a pulley system on the garage system. I purchased Bac Industries PH-01 storage pulley hoist. When I put straps around the kayak and attached the to the hooks, the metal that the hooks attached to twisted. When raising the kayaks (55 lbs for my wife's and 63 lbs for mine), the rope comes off the pulley. It comes off both the ceiling mount and the hanging hook. It happens so often, I started keeping my ladder in the garage instead of in the shed. The metal twisting is fine but the rope continuously jumping the pulley is unbearable. Caveat Emptor (buyer beware)."
3,The Pinker Side of Dukoo,"Count Dukoo... the evil Sith lord that started the Seperatist Movement... the one that outsmarted Master Yoda... the one that holds a pink lightsaber... wait!!This action figure is one of the best I've seen. He has great articulation, the best detail, and a really interesting name. But what really got me wondering was: Why does he have a pink lightsaber? I would really recommend this action figure. It made a great adition to my collection. But, I guess not all toys can be perfect!"
2,You Can Do Better,"This book reminds me of cookbooks by The Frugal Gourmet in that the recipes are hit-and-miss. Some of the ""curries in a hurry"" work ok but so many of the recipes in here are truely disgusting. I am a skilled cook and followed the recipes to the letter and they are just bad. However even the curries that worked out ok were nowhere near as good as Indian take-out. In all this book is just ok, I'd give it a grade of average. If I were you I'd try one of the other highly-rated Indian cookbooks available on this site instead. There is a cool Indian zodiac at the end of the book that is really interesting, but other than that....you can do better."
5,Iris,"I love this book. Every time I have guests over and am serving Indian food I make at least 1 recipe from this book. I own about a dozen Indian cookbooks and this is the one I always recomend. I just recently lost this book due to lending it out. LOL. She loves this book as well. The recipes are very user friendly and are not too dificult even for beginers. I seldomly write ""reviews"" but, the fact that I am willing to buy this book twice speaks volumes about it.The selling point for me was that it actually had the recipes for the curry blends. I think toasting the spices and grinding them yourself is better than a store brand curry. And there are recipes for homemade paneer to use in other dishes. The book uses recipes within recipes. So if homemade from scratch isn't your style this may be too advanced. On the other hand if you truely love Indian food and are not lazy this is a perfect book."
1,Plain Yuk,Don't waste your money. I tried two of the recipes and they were so bad I had to throw the food away. If you don't believe me just try the Goan Portuguese Style Spicy Pork (Shikar Vindaloo) on page 94 which calls for a cup of vinegar -- your eyes will want to pop out from the high acidity. or try the Masala Khichidi (Rice with Lentils and Vegetables) on page 170 -- it is a pot of mush -- trust me or prove it for yourself. The one star is for the information other than the recipes.
5,PERFECT!,amazing pair of shades! they're really bad ass! the lenses are very special too. you'll know what i'm talkin about once u try'em on. Oakley never fails you!
5,Oakley Bottlecap Sunglasses,"I bought a pair of bottlecap sunglasses 4 years ago and loved them, Till they went swimming I will be paying a new pair to replace them....."
5,A wonderful healing!,"Words cannot describe the healing I felt after reading this book. The many stories really hit home and it made you feel as if you were reading your own life story. This book was given to me by a dear friend and came at a time when I felt all alone and that everyone was looking down at me. However, after reading it, WE are not alone. Kari and Noelle really touched my heart and made me feel that my life will get better after all this heartache as well as many others who have gone through the terrible loss of a painful divorce."
5,Best divorce book of all the ones I read,"This was THE best divorce book of all the ones I read. The first time I read it, I cried through the whole thing because their stories sounded just like mine. Their words of encouragement meet you where you're at and give you hope, they help you see yourself as God sees you and show you how to pick up the pieces and give them to God so that He can create something beautiful from the ashes. I highly recommend this to any woman who has gone through a divorce due to an unfaithful husband. You're not alone. Even though it might feel like your whole world is destroyed, there are others who have been there before you and we're finding healing and a new life ahead. Keep your eyes on God...there you'll find peace."
4,ok,"Another hasty purchase as I was being tested- haven't read it- hoping I won't have to, but good to have if I do."
5,Basics about the Nazi Party...,the most inspirating study about the social structure of the Nazi Party.
2,Disappointment,"Muddy Waters is probable my favorite blues singer, but he should have stuck to what he does: SING, because he's no actor. I'm very disappointed with this product, wished I had of sent back for refund.Arlis F. Rice"
4,Comprehensive Look at a Sensitive Subject,"Mexican Phoenix: Our Lady of Guadalupe: Image and Tradition across Five CenturiesThose looking for a thorough, researched study of the Guadalupe phenomenon can be thankful for this work that traces how the famous apparition has been viewed, and used, since the 16th century. Its objectivity is evident from the beginning where it is the initial documentation, rather than the Juan Diego story that confronts the reader. Most books on the subject are highly emotional, devotional or political. This one isn't and is a healthy counterbalance."
1,garmanmania,I have found this unit to be difficult to use and would not reccomend it. Lowrance makes a much better and user friendly unit!
2,Confusing . . .,Research shows that vocabulary and idioms are better learned when they differ. Noticing is higher. Similar idioms in this book are clumped together making it difficult for language learners to separate the meaning and uses.
4,In the process of studying...,I am currently studying for the exam and I've been using this book as a basis. The individual chapters are fairly short and each one has a short quiz at the end to test your newly gained knowledge. This is helpful because it makes asborbing the information much more manageable - much better than trying to read Architectural Graphic Standards from cover to cover.Beware: some sections are somewhat spotty so count on having to use other resources as well.
5,A must have for new teachers,"This book is wonderfully straightforward and immediately applicable in your classroom. It clearly explains the why and the how so you can target this area of reading instruction which is often neglected. It is a quick read and the suggestions are easy to implement without a large investment of time or money. The activities suggested are meaningful, not cutesy, and the assessment suggestions are authentic. Also, the book suggests ways to allow students to track their own progress. This would complement whatever reading program you use; whether basal, 4-blocks, or balanced literacy."
2,Marginal Usefulness,"Although the information in this book is useful, it is not the activity book that the shopper might be expecting. The fluency passages are too few, and the lower-level passages are reapeated twice on the page. While this makes duplication easy, it sacrifices additional fluency passage inclusion. Although some of the speed drills and word activities are useful, this book is a little light on content."
3,Disappointed,The umbrella is fine for an adult but difficult to operate for a child and too large. I was very disappointed when I realized shipping and handling was $10.00 that was about what I paid for the umbrella.
2,jip,"The heat sink was poorly seated both physically and thermally with unevenly applied thermal paste and 2 spring loaded plastic posts.We had some serious headaches finding stable drivers for this card, which is also somewhat overpriced."
1,"Extremely overpriced, very dissappointing.","This books contains a useful set of lessons to get acquainted with the persian language in persian and roman characters, along with a set of 4 CDs. It is useful and you can definitely learn stuff.However, it is completely overpriced. The quality of the edition and the print are dubious & the amount of information is relatively limited. On the other hand the quality of the recordings leaves a lot to be desired: terrible sound, flawed english,and in the end nothing more than a man reading whatever is written on the book, as you literally hear him turning the pages.Considering it costs some $70 dollars and I paid half for a second hand copy, I strongly recommend to avoid this book. I still can not understand where the price comes from, but it is absolutely unjustified.Extremely overpriced, very dissappointing."
4,Lime green newsboy hat,"cute - can be worn with an outfit if you're into that, but is absolutely perfect for a luigi costume. I just bought some felt to make the L in a circle for my nephew. It's an excellent price and super cute. Shipped quickly with no probs."
5,Luigi hat,I purchased this hat for a Luigi costume and was very pleased with it. The fit was good and color was a perfect one for Luigi. It was shipped very quickly and I recieved it on time for Halloween! Great hat.
1,Green Newsboy hat,"I ordered this hat for my son who loves this color. I have actually ordered it twice since we lost the first one on an airplane. The first one was perfect! Fit well, well made. The second one arrived in Nylon fabric and fell apart after a few wears. The description on Amazon says that the product is made with 100 percent Cotton so I was very disappointed to see the Nylon and then to have it fall apart after a few wears. I would be weary of ordering from eHats in the future."
5,Good quality,"I bought this hat in green and red for my 5 year old boys' Halloween costumes. They were Mario and Luigi. They were perfect! A little big, but cute. The quality was great and my boys thought they were comfortable."
5,LOVED it!,"This came in great and just in time for me to make my boys' halloween costumes (Mario & Luigi, bought one in red too). It fit perfectly on my 5 yr old but I had to reconstruct this one to fit onto my 2 yr old. I used black & white felt fabric to put on the L & M on the top front of the hat. They LOVED it!"
5,PERFECT FOR LUIGI COSTUME,"The perfect hat for Luigi costume and the red one for Mario!!!!! It doesn't fit close to the head it has enough material where it is a little poofy on top it was a little to big for my 4 yr olds but I figured out a way to adjust the size but they could still use it years later as they grew. My boys' costumes were such a hit they were mario/luigi 2 years in a row for Halloween!! Very much worth the money, this is the hat you need for Mario/Luigi!!!!!"
5,Red and green perfect for Mario and Luigi costumes,"Just add foam emblems, long sleeved red and green shirts to match the hats, and blue overalls, and you've got great Mario and Luigi costumes. The hats are plenty sturdy."
5,super mario bros costume,"super mario bros costume I got the green hat it was so nice that I got the red one also.My grandson loves to dressup. I put a big (L) on the green , and big (M) on the red one."
4,Great for making a Luigi hat!,"Used this hat as the base for my Luigi costume.I simply bought some cheap felt squares at the craft store and cut out the L logo and used some craft glue to glue it onto the front of the hat.Everyone loved the way it came out and it was much cheaper than buying the cheap looking premade Luigi hat.The hat seemed to be of good quality and fit well, it has an elastic band to fit multiple head sizes.Overall its a great hat."
3,not pleased customer,"Very inaccurate picture. I am being Luigi for Halloween and I was extremely disappointed when I got a lime green hat in the mail. The picture makes it look darker, which is what I needed."
4,Juicy tale bursting with soul,"I really enjoy foreign movies, especially Asian flicks and every once and a while I'll try something different. I was attracted by the cover of the DVD, nice color and font, so I decided to try it out. From the moment it started I was sucked in, the thief was great. A guy just looking for a chunk of land he can call his own. The songs are great, especially ""The little donkey,"" which I had to make a copy for myself in my notebook. You'll definitely want to take a trip to Sicily after watching, the film really captures the beauty of the country side. Perfect date film. Enjoy.MoPop"
1,The Orange Thief,We bought this Italian movie to help us learn the lanuage. It was nothing less than idiotic. We found it a waste of time and money.
2,Tuff Orange.........,"Im a big fan of foreign films specially Italian films ..but this one is ranked among the very worse I have ever seen .....this film fail to deliver but one message the discontent of the Sicilian population with the current goverment,the lack of oportunities and so on....but half of the film is base on this caracter's ability to get this woman to sing in order to get some land promised by a murderer named ""Filo Fino"" I could not bare it is that bad.It doesn't develop this film was probably done with a very limited capital and an abundant lack of talent ,it went on and on.....I waited for a turn somewhere in the almost 2 hours but other than he got the girl to sing and sing ,that was about it.Dont buy it. Look at others.Buona Fortuna,MG."
5,"""The"" reference for position astronomy","If you are interested in any subject of position astronomy (motion of the moon, stellar navigation, astrometry, etc.) you must stat by reading this book. Eventhough it is basically a reviewed old text, it is still the most concise and complete reference on the area.It contains from the basic formulas of spherical trigonometry to the full explanation of the conditions necesary to observe a solar eclipse, or principles of star parallax measurement, for example.I think this book is useful not only for amateur and pro astronomers, but also for undergraduate mathemathicians and physicists, and even for highschoolers."
5,Best food source of Electrolytes,"I swear by this multitasking, multivitamin. Living in the Coachella Valley this time of year is challenging. It's made much easier by being properly hydrated. I feel better and I can do more when I take these regularly."
2,Does not play CD-R music discs.,"I have this player and it does not recognize CD-R discs. The only reason I would buy a 5 disc changer is to use it to double as a CD changer. Unfortunately this one does not recognize CD-R's. If you record your own music onto CD-R, this is not the machine for you. It also has a habit of dropping frames in DVD and makes popping sounds on music CD's. The programable remote is also limited in the number of other devices it will recognize."
2,Unsatisfied customer!,They have a lot of nerve charging this much for a piece of garbage. I`ve only had this product for two days and I`ve already experienced full frame losses. In one instance the movie stopped completely! I do not recommend this product to anyone and all I have to say to someone that does buy it is buyer beware!! The only good thing I could say is that it`s fine as a cd player and that is all. I will think twice next time I make a purchase like this.
1,Not Recommended,"I wish I had been more careful reasearching this unit before purchasing. I specifically went with the RCA in order to match other components in my home theater system, and I liked that the unit was lower priced than other 5 disc changers. That should have been a big red flag to me. I've had quite a few problems with the unit since purchase. Mainly, it will rarely play an entire DVD without frequently losing frames, freezing, or crashing completely. 8 out of 10 viewings, the movie will cease to play midway through, and I will have to power down the machine and ""let it rest"" before being able to continue. Very temperamental with CD playback as well. Lots of skipping and crashing, especially when using the random playback feature.I don't recommend the purchase of this unit at all."
1,Run Away!,This is a pile. It has skipped and paused and down right slammed ever since we got it. We buy lots of DVDs and this thing is just horrible.The features and controls are nice enough but the stuttering is just bad. ... I bought a DVD player to play DVDs. Not to have it drop frame and mess up every dvd I watch.Edit the part about you can get mine off the curb where I left it with the garbage. It was taken away by the garbage guys.I replaced it with a Sony NS715p. HOLY MOLY. What a difference. LOTR played all the way through without a single stutter. We have watched about 15 movies since and not one single error. None of the rentals skipped even a beat.Don't get the Sony just cause I like it.. ... It will cause you nothing but stress. Every time I watched a movie I spent more time wondering if it was gonna slam somewhere in the middle.
4,Satisfied so far,"Bought one on sale at Radio Shack. Installed at home in less than 30 minutes (already have an RCA TV, Receiver etc... so interoperability was a big issue for me). Played Audio cd's and 1 movies so far. First movie about 20 minutes in the movie stopped playing, I cleaned the CD, put it back in and it worked fine until the end. no issues with the cd so far. biggest complain is with the remote control - i now have 2 rca remotes (both ""universal""), i love PIP feature on my tv but the DVD remote does not have the PIP buttons and the TV remote does not have all DVD buttons - so i'm stuck still having to use 2 remotes."
4,"So far, so good.","Have this for a few months, and am happy with it.Its great having the 5 dvd changer for the ultimate convenience."
5,My Husband loves it,I bought as a gift for my husband and it is perfect for his night stand to empty his pockets.
5,VOLUME!!!!!!!!!,"The only product I have found that works for fine ""longer"" hair!! Does not weigh your hair down! And I have tried EVERYTHING! IT WORKS!"
3,hit or miss,"had a pair of these on my bike for miles and miles - loved them. however the the front tire of the last pair i put on developed a radially sliced wall within a few short weeks. i'm not sure if it was physically cut by something or if the material was just weak. i've decided to try michelins again and now ride with the krylion carbon's successor, the pro 4 endurance - so far so good."
3,nice but weak sidewalls,"with less than 100 miles on a tire had a small rock/pebble/something created a blowout in the sidewall while riding on pavement. They may be nice, light and puncture resistant but my original tires lasted for probably 1500 miles before I got these to replace them. If you buy these carry a sidewall patch (duck tape/dollar bill) and a spare tube (or two). I will probably replace my blown out Krylion with something else......"
2,Don't hold up,"I found the performance of these Michelin tires to be adequate. There doesn't seem to be too much in the way of rolling resistance and they grip the road well. The road seems to have eaten these tires up...I have less than 1,000 miles on it and the tires are full of holes--that may say something about the quality of roads out here in Hawaii. I'm getting a flat every time I ride. My next tire will be something a little sturdier."
4,"Hard to install, but looks good","Got these to replace my previous tire which was punctured multiple times by thorn on the road. These tires for some reason are very hard to install, extreme forces and tire lever required to put the last bit onto the rim. But once on the rim, it looks pretty good. Have to wait a while to give update on puncture resistance."
4,Great product,A great tire for a great price - I have been riding on this tire for almost a year and it's great!
1,"Disappointed, lasted for just 7 months / 350 miles.","I had high hopes for this tire. I'm a commuter and after 7 months (about 350-400 miles) this tire thinned out and was completely shot. I started getting serial flats, and realized the tread was fairly gone. It did have a strong start for the first few months and cornered well. But 7 months for a premium tired? Come on!"
5,It just goes 'round and 'round,"This is a tire. Yes, it's a good tire, it rides smoothly and I'm happy with it, but come on, Amazon, it's a freakin' tire! What more is there to say?"
5,Krylion Carbon rocks,Road through much debris with no punctures. Sticks great even wet. Super light weight. Looks great! A fine tire!jon
4,"Nice, Thin and Slick",Did not take much reshaping out of the box and the install was fairly easy. I ride almost everyday year-round so I need something that will last.
4,It's your choice . . .,"I liked this album when I listened to it because there are two different versions. Whaaaaa?!? you might say. Yes two different versions. The first version is more of an instrumental and mellow album. The songs are really quite beautiful. The second version is more of a pop driven album, which is pretty good too. I'm not going to compare this album with prior work done by Hooverphonic, because it stands alone in my mind.If you get the dual disc version, there is also a 5.1 suround sound to listen to, as well as a DVD of a mini documentary/interview of the band. It was great to watch because it gives an insight to the artists viewpoint about the album. Don't forget to turn on the English subtitles because they were speaking Dutch (I think it was Dutch)."
3,Not about the music.,You should be forewarned that the DVD side is PAL Region 2. The menu and static images shown during the songs may roll. Playable but makes selecting menu items a major pain.
4,"Not Finished Reading Yet, But Easy And Good Book","If you ""understand"" at least to some extent quantum theory you will enjoy this book. It is not described by math equations but Good writing and Analogies.You Must understand elementary particles to get quantum physics and mechanics to understand how they work since it's so different from our daily reality, you must visualize. I have read enough books and looked up info on the net to grasp the sense of quantum theory and it's counterparts, Read ""Parallel Worlds"" By Michio Kaku, He describes things so easily. 4 stars because no book is a five yet for me except the book previously Mentioned because of it's simplicity and wide variety of topics covered. Good luck opening your mind."
4,Can't wait for the next CD!,"I bought this after hearing ""Spirit Guide"" on the radio and I've been playing it non-stop since it arrived. I like that the songs all sound different and that they're about things that matter to me. Arigon's smoky voice holds it all together. I'll be in line to buy the next album. Hope they tour here so I can see Arigon live!"
2,Desperate?,"Some tones are good, some tunes good. Not worth the dinero necessary to buy it. I can tell that the previous good reviews are from non-music fans or militant friends of the artist. Very suspicious. Could they want good reviews so that it will sell or do they want honest reviews?"
4,Excellent debut album hits the mark,"I bought this CD after recommendations from several sources and I've found myself listening to it everywhere. It makes me feel good to hear such a wide variety of tunes on just 1 album and I find something new every time I listen. I think the songwriting is very strong and clever. I dig this fresh perspective of a strong, contemporary rock chick who is not afraid to speak out and have a good time -- something that seems to threaten those with small minds and closed hearts. If you like artists like Tom Petty, U2 or The Pretenders (in their prime) you'll enjoy this record. I think we've got a bright new voice on the music scene and I can't wait for the next album. I'm telling all my friends to buy this."
1,THIS IS SPINAL TAP!,"This is as silly as Spinal Tap. The lyrics are kind of simplistic and the tunes are not very imaginative. The guitar, bass and drum on some pieces are just plain sloppy. The vocalist never ventures out of a specific range giving the whole thing a boring quality--like listening to every bad song ever written by Styx.I was really expecting something interesting and unique, given the other reviews here. I'm a big fan of contemporary Native music, like Ulali, Jerry Alfred, Joanne Shanondoah, Jim Boyd among others. Instead I was really disappointed.For anyone who has read ""Reservation Blues"", you might imagine that this album would be the sound the evil record producers were after. Common pop done commonly. What a shame."
2,"Realistic fans, please step forward.","To quote an earlier review...""Like a drink of water in a desert of musical clones""Excuse me. This is a clone - there is no style of its own. Everything sounds like something else, which isn't so bad BUT buyer beware."
5,Bluegrass Heaven,great cd especially if your new to bluegrass. gives you a good sample of what the music is all about. And a good sample of what this record label is all about!
1,Not worth the price.,"This toy was purchased as a gift for my son for Christmas 2010. Two days later the neck broke and the head fell off. Upon observation the neck was a very thin piece of plastic and absolutely not durable. He was very disappointed to have this toy break so quickly and so easily. I am even more disappointed as they are hard to find, expensive yet valued so highly by children that play with them.This review has nothing to do with Jakks Pacific and everything to do with the actual toy action figure."
4,Good for beginners.,Has good beginning yoga sessions & a few medium ones. Older pp who haven't done yoga before may have problem with doing all the poses.
3,quick review,I enjoyed this very much. I like the way the poses were explained and the music. I would use it again
1,Audio too soft to be heard,"I'm glad I rented this video instead of buying it. I can't hear the instructor at all, even with the volume turned all the way up."
2,Did not enjoy it at all!!,Did not like this video. I found it dull and did not like how the scences jumped around...and audio quality was lacking.
5,This is a fine biography of confederate Gen. Richard S.Ewell,"There are three impressive aspects of this work. First, it is quite readable. The battle scenes and other events are as lively as a full color film. The historic characters are full dimensional figures who inhabit the book rather than being referred to. Even minor Ewell family members are brought to life realistically.Second, the terrain is imaginatively and graphically depicted. The author has a real sense of the places and the climate of the times. This is also supported by good made-to-order maps of important locales.Third, practically every assertion in the book is backed up by solid primary and secondary historical sources. This is done with no intrusion on the readability of the text. No judgment is made without balancing all extant points of view. A real work of moderm scholarship.Finally, I was surprised at how much I learned about historical personages and battles with which I though I was familiar."
3,Ewell gets his turn in the spotlight...,"Pfanz offers a most credible account of the life and times of one of the ""lesser"" lights of the Confederate pantheon. While indeed ""Baldy Dick"" lacks the nobility of Genl Lee or the exciting eccentricity of Thom Jackson, this offering serves the good general well. I found the author pretty balanced in his recitation of Ewell's trials and tribulation, be it in the realm of military action or his personal life. While this text is 500+ pages of small print, those with a particular interest in Confederate military lore will appreciate author Pfanz's efforts to bring Richard Stoddert Ewell to life..."
3,Are you sure Robert K. Krick read this?,"I disagree with a line written by Mr. Pfanz in his biography of Ewell.On page 326 of the book he discusses the failure of General Robert Rodes to attack Cemetery Hill the evening of July 2.This has been discussed in every book I have read on Gettysburg. However, Mr Pfanz has decided to put his own spin on an old subject. He states ""he(Rodes) tried to deflect his failure onto his subordinate Stephen D. Ramseur."" This is the first accusation of disloyalty and pettiness that I have ever read of General Rodes.I would ask the reader to check Rode's Official Report on the battle and try to discern how Mr. Pfanz could have come to the conclusion that the General was guilty of something so dishonorable.Too bad Rodes is not here to defend himself. It is easy to malign the dead.Pleasant reading but nothing really new on Ewell- a kind,brave and generous man who was very good at being a general until he was so severely wounded at Groveton."
4,Greek Mythology,"Nigel Spivey's prose is a delight to read. One hopes that young people will benefit from Spivey's synopses of some of the better-known myths of Classical Greece. The book, as Spivey himself notes in the introduction, was written to help educate his own children -- lucky children to have such a father in a day and age when children are schooled rather than being educated."
3,Entertaining but Erroneous,"Nigel Spivey writes very entertaining short stories but claiming they are ""Greek Myths Made Real"" is very inaccurate. His story of Orpheus and Eurydice is entirely fictitious and not even remotely based on their myth, which begins, in all of the ancient sources, with her death on their wedding day from snake bite. As a teacher, I shudder to think that my students would read this novel and, unlike I, accept it as an accurate retelling of the myths. It is, at best, a creative recreation. There needs to be a disclaimer on the cover."
3,Something you don't find anywhere,"I you are a non-native speaker and you want to learn the language with all its expressions, you'll find with this book what you won't learn anywhere."
4,Guiffre/Brookmeyer,"Interesting attempt at an unique form of the fusion of disparate musical traditions. Brookmeyer's playing is, as always, inventive and centered. I don't think I'll be playing this one as often as many others in my collection."
1,Horrible read,The writing is repetative and if I wasnt sure that Alan was a grown man I would have thought this book was written by a 12 year old. If this stops people smoking I am sure they would start drinking to try and forget this horrible experience. Not impressed....
4,"It helps, but....","I don't agree with Mr. Carr's views on nicotine replacement therapy (gum & patches) He says not to use them at all. Although I'm sure I would not have succeeded at quitting smoking if I had not used the NicoDerm step 1 patches. Other then that, this is not a bad investment if you're wanting to quit. He repeats himself many, many times throughout the book. But it's to get it through your head that you're not giving up anything by quitting...you're escaping drug addiction. The main thing I took from this book is that cigarettes don't fill the empty void inside you, they create the void. I tell myself that every time I get the urge to light up.So yeah, this book alone would probably not have gotten me to quit. But combined with NicoDerm CQ and Tea Tree Chewing Sticks, I believe I have found my winning combination. For $7, it's definitely worth a shot."
4,Stan,Country music is what I love and here is a great example. This proves that all the good music doesn't end up on the country charts.
4,Good Hardrive and good price,This harddrive is pretty good. It does the work it suppose to and it's a lot quieter than the last generation. It's very fast cause the 7200rpm and ATA/100. I recommand that if you don't want the top of the line but still a decent one. This is a good choice.
5,"Cool, yet inexpensive","With its 40 GB storage capacity, Western Digital's 7,200 rpm hard drive is designed for advanced desktop personal computers, making it an ideal storage system for Internet downloads, music, video, and other large files. The high-performance drive offers Ultra ATA/100 and Ultra ATA/66 interfaces, low seek times, and up to 100 MBps data transfer rates. The drive includes Data Lifeguard, Western Digital's exclusive combination of hardware features and software utilities that guard your data and software tools and make it easy to install, configure, and maintain your drive. i Think is super with a great price for its money. [...]"
1,"Never ever ever buy this HD, erased all my data","I bought this HD one year ago, I had tons of information like my personal files, also 3000 songs, 250 photos, including the last three digital photos I took to my Dad before he passed away, and all are gone. I could maybe forget the whole thing, but I can't have my photos back. I tried to solve the problem, paid money, did everything possible to see if someone could fix it...what a mistake, I can't believe it..."
2,throwout the ludwig P85 Throwoff,it's a cheap stock part. It is economical but it won't last very long. It is light weight and may not be able to withstand the rigors of the road
4,Recommended,We were recently at the falconry at Ashford Castle in Ireland. Our excellent falconer guide mentioned this book as the definitive read about this type of wonderful bird. I ordered it for my husband and he is enjoying it. The book itself looks like it stood on library shelves for a time and was discarded. This makes us like it all the more.
3,Ok Sprayer,"I was hoping for something more robust than my last plastic sprayers, but overall this one did not have that wow factor."
5,A friendship survives the travails of liberation,"If this isn't non-fiction it must be awfully close to the truth. The experiences of these two women, one from a small Iowa town and the other from a Chicago suburb, form a lifelong bond after meeting as roomates in an Iowa City Dormitory. The adventures and life lessons that follow are both sad and hilarious while always very real. The two manage to experience much of the tumultuous civil rights era while partaking of the free culture of that time. It is an engaging book that hooks you in the first chapter. Oprah, you should take a look at this!"
5,Glock Shirt,"Good fitm, I really like this shirt and the color is perfect for my lifestyle.Thank you,Mark S. Koslosky"
1,Absolutely awful,I was initially not going to bother to review any of the two Theatre Film Classic films that I purchased primarily because I did not want anyone to know that I was naive enough to buy this CRAP. I can not think of enough bad things to say about this film or the other film classics Brawn Over Brains except beware and save your money.
3,Good but ultimately typical horror flick,"Kiefer does a solid acting job in this remake of a Korean film. The movie is all about his character, Ben, coping with the evils behind the mirrors ruining his life. The first half is full of cheap scares and bland scriptwriting; however it does set up the rest of the plot nicely. About halfway into it, the plot gets much better although by then it feels rushed. Bluray picture and sound help a lot to draw you into the movie, but again the story feels poorly paced and written. Sutherland's acting is awesome, although I could also picture Bruce Willis playing the role of Ben Carson just as well or better. Overall this is a nice take on the ""mirror scare"" tactics that horror filmmakers have employed for decades; however Mirrors is ultimately a basic modern horror movie and does not grow beyond that."
3,Creepy and not bad.,"CGI spoils it a little but smart directing by Alexandre Aja and supporting cast make this Asian horror remake very watchable.Kiefer leaves his mark, he's great in this, it may not be the best horror but at times it's creepy and entertaining."
1,It has a surprising ending. That's the best thing about it.,"It has a surprising ending. That's the best thing about it. It also has a couple of startling scenes but not horrifying or suspenseful.Kiefer Sutherland can't save the film. If you miss it, you won't miss much."
5,Mirrors,"This movie was really good! had alot of good scares and a good designed ""antagonist"" good story and everything! i enjoyed watching it and i plan to add mirrors to my horror movie collection"
3,Decent to watch once,"I had read pretty decent reviews for this one, and decided to buy it on Halloween for the same price of a movie ticket. Well, all I can say is that its an ok movie, but definetly not one I would watch more than once or twice."
3,anna are you o.k. ? are you o.k. anna ?,"i did enjoy the film a good bit more than i thought i would . i read a very favorable review in VIDEOSCOPE (the phantom of the movies) mag . i chuckled to myself a good bit when ann was impaled on the pipe (so to speak) and an approximation of MICHAEL'S lyric sprung into my mind . i like the director a good bit (THE HILLS HAVE EYES) remake . i've seen better . i've seen a lot worse . it's my favorite genre . it was not too insulting . good grue . pretty fair script . loads of things you've seen before but still a fun and sometimes scary afternoon . certainly worth a rental . if you've seen a lot of horror you'll still be entertained . if you have not seen much horror you'll probably think it's the cat's p.js . check it out . if you're an avid 24 fan , you may not be able to divorce yourself from JACK Bauer syndrome . not his fault . he gives a solid performance here ."
1,112 minutes of bad luck,"OMG, worst horror film yet! Plot holes so big you could toss a department store through them. Amy Smart, what were you thinking? Not so smart, I guess. Jaw-dropping stupid, more like. Keifer Sutherland, you deserve to stay forever in that ending for appearing in this movie. I hope your agent is there with you! Hold this up to a mirror, bub."
5,Better than I expected!!,"I brought this movie about 2 or 3 months ago and I didn't have time to watch it until last night. I watched it with my sister and 2 of my friends. This movie was VERY GOOD!! You have to pay attention in order to understand what's going on, and once you know what's going on, you won't want to stop watching it. This is one of my favorite horror movies and I hope they make a sequal to it. I recommend this to all horror fans."
5,Very Great Spooky Thriller,"I watch this movie practically every night. For two main reasons, first because Kiefer Sutherland is in it and second because I love thrills, chills and horror in movies. This movie was very creative when it comes to mirrors. I give it two thumbs up. The movie really opens up in a thrilling chilling scene where the prior security guard Kiefer will be replacing is running is the NYC subway station in Harlem from something creepy and winds up hiding in a locker room where he finds a small window which he hopes to escape through but to his ""Oh F***!"" surprise when he opens it he finds it is bricked up and he cannot get out. Being he has hit a dead end he turns around, apologizes to the mirrors and suffers the unthinkably brutal fate in store for him by the mirrors. And here is where the terrifying story opens! Watch on and enjoy!"
2,good premise but unmemorable in the end,"This film starts off with a good premise, but it just progressively falls apart, despite the valiant efforts of Kiefer Sutherland and other cast members. Somehow, the whole thing comes off as dull instead of entertaining, gross instead of truly frightening, and although the ending has a good twist, it is simply not satisfying when all is considered."
2,"Great Movie, Rubbish Blu Ray Transfer",The 2 Stars are for the Blu Ray Transfer. I personally rate the movie 4 Stars.It is entertainingly scary but the transfer is soooo crappy that it 'snows' during the dark scenes.Skip it until there is a version with a better transfer.
4,Mannequins and Mirrors,"I expected to be disappointed by this movie, but was pleasantly surprised. Kiefer Sutherland does a great job as the hero of this ghostly venture. Also, great effects and a few jump scares add up to an entertaining feature. Amy Smart does a good turn as the younger sister. And the finale where Sutherland goes mano a mano with an antagonizing spirit is well executed.One matter of consternation is that the movie's visuals are really grainy. I don't know if this was intentional, or simply that my system is lacking. But I expected more from a Blu-ray version of this film."
1,i really hate this movie,this movie is so pathetic and not even scary in the least bit. it is just another generic horror movie. no redeeming quality what so ever. and the ending made me lol at how dumb it was SKIPPP
2,2 of 5,"There's a nice glimpse of Angela's bare butt as she's stepping into the bathtub. Amy gets wet and shows her sexy cleavage during a house flood. Those images are the best parts of this movie. And that's not a good thing for one that is supposed to be encased in horror. The problem is that the concept, as presented, is too silly to be scary. It's a movie about demon-imprisoned mirrors, but characters taking it seriously just make you laugh. The last three minutes before the ending credits are actually pretty cool. But by then, it's too late.marcellee.com"
1,There really should be an option for 0 stars,This may be hands down one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Don't spend money on renting it... watch it somewhere for free.
1,Not good the second time around,"This movie is not as good the second time around. Of course I never saw MIRRORS before, but everything in it is a warmed over cliche from a thousand predecessors. There are people vomiting, people pulling on rubber masks that are stretched over their faces, lots of movie blood, actors startled by sudden loud noises, and nary a scary scene in the mix. The other reviewers thought Kiefer Sutherland did a great job acting, but he must have acted only in the last ten minutes of the film, because he did not act any in the first part, and I turned the movie off before it got to the last ten minutes.Amazon has some great horror movies for sale. This is not one of them. If you want the crap scared out of you, try a really creepy classic like DRACULA, or PHANTASM, or if you REALLY want to scare yourself, PET SEMATARY. I am partial to CURSE OF THE DEMON, but not everyone agrees."
3,Hilariously Bad. Watch with friends,"This movie has some good creepy moments, particularly the very end, but overall, it's just a hilariously bad attempt at horror that goes completely off the rails in the third act. My advice is, if you're looking for GOOD horror, stay far, far away. If you're looking for horror so bad it's hilarious, I highly recommend this movie. Tip: it is best enjoyed with friends, and if you're anything like me, you will also find ""You gotta stop taking those pills"" to be the MVP of the movie - it can be applied out of context in SOOO many places in the film.-Z"
1,If you'ved seen 24...you've seen Mirrors,"The effects are better in Mirrors than in 24, but the plot is the same. In 24 Sutherland tracks down imaginary terrorists to protect ignorant innocent people, and in Mirrors he hunts down the invisible evil spirit in mirrors that are attacking ignorant innocent people--including his family. He plays the same self-centered, psycho-dramatic character who knows he is doing the right thing despite his schizo-paranoid tendencies. He saves the day and the paranoid wacko becomes the hero of the day, yet again. The end. It is not that scary, and the suspense only picks up after approximately 50 minutes into the movie when a storyline actually develops. This is not a movie to see let alone buy, unless you are just as confused as Sutherland and his writers are as to what constitutes suspense and perplexed heroic characters."
3,A LITTLE BETTER THAN I EXPECTED,"My expectations were pretty low going into Mirrors. I've been disappointed with most of the flood of horror movies/remakes as of late. I did like this directors other films, particularly THE HILLS HAVE EYES. Mirrors starts off typical enough then turns into a murder, supernatural mystery of sorts. The story has just enough depth to keep your interest and the special effects be they CGI or makeup were very well done. My main beef with the film is that it wasn't that scary. There were a few scenes that were creepy, and one particular gore scene was very unsettling, but other than that I got over the whole fear of the mirrors thing pretty quick. The film is never a bore and moves at a brisk pace. If it were not for the ending - and there is sort of a twist ending - I wouldn't have liked it as much. So over all if you sat through THE HAPPENING you should really like Mirrors."
1,NOT THE WORST EVER....BUT NOT GOOD AT ALL...,"The story sounded pretty cool: ghosts haunting people through mirrors by using their own reflections against them. And there's a few scenes that are fun to watch, like Amy Smart getting her mouth split open like a pumpkin. However, the entire story between Keifer Sutherland and his wife/children is way too cheesy to be in a ""scary"" movie. The section of the movie where the ghosts/demons/whatever are chasing after Keifer's family and traveling through water was ridiculous - I actually felt bad that the director thought any of these scenes were decent. And the story of the nun at the end....wow. I couldn't wait for the end to come, just so I could actually watch something good to get the sour taste of this movie out of my mouth. So, to sum it all up: maybe I take it back - maybe this IS the worst movie ever! Egh."
1,Unfinishable garbage,"The script sounds like it was generated by a computer, that's how lame and feeble the dialogue is. If you can get past the first half-hour of this puppy-piddle, either you have the patience of a saint or you are a blockhead. I am absolutely certain that no amount of spooky imagery that this movie has in it can justify making people sit through the lines in this junk. If you are tired of watching Ring-ish films with no plot or no-name directors who base a film strictly on CGI in that vein, then save yourself the rental money and just stay away from this and anything that looks like it."
2,yikes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"the only thing scary in this movie was the acting, whoever played sutherlands seperated wife was brutal, and kiefer was as bad an actor as the children, dumb plot too, this is a renter at best for a night with nothing to do, it will help you fall to sleep"
1,Ugh!..I could only watch it for 30 minutes...,"Extremely surprised that Kiefer would participate in a cheesy, low-budget, poorly conceived film like this. Weak believability in the plot and bad-acting except for Kiefer, who was mediocre. I gave this dvd to a friend who is less discriminating than myself. I certainly won't stay up nights not knowing how this movie ended!"
3,Jaw rippin' good fun!,"I remember being excited about this movie when I saw the previews. Nothing like seeing Kiefer Sutherland turn all goofy looking in a mirror. ""just washing my face, ahh I'm retarded looking now!"" The movie reminds me a little bit of the ring. A lot of newspaper rummaging which eventually leads to a trip out to the country. Nothing says horror like a country barn with a bunch of yokels. The scene that steals the movie though is the bathtub scene. If you haven't seen it let me just say it gets pretty gnarly. I didn't care too much for the ending though which is why I will only give it 3 stars. The ending was kinda lacking in my opinion. Lacking, that is a definitive conclusion. While I would not recommend buying it is a worthy rental."
1,Awful but atmospheric,"I like Keifer Sutherland, and I like horror/ghost stories, but this septic compilation of disjointed genre tricks and a bad script are painful to watch. Ghost story? Demonic possession? Alternate universe? Pick one already. The premise isn't horrible, but the inconsistencies are blatent and the execution of the storyline leave you scratching your head wondering if the director even knew what he was going after. Even the ending was a convenient gimmic inconsistent with the premise. All in all, one of Keifers worst. However, if there's a saving grace to this film it's the sets, which added a sense of menace and were genuinely well done."
3,Good until the ending left me dissapointed,Thus was an interesting movie. It kept me wanting to see how this would end and ugh what a flat ending! I thought for sure they could've come up with something more creative than that. I did think it was a dark creepy movie. I did enjoy the death scenes. It was pretty gory. I liked the whole thing except the ending. And yes they do leave it open for a part 2. But do we need a prt 2? Not really.
1,What a SHOCKER!!,"The shock is how bad this film is!! I enjoyed this directors take on Wes Craven's ""The Hills Have Eyes"". He remade it in 2006. However this film is a piece of stinking awful! Poor special effects!! Bad performances from decent actors!! The ignorant plot and hokey storyline.. PLEASE!! Just an over all disappointment for horror fans. After ""High Tension"" and ""The Hills Have Eyes"" I was siked about this film.. WHAT A LET DOWN!!"
5,Kiefer,I love horror movies and this one is great. It kept my attention and hit me in all the right spots. Keifer Sutherland is an great actor and usually makes a movie when he is in it.
3,Anyone else receive a dvd without Special features?,"I bought this dvd unrated, it has both theatrical and unrated versions. The problem is there are no special features as stated on the box and case. Just a bunch of trailers. The movie could have been better if the ending was different.It was suspenceful I like that. I am just one who enjoys watching the features."
2,Bad Movie,"Just saw this movie last night and wow..it was bad. The story jumped all over the place and it went all wrong. It basically involved this guy, who was a cop, and was having family issues. He took a new job, and the mirrors were responsible somehow for problems that were going on. From there, our ""main character"" - goes all around to find answers and save his family. If the plot sounds confusing to follow, it isn't because my summary is random, it is because that is the way the movie is. Another problem was the music in the film - it totally sounded way too over the top. Another problem was the fact that the movie had like 3 plots happening at once, and not enough time was spent developing any of them.The DVD was made professional enough, and while the menu looked great with all the bonus features, it wasn't enough to save this mess of a movie."
3,"DECENT HORROR FILM WITH A GOOD CAST, BUT...........!","'Mirrors' is a well made film with a good cast and pacing. The film has some decent scares and a creepy setting, but the ending is a little disappointing. Keifer Sutherland in yet another Jack Bauer type role is convincing as a suspended cop who takes a job as a security guard in an old fancy department store with some creepy history. The department store had a horrific fire and makes a very eerie setting with its burnt mannequins, grand hallways, ceilings and statues. It's not a great film, but it's better than the average horror garbage out there."
3,Not Bad,"I like creepy movies, and this one had it in spades. I even got to witness a couple of good Jack Bauer yells (Kiefer's trademark) along the way.My only, and biggest problem with this movie was the ending. I won't give it away, but let's just say I was not happy how things turned out.Otherwise, this was worth the watch, if nothing else, just to see Kiefer play a different role. Recommended."
3,It's all about Kiefer.,"A so so supernatural thriller. Not bad for the genre. A few scares and a twisty ending. It's really all about Kiefer Sutherland though as Paula Patton has very little acting to do. A solid three stars, and Mr. Sutherland does a fair job."
3,More watchable than I expected,"Mirrors was better than I expected. It's as gory as I expected, but not as unwatchable as I expected. It's imaginative and creepy. The director would be perfect for the Nightmare on Elm Street remake.The story is decent and Kiefer Sutherland isn't bad but he's been better. The Amy Smart bathtub scene is over the top disgusting though. No, I didn't have a problem with her naked in a tub lol. But if you saw the previews, it's obvious what happens to her. I also wasn't crazy about the very end. But other than that, I was surprisingly entertained."
5,If you are reading to read this is awesome,For people who enjoy reading for the purpose of getting into the story. The books written by David Eddings' are for people who get attached to characters and love to immerse themselves in reading.If you want to read simply to get to the finish line---Eddings is not for you.
4,a triumphant ending of a saga,"Unexpected concepts the author deals with, much humour and humane feelings, a very rich immagination. Eddings is the less boring heroic fantasy writer I have ever read: on the contrary, he surprises the reader in every chapter with something new and fresh. At the same time he gives you food for thought"
4,Nice,This fourth installment is an enjoyable read but Eddings doens't advance the plot very far so that we get mostly more of the same. Some nice little touches in it and the finale looms..
3,Too few things of note.,"This is the fourth book in the Malloreon (after Guardians of the West and King of the Murgos, and Demon Lord of Karanda, and Seeress of Kell).In this volume our companions keep heading further East, as far as the island of Melcene, and start heading towards Kell where should be revealed the location of the Place Which Is No More.Too few things of note happen in this volume. Our heroes are still tailing Zandramas and dodging various conflicts taking place around Mallorea (between Urvon's Karand army, Zandramas's Darshivans, their demons, Dals, Gandahar and their war elephants...). A couple of passages were enjoyable though: in the University of Melcene when Garion and company meet Senji, a clubfooted alchemist and untrained sorcerer who tells them more about the Sardion, and when the party is finally caught up by Zakath, the emperor of Mallorea, whom they gave the slip in the previous book."
2,Still the same old stuff.,"This book and series is so dull and repetitive, at points I felt like I was reading the second or third book of the series again. The wit is beyond dull, the characters are now beyond boring, and plot has slowed to a crawl.There are some fights between demons and armies, but the reader needs to trudge through the most dull aspects of the book to get to them.The good aspect of this book is that at least there is a sense that the travels and the monotony will end, and the final prophecy will take place. The evil sorceress, Zandramas, tries to slow them down, while the Seeress tries to keep the prophecy going.As usual, more of the prophecy is revealed, is slow, boring detail.Out of the 400 or so pages, only about 20 pages mattered."
2,"Different icing, same cake","I do enjoy eddings work, good plot, but by god, he gets repetitive. Every character has to make some sort of dry crack after a fight ""Are you okay?"" ""They arent."" If I read ""'Be nice' (character x) murmured"" one more time, Im going to freak out. How can -every- person in the world use that phrase? Its getting to be boring formula. Same thing with ""Oh, I do love you"" (x) said, nestling her head into (blanks) neck"". Once or twice, fine. 15- 20 times or more comes across as stilted and forced. It wouldnt be so bad if the Malloreon and other Belgarath books were the only ones like this, but the Sparhawk series is just like this too. Im having to force myself to finish this because the above problems are getting really distracting and aggravating. Good grief."
2,Trite.,"All the good guys are so powerful there's no way any of the bad guys stand a chance. Why do they even bother? Just let the damn seeress tell us all about how it's supposed to happen and then we can turn to the last page, read about how good triumphs with one great blast of blue light from the Orb, and we'll be done with it. Save us all a lot of time."
4,This Is A Great Book In A Great Series!,"I highly recomend this book to anyone wanting adventure! I have read the first two books that come before this one and they do go in order. I read the first two and could not put them down! I'm not a person who likes to read much but these books really got me to read more! This book is about a family living in an old farm house and are going to fix it up, but 2 ghostly siblings live there and Alex and Adrian quickly realize that these ghosts are being invaded by a poltergeist. But there are a lot of things both good and bad, weird, crazy and just unexplainable! But if you want to know what happens to everybody and everything? Buy this book and read it for yourself, but read Michigan Chillers #1 & #2 FIRST! and those are recomended too! And if you like those keep reading on in the series! Happy Reading!"
4,Worthwhile but Incomplete,"By all means read this book if you are interested in the history of the Silk Road.However there is a significant omission in this book. Xuanzang embarked on this epic journey because he wanted to learn Buddhism from the original source. But if you think you'll be able to learn much about 7th century Buddhism from this book, think again. Of course there are tid-bits and small blurbs about Buddhist ideas but it is more an expedient to advance the story rather than an effort to explain. This book is basically a travelogue, not a book of ideas.Of course researching the various schools and thoughts of 7th century Buddhism would have been difficult and explaining it to the layperson without being confusing or boring would have also been difficult. But still I feel that writing a book on Xuanzang without attempting to explain the Buddhism of that era is incomplete.Despite the above reservation, I still give it 4 stars because the rest of the book is quite well done."
1,NOT CABLE COMPATIBLE - BE AWARE,"Unfortunately Amazon.com does not make this very important point that this TV is not cable compatible beyond channels 2-12. However, they were extremely helpful with its return! Great customer service!"
1,Disappointment,"Tied to place this TV in my kitchen to replace another TV. Could not get any decent reception, even though the location worked well for an older GE TV. Antenna is on the top so if you want to place under cupboard it it difficult to move."
1,Nice but no cigar,"GE had the right idea but... The size is great, the style is good, the picture (tube) is better than average, but the tuner stinks! In order to get good reception you have to hold the antenna. I tried 3 different units and it was the same story with all of them. I really wanted it to work because it was exactly what I was looking for, except for the part about not being able to watch it with out getting a headache."
2,Design Flaw?,"I had the same problem as another reviewer where the picture is blurry for the first 15 minutes (I mean totally unviewable). This is my second TV of the same model. Both went bad with the same problem after about 2 years. Nice while it lasts, but it should last a lot longer! Time to step up to a small LCD TV."
2,O.K.,"If you need a roller that is not expensive, this one is O.k.If you need a roller that is light duty, This one is O.K.If you need a roller that is precision made, this one is not O.K.All four rollers I purchased have about 1/8 th. of an inch runout."
2,too small,I wanted something larger and pockets on outside to hold a wter bottle did return this item but had good customer service!
3,Leaks a little,"You have to be careful with this bag if you put a drink in it (like ice coffee) because the drink can leak from the cover of the drink. If it leaks too much the bag leaks also.It can't really be that insulated if the BAG actually leaks. I've been careful when carrying it & to put the ice coffee into a paper bag & lots of napkins around the drink. And try not to squeeze the bag, because that can cause the drink to come out of the lid. Try to carry bag tightly & not to jostle it. I also don't put the insulated bag into my tote bag because it can move from side to side. It must be upright in order not to leak!!! Seems like a lot of work just to carry a drink. Well, as long as it works!!"
3,Good price,The price was nice on this lunch bag. I did have to fix the front zipper because when it came it was off track. So far it is still holding up after 2 weeks of use.
4,Pretty good.,"A little smaller than i expected, but i really like all the pockets to store my food separately. Price was great, cheaper than the ones at walmart."
3,Just OK,"Sizewise, it is a little too small for our use. I have a 2 year old and i cannot fit a 10 oz sippy cup, lunch meal and snacks comfortably. I wish the bottom compartment was taller, so i can fit 2 containers in it. Besides, it started to fall apart after a few washes. It is also not practical to carry for my 2 year old - handle is way too long."
3,o.k.,"It would have been ok for a child's lunch. The item arrived to me damaged, but the company was very helpful and sent a new larger bag ( I was really looking for an adult bag large enough to hold an ice pack as well). Unfortunately, the new bag was too large, so the company said the would give me a refund. Over all, I had no problem with the company, and would order from them again."
2,not so great,"I bought three of these, one each for my three school aged children.Pros:- insulated- fairly sturdy for the price- colorfulCons:- upper and lower compartments are divided so even though the sack looks big, you can't fit large items into it.- lower compartment will fit SOME sandwich containers but not others because they are too big- upper container is not big enough for a 2 cup container of grapes or chips- i didn't notice that the insulation had any particular insulating value, and each compartment is really too small to include an ice pack- after a year of use, the bags are filthy and I can't get them cleanSummary: simply not large enough to pack my kids' daily food needs (e.g. a large sandwich, a container of grapes, a package of chips and an ice pack)."
1,Lunch bag is too small,Don't be fooled by the dimensions on this product. The dimensions shown are for the whole lunch bag - which has two compartments. The main compartment is too small for many things. I often take a frozen dinner (Lean Cuisine size/type) to work for lunch. I can put the dinner in the bag - but then I can't close it. It seems to be a nice little bag - but only smaller containers will fit in it. I will keep it for my son to use at school and get something else for myself.
5,Exactly what I expected.,"After reading some of the reviews, I was kind of concerned about receiving a tiny bag. This bag is tiny if you eat way more than you should. This bag fits my lunch. I'm 24, and I'm a healthy weight. For lunch I usually eat a sandwich, a yogurt, some sort of snack food and a coke. The bottom compartment easily fits 2 cans of soda as pictured. I don't know if it will fit a frozen dinner. But I never take those to work anyway. It's a fine lunch bag =]"
3,bottom compartment zipper broke,"the bottom compartment zipper broke after my 11 yr old son used this as a football in the school hallway. other than that it been his favorite lunchbox in his school career so far. we tried to get him to use one of his old lunch sacks but he got really upset and screamed, ""then the kids won't think i'm cool!"" so this must be one of those fashion products like Jordache was in my day. it also has a side mesh compartment for a small water container, and a plastic sheet to put a nametag label. the shoulder strap is too long, it is more like a purse, so we tied it off to reduce it, so it could be carabeenered to his backpack without dragging on the ground. yes kids are messy so this fabric bag will get messy and won't come clean. oh well. we are ordering a new one today."
1,Overpriced,"This needs to be rereleased if someone is asking $400 for it. Much as I love figure skating, I'm sure not going to pay that much (or anywhere near that much)!"
4,middle grades -- humorous,"Kids get a kick out of this book. Columbus takes himself SO SERIOUSLY. It's a good biography, works in a bit of context, and you get to see the stubborn side of Columbus."
4,DVD Rack,The product was exactly as depicted and described in the ad. The order shipped quickly and arrived in tact. It was a very good purchasing experience.
3,Works well as a lunchbox.,"I use it as a lunchbox for work. To give you a sense of its capacity, it can hold a six-pack of canned beverages. I can usually fit a few containers in there with room left over for an ice pack. Its construction is a little flimsy, but if you are just bringing it back and forth to work or something similar, it should hold up well."
1,not what i expected,I thought this was a book for grandparents to answer questions but it is simply a blank page book. There are no helpful questions to get you started.If you don't like diaries this book is not for you.The pictures by Anne Geddes are wonderful as usual but that does not help with trying to fill out your family history.
4,What a novel idea!,"What a novel idea. Everyone's heard of parent's journals, but grandparents need to be included in the memory sharing too. This beautiful book is a great way to do just that and the photos are just breath-taking."
1,Never buy a Brother Printer,"This and any other Brother printer I have come across is junk. You can not print black if you are out of another color and there are 4 colors, and it also won't even try to print. Has malfunctions all of the time when trying to copy or print. When I get a new printer I am going to beat this one with a hammer. I will never buy another brother product in my life and I will be sure to tell anyone I can not too."
3,"Okay, but not great","To echo another reviewers sentiments, RELEASE THE COMPLETE ALBUMS!!This CD is okay because this is the only place to get some of these old tracks on CD. There are also some unreleased live tracks, but from who knows where because Columbia thought it too much trouble to provide the recording info in the liner notes. This CD is way too short, and most of the live tracks exist in better versions ON THE ORIGINAL LP'S!!! I was really hoping for some exciting new material, and I thought I would get just that when I saw ""Wars of Germany"" in the track listing. I had never seen or heard of the song before. What I got was one of the worst performances of a Clancy/Makem song EVER. This should never have made it out of the vault. Overall, an okay CD, but don't expect anything new."
4,OK,I expected it to be a little smaller and the button was hard to push. Otherwise it is fine.The collectable card was cool!
2,"Small whole in top, makes a big mess in bags!","The bag does not close completely at the top, and i throw it in a summit sack with the rest of my climbing gear, kindle, phone and wallet. Not a BUNCH got out, but enough to get everything in the bag covered in chalk... not fun trying to get it out of every crevice in my phone and kindle!The loop for the belt needs a small caribiner.It does do the job for holding chalk while i'm climbing, but not so much when its in storage.My nalgene fits perfectly in it though! I am retiring this chalk bag to become my waterbottle holder for my homemade pack!"
1,Not what they said,They were supposed to be blue but mine are clear and dont do anything. Miss representation. I am going to return them.
5,"Thy Word, A Light Unto My Path","Great practical approach to understanding what the Bible teaches, in readable form,first quoting Scripture, then a personal exposition of the passage, followed by summing up in easy to read verse."
1,small,Much smaller than shown. Our dog finished one in less than 10 minutes.Not worth the price. Will not buy again
1,smells terrible,"My dog loved it, but the stink smell almost killed me...I had purchased bully sticks from local pet stores or Petsmart many times, never had such a bad experience."
1,Made me gag.,"They taste terrible. I must have eaten less than half a dozen before the smell prevented me from taking another bite. They do, however, have a wonderful texture and weight and feel just right in your mouth."
3,scimpy,The first time I ordered these I was very happy with how robust they were. But this time most are very scimpy and some were not the full length as described. For the high cost I was disappointed. I may look elsewhere next time I need to order some.
2,Disappointed,"I only used this camera for 1 day, but that was enough to convince me to return it. It takes several tries to get clear pictures, even in good light and holding very still. The camera may boast 3 Megapixels, but even on the best setting, the pictures were grainy and the color was dull, and I might as well have been using a 1MP camera. Learned my lesson."
3,Decent Read,"I liked this one. I mean sure, it was a bit slow, and yes, I did get kind of frustrated with Arden and her efforts to keep her secret, but all in all it was a nice read. Not a real page turned, but I enjoyed it none the less. I would recommend it for a lazy Sunday afternoon."
2,slow to read,I love Sandra Brown books! But I found that this one took to long to reach climax. I wouldn't say that the book was awful - but she has wrote better.
3,Sweet Story,While I thought this story was a little long-winded. I enjoyed the plot of the story. Arden who agrees to acts a surrogate mother to a famous couple out of desperation. Seeks to find the baby she gave up after her son dies. While I found Arden to be manipulative you can't help but like the book anyway.
2,Not the best,"I have read almost every single one of Sandra Brown's books and this one is definately not one of the best. I felt that the conflict was ""resolved"" in a very unexciting fashion and that the entire book was just a string of loves scenes. I usually expect Brown to make the characters struggle with each other before falling in love. Arden and Drew were drawn to each other from the very beginning and although Arden's secret made her nervous throughout the book, she did not let it affect any of her decisions. I thought that the story and the logic behind the characters' actions did not make sense. If I have to recommend a Sandra Brown, it would be ""Led Astray"" or ""A Treasure Worth Seeking""."
4,Pleased with Sandals,I am quite happy with the Easy Spirit Sandals I ordered. The fit is good and they are very comfortable to wear.
4,My first encounter with hand shadows,"I was given this book when I was 5 or 6 years old due to the similarity of my last name to the author's (only one letter varied). I played with it for a short time and forgot about it.Then, 3 years ago, within my own performing interests, I assembled some hand shadows to use in my various acts. I found myself referring back to this book again.The shadows taught are basic in how they are taught, but can be difficult to actually form them and make them look correct.I like it, but it's not my favorite.Also take a look atThe Art of Hand Shadows,The Little Book Of Hand Shadows (Miniature Editions)and my favorite one of them all,Fun with Hand Shadows"
3,Wanted more animals,"I got this book to entertain my toddler. I was hoping for more animals, but it should do."
4,Locksets,These Yale locksets were great quality but weren't as easy to install as I had hoped they would be. I had to have a locksmith come & do the installation
3,Good for the non-Computer simulation part.,"This book as a preparatory material for step 3, is good for the clincal and basic science part of the exam.It doesn't help at all for the computer simalation part."
3,Getting Started,"This is a good initial book to start your review for Step 3. However, the questions are often short and do not mimic the lengthy vingnettes on USMLE tests. Some of the information is incorrect and not up to date. Should only be used as a supplement but other books are definitely required."
5,"USMLE STEP 3; by Rose S. Fife, et al","I recommend this book to who ever wants to take step 3. I already read Swanson's Family medicine review Q, A & L Step 3 multiple Q and ACE the board step 3. the questions formats of this book is very simmilar to the step 3 . neither this book nor the other 3 books that I mentioned can be use as the only source for this exam( as you know step 3 questions are mostly deciesion making, and follow ups )."
3,Reasonable,"This is s good book, although there are errors but these are easily picked up while solving the questions. The explanations are succinct and on on commonly asked topics. I would recommend this book. This may be useful for step 2 USMLE as well. The book is little less organised e.g. you have to make it sure that you in correct pages while looking at the answers. Even then worth a buy."
1,Don't trust the Pic .......,"Or the first review. I have a feeling the first guy works for the company.....If you want a bag that will not strap closed, then this is your bag. The only thing it is good for is tossing some clothes in for a short over nighter. No toiletries or anything because they will fall out any time you set the bag on the ground. The only way around this is to tie the straps closed. Bahhh.I'm trying to re-do the clasps on my own with spare parts from a craft store.Save your money."
2,Missing a major landmark,How can the author write a book on the history of Milton Then and Now and not include the G.H. Bent Co. cracker factory?The Bent Co. cracker factory building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. This is one of the few commercial structures in the National Park Service inventory. Many photographs are available of Bent's factory from 1893 through the late 1940's. It would have been an appropriate addition to the book. Incidentally Bent's store is the number one seller of the author's previous Milton titles.
2,Dry Hair,"This product left my hair very dry after dying. The packets that came with the dye (shampoo and conditioner) were literally only enough for 1/4 of my hair. I would not recommend this hair dye. Creme of Nature products have something in them that leaves your hair more dry than if you did not use it and I am not sure what it is. The color was intense and what I expected (which is why I give 2 stars), but the quality of my hair after dying it was horrible. I had to co-wash my hair the same day to get some moisture back into it."
2,ADD is a complicated issue,"This book contains some interesting ideas, based on Emery's private practice. However, they are offered in a vacuum. The author does not discuss current research, or other alternative practitioners widely known in this field. Can one man's intuition with individual patients carry over in a meaningful way to schools, or other psychologists? If not, where do poor parents go to help their children? Emery has made a contribution here. It will be richer if he develops useable, tested protocols with professionals for widespread application. Ths book, is a starting point. Despite its flaws, I recommend it."
3,Good Book,ADD is not just a mental disorder. Those of us who are ADD or know somebody with ADD are very much aware of that. There is so much more to ADD than just a text book definiton. Dr Emery introduces us to a different concept of ADD. I bet most people who are ADD themsleves can relate to many of his ideas.This is very well written book on the subject of ADD. Many of his ideas and suggestions can still help those people who choose to see ADD as only a negative problem. This book is also set up so that an ADD person can read though it with ease.
5,A hard to find classic!,"Consider the fact that I've owned this album as vinyl, 8-track, cassette, and now on CD. Do you think I like it???"
1,Not for Laptops!,"Purchased this item elsewhere, and would not recommend if you are planning on using it to carry anything with weight. Used for two weeks to carry a laptop and an organizer and the strap broke where it was sewn into the bag. Would not use it to carry anything with weight, maybe a book and a few papers but that is it. It's cute and the pockets are great, but it doesn't work for it's intended purpose."
1,Pretty Bag but not worth the $$$,"The bag is beautiful, kind of big compared to others, but pretty. Problem is, the straps will break after just a few months of carrying your laptop or putting any weight in it."
1,Not durable at all!,"I purchased this handbag as an option to regular computer backpacks...thinking it will look prettier. Look wise its okay but the straps are too weak. Even though it does have a laptop holder, its practically unusable. 1 week of use resulted in breaking of one of the straps. I do NOT recommend this product to anyone.1-star for the size. Its quite big."
3,padding,"I like this product. My cat seems to enjoy it and it gives her a soft place to lay in. The only thing I can't figure out is, if she would be warmer directly on the pad or if she prefers to be on something softer. Anyway, overall great buy"
2,Not up to Electrolux standards,"This kit was priced right but was not the quality I expected from Electrolux. The PVC tubing was not smooth on the inside and has ripples and pits which will reduce suction. I also purchased additional tubing from another supplier that was much higher quality. The tubing is shipped in five foot sections and two of them were cracked on the end during shipping because of being packed tight in a five foot box with no protection on the ends. The kit was also missing the listed PVC cement.Amazon showed this item was in stock but did not ship it for several days. I almost always get items from Amazon in two days, yet this order showed up a full nine days later. I would have returned this kit had I not been so far behind on the installation because of the slow shipping."
2,Deceptive product description..,"**READ before you buy** Product description is deceptive...When you search for CR2032 battery, they will list several type; all by Battery-Biz , statingSeiko CR2032 equivalent $2.48Sony CR2032 equivalent $ 3.95NEC CR2032 Equivalent $ 3.35Varta CR2032 equivalent $1.49...The problem? They are all the same, they listed with diffrent ""factory Name"" to mislead you thinking ""A"" is better than the ""B"" brand,in fact the battery you will get in the mail is the "" VARTA CR2032 3V Lin "" battery. that you should only pay $ 1.49 for it instead of $2.48, $3.35 even $ 3.95..I undestand merchant use diffrent ""keywords"" to promote their product and increase visibility, but this...purely deceptive and should be stop. Me, I am the fool whom pay $2.48 for something that should only be $ 1.49."
1,The Battery Dies a Horrible Horrible Death,"The scale works fine, but the batteries die quickly and 9V batteries are pretty expensive. I got sick of paying for the batteries pretty quick and bought another one that works on AAs. I just bought another set of rechargeable batteries and use the charger I already have at home."
1,Not worth it!,"As others have stated, this scale eats batteries. But worse than that, mine died for good after less than six months and two battery changes. While it worked, it did the job just fine, but it did not last. Buy something else!"
1,"Lasted 2 months then gave ""ERR2"" message","I used several times after purchase to weigh portion sizes and everything OK. After being OFF and stored away for a month, the battery was completely dead (not even a volt left). Tried several new batteries came up with ""ERR2"" message each time. No luck finding out what it meant. Not worth the gas to ship back. It currently resides in the ""Cheap electronic junk waiting to be recycled"" bin."
1,Battery Drain,I agree with the other reviewers. Somehow this scale is draining the battery even after the display shuts off. I have to replace the battery every time I use it. I have also filed a complaint with the company.
1,"Bad, bad, bad","I didn't have the battery draining problems that other reviewers mentioned, but the unit up and died on me. Not worth the money."
1,Same problems as other reviewers - do not buy,I had the same problems as others. Battery would go dead if you left it in the scale. Now the scale itself is completely dead. Do not buy.
1,battery use,"I agree.I have to replace the nine volt battery about every six weeks.I am writing a complaint to the company as well, but am not so sure I will get a response"
1,scale of 10 it's a 0,This Salter scale broke in a month. I agree with all the terrible comments on it. Plus it wash hard to read.
1,Both units were defective,"I originally gave this product a great review (see below). However, both of the scales that I purchased broke within a year under normal use, one after only 2 months. Numerous electronics problems. When I attempted to contact the company under the ""10 year warranty"", they won't respond.Original review:This scale weighs foods in both ounces and in grams. Mine is accurate to about +/- 4 grams (about 1/8 ounce). It also has a tare or zero function, meaning you can easily subtract the weight of a bowl or other container by pressing a button prior to adding food. For the price, this is a great basic food scale and provides what most people will need. I looked at others in person before buying this one, and found this was the easiest to use."
1,Eats Batteries,"I've had this product for two months and have gone through three 9-Volt batteries. Before it wore out, the last scale I had didn't use that many in three years. So far I've gotten no response to the complaint I submitted to Salter."
1,Terrible product--failed within 6 weeks!,"This scale stopped working on me after only six weeks at home. I only purchased it for bread baking, and made about 3-4 loaves before it gave out. Avoid this product and, I suspect, all others made by this company."
4,Product was up to scale,The Salter Housewares Stainless steel electronic scale was as expected. happy with the item with the exception that the battery died in a week. My thought here is the item was in inventory for some time and the battery life just got old.
1,What were they thinking?,"This product is a perfect example of what a thin line there is between a good product and a useless product. You really have to wonder which genius in their Product Development Department decided that it was a good idea to have a digital scale display the American measurements in fractions, rather than decimals. I bought a digital scale so I could get exact measurements. I am now forced to convert ounces and pounds to grams in order to make this scale useful. Unbelievable."
3,"It's an ok book, but it overlooks some things","Melman and Raviv maintain that it is odd for the US a capitalist nation to be so staunchly allied to the ""Socialist"" Israel. They fail to realize that the socialist zionism is essentially a dead concept, that zionism has become a right-wing capitalist ideaology. It's simple, we finally created a nation based on zionism and where did it tend to capitalism or communism? capitalism..."
2,Outdated.,"Save your money and sanity, don't bother with this book. It's out dated, overly complex, confusing and just plain horrible.I donated mine to the local library because I didn't think it would be right trying to sell it to someone else.You can lean more online using Blender and free tutorials at CG Cookie. I was extremely disappointed withthis book and feel it was way over hyped by fans his fans. I can only recommend this book to Collectors."
1,HIDDEN AGENDAS,"This CD ROM is not what it appears to be. For the price, you get only a small region (the selection is at your disgression) of the U.S.. To get more, you have to purchase 'unlock' codes from the manufacturer or an authorized retailer. In addition, the detail is poor. A good set of road maps or U.S.G.S. topographical maps are better. I don't recommend this product."
5,Wonderful!,This is an inspired and original book It's easy to use and the recipes are quick and tasty - the dairy-free and wheat-free bread sauce is wonderful!- a real pleasure
1,Another copy of Puddle of Mudd!,"First we had Nirvana copying legendary grunge acts Puddle Of Mudd, but now this worthless and uncreative band Seether is doing it too! Unlike, Puddle of Mudd, these folks don't have any talent whatsoever! They are also very disgusting and immature! There is a line in one of the songs where the lead singer says ""I want to taste your monthly blood""! This is not good for children's ears! Have a good day, fellow readers (that is, if you don't buy this!)!"
3,Not a bad CD,"There weren't to many good songs on the CD but it was alright, if you really like the song 'Fine Again' then you should buy the CD."
4,Worth a Listen,"This cd will not blow you away and the critics will call them Nirvana clones, however if you are looking for a good cd with good catchy songs in the alt/grunge/modern rock label then this is the cd. A heavy guitar driven cd with good riffs and catchy lyrics and songs. The standout songs are Gasoline, 69 Tea, Fine Again, Pride, Sympathetic and FXXK It. If the sound of a grunge/alt Nirvana(do to popular belief Nirvana was not ""grunge"" - they were a punk band) sounds good then I would highly recommend this cd."
4,From humble begginnings!,"This band used to be called Saron Gas, but due to the similarities to the nerve gas used in WW2 of the same name, they changed their name to Seether.I have had the pleasure of meeting the band at some of their first gigs in South Africa and believe me their songs are about truthful and heartfelt issues. In a struggling rock scene in South Africa this band did the amazing and broke into the american market(something every band in South Africa hasn't been able to manage).Most of these songs are from their first album Fragile. But the rest are very new and very good.I mean...How good do you have to be to play on the Ozzfest tour in your debut year in America?????Very good:)Do yourself a favour and buy this CD. You wiil not regret it. It goes from heavy to soft to heavy all the way through!!!"
3,A few good songs,Only a few of the songs were good. The rest were just ok.I was a littlle dissapointed with this album.
4,Awsome songs but...,"So i bought Disclaimer a few weeks before Disclaimer II came out, and i have to say that just for the sake of having it the cd its fine, but now for about the same price you can buy Disclaimer II and get the same songs as the first one and new ones i think is a better deal but hey who am i to judge."
4,Hard Rock,"Straight out of South Africa, Seether provides a nice blend of hard rock and more alternative rock, this grimm cd is a hardcore pickup. A little 'gothy' in sounds, but, it works with the raspy voice of Shaun Morgan, very Kurt Cobain-esque voice.The hits like ""Fine Again"", ""Driven Under"", and ""Broken"" are a little slower than some other tracks on the CD, but, very good nonetheless. As to other bands bands, they could be compared to Mudvayne, Smile Empty Soul, Three Days Grace, and maybe even Papa Roach and Nirvana.Aside from the 'hits', my favorite song would be the screamy, powerdriven ""Needles""."
4,"Very, very nice","As the review says, this band does sound a bit like Creed; this is true of the singer in particular. However, Seether is substantially heavier and more powerful. I would also doubt that they share Creed's Christian worldview because of some choice lyrics on one or two tracks (Fine Again) Ordinarily I am not big on 'Power rock' but this makes the transition to the Metal category because of some very powerful tracks on this album (Gasoline, Pride). Beware that the version of Broken on this Album is not the same as the duet found on the Punisher soundtrack. Both are quality tracks, but the Punisher version is substantially improved. Overall this is shaping up to be one of the most memorable albums of the year, and Seether is one of the best young bands around."
4,Seether rocks out to the right music,"Seether has been compared to many different bands. But, in fact, they are unlike any rock group today. Some songs just flow, while others keep coming back to the same chords that make the songs great. Very good lyrics add to the music and the choruses are not extremely repetetive, like taproot or trust co. The length is a perfect amount and they do not waste any time or try to overdo themselves. I thank seether for making a very long-lasting cd possible and exploring different types of rock and rolling it into one."
4,Great Rock Album,"I was kind of skeptical when I first bought this but when I heard the CD I fell in love with it. Disclaimer is probably one of the best hard rock CDs of this year. Fans of Staind and Nickelback would I think, really like this CD. But one of the album's stand out tracks FXXK it reminds me of surfacing by a little band called Slipknot (maybe its the chorus??). All in all this CD is definitely worth the money."
2,This CD is not really good,"I saw Seether in concert and they weren't that good. I actually left! I bought their CD because some people told me that their Disclaimer Cd was similar to Staind's CD. They were wrong. I only listened to Fine Again three times...I suggest not buying this album. Save your money, get another band's album. Social Burn and Hometwon Hero's CDs are really, really good. Try them instead."
2,"Alright, But There's So Much Else...","Seether is a hard rock band, who sing about being lonely, depressed, scared, etc. I have no problem with expressing yourself through music so that isn't my complaint with this band. My complaint is the lack of originality. This is basically a better than average psot-grunge record. It's been done many times before, but better. If you want good hard gloom rock, check out Cold, Korn, or the band Nick's now in, Static-X."
2,Nothing New Here,Fine Again is a good song. It is the reason I bought the CD. But I don't understand the attention (ie rolling stone). I really don't find anything else on this record to be memorable. I would not recommend this disc to anyone. Download the single.
4,Why Don't You Have This Album Yet?!?,"Seether is a new band, and you may recognize their single ""Fine Again"" from the radio if you heard it. That song, along with tunes like ""Sympathetic"" and ""Gasoline"", have sound that may remind you of Nickelback or Theory Of A Deadman. While the album is full with rockin', radio-friendly songs like that, it also has it's share of dark, heavy songs that sound similar to Drowning Pool or Staind. This is a VERY good album, one of the best ones of 2002. I promise that if you like Creed, Staind, Nickelback or Bush, you'll like this album!"
5,"The next step for ""grunge"".","The single ""fine again"" definently caught my attention, but i wasnt completley sure if the band would be another band with a song more recognizable then the band themselves, but after recently seeing them live a Livestock 13, a three day concert festival at Festival Park, Zepherhills Florida, I realized how great this band really is. They played Nirvanas ""You Know Your Right"" and i have never seen such a reaction from the crowd. They played the song so perfectly, and the vocals sounded as if it were Kurt Cobain himself."
2,I don't know if my order was right or not,"I was sent Seether, Disclaimer II, a red labeled CD I do not know if it is the one my husband asked for or not... I won't know until Christmas morning! It doesn't look the the album cover that is shown here."
3,peom has the start of a nivana song they copyed them way to,i dident like it more like copying nirvana tracks on there cd
1,I was fine again after i got rid of this CD,"I bought this CD, like others, after hearing the song ""Fine Again"" on the radio. I would just like to say that if you were inspired to get this CD by that song, don't. To me this album is nothing new and you might as well just buy a Creed CD, or even better, a Pearl Jam album. This album ended up sitting on my bookshelf and I only listened to it twice. Fine Again is the only song worth listening to. I got rid of the this album quickly."
1,Another lamer Nirvana album,"So if Nirvana were still around today making lamer music like Pearl Sham is doing, you would have Seether."
2,Straight to the point: Don't get this.,"You know what the first thing this band probably said when they decided to become musicians? ""Lets just ripoff a bunch of talented musicians and hope that it covers-up how bad we suck"". This band is obviously nothing more than a huge ripoff of Cold and Nirvana. In fact, I went around playing ""Fine Again"" to people I knew and asked them what band it sounded like. Each one of them said they sounded like Cold. The only real differance between the two bands is that Cold is actually talented and can actually be consistent in making good songs. Seether, on the other hand, are a generic grunge band with only three good songs. Wait...make that three average songs.Anyway, if you liked the single ""Fine Again"", then just buy a Cold album and don't waste your time with this."
4,perfection with simplicity,"After seeing a commercial of Seether performing some of ""Gasoline"", I had to get it. I went and bought the cd the following day, and to be honest, I wasnt disappointed. With aggression driven songs as ""Gasoline"" to feeling with emotions with ""Broken"" and ""Driven Under"", this cd has everything every cd should have, high and low points. Perfection with simplicity, perfection in a cd with a simple effort in trying theyre best, Seether has done it."
4,"Cut the crap, this band kicks a**...","I hate it when a band gets a little bit famous, and all the sudden people hate them. Wtf is that? If you like a band, don't you WANT them to get some recognition? Of course, its an entirely different story if that band changes their style... N*E*Way, I've had this CD a long time, and after tons of listens I can say it's pretty much above average. Some of the songs (Driven Under, Fine Again, Broken w/o Amy Lee, Fade Away) totally kick a**, while others (69 tea, gasoline, pig) don't quite get to kickin. My favorite though would have to be F**k it, cuz the screaming kicks a**.Highly Advised for fans of: Trapt, Smile Empty Soul, Three Days Grace, Linkin Park ect..."
3,Could be better.,"When I heard ""Fine Again"" for the first time, I thought it was pretty decent but not the greatest song in the world. And that's still true as of right now, in fact I listened to the whole cd on their site and while it's not bad it's not amazing either. It kind of bored me after about 3 songs, and the lead singer's voice added to the boredom a little. It seems he has the same tone in every single song, he doesn't really change it, or maybe he does but it's not that obvious I'm not sure. Also lyric-wise this cd did not impress me in the slightest degree. I mean sure the lyrics are not total garbage, but they remind me of what every other wanna-be grunge band sings. Grunge went out with Nirvana, why are bands like these trying to bring it back? It's dead now, forget about it. Overall I recommend downloading before buying, who knows you may think it's one of the greatest cds ever."
2,Don't Bother.,"I'll Be streight up with this album...it [stinks]. Simple lyrics and non-original style make this band boring. Seether tries to sound too much like Nirvana. I am the type of person who likes to feel the music...but Seether just doesn't seem to put much into thier music and it shows. Two thumbs down. Don't by. Go buy Breaking Benjamin ""Saturate"", Project 86 ""Truthless Heros"", Flaw ""Through The Eyes"", or Sevendust ""Animosity"" if you want some talent and feeling in your music."
2,Inertia Creeps,"After hearing this album, I have to say that Seether seems like a band that can really do something, they just don't. They've established a promising and diverse foundation though, I must say; it sounds like their next few efforts will be better, and hopefully devoid of lines like ""She told me she had a gun, she said she'd use it, on me""...well, it was something like that..."
5,Seether-Rock is now Fine again,"I really like Seether's Cd Disclaimer. Im sorry but I dont like a lot of the bands out there that all they do is scream in their songs and all their songs are like 1:30 long.. Dont get my wrong, they really do have talent, however different talents appeal to different people.. But yeah Seether is just as good live as they are on their Cd.. I actually met them and hung out with them at their show in Springfield IL, where I learned that they are just a bunch of normal guys. They were really easy to talk to and get along with and it is really cool when an artist can give a little back to their fans. They are really devoted to what they do and you can tell when you talk to them. Their Album really shows a lot of emotions that they go through. They are just all around good artist. That is why I like this album and the guys a lot. I give this CD 5 stars!"
4,good but not creed,This cd is a sort of spin off of creed. The lyrics are excellent and the music is good. I would reccomend this to anyone who likes creed. The lyrics capture a sense of reality and true life experiences. Take a chance on seether you won't be dissapointed.
3,very utilitarian,"It works OK, but depending on where you put it, can obscure your vision. Also, it is prone to falling off as the temperature of whatever you've stuck it to rises and falls. One thing that works really well is the lock that secures the eMap to the device."
5,This book was my bible...,"I did extensive research before going overseas to volunteer, and this book was my bible, beacon, guiding light, whatever you want to call it. It answered questions I didn't even know I had, and opened my eyes to the various ways I could accomplish a goal that, at the beginning, I thought had very few options for accomplishment. The appendix is incredibly thorough, and that alone could be a great resource. This book changed my ideas about how I wanted to volunteer, and in the end I completely restructured my plan and had a wonderful experience abroad. I would have felt very lost without this resource.."
5,A must-read for those who want to do it right,"A lot of people seek to broaden their personal horizons overseas, and some of them hope to make the world a better place while they do. Unfortunately, many are unable to find their way through a maze of humanitarian and international organizations of differing quality, to the ones that can really satisfy those goals. Ultimately, this undermines the volunteer's self-selected mission. With that in mind, ""How to Live Your Dream of Volunteering Overseas"" is a tremendous resource and a real contribution for any volunteer who wants to make the most of their time and energy, both for the needy and for themselves."
3,It has it's moments...,The movie was ok and nothing earth shattering. The women were pretty and the story so-so.
1,Don't Waste Your Money!!,"Not even worth renting. I didn't laugh, it is not 'sexy' or anything like that. Boring."
5,Nikon Battery Charger,"Alright, so I haven't used the car charger part of this product yet, but I can tell you that I really enjoy the wall portion if it =) It's worked great thus far and I've already used it multiple times--And so has a friend of mine for a trip that she took, and she didn't say that she had any problems. So that's a plus ;) And as far as the length of the hold on the charge, I'd say that it's pretty good. I haven't timed it to a T yet, but it keeps for as long as I need it to. ;)So I would say its pretty great. Oh, and I also like the fact that the plug-in part of it folds into the back if it-makes it easier for traveling/packing purposes. I Really, Thoroughly enjoy that part of it (maybe even better than the fact that it charges batteries ;)). So yeah, that's what I've got to say about it; hope it helps. :D"
3,Good value for cost,"It works via car or wall socket, charging battery just fine. The battery does not click in tight as with Nikon's charger and this may bother some. The light does not seem to clearly indicate when charge is complete, but it charges battery just fine."
