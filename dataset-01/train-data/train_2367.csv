1,worst movie everrrrrrrrrrrrr,This has got to be the worst movie ever. The whole time these bored redneck kids are playing pranks on people and recording themselves. It looks like a blair witch project gone bad!!!! Then the last 15 mins of the movie is when the action starts with bad acting and horrible camera footage. Save your money and buy a number 2 from Mc Donalds. This movie sucks!!!!
1,horrible.,"I like scary movies and movies that make you jump. I am not all that picky so long as I am at least entertained on some level. This wasn't scary, or even funny in it's ""horridness"", it was just boring. I wasn't expecting much, but it delivered absolutely nothing of interest."
1,Still dizzy from the constant camera movement.,Still dizzy from the constant camera movement. This movie was hard to watch. Home movie look and bad storyline. Would not reccomend!
2,Slow,The movie didn't build any suspense and it didn't pick up until the very end. Even the ending wasn't that exciting.
2,I've seen worse,Yeah there are worse movies but you have to look to find them. I gave this thing two stars because it was filmed in the real Ohio instead of Southern California but that's about all it has going for it. I admire any film maker who films outside of Southern Californis no matter how bad his/her film is. If you like what looks like a direct to video movie starring some chubby girls and some smelly looking guys driving around doing nothing you might like it after 18 beers or so.
1,I have never been so glad to see some one die.,"I just wasted an hour and a half of my life. I love these kind of ""amateur video"" movie and I love scary flix in general. But,this was slow and dull and pointless. On top of that in the end they really never even explain why the the 15 minuets of action did happen. they quickly eluded to some mythos in the beginning but never flesh it out. it was a real disappointment. it had a lot of potential with a good back story they could have used, but they failed to. two thumbs down from this girl!"
5,"I just love movies, more and more",different but enjoyable I love movies so I'll try anything once. amazon prime for tv and movies and free shipping love it
3,Good Movie,"It is a movie about getting what you deserve. It is done like a real-tv show, the actors all stayed in character and made the story believable. It you like stuff like ""Jackass"" then this movie is worth a watch. It is not a stupid as the stunts done on ""Jackass"" but it is full of pranks like that. The movie script is based on a real town in Ohio that is reputed to have had some strange things happen there. And the town was and I think still is named Helltown. I liked how it ended, it was true in the cause and effects of what would have to happen in the world of this story, ""hollywood"" techniques did not magically drop in and rescue any of the characters from the situations they found themselves in. Watch it. It is not bad."
1,WORST HORROR FILM I'VE SEEN,This movie was absolutely terrible! I don't usually write reviews but I had to on this. Rented it b/c it got high marks and was thoroughly bored and disappointed. It was a waste of my time and money. The teens were not funny in their pranks nor was it horrific in any sense. It was just a waste!
5,Quick and cheap,"I bought this book in a very good price, and it got quickly and in good condition. It was really a good deal. I recommend."
5,such a great book,These books are a treasure. I had been collecting them for years from Parent's magazine when my children were young but they were all lost. How wonderful to be able to replace some of the more precious ones. The book arrived rapidly and was in good condition as described and a great value.
1,Don't Buy this,This picture frame stopped working after a week or two of use. I have emailed and called the company SmartParts three times with no response. The fourth call resulted in voice mailbox full.
1,They give no support and phone number says unavailable.,"All I can say is stay away from this company. This review applies to their entire line. Their support is horrible. They hide their contact phone numbers well on their web site. Once you do find them, the customer service number says this number is temporarily unavailable. You call the tech support you get a message that says they're too busy, leave your name and number. My frame turns itself on by itself, yet no timers are set. There are not any firmware updates for my smart parts frame. I reccomend you look into another brand."
3,"Easy, simple, wellbuilt, but bad contrast","This frame is good looking, decent sized, and very well built. The picture quality is superb when given a high quality JPEG (I use the maximum quality setting when exporting JPEGs, sized to a maximum of 480 pixels so the frame doesn't have to do much processing when it resizes - and to fit lots of pictures on a single SD card). An excellent purchase for the price. The only downside is that the contrast is way off, with no way to adjust it (even if you open it up). Anything above about 75% saturation is completely blown out. Other than that, I'm very happy with it. Well... except a weird message about starting at picture 850 on a 2 GB card with ~1200 photos on it. I didn't verify that it was actually not displaying pictures, since the controls are simple (by design), and I wasn't about to single-step through all of them."
4,The Ideal screw driver,"This is a handy screw driver, You can set it to ratchet either way or lock it to work like a conventional screw driver. I like to leave it locked and use the wire nut end to swivel the driver on my palm so I only need to use one hand. The one drawback is it's size, It won't fit in some spots where a conventional driver will."
2,Rachet more hindrance than help,"I've just gotten started in commercial electrical work, and bought one of these on the advice of some more experienced brothers. I have to say that while in theory, this tool would make make-up much less of a chore, when the ratcheting wire nut driver fails every third wire nut, it just becomes a hindrance. The ratchet in the screwdriver shaft fails just as often, though I tend to just lock that out to avoid the headache. Maybe I'll be taking mine back, since it seems the other reviewers aren't having trouble with theirs."
2,This book was the kiss of death!,"The writing in this book was truly terrible. There wasbasically 200 pointless pages in which the cast of one-dimensionalcharacters went on and on about how wonderful Rebecca was (and I didn't particuarly think she was all that great). Then there were ten pages that were somewhat interesting (and earned the second star, since they sparked a bit of interest). This was one of the worst books I have read in a long time. It wasn't even suspensful, or scary, and it's supposed to be a horror book!"
4,Photographs of a labor of love,"Memories of Survival is published by the daughter of a woman who survived the Nazi purges of Eastern Europe. She, probably literate mostly in Yiddish, wanted to express the horrors she saw and the relief of coming to America. She does this in embroidery of extraordinary exactness and skill. I understand that an exhibit of the actual pieces is coming to the American Visionary Arts Museum in October. A trip I'm going to make."
4,beauty in survival,"I saw Mrs. Krinitz's work at an exhibit near me. The fabric paintings are quite large and you don't really get that impression in the book. The paintings range in size from 20"" X 24"" to three feet by five feet. Many of the paintings are 3-D, and that doesn't come across, either. Nevertheless, the color and most of the texture can be seen in these photos of the paintings.My only regret is that there is no photo of Mrs. Krinitz in the book. I did see it in the exhibit and even as an old woman, she was beautiful.I'm always amazed at the courage and dignity we find among those who have suffered greatly. Mrs. Krinitz took her suffering and turned it into creative, majestic beauty that is breath-taking to behold. I thank her daughters for sharing their mother's work.Anyone interested in needlework will appreciate this book. Anyone interested in survival stories will be amazed at this one."
4,Good JB's Album,"Although this is nowhere near as good as Straight Out The Jungle and Done By The Forces Of Nature, two of the JB's best albums, Raw Deluxe is still a great effort from the JB's. The beats are more stripped down and laid-back, and the JB's chemistry is still here. Check out The Roots-produced ""Brain"", the Native Tounges reunion on ""How Ya Want It We Got It"", and the fantastic ""Jungle Brother (Stereo MC's Mix)"". If you are a fan of the JB's, you may or may not be disappointed, but this is still a good LP that deserves a listen."
4,Native Tongues fan? Don't hesitate...buy it.,"This album is very underrated and slept on.The Native Tongues posse cut, ""How You Want It We Got It"" is a must have.It's not as incredible as ""Done By The Forces Of Nature"", which is a five star classic.It's not as daring or original as ""....Remedy"", but it's a more consistent, entertaining listen than ""...Remedy"" in my opinion.A solid record from start to finish.If you're a Native Tongues fan, just get it."
3,Good old Jbeez?,"Listening to this, and then listening to any of the Jungle Brothers old stuff is a big transition. Even though the bros still kick it in this more recent album, doesn't mean that they have pumped any msg into their older stuff. In fact its gone a little raw. However, if you are a fan of the bros like I am, then you definitely want to check out Raw Deluxe.If you are a stranger to the bros then I'd start out with some of their older stuff with a bit more flavor."
3,Decent,"More standard hip-hop fare than JBeez Wit The Remedy and not as good. While production on The Remedy was bold, sometimes exciting and sometimes numbing with its originality, the production here is half-hearted and lacks creativity. The beats on Where You Wanna Go and Jungle Brother (True Blue) are good but the rest seem to have been taken straight off the B-Side of any other mediocre New York rap groups latest single. The lyrics are also disappointing for most tracks. If you like the Jungle Brothers and New York hip-hop, you'll like this album, but it is certainly not a necesary one."
4,DO NOT SLEEP ON THIS ALBUM,"it lacks luster, but it still bumps in its own way. to me, it was the last good one though. i think that the jbs should continue to create original tracks instead of trying to do the radio friendly fluff stuff. though it does seem like they had to grunt a lil bit to get into this one, they did it enough to win me over..............i do not know about you. check it out though."
2,metro faucet corkscrew,"Cheap construction, cutter doesnt work well, I gave up trying to use it. Top with screw comes out easily, would be better if not removeable.Cute but I would not recommend"
5,A Workbook That Works,"This workbook really teaches you how to use RoboHelp HTML X5. It is a super learning tool. Before you spend lots of money on a class or lots of time searching a user's guide, buy this book. You can learn at your own pace, and you will be able to use RoboHTML X5 like a pro.--in no time. I really like how the workbook makes you look back on previous, learned lessons. It enhances learning."
4,"Next Book, Please!","I just finished reading this book over the course of a week or two, and it's about the 5th book of Feinstein's that I have read. I generally enjoy his anecdotal but fact-based and breezy style, and this book is no exception. Its 500 pages cruise by effortlessly as the reader gets engrossed in the ""year in the life"" description of the inner workings of the 2004 Baltimore Ravens. The portrayals of the key men in the organization, namely GM Ozzie Newsome, Head Coach Brian Billick, his staff, and the players, appear true-to-life and are complex. These are hard-working men who dedicate themselves fully to their task of molding the best possible professional football team, given the limitations of NFL rules and the salary cap. This is a human story that is worth reading, and although the outcome of the Ravens' season was disappointing, the book was not."
2,barely average,"I have always enjoyed John Feinstein's works. I have read most of his books, and enjoyed all of them. That ends with this one. The book is repetitive in the extreme. It also includes a number of cheap shots at people that Feinstein apparently has an issue with. His attacks on people like John Madden and Dennis Miller demean the book, without adding anything of value.Another issue is that he doesn't tell us some of the things we said was the purpose of the book, such as why someone was seen as a better draft choice over another, while at the same time telling us in great detail about things that I doubt anyone cares about, such as the religious battles between the team chaplain and Peter Bouldware/Matt Stover. Overall a very disappointing look at what amounts to a rehashing of the Ravens 2004 season."
3,You'll Wait and Wait....,"What a great premise, huh? A behind the scenes look at what happens over the course of a year in an NFL football team? As a football fan, what else could you want? Well let me tell you: you're going to want more than ""Next Man Up"". If you're a passionate fan of the NFL or of the Ravens, no question you'll enjoy the read. But you'll wait and wait and wait for SOMETHING of major interest to occur. For me, it just never really happened. I will write that there were MANY interesting stories throughout the book. How the Raven's owner insists on people calling him by his first name, an infamous story about what Dan Snyder did to the Raven's Defensive Coordinator when he was with the Redskins (almost worth the book alone), and several other unique bits of insight in to life in the NFL.It just never really got in to a groove and I found myself wanting it to be over. Take a chance if you want, but don't expect too much."
3,Should Have Been Better,"Given the subject matter and unprecedented access, Feinstein should have produced a more compelling read than this somewhat plodding traversal through the Ravens 2004 season. There is little here that will strike seasoned fans as particularly revelatory, and, in typical Feinsteinese, the book glides along the surface, with little psychological depth or insight. There are some interesting observations, particularly about Dan Snyder and the sycophantic Washington press corps, but Feinstein's occasional attempts at wit are mostly painful. Not a ""bad"" book, just disappointingly mediocre."
3,Good Read,I thought overall this was a good read. It was interesting to see how teams base their decisions on what players to keep and to cut.
5,Excellent Read - One of Feinstein's Best,"I have been a Feinstein fan for a long time, and never a fan of the Ravens. It was a fascinating read, and the people that run the Ravens are very good and go about it with a lot of class.So much of the NFL presented by network TV is a myth. While there is much to be admired about many of the people who populate the NFL, it is a rough business behind the scenes as well as on the field. Feinstein is very honest about this, and does a great job explaining the brutal competition that goes on off the field as well as on."
3,Feinstein's a better talker than writer,"I've been disappointed by John Feinstein's writing before - I thought his season with Bob Knight failed to produce a high quality book. I'm disappointed again with this book. What should have been a great opportunity for an author to take a reader behind the scenes with a pro football team was squandered by this mediocre writing effort. I hear Feinstein on sports radio regularly and find him engaging and sharp, so I expect his writing to be good. But, it's not that great. I don't know whether he lacks the writing talent or fails to invest the effort required to do outstanding work. Regardless, he doesn't really deliver the goods in this book. It's long and tiresome in spite of the fact that the material seems to be interesting.I hope that future writing opportunities like this one are directed to better or more motivated writers. Unless you're a diehard Ravens fan, you can skip this one."
1,"Housing leaking, no service","I purchased SeaLife Reef Master DC500 and went to my diving trip to Egypt. Housing of the camera started leaking already on the first day. OK, we thought, let's contact the dealer and get it repaired. BUT it appeared not to be so simple. I have sent them 4 e-mails within last 3 months, but got no reply. We don't have SeaLife service in Latvia and the responsible service in USA is just not giving any attention to our attempts to contact them. So, I guess, I'll just trash the camera and forget about SeaLife. My advice to others - DON'T BUY THIS CAMERA IF YOU DON'T HAVE SEALIFE SERVICE IN YOUR COUNTRY!"
1,DC500 Leaks,"I recently purchased the DC500 to replace the Sealife Reefmaster I've had for the last 4 years. The DC500 leaked both times I used it, apparently from the lens section of the housing. It was not enough to damage the camera, but taking pictures was futile. It is being sent back to Sealife for inspection, will update on the results."
3,Earthy,These bars were okay. A little more earthy tasting than I had hoped. They did make a good breakfast on the go for me and held me over till lunch time. I didn't have the mid-morning cravings.
5,Tasty,"My favorite of the two non dairy vegan bars (all three are gluten free). When I first started eating them I thought they were too sweet as I had been eating only lara bars, but I am quite used too them now and find them very satisfying. A really nice boost and the maca is said to be very therapeutic."
1,nice design but no power,This tool looks good. It has a nice feel and does not run hot which I liked a lot. But the tool is so under powered and it bogs down even in light duty applications. Why not include some power in this tool??
1,I thought this was a POWER tool,I wish there was a review of this item available before i bought it. The power behind this tool is extremely lacking to the point that there were some screws that were too much for it to drive but even my 10 year old daughter could screw in with a regular screwdriver. A serious waste of money.
3,Virctorian erotica .. kinda Ho Hum ...,"Now this will be a fist for me to give three stars to a victorian erotic classic ..... This autobiography is a very flighty autobiography of a young Jenny and her sexual escapades.When I say escapades I mean countless liasons, so much so it would appear that this is the first Victoraian foray into pornography. Victorian erotica genearlly should have a darker hidden side, illictit sex, hidden behind closed doors and on the sly, also there is usually some elemnts of seduction, pursuit, capture and surrender...Well this book has little of any of that because Jenny and her friends generally at going at it hot and heavy after only meeting for a few minutes .....There are a series of these books and I can;t see them being worth it .... sorry ....."
5,Pure genius,Michael Hedges body of work remains a spectacular example of brilliant guitar music. With his passing in the late 90s the world was robbed of a musical genius.
5,Best condensor for vocals and acoustic instruments,This mic is perfect for recording vocals and any acoustic instruments I've thrown at it. It has a great sound and doesn't color the recordings for the most part. What you hear is what you get recorded. For the price nothing beats it for sure. Buy this microphone confidently. It's built like a beast and looks like a beauty as well. :)
1,Horrible received broken!,As soon as I got my microphone I was excited to finally record I never bought anything that expensive on Amazon and there's something shaking on the top part of the microphone as soon as I received the item the box was also ripped looks like someone used it the microphone doesn't even work biggest disappointment ever the worst experience I ever had on Amazon now I'm stuck here not able to record
5,Fun Mind Games,"These are fun games with multiple levels. You can select easy to get a quick hit of Sudoku or Kakuro and go all the way to difficult if you want to spend some time and brain power. No fancy graphics, so quick load time - love it."
4,commercial invoice,good afternoon to miami Product arrived in perfect condition. I just need to send the invoice. thanks. good afternoon to miami Product arrived in perfect condition. I just need to send the invoice. thanks. good afternoon to miami Product arrived in perfect condition. I just need to send the invoice. thanks
1,Lasted about 2 minutes,"The machine worked good for about 2 minutes. Then it started making a strange noise and two minutes later, the foam applicator literally disintegrated splattering wax all over the car, including the plastic and the windshield. It may be the provided applicator was defective, but 2 minutes is ridiculous for a brand new product."
2,costly replacement pads,"I gave this to my dad for xmas. At first he was really psyched. It worked well the first time that he used it, but you need to replace the pads everytime you use it and it does not come with any extras. When he searched around for replacement pads he found it almost impossible to locate them at a hardware or electronics store. The best that he could do was have them ordered, which cost a ridiculous amount of money. It's just like home printers for your computer: the actual printer is really affordable, but where they get you is the cost of the ink cartridge. I guess B&D took a peice out of the hewlett packard business model."
1,Disappointing,"I had this machine for a couple of years, i had the brand new one replaced just in the first week, #1, they gave me a re-conditioned machine, #2, i used it like twice a year and i find that if u use it for more than 15 mins, the speed decreases. #3, it had this knocking noise back after 3 years....."
2,Don't Like it.,"Don't like the applicator bonnet. It's made of foam & fit's really, really tight so it ripped the first time I took it off. There are no paint stores, or auto parts stores that sell applicator bonnets, you have to order from the internet & those were very difficult to find. The buffer wool bonnets have enough wiggle room so they are easily removed. Bottom line, don't like it..should be able to find the bonnets in stores."
3,Would have liked one with variable speed,"After seeing viedos online which showed how to use a orbital buffer, I tried using Meguiar's Gold class liquid polish with this buffer.Applying polish with this is difficult as the motor spins very fast and results in polish flying out if you are not carefull.A buffer with variable speed would solve this problem.Also the polish strap on pads supplied with this buffer are of very cheap quailty and cannot be used to apply polish. The buffer strap on pads are ok."
5,Bought for Massage / Workout Use - I'm a professional,I have been seeing workout sites reccomending using the Orbital Buffers as they do as good if not a better job for massaging / workout out kinks and muscular scar tissue as well as the $200 professional massagers. I have started using it on my more daring clients and friends and they are all loving it. Highly reccomend if you go this route.
2,Save your money,"If you want to polish anything more than half your car, save your money and buy something else. The problem isn't the tool...it's cheaply made but you get what you pay for...the problem is you can't buy replacement foam pads ANYWHERE except by mail order from B & D. Or, buy two of them and you can get the whole car done."
2,Good design but my unit had a flaw,"I like the handles on this polisher. It's easy to hold when working on the side of the car and easy to extend one handed on the roof. The problem I had is that when I tried to remove the pad (a cotton pad with elastic ring) from the machine, the rubber piece peeled right off the machine. The rubber pad is just glued onto the plastic part of the spindle.Rather than try to send it back, I've re-attached the rubber pad using Gorilla Glue. So far it's working. I don't see other complaints about this so perhaps was just a mfg. defect on my particular unit."
2,Order incomplete,"Great to have the book. However, it was to have the pull-out poster which is missing. Now I have to return the book.Not happy about that."
5,Wonderful for preschoolers through elementary children!,"Some of us remember having ""Babar"" books read to us when we were children. This book rekindles those warm thoughts while providing an interesting, entertaining look at art and life."
4,Elephants on Parade,My 4 year old granddaughter loves the book. I enjoyed seeing many famous works of art converted to elephant-views of the world -- a refreshing reframing of the familiar. All ages can benefit from this.
2,Well what a real let down!,"When I pick up a book about the Holy Roman Empire I expect to read something about the early years of the empire, the height of the empire and the fall of the empire, but all of this was covered in one chapter. Instead the Viscount focuses on the modern day descendants of the old heroes. HOW BORING!!! I really think there could be something a little better in it. And also the Schwarzenbergs, I mean who were they?? They certainly weren't interesting, (except Karl-Philip I) who was very interesting, actually. But all in all I thought it wasa terrible book."
5,GREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAT,"I have read and heard about Telerad Red Dot finders for years but never thought them worth the bother or the expense.Shows how little I know.I have two Meade GOTO scopes and one Celestron and have been using the supplied finderscopes with no real complaint but in my old age I guess have found it more difficult to get and keep the finder scope and the telescope in harmony and as a result have had some frustration.Do I decided to try this unit out and ordered one for my Meade 7"" Mak.It works PERFECTLY""It is easy to adjust as you go along and as a result, my initial alignment was done and over in three minutes and everything was spot on and dead center in the scope, making for a most enjoyable viewing session despite a moon that was so bright you could have played a night baseball game beneath it.My other scopes will soon be equipped with an identical finderGary Hutchinson"
5,Easy alignment,"I use the Telrad finder on my 8"" SCT and 80mm refractor. The base for the finder is easy to mount on the scopes using the stick tape on the base. The three adjustment knobs make it easy to align the finder with the scope optically. The adjustable brightness of the recticle is great for centering the dimmer stars. I would not hesitate to recommend this finder to anyone."
3,Too big,It works and many people love these... but beware that it won't even fit on a smaller scope tube. I ended up returning it and buying a green laser pointer which I'm 100% impressed with. You need to find the special bracket to mount a GLP (from Orion).
5,Best unit power finder for telescopes.,"Second one for me. A must have for pointing telescopes of all kinds. A little big, but always reliable. The pulsing unit available is also a must have. Takes five minutes to install. Makes pointing at fainter naked eye stars sooo much easier. Telrad and pulsing unit arrived at/before expected ship date. Way to go Amazon, and Adoroma."
5,Excellent Source,"Elizabeth has captured so much in this poignant book of help for when a child has died. Bereaved parents can fully relate to the feelings of sorrow and despair and yet gain comfort from knowing that others have continued to live on in spite of the 'worst loss'. This is a book all bereaved parents should own. The chapters are short, the writing style easy to read and the pages packed with hope."
5,Incredible Read,"After experiencing our own devastating losses, this book comforts me still. I highly recommend it to anyone who has lost a child, from conception to adulthood. You are never alone in your grief. Your life will go on. GB"
2,"Rambling, Hard-to-Follow Book Only Minimally Helpful","This book was not very helpful in coping with the loss of my child, who died recently from cancer at the age of four. (Brain tumor) The book rambles and jerks from scene to scene, taking you to different losses of children from around the world and throughout time. It actually made me more sad. The foreword by Rabbi Harold Kushner was more helpful. I would not recommend this book to the newly bereaved parent."
4,Very helpful,I lost my 10 month old son a year ago to heart disease. I found this book very helpful/comforting. Many of the items 'rang true' for me. I would pick it up and dip into a couple of chapters at a time.
2,Don't bother,"After the death of my 24 yr old son in September 2000 I was desperate for some relief from my grief. I read several books on the loss of a child. This was the worst one. I felt cheated after reading it, I wish I could have gotten my money back. The book that helped the most was ""The Bereaved Parent."""
1,Doesn't Work Well At All!,"This stuff does not live up to it's expectations as dipicted in their TV commercials. If anything, it left my feet even drier & more scaly than before I used it!! (Many applications were applied). Most people have petroleum jelly (Vaseline) in their medicine cabinets. I suggest slopping that on your feet instead, & save yourself some money."
1,Product Old,"I ordered a big quantity of the body wash and was very disappointed, the product smells bad. I have been using this for over 2 years and it never had such an odd odor. The product smells old. Its so bad I cant use it. What a waste of money and shipping. Disappointed."
3,Not bad,"I enjoyed the characters and at first it felt the book didn't really describe enough to get clear images in my head, and it bothered me that I wasn't tuned in at times to how a character was thinking, but it did slowly improve as written wise. I read through it fast, and at first it was because I wanted to read it constantly but then at some point that took a turn and I only wanted to hurry and finish it because I didn't want to read it anymore.It's probably only because I'm not very sexual so I couldn't understand why someone would do some things that happened in the book, also some things were a little silly in my opinion, but I don't think it should cause anyone to hesitate in purchasing the book, I may try this authors other book."
5,None,this was a great read. i dont read much but finally a book i couldnt put down. if this was made into a movie i would watch it so much i would know it word for word.
5,Enjoy a little Sci-Fi,"I'm not a Sci-Fi reader, but this novel was good.Strategy, battles and special powers makes this an intriguing novel."
1,Boring,"Since I am post-menopausal I thought I'd really enjoy this book -I ABSOLUTELY did NOT! I found the main character exceptionally dull, and her friends sterotyped. This book was more about her friend's problem and emails about grandchildren rather than a REAL mystery."
3,Good not great,I liked the music on this cd for the most part. I think that if some other things were done with vocals this cd could be brought to a whole other level.
3,nikon - no longer the underdog,there was a time when nikon was the underdog (to the evil empire known as c*non).but that has changed.Nikon D90 DX 12.3MP Digital SLR Camera with 18-105mm f/3.5-5.6G ED AF-S VR DX Nikkor Zoom Lenscase in point
2,Too many errors,"This book is helpful with the basics, but the amount of errors located throughout really makes you second guess the author/editors. I recommend going with the Nikon D50 Field Guide, and skipping the Magic Lantern Guide."
1,"Not really a ""How to"" book","This book is a real deception.It is compound of several old interviews about how other people got rich in the Internet without giving any real specific details. Finally, the author uses 50 pages of the book you are paying for to promote other products.Yes, I regret that I bought this book."
1,Blatant attempt to get readers to spend more money,"Having read this book and attended an ""internet summit"" with Ted Ciuba this book does not provide the solution to getting rich on the internet, rather it promotes more of the products of Mr Ciuba and his buddies. This of course is making Mr Ciuba and his pals wealthy but not the average joe.The information is out of date and often technically no longer valid.If you want to spend $1,000's of dollars more, Mr Ciuba and his buddies will provide you with some insights to marketing on the internet, all with a worthless freebie thrown in!Don't bother..."
5,Ted KNOWS his stuff!,"Ted Ciuba NOT ONLY explained what HE did to make money on line, he interviewed several OTHER experts that are also getting RICH on the internet!Hey, even ONE interview with someone making money online is WORTH $20! This book has SEVERAL well known(in internet marketing circles) EXPERTS that are ""walking the WALK"" as well as talking the talk.I admit it, I AM partial to Ted. He has helped ME become MORE successful on the internet. Now, let him and the others in the book help YOU! For such a SMALL price as well!All the best to you!"

2,Environmentally hostile,"Well, it's an average cordless screwdriver, but what bugs me is that, like other B&D products, it's impossible to replace the battery, so you have to buy a new one and toss a perfectly good product into a landfill (after recycling the dead battery, of course). Maybe I'm cynical, but it looks like this is a deliberate marketing strategy on the part of B&D to help their sales figures. It's the last B&D product I'll buy."
4,Durable,"I bought the thing as a spur of the moment purchase. I ended up loving this little thing. Ive done major remoldeling jobs (my kitchen, and bathroom using it. Ive even used it to hammer things with, as a quick tool. I ve had it for over two years, and it still is going strong, except I did break off the end battery cover piece. I give it 4 stars only because I do wish battery life was a bit longer."
2,"good design, limited power","This is a really good design for a cordless screwdriver, but it runs out of battery power very quickly. Don't plan on it for big jobs. Since the battery is contained in the screwdriver, all you can do is plug the whole unit into the charger. I had one of the older models from black and decker and although you couldn't fit it into tight places, you could swap out batteries and keep on working."
1,Can't replace battery,"I bought this just over two years ago. I really liked the unit but like a lot of other users have said, the battery doesn't stay charged for over a couple of weeks. But you can't use it while it is plugged in and it takes too long to wait for it to charge up when you need it.Anyway, the battery is completely dead now and I cannot find a replacement anywhere. The sad thing is that you can take the battery pack out of it very easily.I really HATE to throw away anything because the battery dies! So much for Earth Day. All the landfills are full of good working equipment."
1,With a product this bad why not just use a regular screw driver?,I am shocked that no one else has mentioned any gripes about the bit falling out all the time (why couldn't B&D have added a way to lock the bit into place?) and I never know if the battery has enough juice or if it is even charging since there is not indicator on the screwdriver. In addition it sucks that you can't use the screwdriver as a non-cordless device and draw AC power from the wall. It's really a terrible product.
1,Don't waste your money,Theres better products out there than this one.Batteries do not hold a charge very long.Mine went to the trash can after a years use.
1,"no power at all, complete trash.... will return tomorrow.","I just got this in the mail today. charged it and boy is this a piece of trash. I have 8 Conceal bookshelves and installed 2 by hand but when i tried with this thing it was a joke and a waste of time. it did not have the power to drill a simple hole into drywall. a hole just like one i had made the day before with a simple hand screw driver. this is a complete and total waste of money. THIS THING HAS NO POWER, and the torque makes no difference at all. none.my friend had a black and decker drill, it worked great, but after the time wasting and problematic experience i will not touch this black and decker save to smash it to little tiny bits."
1,Tiny torque; battery drain; can't use while plugged in,"Forget about this product. Because the battery drains when not in use, it won't be ready for you to use. And it won't work while plugged into the charger. So, if you need it in your toolbox, you better plan about 4hrs ahead of time before you need it. And even then, the torque is so weak you'll end up screwing things in by hand anyway. A poor execution of a good idea."
5,Wonderful product,"I use this device everyday. No problems with it at all. Makes a great addition to your tool box. Not real heavy duty, but not meant to be. Saves my wrist from repetitive injuries."
1,spend a few more dollars and get a good one,"The collar which holds the bit is too short and they continually fall out. Additinally, the charge is very weak and won't be long enough for most jobs. Don't even think about trying to drill with this. I am now shopping for a better one."
4,Utensil Holder,This wasn't big enough to hold all the utensils I wanted to put in it so I used it to put the dishwashing sponge and drain holders in.
2,Utensil holder,I did not like this at all. It is very cheap looking. I did not end up using it. I bought a much nicer one a target. I don't recommend this.
2,Spaces too wide on side - most utensil handles slip through,I thought this utensil holder would look great. I didn't consider the fact that the spaces on the sides are so wide that all utensil handles slip through. You have to put them in especially carefully in order for the utensil handle ends to hit the ~1-inch lip at the bottom. That too much precision for a kitchen...
3,No Lap Counter = No Fun,"Whoever reissued Sizzlers never played with them as a kid.The cars are fast. An average lap is about 2-4 seconds. The trick of racing is in juicing your car at the right time (especially if only one juicer is available, resulting in wrestling fights breaking out amongst friends and siblings battling for the juicer). Also, the lap counter funnels down to a single lane so the cars crash into each other occasionally and fly off the track.With this setup you'll just be watching fast little cars whiz around the track really fast, going, ""Man, I have no idea what's going on."" Sorry, no lap counter, means no fun."
3,older was better,"we bought a california 500 set in 1971..the whole family had there own car and we raced all the time, it was great family fun...divorce in 1978.so have no idea what ever happened to set...bought a new set for grandkids in december of 2006...no lap counter..no race starter...without these 2 items..it took most of the fun out of race set."
2,Good idea but.......,The cars are fast is a lot of fun with my 5 year old watching them speed around the track. The problem is the cars don't always charge that well. I bought 6 cars and 2 of them don't work and they all don't get an even charge. Some cars are fast while others are slow.But the biggest problem is the track is terrible. The straight pieces don't fit together well and are wavy causing the cars to fly off the track. The machine they use to cut the pieces must be misaligned. I returned 1 race set to Target and got another and had the same problem. Great idea but very poor QA.
1,Disappointed,I am very disappointed with this product. The arms don't stay closed in position when using it round the neck. My main purpose was to get it so my old mother could use it hands free round her neck but she can't as the arms keep popping out. Its quite inconvenient. I tried to stick the arms but that doesnt help either. The locks to keep the arms in place are too flimsy that's why they don't stay in place. I would not recommed buying this unless you are going to use it propped on a table.
2,Verified Purchase,"As Seen On TV Lighted Magnifier Perfect for hands free ReadingNeed is GREAT !Concept is excellent .Construction good , but result is lacking since people with LOW VISION need much more light than provided ."
1,Lighted Magnifier,"This item should not even be considered as a toy. Do not waste your money. I am of the opinion that this is a copy of the original and not the real thing. The manification is blurred at any angle and the lights never did work. In as much as I hate to be negative on anything, this one deserves a big fat ""Zero."""
4,I bought this item for a gift,"I bought this item for a friend who had stopped reading books because even with reading glasses it was straining her eyes. The fact that she doesn't have to hold it (like other pg size magnefiers) and that it had a lite built in was just great. She really likes it a lot. I just wish the batteries were a little easier to change. Overall a good product, and it got here quickly."
5,Love it.,We bought this for my husband who engraves mirrors and needed help seeing some of the smaller lines. This lighted magnifier worked perfectly
1,Too much rubato to use for any dance class!,"This recording disappoints because right in the first track for plie, the pianist can not hold a steady tempo. It has way too much rubato which slows down and speeds up in a way that doesn't give you a steady tempo to work with. Has this guy ever played for a ballet class before? Disappointing."
1,Not Nourishing,I like to think that I have normal hair that is neither too oily or too dry. This shampoo paired with the conditioner strip my hair of all oils. My hair became very brittle and would break upon extended use of this product. I would not recommend this.
2,smells good,"Hmm firts of all the shampoo smells great, and thats all. I used it twice and both times i notice how dry it would leave my hair. I cant bare to use it anymore on my hair nor give it away to someone else because i dont consider it a good product so i resorted to use it to wash my makeup brushes and even my brushes feel dry after."
1,Horrible Product,"This product smelled really good but thats the only good part. I have long hair and when I got out of the shower it was in a huge rats nest, even after I brushed it before getting in the shower. I sprayed tons of leave in conditioner on it and still hard a hard time getting a brush through it. After it dried it was limp and gross feeling. Do not recommend at all."
2,Not Worth the Great Smell,"It smelled wonderful, but it completely dried out my hair. Gave me the worst dandruff I ever experienced in my life."
4,awesome for fine thin flat hair,"I have naturally oily hair on the top with dry ends...this shampoo and conditioner does not cause heaviness that weigh your hair down yet if you leave it in for 3 mins it really hydrates the dried ends. I must admit you have to be very liberal with the amounts, patient enough to let the conditioner sit, and must rinse well."
1,Dried and Damaged Hair,"I indulged myself with this shampoo thinking that it would be good for my hair to get some t&t after being stressed. I don't blow dry my hair or use a flat iron but this shampoo dried out my hair beyond belief. After less than a month my boyfriend wouldn't put his arm around me because my hair was to rough, whenever I wore it down it frizzed out, and I couldn't stop itching my head, I've never had such a problem with my hair before. Eventually I had to cut off 5"" because it was to damaged to be saved. I changed to another shampoo for dry and damaged hair to help save it so I didn't have to cut off more, it worked, but eventually I did have to cut off the rest of the damaged part of my hair, luckily it's grown out now. I gave it to my boyfriends dad to use on the dog. Definitely not worth the hassle or the pain for 5 minutes of fancy smelling hair."
1,It smells good...,"but that's about it. I love the smell of tea tea and that is what attracted me to this shampoo, but it doesn't actually hydrate my hair at all. It actually makes my hair feel slightly dry and almost as if it has been washed with water. The gorgeous smell only lasts for about 10 minutes as well. I even got my friend to smell my hair this morning after I used this shampoo and she said it doesn't smell like tea tree at all. The same goes for all of the Organix shampoos I guess because she has the same in lavender and her hair doesn't smell like lavender :/ Sorry but don't waste your money."
2,"Drying, not hydrating!","I have normal hair with slightly dry ends, and this may be the worst ""hydrating"" shampoo and conditioner I have ever used. The shampoo was slightly better than the conditioner in that it didn't leave my hair any worse off than it started. The conditioner, on the other hand, did not moisturize or detangle at all. I'm not joking. When I combed it through my hair it didn't even feel different than using water. The smell is inoffensive though, which is why I tried it in the first place."
3,** These reviews are for different items ***,"Read these reviews and then take them with a grain of salt. This page of reviews are for all different ""Organix"" products. I wanted to read up on the Brazilian Keratin Therapy"" shampoo but I noticed that these reviews are for all different shampoos and Organix items. Look close, but better yet, find a different site that has their reviews sorted out for the item that you're researching."
4,Soothing & healing shampoo,"I have had itching issues with my hair for some times , read about this shampoo and purchased thru Amazon, used it since last six months, itching is gone , hair has more body , it Amazed my dermetologist."
4,Smells Grrrrrreat!,"This seems to be a good clarifying shampoo. It doesn't lather well, but I find that it gets my hair extremely clean without using extra product despite the lack of lather. The smell is wooooooonderful, but the scent goes away after you rinse. The conditioner, however, leaves behind the scent and detangles my hair without weighing it down. My hair ends up feeling clean and smooth (my hair is super straight), and I find myself sniffing my hair all day long. I think you really need to use conditioner each time you shampoo, otherwise your hair will be a tangled mess without it."
2,Not For Normal To Dry Hair,"This shampoo has a great smell, but it is not nourishing nor will it make you hair stronger. It will actually break your hair. I have untreated hair slightly on the dry side and I was looking for a cruelty-free, conditioning shampoo, and this coconut shampoo made my hair extremely dry. I couldn't even run my comb through it even after using a deep conditioner. I would recommend this shampoo for someone with short and very oily hair. It'll make your hair squeaky clean. I will use it once a month to get the build up out. It does lather well and smells like light pure coconut. I also checked it on the EWG website and was not pleased with the ratings. A 4 rating is fine, but the cancer level was moderate.[...]"
2,Tangled Mess...,"I got the Organix Shampoo Cherry Blossom Ginseng 13 oz. Shampoo and Conditioner because it's organic and smelled wonderful! WELL...The smell, like others have said, does not go beyond the bottle and when I got out of my shower my hair was a tangeld up mess! the conditoner did nothing to make my hair smooth, shiny or conditioned. My hair felt brittle and just horrible. I am really upset because I paid 6$ each at Acme for these bottles..."
5,Great Product,"I love the Organix Line because they are low priced and smell good. This has a very light and refreshing, summery fragrance that is not too overwhelming. I have long, thick hair and this shampoo does a good job at lathering and cleaning my hair. I follow up with the Organix cucumber yogurt conditioner, which could do a little better job at detangling, but this seems to be the case with all Organix conditioners as they are a little thin. But overall this is another great shampoo from Organix."
2,Does Not Make Hair Soft and Silky,"I tried this shampoo, hoping that it would make my frizzy hair softer and silkier like the bottle said it would, but boy, was I dissapointed. I've tried four of Organix's shampoos, and this is the only one I've been dissapointed with.Instead of making my hair soft, it felt hard, like I had just sprayed a lot of hair spray on. The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is because it does smell good, which is the only good thing about this shampoo."
4,Great English lavender smell!,Did not feel conditioning during the shampooing process also it was a little hard to comb threw but the end result was good but not very moisterizing. this seems to be geared for those needing to strengthen their hair. not good if you need lots of moisture. gives you wonderful shine and hair smells great even dry!
1,Drying,like some people have said both this shampoo and conditioner has stripped my hair of its oil and dried it up. I have very thick curly hair and it's dried out my curls to the point where they're not defined anymore.
2,Very disappointed,"I bought this with high hopes but was let down. It left my hair (which is pretty thick and straightish with a wave, and color treated) feeling DRY of all things! I was really surprised. It helps smooth it out but doesn't feel silky, nourished or soft as I imagined. The scent is a little iffy also. Won't buy it again."
1,"Very drying, not at all happy with this shampoo","I bought this shampoo because it was on sale and I thought it might be good. Boy was I wrong! For months, I was having a terrible case of dry scalp and I thought it was due to stress or other things. Now that I changed shampoos and have not been using it for a few weeks, my scalp is back to normal. Thank goodness. It is great in principal--the ingredients seem good--but it did not work for me."
5,The BEST Shampoo Ever!,"I bought this shampoo as a last ditch effort. I've been a disgruntled consumer of shampoos for a while now, and let me say, I've bought them all. From Kerastase, to Biolage, to Redken, Rusk, Garnier, Tigi, Pantene - you name it. Some were so-so, while many were so full of sulfate-based ingredients, leaving me with rashes on my scalp and hives (I'm allergic). Organix was the first shampoo I've ever noticed to actually say, ""Sulfate Free"" on its packaging. After one use, I was totally amazed - my normally dry and course hair was silky soft and shiny. This will be the only shampoo I'll ever use, and I encourage others to give it a try - they're currently offering a FULL rebate, so what do you have to lose?!?"
1,Made my hair like straw,"I bought this shampoo, (and the complimentary conditioner) after reading tons of reviews on various sites raving about this product. I was sorely disappointed. Yes it smells good but that's about where the pros end. It left my hair feeling very very dry. It felt like straw. I made sure to wash it our really well and yet it still felt like there was tons of product in it and was gross to touch. I do not recommend this product."
1,Dried my hair out,My hair has always had a healthy sheen and shine to it as well as a good stretch. I noticed since changing to this shampoo and conditioner that my hair has gotten steadily worse and more tangled and brittle!!! I'm stopping using this immediately. I've never had my hair just snap at the slightest pull.
1,One of the worst Shampoos/Conditioner I have ever used.,"I just tried the Organix Argan Oil Shampoo and Conditioner; it is the worst shampoo/conditioner I have ever used. Dollar shampoos work better.I got no real lather from the shampoo and the conditioner left my hair so dry I had to use my Biolage after. Do not waste your' money on this brand, the only reason any magazine suggests to try this is because Vogue is in control of the brand and the Vogue name carries a huge amount of weight and puts pressure on the industry to advertise for them."
2,My experience with this shampoo and conditioner,"I have been using the Organix Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy 13. oz shampoo as well as the matching conditioner. The shampoo does a good job in making my hair feel very clean and getting nice and foamy. However it feels like it dries my hair out a little bit and that the conditioner doesn't leave my hair very soft. The products smell very coconut like but after using this product for 2 weeks just to get my money's worth , I wouldn't continue buying it."
2,No real lavender scent,"When I bought this product, I expected it to have the scent of the essential oil, lavender. However, it has almost no discernible sent, maybe it's the addition of the soymilk, but I was very dissapointed. I ended up adding my own essential lavender oil, but I won't buy this product again."
2,Two stars only because it smells pretty good.,"I was attracted to this shampoo because it smelled pretty good, and I've heard really good things about using a sulfate-free shampoo. The shampoo made me hair smell great, and it worked well the first couple of times. Over the last two months or so, it seems like my hair has gotten weaker and dryer. It seems like I've been shedding A LOT. Once I switched to a different shampoo, my hair feels so much better.For reference, I have coarse, thick, wavy hair."
1,"Great smell, but it dried out my hair","To be fair, I tried this product after years of using Matrix Biolage (a REALLY good product used in salons), so chances are I wouldn't have liked most other shampoos. But I wanted to try something different and save money, and this product smells so good that I gave it a try.Never again. Like other reviewers with straight, fine hair, I found that my hair feels like straw after using the Coconut Milk shampoo just two times. I didn't use a conditioner because I haven't for years. Also, I air-dry my hair, don't use curling irons and my hair isn't colored or permed.I thought this shampoo would be less expensive than Biolage, too, but it's not. The 13-oz. bottle of Organix cost just under $7 locally, and a 33.8-oz. bottle of Biolage is around $20. The Biolage is concentrated so I use less and I don't need a conditioner. Lesson learned!"
5,Amazing product!,"I was in safeway looking for a decent hair product that could manage my dyed and fried hair. My hair is bad enough that letting it air dry leaves it a poofy frizzy unmanagable mess. I've tried all the cheaper ones(4 bucks and under) to no avail, most left my hair in worse condition then when I started.I saw this was on sale buy one get one and figured it was worth a shot. I did not have high hopes. I picked up the shampoo and conditioner, and having been using it for two days now. My hair is already softer, less frizzy and shiny. I've also already noticed far less breakage.I picked up the anti breakage serum tonight and am trying that out. For the price this is an amazing product one i will for sure be keeping in my house from now on."
2,Dry Scalp,"I have been using the blue version of this shampoo and conditioner for over a month now and just yesterday I noticed I have a very dry scalp. I have never seen my scalp as such. I don't have the relevant knowledge in science or chemistry to understand which shampoos and conditioners are best for what kind of hair but I assumed, based of what what written, that it was ""rich in nutrients."" Guess I was wrong. I haven't noticed anything different with my hair, but scalp dryness is no good."
2,"Overpriced, low quality, very disappointed","I bought this with the matching conditioner because of a ""buy one get one free"" promotion. I had always liked the smell, but hated the idea of spending 7 dollars on a small bottle of shampoo.First, the scent you smell in the bottle doesn't stay in your hair at all. Sure, you can smell it when your hair is still wet, but once it's dry, there is almost NO SMELL.Second, this shampoo barely produces any lather. You have to use a large amount, which ends up weighing your hair down, and making it look greasy. This is WITHOUT using the conditioner!Honestly.....using this shampoo makes your hair look, feel, and smell like you haven't washed it at all. Complete waste of money."
2,Terrible :(,Rinsing the shampoo and conditioner off right away makes your hair feel tangling. Seriously takes me forever to brush my hair and I have never had that problem with any other shampoo I've used. Smells great but not worth the money.
1,STAY AWAY FROM THIS SHAMPOO!!!,Seriously this shampoo works like a clairifying one; It will completely strip your hair of moisture and leave it feeling like straw. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT!
2,Smells good but leaves my hair dry,"While this shampoo and conditioner set smell really good (Cherry Blossom), they leave my hair completely dry and full of static. In order to get even a little bit of moisture, I have to use 3 times the normal amount of conditioner in my hair everyday. I have very fine hair, and this shampoo and conditioner makes it seem thinner and frizzy. Will never buy this product again."
2,Expected better...,"I bought this shampoo mainly because of the smell and because it wasn't too expensive. I was very disappointed that it didn't do anything that it promised to do, but it smelled yummy so I still used it. It stripped my hair badly every time I used it, and totally dried out my scalp. I ended up having to alternate between using this one and another shampoo. I will say that the Shea Butter conditioner is fabulous, but this shampoo is not worth it."
4,"Like the shampoo, but you must alternate or it will become drying","* Organix Brazilian Keratin Therapy Shampoo and Conditioner, like all other keratin protein shampoos are good, but you must alternate with other moisturizing shampoos without protein or it will become drying* I will use may be once per week, then I use my other brands like Matrix Sleek, Biolage Hydramoisture, Fructis Triple Nutrition or Pantene Blonde/Brunette Expressions, or Suave Humectant* It is a light brown sugar gel consistency* I also like to change it out and use the Moroccan Argan Oil Shampoo and Conditioner that provides the right amount of body or volume* The Coconut Shampoo and Conditioner is also hydrating and worked fine too."
3,Hawaii for your Head,"Using this shampoo is like taking a head-trip to Hawaii. Inhaling the rich, sweet coconut milk scent of this shampoo reminds ms of a splendid, sunny day I spent on Waikiki, slathering Hawaiian Tropics all over my skin and thinking of absolutely nothing but the sun, sand, and surf. Everytime I lather this creamy, milky shampoo into my hair, I forget I am standing in a freezing bathroom in Alaska and slip into a delicious fantasy of me bathing in a waterfall in Kauai!There is one warning about this shampoo though: it cleanses your hair like a clarifying shampoo. It leaves your hair very clean but a tad on the dry side like when you use a clarifying shampoo. I use a great conditioner from Aveda - one that has a coconut, grapefruit scent and it works great."
1,HORRIBLE,DOES NOT LATHER UP AT ALL. HARD TO TELL IF IT IS EVEN IN YOUR HAIR. ONE CHECK BECAUSE IT SMELLS OK.
2,Dangerous Chemicals,"If you don't care about hazardous chemicals getting absorbed into your body while using this product, use it, because it does work well. Most people see that it is ""Sulfate Free"" and they assume it doesn't have harmful chemicals. That is an incorrect assumption!"
2,"Good shampoo, horrible scent!!",This shampoo makes your hair soft and shiney (which is what I was going for). BUT I cannot live with the scent. I read in one review that it smelled like a men's locker room but I tried it anyway. It's not so bad during use or right after but as your hair dries and forever after that it smells worse than a men's locker room! I quit using it after three tries.
2,Don't bother trying this product.,"I wanted to try something new so I bought the Organix coconut shampoo, conditioner, and the leave in split ends meander. The first time I used the shampoo and conditioner. My hair was literally in knots as it dried which forced me to get a nice haircut. The shampoo makes my hair really hard, dry, and rough. It really feels like straw. The conditioner makes my hair somewhat softer. These products smell great but its drying out my hair. I've only used it twice but do not recommend it."
2,"Great smell, but not so great product","I bought this shampoo and the matching conditioner, because it said it provided weightless moisturizers. While the shampoo has an amazing smell, and it did provide the moisturizers they were not weightless by any means. My hair felt heavier and incredibly greasy after using it, I did continue to use it for about two weeks to see if it would improve but it did not. So overall I would not recommend buying this product."
4,Great if you have well water,"I've been trying several shampoos, since moving to a new house. We have well water that's very mineral, plus we use a softener that employs salt. So most shampoos give me a major buildup of film on my hair. I even tried an expensive Sebastian product. This shampoo has a pleasant frangrance and leaves my hair silky and residue free. I have fine straight hair and was able to style it much better using this shampoo with my well water. Other ""well water"" shampoos will run you about $20 a bottle, so this is a good price for a good product. The pleasant fragrance doesn't stick around long as commented upon by other reviewers, so I just spritz a bit of my favorite perfume!"
4,"Great scent, but doesn't pass on to your hair after..","I really liked the smell of this one above all other Organix hair products, but sadly the amazing scent never passed on once out of the bottle. Just FYI"
3,So-so,"It lathers better than most sulfate-free shampoos I have tried. And it smells delightful. Organix is also a little cheaper than the sulfate-free products I had been purchasing. I wish it left my hair a little smoother, but I guess that's the price you pay.Sulfate-free products tend to vary from person to person JUST like any other product. Very few people find a ""miracle"" in the same product. However, something I have observed is that people with thick and/or coarse hair (particularly African-American hair) do not seem to have good experiences with Organix. My hair is color treated, oily at the roots and dry at the ends. Overall it is fairly healthy though. It's thin (not what I would call baby fine) and naturally wavy. I rarely heat style my hair, especially during the summer months. So I wash, oil, and braid until my hair dries. When I do straighten it out, I notice it is slightly dryer with sulfate-free products than if I had used something like Biolage."
1,"If you like bad hair days, you'll love this product.","Shortly after I began using this shampoo and conditioner duo, I wondered why my hair looked so bad. Normally my hair looks great after just wash and go. I've always had healthy, shiny hair with lots of natural body. But shortly after I began using this shampoo, I was embarrassed at how it made my hair look. It was so bad it affected my self-esteem at work. My hair felt like dirty straw and looked unkempt. So I tossed it in the cabinet and grabbed my emergency bottle of cheap shampoo, and WA LA, my hair was back to it's beautiful healthy self again in no time at all. It's a shame because this stuff smells wonderful, but it just ruins my hair, so, as for me, I'll never buy it again."
2,Forget It,"I consider myself to be shampoo agnostic and will even use the stuff in the dispenser at the gym, but this stuff left my long, highlighted hair feeling like tangled straw.I shouldn't need a heavy, intensive conditioner after a shampoo unless it's a clarifier, and this isn't.The only thing to recommend it is the scent. It does smell like a sweet, freshly cracked coconut."
1,Turns my hair to straw,"I wanted to try a new shampoo. I was attracted to the bottle. It smelled good in the bottle. That is where the good things stopped. This shampoo makes my hair feel like a bundle of hay, even while still in the shower. I use extra conditioner on my hair and still have a hard time trying to comb my fingers through my hair in the shower. When I get out of the shower and try to comb my hair, it is still very tangled and dry. I have used this shampoo/conditioned for about a week. My scalp has begun to itch. I cant say for sure that its related to this product but I did not have any issues before I started using it. Normally I would give away a product that I was not fond of to someone else who might enjoy it, but this product is going straight into the trash. Save your money and your hair.. Keep on walking by this product and buy something different."
1,very disapointed,I have used this several times in hope that I would like it better.I hate it .It ties my hair in knots and it very hard to comb threw after shampooing and conditioning.It made my hair feel very coarse dry and very dull.I will go back to what I use to use.I tried this over and over with the same results.And I was soooo looking forward to this new organix line.
2,Not Recommended,"This is the worst tea tree shampoo I have ever used. There was no refreshing feeling when using it as with other tea tree shampoos. The shampoo had the strangest scent, which can only be described as an old library smell. The conditioner was nothing special. It did not detangle all that well. I have untreated hair which is almost down to my waist. The shampoo and conditioner left it feeling dry. I would not buy this again. For a good tea tree shampoo, use Paul Mitchell."
1,Horrible,"Dried out my hair, did not leave it straight. This was worse for my hair than herbal essence. Highly do not recommend."
1,Stripping and drying,"All I can say is don't waste your money! I have fine, oily scalp. I just say ugh frizz mess and very drying."
4,A nice shampoo!,"I was searching for a coconut shampoo and conditioner and this set works wonderfully. I have thick, dark hair and I am always searching for products that actually do what they claim. I love this set because the ingredient list is pretty simple and the coconut scent is absolutely divine. I really like the conditioner best, as it makes my hair very soft and manageable. It does not tangle and I don't have to ""set"" or comb it as I do after using garnier products. Overall, a good product!"
4,Amazing!,"The shampoo is absolutely amazing. The fragrance is awesome and it stays in your hair upto 24 hours after washing.Its all natural and makes your hair smoother, softer, more bouncier and the best part is, your hair don't get frizzy at all!I absolutely adore it. The only problem I had was that after washing, when I blow dried my hair, it got all sticky for a couple minutes, but later it was fine.I suggest towel drying, just in case."
5,Great content and awesome look!,"This is such a cool series. If you aren't familiar with it yet, do something about it! I have a subscription and just received issue 6... oh my goodness! The graphics are so amazing... i can't believe that every issue this thing looks better and better. If you are a shorts lover, don't miss it. If you aren't, I bet you'll become one. FilmFest has some great selections of shorts and interviews... check it out!"
3,"Good, But Slightly Dated Book of Musical Theatre Selections.","The first volume for tenors, this book strives to find great musical theatre pieces. It mostly succeeds, but sometimes fails. Unfortunately, since the book came out in 1987, it is lacking any recent songs. Some standout songs include- Being Alive (Company), Many Moons Ago (Once Upon a Mattress), On The Street Where You Live (My Fair Lady), Someone is Waiting (Company), and Younger Than Springtime (South Pacific). If you are interested in a moderately useful book of Broadway favorites before 1987, buy this book. Otherwise, check out later volumes of the same series..."
4,"Amazon, Remove the Cristind Polemic","I have never seen anything like this. Cristin Blue Davenport, of Palo Alto, child, you have the most abominable wish list on Amazon for an adult? You should have used the ""Kids Review Form."" Of the 23 items on your wish list, most are barbie dolls! Goodness, girl, someone who says ""I love kids and pigs and Ancient History,"" wouldn't understand history if God taught it to her. My reason for responding is the total inappropriateness of your DIATRIBE again a professor. This page is for reviews, not teaching evaluations. I can see why you did not read the book - you probably cannot read. Amazon should have removed this diatribe. Hope your parents see this."
4,Good for breeds,"It's great for learning about the AKC and the standards they use to grade the breeds, but what comes across the strongest is the physical features and how certain personality traits should or should not be penalized. There does not seem to be a lot of information about the dogs themselves; the closest thing to that is a short history of each breed. I also don't agree with the choke-chain training they instruct readers to use in the back of the book. All in all, a good AKC book but not much more to offer."
5,for serious dog professionals or amateurs wanting more,A good and complete dog reference. Pet owners will love a cruise through all the potential breeds to love and those seriously taking in dog shows will enjoy a complete reference.
3,"New cover, (almost) same contents.","Don't get me wrong, this book has ALOT of in-depth information about your favorite AKC breeds, but they could have atleast changed the pictures of the breeds through the book....they left the same ones they have been using forever (most everyone I could see) the only difference between this book and the previous edition is the addition of a few breeds recently accepted and different color pictures of the breeds in the special pages in the middle of the book. It's a good book, I'm not sorry that I bought it, but come on....be a little more diverse if you are going to print another adition...get creative!"
2,No longer produced,"I purchased this product for a friend, who likes this product a lot. However, it has not been made by Dove for a year or more. When I first purchased it, it was around $6. Now only a few vendors have it in stock. I only gave this 2 stars because of the ridiculous price over $17 I paid for my last order. I saw it for over $40 from one vendor. I guess there are only a few left."
3,Prodduct OK but lacked quality :-(,Order process and customer service was excellent! Product lacked quality. Had to do some extra work to get everything to align. After some extra labor they worked fine.
3,The Marshal and Mrs. O'Malley,"After her husband's murder Jo O'Malley sees no other way to get justice then to take the law into her own hands and, as it happens, Marshal Fletcher Collins shows up just in time to stop her and suggest a different course. I was frustrated by both these characters throughout most of the book. Jo is determinedly secretive for longer than she needed to be, in my opinion, and Fletcher is rigidly idealistic, in a ludicrous attempt to ignore his grief about his father. Things were so much more complicated than they needed to be, but I cannot deny that the characters were very complex and their complexities, though frustrating, were not unrealistic. I did enjoy watching them as they unravelled the mystery of Edwyn O'Malley's death together, and there were more than a few funny moments that I also enjoyed."
1,Not very exciting,"This book starts very well but after a few pages you start wondering whether you are missing the point. There are certain good stories but if you are looking for an instruction book, this is not it."
2,Unlightening,"Having read Golf in the Kingdom, and Inner Game of Golf some time ago, I looked forward to this more recent book on mental aspect of golf.My handicap has drifted up from 3 to 6 over the last year, so I was looking for a fresh approach. The day after reading the first 130 pages, I resolved to play without fear, not be upset by bad shots, and enjoy my playing partners.With OB left, trees to the right, I striped my drive on the 440 yd par 4, followed by a 5 iron to 8 feet, and drained the putt. What a great book!Four hours later I found myself in the clubhouse having shot a 90 for the first time in over 20 years, with four OBs and five 3 putts.It's a good thing that ""looking good"" was no longer important to me, as I endured the ribbing, jabs and outright taunts of several of my fellow players.I'll finish the book. But most likely you'll find it listed on the Used Books here very shortly."
5,IT REALLY WORKS,"This is an excellent book for ""taking your game to the next level"" whatever that level is. Very entertaining and enriching. A must buy!"
4,A beautifully compiled collection of Rachmaninov's gorgeous songs,"The first of recordings consisting of the complete songs of Rachmaninov, this CD includes soloists from each of the four standard voice types, soprano, mezzo, tenor and bass. It provides a lovely look into this incredible repertoire. I purchased this CD in order to have a reference as I select and study a number of pieces from this composer. The songs are unique in that they are in Russian, and the compositional style contains a wide range of the 20th Century impressionistic style so beloved by Rachmaninov.Worthy of the collection of any lover of song or of Rachmaninov."
2,Somewhat Disappointing,"My first adventure in investigative journalism, I was immediately captivated by the beginning: cast of characters, general overviews, and the excitement that, based on the overview of how the book was to go, it was worth reading. The material was well written in that Mr. Moldea went into fine and captivating detail asto what the investigators were thinking, what EVERYONE was thinking. I was a little suspicious of the passage where he describes visiting with Sirhan Sirhan, and given the result of the encounter, maybe made the author a little biased asto how his investigation would lead to. The ending left me in a completely different place, where I believe the author's evidence lead me to. His conclusions were not anything I had agreed with. I feel he made the evidence ultimately fit the official version of the tragic downfall of RFK that fateful June evening in 1968."
1,Builds up to NOTHING!,Basically he painstakingly makes you go through a tremendous amount of information just to discover that Sirhan-Sirhan is guilty. The gunpowder burns that the coroner says could only have happened if someone shot right up against the Senator is explained very creatively. It's like reading a tiny Warren Commision and having to buy into the single bullet theory again. Really a waste of time and money.
3,Frustrating conclusions,"I'll join the ranks of others that were both disappointed and frustrated with the way the author chose to sum up his theory and end this book. It's not that doubt his conclusion, but the manner in which he basically changed him mind and ended up deciding the Sirhan Sirhan acted alone and was the sole gunman, struck me as both a copout and rather suspicious in itself. Throughout the first three-quarters of this book, the author looks at all sides of the assissination, along with various conspiracy theories about what happened and who might have been involved in killing RFK. It's all quite well written and absorbing. I got caught up in the whole story all over again. I realize that the author wanted some sort of concrete conclusion for the purposes of this book, or a way to put this story to bed once and for a while, but I think with all the loose ends and unexplained aspects to this famous case, most of us are still left wondering."
2,FIRMLY BOUND,"Although I found this book a fascinating account of the assassination of Robert Kennedy, I did feel that the author was so bound and determined to make all answers fit the questions regarding the Senator's death regardless of the presentation. In reading this account, one gets the feeling that the author is so firmly bound to his view that he has narrowed his vision to only one path."
2,Lacks solid evidence to support claims.,"Although the book made for interesting reading, I found it quite repetitive - as if arguing to convince reader of author's convictions. Lacked substantial evidence to confirm theories. Total lack of cooperation by LAPD and Federal agencies certainly adds to confidence in conspiracy theories as this book puts forward. Sirhan being a ""Manchurian Candidate"" seems to be more valid than multiple guns and/or assasins."
4,Comprehensive and exhaustive research...,"If you're interested in the almost minute-by-minute details of the RFK assasination and the subsequent investigation (along with all the conspiracy theories) than this is for you...I personally was happy to see Moldea go exclusively from a conspiracy mind-set to the correct (in my opinion...I can't imagine another shooter in such a crowded/cramped Ambassador Hotel kitchen) conclusion that Sirhan was the lone gunman. He seems to offer logical conclusions to most of the evidence, however, I do see what some of the other reviewers' point is...he sets about proving conspiracy, than reverses his opinion without re-evaluating some of his earlier conclusions. Overall, an excellent account of one of our darkest days, Moldea succeeds in putting you at the Ambassador on that fateful night and that alone would be enough to make me read this book."
1,USELESS,Should have spent my money on lottery tickets they will get you to the same place....money gone. I have 14 power woodworking tools small and large this will not adapt to any of them. Maybe would work for a flower pot.
5,An Investment!,"As an art major, I go through a lot of clay. In fact, all of my projects are made from Sculpey Clay. Normally, I buy the 1lb boxes in town (usually from Walmart as Michaels wants *way* too much), but I figured I needed more than that. When I went online shopping here on Amazon to replenish my supply at home, I stumbled onto this, and grabbed a box. I love it! Came brand new, and I have had no issues using it this school quarter. The price was good too, I thought, as I only paid about $45: if I buy a 1lb box its usually $20, so I actually got more for my money. I recommend this product and seller!"
3,white??,"the description says WHITE for the color of this product. It is what i was looking for. when i got it, it was not white. it is a flesh color. I got this product to make clay paws for people's pets and it would have been much nicer if it were white. i am dissapointed."
1,Very disappointed,I received this clay and it came dry. I had a hard time getting it workable. I had bought the clay to teach a Girl Scout troop about pinch pots. We added water to it to try to reconstitute it. Very unhappy.
3,Not for beginners in Tcl/Tk,"Too bad that none of the previous reviewers mentioned that this book is not for beginners. I happened to find this out reading the preface where the author refers you to other books if you arent already familiar with Tcl! What a farce, just wasted $40some bucks on this book.Once I learn Tcl/Tk from some 'other' book, perhaps I'll revisit this book and write another review."
2,"Too Much Cake, Very Little Fruit & Nuts!","Our family loves fruitcake and it's our Christmas tradition. We like to vary who we buy from because they're all very good, just different on the fruit to nuts ratio. This year we bought Grandma's from Figis (we found it on Figis internet site). I made sure it was the same cake as sold on Amazon before I wrote this review.The main problem is that we got more cake than fruit and nuts. It was also somewhat dry, probably because of the lack of moist fruit. The cake tastes quite good, but definitely not worth $30 for a good-tasting cake with a little bit of fruit and nuts. Seeing all the other glowing reviews, we probably got a batch that wasn't thrown out by quality assurance. What a disappointment! The photos look great, but they don't match what we received."
5,couldn't have Christmas without it!!,"Grandma's Fruitcake is at the top of my grocery shopping list every year for the holidays. If ever it didn't arrive before our scheduled dinner, we'd just have to postpone dinner!! I received my first as a gift in November, 1976, and have faithfully ordered at least one a year since. Thank you for a quality product chuck full of fruit, nuts and a delicious liquor based cake that is unparalleled in flavor. We already ate the one we got for Christmas this year...might just have to order a second one!! Thank you. Rarely does excellence span 5 decades unimpaired!"
2,Fruit Cake,Didn't like the flavor of the cake. not very tasty for a fruit cake. needed more rum and bourbon in it
1,No bake fruit cake??,"After reading the accolades and seeing all the stars rating this particular product, I purchased two. I haven't had a good fruitcake in many years, so I surmised that I couldn't go wrong in ordering two. Bad decision. Granted the cake was overflowing with nuts and fruit, but what little ""cake"" part there was had the consistancy of unbaked cake dough. Awful, just awful. Think I'll stick with pies for the holidays. Sorry Grandma!!"
3,Grandmas fruitcake,"I love fruitcake! But this one is not the best one that I have tried. It has lots of nuts, but not a lot of fruit. I would not get this again."
1,Junk; useless; poor support; dont buy,Tried installing it on two different computers with xp professional and a Swan wireless camera system. The installation software documentation is poor. Could never get it to work. Tech support was clueless and told me it may be incompatability with swan camera setup. Im not convinced. I think it is a dated product with software that has not been updated in 4 years. Im going to take it back. The tech told me to Buy the Clover system from sams club!
1,Obsolete,"Bought at Fry's. Software actually not included. Drivers are nowhere to be found on the ""wisecomm"" website. Not compatible with Vista."
5,GREAT external storage solution,"This driver is excellent! Definitely a plug and play solution, didn't/doesn't/hasn't crashed windows and when my system shut down due to power failure, the driver picked up where it left of with my transfer, not losing any data. I would purcase another and would also recommend it to friends and colleagues."
4,Good Product,I had no problems. I was attracted to the great deal this prodct offered and thought I might have to sacrifice something in the process but I really didn't. It works great!
2,Sloooooooow. Very Slooooooow,"I was thrilled when I received this item and started using it immediately. It seems nice and reliable (I think), BUT it is so slow it's not funny. This is the first time in my life that I give a review and I am even late for work but I got to say it. This thing is just sloooow. It takes forever to transfer data. I have to transfer 8g at it will probably take 9 hours. Now I leave it overnight and hope that is finished in the morning. Maybe it is this item only. I know my PC is fine. Just be careful."
5,Great Value and It Easily Converts to NTFS Format,"What a great deal, $69.00 when I bought it.It comes set-up for FAT32. Hop on over to Seagate's Knowledge Base, Type in Format after you fill in the basic info and it sends you to an article that tells you how to set-up the drive for NTFS. A minute or so later and you are done, all without reformatting.Here is the info to save you looking. Goto RUN, type in ""convert drive_letter: /fs:ntfs"". No quotes. All done.So this model is not the latest case design, it sits behind my laptop, so I cannot see it anyway.All my RAW files and .jpgs are moved over and I am flush with drive space."
3,Very Fluffly,"Very soft and puffy. Purchased as extra pillows for our bed. I'm going to get some organic cotton pillows to rest our heads on, but these pillows look great under pillow shams cause they are so thick."
5,Open & Utility Heads to Tails,"Absolutely the Best book on proofing for all exercises in these two classes. Methodical and logical with its basis in the basic drives that are found in all dogs, but to differing extents. Interesting and It works!"
1,Poor quality casting,The unit I recieved contained a very poor looking casting that still had metal shavings in it. I returned the unit and will be purchasing another brand.
2,Go see them live instead!,Seaweed's earlier albums reflect much more accurately the energy of their live shows. This album could be used as elevator music at Nordstrom's. Seaweed seems to have lost its punk heritage.
2,Applications of Case Study Second Edition,"I am a clinical psych. grad. trying to finish a case study dissertation. Also, an adult dignosed with ADHD and was looking for more help and structure. This book was somewhat helpful, but would have been more helpful for proposal than actual dissertation. Was looking for more help on dissertation structure. Wish I would have had this before I struggled with a proposal. But not so much help for dissertation."
2,Magnifier,I was disappointed in the product because I need a magnifier to read printed material. This one is too small and the magnification is not sufficient.
2,When it works - it's not bad...,"I use a spotlight on my ranch mainly during calving season, where you have to drive around in the fields checking the cows at all hours of the night.I have used these spotlights and you can get a decent amount of light out of them, but the trigger button has failed on all three of them that I have owned. After using this light for 3-4 months, the trigger would stop working. Granted, a spot light on my ranch gets somewhat abused in how I use them, they are hanging out the window of a truck in -10 weather, but that should not affect the trigger.3 million candle power is getting to be ""small"" these days. There are many other products out there well above 3 million.I have switched to this spotlight:Black and Decker 20 Million Power Series 3335 Lumens Spotlight #VEC192- they seem to have fixed the switch problem (it's a Vector light rebranded) - at least it has not failed on me after more usage than the Vector light listed here."
3,Quality control is out the window here!,"I bought this one to replace a single lamp with limited run time. Out of the package the shoulder strap was sewed backwards, plastic chips fell out of the AC charge adapter plug. Once you pop the cork style plug on the DC charge port, it will never go back in again. As for the run time listed. I barely get twenty minutes on one bulb illuminated, let alone two. Forty minutes of run time is simply wishful thinking. Since I use it for chasing rattlers out of the field, you get puckered in a real big hurry while heading for the barn to beat the light going dead. Maybe I just got a bright lemon???? The upside and because I am ordering a second unit is that this light throws a huge volume of light, in which, nothing but a blind person could miss anything in it's path. Outstanding! Now if they would just concentrate on the picky items like good batteries and plastics, this would be an awesome product or gift for anyone.D. ReidsemaCalifornia"
2,Mega Disappointment,"This item was advertised as shipping within 1-2 days. In fact, 11 days passed before it was shipped. It took a total of 14 days to arrive from the time I placed my order. Amazon's poor customer service was matched by the mediocre quality of this item. It's bright, but poorly made and so heavy it is awkward to use. I advise avoiding Amazon.com and this item."
3,Not impressed,"As I understand it this CD is a copy of a website, and has two purposes. Firstly to offer better pictures (higher resolution, no download time) than is possible over the internet. Secondly to raise some money towards the upkeep of the site.In view of these goals the quality of the pictures leaves a lot to be desired. Not all pictures are in color, and of those that are most are of a so-so quality. There are very few really good pictures, certainly not enough to justify buying the CD.For those who support the second aim or for those who want to have a reference that will run on a computer not connected to the internet this may be a good buy. Personally I would rather have a good book"
5,polish remover,"This is so much better and easier than polish remover and a cotton ball. Someone had a great idea ""inventing"" this!"
1,not for bmw,"it shows that fits bmw 318i wen it doesn't, I end up espending twice t money and a whole morning because its the wrong part"
5,Wonderful country music from Lonestar,"wonderful songs were sung by the singer Richie McDonald with all of his heart: Amazed, I'm already there and Not a day goes by. This CD of Lonestar is excellent. My best compliments to this group!"
3,Lonestar CD,"The case was cracked but CD works great also was shiped and received very quickly, very happy with product. Thanks"
3,"Sorry,but it's sappy","I mean, I've tried, but these guys always sound like they need a shot of testosterone....I know they're so up & coming, but I wish they'd just go. It's like NSync met the Osmonds, then they decided to ""call"" it ""country"" . Well, it isn't.And will someone take that ""sippy cup a meeelk"" out of that kids hand ??!!"
1,Beware this is not the REAL Lone Star,"The real Lone Star were a hard rock/prog-leaning band from Wales in the 1970s, who released two astounding albums, but were eclipsed by the arrival of punk in 1977. Guitarist Paul ""Tonka"" Chapman went on to be iN UFO. With incredible musicianship and stunning production by Roy Thomas Baker (Queen's then producer) and Gary Lyons (RTBs assistant) Lone Star were destined for great things. It is disingenuous when modern day acts re-use names (or use very similar names as is the case here) from the past. The recent Nirvana was not the first, and this is more of the same."
1,A lone star for Lonestar,"Looking at the track list for this album, I was surprised to find ""No News,"" a song I liked enough when it came out to pick up the single, but which I had forgotten was Lonestar. A forgivable lapse, since they have since become the Kings of Country Schmaltz (and if I never hear ""Amazed"" again it will be too soon). What is not forgivable, however, is the band's destruction of Marc Cohn's ""Walking In Memphis."" Pick up Cohn's self titled album instead, and you'll not only have a vastly superior version of that song, but a vastly superior album in every respect. With regards to this album, we shall have to hope that Lonestar figures out how to bore a hole in their music and let some of the sap out before they get around to releasing Greatest Hits Volume II."
5,A great Greatest Hits album.,"This is one of the best Greatest Hits albums ever!!!! I have listened to Lonestar since they first debeut in 1995 With ""Tequia Talkin'"" which is on this album all the way up to their current hit ""From My Front Porch Lookin' in"" On this album, You find the Number 1 Hits, ""No News"" Their very first number 1, ""Come Cryin' To Me"", ""Amazed"" which spent 8 weeks at Number 1 on the country chart and became the Number 1 country hit for all of 1999, ""Smile"", ""What About Now"", and ""I'm Already There"". So buy this album today. It is a great one for all Lonestar fans."
1,Price Gouging,"I have been in telecommunications for over ten years now and I can honestly say that no one in their right mind would pay this price for this product. you can find these type of ""snips"" at any Home Depot or Lowes for under fifteen bucks be sure to check you price before you buy this item."
4,Excellent overview with some good meat in it,"The author does an excellent job at covering a lot of ground, and balances high-level description with technical detail. It gives a good lay of the land in this topic, discusses the problems, details the protocols, and overall gives you a good footing when it's time to go read the ITU specs and RFC's.Highly recommended."
5,Amazing!,"Had this mic for about 5 years now and it still works like new. I was unsure of the quality due to the low price tag, but it's surpassed my expectations by far! I use this for guitar, vocals, piano and the occasional snapping of my fingers...It truly is a universal mic. I don't have a lot to compare to in my mic collection, but every time I go to venture out into the mic world, I always have someone telling me to just stay put because of the quality my mic brings. See if you can get a local store to let you purchase it and try it out for a week or so. It's hard to buy a mic without testing it out, but this hasn't let me down yet! Been recording for 10+ years and this has been a great addition to my collection.Hope this helps!"
1,Can I borrow your charger?,"Bought this item for my wife for yardwork-tree branches and the like. Then the charger took a dump-Can't figure out why. It was a clearance item at Amazon.com partner Target. But guess what? Black and Decker changed batteries/chargers and you can't buy the older ones anywhere! You can drop $60+ dollars on a DeWalt charger, or scrap the whole kit and kaboodle. So we now own a 10 pound paperweight. Yipee."
5,Hitch Receiver,"This hitch did like it was avertised, went on with no drilling and was installedin about 45 min to 1 hour by myself. Very professional made hitch."
1,Fodor's German For Traveloers (Phrase Book) 3rd Edition,CDs were included with the 2nd edition. Why are they missing from the 3rd edition? They are a vital part of learning the phrases!
2,Not satisfactory,I was not satisfied academically. It is like a PhD thesis with a strange theoretical argument. I was disappointed.
4,"A difficult read, but worth the time.","Though Bluegrass Breakdown is, as a previous reviewer contends, overly academic (sometimes to the point of boredom), it does provide a scholarly and highly respected exploration into the genre. More a textbook than something you'd read for fun, Bluegrass Breakdown is a must for anyone who wants to get to the roots of this uniquely American form"
1,Pretentious and annoying.,"Cantwell's volume represents everything I hate in a book about music. Pompous and pretentious pseudo-revelatory academic blather about folk music. Compare and contrast Cantwell's account with the genuinely readable and insightful history by Neil Rosenberg. As I recall there's a blurb on the cover comparing this work with Greil Marcus' brilliant Mystery Train....well, hardly, not even in the same league. Here's a rule of thumb for books on various genre's of music, as you read the volume do you seek out the recordings or performances discussed by the author? Nothing in Bluegrass Breakdown moved me to explore artists or styles. This is a book by one of those academics who is more intereted in showing the reader just how much he's learned about this quaint folk music. In a word...annoying."
5,Native Eyewear Silencers,"These sunglasses are awesome. Very light and surprisingly sturdy. I've had a set for over two years now and I love them. They take an incredible pounding. The best part is the lifetime warranty on the frames. I took a hit to the head playing Ultimate Frisbee that snapped the earpiece on my first set. I filled out the warranty form and viola! I had a new set of frames within about 2 weeks of sending my broken set in (just remember...warranty is for FRAMES...take your lenses out before sending them back). I also do target shooting...pop in the yellow frames for indoor low light settings and you've got a great set of shooting ""eyes"". Love this product...better than any other set of glasses I've owned. You will not be disappointed (in fact...you may buy another set in a different style)."
1,Just an overview,"Professor Selzer's work does provide an overview, but does not supply a sufficent historical context, nor any particularly provocative insights."
4,cute but breakable,My son loves them and they match the theme perfectly but they've fallen out a few times and one broke.great quality!!!
1,Extremely overpriced chunk of Plastic,"The description does not give the length, and you would think that for $24 list that you are going to get 4-6 feet of bumper. Not so, you get 24 inches. Of course, you also get ""all the hardware to install""--this is three screws not even long enough to go through wallboard to a stud and 3 small plastic anchors. It also does not look like the picture--it is a flat piece of plastic about 24""x4"" with an attaching flange. I really didn't expect this to be much, but I was still very disappointed. Should sell for $1.99."
2,Overpriced piece of plastic,"This Wall Guard is just two feet in length, not allowing much room for error in placement. Plus, it will only work for one particular vehicle being parked in nearly the exact same position each time. They could have made it a bit bigger, for the price."
5,Happy Camper/Hiker,"This is another neat tool to have on a camping trip. This saw is capable of cutting through trees about the circumference of an average persons lower leg, though I have been able to cut through sizes of approximately the circumference of an average persons thigh. Comes with a neat carrying case, though it is made out of plastic, and does easily connect to your belt. Be very careful of the teeth, they are very sharp."
3,"Profound work, sadly packaging is brittle","The books are well worth the investment, sadly the plastic with which they are encased in is brittle and prone to cracking. I received my copy in the mail today and it was already damaged due to shipping. I see it falling apart in the near future. Some of the fragments have scratched the book encased with in. Needless to say i am not happy. Maybe some foresight into the packaging design would have been nice by Rizzoli publishing. Would have given it 5 stars had the packaging been designed to be a little more durable. I understand that i am not the only one who has experienced this.aLEKs"
4,Classic Fusion,"Bought this double LP in 1981 after hearing Tocatta, which sounds like a modern rock instrumental, even though it was written by JS Bach a few hundred years ago! Tracks 1-7 are fabulous but my personal favorite is Scipio Parts 1 & 2. One sour note: on the Cd Scipio fades about one minute earlier than it does on the vinyl version. Guess they had to shave something to get it all on one CD. Overall a great example of how jazz,rock,classical and pop can be combined to make great songs. Intelligent and fun!"
5,More Great Music from SKY,"See my review of SKY V1; this is also a replacement for my 15 year old albums. I like the classical themes and enjoy the ""Tuba Smarties"" as it reminds me of my college days when 3 of our tuba players presented ""Holiday for Trumpets"" on tubas. If you like classical music and soft jazz, you will probably love this music."
3,Willow Wisp are awesome!!,"This Tribute CD to one of my favorite bands in the world Cradle Of Filth also includes a great cover of ""The Forest Whispers My Name"" by Incredible Hollywood,Ca.Goth Black Metal group Willow Wisp.Other noteworthy covers are performed by Kaul,Mirzadeh and Serpents Aria.Buy this for the novelty factor and the killer version of ""The Forerst Whispers My Name"" by Willow Wisp!!"
4,not bad,"preety c00l tracks,like noctuary kaul , wehrwolfes are the bestones.some otheres are [not good] but i would say well woerth the cash for above bands"
4,preety g00d,"not bad i must say,some partecluar tracks are weak,but also veryexcellant dark musick covers from nocturary , kaul ,wehrwolfes....well worth the ca$h for this effort i must decree....."
2,Hate tribute albums...,"with bands that try their best to sound like the original. Guys and gals...c'mon...put your own stamp on these songs...be original don't try and sound like Dani Filth...cause you can't...case closed. If you want Cradle of Filth...buy Cradle of Filth not this crude attempt at a tribute to in my honest opinion one of the best bands around. Yeah, I can get into some of the songs on here and there are some bright spots (Hence 2 stars and not 1) but if your looking for some diamonds in the rough and some originality look elsewhere."
2,bad!,"Aside from a few ridiculous vampire-wannabe bands and some irrelevantaspiring clones that have given black metal a bad name, Cradle of Filthis truly responsible for starting fashion trends, fake teeth, infantileimageries and,of course, a style of metal that you either love or hate.I believe their first 4 albums to be their decent best work, but theykind of lost me after that. It seemed like the more popular they got,the more they stagnated. A tribute album was inevitable. The good thingabout this cd is bands like Mirzadeh, Noctuary, Wehrwolfe, Born of thorns,Willow Wisp and especially Kekal, who did their respective covers andnot only sounded almost as good as the original, but they added somethingslightly different to make things absorbing. The bad, well, pretty muchthe rest of the compilation. Some of those vocalists were trying to hardto sound like Danni, but failed miserably, while the other bands wereeither badly covering an already mediocre song or butchering a good one.Buy at own risk!"
1,Just to let you know,"Ok, I wouldn't listen to the reviewer saffronscurse69. Listening since their demos in 97 eh? Sorry to burst your bubble, but Cradle's first full length album was out in 1994. Demos were out in 92 and 93. So, to everyone else, do you want to trust a review by someone who doesn't know what he's talking about? And on top of that, why bother with a cover album? The originals are works of art, don't settle for tacky art-deco when you can have a masterpiece."
4,Not TOO bad,I recently bought two of these. One of them was fine and the other seems to be a bit over filled :/. Me and my buddy hack during break at work and turns out he likes the I Kic better than his cheap $3 one :P. Not a bad buy but will need to be worked in.
4,Nice mellow jams!,"Definetly feeling this one! Unique in every sense of the word, a must have for those nights alone with your special someone!"
2,Feels cheap.,"I ordered a couple stainless spatulas, and I'm glad this wasn't the only one I bought. It is small, feels a little cheap, and the handle is uncomfortable. My least-favorite spatula and will probably get donated soon."
1,What were they thinking?,"This spatula is heavy and well made. BUT, it is dangerously small. The handle is very short which brings your hand uncomfortably close to the item you are cooking. You take a risk of getting hurt by splattering grease or other liquid or coming in contact with the edge of a hot pan. Because the handle is so short the handle can get hot if used too long. The head of the spatula is very small and is impractical unless you are cooking sliders! The only practical use I can see for this item is to give it to your child for a sandbox toy. Have no idea why anyone would make a spatula so small. What were they thinking?"
5,A must-have for the guerrilla film maker,"If you've just bought your first 16mm camera or thinking of hiring one for a shoot, this book is invaluable. It's a fascinating subject and Douglas Underdahl manages to make it funny too!!! There's also plenty of advice for the first time director. What more can I say? The book makes you want to grab your Bolex, run into the street and start making a movie!!"
5,Spotting scope photography,"I wanted to start taking photos using my spotting scope and had difficulty with modifying my Canon camera,, this adaptor allowed me to make the necessary modifications necessary for a good fit to my scope, there is unfortunately little information, on taking these photos with a spotting scope with a 2"" lens, this adaptor has made the attachment of my camera possible for excellent photos with a 20x - 60x scope when combined with a camera supporting frame."
2,Works okay,"This ring has 52mm threads on one side, and threads for a telescope's T-mount on the other side. The threads are a little course, and I worried about shavings collecting in the bottom of my newtonian telescope, but I made sure to brush them off a few times. I still need a spacer before I am able to use the zoom on my camera, but this adapter certainly works for my needs. It is a bit expensive for such a crudely made adapter ring."
4,Great stool,"I love this stool. It rolls nicely, is a good height for my purposes (giving neck massages and CranioSacral Therapy to patients who are laying on a massage table) and it hasn't threatened to break. It was easy to assemble, once enough pressure was applied it all just clicked together and has stayed together. The reason I gave it 4 stars is that the seat is so slippery that I slide off of it during sessions. I wish the seat came in a matt finish."
4,"Comfortable, rolling stool","This is easy to assemble, comfortable little task stool. Slides under the desk when not in use, terrific styling -- just think it is great."
2,"stool is fine, but missing parts!","stool is fine, but missing parts! i ordered 2 of these, one was fine, the other was missing most of the parts that attach the 2 sections together. so frustrating!!!!!!"
3,"its a stool, a little pricey","bought for gf as she needed a stool for her vanity. for this purpose it works great. The only problem is that it has plastic wheelsthat have no grip. so if you have hardwood floor, the wheels are likely to slide instead of turn. no big deal as the room its being used in has carpet."
5,Pretty great,"Sturdy, easy to assemble, sleek pseudo industrial look, right price. I use mine as a replacement at the bathroom vanity."
4,Slippery Seat,"Overall, I am happy with this seat. It is very comfortable and the castors work well. My only complaint is that the seat is very slippery. very very slippery. But its still wicked cool. I will definately buy more of these stools."
4,Great deal! Just one thing...,"Great price, easy to put together, good quality. Only complaint would be the color not matching the image online. I chose the pink and it is more fuchsia. I love it, its even prettier than the color I had originally selected. However, if you are relying on the images online to match a specific color you may be disappointed."
4,Solid product - good value,"No frills. Chair built with decent materials. Not high quality, but solid. Overall, the chair surpassed my expectations based on the price."
1,Got a lemon and had to pay through the nose to return it,"This arrived in a damaged box that had obviously been opened and resealed. Upon inspection, the stool appeared to be OK. However, when it was assembled it didn't work. The height adjustment went up but not back down. I couldn't get it apart to put back in the original box. It cost me almost $26 to have packed into a new box so I could return in. I was told by Amazon that the boxing cost would be refunded. I'm still waiting for that. To top it all off, the ""YELLOW-GG Vibrant Orange-Yellow"" was no where near the ""yellow"" that shows on the screen. It was an ugly orange. I am not happy with this experience."
4,good chair,"This chair is good for my office. I just wish it adjusted a little lower than it does. Overall, works good."
1,Did not come in silver as expected,Received this item in gold print. Wasted my money. Never gave me an option for silver or gold. Saw the picture in silver and thought that would be what I would receive.
5,Photo Album,"I ordered this product a few years ago for my friend's wedding. I got married last year. I had a friend photograph my wedding, so I was researching photo albums to store my wedding photos. I wanted something easy to handle, not to large, but able to hold a lot of photos. The only problem is that I ordered two albums. They couldn't guarantee that I would received the albums with ""Wedding"" in silver . They come in silver, gold, or Blank.... In the end, I received the two albums in silver. I love the product."
2,Picture is Deceiving,There are 4 choices of albums but the customer does not get to choose. I sent 2 e-mails(unaswered) in an attempt to get the company before the items were shipped so I could ensure the style that I wanted. I called and got a recording that said they were overloaded with calls to call back later or e-mail them...yeah good one! I called the next day to see how one would go about getting the pictured album instead of playing roulette but was told it's just whatver they want to ship. Can't take requests. Sounds like a plan to me! This is a very nice book if you can get the one you want. Other sites let you choose but cost more.
3,get the correct power,Dont get the same power as you would if you were buying reading glasses. The strenght for reading glasses should be stronger than the shop glasses. This is because you hold your material closer if you are reading than if you are working out in the shop. Think about it most of the time when you are out in the shop you are working at distances of 20-36 inches and when reading your working distance is about 16 inches. Take my advise I am an optometrist.
4,At first I fell in love with these,"When I saw the ad with a bifocal, I thought that would solve all of the problems, and it does. I was continually popping reading glasses on and off when I had to make a setting, and then putting on regular protective eyewear for everything else, what a nuisance. These bifocals allow you to enjoy the protection while looking through clear glass. When you need to see something with some correction, the bottom of the lense has a 1.5 magnification.I gave it four stars because the plastic lense is not secured very well to the frame. It is a snap in hold, and it frequently snaps out. Then I have to reassemble the glasses. I am tempted to get out the epoxy and make the assembly permanent. If I had to do it all over again, I would still buy these. The convenience of a bifocal outweighs the epoxy correctable assembly problem. So overall I highly recommend them."
4,Good price clinched it!,I bought these 3 months ago and so far they are maintaining their overall shape and softness. I realise that many pillows dont have a long life before they are flat but so far these are doing well. The price dropped down to $10 for the pair which was very reasonable. If they are that cheap again i will purchase more for future use.
3,NFL-NO Saint's Watch,"I purchased this item as a gift, and I was disappointed that the patent-leather band is so shiny. Beware, the watch is very large for a woman, It almost looks like a man's watch. But, the person I gave it to, loved it and that's all that matters! P.S. When I first ordered this it was stated that the band was leather, then it was later after my order, it was posted as patent-leather and much lower in price. I never got an explaination for this..."
2,"Band is cheap, face is too big","The band on this watch is very cheap looking and came a bit scratched. The face is too big for a women in my opinion, its the size of a mans watch."
5,Much prettier than the picture.,I bought two of these. One for me and one for my BF. They are really beautiful and gives us something girly to wear to the games.
3,Somewhat Sad and a Little Disappointed,"I loved this product when I saw it. However, the picture clearly shows a white watchband. I just got the watch and it is silver. I am so disappointed in the color of the watchband. I am now taking the watch and getting a white band put on it because this is a Thanksgiving gift and it is a bit too late to order something else. Game Time Glitz-NFL you need to update the picture for the Miami dolphins watch or list the color of the band clearly in the description."
1,Sigh,"I could not fall asleep. Read a little bit of Peelsticker or licker whatever, and was off to sleepy land. Not sure about the book, but his profile will put anyone to sleep. Thanks again zzzzzzz"
1,Foreplay is about it,"What can one say of a surrealist anthology that is more boring than illuminating, and more turgid than exhilerating? What can one say of a surrealist group that allows the publication of an anthology that, in presenting an astonishing range of subjects, also reveals an imponderable superficiality in doing so, save in several brilliant texts sometimes written by creators who have only marginal affiliations with that group, have broken completely with them, or who are no longer surrealist? Rhetorical enthusiasms and historical justifications aside -- although they are difficult to place aside in this book as they appear again and again, ad nauseum -- a reader will have to search to find keys that inspire.So good luck, reader; but remember this: the weight of this volume may prevent you from carrying it with you when awake or asleep."
3,A bit of a bore,I bought this book because I'm a fan of Jane Dyer's illustrations but the text content just does not thrill me. Looks are what this book has going for it.
5,Cuts Through The Fog!!!. A Very Rare Book!!!,"This book was written by a true friend of humanity.His love of God is perfectly reflected in his desire to guide us away from the fires of Hell.It was a very real wake up call for me when I realized the seriousness of my careless actions in the sight of God.The seriousness of sin is the theme here.The world tends to treat what God sees as sin, as opportunities for pleasure, and the freedom of self-expression.The author does not flatter the reader. He loves us too much for that. He seeks to make us deciples of Christ, not of himself. It is extremely rare to find an author so generous.No matter if you're chained to porn, adultery, non-marital sex, or the false doctrines of protestantism, this book will shine a light on your chains and give you the perfect weapon to break them.The author makes you aware of the sins you commit on a daily basis and why so much evil follows you like a shadow throughout your life."
5,FANTASTIC,This book is for all generations and for any century. I read it twice and I am reading it again. My copy is worn so I am getting another. Listen if this book does not bring you back I dont know what will. This is old school teaching filled with Scripture verses from the Douay Rheims version; which is the only version you should read as it is without error. I highly recommend you read this book slowly and implement it in your life and SAINTHOOD IS YOURS. READ IT OR RUE IT.
5,This album Rocks,"When I'm down, when I am feeling seperated from the Lord, this music helps to bring me back. I've only recently rediscovered CCM and Selah, So this is all still fresh to me. Keep pressing On!"
2,Laserjet 1018 - no networking capability,"This is strictly a personal printer which can not be networked using any print server, including H-P's own print servers. H-P will sell you a $99 Wireless Printer Adapter Kit if you will need to share this printer in a home network (wireless or wired)."
3,you didn't make a mistake,"If you wanted an inexpensive laser printer with very little hassle and really quite decent performance, you chose wisely. If you're going to nitpick over something you purchased for so little, in my opinion you're looking a gift horse in the mouth. It's very much not the sort of laser one would use to draft a novel or produce a company-wide memo. This is absolutely as advertised - an easy to use personal laser printer that will perform very well for the money. Don't put it in your office and don't use it for heavy production. When used for short runs that quietly thank your wallet, this is a real gem."
1,It Broke after Two Weeks - Lousy Phone Support,"""Frank"" from customer support kept me on the phone for 45 minutes while he wrote up a ""ticket"" to replace this printer for me after it developed a phantom paper jam. Apparently, my role as the customer is to wait while Frank takes one hour of my time having me plug the computer in and out of the wall and then waiting while he writes up a ""ticket"" and puts me on hold. ""Frank"" tells me that I will get a new computer and then puts me on hold for ten minutes. HP chat online refused to help and told me that On Hold Frank was the only option!!! ""Frank"", please, this printer is not worth one hour of my time on hold. I threw this machine into the garbage and ordered a new laser printer from another company.Not recommended for hardware or support."
3,bad software,"the HP Laser jet printer itself is actually a good product, it was the software disc that came with it that was the problem, it had a trojan horse virus!"
4,HP Laserjet 1018,Meets all my specifications. It was very reasonable priced. Easy setup. Good printouts. Has economode and manual double side printing capabilities. Changing paper for second side printing was easy with instructions prompting me what to do.
4,Not For Macs,"While I am sure this is a great printer for the price, it will not work with Macs, despite what an employee at a large computer chain told me. There are no Mac drivers for the 1018 and none of the work arounds listed on the net seem to work. I had to return this printer to Amazon and ordered the HP 1022 that is Mac compatible."
5,Winner!,Great printer for the money. It is fast and has a small footprint. We used our previous HP Laserjet for 11 years before giving it to a relative who still uses it.
2,Vista Driver is a Nightmare,Took me days to fix. You have to install driver first BEFORE plugging printer to USB. Blame is on Vista (Premium Home) though.
3,No Vista 64 support,"There is a 32 bit version of Vista driver, but no 64 bit version. Buyer beware. HP has fallen off the horse and broke a hip on Vista Support. There are to many HP products not supported by Vista, If you have Vista, I suggest buying someone elses product for the time being until they figure it out."
2,Fair printer but serious instalation problem,"Similar problem to what Dr. Leslie describes. I replaced a Samsung USB laser printer with this one. The Samsung was working flawlessly with my system but the drum got some scratches. After installing the Laserjet 1018 I could not see the card reader or any memory stick I plugged into any USB port or syncronize my PDA. Installed the latest driver from their website, same problem. Uninstalled the printer, rebooted, and everything was back to normal. Contacted support, they tried to help but there is no workaround. They suggested buying an USB hub ""because our printer takes more USB power compared to Samsung"". HA!! They have to upgrade the driver and warn about this problem on their website or they are losing credibility.Otherwise the printer works well, the text is average and there is no banding on images. But it's going back."
2,The 1018 is a throwaway printer,"I've had the LaserJet 1018 for about 6 months. It's cheap small and looks nice on the desk. About a month ago the printer stopped pulling paper correctly and that's when all hell broke loose. I should have simply thrown the printer out. Instead, I did like most would do....I tried to work through HP support to get the problem corrected. Don't bother. Just throw it away."
4,I am very happy with it.,"I have been satisfied with this printer. I have only had one trouble with it pulling more than one sheet of paper through at a time, but that is all the trouble that I have had. I recommend this item highly. I bought it for use in college, printing powerpoints."
1,weight loser,"I tried this product, took as prescribed, and did not lose any weight. Sorry. Even though I did not weigh myself on a scale, I know if my body has lost any weight or not, it did not."
5,"Fun, creative approach","This book is part how-to guide and part novel, but all fun. Learn to bring out a more sensual you and then follow three very different, but likable heroines as they do the same. I liked the idea and the execution."
2,Not happy,Like the others I find that this doesn't stay still. Every time we park the car it slides forward. I tried duct taping it to the floor of the garage - that helps but it still needs to be adjusted every few days.
1,Junk. Won't stay in place.,"I ordered two of these from Amazon.com and then waited more than three weeks before they arrived. Within a day, I noticed that they would not stay in place on the garage floor. Whenever you park using them, they move.These are junk. Don't buy them."
2,It move around,"It moves forward whenever I go over it, and after a few weeks you are hitting the wall again. Bought a simillar product, ParkingTarget, and it has a sticky tape underneath so it doesn't move around. Check it out for yourself, I am glad I found out... I just wish someone told me before I bought this expensive piece of plastic. I bought mine from ParkingTarget.com."
3,Great when used correctly...,"If you're like me, I hate having a ball hanging from the ceiling. That is why I like this product so much. It's fairly easy getting it in the right place. The trick is not to enter too fast or you will never feel when your tire is in the right spot. Also, since it is not much wider than the tire you have to drive in relatively the same each time. I'm actually considering buying 3 more since my tires are leaving black spots on my garage floor."
3,Easy to Use but...,"I just bought the parking guide one month ago. It's very easy to use, you just basically put it on the location where you want the car to stop, however... the bottom of the parking guide has no traction what-so-ever, so if your garage floor is smooth, chances are when ur car drives over the guide, it will cause the guide to move forward too...:( I had to buy one of those traction pad for shoes to stick on the bottom of the parking guide to prevent it from moving :)"
2,Carpet Tape Required,"Like other reviewers, I have discovered that this thing does not stand still. It should have had built in rubber feet. I had to carpet tape it to the garage floor. It works fine now.It also works best with manual cars because automatic cars will tend to want to continue driving over it. I have to put the minivan into neutral and let go of the brake for a split second to allow the wheels to adjust itself."
1,A Very Poor Product,"This is a very poor version of this type product. I purchased two online after my local home improvement stores stopped carrying a different version. The ones in the store were heavy, this one is light as a feather, which is why it will not stay in place. I have tried heavy duty two sided tape, heavy duty glue, and duct tape, and nothing will work."
2,slides on concrete,this parking guide slides on my garage floor. i glued some old rubber innertubes on the bottom of it at it seems to help. it still gradually slides over time though.
3,It's not exactly as advertised,I purchased this parking stop to match the one I already have but when it arrived it was different & is not exactly like the one in the photo. It still works ok but has slightly smaller bumps. I wanted matching stops.
4,basic but rather effective,"we've had this product probably for 24 months now. it's as basic as it gets & works well. i'm not sure why the other folks seem to have problems with the product moving. i find if you pull in straight, it works perfectly. the only time it might move, and this has been quite rare in my experience, is when you pull in & as you drive on to the parking guide/mat, you turn the wheel----------the end result here is that the mat does move (duh....). by & large, this product is ingenious in its simplicity & effective in daily usage. it sure beats those who nail or screw 2x4s into their garage floor. we routinely move ours to sweep or vacuum the garage floor."
2,Second Thoughts,"I regret buying this thing. Unless you drive into your garage very precisely, you're going to miss it, because it's far too narrow. Maybe if you buy three or four and tape them side by side, they will work more reliably, but it would be cheaper to use an alternative that is not as sensitive to your car's left and right position.This works best if you have a very narrow space in your garage and always end up in the same spot, but otherwise forget it."
2,not a great brush,"too few teeth or tongs or bristles, why are cat brushes always pink?, my cat does not like it very much."
4,Excellent book overall but...,"It is an excellent book overall with a great wealth of information but one thing really upset me: The fact that they do not describe or even nominate most of the subspecies. For example: It describes E. chlorotica and says that it has five subspecies but do not describe any and do not give any of the subspecies names! Only because of these omissions, this book does not earn a 5 star rating. Recommended!"
3,"Hello, My Name Is Scrambled Eggs","This story was about a family from Vietnam and Harvey Trumble&#65533;s family is trying to help them figure their way around America to see how they pay their bills. Harvey is trying to help the family&#65533;s son, Tuan Nguyen, Tuan is going to school with Harvey and he is trying to help him find his way through it. Harvey showed Tuan how to write letters speck English, and shows him how to eat at lunch. Until the end of the book, Tuan is now able to do all that things that Harvey can do. Therefore, whatever Harvey does or wherever he goes&#65533; Tuan is always behind him."
2,The two best friends,This story takes place in 1985 at Zito`s house. Quint was his best friend. He always ate breakfast over there. He always carried a marble with him and they go to school and when they come home he had to eat dinner over Zito`s house. So they go and have fun eating stuff.This story is mostly about two boys that always make jokes all the time about scrambled eggs. And is a story about food all they eat. Then Zito lost his marble and he said that Quint stole his marble but Quint did not take it. He told the teacher that Quint stole the marble that he liked so they started to yell at each other. Then school was out so they went home then Zito said he was very sorry. He said that he left the marble at his house so they became friends againIn my opinion this story was not that bad it was kind of boring but it was good not awesome but who cares about marbles and eggs.
4,A great value. 63 for under $30,"I was leery of purchasing this import because it had no description at the time. I feared poor sound quality. These recordings are licensed originals by Capitol to EMI. Excellent sound quality. The overall package design is nice, but it would have been nicer to have a booklet of liner notes to go with it. The 3rd CD has a brief timeline in outline form of some major events in Darin's life, but that's it. Overall it's a purchase you'll be happy with and is a better value for the money than the other Darin Box Set ""As Long As I'm Singin'"" . The set is also nice if you already own one of the single Cd ""greatest hits"" albums with Mack the Knife, Beyond the Sea etc etc because you won't find duplicates of these on this set. These are songs mainly from Darin's Sinatra-period and a little from his folk period."
5,A Must Have for Darin Fans,This is an excellent 3 disc set of Bobby Darin. Sound quality is very good and the price is right. Ole Blue Eyes had nothing over Mr Darin.
3,Whistlin' Dixie,I use this book and others similar to this one when doing transcripton and translation work. It is a very useful too.
4,"Great every day, light duty tool.","I have had this toolset for a while now and it is still the most used item in my tool chest. For all the little home improvement projects it works great. You can drill, saw and sand and there is room in the case for other tools.I recommend getting a quick-lock drill/driver set to take full advantage of the portability.I also recommend getting the 1 hour charger for the battery packs. The batteries are the only weak point of this tool. They wear out fast and the charger that comes with the set takes FOREVER to charge them up again. So if you are tackling a bigger project you might run out of power before you are done and then have to wait. Sucks bg time!"
4,Rewards Serious Listening,"Rubbra's symphonies are eminently listenable, but never bland. The Fourth is in three movements, with the third movement dividing into two distinct sections. The music in the opening movement just seems to flow along with a sense of inevitability, the second movement provides a peaceful respite, while the third movement concludes the work with weight and power, but never bombast. The Tenth is in four sections (but the last section is less than a minute long), while the Eleventh is written in one movement: in this recording, both works time out within one second of each other (14:58 and 14:57, respectively).These are not catchy works with melodies you are likely to go around humming for days, but if you are willing to sit down and listen seriously, you will find them quite rewarding. Sound quality is up to the usual Chandos standard, which is very good, indeed."
5,Hotel Costes Better Watch Out,"I have only listened to this CD once and I was compelled to write this review. I hope this review is seen by a lot of people. THIS IS A SINGULARLY OUTSTANDING COMPILATION. It's unclassifiable. If you collect the Hotel Costes series, I seriously think you should get this CD. You will not be disappointed. Each track is beautiful and elegant, just like the fashion house and cafe it was created for. BRAVO!!"
5,Ted,This book was a plesant suprise. It captures the feel of a good old fasioned scary story. A book that makes your imagination create the fear through the words of the author. 5-stars...
2,Issues with ink,The red ink in this pen did not work when it was given as a gift and the black ink soon quit working.
2,good intentions,"I was excited when I ordered this pen online--I thought that I could finally put away my separate pen and pencil. However, I was greatly disappointed when I actually sat down to write with it. I would compare the quality of the ink to that of a Bic ballpoint pen. The ink doesn't ""flow"" like a Pilot pen. Maybe the cartridge that came with the pen is a dud. I'm going to give the pen one more chance by ordering a refill cartridge and seeing if that works better. Who cares if it can write upside down and under water? I just want it to write decently on dry land."
2,Clogs appear when writing - quality not good,Clogs appear when writing - quality not goodWeight of the pen is not balanced along both sidesRubber grip is easy to catch dust particles and makes the pen look cheapI would not recommend this pen - go for a cross tech4
5,Best Pen!,"I love this pen! It feels great and writes so well. The only con which isn't a huge deal is that I have no need for the stylus option. This pen would be PERFECT if it came with black, red, blue and pencil option."
4,What a great pen!,"Excellent pen if you have a touchscreen PDA/Smartphone. Being a 'Space Pen', it writes in all positions without running dry. It's nicely 'thick' for those who like that, and its of high quality."
5,Convenient!,"Great for class to organize notes! This is all I need to take to class! I was surprised that this is the size of a normal pen! The only negative is that the red ran out really fast, but the black is still going! Writes beautifully."
3,"Tight Prose, Moderately Enjoyable Story, Poorly Drawn Characters","The book is a mixed bag. It's tightly written, with multiple narrators and points of view - first-person and third-person - that switch frequently between characters. There are moments when the story is completely engrossing, but others where I found it hard to really care...and together, I think that's the novel's true weakness: the tight prose, increasing pace and constant back and forth between flashbacks, multiple points of view, multiple settings and multiple characters is just too much for 217 pages.The story is enjoyable but ultimately, rather forgettable."
4,Great all around blade for basic shop cutting on Grizzly band saw,"this is the blade that I keep on my Grizzly stand alone metal band saw. it has done 2"" X 2"" square pipe all the way to 1"" solid Stainless round bar stock (when properly set for speed) and is still going strong after 50 or more cuts."
5,Wonderful Garden Book & Great Idea!,I love this book! This is an absolutely great book to share with children about gardening. It is also a really cute idea to do with your sunflowers at home. Great book for Spring and Summer for sure! It's a great way to show children about the life cycle of a sunflower. So cute!
3,My daughter thought it was boring...I think it is intended for younger kids,"My daughter is into gardening in a huge way and loves to read books. She started the Junior Master Gardener courses last year and this book was on their suggested reading list for kids. I think that perhaps it is meant for a much younger audience than my daughter. She is 8-years old and she could not get into it. About half way into it she proclaimed it boring and put it down in favor of another book. However, I give it 3 stars because I personally thought the book was cute. I was a little disappointed in the illustrations. I was hoping they would be more vibrant. I think that would have helped maintain interest. I would recommend this for no older than a 6-year old."
1,Zero Stars,"Spare yourself! I can't believe I even wasted the time, contemplating whether or not to rent this at Redbox. Wish I had just thrown $1 on the ground and forgotten about it. It makes me mad that that something like this even finds the celluloid! Maybe my clue should have been that I could not find it, even after checking many similar titles, on IMDB. Folks, I do recommend IMDB when in doubt. DO NOT EVEN think of buying this, let alone your time watching a rental. Amazon needs to drop it!"
5,I loved this book,"This is definately one of my favourite books of all time. I could not put it down. It was easy to read and I always wanted to turn the page to see what strange twist would happen next. The story is about three girls, Hannah, Vivian and Wren, and how they grew up in a small town with slightly dysfunctional families. This book is beautifully written and I would recommend it to anybody who loves reading!"
4,Amazing Women,"I had the honor to work with this amazing women later in her life. She is brilliant, insightful and quirky. The book is an interesting read. It is a shame that it is out of print. Her father is an author as well. He wrote ""The greatest story ever told"""
1,paper weight,This thing does not work as advertised. I also find it a bit funny that all the 5 star reviews for it are from people who rate all the same products from cavalry with 5 stars.One touch OS backup only gives you endless errors and doesn't backup anything.
1,Bad Software,"I bought this Hard Drive based on the One Touch OS Backup feature and the price. The Drive seems to work fine, but like another reviewer, I get a ""Allocated Memory Fail"" Error. There are newer versions of the software available on the tech support website for the software, but I get a ""bad block"" error when trying to install the newer version. I have emailed Tech support to try to resolve this problem and their only suggestion is that maybe I have a cluster size set too small on my Hard Drive. (my Hard Drive is NTFS with the default cluster size of 4k, this backup software seems to only work if the external hard drive is FAT 32 - this may be causing the problem - I don't know)The File backup feature seems to work fine on the software.I will be returning this and buying an Iomega external HD, as I have a friend that uses the Iomega and is very satisifed with their drive and software for full OS backups."
2,"Software buggy, backups fail","As a few others have written, the PCCloneEX software that is included with this drive crashes about 50% of the time. I also tried to use Norton Ghost to backup to this drive and it failed with a number of errors. Next time I'm sticking with Seagate or Maxtor. The support website for this product is poorly maintained, so don't expect much help from the manufacturer. I'll likely just use this drive for straight file copying as it's useless for system backups."
1,Wouldn't touch these with your system.,"I haven't been bought one of these Cavalry external drives, and I never will after seeing all the fake glowing reviews. I'm going to go with WD or Seagate."
5,WHAT A FIND !,"I am new to the whole external drives thing, however I know that I need to back my files up. Having said this I found this little guy. Nice and small unit fits nice on the desk. Easy to use functions. Transfering data was pretty easy."
4,ITS AN EVERLAST,IF YOU WEAR IT TO WORK OUT AND IT SAYS EVERLAST....PEOPLE KNOW YOU ARE WORKING OUT NOT JUST SOME NUT RUNNING AROUND IN A GARBAGE BAG. THE COLOR IS GREAT AND A LOT LESS GARBAGE BAG LOOKING THAN THE DARKER COLOR SUITS OUT THERE. THIS IS A GOOD SIZE SUIT WITH SOME ROOM IN THE SHOULDERS. SO US BIG GUYS THAT NEED TO SWEAT IT OFF CAN.
1,Pants ripped after first wear,"I just got this and it worked well, fit well, was not tight or anything, I sat down for a bit afterwards and felt a cool breeze. I looked down and the pants had split at the seams, I don't know if it's because the pants were sticking to my legs when I sat down, but they were destroyed after the first use so i am disappointed because they held up good during the workout and were comfortable. I'm looking for something a little more durable for my next purchase"
4,"Everlast Deluxe EVA Sauna Suit - Update: May 10, 2009","This is a nice 'light' sauna suit to have in your possession. By light, I mean, it doesn't feel heavy. So feels suspect to tear but it hasn't, yet. I worn it a few times and no problems. My only gripe is, that the top is difficult to take off - it really clings to my body once I start sweating. The pants have plenty of room, though. All-in-all, I like it.Update (5/10/09):I still have the suit, and yes, it has not ripped, yet. It is durable! Unfortunately, for me, I have found out that if I do not wear a shirt i.e, tank top or T-shirt. I will experience a skin irritation, not a rash but more like a mild burning sensation. The weird thing is, that it only happens on the left side of my body - specifically my shoulder & side torso. So, overall, I still wear the suit and like it but I probably will not purchase a replacement once it tears. Thank you."
1,Collor to Tight !,"The top fit ok on the body, but the elastic around the neck is to tight. Tight were you feel no circulation. There is no adjustment & i don't want to stretch it out and rip it. So i had it exchanged with the same size XL/XX- large and the same situation around the neck. Well can't wear this with out passing out, have to request refund."
3,Kipling Would Love This,"Entertaining if episodic accout of life as a diplomat. At times parochial and old-fashioned, the book reads like a nostalgic take on life in the good old days of the Western Empire."
3,Disturbing,"I am in the process of reading this book (just finished the part about California wine in Marseille), and find it very entertaining. However, does anyone else find the frequency in which local prostitutes are mentioned disturbing? I've lived and travelled overseas quite a bit, and although it's the oldest profession in the world, one would think that the cities the author lived in and visited would have a lot more to describe than the talents of local working girls."
2,Disappointing,"The first 3 or so chapters were promising but it went downhill really fast. I find it really hard to believe that a husband can forgive his wife so easily after being abandoned for 13 years. It made me think of him as being spineless and soft. Also, the romance between Olivia and Nicholas was a joke. After one meeting, they love each other. There was no build up and it was not even believable."
5,Dynamic Characters Stand Out,"The hook of course is our heroine, Annabel, AND her entrance back into town. Knowing LLM for many years I immediately started anticipating who was the had-to-be major dynamic hero, Gabriel. I was not disappointed. All of the major characters had many different colors. Linda maintains her artistic touch to create a masterpience with lots of passionate interaction. In addition to everything, I delighted at the two suprises she saved until the very end! Last but certainly not least the town, Parable, Nevada, was where it HAD to take place."
1,Price is too high for Kindle!,I believe the price is too high for kindle when the average kindle books sells for $7.99 - Afterall it is electronic and there is no paper involved. It shoulds like a reall good book - but at the rate that I read 7 books a week - this price to way to high. I compute 3 hours a day (1.5 each way) and reading makes the compute go by quickly.
5,Best series I've ever watched !!!!,"In this volume, the fights are smarter. I really enjoyed this volume because you can see how good Yujiro Hanma (Baki's father), compare to the other fighters. He just beats anyone in his path. I can't wait to see volume 11 cause Baki will fight someone who will be able to stand toe to toe against him."
5,Number 1 in the UK !,"This outstanding collection was released in the UK on the 30th aniversary of Elvis' passing and entered the UK album charts at number 1! In conjunction with this release, the Suspicious Minds single was re-released in the UK and debuted at number 11 on the UK singles chart! Talk about staying power!While there are numerous Elvis collections available, this is certainly one of the better ones. It includes all his standards, plus several songs that may not have been hits in the US, but were hits in the UK, including: Party, Wooden Heart, Always on My Mind, and I Just Can't Help Believin'. A very strong collection!"
1,Brahms knew better,"For two reasons, I cannot recommend this recording:1 Brahms wrote Op 114 for clarinet, cello, and piano; and Op 40 for horn, violin, and piano. Brahms knew what he was doing: the original wind versions are wonderful. The Bekovas play both with violin, cello, and piano. The alternate all-strings versions just don't compare. (And I'm an amateur violist.)2 The balance on this recording is very heavy on the piano -- the strings are overwhelmed, and often scarcely audible. They are not supposed to be piano solo pieces."
3,Put the things you love in improbable places,"Yet another collection of photographic vignettes. A table pushed in front of a door and piled high with odds and ends. A bed with five or six fabrics randomly tossed over it sitting in front of a kitchen cabinet. Not what most would consider practical design. These photos could have been taken in any antique shop--except for the chicken coop. Add some homey little titles like: ""The dining room is for sharing"" or ""in the bedroom I surround myself with things I love"". If you enjoy bedroom items in the kitchen or vice versa, this book is a must have."
3,NIce but not my style,"I went by the online recommendations and while her style is nice...well its a lot of white which to me isn't practical. And more cottage meets victorian? I am more into clean lines because, well it takes a lot of work to keep up this kind of design. Great for a bed and breakfast style - would love to visit there.Just wanted to let people know that it might not be the style they are interested in."
4,A lovely style and a lovely book,"Ms Westbrook did a fine job defining her style, creating it in her home, and sharing it with the reader. I purchased this book a few years ago, and pull from the bookshelf to page through it again and again. I love the ""feeling"" I get from looking at the lovely photos.As much as I love the book and the style, it's not something I can easily pull together in my own home. I wish I could.Anyone who enjoys this kind of decorating style will surely enjoy this book, and revisit it frequently."
3,it's ok!,"I saw how everyone was going crazy for this book so I bought it. Loved ""Where women create"". Rec'd book while nice I was disappointed. Like i said it's nice just thought it would have been something more."
1,Very weak performance for a B&D product...,"I was highly disappointed with this product because it is extremely weak. The ""blow"" factor was equivalent to that of your hair dryer on the lowest setting. I returned the item."
1,this broke on the first use,This was absolutely horrible. THe very first time we used it it broke with in 10 seconds. Unfortunately it was after the 30 day mark from when we bought it here...
1,constantly breaking--,"I bought this Black and Decker heat gun to use for encaustic painting. I have actually bought this same heat gun 3 times and the third one just died on me. I'm a slow learner, I suppose. I have just learned the cheap power tool lesson. Cheap power tools are a false economy! Now I have to buy my fourth heat gun, and it will definitely NOT be a Black and Decker!"
1,Another burnt out B&D heatgun,"Borrowed it from the neighbor, it burned out after two days of use, perhaps 4 hours runtime. As the other reviews here say, ""junk"" -- don't waste your money."
3,Good and bad...,"I like this one because it has a variable temperature and the plastic housing stays cool. I used it lightly for over a year and then on one day of heavy continuous use (about 20-30 minutes) it just died. Reading the reviews here it seems to be a common issue. Knowing that now (as I place my order for a second one) I will know that it can only be used for shorter durations and that it requires time to cool in between. The same thing happened with my shredder when I tried to over use it (continuous for 30 minutes), so it is just one of those items that has to be used in a cycle of 10min on/10min off."
3,does not fit jeep wrangler unlimited,"Amazon said this product would fit a 2006 jeep wrangler unlimited, but it does not. It is too short and is obviously made for a regular jeep wrangler. Amazon needs to update their information - a unlimited is longer than a regular wrangler because of the extended back!!!"
2,Buy it if you're lost,"As a newbie to Outlook development I was disappointed with the complete lack of useful documentation from MS. This book provides a few general tips to get you started but really lacks any serious punch. It kind of glosses over alot of the object's properties and methods if they're different than the ones used in the book's examples. There is NO mention whatsoever of the ability to connect to DB's with ADO which is kind of shocking, you spend $40 on a book that omits such a huge topic. If You're completely lost and just want to see some code of how things work this book is OK, but there are better resources already online if you just keep hunting for them."
1,Poor organization and wandering style does not deliver,"This book claims to help the reader ""use Outlook Forms to build groupware solutions - fast!"" Unfortunately the author speeds through topics in a fairly unrelated manner, showing the applications on the accompanying CD in just enough detail to show what one could do with Outlook if one had the knowledge. This is where the book falls apart. The knowledge is not presented coherently. One or two well designed applications, taken completely through would be much better than the large set described shallowly. I felt as if I were on a 21 city tour though Europe in three days."
1,Save your money - this is not a developer's guide,If you simply want to learn to use precreated forms - you may get some small value out of this book. If you want to be able to create templates using other objects such as spreadsheets - forget it. This book was a waste of money - especially since I still need to go out and get something that really does give instruction on creating an Outlook application :(
5,The best on creating custom forms!,I have 4 books on this subject and this is by FAR the most thorough on customizing forms for Outlook 98! If you are new to creating forms this is a MUST BUY.
2,Not Completely Useless - Not terribly helpful,"Not a reference work at all. Unless you follow the exercises page-by-page, you will get nothing from this book. I can't wait for the ""For Dummies"" people to write a GOOD book on this topic."
3,"Not a Reference, leads you through some canned mini apps.","If you're looking for a comprehensive Outlook programming reference text, this is not the book. However, as a starting point for Outlook programming (together with the Outlook development Help file, VBScript HTML-based help and KnowledgeBase articles -- all from Microsoft) it's really all that's available. It leads you through some reasonable, canned Outlook applications but it's missing hardcore information about the Object Model, publishing into your Organization, Office Template forms, all the GUI Objects, Properties, etc."
1,"If you're building ap's for the 1st time, this isn't it.","I purchased this book hoping to find out how to create forms that other could use in my organization. This is something the book claims to be able to do but it looks like it must have been written by someone that created Outlook because too many things seem to be missing, taken for granted by the author, that I can't piece together. I feel like I wasted my money. My biggest mistake was not to purchase the book I wanted from Amazon where I could choose the author of my choice instead of making due with whatever was on the shelf at a book store."
1,Product not adversited NOT WHAT I received,I ordered 2 - 24x30 poster board I received 2- 8x10 photo sheets. I have contacted buy but no response.
4,Really good,I've just recentley finished reading Silver is for secrets and i couldnt put it down i just recieved it in the mail yesterday and i already finished it. Stacey and her friends including her boyfriend Jacob have all rented a cabin by the beach for the summer before they go off to college. Then they meet this girl Clara and Stacey starts having nightmares about her and she trys to keep her from being killed while in the meantime Clara is causing all kinds of problems and it ends in a horrible cliffhanger. (i hate cliffhangers) But it was a really good book i recommend it to everyone i've even pre-ordered my copy of Red is for Rememberance the 4th book in the bifn series. Happy reading!
2,Silver is For Secrets,"I gave my daughter these books for Christmas '06. By January 10, 07 the title has worn off of this book. I asked her if she wanted me to return it for a replacement and she doesn't want to be without the text for that long. I am very disappointed that the artwork isn't remaining on the cover."
3,Okay...,"Well personally i loved the first two books. i thought they were both exciting and just plain GREAT!!! But this book, Silver is for Secrets, had a wonderful story line and great events along the way. But the ending just didn't seem to fit, a frat cruise come on. But i guess all in all it was just average nothing really different that set it apart from other books (something the first two definately had). I reccomend this book to those who are just bored and need something to read."
5,Best but sadest book ever!!,"This book was the best. I read it in 2 days, I couldnt put it down. You have to read it, but I made the mistake by reading this book befor I read White is for Magic or Blue is for Nightmares. So if I could go back Id read those first. And Im not going to spoil the ending for you, but its very surprising and made me cry for a LONG time. You HAVE to read it!!"
1,Dead blog,I just started the trial and got a post dated 2 weeks ago which says that this blog no longer exists. The blogger must have forgotten to tell Amazon that he stopped doing the blog.
2,Not happy with CD,Receivied CD in what appears to be a scratched condition. CD won't play well in my vehicle... Almost appears to be a book leg version. Not happy with item.
4,One of the best biking and hiking sagas!,"Bruce Junek writes well, and Tass Thacker's photographs are excellent. They give you a good idea of the people and places they visit. They are also very kind and likable people.Whether they are trekking, biking, meeting the locals, learning the languages, eating the local food (occasionally becoming ill!), you really like these two people. This cannot always be said of other adventurous types who might seem self-centered or petulant. And while not many will want to duplicate their entire trip, there are parts of it that could be easily copied (e.g., Nepal, New Zealand and Australia).Wish they'd had even more time to explore and write about their adventures."
4,Share an extraordinary experience - bike around the world,Bruce and Tass relate their experiences biking around the world. Share in their emotions and experiences as they learn more about those with whom we share the planet.They are truly great people with whom I would have gladly travelled. I have met the author (he puts on slide shows for schools) and he is a terrific person. He makes you believe that anyone can do what they did. I didn't want the book to end...I wanted them to keep going
1,The road of the disjointed,"This book started off with great Promise, of an adventure. However,the writer was all over the map, Figuratively, and did not seem to be able to flesh anything thing in detail. A mish mash of ideas and things thrown together for a book. Yes there was adventure there, He maybe should have hired a ghost writer instead of spending five years for this effort, I think money would have well spent if he had done this. I am sure that the slide show is much better."
3,"Not quite right, a bit of a disappointment","I've several recordings of the Tchaikovsky, none of the Glazunov, and so at least half of this album was going to be exciting. On the other hand, I noticed that the performers are ASMIF Chamber. Since their performance has always been wonderful, I would have gotten this album even if I had ten of the Glazunov. Sadly, though, I didn't like the presentation. In both pieces, the ensemble seems to rush into them and then through them. The Tchaikovsky lacks fluidity (Iona Brown did a marvellous performance with the Norwegian Symphony) and depth, and the movements go by with too much energy and speed to actually be able to appreciate the melodies. The Glazunov, a piece familiar to most classical music lovers, is also rushed. Sorry to say, I can't really recommend the album, but those liking music that is speedy, even seemingly competitive, would enjoy."
5,Movie Themes with a Classical Twist,"What's not to like about a good song from a good movie? All the classic movie themes (i.e., Titanic, Zorba the Greek, etc.) are here but played by a full orchestra.I considered this approach to modern music a true and distinct pleasure and a nice break from the classical music that Andre Rieu's orchestra normally presents. The music is uplifting and makes you want to break out in song or get up and dance.Nice background music for a long auto trip. Fun for the family to sing along with. Also a great album for just 'having on' in the house while you do other things. Good also for background music (at a lower volume) when entertaining.I am a fan of Andre Rieu and absolutely adore how he has brought the sound of a full orchestra to today's modern songs. If you like classical music you will like this CD."
5,Absolutely wonderful!,So many of my favorites and the arrangements and playing are just wonderful. I can listen to this CD all day.
5,Andrew Rieu ~ excellent,This is an excellent compilation of favorites performed by Andre Rieu. You can listen to it for hours and hours and never get tired of the great work.
4,very beautiful,This cd is very beautiful. It captures the songs wonderfully. The orchestra does a fine job.
4,Great music,I use this cd to go to sleep at night. I love Andre!!! I have several of his cd's LOVE IT
5,Love it!,Andre never disappoints. I wish I had every CD he's made and will be looking for more. Very relaxing music.
1,Gave my baby a rash,"I bought these for my 10 month old daughter thinking they would be great for teething and snacking. These cookies gave my baby a terrible rash and the runs. She normally never has these kinds of reactions to food. Never again Gerber, never again."
1,DANGEROUS,These cookies are too small and pose a choking hazard! After my daughter put the entire cookie in her mouth and nearly choked TWICE I threw them away. I wouldn't recommend them to anyone!
3,nice sandals,These are nice but the elastic is a little too snug. I hope it loosens a little because right now they aren't that comfortable. It's a good thing I got the wide size (I don't usually buy wide) otherwise I think I would have had to return it.
5,Classic English Classical Music,"If you don't know John Ireland: A Downland Suite, you are about to experience the lushness of the British countryside on a warm summer's day. How else to explain the emotional pull of such a beautifully rich, sweeping musical narrative? Even though Mr. Ireland's career was centered mainly in London, I sense the open vistas and fresh air of the more rural places in England when I listen to this favorite."
5,Another Hidden Gem,"This is another good band recommended by my Pandora station. Describing music is always a challenge, so I'll give it my best shot. Mostly this album is lo-fi indie rock, pretty much quiet and sedate with no squealing guitars or any of that. It's more the album you put on when you want to relax, not when you want to dance. From start to finish it's consistently good without any cringe-inducing songs you have to skip. ""Low"" is my favorite so far as that's the first one I ever heard, but I'm sure I'll have some other favorites after I listen to it more. And believe me, I will be listening to it some more.That is all."
3,"Great for large bikes, not so great for small ones","I bought 3 racks to hold two adult bikes and my kids 3 bikes. The full size bikes fit great and the rack holds them securely. The small tires on the smaller bikes don't really fit.When the small bikes are parked with the front tire in the rack, the front fork hits the rack and prevents it from going all the way in. When the small bikes are parked with the back tire in the rack, the rear sprocket hits the rack and prevents it from going all the way in. Either way, the smaller tires won't seat all the way and the bike tips half way over. The rear tire works better than the front tire for the smaller bikes, but is still not a very good fit. I should have bought only one of these Racor racks for our large bikes and something different for the small bikes."
2,"It works, but is not of the highest quality.","This rack is fairly cheaply constructed of light aluminum tubing. When assembling the rack, as with many foreign made assemble yourself items, not all the parts fit together as they should, and I had to take the drill to it in order to get it together. I should have probably returned it, but did not want the hassle, so spent about 30 minutes making adjustments. Once together, it works fine. I would recommend that you go to your local bike store (LBS) and check out the welded steel racks that they will most likely stock. I found several really nice welded powder coated racks at my LBS for about the same as this. Wish I would have checked their first."
4,Good Product at a Reasonable Price,"The only complaint i have for this product is that the brake disc hits the bars. My bike has 26"" wheels and it's a pretty close fit. If you have a 29er this my not work for you. And before you ask, yes I tried putting both wheels in and the discs hit on the front and rear. And yes I also tried putting the wheels in from both sides. The 26"" wheels won't fit in the back way (with the curved bars). Just be careful how you put your bike in if you have disc brakes and you should be fine."
4,Appears to be a good quality (sturdy) bike rack for both road and mountain bikes,"I bought hits rack based upon other reviews. I was seeking a sturdy rack to hold two road bikes. I wanted a rack that would hold the wheel in place without placing weight or pressure on the spokes. And I needed a rack that would look okay inside the house. This meets all.Either the front or rear wheel can be used so I've placed my two bikes at opposites to avoid the handlebars from hooking. If you set it by the rear wheel, then the rear derailluer needs to be in a larger cassette ring so the derailluer is out of the way.I think the price was good, it was easy to assemble, and it shipped from Amazon in a couple of days (as expected).Yea, I'd buy another."
4,Does the Job,Two 5th graders put this together in less than 30 minutes. Holds two bikes - one kid-size and one adult - with ease. I like that I can move it around the garage depending upon what projects are going on in there. I don't like that the soft plastic end caps come off easily and one has gone missing already.
2,Unproper Fit of Screws,"The construction of the bike stand seemed sturdy enough to hold two bicycles upright. But I encountered that the screw holes are not aligned. The base was easy enough, no problems with the hole alignment, but once you put the upright stands and supports, the holes were not aligned. I was able to screw the support posts from the top, but the holes to the base did not align at all; although, it does keep in place in the hole slots. Will keep the unit because it still hold the bikes upright, but I'm using as a maintenance stand."
2,hard to balance ; hits spokes.,"Got it on sale for $30ish. If that were the normal price instead of the $41 MSRP, i'd be less surprised by what arrived.The I-beam floor construction makes it fairly hard to assemble and have the result be level. There are better ways to build stands.The angle of the uprights aren't adjustable, so smaller wheels -- in my case, 26"" mountain bike wheels -- will rest awkwardly and the bike has a tendency to prop itself up by bracing against the spokes of whichever wheel you put in.Not really a great stand. If you have big fat tires on a 29er wheel, it should work fine, but for normal bikes... eh. I've returned it."
3,Missing parts,I was dissapointed to find that I was missing one of each type of screw (three screws total) to assemble this bike rack. I had to call the company and request the missing parts then wait about a week to receive them. But other than that it was an easy assembly. Overall it it is a decent value and a handy storage solution.
4,good stand,This was not difficult to put together as previous posts have stated. I am a fix-it-yourself type of girl though. This stand is perfect for my two youngest boys bmx bikes. They do not have kickstand so they were always propped up on something or falling over. My sons like it because they can bring it outside the garage and use it in the driveway.
3,Don't waste your money,"This thing actually sucks your front tire in. I have to plant one foot on the bike rack and yank my front tire loose from it. I could not fit two mountain bikes on it side by side so close. It has no traction whatsoever and slides around constantly. If you are using this inside your home it will be an issue. And one of the parts was threaded badly, and I had to use a lot of force to re-thread it with the bolts they sent. You could probably do better with two cinder blocks."
4,great bike stand for the price,"This stand is perfect for the garage or even in the back of the truck to keep the bikes upright. It was easy to assemble and is very sturdy. However, it is not good for mountain bikes with disc brakes. The disc will rub up against the rails and will have to be covered."
5,A1 Bike Rack,We love the bike rack. When we aren't using it in the garage we take it to bike races. The bikes sit perfect in the back of the van in the rack.The bikes fit right into the slots without having to strap them in. We love how it is so portable too. Great product.
1,save your money minimize frustration,product was not designed for easy assembly - it fits together sloppy and doesn't lay flat without persuassion. I'm not new to tools - this was just poorly manufactured in terms of the end user.
4,functionality,"The bike stand has lived up to our expectations. It has adjustable features and works well in the space we have. The rubber caps could fit a little better, though."
2,"Got the package,....","but there were no screws in the box. It seemed like someone ordered this before me and returned it. Or in transit, box was abused so bad that the screws fell out? Anyway, couldnt put it together, so had to return it."
5,bike stand,"We have four bikes - 2 adults and two teenager. So, I bought two stands, and they work perfectly in my garage. I turned it around for the kids' bikes and put the front tire in first. We have had no problem with them toppling over. Even my 5 year old daughter is putting her bike by herself. I was very tired of tripping over bikes - its nice to firstly have a way to keep the bikes upright, and secondly have a slot for the bikes in the garage.Bonus I put a razor standing scooter on it as well and it works perfectly fine. It doesn't affect the spaces for the bike.The price is not too bad too so I would recommend this to anyone."
3,Functional but came rusty,"Just got it today. It's working fine, sturdy. If you have tile floors, it will slip around but bikes have no problem parking into it.The tubing was already rusted before it was painted, clear signs of rust bubbles and slight peeling. Some tubes even showed signs of use, with scratches, scuffs and dust/dirt on the wheel loops. Seems to me like they dumped returned parts back into the assembly line.Will keep it since it's just a bike stand, not really worth the trouble of returning."
3,Beware if you have DISK brakes,Product seems to be built just fine. Problem is it does not work for mountain bikes with disk brakes. So beware if your bike(s) have disk brakes.
3,Decent product,"So I have a road bike and a mountain bike in the stand the road bike is a 58cm and the mountain bike I typically use as a commuter is a 21"". The stand holds the bikes vertically like I desired it is more in the way the wheel fits inside the metal hooop. The roadie fits snugly against the tire I put the road bike nose in because the stand contacts the rear derailure. Both bikes do not fit facing the same direction so I put the mountain bike with the rear in. The mountain bike tires are 2.25"" and that is about the maximum I belive this stand will accomodate.Don't expect top not fit and finish for the final assembled product because you're not paying for that.In the user photos my rack is the white and yellow specialized."
2,assessmbly issue,"The way these pieces fit together is laughable. It works....good enough.....which is what I'm assuming the designers finally decided on. In the end, 2 bolts will not line up. It works, but you get what you pay for as usual"
3,"Come on, guys!","I read the reviews of others with wrong pieces in their boxes, but I thought I would get lucky. Nope. I had the same problem. I bored a new hole through mine to make it work. It does work well. We have 2 sizes of kids bikes and both fit nicely on the stand. The kids like having their bike stand and I like not having bikes scattered on the the floor of the garage."
3,Not for Side-by-Side,"The unit is sturdy and well built. It was straightforward to assemble and then I put the bikes in it. Or tried to. My wife and I have hybrid bikes - a road version of a mountain bike. The handle bar width didn't allow them to sit side by side as the unit is designed to do and pictured. My solution was to reassemble the unit with each bike mounted in the unit from opposite directions. As long as you have space to accommodate this arrangement, it works well."
4,"Simple, yet versatile","Good for basic, on-floor bike storage. Allows you to configure it two different ways (side-by-side or end-to-end) and can be used with front or back tires. Should work with most bicycle tire widths. Fairly lightweight, which is a plus or minus based on whether you need to move it or want it to stay put. I have mine propped against a metal shelf stand, which keeps it from sliding around too much."
2,Not good for kids bikes,"This bike stand was advertised as being a good bike stand for kids bikes, yet it does not hold my son's 16"" bike and barely supports my daughter's 18"" bike. Also, you cannot put two bikes side by side in the stand without the handlebars getting tangled. I returned it and ended up getting two single stands from Academy Sports that are perfect for what I needed. I hate to write a bad review about something, but this is not a good bike stand for all bikes. In support of Amazon, I will say the return process was easy and free."
2,Smells like mothballs,"I bought this stand to keep our bikes upright in the guest bedroom. Stand is solid (though kind of a pain to put together), but otherwise great. A few days after we got it in there, we noticed a weird smell in the bedroom. Turned out it was the rubber feet of the stand. They have a very strong motor oil and mothball odor to them. I took them off, washed them, and let them air out. After a month outside they still smell horrible. Now, the stand slides around when I put the bikes in, but it's too big of a PITA to send it back."
2,Not for Touring Bikes,"OK for bikes without any racks or fenders. If you have a touring bike, forget this stand. Front and rear wheel racks both prevent the wheel from entering the stand, fenders will be damaged if they do fit. Placing the rear wheel of an adult bike into the stand may damage rear cassette and/or derailer. Would work ok for naked tired, 26"" and above bikes. Slots are too close together to avoid side-by-side bikes from rubbing against each other. Could be an ok stand, but not in present size and configuration.If it hadn't taken so long to assemble, I would be returning it, but will probably just give it to someone who has inexpensive kids bikes.Not recommended."
3,Ok for inside,"This bike stand was purchased for outside and every time the wind blows, it along with my 2bikes blow over. I purchased a cinder block to weigh it down and now it is fine. It was easy to assemble."
4,Serves it purpose,I ordered two of these to keep the bikes off the floor in the garage. They work like a charm for that. Kids use the racks so the garage isn't a bike junk yard. Not super heavy duty but ok for your garage. Can't beat the price.
4,works well,"We have three of these racks and they all work well though some were harder to put together than others. They work well with multiple bike types (29""/26"" mountain bikes, road bikes, touring bikes, etc) even if they have disc brakes."
4,"Works great, but doesn't hold two road bikes well.",The stand does not hold two road bikes very well side by side. It works but even an inch wider would have made a huge difference.
4,Does the job well for the price,"Assemply is a a little tricky, but this stand works well for parking two bikes. I like the fact that I did not have to put any permanent holes in the wall or ceiling and that I can move it around at will."
4,Sturdy but light,This bike stand is going to work well for my son to park his two bikes. I moves when he takes the bike in or out but not to an irritating level. It was easy to assemble and came with the tools to do it. I may buy another one in the future for my husband's bikes. It is way better than them lying around all over the driveway or garage!
5,Works well and great value for money,"This bike rack is solidly made and I am able to store our two adult bikes in it with no problem. The rubber end ""feet"" do have a slightly peculiar smell, but could easily be removed if you wanted to use this indoors. I dont fully understand the comments about taking up a lot of space - bikes do anyway, and if you want them standing apart then they will take up even more space, so that is to be expected.My only criticism is that the instructions could have been a little clearer, although it wasnt difficult to assemble.Overall an excellent purchase for the price."
5,Perfect!,"This bike rack is easy to put together, is compact, yet fits two bikes perfectly. I would highly recommend this!"
5,Excellent!,"I am very happy with my bike stand -- it works exactly as it's supposed to. Kick stands are not dependable in the wind, and by using this very sturdy stand, my bikes are stay put in any weather, and take up much less room."
4,Bike rack,"My two bikes now stand proudly in my spare bedroom. The problem I had was the 4 rubber (non-skid) end caps were made out of some real bad smelling rubber. I noticed the smell as soon as I saw the box on my porch. At first I thought it was the box, then I thought it was the plastic bag the parts were wrapped in. After it sat in my bedroom overnight, it smelled up the room, which I noticed even with the door closed and window open. I had to put it outside, but it took a week for the smell to leave. Then I soaked the 4 rubber caps in soapy water, but it did no good. I threw them out and the bike rack sits on the carpet. I'm glad I resolved the problem because this was to be for inside my home."
1,Missing in Action,I guess I shouldn't have been surprised that my box arrived today without the hardware. How many Amazon customers have to complain about this before something is done?
4,Bike Stand,Very good. Relatively easy to assemble. Pretty sturdy for the price. All parts there and arrived quickly.
2,Poor Quality,"Expect to have problems with assembly. Hardware is of poor quality. I always seem to have more problems with items that use hex wrenches to assemble. This item is not well designed and the fit is poor.In the end, it was difficult to put together. Once done, the item appears to be just solid enough to do the job."
3,Poor Quality Control,"I bough two of these, but could only put one together. The factory had somehow managed to omit threading one of the rod inserts of the other stand. Otherwise, the spacing between the two stands is a little tight, especially for two similar size bikes. The end caps are easily removable, should you wish to add some ballast."
5,great stand,I have four bikes I keep inside my house. I keep this in the living room so I can keep whatever bike I'm riding that day easily available. I usually put the wheel in one slot and the bike in the other. It holds both road & mountain bikes.
5,Excellent Bike Stand,"Received my bike stand in a timely manner & was very pleased with it. Firstly, the packaging was nice & simple. As simple as it seems to put together, I only experienced some problems aligning the bent bars to the base. You'll have to somewhat toy with that to get it aligned with the long U-tube section. Regardless, once completely assembled, you'll be thoroughly happy with this 2 bike stand. It's great!!!! I was worried that regardless of which tire you put into the stand that the bike may still fall over to the side, but that's NOT the case. Very sturdy & definitely accommodates your bike with any tire inserted. I use this stand in my apartment & couldn't have been happier. A++!!"
3,Bike stand works,"My recent purchase of the Racor bike stand works fine for racking bikes from the front wheel. You cannot rack from the back wheel because the cassette hits the metal rack. Since both of my bikes are road bikes, the handlebars hit each other when they are racked but it work OK.However, it would be better if the bikes could be racked by the front or back wheel."
5,Works great with two 26inch mountain bikes,"Assembles easily. Fits our two 26"" Mountain bikes great. They both won't fit handlebars first you have to turn one around to make it work. We don't have disk brakes on our bikes though."
4,Great rack for the price,"It was pretty easy to put together. It only took about 20 minutes. However, I highly recommend putting it together loosely until you've finished, then tightening everything up.The bike rack works well. We use it in the side-by-side way. Sometimes the bikes are a bit crowded. We find that if you put one in backwards, it works better.Overall, it was a good bike rack for the inexpensive price."
3,"Great value, hard to assemble","Mine was hard to assemble -- the way the tubes lined up, the screws entered the threaded holes at an angle, and wouldn't go in without stripping the threads. With a mallet and some effort I was able to bend a couple of the pieces just enough to make the screws enter properly. I don't fault it too much for this because the rack is so cheap; if it was more expensive I would expect the pieces to be engineered a bit better. Overall, a good value."
4,Black Metal Bike Stand,The product shipped quickly. It was easy to assemble and reasonably priced. Easily accommodates two small adult size bikes. It was what I expected. I am pleased with the product.
3,Good Value,"This is a solid product and a good value (at ~$30 including shipping), BUT, the assembly instructions leave ALOT to be desired. Once together, this is a good product, a good deal. I'd buy another and/or recommend it to others."
4,racor bike stand,Assembly was not too bad although one of the needed screws was missing so I had to make a substitute. Product appears to be well-made.
5,Just what I wanted,"This is the perfect answer to my need for a bike stand. In fact, I got two because I have 3 and sometimes 4 bikes to store. They can be used indoors or out. Great!"
4,JKentucky,Received the rack with all parts and directions enclosed. Directions were adequate but used the diagram more than the written directions. Tools were supplied (small wrench and allen wrench). Parts did fit together but not well. Small screws needed allen wrench. If they had used Phillips screws instead it would have been easier to assemble. The base did not sit level. If they used a different style of end cap it could eliminate this problem. It did handle my hybrid and racing bike very well. For the price it is very functional. Would have given it five stars except for the fitting together of the parts and for a level base.
5,good product,"Easy assembly. Solid construction. If you are looking for this type of a floor rack, this product works well."
4,The Almost Perfect Bikestand,"I'd call this product almost perfect for two reasons. 1)the put-together was a little bit tricky. Parts didn't exactly match up with other parts, requiring a little more skill and effort than the product description suggested. 2) there could be more space between the two stands. I currently have my mountain bike (with the wide wings on the bars) and my road bike side by side. I guess I could put one in backward to avoid the bar collision problem. Other than that, the stand does make my life easier and my garage neater, and offers a level of protection in that it keeps my bikes from hitting the floor as they occasionally did."
3,O.K. for the price,Relatively inexpensive. Does o.k. with small bikes. A little bit of a pain to put together.
2,Not for adult bikes,This is a nice little rack. It really is not sized for adult bikes. Even the advertised photo shows childrens bikes. Just be aware
2,doesn't fit our bikes??,"Whose bikes fit in this thing? Our two girls' bikes don't fit - if their little wheels don't fit in there, then this must be only for road bikes with skinny tires. If so, they should probably inform buyers of that. So my girls' bikes' tires only go in a few inches, balance delicately, and if they are bumped at all, they just fall over. Plus, the product was short one screw, so I just added a bolt and duct tape. Disappointed."
2,Its ok...not a good fit,"I was very excited to get a rack for the bikes but it didn't fit right. Perhaps a better fit for large adult bikes. But not with gears, etc. Will need to return."
1,Item is sent with missing parts in a sealed box,"This item has been mailed in a sealed box with missing parts (all the screws, nuts, wrenches, etc.). This has happened twice, once with the original and again with the replacement. The support email and phone number in the manual is out of date, and Racor support has been largely unresponsive. Please be careful."
5,great,"great size, lightweight but sturdy enough to support two large mountain bikes. used daily for over 2 years and still completly held it's shape and functions great"
4,Just what I needed! An Inexpensive Durable Stand!,"My husband and I purchased bicycles in May. We live in an apartment and wanted to keep our bikes in the spare bedroom. My goal was to get a small stand to make the room look more organized, and this fit the bill perfectly!Pros: Cheap, Easy to Assemble, Small Form FactorCons: When put together, the stand is slightly off balance. (That is, the two bars that contact the floor aren't completely level.) This doesn't affect it's perfomance at all, but it is an annoyance.Bottom Line: This bike stand lived up to my expectations. We've used it for about 6 months now, and I am very pleased with the overall quality for the price. I would definitely buy this product again!"
4,Racor PBS-2R Floor Bike Stand,"The Racor bike stand works well. It assembles easily in 2 different positions (2 bikes side by side or opposing sides). In the side by side position, bike handle bars may interfere with each other if at the same height, due to the closeness of the individual slots, but is not a big problem. Putting one bike in forwards and the other backwards eliminates that minor issue. The materials are solid and are heavy enough to support 2 bikes. Overall this product works well."
1,missing pieces,"Can't rate the product 'cause I can't put it together. Box was not taped for shipping and arrived without the bag of hardware. If you're going to buy one, find one in a store if you can and inspect it carefully before taking it home. Shame on Amazon."
5,Bike Stand,"I purchased this bike stand for our bikes at home, while not in use. I was surprised that it was so easy to put together and very sturdy once assembled. Which by the way, the assembly took less time to complete than unpacking the box and gathering my screwdrivers. I first used the stand in the rear of my truck to stabilize my bike. I had to transport my bike from the bike shop and get it home. My SPECIALIZED bike does not have a kickstand and I do not drive prudently and even in a moving vehicle this stand kept my bike stable, at highway speeds nonetheless! I realize this stand was not made for my particular application, but it worked very well and if it can handle a 50 mile ride home in the bed of my pickup it will do excellent in your garage holding your carbon fiber, full suspension, limited edition. Needless to say the stand works very well keeping my wife's bike and my bike in place. Great value, great product, easy to assemble and quick shipping."
3,Could have a better design,"Assembly can take longer than you expect due to the instruction sheet provided. It does not indicate that the upright tubes need to be inserted in only one correct direction. After figuring that out it seem to come together quite well and upon completion I was quite happy with it. It's sturdy and stable.But as others have mentioned bikes with large 28"" tires don't fit properly (27"" also won't fit... from another reviewer). The tire hits the top of the wheel support tubes and will not touch the floor. I feel that they should disclose size accomadation in the specs. I'll probably keep the rack but these are a few things potentials buyers should be aware of. FYI, my bikes are both Hybrid types with 700C tires (28"")."
1,"Junk, Junk, Junk","I am not one to give bad reviews but this is absolute junk... maybe it was just the batch that I got, but nothing fits correctly and the screws strip... this is pure junk."
2,Poor Quality control,Once assembled the rack is OK. I received a rack with defective parts in that the required holes had not been made in one of the U brackets and the parts did not fit together easily. Considerable force was required to get the parts assembled in position. Customer service was responsive with replacement parts to replace the defective U.
4,Decent product,Didn't take too long to put together with kids on my lap. Seems sturdy enough and is waaaaaay better than bikes on the floor or leaning against things in the garage all the time. I never thought to look at the local home improvement store though and could have purchased the same thing for the same price without waiting.
4,Racor PBS-2R does it job,"This bike stand does what it's supposed to do. I bought it because I wanted to put my 2 mountain bikes in the garage. I don't want to hang them up on the wall and the other stands that lean against the wall where you put one bike on top of another, don't look too sturdy to me. So I went with this conventional bike stand.Installation was very simple; instructions were clear and easy to follow. The only negative thing I can say about this stand is that the wheel slots are too close to each other. My 2 mountain bikes, if I put them both facing the same direction, the handle bars on the bikes will get tangled up a little. Other than that, like I said, this stand does what it's supposed to."
1,THIS ORDER HAD PIECES MISSING!!,This order was a huge disappointment because when the package arrived there were 4 main pieces missing and we couldn't put together the bike rack. Conclusion? We lost our money and now we have a bunch of useless pieces. I DON'T recomend this product!!
1,avoid at all cost,package was missing all hardware and over half of the supporting bars! What a joke - look somewhere else if at all possible.
3,Works but Allen Nuts strip way too easy.,"I was looking for storage solution for my bikes. I am happy with this stand so far, but when I was putting it together, the allen wrench stripped the allen nuts way too easily - so if I want to disassemble or rearrange, I would likely have to get new nuts. Overall happy but the quality of the nuts is very disappointing."
3,Mediocre build quality,"Rack seems to work just fine-- I bought two of them to accomodate my families four bikes. I intentionally put my XL frame mountain bike next to my 11 year olds smaller bike because I think the fit would be a little tight if I shared one of these racks with another adult bike.I'm underwhelmed with the manufacturing quality- while assembling the two units, multiple hex bolts started to strip with only minimal pressure applied. It was more difficult to assemble than it needed to be because the parts just werent that carefully machined. Still, I guess you can't expect perfection for $25 and I was able to assemble two of the units in under a half hour."
2,Too small...,"The rack seems to have a decent build quality, but it's too small. Two adult size bikes, for example, don't fit side-by-side on the rack because the handlebars interfere with each other, so one bike ends up leaning over. Also, the loops for the tires barely fit a 26"" tire, and a 26"" tire ends up getting wedged in, so you have to hold the rack with your foot to get the bike out. I'm giving this one away, and certainly wouldn't have bought it if I knew then what I knew now."
4,Not bad,"This product is not bad, and for the price should be awesome. Only reason I deducted one star from it is because it is has some difficulties getting my bike's tire in (Diamondback dual sport) whereas my wife's bike is easier. Also, if the holders were spaced 5 inches more apart, it would have made storing the bikes facing the same direction much easier. For now the bikes have to '69' in order to fit well."
3,As advertised except missing hardware,"This is a great deal for a simple and value oriented bike stand, as mentioned before a mountain bike with disk brakes doesnt fit. Also this seems to ship out without hardware, the first shipment came with no bolts, the replacement came with some but still missing some. Dont expect it all be there."
3,It's ok.,It's very light weight. It becomes kind of clumsy. Also the bikes seemed to be a little to close when trying to put them away.
1,"Too small for normal sized bike, cheap, expensive to return","Don't bother. It's too small for ordinary bicycles, it's poor quality, and from an unfriendly seller.I have two normal, adult hybrid bicycles I needed storage for. This rack is too small, period. The wheels do not fit into the stand. The box says ""Ideal for Kids' Bikes"" by which it must mean ""Only Suitable for Miniature Bikes!""It also ships in the original packaging, with all the hardware just floating around in there. Good luck getting all the screws you need. I'm returning it - minus shipping, mandatory insurance, and a 25% restocking fee. Yep, that's the seller's policy.You're much better off finding something at a local sporting goods store, and making sure it fits. This stand is just an expensive, cheap inconvenience."
3,Great bike floor stand,It arrived fast and complete with all hardware and directions. All simple tools were supplied to assemble the pieces.Light but sturdy and holds my bikes securely. I'd buy another one.
3,sturdy but too small,"This bike stand is sturdy and inexpensive, but it is definitely a squeeze to get two adult mountain bikes into it, either both facing the same direction or facing opposite directions. We are still using it, but have to wrestle with it a bit every time we get our bikes out (which is several times per week). If it were just a little wider, it would be perfect."
1,Do not buy the Racor PBS-2R Bike Stand,"When box was delivered - it actually smelled like it had been stored in someone's attic - mothball smell - Yuck.I've already spent hours on this thing just trying to put it together. I believe that we don't have the right parts.I've been waiting for my husband to help me with this. I had this delivered in June and nowAmazon says that the last day to return it was July 7-so I'm stuck with something that Amazon knows is inferior.I made the mistake of purchasing this without first reading the reviews. You see the reviews go back to 2004 all complaining that the correct parts are not all included. Why does Amazon,LLC continue to sell this thing when they know that Consumers will be unable to put it together?"
4,Nice Rack....,"This rack holds my 29er and my kids BMX 20"" frame bikes.Assembly was easy and the overall product is sturdy. Fits nicely in my side port.Only thing from making this perfect is the hardware: the allen screws did not fit the supplied wrench. Had to use my set(s).This is a way better option then the wall mounted racks that are out there."
2,Works OK but build quality is iffy,"Others have mentioned bum parts, and I had that problem as well. In my case, one of the slugs that you bolt into was crooked, too far into the tube, and wasn't tapped. Luckily, I have a tap and die set that I'm not afraid to use. In addition, you have to jump through some hoops to get the frame true. So, I wouldn't recommend this product, unless you're willing to do some work."
3,Is what it is,Works as advertised. Takes a little patience to put together. But once it is it works as advertised. And the price reflects that. I would expect more if it cost more so it is what it is.
3,Quality issues but you get what you pay for ?,"Its not the most well made product but I guess for the price, you get what you get. One of the screws would not go in, seems like threads were damaged and won't engage, but I forced it and once you put it together it has a cross bar so it's pretty sturdy.Once you got it setup, it works well and holds up my bike pretty well."
1,More Chinese-made Junk,"Add my voice to those who have complained that the parts are misaligned. This cannot be put together, so it's worthless!"
3,Good Stand,"Stand is good, not great but works for keeping the bikes off the floor. Assembly directions are not the easiest to read and I had to disassemble a few parts because I installed them in the wrong direction. The directions were not specific on which way certain holes go in order to attach all parts. Just look ahead a step or 2 and it can be figured out. Read all steps before asembling."
2,"Poor quality, but still works for 26"" and 700cc disc brake bikes","It took me 1.5 hours to assemble due to parts misalignment. I had no problem tputting my mountain bike 26"" wheels and hybrid bike with disc brakes 700cc using front wheels. Very poor quality product. One end is raised due to poor assembly. I'll keep (it too much trouble to disassemble and ship back for $18 item)."
5,Good introduction to the autoloader pistol,"Very much a knife, fork spoon book on shooting. Very well written by one of the best in the field.Ayoob gives the reasons for a police department switching to the semi-automatic pistol. The advantages and disadvantages of the pistol and revolver are reviewed. While the arguments are aimed at the police officer they would also apply to the person looking for a personal defense sidearm.As always a pleasure to read and very useful. If you want practical information this is a good book for you cop or civilian."
4,Great cd,"New England is hard-driving guitar work, rich in keyboards, with a hint of Brittish-style vocals for a flavor which put them near the top of my fav. list, second only to Boston. So, it is without hesitation that I can wholeheartedly recommend Explorer Suite. Explorer Suite is noticably more mainstream in its sound conpared to the groups' debut effort. However, New England masterfully put together this album retaining the driving sound of great '70's era rock while intertwining some of the early to mid 80ish new-wave type of sound. If you dug The Cars and Loverboy, go ahead, indulge yourself. You'll be glad you did. While you're at it, go ahead and pick up the first album as well. You'll save youself the time and effort for which you could be listening to your new cd's!!!"
1,Glasses still bead on the outside,I ordered 2 and after 2 months they have no cracks but the outside of it sweats badly with anything icy that I put in it.
5,Still enjoying this Artist,"I think the albums so far benefit hugely from Charlie Peacock's involvement, his musical ideas beautifully complement Sarah's distinct voice and original vocal arrangements.I am still enjoying all the Sarah Masen albums I have. Carry Us Through would be my favourite. They all make great albums to have in the car."
5,Lyrically smart,"I've enjoyed both of her releases. They're lyrically smart, honest and musically solid. I hope she offers a third release."
3,Think Twice Before Buying,The color of the table is pewter not black as stated in the description.The table and leg base are separate and require assembly. The assembly requires a rubber mallet to get the legs popped into the table evenly.The table is fine and serves it purpose well for the money.Next time I will spend the extra money and get a table of a heavier weight and better quality.
4,Costly but worth it,Very sturdy and the fold up feature is quite helpful and well designed. A little pricey but well worth it. Nice weatherproof finish.
3,Pioneer Scrapbook Sheet Protectors.,"The clarity of the sheets were great, but they were difficult to keep in place. They tend to slip away from center of the scrapbook page they cover and have to be continuously be repositioned after turning a page."
4,One of the pioneers,"Macron 1 helped pioneer today's modern Mech-Anime's. Taking elements from shows like Macross and others like Voltron and G-Force, Macron 1 successfully pulled of an awe inspiring blend of action and adventure, and INCREDIBLE music :) I'll never forget hearing Axel F during the series!"
1,Disappointed,"I bought four of these and all of them were the ugly pink one. The description said ""randomly selected colorS"" I assumed the ""S"" on colors meant they would send a selection. I ordered four, why not get all four colors?? Nope, just ugly pink. Plus, I've found them $5 cheaper in most places. They shipped fast if you don't care about color and price."
4,Great Recipes but Bad Binding!,"I have purchased 2 of these books: the 1st when it was first published, the 2nd a couple of years ago to replace my original worn-out copy. I love the recipes in this book! I had used it so much that the pages were falling out of my first copy, hence, why I got a newer copy. But just a couple of weeks after using this second NEW copy, the pages started falling out of the book's binding too! This is truly my only complain on this great bread-machine reference cookbook."
4,"A little dated, but an excellent bread machine book","I have several bread machine cookbooks, and this is one of the better ones. The recipe content is excellent, and the book itself arrived in excellent condition. The book itself is a little dated (I believe it was written about a decade ago), but the content is still perfectly appropriate.If you own a smaller, vertical loaf style machine, the book is spot on. A great book. If you own a larger machine (like a Zojirushi), you'll need to adapt the recipies to fit its larger loaf sizes... or use it to produce smaller loaves per the reduced ingredients listed in the book."
1,Lacking in substance,"There is nothing new in this book that other books have. I need strategies to help my child be a productive citizen, not feel guilty that he has a disability."
3,Controveral Subject,"This subject is very controveral and Dr. Block offers an excellent argument AGAINST ADHD's existence. I found it difficult to maintain interest in the book, to realistically adopt her recomendations and have not completed it."
1,Ridiculously biased and transparent,"Unlike 90% of those that have reviewed this book, I have actually read it! I will not write a bought-and-paid-for glowing review stating how brilliant this author is to exposing the ""evil"" psychiatrists and their crusade to ""manufacture"" various conditions for their own advancement and that of the pharmaceutical industry. It is absolute garbage and, unfortunately, paints psychiatrists in a poor light.If you are fascinated by Scientology and believe that those that practice psychology are evil, fine, purchase this book and read it as you sit upon your organic toilet."
5,a must read for anyone who has children in their lives,"This book gives alternatives to the drugs that doctors are so quick to pass out to our children. Everybody knows that drugs have side effects, especially with children. Dr. Block offers easy alternatives that can drastically improve your child's life and yours. I have passed this book on to many of my friends who have children who have had problems. Some are just starting to have problems, and have been ecstatic to nip the problem in the bud and be able to help their child without having to put prescription drugs into their systems. Others are at their wits ends and have been to many doctors and feel like they have tried everything with no solution. They have read this book and instantly have had hope, and once used Dr. Blocks remedies on their children, they were happy the fight was over to find a way for their children to finally feel better. i highly recomend this book to anyone who cares about a child."
4,Work very well,These work very well. They are decent quality. I'm happy I bought them. Try not to overdo it when you use them!
3,careful,wrecked my hair once with these things a few years ago. use in moderation. maybe i didn't know what i was doing though.
4,Delightful,"This book is a wonderful introduction to both Grant and Twain and their works. The story clarifies the not intimate - but respectful - relationship of these two men and shows how even though their interactions were subtle, they exerted great positive influence on one another's life and place in history."
3,nothing special,will do what they were intended to should of looked for don't think there are enough different sizesn this package
1,ok-not what expected,"this item was not what was expected, searched for Torx Sockets and got this, works, but not what was wanted"
3,Not what I needed,"I thought I was ordering torx bit set that have the hole in the end of the bit for the vandel proof type bolts. This set is a standard torx bit set and not what I needed. However, Amazon refunded my money with no questions asked. I would suggest that DeWalt or Amazon clearly indicate that this is a std set with either better photos or verbage in the description."
2,"Pelican Quality, convertable to backpack. Holds D50 and 3 lenses+ gear","You can't be all things to all people. And this bag tries hard. Shoulder bag and also a backpack, it is the swiss army knife of bags. Nicely laid out camera area with lots of padding and compartment separators. Easily holds a Nikon D50, an 18-200, 50mm, 10-20mm and my 170-500 with room for an SB800 flash. The two expandable compartments on either side are wonderful for lightweight clothing and such.Pelican products are TOP NOTCH. The 5 year warranty is nice."
3,There are better,"This barely fits a 1550 and if you have it packed too tightly it won't fit at all. Its basically an expensive shoulder bag and you're probably better off buying a Domke, Crumpler or Lowepro. I mean the whole idea is you want to load it up and then put it in the pelican case but that's not a go if you have any of the side pockets filled."
1,EXP Power SYNC v USB Cable,I never could get it to work with my computer running Vista. It was a waist of money.EXP Power Sync V USB Sync Cable & Charger for Palm V
4,A True Rock & roll classic,"This is the album that put Bruce on the rock and roll map--and deservedly so. In its newly remastered version, it's a sonic wonder. And the 1975 concert DVD sounds superb, too!Great package, albeit with a few minor drawbacks. The concert footage, with a set list similar to the historic ten Bottom Line shows in NYC, is a bit on the dark side. No one had the forethought about future formats to properly light it. And the booklet included is not very special with some unspectacular photos and an essay taken from a book that's been around for a while.Aside from that the music is still as fresh as it was 30 years and proves why Springsteen grew to be the rock and roll icon he is today and among the top echelon of rock's greatest artists.."
5,Classic Bruce,The live concert DVD included with this box set is reason enough to buy the box set. Classic Bruce from the 70's. This really is a must have for any true Bruce fan. The second DVD is a narrated by Bruce and is retrospective on the Born to Run recording sessions and his early days in Asbury Park.
1,"THE DVD IS BAD, AS IN NOT WORTH WATCHING !!!!!","I READ ALL THE REVIEWS ABOUT THIS BOXED SET AND NOBODY EVER SAID THAT THE DVD IS SO DARK THAT MOST OF THE TIME YOU SEE A OUTLINE OF BRUCE ONLY. I DON'T CARE IF THIS IS A PIECE OF HISTORY, IF YOU CAN'T SEE THE MAIN PERFORMER THEN WHY WASTE THE SPACE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!THE ONLY PERSON THAT YOU CAN SEE GOOD IS THE SAX PLAYER BECAUSE HE'S WEARING A WHITE SUIT AND ONCE IN A WHILE THEY PUT A WHITE SPOT ON HIM. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY THE OTHER DVD'S......................"
2,3 cds to Bruce????,"here is all you need from Bruce....Born 2 Run, Murder Inc, Born in USA, I'm on Fire, Glory Days, Dancin in the Dark, Philadelphia...there may be a few others, But c'mon, 3 Discs?????This is for die hards only...."
3,CD remastering could be much better,"First, let me state that I'm not that big a Springsteen fan, and that I bought the collection for my wife. The added material in the package is great and lends tons of information to the casual fan. But after listening to all the hard work that went into the album on the ""making of"" DVD, I was HIGHLY disappointed in the remastering job. Extremely flat and lifeless. I understand that we're talking about an old recording, but give me a break! Listen to ""Lazy"" on the 25th aniversary Deep Purple ""Machine Head"" CD if you want to hear excellent remastering. Or the Beatles ""One"" CD. I could go on with tons more examples. I wanted to be blown away by the disc, but can't say I have been. Great for people who have to have everything, but don't buy it for the remaster."
4,Put The Concert DVD on CD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Reviewer N.S.R. is right on the money. The remastered CD is a not as good as I thought it would be. The DVD is AWESOME!!!!!It is well worth the $23.99 I paid today at Target, hell I would of paid $100 for the DVD. But instead of including the making of the CD, why not add the Odeon concert on CD to the package. I think MOST PEOPLE WOULD HAVE WANTED THAT!!!!!! Is it me? You would think somebody at the record company would have thought of that.........."
3,"Good, not great",Definitely expecting more but overall worth the price and has a lot of great material. Definitely a must by for any fan that doesn't already own a collection package.
1,Does not play,I ordered this twice and both copies the second disc would not play. I returned both. i have not received my credit back yet.
5,Amazing!,"Everybody mentions the album and the 1975 concert.Those are both amazing, but the real surprise for me was the 1973 concert that is included on the ""Wings for Wheels"" DVD. The three songs are ""Spirit of the Night"", ""Wild Billy's Circus Story"", and ""Thundercrack"" - all three of which are amazing performances.I love this cd/dvd set and would recommend it to any fan."
4,For real fans,"As a big fan of Bruce this collector-item is ""must have"".It's a nice concert, but the sound (voice) is far away from the extreme high level of the 1975-1985 concert. Anyway, it's nice to have on DVD a concert of his starting years, 33 years ago.BTR is (one of) the best LPs/CDs of Bruce, and it's nicely put on a ""small LP lookalike"" CD.Besides, with the so devaluated dollar, it was quite cheap for my few european euros."
1,"Great record, horrible sound","I am not really a hifi-enthusiast, but there certainly is something wrong with the compression on this remaster.The harmonica in the opening is screeching. And the Boss is hissing all his s'es. I get a headache from listening to the entire record.I thought it was just the way the record sounded originally until I got hold of a second hand copy of the album. The sound on the old cd is so much better. You can distinguish the instruments and Springsteen does not sound like a ssssssnake.If you mess with old music, please make it sound better - not worse!"
5,"My nephew Alex loves this album (this is his review, actually)","According to my 7 year old nephew ""I think that the publishers of this package should make other 30th editions for other albums of Bruce Springsteens. I like the DVD's a lot. I also like how they took the ""Born To Run"" CD and made it look like a vinyl record. My favorite song is 10th Avenue freeze-out. I'm glad my aunt Libby bought this for me."""
2,Little disappointment,The cd is 5 stars.The concert dvd is 3 stars: good but not as the great Bruce Springsteen's standard.The documentary dvd is 1 star because of one reason: this edition doesn't have subtitles for not english language people. I think it's a shame to Sony-BMG
4,8x Loupe,This is perfect for analyzing 35mm slides also looking at photographs for editing and touchup photographs. The unit has a neck strap to carry with you wherever you go.
5,Like it a lot,Just what I expected and have enjoyed it very much. When can I expect the 2nd and third seasons of Maverick starring James Garner ?
3,I expected more,"I have now watched about half of the episodes. I am not sure if I watch the rest. This is not a poor series, but could be a lot of better. The quality of my DVD is not very good compared to many other shows I own. This is a big minus for me. It is a bit tireing to watch stagecoach rocking similar ways in each episode. These are obviously made in studio. Both main actors are likable, but I do not care about the Laredo-type bantering they have in each episode. If you like this, then the series is easier to like. The stories are O.K., but because of the light attitude between main actors, real excitement is lacking. Overland Trail is not a very serious business. Maybe it would have been better with a lot more comedy. Or a bit more tragedy. This is not nearly in the class of Gunsmoke, Have Gun or even Tate."
5,WHY NOT?,"In my second year of clarinet playing, I decided to get a better reed the rico, I tryed vandoren because it seemed to be the most popular (and quite frankly the most expensive) reeds, Then i tryed this reed. I was blown away at how much better these sounded, it was way easiyer to hit higher and lower nots from other reeds because the reed vibrates more freely, thus you dont need to bit down as hard and your lower lip will thank you (I once bit through my lip trying to squeak out an upper g)and you can play longer, I dont see why most people use these verses vandoren, these are less expensive and sound way better and are easyer to play on. unfortunatly I have resently started ply tenor sax on the side and mitchel lurie dosent make sax reeds, I just wish they made sax reeds too, anyway, totally worth it! and they dont crack as easily as rico do :)"
4,Good price for a good product,"I teach band and I order these for my students all the time. They respond well in the upper register and seem to last longer than the traditional Rico, or Rico Royal reeds. There are better products out there (Vandoren) but for the money and consistency, these are hard to beat."
1,Don't even think about buying this muck!,"This series of ESL textbooks and workbooks published by ALCC are of the lowest quality you could possibly find. I don't see why anyone who is not currently attending their ESL factory, oops, I mean school, would ever wish to buy it. The books are repetitive, puerile, unorganized, and linguistically unsound, not to mention chock full of all kinds of errors (typos, grammatical....)This is characteristic of the man whose name appears on the cover as ""author."" It is impossible to learn anything from studying from one of their books, and teaching from them is pure torture as well. I speak from experience.STEER CLEAR."
2,Lost data,Drive does not do well with large data files. I lost several hours of work because of this... Needs an external power supply to work well.
3,watch out for false reviwes,I was looking for hard drives and reading all the reviews and sometimes it is pretty obviouse the the reviews are faked. so it is hard to tell which review is actually honest. but if you click at the other reviews from these people you can see if they have tones of 5 star ratings for several equal products.
4,Calvary 500 GB usb/firewire drive,"Been reading the mixed reviews. I bought mine almost 8 months ago just for music files. It has been turned on since then. After reading all of the reviews, I decided to pull mine apart to see who makes the drive. It was a western Digital. Yes, the fan is a little noisy and the case does warm up a lot when I'm accessing my music files but haven't had a problem with it. I've used western digital drives for years. Mine came with the power adapter and connecting cables. The blue light on the front is too bright for me so I put a piece of tape over it. I would buy another one and have seen them as low as 80 bucks for the one I paid 119 for less than a year ago."
5,Can Be Taken Anywhere!,"This product is small, lightweight, and portable. I take it everywhere with me- in my purse, bag, or pocket. It has a sturdy casing so it won't get smashed."
5,Awesome,"Fast delivery, great product. Low price for a large amount of storage space. My friend bought the same one and neither of us have had a problem yet. Take advantage of this deal."
5,I LOVE it!,"It's portable, lightweight, and has a nice hard drive size. It works fast and doesn't act up. I'm very happy with all the items I buy from Amazon."
1,Still Waiting,"The item I received was packed well, shipped quickley, but did notwork at all when hooked up. The real test will be to see howpromptly the exchanging of the defective item is done."
3,Not as good as her memoirs,"I love this author, but I was a bit disappointed with this one. Her main characters came across the page to me as being very shallow. There are great one-liners in this book. Many times there are references to wonderfully thought-provoking situations worded in a way that makes one think about the world a bit differently. It's worth the read, but not one of my favorites."
4,At the heart of it,"May Sarton knows how to get to the heart of any relationship, and build the layers in a way that makes the characters so true to life. And this is not my favorite of her novels.PC"
2,Didn't Kill weeds but sure made the grass grow!,"I purchased this item to kill weeds in my lawn. It didn't kill the weeds, but it sure did fertilize the lawn."
1,avoid this awful sounding reissue-go for rca cd or lp,"This is a wonderful album which brings back a flood of memories of the 30+ years of Christmases our family played the Firestone lp.But don't buy this wretched sounding reissue.It has obviously been dubbed from an old lp (just listen to""It Came Upon A midnight Clear"" and hear the same vinyl flaw bumbing away as the ancient firestone lp had).It otherwise sounds scrawny and bassless.The RCA cd is better;heck,the Firestone lp I found at a used record shop a few years ago is much better. AVOID!!(This review was for a Julie Andrews cd entitled ""Joy To the world"" on a Hallmark-UK cd reissue,NOT the Robert Shaw album.Millard Henry Yates,May 2011)"
1,Terible,Guess I must have gotten a bad pack or something..I've used several brands over the years..I use these things on a daily basis and I have to say these are probably some of the worst bits I've gotten my hands on in years..I can only drive one or two screws in before these things are no good..Not sure why the other reviewers loved these and mine were horrible..
4,good value,handy case; I toss this in my drill box so I'm never without a bit! It beats the Altoids box I used to use.
2,Don't use them in an impact gun!!,I bought a pack of these after my Bosch Titanium bits finally wore out -boy was I disappointed - I drive screws all day long and I use the great Makita Li-Ion 18 impact gun - these bits are continually snapping and breaking leaving their schrapnel wedged in the screwhead....If you do screws for a living like I do-invest in the titaniums from Bosch - they last a longggg time.
5,great holiday dvd,This is a great holiday dvd. Looks like everyone is having fun and they are all great entertainers. Great hd quality.
3,Ho Ho Ho,Had fun with this concert...BUT you have to be a big Brian Setzer fan. I thought it was going to have other artist in the mix. Still had holiday spark!
4,Hot Dang!,"Something that's been around for 500 years couldn't be that bad - and the Vienna Boys Choir is no exception. These boys can sing!Their performance of selections from Mozart's Requiem, the Ave Maria, and Handel's Messiah are all spectacular. Boys' voices add a certain extra degree of authenticity not provided by women's voices. It makes it sound a little more like it did when Mozart or Handel wrote it (or at least I think it does - it's not like I was there).I'm not a huge choral fan but I did enjoy this CD. If you enjoy choral music, definitely acquire this disc. If you tolerate choral music or classical music, give this one a try. If you like neither choral music nor classical music, what are you doing in the classical music section?"
4,Great for learning Spanish,"This is a shortened version of a fun, Spanish telenovela, which follows the myriad love triangles of a group of fairly wealthy Venezuelan teenagers at a school for the arts. You have bullies, mean girls, jocks, musicians, comedians, nice kids, all the stereotypes. It's really good for practicing Spanish, because they repeat the same things over and over again. The Venezuelan accent was a little hard for me to understand at first, but I quickly got used to it. Yes, the story is silly, but it's very entertaining, and the musical numbers are well done. The cast is very attractive, they wear nice outfits, and the whole thing is very sweet. The funniest part is that the adults are portrayed as much dumber than the kids."
1,Sad,"I love this series but it was sooo shortened out. Good quality though. But seriously dont buy it thinking its the whole series because it isnt, its just a summary. It almost doesnt make sense when you watch it for the first time,"
4,Criminally Unnoticed Talent,"It's a terrible shame that the works of songstress Shiina Ringo and her new band are completely ignored by rock audiences outside of Japan. ""Kyoiku"" is one of the best albums I've heard all year. With the exception of one somewhat awkward English language piece (for which I left off a star), it's a classic straight through. If it weren't for the language barrier, Ms. Ringo would be the world's next PJ Harvey or Bjork. Hopefully someday this talent will get the attention it deserves."
4,Why only four starts? x__x;;,"I've only heard Ekimae, and I thought that song is an extremely good song. Haha.I only gave it four stars, because I've only heard Ekimae. (Duh. :P) So, yeah. If it was just the song I would rate it 5/5. :)And I guess this band isn't that... famous. Hmm."
5,The Most Extraordinary Literary Biography I've Ever Read!,"This is an astonishing book. It reads like fiction but Burroughs life was all too real. I can't imagine many writers living a life like this and actually having time to write! It's also a very perceptive book about the circle of friends (Including Jack Kerouac, Brion Gysin, the Poet Allan Ginsburg, Burroughs' wife Joan Burroughs and her their friend Herbert Huncke). I've never read a more interesting biography. This is Ted Morgan's masterpiece. Too bad his book on F.D.R is such a tiresome retread. With this cast, it could hardly have been better.Literary Outlaw: The Life and Times of William S. Burroughs"
4,Fast and fun,"For the uninitiated, the Toby Peters mysteries are a fun romp through 1940s Hollywood. Peters is a down-on-his-luck private detective who is hired by famous folks of the forties to help them. A great cast of supporting characters usually helps him along. This book is a perfect example of a Toby Peters mystery. In this novel, he's got to protect Charlie Chaplin from someone who's threatening to kill him. As others have said, it's a little darker in tone, but there are still plenty of funny lines. Again, the comical supporting characters are around, and again, Kaminsky allows them to be funny, while rarely getting carried away (y'know, to the point of goofiness). Kaminsky is obviously much smitten with Hollywood, and he brings this love to his books. A very quick and enjoyable read."
3,"I enjoyed it, but.........","The 4 year hiatus that Kaminsky took between Fatal Glass of Beer and this one seems to have dampened his enthusiasm for Toby Peters. While the book was enjoyable it seemed to ""cut to the chase"" more quickly than before. Also, the characters seemed to lose their ""lightheartedness"" over the past 4 years. This one seemed much ""darker"" than the previous 20. I do hope the series continues and reader don't have to wait as long for the next one, but Kaminsky needs get back on track and return to his breezy, uninhibited style and lose the somber overtones."
2,Average at Best,"A very ordinary mystery. It seemed the client (Charlie Chaplin) did a lot of the work for the detective that he hired. Toby Peters is average at best and appeared to be too obtuse to be a Private Eye. The book was not fast paced,or even terribly exciting. It barely held my interest to the find out who did it or why. For this author, whose works I have read in the past, this is poor. Find another of his work. MOst are much much better"
5,John P. Cutler,This is a great CD to get if You're new to the Vienna Boys Choir. It has Strauss waltzes and other music You'll enjoy.As usual the Vienna Boys Choir did an outstanding job.
4,GOOD ORODUCT!,"THIS WORKED OUT WELL FOR OUR NEEDS, WAS DURABLE ENOUGH TO STAND UP TO BEING MOVED AROUND SOME AND TO A LITTLE WIND FROM THE HVAC IN THE BUILDING SO IT DID IT'S JOB."
2,paper damaged,The roll of paper that I recieved had what appeares to be 3 roller marks down the paper. I am trying to get it replaced but Adorama is not willing to help out because the order is more then 14 days old. I was not informed to inspect the product on arrival to insure a 14 day turn aroundf on issues.
2,"QUALITY AND PRICE GOOD, BUT COLOR DESCRIPTION IS A BIT OFF","THE PRODUCT IS GREAT, AND WORKS PERFECT FOR WHAT ITS DESIGNED TO DO. AS OTHERS HAVE STATED YOU DO LOOSE A LITTLE PAPER RIGHT OFF THE BAT DUE TO PACKAGING. THE PRICE IS GREAT, AND THE SHIPPING WAS QUICK. THE ONLY DOWNSIDE IS THE COLOR IS CERTAINLY AN ""OFF"" WHITE. IF YOU WANT A PURE WHITE BACKDROP THIS IS NOT FOR YOU. PICTURES CAN BE EDITED TO BE MORE WHITE, BUT OBVIOUSLY WHEN YOU BUY AN ITEM LIKE THIS YOU'RE BUYING IT SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO PHOTOSHOP THE BACKGROUND. IT WOULD BE WISE OF THEM TO REPHRASE THE TITLE TO STATE OFF WHITE, AND CHANGE THE PICTURE TO BETTER CLRAIFY THE COLOR."
2,Not worth it,"This is basically a 9 foot wide tube of off white light weight construction paper. As someone else pointed out, if it tears or gets marked up, you just cut off the bottom and unroll some more. Unfortunately, due to the poor packing job by the shipper, I lost about 4 feet right off the bat due to tears. Oh, and good luck rolling it back up and putting it in the tube for storage......."
3,Not Completely Satisfied,"The front face of the door is a thin plastic that is spaced away from the 'meat' of the door and creates an air pocket. It's like a cheap drum. The sticker was placed right on it and it leaves sticky material that you need to work really hard to clean off right away... And the thin material scares me to death to clean, I left a mark on it the first hour I had it. We did not account for the 2.5""-3"" AC plug that it comes with. It leaves our unit hanging out a bit at this time. I need to find a 90 degree low profile plug or the likes.This unit relaced our 22 year old JCPenney model. I'm not so sure they make things like they use to."
5,Great Microwave.,"This was a replacement for my old Sharp unit. I made a good buy, Partly based on the reviews of others."
5,Sharp Microwave R-420LK,Ordered Sharp Microwave R-420LK to fit a built-in cabinet microwave opening. Fit perfectly. Was packaged well for a safe delivery. Shipping and delivery was prompt. Microwave features were as advertised. I am very satisfied with the product and Amazon's price.
5,Sharp microwave is SHARP,We have had this oven for a while now and I just discovered this ratig system. We have had no problems whatsoever and use it quite a bit. Would recommend to others. Great for the price.
3,Mixed review,"Although the microwave works well, the sticker applied to the door was IMPOSSIBLE to remove and has left a permanent mark which is very disappointing."
5,Great fun,Great fun and very unusual for a different puzzle.good for old and young. Gives you hours of entertainment and fun
5,Bought for Christmas gift for a puzzle queen,"Bought this gift for my mom who does puzzles constantly. She said it was quite a challenge to complete, all the pieces are the exact same shape which makes it very hard to complete using colors alone. She had to resort to the numbers on the back of the pieces to complete it. However in the end, it was very neat looking and now is displayed on a shelf in her home."
4,good stuff,because it's meant to large variety of sanders they don't fit perfectly. othervise good sandpaper.
5,Obscure Heavy Seventies Classic!,"Reminiscent of early DEEP PURPLE, (due to driving keyboards and guitars and a Rod Evans-like lead vocals,) but (only marginally,) less of a hippy, 60s vibe. Some great fuzzed-out guitar work and a heap of great riffs. Upbeat, accessible, hard rock from '71.Well worth the asking price in the ""New & Used"" section!"
2,Model with some quality problems,"I bought this model for my son's second model building experience. Unfortunately, there were a few quality problems which prevented him from enjoying the model as much as he could. Three pieces were not fully formed (one was a main body section but we managed to hide the short material) and the weapons bay door was warped and needed to be glued in place to keep it flush with the rest of the body. On the good side, the directions were clear and the suggestion for a camo pattern gave this plane a great look. Just a note about models of this scale (not specific to Italeri): some of the pieces are extremely small and my son has a lot of difficulty with setting some pieces in place. For younger builders, I'd recommend a model of a larger scale."
2,Only Adequate,"This case is just OK. It not particularly well-padded, but I don't abuse my iPod the way some people do. The worst part is the belt clip. It should be permanently attached to the case, but you have to snap it on. With the slightest bump, it breaks loose, so if you're going to use the clip, trust me on this one: Superglue it to the case! A LOT of Superglue!"
4,"Great, but...","These guys are awesome, this show is about one of maybe five things on TV I actually watch.The only thing that keeps me from giving this set the five stars is that the order of the episodes seems to be broken up, they refer to shows not on any set I own and seem to have skipped over others. Why Discovery can't just release their shows in seasons like normal people is beyond me.But that's just a gripe with the publishing, as for the content itself, five stars."
3,Just go get a month of netflix,Go get a month of netflix for 9 dollars a month...you can watch this mythbusters along with every other one instantly
3,"Sturdy, really good for a manual type. But remember it's not a vacuum!","Picks up a lot of stuff. Much more sturdily-built than most manual floor sweepers. Not perfect, but I also have a powered floor sweeper, and I use this one when the battery runs down on it, which has always been my complaint about that kind. Both beat dragging out the big vacuum every day get the crumbs and kitty litter that gets kicked out whenever anybody uses the box. If they would ever perfect the batteries on the cordless ones, I would be very happy, but they always seem to fail at the wrong time. This works well on low pile carpet, although it takes a bit more effort, but that is the only kind I have to test it on.I also wanted something I could use during our frequent power outages. I don't have to worry about re-charging with this."
2,Bad Purchase,The only positive thing I can say about this product is it has a sturdy build. It does not pick up very well and it is very difficult to navigate. This will be returned. Think I will try the swival sweeper.
4,Works great,"This is a good-quality sweeper. It picks up most of the crumbs, dust and all, after a few passes. I think that other reviewers may be expecting this to work more like a vacuum - it will not get every last bit, and it will take more than one pass. For quick clean-ups, it's great."
1,I Ordered this last month (Nov) and still have not received it!,I ordered this a month ago in Nove. First Amazon sent me a notice that it was going to be shipped. Then.....got another notice that it was not being shipped. I went on the web site for this product and he was IN STOCK so why has Amazon not sent it to me? I have dealt with Amazon for a long time and I am very dissapointed in the way they have handled this matter. I got it for a Christmas gift but now doubt if I will ever receive it. Boo for Amazon
1,Spend your money on something that works,"The design works in theory only. It wouldn't pick up anything on low pile carpet. I returned it and ordered a Bissel carpet sweeper, like the one I had 20 years ago and am so very glad I did. It works wonderfully and was a great deal less expensive. It just proves that new designs and being more expensive doesn't mean you are getting a better product. Amazon was great to work with on the return, no hassles."
5,Sensuous songs by Tchaikovsky,"One of the best recordings of the lesser known Tchaikovsky repertoire, his songs. Larin has a beautiful voice and sings with sensitive musicality. Just listen to ""Amid the noise of the ball"". Warmly recommended."
1,Could not get it to work ...,"I bought the Journal along with the pen and an extra notebook. The Journal software won't load on my pen. I tried taking other applications on and off the pen, and that was easy. I did not get the memory expansion module.Anyways, I cannot use this software on my pen, and so it is useless."
1,Does not work,I had bought the Fly pen during holiday sales at a discount and was excited to see what it could do. The notebooks I got worked great but the journal's software wouldn't load on the pen properly. I contacted the company about my problem and did not receive a response. I also tried to find a fix online but was unable to do so. I do not recommend.
4,Fly Fusion Journal,"This is a typical notebook, although you need it's special paper for the Fly Fusion to work. For the price it could perhaps have another hundred pages, but otherwise it's a good solid notebook. Good binding, thick cover, has the Fly Fusion controls on the cover."
3,okay book purchase,"My 2-year-old and I think this book is okay. The art work is a little hard to follow for me, although my son doesn't seem to have a hard time. He likes the poetry of it. It isn't a great potty training book, per say, but nevertheless, an okay purchase. One part I don't like is pushing the standing up to pee for boys, I prefer to start him out sitting and progress to that once the actual going in the potty 100% of the time is established."
3,Don't like the wording,"My son likes this book, but I change the wording for two pages. It says, ""boys can stand, girls should sit."" For one thing my son can't stand yet, he's is mastering just knowing when to go and the ""girls should"" part bugs me. The pictures aren't very engaging; it was an okay book, not my favorite."
3,Time to Pee!,"We love Mo Willems, so I was really excited to buy a potty training book from her series. We were a little disappointed with the content...its a little confusing. It probably would have been better if she made two gender appropriate books as opposed to just one book. However, the sticker chart that is included inside the cover was a big plus. My daughter really looked forward to placing stickers on it each time she used the restroom. If nothing else it was great for the positive reinforcement factor....if you are a little bit crafty, you could probably make your own sticker chart at home and skip the book entirely."
5,Great Book for Toddlers' potty training,"My daughter loves this book, she loves all the cute illustrations. Mo Willems is a great author, my daughter loves all his books."
2,Too much of the illustrations are devoted to words!,"At the age you potty train (2-3) the kids really respond to simple humor and interesting pictures. My one big problem with this book is that about 75% of each illustration is devoted to presenting each individual word of prose on the page. Even with the humor, there wasnt enough pictoral depiction of the sequence of sensing and doing the business! Not many kids this age are really going to focus on each word in the caption so I think the illustration allocation is totally off."
2,My daugher was unimpressed,"I purchased this book for my 3year old daughter, who can go to the bathroom on her own, but needs reminders. I thought I could use the iconic ""mouse"" in the book as a connection for her to remember to go. (The mice hold up signs.)She not only didn't get the ""ah hah"" message, she is not at all interested in the book. She loved Mo Willems other stories and she showed interest in other ""potty"" training books that I bought her, but this one was a zero for her. Oh well, now that I bought it I'll keep reading it periodically to see if it helps. Be sure to get a good price if you are thinking of buying this one."
4,As Good A Leadbelly Comp Out There....Maybe The Best...,"....but wonder why it's so difficult to track down his version of ""Cotton Fields""? There are duplicates here, but second versions may have backing by the Golden Gate Jubilee Quartet, Sonny Terry..but there's still room here for a few more of his famous songs. Best compilation of his stuff (esp. for the price) so far, though."
3,good music but faulty cds,"The music is as advertised, classis Leadbelly. But some of the CDs jump or skip when played, and don't seem to indicate an end when it is over, leaving the CD rattling in the player."
4,Great book for a report!,"This book helped my kid's report on Old Man of the Mountain.Lots of interesting history, on who owned it, when, lots of good interesting (to me!) details. It was written in 1980, so the history stops there..."
3,Nice Charger,"On the surface, this charger appears to be nicely made and convenient for auto use, just a bit pricey. Unfortunately and do to design, the charing unit does not securely hold the battery inplace. I've found that the battery slips out too easly, and can and does get ejected out of the charger if you hit a firm bump on the road. It's something you will want to keep an eye one. Got to where I needed the camera today, and again I found the battery on the floor of my truck."
1,Save your money,Just get a power inverter (~35-45$) and use the included battery charger. Then you can also use the inverter to power a laptop or a drill or something useful.
2,The Useless Gadget Cabinet Gets a New Addition,"The concept of this gizmo is cool, I admit. Once I got it, I was disappointed in the size for one. It says you can make salsa in it....sure...for one person (maybe). It's not a time saver if it doesn't chop the herbs, and then u have to clean the lil bugger. I've gone back to using my trusty cutlery."
2,defective,"Buy 3 units of this product, a defective came because the acoble not assure, and release the attachment to the screw tip or countersink. It does not work well."
4,Computational and Theoretical Aerodynamics,This book is very important for understanding key aerodynamic concepts. I feel that this book must be used in conjunction with 'Bases of Aerodynamic Design' by Kuethe and Chow.
2,"Overly complex, confusing, and wordy","In my senior year as a mechanical engineering student and this book makes it on my list of worst texts I have ever read. The material this book is teaching is complicated, which means the authors should have taken extra care to break things down slowly and concisely. What they did was just the opposite. The book if full of complicated math with little explanation, and irrelevant assumptions with too much explanation."
3,Incomplete,"Let me jump straight to chapter 8, if you never read Modern Compressible Flow by Anderson, which is the textbook that my school uses for Gas Dynamics course, then you won't be able to do some of the problems given in this particular chapter, such as problem 8.18 (reflected shock, which isn't covered/is barely covered by the authors). If you plan to use this book for introduction to compressible flow or Gas Dynamics, stay away & stick to Anderson's book that I mentioned earlier (after you've read that book, then go ahead & read this book). It is not a bad book overall, but it cannot be used by itself. If you want a decent aerodynamics textbook/reference, then go with another Anderson's excellent book called Fundamentals of Aerodynamics. However, you shouldn't stick with just one book, build your library because some books have their pros and cons."
5,History comes alive in this double program,"Joan Sutherland at age 37; a wonderful experience. It makes me wish I were old enough to have seen her live. The DVD has two programs -- one from 1963 is in Black and White. The one from 1969 is in color. Both were broadcast on CBC television. The quality is excellent. The sound, though monophonic, is clear with a nice frequency range. The visual elements of the 1963 program are a bit soft, but clear. There is no blurring as I have seen from other broadcasts from that period. The 1963 program is a bit choppy as if some elements were lost. It took two viewings to understand what they were trying to do. Regardless of these imperfections the two programs were wonderful. To see and hear Ms Sutherland at this point in her career was a treat."
5,A Far Better Basis,Christianity isn't about our achievement of holy living or loving people more that we might be loved by God. Christianity is about finding the love of God in Christ through the miracle of redemption and letting that love transform us from the inside out. Mildred Bangs Wynkoop was one of the most outstanding theologians of the holiness tradition who sets right the way of Christ which most Christians can not or will not follow. Read it to understand a picture of Christianity that is only rarely seen.
4,antec pro 120mm dbb,This fan arrived in a timely fashion and fits my needs. The fan does not seem too loud and appears to cool my computer fine. Hope it lasts :)The reason i did not give a full 5 stars is because these could always be more silent.
2,The Fat Free Junk Food Cookbook,"I am really glad that I first checked out this book at the library--like other reviewers said, it has no nutritional info, thus cooks have no idea what the calorie count, transfat, carbs, etc., are. For $15.00, this small cookbook has little info and no photos. I would not invest in this bookThe Fat-free Junk Food Cookbook: 100 Recipes of Guilt-Free Decadence; I suggest you buy something else. With this book, your food may be fat-free, but YOU will not be!"
5,Good stuff!,"Having one of those quick breads for breakfast.Would rate this book 10+. Was worried its one of those books where you got to use ""half of fat free jello"" or splenda. Well its not that kind of book.There are actually real ingredients and tons of good ideas.Also it doesnt say anything about nutrition,so why expect it? It said ""fat free"" and all those delicious recipes are fat free.So you get what you paid for. Which i believe is a reasonable price. Awesome cook book."
3,wears out quickly,"this is a cute toy but its fabric is not very durable. its construction is not very durable either. for example, the little tow anchor thingy came unsewn in about a day and then i had to resew it myself. the material is like felt on some parts and gets little balls of lint/fuzz. whenever i received it in the mail, it was already worn looking but the retailer assured me this was normal?? sigh."
3,Useful for the ryobi sander,Not special but gets the job done without excessive cost. A greater variety of sand weights would be desirable for customers.
2,Total Ripoff,"To have to pay $1.00 per sheet is outrageous.I've been in metal work and wood work for over 40 years and except for this size, I can get 50 sheets for under $20.What gives?"
4,Excellent Christmas story,Mr. Christmas is an excellent Christmas family movie. It shares with the viewer a simpler time in our history that is both honest and heartwarming.
2,"Nice story, painful acting","This story, with its nostalgia-evoking setting and charming premise, could make a holiday staple, but the level of acting will not allow that. To be sure, there is a valid point in the assertion of the ""A for Effort"" reviewer, but on the other hand, no amount of allowance for production constraints can gloss over the reality that the actors cannot convince the viewer of anything more than the fact that they are reciting their lines.It's a nice story and the costumes and sets are commendable, but it can't sincerely deliver its message when the acting leaves the characters devoid of authenticity."
3,This movie rocks,This movie is really enjoyable. Children will definitely love this movie. It is fully entertaining and a family movie.
1,waste of money,I really hated this movie regretted even buying it. I didn't feel that it was authentic to the period at all. I also thought it looked more like local play instead of a movie!!! Don't waste your time and money
3,Mr. Christmas,"Although this was a sweet story and the children were wonderful, the adult actors were stilted and wooden in their acting."
5,Best Bag I've Owned!,I can't begin to tell you what a great bag this is. I must have tried most on the market. I like it better then my rolling bags.The only suggestion I would make is to include a shoulder strap--I went out and bought one of my own which further enhaced the functionality of the bag.
5,Best ever!,"You can buy all three of Vicki's ablums, play them in order, over and over and never regret a second of it. Very gifted person! My whole family likes it and so do the kids at school. It's hard to please everyone but this album foots the bill!"
4,Comments on Theophany,"Honestly, time will tell with this one. Perhaps someday in the future it will be generally agreed that this is a kitschy composition. I've been listening to it every so often ever since this CD came out a few years ago, though, and it remains one of my favorites by Tavener (and I've collected about 20 CDs with his music). Comment for Beatles fans: Tavener was an ""Apple Corps"" artist (The Whale). At the end of ""Theophany"" there is a buildup to a catastrophe of sound and then a long falling-away. See if it doesn't remind you of the end of ""A Day in the Life."""
1,only for beginners,"This book offers very little hard data for anyone serious about training. It's OK for someone that knows little and is just getting started, but how many people spend $100 for a HR monitor and the book and aren't serious? It offers no workout training schedules, no max heart rate testing, and no sport specific information. It doesn't even use resting heart rate to calculate training zones. I got the feeling that most case studies were on friends and neighbors. No research articles are cited. No alternate viewponts were offered. Even simple concepts such as taking your resting heart rate in the morning are not elaborated on (HOW do you take it in the morning - do you wear your HR monitor all night? Manually count it? It's not as simple as it seems.)It's very friendly and folksey, and would be an OK book to give to your sedendary mother, but isn't for the more serious minded exercizer."
2,Water Filters Float,"I ordered these filters and the description was for 10-12 cup Kitchenaid coffee maker. They send the 10 cup filters and I have a 12 cup coffee maker. I didn't think this should make any difference since the filter fit just fine, but when I put 8 cups of water in the coffee maker the filter floats and I cannot figure out how to make it stay in place."
1,Don't Bother - Junk,"We tried three of these over the past year - one failed within a month, (the monitor) and the other two monitors failed within four months. The craftsmanship is terrible and not worth the money or the bother.The company is difficult to deal with also - hard to get replacement parts without an extraordinary amount of hassle. And I mean extraordinary.It also has a lot of interference with phones and microwaves(both old and new). However, that fault was livable if it would have continued working.After getting completely frustrated, we switched to a different company (Summer Infant with flat screen monitor) and are completely happy...works great with absolutely no interference from anything in our home."
1,Commenter's need some professionalism.,"Though the Doctor's scientific commentaries are quite outstanding and his rants on religion are just that, his commentators leave something to be desired. Most are anti-religious babble that are wrong 90% of the time and seem more anti-catholic than anything else. But there is the irony. If the commentators commented moreon the science and dialogue more, this blog would be much more professional science."
5,Review from the Publisher,"Devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus according to St. Gertrude. Our Lord chose St. Gertrude to be the Messenger or Herald of Divine Love, and He guided her as she wrote, so that through her He might make known the secrets of His Heart, and thus draw many hearts to Himself. Jesus said to St. Gertrude, ""I wish your writings to be for later times a proof of the tenderness of My Heart, and I will make them a source of grace to many souls. While you write, I will keep your heart near to My Heart, and will instill into it, drop by drop, what you are to say."" By following these actual words of Our Lord to St. Gertrude in our daily life, a soul will become enriched with incomparable merit, and will be filled, even in this life, with the profound peace and joy which come from loving the Sacred Heart of Jesus. 203pp. PB. Imprimatur."
5,Works great,Love the idea of not opening and closing. One tool in one easy to use and you are able to work faster
2,Unlocks after drilling,"I bought the first one a few years ago. It worked fine but after some time the insert unit unlocked and stayed in the board after drilling a hole.I thought that the locking mechanism was worn out so I bought a new one earlier this year. I hadn't used this new one many times when the same problem appeared so I returned it and got a refund. I haven't quite figured out how the locking mechanism works. The tool is super when it does work as intended, but I dare not try a third one."
5,Best!!!,This is my 2nd one. My first one last more than 4 years. I bought something similar and it was terrible. I will never boy others kind. I love this product very much...
5,A Very Useful Accessory for my DeWalt Cordless Drill,I purchased this Flip Drive unit to complete the tasks of installing door hinges on new doors. Drilling pilot holes is a necessary chore to ensure that there are no cracks or chips in the wood. I was impressed with the way in which this tool allowed me to convert from drilling to driving screws without having to sort through drill bits or screw driving bits. All I needed was right there in my cordless drill. I like tools that work for me; this is such a tool.
1,VERY POOR EXECUTION,"Good idea, bad execution. I have used bits like this, from many manufacturers, since their inception as a contractor. These bits took a HUGE step up when the countersinks came equipped with four wings (cutters) instead of two.This bit is manufactured in typical DeWalt fashion: looks good, works good for a couple of cuts, then it breaks. I have taken broken bits back to the local DeWalt service center only to have them tell me that I'm the only person who ever brings these back broken. B******t!!!Do yourself a favor, buy a similar product that IS NOT yellow in color. It will last much, much longer."
3,Not that functional.,"I think it's ok, now that I have it I really don't see much use for it. I do very well with a regular bit holder. If you really want it, get it from a local hardware store, shipping cost just as much as the holder."
4,"DREAMS, DREAMS,DREAMS","I thought this book was rather interesting. The storyline was one that kept you guessing what really happened to Susan Trench. This was Hallie Knight's assignment. Hallie was called into play by Susan""s grandfather. After uncovering many family secrets--she solves the puzzle."
3,A Good Read,"Amethyst Dreams was a good read, but the depth of spell binding suspense left one wishing for more. Topsail was a good setting and it matched the plot. Characterization was strong, but the characters fell short of ecpectation because they were so toned down. It was like they were being held back and not allowed to go sleuthing as the plot and characterization called for, or express emotion in the true sense of the word. The ending was also subdued from what could have been a hold your breath surprise."
5,Creatively Farming With Small Plots,"This is a creative work of art, as well as a practical explanation of various methods of eco-farming. Barbara BerstAdams has a glorious ability to live close to the earth whilebeing highly articulate and spiritual. It reminds me of my childhood during the depression when we would have starved had it not been for our gardens, chickens and cows! At least we knew what real food tasted like, and when it was recommended that we not eat eggs, I never stopped eating eggs. This book is not only timely, practical and educational. It is delightfully written with the heart of a poet! You will encounter many varieties of eco-farms with interesting and successful concepts in producing and marketing on surprisingly small acreages. I loved this book!Lois Gates LenzNorman, Oklahoma"
3,I expected more.,"This book seemed to be trying to convince me to try micro-eco farming... but I was already very convinced beforehand... I wanted strategies, steps, details on how people had created their success stories. Instead I got many different examples of how people succeeded, but with too little detail on the trials and tribulations enroute. Despite great anticipation, I found I skimmed this book in record speed.So, it is great at convincing, less great at giving the first steps to start."
2,Not much practical use,"If I were an urbanite who knew nothing about gardening or nature, I suppose this could be a good inspirational book. But for someone who is seriously researching ways of ""prospering from backyard to small acreage,"" this book is virtually no help. No details...not even suggestions on what size to build raised beds. The author expounds page after page on living with nature, which I appreciate, but the philosophical underpinnings of such do not provide the logistics of making money."
5,Micro Eco-Farming,"Barbara Berst Adams has written an excellent, well written work on getting the most from gardening efforts on small acreage. Easy to read and packed with practical ideas."
3,I expected more too,It gives a true beginner some helpful insights into the different forms of micro-agriculture but it never goes into detail.
5,It's all about the possibilities!,"This is the right book, written at the right time, by the right author!Barbara is on the money--it's about exploring all the possibilities, enhancing the soil with trace minerals, learning how important innovative marketing is vs. just getting higher yield, showing that micro eco-farms are ""design-your-own."" There's not one cookie-cutter method everyone across the country can imitate (one of the main reasons small farms died out in the 80s -- everyone doing surplus of the same thing), and something needed to be written for both newbies and generational farmers looking to diversify. This is the book. It is well-researched and well-written. If you're about doing well by doing good, then this book is for you."
5,The Future Of Farming,This is a concise review of where large and small farming is going. It needs to be read by all. Just reading this book has elevated my urban garden to unbelievable heights.
3,ntsc standards,"Normally I can play NTSC tapes but this tape was obviously recorded under a different NTSC standard ... it played at high speed ... luckily my VCR has a ""Search"" function where I can regulate the speed almost to normal ... the sound was a bit funny though"
1,Total waste of money & time,"This is the worst tool I have ever bought, and I've bought hundreds. I had one of these about 15 years ago, and it was great. Hardwood top, well-designed quality parts, worked like a charm and I loved it and used it until I wore it out. But this new version? The top is made of pressed and laminated bamboo instead of hardwood, and it split the moment I attached it to the frame. Right out of the box the frame is bent, and the screw rods are bent so the clamp will not open or close as it should. I could go on and on but the bottom line is, don't waste your money or your time on this cheap Chinese-made piece of junk. If I were Black & Decker, I'd be ashamed to put my name on it much less sell it. I'm returning it as soon as I finish this review. And one last comment: if this had been made in America, it would not only have provided someone here with a job, it would probably actually work."
4,Four stars at this price.,"I purchased two of these Workmate 125 benches at a home improvement store for $20 each. (I believe they were mis-marked.) Were I to have paid full price I would have given it two or three stars. I have a workmate 225 which I use frequently and find very useful. The wm125 is lighter duty and does not have the same quality as the wm225 (the wood on the wm225 is finished slightly better, the hardware beefier and it seems to operate smoother.) Assemble took 30-45min taking my time, (I used a 1/8th inch round-over router bit to smooth the sharp edges of the wood.) I had no problems with assembly other than one bolt was missing for the leg assembly and the Black and Decker sticker on the front leg brace was out of place so I took it off. If I were only to have one Workmate I would get a 225 or 425, but as a backup or for very light duty the wm125 at this price is a great value."
1,Prices way down on B & D WM125,I posted my gripes earlier---just an update on price. Local Ace Hardware has reduced price to 14.95which is about what the unit is worth. Obviously B & D and Ace know there are some lemons WM125's) out there!
3,"Happy with the product, not the service","I got this product as a gift. My father-in-law had one and I thought it worked great for holding lumber in place while cutting and for mounting my mitre saw. He knew I liked and and thought it would be a good Xmas present since I was finishing my basement.When I recieved mine it was missing one of the plastic holders that holds my saw in place. I called B&D; to get a new one and they had a difficult time figuring out what part I needed, it only came in a set and they couldn't just send me one. Finally, I asked them to send the whole set and when it arrived it was the wrong piece. I called again and went through the whole process over again. After three calls I got the part that I needed and some extras that I didn't. At least I have some extra parts in case something breaks."
2,No locking feature,"This bench has no locking feature when upright, therefore it will easily collapse during use. i would not recommend it to others."
4,"good design, poor quality","I bought this little Workmate recently from Amazon. It's a gooddesign but the quality was lousy and maybe not what it used to be.One of the crank knobs came broken, and the general fit of the partswas poor: the lead-screws that work the clamps were too stiff, evenafter being greased; the pins that held the cranks were too big andwouldn't come close to press fitting until I squeezed them down to asmaller diameter with a vice grip; the plastic parts the front boardsits on didn't fit into the boards well and had to be pressed in witha vise; and the foot-rest leg braces needed some bending before thewhole thing would sit square.On the positive side, it's very portable and fine for light work,especially for the price."
1,Terrible Table,"I bought this today from the blue home store. I returned it today too. I had the same problems others had with parts not fitting together. The whole thing was out of whack and when I tried to bend it so the legs would all touch the ground, (I didn't get them all to touch at the same time) the table was twisted so one side was leaning. Trying to make the table straight and the legs were all out of sorts. The cross braces have two holes for bolts on each side. One fit ok. The second, one side I could only fit one bolt through. There was no way the second was going to fit unless I drilled a hole. It was about an inch off. I thought I would manage with one bolt on that side of the brace, But after getting the thing put together and not getting it to set right I returned it. No money loss, but a lot of my time. I would give it a ""0"" if I could.I really wanted the wm 425 but one wasn't available. I will wait and think about this experience before spending more time and money."
1,Poor Quality,"I bought this Workmate because I recently moved and had left my larger Workmate in storage to be picked up at later date. I needed something to work on right now. I was very disappointed with the quality of this item. Almost all the parts needed hammering, filing and bending to get them to fit. I think the thing was made from melted down Hot Wheels and old pallets. If you do buy this thing make sure you have a file and something to apply some torque to the bolts with or you'll never get it together."
1,Hard to Assemble,"The instructions were poorly written, and as others posted, holes do not line up. I wish I had never bought it."
3,workmate,This was a little flimsy and was disappointed that it was cheaper regular price at Home Depot. Very easy to put together and works ok. The rubber feet on the ends of the legs come off all the time.
4,WM125 worth the price,"I had an older Workmate that finally bit the dust after decades. This new model does the same job although the quality is not quite as good. As for initial assembly, the instuctions are pretty vague but adequate. The pre-drilled holes of the foot boards/legs did not seem to match up until I realized the footboards are different widths. I switched them around, everything matched up. All other parts went together with gentle coaxing. It's cheap steel, plastic, it's Chinese, it's what you get in this day and age for this price. By the way, the wooden table top/jaws of my old Workmate were made from some sort of pressboard which did not hold up well. This new one seems made of some form of bamboo. It will be interesting to see how long it lasts. Workmates are useful for all kinds of tasks, this model is very portable and should hold up for years."
2,Difficult setup - missing parts - OK bench,"It should not be that just b/c this is a cheap table ""you get what you paid for."" Unfortunately, this is a cheap table. The holes of the metal supports that hold the legs together (which you'll have to bolt to the legs yourself) did not line up with the holes of the legs! I had to hammer, bend them, and then reverse the direction you insert the bolts to get them in. After all was said and done, as I was installing the handles (which come in two pieces), I realized one of the handles was broken and a piece was missing.Very frustrating to say the least. I got a replacement and that one was OK. It does the job, nothing to write home to mom about."
3,Sandpaper - OK for unfinished wood,"I have a Black and Decker sander that this paper fits. Unfortunately they do not sell an open coat version of this paper. It loads up much too quickly for sanding between coats of finish. It is also partially cut thru to allow the user to make it smaller to fit various models of B&D; sanders. I have the largest sander and the ridges created by the perforations load up and sometimes curl keeping the remainder of the paper out of contact with the wood.You have no choice though, you must used their sandpaper with their sanders since nothing else fits them. I reviewed the sander separately."
3,Wears out too fast,"There are far better quality sand papers that last far longer than this one. Too expensive, considering a competitor's sandpaper will fit just fine."
4,Great to tote along,"Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase. I ordered three bags: pink, purple, and a green for myself. I am giving them as gifts for my bridesmaids. The quality and size is excellent. I was a little dissapointed with the green bag, the color is not as pictured. So I will be giving the bag to a friend and I just ordered a black one for myself. I would highly recommend these totes."
5,Great Cookware,"Have used this cookware for about a month now on conventional glass electric cooktop. Have had no issues with cleaning the stainless steel pans and the non stick frying pans are great. They brown meats very quickly and the small 8 in pan cooks great omlettes. One disappointment is that the cookware set came with a stainless 3 qt saute pan even though Henckels makes a 3 qt non stick saute pan. If ordering a not stick cookware set, would expect all pieces for which there is non stick version available to be a part of the set.The set was purchased primarily to go with an induction cooktop being installed as part of a kitchen remodel in the next month. I have used the 2 qt sauce pan on a single element induction cooktop (Max Burton 6000) and it boiled water very quickly so look forward to using the whole set on the induction cook top."
5,you took the words right outta my mouth... I can die happy too,"my thoughts exactly. I have been waiting for years to have this album re-issued. I have been bugging Jadd at Meteor City records for the past 2 years once I heard that there were rumors flying around about Lunar Womb being put out again. this was actually supposed to come out a year and a half ago. more than once, I came really close to spending a butt-load of money on over-priced used copies of the original version of Lunar Womb (on Hellhound records) on EBay. but I held out, and tried to stay patient. finally, my waiting has paid off. in the entire ""stoner-rock"" genre (God, I hate that term), this is probably one of the most important albums. a true classic from one of the greatest singer/guitarists since Hendrix, the almighty Wino. also, probably the best Obsessed album. now, the only thing left is for a label to re-issue The Church Within. I already have my copy, but there are tons of other Obsessed fans out there that need it."
1,Great title --- stop there and fill in your own story!!,"In searching for another item on Amazon this suggestion popped up, and I thought, ""Perfect! My daughter meets this description and I'd love to get the book for my husband who could use some comic relief in being primary caregiver for our two (ages 3 and 1)."" Thank goodness for ""Look Inside"" and other readers' reviews! I lost all respect for the author when I hit the introductory mention of the Nanny, and those poor souls who read the entire book affirmed my original reaction. Of course, who has time to write such a whiney tome other than a stay-at-home with enough resources to outsource their job?I also found the prolific use of profanity to be a turnoff. Truly, can the author not find other words to express herself? Thanks Amazon, and other ""Amazonian's"" for the option to ""try before you buy."""
4,Entertaining and interesting,"I found this book entertaining and fun to read. While Rebecca Eckler is (gasp!!) honest about some of the negative aspects of motherhood, she also talks about how much she loves her baby, how she's careful crossing streets now and notices every car, how she rushes her baby to the ER when the baby had a mere cold, how she throws a first birthday party for her child and lavishes it with plenty of toys. HOW AWFUL!!! I think a lot of readers attack a mother who admits to having postpartum depression and feeling tired. I hope those readers are more sympathetic to their children. What if their children are tired or sick? Will those readers beat them and accuse them of being selfish?If you enjoyed her last book, and you don't want to stone mothers who admit to feelings of inadequacy and tiredness, you will probably enjoy this one.I also got a lot of practical advice from the book, such as when babies teethe, are ready for solid food, etc."
1,Don't waste your money...,"Not a good book. Not a funny book. It's an expletive-riddled story written by a self-centered, abrasive, irritating, whiny, egomaniac who is impossible to connect with. How many of us have nannies, can spend $5000 on our child's first birthday party, keep a second apartment in another city, and vacation in Hawaii for 2 months because being a new mommy is just so very stressful?! And then whine about it?!I'm sorry I wasted my money...and the hours of my life I spent reading it that I'll never ever get back!Spare yourselves! Don't buy this book! If you absolutely have to read it, go to the library! Do not! I repeat, DO NOT waste your money!"
2,Pjur Eros GEL Bodyglide,"Package arrived very quickly, with in 4 days. Wrapped discreetly, with no damage.We had been using the Pjur Eros Original Silicone Lubricant, which we liked a lot. We decided to try the Pjur Eros GEL Bodyglide mainly for the thicker formula. Was disappointed all the way around. The Pjur Eros GEL Bodyglide did not provide as much lubrication, seemed not to last very long. And I really did not like the thicker feel. I'll stick with the Pjur Eros Original Silicone Lubricant."
1,A TERRIBLE PRODUCT!!!,"This is NOT AT ALL like the origional formula, which I LOVE! I bought this thinking they had ""improved"" the stuff in the red bottle. Boy was I wrong! Don't buy it!!! Stick to the origional with the RED label."
5,Etudes,"I teach ballet. This music is a beautiful tribute to ""Etudes"", performed by ABT for many years. Now they consider it ""corny', but it is anything but. Hard to find; but not on Amazon. Prompt delivery, excellent packaging, clear billing methods. Thanks."
5,GREAT,"I love this brand of watch, thin, and very comfortable mesh band, really great if you have small wrist. This is the only type of watch I'll ever were"
2,watch review,"This watch was very nice and the band was well fitting and adjustable, then only issue I had was the date was black background and red numbers, and my father is color blind and was unable to see the date in any light, and I am not color blind and I had difficulty in certian light seeing the date."
5,"Elegant and inexpensive, you hardly notice it on your arm, but others notice!","Lightweight, thin, unobtrusive and comfortable. Very, very sleek, stylish and modern looking. Great watch for the low price."
5,Unique and Stylish,I love the watch. The band is very unique and it's not an obnoxious face that takes up your entire wrist. The only hurdle was understanding the calendar options because of international settings it offers. Great gift that seemingly will stand up to daily use while looking good in the process.
4,Not Quite a Five Star,"This is an excellent product in nearly all ways - it is very stylish, very thin and the band is excellent. The day of the week (MON, TUE, etc) is written in WHITE and has a BLACK background - good design! However, the day of the month (1,2,3, etc) is written in RED and has a BLACK background - bad design!! Unless the surrounding light is excellent you will have great difficulty reading the day of the month. However, I liked the watch so much, despite this design flaw, I decided to keep it."
3,Nice looking watch but beware....,"I bought this watch immediately on looks and feel. Very light, the mesh band is a great feature and the day/date is really great. Classy!However, after 6 months of wearing the watch, multiple scratches and cracks appeared on the supposed reinforced crystal face than on any other watch I've owned. I'm a careful user!!!The final straw was I dropped it on a table from 18 inches and a large crack appeared in the corner and 3 of the time-position bars fell off and are currently moving at will around the watch interior.Beautiful to look at but poor endurance and quality of build. Would not recommend to buy unless you wrap it in cotton wool!"
5,Good deal,My Skagen Watch 396 LTTM is a good and modern looking watch. It has no bling bling; no nonsense; no chronometers you never uses. The time is exact. A perfect watch for a good price.
2,Looks Great But Defective,"Beware, it has great looks, thin and light but the day/date does not work. I am sending it back - hope I get one that works"
3,Defective Day/Date Function,Sharp looking watch but quite a disappointment --- the day and date analog did not advance accurately so I returned it for a replacement. The replacement watch had the same defect advancing the day read-out in 12 hours rather than 24 hours and the date didn't move at all.
1,WHERE THE REST?????,"Okay when i placed the order i was under the impression that i would receive the tee pee looking box of popcorn and the bag of popcorn. Well instead i paid some where around $6.00 for one bag of microwave popcorn. I am curious as to where the rest is for that kind of price on shipping!!!!! I will never get another bag of ""native american"" popcorn again. I will definetly give my business to Orville!!!!"
1,Picture is misleading!,I feel very misled by the picture of this microwave popcorn. I ordered this as a gift thinking that I was ordering what was shown in the picture. Instead of a cute tee pee box I got a plain old bag of microwave popcorn. I had the same experience with the sweetgrass and sage incense that I ordered from this store. Totally different look and package than what was shown.
5,Highly recommend,"All you need to know to plan, buy, install & Maintain your own spa or hot tub. Excellent detailed information on creating the perfect environment for a relaxing soak. Has over 200 color photographs and drawings of spas & hot tubs in attractive indoor & Outdoor settins. It tells you how to buy the spa or hot tub that's just right for you.

Also, includes how to select the correct pump, heater and related quipment, how to successfully install your spa or hot tub and your to keep your spa or tub water sparkling clean. Now if I could only find the time to do it."
4,Great guide to get set up and running,"I picked this up hoping to familiarize myself with vulnerability assessment in general. Although I ran into a few hiccups, the book supplied enough information to get Nessus installed and running fairly easily. Despite having never used Nessus before, I was able to run a scan against a couple Windows machines within a few minutes after installation (and not suprised to find several ""Security Holes"").As a new user of Nessus, I can't really comment on the coverage of the information in the book - other reviewers seem to think highly of it. I can say it the book appears comprehensive and I look forward to delving deeper into the various things Nessus can do."
4,Color is different but still a beautiful purse,"After searching for a long time for a new, spring bag, I settled on this one because of the design and color. I'm an attorney, so I need a bag that is practical (can carry court documents) and professional. I hate the boring briefcases and the pseudo professional and ugly totes that most sites bring up when you enter ""briefcases for women."" I decided I needed something practical AND stylish. This bag is just that.While the color is not as bright as in the pictures (more of a dark bone as opposed to bright bone) and the bag is a lot bigger than I thought, the bag is BEAUTIFUL! I have received lots of compliments on the bag, and this is just my first day with it!!I would recommend buying this bag if you're looking for something a little bigger, practical, beautiful, and stylish. It's a great price for a leather handbag, too."
4,gift,this gift got the response desired. why I would have to write 14 more words is beyond me. good bye.
1,Annoying novelistic style,"As you can see from other reviews, most people seem to really like this book. I, however, got a few pages in and found I had no use for it, even though I generally go for just this sort of story. The authors of ""Great Heart"" use a novelistic narrative style, filling in from their imagination all manner of little details that they obviously could have no way of knowing. I'm apparently enough of a purist that I want my narratives based on reliable source material, not imagination. When an author begins to fictionalize, how can one ever know where the boundary between fact and fiction lies? This doesn't seem to have bothered most of the reviewers, but you might want to stay away from the book if you're similarly picky."
1,Absolutely the worst stand-up video I've ever seen!,"I am a comedy junky and I could not even watch half of this video. The production quality is equivalent to a home vhs camera on a tripod and the audio, while audible, was annoying and distracted from the comedian. Don't waste your time or money!"
3,Ok but doesn't attain its objective,"This book by a well known philosopher is purportedly about ""discovering the mind""-- an important aim in philosophy!However, very little of the book addresses its topic. Kaufmann tends to get lost in digressions concerning the text, biographical details, etc.He claims that these details are important but never really gets to the point.He never really defines what he means by ""mind"" or goes into much detail on how Goethe, Kant or Hegel define or develop the concept.He tends to be repetitious, repeating the same criticisms of Kant again and again-- without any clear exposition of Kant's thinking.Nonetheless I rated it three stars because it is generally clearly written and provides some useful information about these philosophers. I even ordered the other two volumes in the series to see if he gets anywhere in the later books."
1,Grammer and rule oriented text - Es muy mal. or mal muy?,"If you like reading the following paragraph, you will love this book.In constructions that use the infinitive or the present progressive forms, direct objects may either preceede the conjugated verb, or be attached to the infinitive or the present participle (-ndo). Note that when you attach the direct object pronoun to the -ndo form, a written accent is used on the vowel before -ndo.Is it any wonder kids are turned off by school?Here is another example.The auxiliary verb haber agrees with the subject of the sentence. The past participle, however, is invariable when used in the perfect tense.wow. What kind of fool teaches a language like this? Does the author really think that people remember these rules as they speak?This author has a major love affair with grammatical rules. Rules, exception to rules, and then some more grammer rules."
4,Fun to use. Varied media. User-friendly and practical.,"Using comic strips, simple exercises, common sense approach makes learning Spanish painless and fun."
1,Terrible organizer,"This organizer looks great, and I spent some serious money on it, but in the end it was disasterous. I use the wonderful laundry hamper part, but once you put anything in the bins they automatically fall down because there is nothing securing them in. This product is a total let down."
4,Good product durable,I found this hamper storage bin to be great the kids can see into the bins and the bins don't add weight to the unit so the kids can carry the bins easily to pick up toys. However the bins could be a little bigger because they tend to fall off the holding rods if you bump the unit. The hamper is great because my 3 year old son can fill up his hamper but he can't tip it over and spill dirty clothes on the floor but it is light weight and easy for him to help haul to the laundry if he wants to. Good Item
3,DJ Zinc - 138 Trek,"Zinc's _138 Trek_ was released during the waning days of the jungle craze. So instead of frenetic drums all over the place, it opts for more straightforward breaks. The ""Radio Edit"" includes some questionable nattering from an M. C. -- a holdover from the jungle days -- but the ""Original Mix"" foregoes the vocals in favor of more bass. Zed Bias adds some syncopation to the bassline, helping to enliven the track as a whole."
5,Comment on Author,"While I have not read this exact book I have read others by E.G.White. She is very insightful and helpful.Personally, her writings have helped me nearly reverse Type II Diabetes and her advice on health is proving more and more accurate as modern science catches up.I recommend anything by Ellen White"
2,disappointment,"This book was one of the bitterest disappointments of my reading career-After giving us one of the best depictions of the interior life in his diptych,Beyond the Bedroom Wall and Born Brothers,he's has gone further downhill with each book. What makes it even more painful is that the first 2/3 of What I Think I Did are as beautifully written as the stars can be on a clear night in North Dakota,only to have the last third thrown together in a shockingly slapdash and hack manner-I don't get it. But I had a foretaste of disappointment when I saw how overpraised the book was on the back jacket blurbs. I hope he redeems himself with the ""Christian novel"" he said he was going to write in Acts..."
1,not instructional,"this dvd jumped right into a song without detailed, or even a little instructions. i learned nothing. besides the 2 hours of reading between lines i did right when i got it i havent picked it up since."
2,lacked detail,I was in the middle of a project that required curve fitting when I ordered this book. It covered the topics I was interested in but did NOT have sufficient detail to be helpful in an actual project.
1,Be sure to listen to the samples...,"Be sure to listen to the samples before buying this music! If you're anything like me, you'll pass on this and find something else. What a cacophony of sound! Blech!Further, you can actually hear someone coughing in the middle of the fourth movement!"
2,Could be so much better,"This is a subject crying out for a well-written and moderately scholarly history, or at least an excellent popular history. This book is unfortunately neither of these. The translation is very poor (I assume that it is accurate - it is only the English prose that is poor.) There is virtually no documentation. And the book does not address the history of prostitution per se, only episodes, some of which are more convincing than others.I can only assume most historians are squeamish about this subject, so all credit to Mr. Ringdal for trying.I recommend that readers seeking to learn about the impact of or reaction to prostitution look to more defined histories. A good book along those lines is ""Sin in the Second City""."
3,Needs footnotes,"This is a great start, but unfortunately marred by bias and only partial documentation. This is storytelling, not exactly history. I found it frustrating when he would make an amazing assertion and I had no direct reference to trace it, just his bibliography. He has much in common with Herodotus, whose tales he accepts far too uncritically."
2,Limp Stream,"I lookt forward to hearing the ballet, Limpid Stream, again, since it has such charming music. It was the first ballet I danced in as an amateur. But the new version lacks most of the melodic charm that conductor Maxim Shostakovich brought, in his now-out-of-print LP album. This new version is sorta nice, but not at all sparkling. Every ballet teacher in America wanted to have the music. Our ""The Magic Clock"" ballet years ago in Bethesda, Maryland, had a charming story and music. I was very disappointed in Rozhdestvensky (whom I like as a conductor, in the full-length ""Romeo and Juliet"" ballet by Prokofiev.)"
3,Vauable Historical Reference but poorly reproduced,"I was delighted to find a reproduction of this well-known 1882 travel guide. I had located an original copy up for auction, but had to drop out of the bidding before it reached it's eventual sale price of over $500.00. I realized that, as a copy, it would not be perfect but over 50 pages are so blacked out by the copying process that they are illegible. If the original copy had been proofed and then the unreadable pages hand copied and inserted where needed, the book could have been reproduced on order with a much more satisfactory result.That said, the book is a wealth of information about the cities, towns, villages and mining camps of the West in the 1800s (except where it is unreadable, of course)."
5,Rachmaninov: Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom,"As with the Vespers, there are magnificent melodic pieces within this choral work. It is beautifully performed, deeply emotional."
3,Not very global,"The photos are beautiful, but I was disappointed in the narrow range of styles present in the book. Most of the pictures are of asian style with a little South American and India style thrown in. As far as I could tell, there were no pictures of tribal/african style, or other less-well represented styles in mainstream decorating books.I gave the book as many stars as I did for the photos and for the authors at least trying to publish a more diversified book on style. I would have liked to give it more stars, but I was too disappointed in it."
4,"""The Lamps are going out all over Europe"" Sir Edward Grey","Interesting premise, however it is just a collection of lose dissertations that shows the loss to Europe and the gain of the rest of the world with the shift of a hand full of unique people during the Nazi takeover. Much of the information is known. The advantage of this book is that it is in one collection.This includes:BACKGROUND AND MIGRATIONAnti-Intellectualism and the Cultural Decapitation of Germany under the Nazis. ALAN BEYRCHENTHE MUSSES IN AMERICA""Adaptation and influence""German Émigrés in Southern California. JARRELL C. JACKMAN""Transplanting the Arts""European Writers in Exile. ALFRED KAZNCULTURAL ADAPTATION IN WORLDWIDE PERSPECTIVEDas Deutschland: The Anti-Fascist Exile Network in Southern South America. RONALD C. NEWTON"
3,Cute,"It was your basic romance with a comfortable, familiar plot. I read the entire series (there are three) and I enjoyed them. The story flowed well enough and was easy to read."
2,Want to ensure a man loves you forever? lie to him..,"How do you know you're reading a bad romance novel - the romance begins on a lie, stays on a lie, and folks get married, anyway.I just hate this type of book - everything is built on a lie - and a lie for no very good reason - unless you think greed is a good reason to lie.I suppose we're supposed to think that Lucille is caught between her loyalty of her cyprian twin sister, Susannah, and the growing affection she feels for the Earl of Seagrave. But I don't know - it was very hard for me to muster much sympathy for any of the characters - Susannah, Lucille, or the Earl.I highly recommend you save your money and not bother with this one."
5,Perfect bowl for small dogs,I found this dish years ago and loved it from the get go. Perfect for small mouths. Its unique design will accommodate your pooch's mouth and allow them to get every last morsel of food!
2,Not that great,The case has a nice tight fit. Almost too tight. If you ever need to get it off - you will struggle. The main complaint I have with the case is the plastic that covers the front face is so tight that it makes bubbles on top of the phone's plastic front - making it difficult to read. The thumbwheel is also hard to use when in the case.I don't think this case would be much protection if you were to drop it either.Overall I think there are better case options for this phone.
4,+ 1/2 stars...A Stellar Guitarist,"Alex de Grassi was with Windham Hill almost from the beginning. His 1978 album TURNING: TURNING BACK was only the fourth release on his cousin Will Ackerman's fledgling label. De Grassi would eventually record six albums for Windham Hill and they are all represented here (although ""Clockwork"" is taken from 1983's AN EVENING WITH WINDHAM HILL). Perhaps my favorite track is the whimsical ""Children's Dance"" from his debut.De Grassi occasionally works with other musicians (like Paul McCandless, oboe, on the bonus track ""Gymnpeie""), but the focus is squarely on de Grassi's innovative fingerstyle guitar playing. Even if you own Windham Hill's equally excellent RETROSPECTIVE from 1992, PURE only duplicates six of those tracks. Released as one of a series of collections to commemorate Windham Hill's 30th anniversary, PURE ALEX DE GRASSI is a terrific introduction to this talented guitarist. [Running Time - 61:34] VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
4,Floppy and Fun,This is a very durable Frisbee and my dog prefers it over the plastic ones since it is very flexible and easier to pick up. We liked the first one so much we bought a second one!
3,My dog loves these,"I've purchased nearly 10 of these. They are soft enough for my dog to catch without hurting her mouth. She won't walk without one in her mouth. My only gripe is that they don' t always float. Since all of our dog toys end up in the lake at some point, we've lost quite a few of them."
1,It sinks!,"I bought this ""Floating Disc"" to use with my bog in the water. IT SINKS. Plus it is hard to throw on land.Bottom Line: IT SINKS IN WATER !"
2,Teutonic Twaddle,'Constituting Critique: Kant's Writing As Critical Praxis (Post-Contemporary Interventions)' was translated from its original German in 1994. I can only hope that the publisher will eventually get around to translating the title into English as well.
3,"Nice power, when it works...","I've been using this amp for my two 10"" Sony Xplod subs and they hit HARD. No complaints with sound or inadequate power but about a month ago it started having problems. Everytime i turned my car off it blew a fuse. The people at circuit city knew enough to tell me it was the amp and not the wires but they didn't have the equiptment to invesigate further so now im out $200 and have two killer subs that i can't use..."
4,How to visit Paris and a new kind of litterature,"The story? It doesn't really matter. Yes, it's a kind of detective book. With a real french inspector. There's a murder (someone killed a dog). There's a beautiful heroin (with no description, but only imagination). But what you have to savour, are words. Words and atmosphere. As a French person, I really rediscover the place i leave in (it takes place in the Marais). And the characters are so true! If you want to appreciate the parisian cafe atmosphere, some of our every day dysfunctionnement (how to get a book in a library), and so many thing. The way the book is written is amazing. I really wonder how it had been translate, because there are so many subtleties... It's a great book, written by a french contemporary writer, member of the OuLiPo group (with Queneau, Perec, Fournel...)and is representative of this trend."
3,"Yes it works, yes it is also cheap","I got one of these for my wife phone, it works great. It is cheap material, you can tell by touching it. After it lived in the car for a few months the cable sheared off right at the plastic base (just short enough that I couldn't fix it). So I ordered another one because this one is so cheap I could order several before its worth it to buy the store brand one. This time used electrical tape (you could also shrink wrap it) around the base where the cord goes into it and re-enforced it. It is still working. If it breaks I will just buy another one.Very cheap and therefore it is worth the money, maybe yours won't break, my second one hasn't."
5,Surprisingly extensive in it's coverage,"I didn't expect this book to cover as many topics as it does. It starts with the basics of surfing the web (using IE), but then continues on to cover advanced use of Google, email, stopping spam, instant messaging, videoconferencing, and even blogging. The coverage is terse and graphics intensive. Each of the 100 items is covered by two glossy color pages rich with screen shots with hilighting arrows and circles. Some topics, like web browsing, are covered by many items, while others, like blogging, only one or two. The technique is effective and appealing, and lends some excitement to learning about practical use of the Internet."
3,Commendable version of old German marches,"This version of Preussens Gloria captures the classic marches that you would want to here. It is however a Bundeswehr-type recording so it slightly lacks ""grassroot"" gravity in the bass-line and the old upright army xylophone (can't think of the right term) which adds the spark. Otherwise great to wake with in your car to work..."
2,Too much feedback! Improvement needed on the microphone!,"We bought this for our 4 1/2 yr old grandson. He LOVED it...for the siren sounds. The sirens worked great, however, the microphone had so much feedback that our nerves were frayed in less than 45 seconds. The directions stated that you needed to hold the microphone a certain distance away from the speaker. We held it the maximum length the wire could stretch and it still squawked!"
2,"Agree with most ratings, poor product","I have to agree with some of the lower star comments. First, it is not user friendly. Second, it will not locate alot of addresses. Third, the instructions are very poor. Fourth and final, the screen is very difficult to read during the day. I am in the process of exchange to a better rated unit. You get what you pay for,""true in this case""."
2,unintuitive,Out of the box - it hasn't been easy to figure out how to get around. I haven't had time to read the manual but I never had to with my Garmin. It didn't charge in the cigarette lighter on my rental car and left me stranded in Dallas - Lost. I had to call for help. The map did not reflect road changes that were made at least 10 years ago. Out of date cartography!-- Frustrating. Whole freeways missing.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS GPS,"I was excited about getting a GPS and after seeing the price on this one and reading lots of favorable reviews i picked this one up. The unit is sleek and nice looking. Thats all is good about it. I punched in my office address which has been in existence for at least 10 years, it did not show up. punched in 10 more addresses that have been around for at least 5 years, no luck. All this was done outdoors. I didnt think any more and returned it.I picked up a Garmin StreetPilot c340 and this thing is awesome.My advice, dont waste ur time and money on this GPS.If i cud i wud give it 0 stars, but the least is 1 star."
1,Bad GPS,If I followed it I would have gotten off the freeway at every off ramp between Oakland Ca & Folsom CA
4,ViaMichelin X930 GPS,"Good GPS, catching plenty of signal, pretty accurate. Good basic entry-level portable GPS. Highly recommended."
3,okay for the price,"I bought this GPS for my 20 yr old directionally challenged son.The product works fine. Unfortunately, the preloaded maps are several years outdated. The company claims that an update is due ""soon"". We don't know at this point if they are going to charge for that as well.The directions tend to take you on some very strange paths no matter what preferences you set (odd turns through neighborhoods rather than staying on main roads.)I wouldn't recommend this product."
1,Bletch,"It's hard to use, resets or turns off while in use, though plugged in the charger or recently unplugged from charger. Unreliable for directions. Thumbs down. Save up and get the Garmin which I got the opportunity to use and loved. Purchased the garmin for a few other people who loved it as well/"
3,Works fine,"Menu is a little clunky. It fits will in our car. We live in Boston, so it does not always know the easiest way to get around."
4,ViaMichelin X-930 Portable Navigation GPS with Preloaded Maps,"It does not answer the phoneIt does not play musicIt won't bake a cakeor brew a cup of coffee.Once you figure out the instructions, it may take a few trial and error attemps, you will never be lost again.I have never been more than 15 feet from the information I entered.If you input the wrong information, that is where you will end up.I love this GPS"
4,"Best value, slim, GPS navigator available!","Skeptical of the low price, I got this GPS to try it out and return but I'm definitely keeping it. It was the cheapest GPS I could find out on the market that was small enough to fit in my shirt pocket.Pros:+ price, $170+ good gps signal reception+ slim, fits in my shirt pocket but its mistaken for a pocket protector often+ bypass / detour calculation, good for finding alternate routes+ quicker time / short distance priority mode, good for taking local roads+ time/distance to destination displayCons:- no automatic night mode- slow, delayed response. to feel better, see price to justify. (its built on WinCE)- UI is not elite like the Garmins but I can live with it. My manual is still in the box."
1,No a good product.,"Initially it worked fine, after 2 weeks started creating trouble. If you make it work for continuously for 10 minutes it hung, then you may need to reset to bring it back to normal."
2,Seen better GPS products,"Although purchased at a low price, the device is difficult to update using their software. You can add Points of Interest via their software but I could not understand if its possible to update the map that's on the SD memory card. Also, still not sure how to have the GPS display your movements without having a route planned."
1,Very Bad,"This product is just bad. It froze at critial times (often). It was hard to reboot. It gave me wroong directions several times (even took me threw NYC when I wanted to go to upstate NY. Terrible product! At one point, the unit frooze for good and could not be fixed. The software is useless. I could go on forever. Stay away."
1,HUGE RIP-OFF! OLD MAPS!,"This unit is essentially a paperweight. The maps are ridiculously old and there is no chance of getting updated versions, since ViaMichelin is no longer making GPS units. They have also turned a deaf ear to the existing customers who are begging for new maps. If you call customer service, they will outright LIE and say that new maps are coming soon, but don't believe it. The smart money is on anything but a ViaMichelin."
1,Don't Buy A ViaMichelin GPS,ViaMichelin is exiting the US GPS market and will not support updates to the old 2005 maps. I heard this right from the horse's mouth. The unit I own didn't even recognize portions of the PA Turnpike which has been in existence for over 50 years.
1,Avoid this bare bones unit,"This GPS has no free range navigation. In other words, you can't just turn it on and see where you are and your speed. You have to give it a destination first. That's just plain dumb. Avoid at all costs."
2,Don't drop it!,"I dropped mine and it never worked again. The screen shattered, and it wasn't even that far of a fall."
2,Disappointed,"We were very unhappy with the difficulty in navigating the product. Although the first customer service person was excellent,(Michelle) the second was almost rude. Plus, we had difficulty reading the screen while mounted on the dash, during bright, sunshine hours. Wouldn't recommend it. Looking for my refund."
3,It's Definitely Not a TomTom,"I was disappointed with this product, mainly because as previous owner of a TomTom product, my expectations with GPS interfaces is quite high. The X-930 certain does the bare minimum for navigation if you know the address of the location you are going to. That's pretty much it. It's inexpensive and bare-bones and not very easy to use. If you are looking for something more intuitive, more roboust, and shorter learning curve, go for the TomTom One. It's worth the extra money."
3,Great for New Finds,"This product is great to find stuff in a new city. If your traveling, bring it along for once you arrive. However, do not use it to get directions to a destination far from where you live. It doesn't pick the ""quickest"" route as it's feature says, and can add hours to your trip. Better to use Yahoo Maps or MapQuest, and then use this as a back-up. It's definately great for finding points of interest in a city. I found several things in my town that I was unaware of. I definitely would bring it along on every trip."
4,ViaMichelin GPS Portable Navigation System,A great value. High quality and accurate without unnecessary bells and whistles. More factory-made-looking than others I've seen. Does everything I wanted. Highly recommend it if you don't want to pay several hundred Dollars.
3,ok for the price,"This product is a good deal for the price, but the instructions leave a lot to be desired & I haven't found a way to get alternate routes if there's a problem on the one it suggests, other than just going a different way and letting it recalculate."
2,"not too user friendly or intuitive - JWo Columbus, OH",This thing is not too user friendly or intuitive. If you like pushing buttons this may be the model for you. I've bought the Garmin c330 unit since (after I returned the ViaMichelin model) and that is working much better for me...much more user friendly and intuitive. I've paid $125 more the entry level Garmin unit but I'm much happier...you do get what you pay for sometimes. The Garmin unit processes faster and does not tell me to take U-turns (which are illegal in my state). For me ViaMichelin=Frown and Garmin=Smile.
2,Great winsheild mount,"Bought this on Friday, worked with it today. It could not find my address or street, so one thinks use the gps coords to help. Well then you have to key in the entire coords, the unit should be able to default your current position and allow you to route from there. It could not find the shoe store I wanted a route to. I found it faster using yahoo online. This item will be returned Monday.As other reviews have stated, the interface is horrible and could not be used well in the car, unless you want to pull off the road for several minutes to try to place a new route in."
4,IMHO,"Just got a new X-930 unit for an incredible price of $169.99 recently. I've never owned a GPS before and was excited at the low price AND size of the device...it really is pocket sized! Being a lover of gadgets and one with limited means...I just could not help myself!From reading other reviews I was skeptical...it's very true that the input is a bit awkward, it just takes some getting used to (like most everything). I'm a newbie to GPS devices but consider my self 'tech savvy', I've had no problems (so far) using this unit to replace my frequent searches on 'MapQuest' or 'GoogleMaps' for finding directions to addresses.For the money I paid...it is well worth it!!!"
3,Basic Unit at a Good Price,"The Michelin X-930 is a basic GPS unit with portability and a great price. What you give up are the flexibility and bells and whistles of a more expensive, name-brand product. This product works well as a ""learning device"" to get your feet wet and is cheap enough as a added item for a trip you are making. Recommended as first purchase but not as a serious GPS expenditure."
2,Good but not great,"The price is right for this little unit and if you are looking for an on-board navigation system this unit is for you. The voice is loud and clear, and the unit is easy to setup and start using quickly.On the downside is that this unit goes to sleep if it is not ""working"" for you, so if you just want to see the GPS coordinates change as you drive, pay attention because it will suddenly turn off.Also this unit does not update frequently enough to make it useful in pedestrian mode. Anyone heard of Geo caching? This is not the unit for you if you are looking for a geocaching GPS.The last disappointment of this unit is the cumbersome search for any POI. WalMart should be listed as a POI, and I have yet to find one listed. WalMart and gas stations...what else does anyone need?"
4,Free Range Option,Jsut Got this great Little GPS system and love it! Took a few minutes to learn all the ins and outs but its not to hard. A prevous reviewer stated that you shouldnt get this unit becuase it had no free range roam..where in you dont need to enter a destination to see where you are..thats 100% not true. You just need to read the directions and it tells you how to set that up. Tracks you anywhere as you go.
2,Very Complicated,This was a very complicated unit. I couldn't even get a map to come up on it. Sent it back.
4,Michelin GPS,"The product has a satisfactory performance within the lower 48.However, I purchased it for the primary use of driving between Seattle and Vancouver, BC.This we found out after purchase it cannot do!It only came with the US maps preloaded on a 1GB card.We purchased a 2GB card only to find we could not down load both the US and Canada maps to the same card.The maps cannot integrate, unlike `Microsoft Streets and Trips 2006.' Hence, we are unable to obtain continuous use in a North South direction.Although the product seems to be satisfactory around Seattle, it is unsatisfactory when driving to and around Vancouver BC.For people living in southern California, it cannot be used in Mexico.Overall, we were disappointed with our purchase.As Michelin, have always, been noted for their travel guides this is a major let down."
1,My unit died after 2 months,"My ViaMichelin X-930 completly died after 2 months. It would no longer see the SD card inside of it. I also could not ever get any of the upgrades from their website to load. It wasted a lot of my time, monkeying with it. The fact it was unusable in such a short time, rates it as junk with me. Save yourself from this GPS. It also lacked POI's, did not work well in rural areas, and is not good for any RV uses either. The volume buttons also did not do anything. The case was nice though, but alas not heavy enough to be a paper weight."
5,Best Deal Anywhere,"Absolutely the best deal going. Works great, user friendly, not a bunch of useless bells and whistles. Everyone should own one!"
5,ViaMichelin X-930,"I gave this as a gift to our daughter, Debra Bassett. We already have 2 GPS and enjoy using them. One is the X-930 and the other is bigger, a Maggellen Roadmate."
1,"NO USA CUSTOMER SUPPORT, NO MAP UPDATES - DON'T BUY","I bought my X-930 two years ago. Since then the there have been lot of changes in the maps and I wanted to update the maps, as the GPS info became increasingly unreliable. Unfortunately there is NO CUSTOMER SUPPORT in US, no physical address, NO PHONE NUMBER TO CONTACT, NO MAP UPDATES. Go to [...] and see for yourself. I am left hanging and have to now spend another $200 to buy a new GPS device. I recommend don't buy this product, instead purchase a brand made in US."
3,Umm???,ViaMichelin X-930 3.5-Inch Portable GPS NavigatorThought it would of been more convenient to use than using the navigator on my phone. It wasnt. Easier and faster to use my phone.
1,BAd Choice Overall - Bad routing/slow/freezes,A very poorly made product. The screen freezes and the system shuts down and then you are left at the mercies of the heaven. The Michelin guys wont help you out either and you cannot return it.
3,"Good, not Great","This GPS system is the least expensive of its kind and it works. For basic navigation, it is adequate, however, after a 2500 mile trip, there are some concerns. As other reviews have indicated, some of the information is outdated. Also, this system has a tendency to stick to interstates when other routes might be more appropriate. The battery life of the unit is slowly diminishing. Of course, because of the price, this unit will not apprise you of traffic slowdowns or accidents ahead.The good things this unit provides are these features: distance traveled, distance and time to destination, speed and direction. Being able to estimate ETA has proved handy as I was able to tell those folks at the destination my estimated arrival time.If you are looking for the basics, this is a good unit. If you are looking for more bells and whistles, you may need to spend more money."
3,Okay but not easy,If you are looking for a gps that gets you from a to b then this one does it well. The unit is quick and even works indoors. But it is not user friendly. Traded it for the Garmin 220 and it is better for what i need. Especially points of interest. They all loose there flair after about a week so go on your budget and what you really want it for. I recommend to go with a Garmin. they are just better.
4,ViaMichelin X-930 Portable GPS USA,"I have rated the unit 4 stars instead of 5 stars because the preloaded maps seem to be a little older than the claimed 2005 maps.Otherwise, this is a really fine unit because:1. It's very accurate, just about door to door.2. It's versatile, even if you deviate to your favorite roads, the unit will accomodate your choice and continue from where ever you are.3. You can plan a trip and view the calculated path on a map, or simply navigate to a destination from your present location.You can't get lost with this unit!!! It's great!"
2,"Bad product, bad support","Pros: light weightCons:1. Map is very outdated (at least 2 years old). Many errors in the area I live (San Jose, CA). It told me to take a U turn where it was prohibited. It also once told me to take a left turn against the traffic on a divided street.2. Some address could not be saved. It always showed up as another address when you tried to navigate to it.3. Guidance is especially confusing when entering and exiting highway. For example, on a two-lane highway exit, one for straight and left turn, and the other to the right. It showed right turn on display, but said ""continue straight ahead"".4. Slow re-routing.Bottom line: this kit should be used with caution and good judgement due to the inaccurate map and sometime confusing voice guidance.Update: after serval months of use, I would change my rating to 1 star if I can."
4,That's nice deal and GPS,"It is not bad. I like it.But it has a problem that could show the street name, when I use 3D. But if I use the 2D on a map, I can see the street name on map but no voice to directe me."
3,it good,it good but it download very slowly . i just go half an hour wrong way yesterday because of it downloading slow . i don't know how to improve it . i think it would be better to have it than having nothing.
5,"An amazing, amazing group! I love Matson Jones!","I stumbled upon this group while listening to Pandora.com last weekend, and ordered this EP based on the one song I heard. I love the originality of the songwriting, and especially of the instrumentation (2 cellos, 1 bass, 1 drummer). The female vocals and harmonies are also great. I've been listening to this brilliantly titled EP over and over since it came in the mail 2 days ago, and am now ordering their self-titled album, which is the only other one I can locate. There is a bunch of their stuff on YouTube, but I don't understand why they aren't world-wide famous. An excellent set of songs from an excellent band!"
5,Far out!,A great documentary. I could watch it over and over - just to see all the great Lebowski-inspired costumes! The perfect gift for any Achiever.
2,"Like title says, about the fans, not lebowski.","This movie is about a small group of Lebowski fans. As it happens, i believe those fans are the only ones will find the film entertaining for more than 5 minutes. Rent it like I did if you are still interested."
5,Brawler Rocks,"Brawler is a finely crafted film with fascinating characters, charming and gritty effective settings, exciting action including some of the best fight scenes on film today, and an original and compelling score. To get a taste of the film watch the Brawler trailer available on YouTube. Not sure what this guy from Seattle who gave it one star and made all sorts of negative statements is up to, frankly doubt he watched it. From his other Amazon reviews he appears to be a cyber bully. Brawler is a great independent film, one of the best I have seen in a long time. Highly recommended."
4,Brawler,Great movie filmed by a new orleaian in New Orleans !! It is a action packed thriller start to finish !
1,"If crap could make a movie, this would be it","I will not bore you with a long drawn out, sub-par, unintelligent, poorly devised and incredibly crappy review of the movie as it has done for the last hour and a half of my life. I will simply say, this is without a doubt, beyond any hope, the single worse movie I have ever seen in my life. They have destroyed our earth by putting this onto plastic. This movie will be around forever, and a thousand generations from now, someone will find a disk and know that we were this stupidest generation to ever walk the earth because someone put this outstandingly bad piece of trash onto a disk. I feel stupider for watching it."
5,"Better vocals, great songs","After their previous album produced a couple of hits, Bacilos went back to the drawing board. Singer and writer Jorge Villamiz honed his vocal technique. Sinverguenza takes Bacilos to a new level of music-making. Some songs on this album offer social commentary, others are about human relationships. No two songs are alike. It is impossible to determine which will be radio hits, as all offer something unique. This album is a leap forward for Bacilos in music making. This is a much better, mature, and talented group than in their previous album. If you liked their previous album, or if you just like great modern latin music, buy this album."
1,A Step Backwards,"I think Bacilos would be well-served to go back to the drawing board. This album sounds like they did not put the work in to write some excellent songs; the music's sound is not very memorable, the lyrics aren't very memorable, and it's almost as if they just changed the words from bad songs from their previous albums to make this one. I saw them in concert in Virginia, and unfortunately they were so caught up in promoting their albums that they played two of their most famous songs two or three times, and alienated a number of fans there who were previously Bacilos-lovers (and emerged as more impressed with upstarts such as CABAS). So, I agree with the other reviewer that rated this CD a bust. Save your money for emerging latin rock stars such as Locos Por Juana, rather than a Bacilos that is not putting its best effort forwards."
1,I returned it.,I got this to use on the LCD of my Nikon P5100. At 4x it was too much. The overpixilation defeated the purpose for which I bought it. It did the opposite of making the image sharper.I returned it.
2,Not up to expectations,I bought this cable to replace a damaged cable from Monster. Used it for my projector and saw a visible drop in level of sharpness and quality of video from what I got from Monster brand cable. The Amazon folks were quite nice about it and took it back without any hassle or restocking fee.
3,Engaging but flawed,"As a mother reading aloud with a 10-year-old boy, I am always on the lookout for fiction (and nonfiction) that portrays boys as heroic and resourceful beings who do not need to be rescued by girls every time they get in a bind. This book was enjoyed by both of us for its plot and descriptions. I was a bit put off by the creepy child molester and thought that part could have been left out. While parents need to have ""that talk"" with their kids, it was awkward and not entertaining to have that situation arise unexpectedly during our reading time. I also was surprised by the number of sentence fragments and other examples of poor grammar throughout the book. Authors of kids' books - please help us out by modeling good grammar! We may read another of this author's books; the historical setting and problem-solving by the protagonist were admirable. My son loved the dog."
4,A wonderful treat!,"To be honest, I was a little skeptical about these things at first. But I had heard good things about them, so I decided to try. Am I glad I did! They are quite tasty, and the chocolate isn't intolerably sweet like you find on a lot of candies. This is great for people like me, who love chocolate but can't stand all that sugar. The biggest flaw I can think of is that they disappeared quite fast; I just couldn't get enough.The product, itself, arrived quite promptly. And, as my store just doesn't carry this stuff, I'll definitely be ordering from these people again."
3,Better Pocky Out There,"I have to admit, that Glico sometimes have made some exceptional snacks with their Pocky range, such as their Pocky Strawberry, which is a blast. With this milk chocolate version, I was not so impressed.The idea is the same: pretzel stick dipped in chocolate. It is not as sweet as some, so those who do not like sugar-induced psychosis will appreciate these snacks.Overall, the taste is ok, but I found myself rather quickly bored with them. Other varieties of Pocky were much more interesting. Having said that, they make a great reading snack, as they do not leave your fingers covered in garbage, and your pages stay clean.Not a bad snack, but other flavours are more interesting."
3,"Love these divas, but....","I didn't go for this cd nearly as much as Sing! Sing! Sing!, which is close to perfect. This recording has too many strings for my taste. Still, this is a group whose output I'll always look forward to."
2,Cheap,"I guess you get what you pay for - this is flimsy and cheap, but covers your head nicely. It will not keep you warm in cold weather."
2,sent to wrong address,product was shipped to incorrect address.... company charged me a second shipping charge to send out a new one... poor customer service
2,Too Much Acrylic Fibers and Not Enough Wool,"This blaze orange stocking cap is made primarily for hunters (or other people working outdoors who require high visibility). I bought one for hunting purposes and frankly was disappointed in the insulating ability of this cap. In my experience, the wind was able to penetrate the cap fairly easily making my head feel cold. Doing some research, I found that 100% acrylic caps are great for ACTIVE outdoor use, because they wick perspiration from the scalp and hair. However, in terms of insulating quality, these pale in comparison to a blended wool or 100% wool cap. Wool is a great insulator, so if maximum warmth is required for stationary activities outdoors, this is NOT the cap you want to purchase. Go for a (highgram) thinsulate or 100% wool stocking cap instead. This acrylic cap is fine for active outdoor use, such as running, skiing, snow-shoeing, etc.konedog"
5,warm hat for cool days,great for walking in 30 degree F weather. great for running in 20 degree weather. below 20 degrees I prefer to use a wool watch cap.
2,Too Thin,"Not the best quality hat, thin and not very warm. For sure not a military watch cap. Maybe style wise but not for function."
3,"Better than some, not as good as others.","This set was really fun. I bought it for my son and the problem was the difficulty mylittle guy to had reving the cars and then hitting the button at the correct time to make it change gears. But once it got going it was a blast. It is not durable at all and I had to superglue the parts together and it still didn't hold. To put it away, everything falls apart and you ahve to reassemble it everytime. I'm dissapointed in the craftsmanship, but very happy with the idea. The plastic is flimsy and it breaks apart easily. Don't spend too much money on it, but if you can find it for a cheap price, splurge. It is a fun toy all in all."
5,GREAT LITTLE GIRL'S TOY,"My 2-year old just received this as a gift for her 2nd birthday. The dolls come with outfits can can easily be ""snapped on"" by a youngster, and hair they can comb. My only problem was I had to buy a second one for her 3-year old sister so they wouldn't fight over the one doll. They promptly go to bed with these dolls. The price is right and the accessories are fun for them. I most likely will pick up more...Great Toy!"
4,"Good, but some things left unsaid","This is a really sweet story about the power of enduring love, but there are some things that the author left unsettled. There are questions that she raises, but never answers--like the relationship of one character to the other's father. Answers to these questions would have explained a lot of actions by both characters. Also, the ancillary storylines aren't well fleshed out. It's a good read, but it could have used 5000 or so more words to really flesh out the story."
3,its okay,"i use it at dest next to bed, it cannot be used for reading.and the price is not really good deal"
1,Arrived broken,"Ordered black lamp, received red lamp.The knob switch immediately fell off. The switch never worked. Too cheap to return."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,"Right when I received the item, it looked and felt like a cheap item.. I knew it wasn't gonna last long. After about a month or so, THE SWITCH BUTTON BROKE and i have no choice but the throw this crappy thing away.Spend a little more money and buy something other than this one."
1,Piece of JUNK!,"This is the second lamp I own. First one was a gift. Second the wife bought for me. The switch for the light is the cheapest switch they could use. I highly doubt it is UL listed as the switches go bad after about 10 hours of use. Now I have another that I must go get a replacement switch for to repair. Alas they dont put enough wire in to make it servicable, so you have a tight cable grip at base of light you must fight to remove. SighSave your money and buy something else or be prepared to replace the light switch.the link to the replacement part.[...]"
3,cheap little lamp gets the job done,"This cheap little lamp gets the job done. My main issue with it is the way the light is dispersed. I don't know if it is just the bulb I got, but the bulb is extremely bright and it only lights up a small area on the table. But it gets the job done."
2,Received defective lamp.,"This happens too often with items purchased through Amazon Warehouse: item described as 'Like New', yet is defective or not as described when received. Switch was faulty on lamp, had to repeatedly turn it in order to get it to click off/on. A quick test at the Warehouse would have revealed this and saved us both some time- where's Quality Control? Returning for refund."
1,Please beware,"The first lamp I received the power button did not work. I returned it to Amazon without a problem for an even exchange. I received my exchange today and not only does the ""new"" lamp not work (the outlet and bulb works just fine), but it was dusty and scratched up. I am returning it for a refund and will buy a different brand."
3,Not as good as i expect,"This lamp is not as good as i expect, altough it works . the main problem is : it is not stable. If you touch it slightly, it would tilt and then fall over...."
5,Just What I Needed!,"I bought this as a replacement lamp when my bankers lamp of 14 years died. It takes both incandescent and CFL bulbs. The blue color of the lamp is great and is exactly as pictured. It's best to adjust the neck before you switch on the lamp, because the lamp does get really hot. I am really glad I was able to get this lamp at Amazon. Before I found this lamp online, I went to an office supply store (that I won't name) looking for a desk lamp. The store manager told me that they no longer carried desk lamps in-store and it was going to have to be a special order and take at least a week, so I passed. Thank God for Amazon!"
5,Desk Lamp I use for my vanity table,This was an affordable lamp that really helps light up the area on my vanity table. I use it to apply makeup and do my hair every morning. I really like it - it is more cost effective than the vanity light up mirrors.
2,Purchase Burn Spray for your skin.,"At first, I loved this item, then five minutes later I decided to adjust the angle of the light and scorched my palm. WTF?! Thanks for the burnt hand, Goosy! Seriously? This passed ""Quality Control"" standards? Thank god I put this lamp out of reach of my toddler as it is on my desk several feet off the ground. Now i understand the $15 price tag for a lamp with this good of lighting. It should be a 5 star item, instead its a 1st degree burn."
4,cheap and efficient,"i'm using it right now. the lamp is super inexpensive and uses a nice generic a type bulb. perfect! it has worked for a few months now, no problem, so I give it 2 thumbs up for utilitarianism, minus a star for being snoringly generic."
2,Not enough practice,"This book is loaded with repetitive strategies that can be applied to each section of the GMAT, i.e. Joe Bloggs, process of elimination. It goes through each section explaining how to use these strategies with a few examples per section. There are also a few drill exercises. There are not enough practice questions. There is not a full exam for you to practice with and gauge your score either. There are a few problem ""bins"" at the end of the book. The way it gauges your score is if you get less than 5 correct, your score would be 200-400 etc. That does not seem very accurate. Then, the explanations for the answers are very inadequate. Overall, I would say this might be a good book for someone who has already taken the test and just wants to brush up. It is not very in-depth."
4,Loud,"Had this put on a v6 tundra. It was too Loud for me. I turned up the music and could still hear the drone. It's loud and deep. Good soundin, but too loud for my taste. This muffler definitely turns heads and will get you a ticket."
1,For the none GPS person not much new stuff,There is not much change compared to the 2007 software. I just use it for mapping and the fact that the location markers are static has not changed making it inferior to many other products. Will not purchase this product anymore if they do not change the location markers.
1,Doesn't work on old computers,I have been buying S&T; since it came out. I've enjoyed it until S&T; 2008.I have an old computer with a CD drive. The new S&T; comes with a DVD. It will not load on my computer. Contacted Microsoft and they told me to upgrade my computer and they could not and would not help me get it loaded.Very disappointed with Microsoft and will now have to look for a product I can use on my old computer.
2,nothing new,Seems there is nothing new on this version. Many major new streets and highways that have been open well over a year are not on their maps. I wanted it to upgrade from V2003 but it was a was a waste of money!
5,Excellent program,Streets is an excellent program in any of its versions. I think I started using it in 2002 or so and have purchased several versions including TWO copies of this version. I like 2008 better than the new 2010 version which I recently downloaded and tried on their 60 day trial. The trial lasted 5 days. I'll stick with 2008 until there are so many new streets built that it is no longer useful. I'm sure that will take a few years...ha.
3,it doesnt work in my comp. Microsoft sent me a new one,The cd doesnt work. i called Microsoft and they sent me a new one because it has warranty.
1,Very Disappointed,"I installed this program on my desktop at my apartment. Then I tried to install it on my desktop at my wife's apartment where I spend half my time. Microsoft wouldn't allow it and told me I would have to pay for a second copy, this even though they would allow it on my second copy IF IT WERE A LAPTOP! No other program has ever restricted me to less than two computers, or ""for personal use"" on as many computers as is necessary. I would steer clear of th;is product, and by extension, other MS products as well, for being so greedy. Michael"
2,microsoft verses copilot gps/mapping software,I cant go into to much detail on this but from the little experience I had with the microsoft software I did not like it. I also have copilot gps for laptops which i thought was much better then this. I was a professional truck driver so I used my copilot quit a bit. got the this to see if I could get more locations points which didnt pan out.
3,Activation required,Been a Street and Trips user for years. The cost of an upgrade seem small even though at times I didn't see much need to.This is the first year that Streets and Trips required activation. Fortunately I didn't have the problems that others have reported. I have used the product with a external gps antenna and it worked well.
3,Not much of an upgrade,"Very disappointed in the upgrades made to this product since the 2006 version. I was hoping to have new neighborhoods included on it, and they aren't, so it was essentially a waste of money. It does have some nice features added, like the ""reverse route"" function, but overall, hasn't really worked to include new subdivisions (at least in Colorado) at all."
2,Disappointed,"I am somewhat disappointed in this version. I have been buying this product every year since 2003 except for 2007 when I couldn't find a copy. I don't notice very much of a difference between this versions information and the 2006, I don't see that many new roads in areas that I know have new roads (since 2006). This version has more security features, read that as only being able to load it on 2 computers, takes a LOT longer to load. Takes a long time to come up when you want to use the program. I prefer using the 2006 that I have on the companies laptop."
2,Disappointed in Street & Trips 2008,There seems to be very little effort in improving the product from previous versions. It also is quite a challenge to get it to work on Vista. Install works but then it wouldn't run after the first week.
1,Not worth the hassle of an upgrade,"I use S & T 2005, and it works just fine, even with the slight interface issues. Every time I come to purchase the latest version, I am reminded that the copyright protection is annoying and dependant on online registration. I won't be spending my money on such a product which requires online registration. I am getting ready to replace my road warrior laptop, and I value my time too much to spend it trying to contact a MS representative to convince the phone drone that I legitimately purchased the software, and need to get my license enabled for installation onto another machine because I have purchased a newer laptop.Combine that with the numerous comments that there is no improvement over content of UI design, then the reason to purchase is a no brainer.I almost forgot, there are many reviewed comments that the products installation is unstable on many laptops. This last fact pretty much renders this latest and greatest version worthless IMHO."
3,Map updates a disappointment,"For several local streets that have been changed or added for two or three years now, there is no difference in the map information between the 2008 and the 2005 version which I had. This was the main reason I upgraded. Big disappointment!"
3,Not better than the 2005 Version,"I bought this because I was hoping for updated maps and additional features. I find that the program startup now takes 3-4 times as long as the 2005 version. It seems that Microsoft is checking in to see if you are a registered legal owner before the initialization finishes. The product otherwise seems largely the same as the 2005 version. The newest sections of my neighborhood are still not on the map, consequently, it creates a longer route. Honestly, Google Maps, Mapquest and the like have the same problems. Anyway, I feel like I was ripped off because I got almost nothing new for my money."
1,Please save your money - Keep 2007,No significant updates and activation problems.This is a mess. I have purchased upgrade every year and this year is worthless.Save you money and stick with 2007.
1,Waste of time and money (unable to activate),"Tried to install the software on my desktop computer. All went well until it came time to activate the software (over the Internet). The attempt returned a network error, and continued to do so on every subsequent attempt. I then spent hours on the phone to Microsoft without any success activating it. The case was elevated and I was told that they (Microsoft) would be in touch. That was two weeks ago and I have not heard another peep from Microsoft. In the meantime, I have discovered that this is a ""known problem"" with Streets & Trips 2008. But, unfortunately, the solution to the problem is apparently still unknown. Bottom line? Inexcusable crap. I would give this software no stars if I could."
1,Microsoft Streets & Trips 2008,"I have installed this software every year for the last 6 years.However, this is the first upgrade requiring activation. I could not activate it, either on-line or by phone despite numerous attempts over four hours.So I just chucked it and went back to using Streets & Trips 2007!A complete waste of money!"
1,Won't acrivate,"Product won't activate on my desktop machine. Won't run, won't register, nothing. MS says they are working on the problem and will have a solution on 7-10 days. Meanwhile my $$ spent are worth nothing. I wouldn't buy this product if you need to use it right now, it won't work."
2,Don't bother to buy 2008!,"I had older versions and used them on several of MY computers. This version installed on both my laptop (great for travel) and desktop, but when my laptop crashed and I bought a new one, I was not allowed to install a 3rd time. I called tech support and was told I should use all lower case for the key code even when the key code is shown in caps and installed properly the first time using caps. I asked for a supervisor who then told me I was allowed only ONE installation!!!What idiots!! Although I really like Streets and Trips I will no longer upgrade. I have a Garmin and a Dash, so it is not a big issue for me (except that I wasted my money).I am going to install 2008 and go back to 2007."
4,MS Streets 2008,"I have always liked the MS streets and trips software and I get the new version every year. This year, they made it a lot harder to register it and I wish they would just include the registration code so I can use it on my PC and laptop, not single use only. Other then that, it's just what I need."
3,I want to display numerous addresses,"Although this is a good product, I find I get the same results from Google maps and Yahoo maps and didn't have to pay for those. I purchased this for my local citizens watch group for street addresses/names. I can easily get the street names, but can't get multiple addresses on the map. they are only numbered 1-12. I can't even print off what address #1 is. This has not allowed me to use it for this purpose."
3,Streets and trips review,"This product takes up way too much room on my hard drive. I am thinking of uninstalling it and sending it back and rely on the old mapquest. This does make it handy however for routing a tour since I am a real estate agent, but not worth buying a new computer over."
3,Streets and Trips Review,I have been a Microsoft S and T user for 6 years. I was very disappointed with this 2008 version because there was a problem with installation. I had to speak with a respresentative in India in order for him to take control of my computer and find a file to load in order to continue the installation. That should not happen in this day and time from a software giant like Microsoft. It took over an hour on the phone with this representative (he did a great job and was very polite)to get it straight.
2,MS Streets&Trips 2008- Buyer Beware!!,"I replaced the 2004 version with 2008 and was dismayed to find the map does not include a major Interstate extension due to open 11/2008 in Illinois. How can you advertise 2008 and not include a road under construction for 2 years! The live search feature with the various maps is useful, but the aerial views were taken during the summer, most homes are covered by foliage-not useful. I tried to find an e-mail contact to ask about future automatic updates--can't find any. The e-mail shown on the 'about' screen for product is bogus. MicroSoft strikes again with anupgrade to a product that is not worth the cost. It did show some new residential street in town opened since 2004 so it is not a total waste.Consider another product or keep your older Streets&Trips; version."
2,Microsoft Streets & Trips 2008 -- Difficult to activate,"I was able to install and activate the program on my laptop. However, to this date I have not been able to use it on my desktop as it can not be activated despite several tries by Microsoft Support personnel. They are still working on it..I am ready to ask for my money back!"
4,Microsoft Streets and Trips 2008,"Microsoft Streets and Trips 2008 is the best product for mapping and directions for the PC. It works fast and only requires using the DVD once for Express installing. It includes Boro, City, Town, & Village limits and also has a new feature of neighborhood places. It is better Streets and Trips 2007 because it does not freeze up at all. However, most Steets & Trips software take 2 to 3 years to update new streets and traffic patterns."
1,I don't think so !!,"I came to this site specifically to purchase MS Streets and Trips 2008. After learning that I can only use it on one computer, I have changed my mind. Like many working/traveling people, I create my routes, maps etc on a desk top at home and use them on a laptop on the road. The one computer restriction is very inconvenient for me and a deal breaker.I am off to research ""Plan B""Thank you, everyone, for writing the very informative reviews. You have saved me a little money and a lot of hassle."
3,Ho Hummmmm,"Except for those who need to utilize the GPS capability of this program, the only significant differences I have detected so far are the changed version number and the requirement to activate the D@^! thing as per Microsoft's incessant, paranoid reliance on same. This further encroachment on my personal preference is wearing thin enough to drive me and droves of others as far away from Microsoft's products as we can get."
2,Promising but has issues,"My initial experience with S&T 2008 was that the installation program failed with a meaningless error message typical of older era Microsoft products. After that I realized that I needed the product key that came with the software. Activating the MSN Direct Receiver is also problematic telling me that the version of the software doesn't support it. (Huh? They came in the same box!) Online subscription-ware is something that makes life difficult for me. I rely on the GPS capability when traveling and if I have to reinstall on the road this is going to be problematic. Plus, I simply don't like 'activation'. If I could return opened box software I would. I guess this will be the last time I buy S&T."
3,Streets and Trips 2008,"I've used Streets and Trips for 6 or 7 years. Although stated in product write up, this is not a CD format as in the past, but is DVD, which necessitated me purchasing a DVD reader before I could install software. Also, it takes longer to start up the program than previous versions, without a discernible improvement in features or functions. If it were not for wanting to update street locations, I would have preferred keeping old version. Still the best mapping software available."
1,Microsoft Streets & Trips 2008,"I am VERY DISSATISFIED with this package of software. I have used older versions of the same software for years, and needed this new version to plan our trip across the country. But I have installed it twice, and cannot get the software to OPEN. I click, I try commands and cannot open the software to use it. I finally deleted it and reinstalled my 2005 version. Could there be something wrong with this package???????"
1,Bad Software,I have used previous versions of streets and trips without any problems. My home address has been removed from the new version. Don't waste your money on the new version. Stick with 2007 or google maps.
2,Not much better than Yahoo Maps!,It is not worth paying for the same features you get on Yahoo Maps. In the NYC area commercial vehicles are not allowed on the Garden State Parkway or the Holland Tunnel. I thought with this program one could tell it to avoid those routes. This program cannot do that. Our company just spent almost $40.00 on software that is no more functinal than Yahoo Maps. The only thing that is nice is that there are no ads.
1,Microsoft Streets & Trips 2008,Excellent product. Many updates since the 2007 version. Very user friendly. I give it 5 stars.
1,It destroyed my registry,"-The program caused my computer to shut down. When I rebooted the system this is the message I got:""Your registry settings for this application were not copied correctly. To correct these settings, run setup again for this application from the location where you originally installed it.""and the program would not run.I reinstalled the program (repair option) and it still would not run.Apparently Microsoft knows of this condition. I found the procedure to correct the error in the Microsoft self help database. It would have taken me three hours to run their procedure and you have to be a conmputer guru to run the install program in ""clean boot"" mode.Stay away from this program. DON'T BUY IT. I have reinstalled the 2007 version.Joeph F. HehirRoswell, GA"
1,Bluetooth gps issue,When using this software with a bluetooth gps receiver I'm getting a screen to actual position lag time of greater than 15 seconds - which just about makes this product worthless. I've duplicated this issue on 2 different laptops. My bluetooth gps device works just fine with Delorme Street Atlas 2007 - so I have to put the fault with Streets and Trips 2008. Customer support for S&T 2008 was inane.
1,Microsoft Streets & Trips,"Microsoft Streets and Trips 2008I have used this product for years, but I had to return it because it could'nt be activated by Microsoft. After installing I couln'tget the requied code because it wouln't load and show the code. I triedreinstalling to no avail. I'm still using the 2007 version. Does anyone know of a soloution? Microsoft site was of no help."
1,Not worth the upgrade,There is no real improvement in functionality since MSS&T 2007 and I also did not notice any map updates in my area. What is worse is the new activation scheme as I need a copy on my laptop and my desktop. But what me let return my MSS&T 2008 version to the store was the problem with the GPS tracking. The NMEA connection was dropped after working typically just 1 to 2 minutes. This happened with my Magellan as well as the Microsoft GPSr that I bought together with MSS&T 2007. I re-installed MSS&T 2007 and it is working flawlessly again.
1,I could never get the program to work,"I purchased Microsoft Streets and Trips 2008 in September 2007. I could never get the program to work. It would load correctly but then not kick off. It seems to have something to do with my VirusScan program or a tool from Cisco called CSA - Cisco Security Agent. I talked to Microsoft support for 2 hours one day trying to get it resolved then they would not talk to me again.I finally reached a supervisor who told me it was known problem and that ""Prashant"" was working the issue. I was able to load it on my Desktop computer at home but since I want to use the program for long distance motorcycle riding it's tough to carry my desktop PC on the road.I would recommend that you find an earlier version of this program and avoid Microsoft Streets and Trips 2008."
1,Microsoft Streets,I've have at least 4 other versions and they were great. This one has an error in setup and won't load. Their support website is pathetic. I would be better off buying another copy than spending $40 worth of time to try and solve it. My time isn't worth much an hour either.
3,"good, but not perfect","I purchased this edition to upgrade from the 2006 edition. As is typical, ""up-to-date"" means the data is about two years old. My subdivision, created in the summer of 2006, is not indicated in any way. Several new portions of interstate 40 near Greensboro were opened last year - under construction for four years - and are not included, while a segment of I-73 that has not even been started is shown as complete.I don't use GPS, so I can't comment on it. The thre D maps are interesting and can be useful."
4,Good intro to stenography and its uses.,"I found this book to be interesting both as a fiction and technical material. The plot develops around a very hot topic of these days - the war on terrorism. Unlike your ""conventional"" terrorists, the characters in this book use Internet and computer technology to secretly plan and launch an attack against the US.The tools discussed in this book were new to me, although I've heard of something similar in the past. I found it difficult at times to adjust to this interesting combination of suspense fiction and the technical explanations of how certain tools work. However, overall information obtained is quite useful and encouraged me to further research the topic of ""covert channels"" and stenography. Besides a few grammar errors and typos that were missed by the editors, this is a good introduction to stenography, especially for computer enthusiasts and professionals. If you are looking for a page turner fiction novel you may want to look somewhere else."
1,"Terrible story, no plot, poorly researched","How to write a book and make money: Find the hot topic of the day - today's is terrorism, put in your own pet theory or idea about the topic - the author's is how terrorists can use steganography to communicate and finally write a lot of fluff to combine the two. The author has written a poor story, thrown in liberal screenshots and lengthy explanation of how they work.The author knows enough about steganography but know little about the terrorists and their culture. Of course, today any fool can sell a book about ""terrorism"" and most do."
3,"Good topic, bad presentation","Hacking a Terror Network is a good book about an interesting topic.but it does not work so well as a novel, and is very wordy."
5,Quite simply the Sharpest Lens...,Oh my goodness...what a lens! This is such an awesome lens. I wrote a review for the 35mm and said that it was the sharpest lens Canon made but oh god was i wrong. This lens is so darn sharp at all stops. It focuses so quickly and takes the most insane photos. It is a little heavy and you will draw a few looks carrying it around. I went to Yellowstone with this attached to my 5D Markii that already had a grip and people were literally staring at me and pointing. It felt a bit strange. Anyway the quality of the build is the best you can get. It is expensive but really worth the price. You will not regret it at all. It works great with the extender 1.4x. To see some of my shots with it go to my site:[...]Hope this was useful.
4,Mmmm... big glass,"Love the Mark 2 version of this lens. 'Sweet' ain't the word folks.Tack sharp image. Ultra-fast precision focus.Totally hand-holdable, even with a gripped DSLR.Get it.Now."
3,Mystic card games disc,"I enjoyed the card games, but, it doesn't compare with the Hoyle Games I had on my other MAC and wasn't able to order a newer version of it for my MAC PRO laptop, specifically, there aren't any rules for all the games offered, at least I can't find the access to them on this disc. Therefore I really wouldn't recommend this game set to my card playing nerds, of which I have plenty. I do enjoy playing the 3-4 games, tho, that I already know the rules for but, learning to play the others was not possible."
1,While the $5.95 sale price seemed a like a good deal....,"If you want a wide variety of games, customizable avitars, a roster of lively personalities for computer opponents, and well programmed animations, then buy Hoyle's card games. The Masque set has none of the above. I bought it only because of the game 'whist,' and was very disappointed to find that Masque's version is not Bid Whist, but an older game that has no bidding options. Besides this annoyance, the program does not make use of niceties that today's gamers are accustomed to. And so while the $5.95 sale price seemed like a good deal, it was more money than I would have spent for a game that will not be played again."
3,saw blade,Very good product very good investment for my prodject. Im very happy i found and bought this item. Good item for my project makes me proud to have found this
5,handsaw blade,"Since the purchase from target was missing this blade, I was glad to find it on Amazon. This blade was the reason I purchase it but didn't open the Target purchase when it arrived until I needed it. Thank you Amazon dealer."
1,Wood cutting blade,I was very dissappointed in the blade. I used it to cut some dead limbs and it cut really slow and not very large limbs either. I would hate to think how long it would take to cut a 2x4. I guess it would be alright for really soft wood or really small limbs and not oak and as long as you are not in a hurry. I would not recomend this blade save your money and use it to buy a good wood saw.
3,Limited choice of blades serious drawback.,"The available blades for the Black & Decker Navigator electric handsaw are ok for the applications that these blades are designed for, but for heavy-duty cutting more aggressive blades are needed--especially for cutting thick tree trunks & limbs. It would help greatly if the Navigator were redesigned to allow using commonly available saber-saw blades."
1,This Company Sucks,"The company that offers this item said that they were out of this item and didn't know when they would have more, all the while it still showed avail. on they're website. So I had to choose some ""plain jane"" cell case. Very Disappointed!!!! I will never buy from this company again."
3,Not bad....,"I like many of Wyckoff's boys mystery fiction written mostly back in the 1930s. I would say that this one is a sort of middle of the road story for Wyckoff. Another camping expedition, like so many other of his stories but the mystery wasn't as fulfilling as In the Camp of the Black Rider or The North Point Cabin Mystery. Its not his best, but worth the read if you're into Capwell Wyckoff's work.Pirate Treasure of Cape May"
2,"Nice looking, not Long Lasting!","Fun to wear, with socks expect to wedge your sock, without I never got splinters. They look nice, but they won't last long outside. Small rocks EASILY stick into the soft lite wood leaving holes. The wood is so soft that someone wore mine outside, walked down concrete steps with them and tore off part of the back. Use these for inside use or costume use only, VERY delicate!!!"
3,Good for show.,"I bought these geta for about 25 bucks, real cheap! I wore them three times and the hanao (the black straps) came loose. It wasn't fun walking back to my car barefoot. After a quick fix, I've only worn them on special occasions. They do like the other reviewer said collect small rocks in the bottom. They haven't splintered on me yet, and if you wear them when it gets wet out they get water stains real easy.But if your looking for a really good pair of geta, and your willing to spend the money on them, I'd suggest going to www.karankoron.com where they specialize in hand-made geta. The pair I ordered from there were about 50 dollars and you could wear them anywhere, plus you can get the option to have rubber put on the bottom for extra slip protection.However, if your just looking for a cheap, impress your friends pair of geta, then go with these. Its all on your preference but remember, all geta are fun to walk on!"
4,It's worth it...,"One of the previous reviewers said they wore these outside and tore them up, I completely believe that. The wood really is fairly soft, but they are much cheaper than good Geta's, I actually got these to see if they were worth it. They are fairly comfortable albeit a bit strange to walk in... Definitely worth $20 before you try something more expensive."
1,"Looks Great, But don't wear it!","I love Japanese culture I bought this because I thought it would look great, But I don't recommend anyone to buy it. You will get splinters from it and the wood is so cheap and if you hit something it breaks easy. Not to mention that it is made in china and the size I ordered came smaller! Would I buy again? NO, at least not this kind or from this supplier."
4,Navigator accessories,"I was pleased to find this (hard to find) item as the Navigator is not one of the more useful tools, though useful at times, and it may even be a discontinued item."
1,Wrong photo for item,the photo shown is the wide wood-cutting blade when the actual item received is the thin stick-like metal cutting blade with smaller teeth.
4,Fits great,"This filter fit my 2001 Subaru Outback 2.5L perfectly. The black painted (powdercoated?) finish is nice, and seems to resist gasoline (as it should!).The only issue I noticed is that the inlet tube dust cap was split when the filter arrived. It was possible for dirt or other particles to get in while being stored or shipped. However, it was the inlet side so it doesn't matter. The dust caps are discarded before installation."
1,Save your money,"After 1 month of use, it stopped working. I threw it in the trash. Spend more money and buy the Cuisinart."
3,General and non technical,"I'm a computer services manager working in local government, so I am probably not part of the target audience for this book.This book will give maximum benefit to a non-technical person who knows nothing about on-line collaboration. The book is effective in giving a survey of the conferencing products and services available on the market at the time of publication.Here is my description of my ""wish list"" for a book on Web Conferencing:1. Target audience: Information systems professionals2. Detailed coverage of network issues involved with Web conferencing, including bandwidth, infrastructure and security issues.3. Cost structure for each product reviewed.4. Some coverage of manipulating low cost configurations to provide high levels of service. (How to do more with less).5. Professional, rather than chatty, tone."
1,Poor synchronization,It would appear that the makers of these DVDs were unaware that movie film needs a specific length of film leading to the sound decoder. Most of the audio is out of sync.
1,DISSATISFIED CUSTOMER,"I ordered a video, W. C. Fields, Golf Specialist/Dentist/Fatal Glass of Beer, in October 2001. I paid for the video by check. The estimated shipping date was October 4-10, 2001. I have not received the video yet."
2,Hall of Fame pitcher Fegie Jenkins,"This is a children's book. There isn't a whole lot here about the game at all. I was expecting to hear a Hall of Famer give insights into pitching a ballgame, but instead got chapters on the equiptment (this is a glove, this is a cap, etc....). Not bad for the 8 and under crowd, but that's abouot as far as this one goes."
4,Good 31 pound stroller,"my favorite site said it all about this :The Zooper Boogie is a good stroller. A really nice stroller. Some parents adore their Boogie. So you decide. How do you feel about a stroller with loads of great features (like a reversible seat, winter boot, rain cover, tire pump, glare protector, and fully adjustable sun canopy) as well as a snazzy design, solid build, and those great 12 inch air-filled tires for any terrain and a front-swivel-locking wheel? Sounds good eh? Okay, well, how do you feel about a stroller that weighs more than many double strollers and can hardly fit in the back of an SUV when folded down? Finally, how do you feel about a stroller that has screws and other minor components rusting within the first six months of purchase? You decide what it's worth and see if the price tag you have in your head matches the one on the Boogie."
5,"Tender, comic, lyrical pointillism","J.P. Donleavy's narrative voice is unique. Setting him apart from all other writers. With a lyrical pointillism that is fragmented. Painting pictures of incredible poetic beauty. Sad and tender. And then, again, hilarious. Evoking all of one's senses. This tale is very New York. Where Donleavy was born. Before moving to Ireland, TCD and the Irish countryside. His subject, this time, is a starving composer living among wealthy friends and in-laws. Tormented by every woman he meets. Unable to understand just one of them. Even briefly. Bewildered by popular American culture. Which rains fortunes on untalented artists. Hiding the gifted in total obscurity. And starving them into anonymity. They await redemption. And recognition of their artistic merit. As the astonishing talents of Donleavy go unrecognized by the literary mainstream. Read Donleavy -- one of the most gifted and worthy and unheralded writers of our day."
3,Not ready yet...,"I purchased this product and spent countless hours trying to establish the VPN connection throgh the firewall. Turns out that the VPN tunnel does not work, if you enable the firewall. The Linksys support mentioned to me that they became aware of it few weeks ago. I guess it wasn't tested properly before it was released to public. Good thing is that the VPN does work. I am using Windows 2000 client for my testing."
5,Great Router for Business use - Updated,"The router is very robust and will handle a good size network to ISP connection.I have this router installed in 2 locations now.It's great for businesses that may want to add a second ISP for added speed, bandwith or reliability.The installation is not for beginners. Make sure you have someone who knows what they are doing install it.I did have the opportunity to talk to Cisco Small Business support. They were extremely helpfull.Currently we have a Comcast Cable ISP.I am adding a second ISP now (probably Verizon FIOS) and will use the load balancing built into the router.UPDATE:I was having problems with both restarting on thier own. I downloaded the firmware from the Cisco site, installed it on both routers and they are both working perfectly now.Based on experience and conversations with the helpful support team, this will fix most problems with this router."
4,Item was easy to setup and is working very well.,I purchased this item since it was given a good review. I would have preferred if it were a Cisco/Cisco product and not a Cisco/Linksys item. I spent very little time getting it working and the client is happy. I would recommend it to anyone. I have not used the software that came with the unit to create vpn's from portable computers.... thats next.
4,Rock Solid,"Our medical clinic have recently went live with Electronic Medical Records System. We utilize a hosted solution, so a solid VPN connection with the host was critically important. We started out using a Syswan Dual WAN router. It was awful, the connection was down every other day if we were lucky. We switched to this router, the connection has been solid since the first week of November. Our tunnel went down only once, because the local data center went down in a storm. Within 10 min. we were up again with a back up DataCenter. I have been able to stop worrying about the connection, a big plus in my book. I just set up another of these at home and have enjoyed similar experience for the last 2 weeks."
2,Disappointed!,"I purchased Linksys RV082 based on hardware specs, price and ease of configuration with Linksys products. I was hoping that we will get faster performance for our office users that need to VPN into our customer's VPN network.Good part is that hardware seems solid and well built with a fast processor and enough memory.Bad part is that software does not seem to be ready. All I wanted RV082 to do was to share a small office DSL connection from Verizon Online with Static IP address. The unit works fine in my home with dynamic IP Address.I could not get the unit to work with Static IP address. I did upgrade the firmware to 1.07. I called Linksys technical support and they were not able to help.I also have sub $100 Linksys routers that work fine with static IP address in my office. So, I do not think there is a problem with our DSL line or configuration (which is relatively simple).I am hoping that Linksys will test RV082 for simple test cases first and then for complex configurations."
2,"Okay router, Poor VPN client and documentation","Last year I was in the market for a VPN solution for my home office and after reading some mixed reviews I bought the RV082. The dual WAN, IPSec VPN, firewall and price were the features that sold me and as a relatively savvy VPN user, I figured I could tough it out. Boy was I wrong. This device delivers decent router performance but I couldn't get the QuickVPN software to work at all with Vista clients. The documentation is incomplete and is especially not useful for those who're new to VPN administration. Even after hours of research online and numerous tech support calls I still couldn't get the QuickVPN working, so I gave up on it and switched to another, more configurable IPSec VPN application. This did get the VPN going, and it seems stable so far, but it's annoying and disappointing that it wouldn't work right out of the box."
1,Horrible Speed Drop,"I bought this router for the Cisco name and for the ""business class"" reputation. When I got it the my broadband speed dropped from 16G to 4. I called tech support and did the normal firmware update, testing, etc. Nothing they did helped. They offered to send me a new one but the RMA's aren't new so beware. They are refurbished ones the tech said. I didn't want someone else's problem so I elected a refund. Stay away from this router"
1,QuickVPN doesn't work,"I bought this router to replace my Netgeart FVS318 that was fried when we got hit by lightning. The VPN utility that came with that was too hard for the average user to configure, so the Linksys and QuickVPN utility looked good. Unfortunately the QuickVPN doesn't work, and spent quit a lot of time with Linksys tech support and still no luck. So if you're looking at this for the ease of VPN with QuickVPN, you may want to consider something else."
1,RV082 JUNK !,"I bought this for the purpose of the dual wan connection , it started loosing internet connectivity off and on , contacted Cisco and they were no help . Now i am trying to get it replaced under the 3 year warranty but Cisco is stalling , sad this is condsidered a buisness level router and after a year the problems started .. all i can say is dont buy this router JUNK JUNK JUNK"
5,Great Small Office VPN Router,"The RV082 is the main router for a network of 7 PCs, a network file server, a networked printer/copier, and two wireless routers at church.- It's very stable. It runs months at a time with no problem.- Supports Windows VPN client. Very useful as I can do remote support from home, from remote airports, and at times from overseas.- Supports allocation of fixed IP addresses via DHCP. Very helpful for providing remote support via remote desktop or VNC.- Provides a local DNS database and lookup.- Straightforward web administration.With only one WAN connection in use (via cable modem), I haven't needed the second WAN port."
5,Works well and good price for a Cisco product,"I helped a friend to setup a company network with this router. They use 4G Clear as their primary internet, but it's not very stable, and needed a solution that can fall back to 2nd internet. They also have a T1 internet that is shared with 8 phone lines, which is quite slow but very stable. So i used this Cisco router to setup dual wan, 4G as primary, when it fails, T1 takes over. It's been a few months and no problem so far, they loved it."
2,non stop problems,"Hellowe bought this router a couple of months ago, the IT guy took hours to get to accept the IP address which was the first clue something was wrong. then it would randomly drop network computors and not allow them to access files, and the latest is it dropped the IP and wont accept it.what a piece of junk this router is"
4,Love it!,"Best router I've owned to date. Very stable, no power cycling twice a day like my old router. Stays strong even with 30+ connected devices (via multiple switches). The only thing I wish was better is the load balancing between the two wan ports. Internet seems to go slower so I just have one set as a backup connection."
1,DONT WASTE A PENNY ON THIS ONE!!,THIS WAS ABSOLUTELY THE WORST MOVIE I MIGHT HAVE EVER SEEN..IF THEY PAID THESE ACTORS MORE THAN $20.00 EACH..THAT MEANS THEY WERE OVERPAID..SAVE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ONE!!!
4,"entertaining, fun stuff","Hey,It seems people are giving negative reviews of this movie but I enjoyed it. I love micro budget movies and this movie kept me entertained. If you enjoy fun, micro budget horror movies I think you should give this one a chance."
3,Desk Ref,"This book is not exactly what I have thought it would be. Not that it's a bad book, I wasn't sure what info was exactly on there and some info I could easily type in google for faster result. A lot of info I did not care for like roof rafter span, but there is info on this book and I will discover more as I need to look through book. great book for one without internet acess certainly."
3,"An ""okay"" book on tape","To be honest, it's not quite a book on tape. Rather, it is a dramatization of a L'Amour short story - multiple actors, sound effects and so on. It is performed pretty well, but the story is just so-so, in my opinion.Chick Bowdrie, the main character, is too perfect. He can outshoot everyone, he can out-think and out-track everyone and he is never wrong. He got pretty irritating after a while. I was glad this was a short story (about one hour in length). It was better than not listening to anything at all, but towards the end I was tired of Bowdrie.I give this story a C."
1,:(,I cant belive i spent $50 on this book !! this book is for the very new trader (and i mean NEW) it is filled with cliche 1. trend is your friend2. cut losses let profits run.....ect If you are a serious trader then look elsewhere....sorry
4,Nice way to get more use from your S330 Digital Elph,"If you'd like to use your Canon S330 for underwater photography, then you need this waterproof housing from Canon that's made specifically to fit the Digital Elph S330 camera.The case offers access to all of the camera's controls and allows you to take underwater photos down to 100 feet (compared to the 20-30 feet most disposable ""underwater"" cameras offer).I used this case with my S330 in the Bahamas and took several good photos. However, do be aware that the case doesn't provide for an external strobe of any sort (not that the S330 works with one anyway), which means you'll need good lighting to get decent photos.I also do recommend very strictly following its instructions for use to prevent leaks, including testing out in a bucket or shallow water and immediately rinsing / cleaning the case after a swim or dive. I had no problems whatsoever after using the case on several dives in 20-30 feet of water."
2,Warning for Jean fans this is not up to his usual caliber.,"This movie is just not good. The plot is overly simply and uninteresting. Jean is usually such a good director it is very hard to imagine what happened here. I don't usually write reviews but I thought it was necessary here. Fans of Jean beware this is not him at his best or at any level really. If you have to see it rent it but this is not a movie to see more than once, if even that. I would simply recommend skipping the experience in it's entirety. I tried to make myself like it and really wanted to but there is nothing there.Another reviewer mentioned Fantastic Mr.Fox. This film is nothing like that. The plot involves trying to take down arms dealers. That's not really comparable to fighting to survive or steal from farmers. Ignore that comparison."
1,What a bunch of crap.,"Come on guys. Of all the great stories out there to be toldand you choose to spend money on this crap. Who the helllost their mind?If you have a life, at all, don't waste your money and timethat you can't get back on this."
4,The Latest Favorite,"I have been a fan of the films of Jean-Pierre Jeunet since I first saw ""Delicatessen"" and ""City of Lost Children"" years ago. I confess I fail to understand what his detractors find to hold against his work. ""Micmacs"" did little business in American theaters. It played so briefly in my town that I missed it entirely and had to wait for the DVD release to see it at all. I rented it, and was delighted with its wacky inventiveness, and the great detail work which I associate with Jeunet. I bought it at once."
4,Enlightning,This was a very easy going movie and done with very good taste. It was funny in just the right amounts. Just like the old days where we of the middle age generation considered a well made movie.Two thumbs up!
4,micmacs a great story!,"Another great film by Jean-Pierre Jeunet! He takes the audience on a wonderful ride,following Bazil through this tumultuous adventure. One of the reasons I liked this movie, and his others,is the way his movies look. He has a special talent for the use of color, his films are pleasing to the eye. Its almost like watching candy on the screen. Micmacs is a montage of wonderful characters, good and evil. A film any one can enjoy."
3,It's all whipped topping - but really good whipped topping.,"Quirky, funny, charming with tremendous visual style, but not much substance. It's all whipped topping - but really good whipped topping."
5,Elgar Compositions,"These two compositions are simply terrific. They immediately become some of my favorite Elgar works. In addition, the performers are wonderful and the recording is excellent."
5,Sears Craftsman 61LM Garage Door Remote,"Bought this so my girlfriend would also have a remote for my Sears Craftsman 41A4207 garage door receiver.What else can I say other than it works? It came with a battery.Other than that, as the directions say, don't change the position of the 1st switch. You only need to make switches 2 through 9 match your current remote.Did I mention that the remote works? I think that's all that matters with this sort of product."
1,Excellent company,2nd garage door opener I purchased from company. From their website to the delivery of unit everything was handled in an excellent manner.
5,Chamberlain 750 CB,I ordered two of the Chamberlain 750CB remotes for use with an older model Master Mechanic garage door opener. The remotes arrived quickly and worked perfectly after I set the dip switches to match the old transmitter. The product even arrived with a battery. Thank-you.
3,OK,Ordered this for my son who bought a house but previous owners took remote.Door opens fine with wall switch but will not work with remote. Tried both this one and Security + with no luck.
2,"Pedestrian, Touristy Fair","The recipes in the book are like the food at the restaurant. Geared far more toward tourists who think they know New Orleans cooking, but only know the clichés. You'll rarely see a local in the restaurant, and I doubt you'll ever find the book on the shelf of a Louisiana kitchen. A poor comparison to the restuarants of the Brennans and Alex Patout. I recommend buying the cookbooks from The Commander's Palace or the Palace Café over this collection."
5,IF YOU CAN'T VISIT THE RESTAURANT TRY THE BOOK,"This was a gift and the recipient was very pleased.I did search for a hard back book, but only found soft cover.For anyone who visits New Orleans, this is a great restaurant and the book would make a nice way to reflect back on your visit as well as trying the recipes."
5,Great memories of a favored restaurant,I first ate at the Gumbo Shop over 25 years ago. The food and atmosphere reminded of my grandmothers kitchen in Baton Rouge.This book helped me reconnect.
5,Gumbo Shop Cookbook,"I was motivated to write this review when I read another review from a person in Alexandria, VA, who said the recipes and the restaurant was for tourists and that a native from Louisiana would never use it. I was born and raised in Louisiana and my mother was raised in New Orleans. I have tested almost every recipe in this book and 90% of them are, in my opinion, fabulous. This is how my grandmother's dishes tasted when I was a little girl. It's the real thing, not gourmet, but how many ""normal"" people are gourmet cooks? After family and friends sample a recipe, they either ask how they can get the cookbook or ask for the recipe. I've purchased around 10 as gifts. In fact, that's why I was on the site today... buying another copy!"
5,"Tasteful and tantelizing tour of New Orleans through ""Gumbo""","A Great read in addition to some of the purest and most delicious secret recipes ever made available. This is a masterpiece on the evolution of just what makes a New Orleanian and Southerner, well, unique, through Food. It is why we 'live to eat'!"
4,Good Vegetarian Options,"Having visited the Gumbo Shop in New Orleans I just had to get the recipe for their Gumbo Z'herbs. It was awesome at the restaurant and almost awesome when I followed the recipe. I guess a recipe doesn't make you a great chef. Anyway, the pictures are wonderful and almost all of the recipes are easy to follow with great results."
4,Solid workout,"Cathe delivers, as usual!I am a fan of Cathe, but this is actually the 1st DVD of hers I have purchased. I have some of her Exercise TV shows saved to my DVR. Her DVDs tend to be a little bit pricier than most, so it has taken me a while to bite the bullet.Cathe offers a solid workout, and she is engaging and informational. I get a little distracted by the constant changes between dumbbells, barbell and other equipment, and I would really appreciate if she could offer options for some of the equipment as I do not own every single thing she uses. Despite these issues, I enjoyed the workout. Working out to Cathe and her group always makes me feel like some sort of athlete, and I look forward to the challenge."
5,awesome workout,"Cathe's Muscle Max offers a great workout if you prefer to exercise at home and have some equipment. I have a padded bench (v/s a step and it works just fine), adjustable dumbbells and a band. That's all that's needed for this full body workout. This DVD offers a full length routine (60+ min)as well as a shorter version if you have less avaiable time. I have bought other Cathe DVDs and am not disappointed. I followed Cathe's workouts on FITTV before buying this DVD, so I knew what to expect. Cathe's workouts are challenging and not for those who won't put work into a fitness routine."
5,The First Hebrew Primer,"I'm 47 and hadn't studied Hebrew in 30 years. This is a great review with a good pace of learnig, reviews and exercises. I think I'd get a lot of out of it even if I were a rank beginner, but it's helps to have learned Hebrew in childhood."
3,20 year old 3rd edition,"I bought this book for a hebrew class. Everyone else in the class also has the exact same Title. The difference is, the book I bought is a 20 year old edition. Wouldn't be a problem except that there are no chapter help notes in the back of my 20 year old edition as there are in the newer ""same"" edition. I would expect that when something important changes in a current edition, that the Publisher would then print an updated edition; in this case, a 4th edition would have been in order. I do highly reccommend the book, it is an excellent tool for learning Biblical Hebrew. However make sure if you are buying a used edition, that you check the year it was printed - at least the 2007 edition."
4,KLC says Great,I found the primer to be very helpful and easy to follow. But feel that the companion CDs should be offered as a companion product and sold as a set instead of separate. I had to buy both to get the full benefit.
5,Great for the Beginning Biblical Hebrew Student,"The First Hebrew Primer, Third Edition is an excellent textbook for the beginning Biblical Hebrew student. The Aleph-Bet and vowel points are presented in a logical manner and each section has good practice exercises to reinforce what was just presented."
5,Good for self-study,Material is introduced at a good pace and is presented clearly. The Answer Book is a must. Readings consist of simple stories and simplified excerpts from the book of Ruth.
2,Disappointment,"I really love the first hebrew primer and was excited to order it, but the used copy I bought which was described as being in ""very good"" condition is a mess. There is writing on almost every page and coffee stains all over the pages. Needless to say I am very disappointed."
3,Nice at first,"These were nice right out of the package, but as soon as I washed them, they shrank. The pants and the jacket are now too short. Very disappointed, because they seemed so nice at first. The shrinking even occurred without drying them in a dryer!"
5,Mom loved it!,She said the color is beautiful and the fabric is ultra soft. She said it looks like elegent nightware.
3,I've had better,Not what I expected. My past experience with Royal type products was better than this one.
3,Wedgits Starter Set Cards..,"The designs on these cards required many more wedgies than are included in the started kit. We found them to be of no help at this time. Should we purchase more sets of wedgies, I think they could be quite helpful. We will hang on to them for future use."
3,I'm a little confused.,"When I first listened to this CD, I said to myself ""wow this is really awesome"". Then I realized that my CD player was not on repeat, and the whole CD was basically over. Simply put, every song sounds the same in structure and simplicity. However, I'm hooked. Talent wise, Skylines blows."
2,How the heck does this thing go together?,"I got mine last week and was upset that it does not come with instructions as how it goes together. I called Tenba and they said they do not have instructions or photos or illustration as to how this thing is suppose to attach. I've never owned a rain cover or ever used one before so without a base of refference I'm lost. I can take a guess, but when it comes to protecting my gear, I don't take chances. I have sent out emails to everyone I know to see if anyone has this cover and if they can send me a photo or anything showing how it attaches. If I don't get something in a few day, I will be sending it back.Ace was great, they got it shipped to me FAST, I have no complaints with them"
4,Very useable rain cover,"I have purchased and used the Tenba rain cover for my Canon 600D (with both the 50-250mm and 18-55mm kit lens and a 50mm lens).While the 14"" was too long to cover the 50mm without being a pain to also use the controls (as expected), the rain cover was perfect for the rest of the camera and lens combos.I have found this to be excellent in both heavy rain and intermittant (where removal and replacement of the rain cover was needed urgently).There is a slight compromise in comfort when using the rain cover and while the plastic window allows the use of the LCD screen where needed. I found that lifting it slightly still gave me protection from the driving rain and allowed me to get my eye right on the viewfinder.I suspect a small adjustment to the design to allow part of the window (maybe a smaller window over the viewfinder itself) to be opened easily and velcro'ed closed would assist this."
4,Great daily leadership challenge!,"The Heart Of A Leader is another great book by Ken Blanchard. This book could be considered an easy, one-sitting read. Each set of facing pages contains a leadership quote followed by a breif illustration or commentary to amplify it. However, I think its full value will not be realized unless they are read no more than one per day or per week, allowing time for application. I would recommend reading it slowly and making concrete plans to implement the powerful truths so concisely shared on each page."
5,Excellent,"Ken Blanchard surely knows what he's teaching. Some people can only take the words, but Ken Blanchard not only took the words, instead he elaborated them and re-defined them into greater values.If you want to learn practical values of leadership, this book is a must."
5,Blanchard Summary,"Excellent pocket book on small to medium-sized business leadership. The beauty of this book's format is that the reader need only read one page per day to get a great impact. The book is set up so that the reader can view an inspirational quote on the left page and a summary of one of Blanchard's many books on the right page. If desired, the reader can spend only a few minutes per day on one particular subject. In addition, the summary of the particular philosophy discussed includes the name of the book from which the summary came. This allows the reader, if interested, to refer to the book referenced in order to get a more in-depth view of what is being discussed. This is a great book to give as a gift to those business leaders who have not experienced all of Blanchard's philosophies."
5,Good Advice,"I purchased the e-book of ""Heart of a Leader."" The book is chock full of great tips for a variety of situations with the justification for each tip. It is an excellent reference for any supervisor or manager."
3,Hamilton Beach Electronic Iron,"Hamilton Beach 14360 Electronic Control Stainless Steel Iron I wanted an iron that would make ironing less of a chore. I liked the design of the iron but found the iron heavy. The cord rewind was a nice feature but added to the weight. The iron definately did a nice job and if it wern't for my needing a light weight iron, I would have kept it.I loved the digital controls so when I decided on another iron, digital controls was one option I stayed with."
5,"This book is the closest you will get to ""the cure""","Years ago I read this book after the break up with my first girlfriend. I was able to let go and move on with my life in a couple months.Then I had another girlfriend and broke up, but did not read the book or apply the techniques. I thought about her for years.Now I am reading the book again after the break up of a 7 year relationship. I feel so much better after following the advice in Letting Go. This book is the closest thing to a cure for a broken heart.Thanks Dr. Tracy and Dr. Wanderer!"
2,"Clinical, not spiritual, a little tough to read","I've read a lot of break up books since my break up. This book was helpful, but not sure if it actually helped me? Anyway, I found 2 sites...one for girls and for guys that ended up helping me because of the support groups. brokenheartedgirl.com and brokenheartedguy.com. Sometimes you need to talk to people and they also recommend other books."
1,A major disappointment,"This book focused more on how to handle a new relationship once you've gotten over a relationship than how to recover from a break up. Though the book did offer a few useful tips on how to handle the early crisis days, it was a disappointment to discover that the authors were more focused on new relationships. I have read much better books on coping with the pain of lost love, and I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone trying to overcome one."
1,secular vs spiritual,"If you are a spiritual person this is NOT the book for you!!! Some suggestions include casual sex, smoking pot, acting as if you are someone else, wearing clevage showing clothes, putting Hustler and Playboy on the coffee table, watching Deep Throat,whispering ""I feel like I'm being raped"" in your lover's ear, you get the picture ! I found myself laughing out loud. They can't be serious. Get yourself a book on meditation instead !!!"
3,Good Advice but WAY too clinical for most,While the advice in the book is good overall - It's written so clinically that the average reader has to take more time than they should to put it in to practice -As always the oldest adage is best - Time heals all wounds...
3,VERY ACCURATE BUT EXTREMELY SIMPLE,"This book deals with the most practical points of view one can observe from a broken heart state of mind. However, just this psicologist can believe you can have relief in 12 weeks. That is the most ridiculous, simplistic and childish ( also mercantile oriented ) I have noticed from this book. The way he passes from stage to stage is just too fast, too unreal."
2,Letting Go,It seemed tangenial and non-specific bit not as good and detailed as the other books I have read on this subject for my group. It seemed to go to generalities that we/they have already discussed. It gave no new inside and steps that could/would help.
5,Shocking and Necessary,"It's hard to believe that companies and individuals can still get away with this extraordinarily misogynist behavior, but Murphy and Graff have done the legwork and the math to prove not only that they do, but how they do it and how we can begin to put an end to it. This book should be mandatory reading for anyone who is or loves a woman or girl and believes that women should be treated with basic human decency (and paid that way, too)."
1,This book debases the progress of women,"I make just as much, if not more than a man because I make the same sacrifices a man makes to earn this money. If you cry baby girls want to make money than don't have babies, don't get into a relationship that doesn't allow you to travel, work long hours, and relocate. I'm sick of women who want it all then complain about it to everyone who don't care. To all you cry babies, stop crying and start working like a man."
5,Wow and more wow,"This book--When God is silent"" by Ronald Dunn is a masterful and brutally honest exposition of what to do when God is silent,and your attitude towards it.Although the author makes a huge error concerning KJV italics on page 83,he has rare insight into this matter (because of personal experience) and really does answer the question of what to do when ""God is silent"" and why He may be silent."
5,Best Shampoo-Body Soap made!,"I've used Prell Concentrate for 40-years. It works for most everything...you can wash your hair with it, your body...even as a general handsoap if you want. It is actuallY CONCENTRATED, so a little goes a LONG WAY. It is affordable, too...so it is even MORE AFFORDABLE, actually, than about any comparison you can offer. It is a clean soap that doesn't leave a film, it works AWESOME when camping or outdoor living, and it packs VERY WELL (just like a big toothpaste tube). You can pour it into a nalgene bottle for better packing, or just leave it like it is. I really like it as a guy, because it is one of the few soaps that do it all, and can be conveniently fit into your travel/shaving kit. A must have, if you are a hunter, camper, or outdoor enthusiast! Doesn't have a heavy-odor, like a lot of other things do, either."
5,why do we need new versions when the old version works so well?,This version of Prell always makes my hair squeaky clean on the first shampoo. I love that the container is not big and clunky and so it fits in my little shower.
3,50 yrs.,"I've loved Prell shampoo since I was a little girl 50 years ago and was glad to purchase it again after not being able to find it in any stores. However, the shipping and handling made the cost of the Prell way too high."
2,Still Lame Over 20 Years Later,"This album is terrible. Cheesy songs! ""Naked Eyes"", ""Hungry for Love""... hello? WTF -- I remember how we all anticipated this follow up to their self-titled debut. Complete shock when Night of the Crime"" came out. Icon sold out big time on their sophomore release and it didn't work. Radio completely ingnored it. I think I heard ""Whites of Their Eyes"" on KUPD once. And that was it for this stinker of an album. It was quickly forgotten.Their self-titled debut,Icon, rocked! It was one of my faves from 1984. But Night of the Crime is a bore. Save your money unless you're a diehard 80's rock collector."
5,Overlooked Masterpiece!,"Icon was a great band that somehow fell through the cracks during the 80s metal years (I just recently discovered them myself). This CD combines Dokken-style guitars (Dan Wexler can give George Lynch a run for his money) with possibly Europe-style vocals. Almost every song on here is a keeper! Try to find their out of print 3rd album, ""Right Between the Eyes"" if you like this one. It's at least as good as this!"
2,Big disappointment,"The product description said this book would have ""Potions for all purposes"". It did not. The product description said the book would contain several things I was looking for but could not find in the book. For a young wizard, this book is great. For an adult, I would not recommend it even if you are new to wizardry."
5,Excellent for beginners,"This is an EXCELLENT resource book for beginners. All the needed correspondences, symbols, etc. are contained within, written in a very simple and entertaining fashion. If anyone is interested in learning about the Pagan path, Wicca, Spirituality, Metaphysics etc., this is a great resource and starter book."
4,Companion for the Apprentice Wizard,"If youngsters were doing these wonderful entertaining learning experiences, we would have a much better future for this world.It is time we got to more basics and touching the beauty of this world we live in."
5,A great start for anyone interested in Wizardry,"This book is filled with lots of exercises for the aspiring Wizard. Meant to be used in conjunction with ""The Grimoire for the Apprentice Wizard"", it does not go in depth on the areas of Wizardry, as the Grimoire does. It is a good addition to your library, but I'd get the Grimoire first."
1,Pretty bad,Dunno who you paid for all these great reviews but if you want a book that actively wastes your time with out teaching you any real knowledge then your in the right place. However if your looking for anything else then go buy a different book.
5,"In love at 35,000 feet","Like another reviewer I heard a track from this album on an airplace audio system-- United's Eurobeat. I bought the CD in the duty free store before leaving Paris. The instrumentals are gorgeous, as is her voice. I plan on buying more of her CDs."
5,Every title on the CD is great,"&#65279;This CD has good sound and is well orchestrated. In the past several years, I have found thatthere are many CD's that had only two or three tracks that I like. That seems to be a complaintby many people, and it is a reason why the music download services are so popular amongconsumers. I like CD's where the whole CD is music I like. That being said, I was extremelypleased with ""L'instant d'après."" Francophone music is expensive in the United States, and I feltthat my money was well spent with this CD.I was pleased with the technical qualities of Natasha St-Pier's voice, as well as all thearrangements and instrumentation on the whole album. ""L'instant d'après"" was a welcomeaddition to my Francophone rock collection. I look toward adding additional titles from NatashaSt-Pier."
5,The Purest Voice,"I first heard this album aboard an Air France jumbo jet somewhere over the Atlantic. For the first time in my life, I was sad to get off an airplane.The real beauty of Natasha St-Pier's voice is that you need not understand a word of French to fall in love with it. In fact, if you're not a fan of mushy pop ballads, you might be better off. But don't let her status as a ""pop"" singer throw you off. Her voice is an instrument in its own right, and when she unleashes it fully, you can get lost in it. In the depth and range of her voice, she easily holds her own with Celine Dion, and given time, will almost surely outdo her.Natasha may be Canadian, but when I hear her voice, I see France, especially Paris. That alone is reason enough for me to love this album.g."
4,Uneven,"Some of the selections, such as Brasilia, are excellent. Others however sound like elvator Muzak."
3,Fancy Pocky,I'm more of a Pocky purist and tend to lean more toward the original flavor. I will however stretch out and buy an occasionalGlico - Men's Chocolate Pocky 3.52 Oz.if I'm in more of a dark chocolate mood. I've tried the Almond Pocky once and was only mildly impressed. To me the almonds take away from the Pocky experience and add too much texture.
3,"Good features, but a couple of shortcomings","The Pros:--A comprehensive group of pre-defined backup sets. The software is determined to help you keep good backups. Kudos!!--Ability to define your own backup sets, very simple UI for this. And the advanced features in defining backups are very good.--Good scheduling for the backup sets. Can have separate schedules for the various sets.--Response to email support inquiries has been fast and courteous.The Cons:--As reported by other reviewers, the software often asks you to re-enter the serial number. This is anoying at best, and fatal if it occurs during an automated backup in the middle of the night.--Cryptic log file. You'll get a report that an error has occured during a backup, but the log file doesn't give much help in determining which files were involved.The Summary:Buy this software for the good UI and ease of use. But quality and reporting needs to improve before I can give it another star."
1,Why???,"Mac's have time machine why would they want this lame, upsupported, sloppy copy of a built in leopard feature. Time Machine works, Prosoft products don't there is the difference."
2,Not entirely reliable,"The user interface on this application is pretty straight forward. Backups are easy to set up and schedule. However, when I actually needed to restore data (hard drive failure), I was not able to restore many of my files. What good is backup software if you can not reliably restore them when needed. Support from Prosoft was lacking - some times taking days to get a response."
5,Great Customer Service,I had some trouble getting the software to work with the older OSX 10.4.11 operating system. I called in and received the information I needed to get the program running from a very patient and competent customer service representative. Now that the program is running it seems to be working flawlessly and fulfilling all of my backup needs.
4,Luke was There,"This book is about a teenage boy whose mother is very sick and has to go to the hospital. His dad left him when he was young so he has no one to raise him, Julius, and his little brother, Danny. Julius and little brother Danny have to live in a foster home with a few other kids. Julius starts to think in the book about how he has a bad life. In school he stops trying and becomes a rude person.This is an great book to read if you are 12 or 13. It really makes you think about what you are thatnkful for. In my opion Eleanor Clymer writes in a style that makes you really interested in it and you won't want to put it down. It makes you feel like you are Julius and in the story you feel the same feelings Julius does."
4,Excellent book for jumping into Windows CE,"Nick Grattan has done an excellent job of covering the Windows CE 2 programming problems and has created a number of excellent examples. This book ranks in my mind with the classic K&R White Book on C.The reader should keep in mind that you must have the CE Toolkit for C++ ($200 US) as well as a Windows CE PIM running version 2.0 to be able to use this book.Unfortunately the first example doesn't work, but all of the other examples that I have tested have functioned exactly as described. The book suffers from a lack of tight editing on the part of IDG (but this is always the case). The author did a fine job, but one does expect publishing companies to do something such as editing. IDG has finally published a book I found to be useful.The CD shipped with the book did not work correctly with VC++, but the author quickly responded with a fix (24 hours!).Author has quickly responded to emails (that related to the book)."
2,Frustratingly small amount of information here,"Being unexperienced with windows programming outside of visual basic and wanting to program for the CE platform, I thought this book might be a good place to start. Never again will I buy another dummies book on programming (maybe gardening.) I was disappointed by the lack of basic information here. The author manages to supply you with just enough to make the examples work, but not enough to do much else."
3,Great for those familiar with using the API,"Anyone comfortable using API functions will have no trouble at all with this book. All examples in each chapter is demonstrated using API, and at the end of each chapter is a paragraph that discusses MFC options. Definitely not for the beginner programmer."
3,Desciption needs to be clarified,These replacement drill bits and countersinks fit into the dewalt DEWALT DW2701 Drill Flip Drive. The main difference in the different screw sizes is the size of the pilot drill bit. Note that the screw driver bit attachement that comes with the Flip drive you have may not fit the larger or smaller screw sizes if you chance the replacemnt drill bit to a different size screw.
4,Fisherprice Aquarium Bouncer,"Our 3 month old son loves this bouncer. He kicks and laughs like crazy watching the star fish go round, the two fish kiss, and the bubbles flow. He also loves the vibrations feature and will sit in the chair with or without the aquarium feature.Con: Over time the water evaporates and this bouncer is more expensive than other fisherprice bouncers.We also have 3 other fisher price bouncers. The rainforest bouncer, how now brown cow bouncer, and comfty bouncer. Our son loves bouncers and we have a couple for our home and one for each grandparents home."
3,Loud and obnoxious,"The safety and the bouncer itself is a good product. The water feature makes the most obnoxious sound ever! Both of my children love to watch it, but the sound it makes is loud and drives me nuts! I ended up buying a different bouncer because my husband and I could not stand it anymore. Just an FYI for future buyers."
2,Dangerous,"I tried this for both of my babies and they would both fall sideways when strapped in (they were horizontal and falling off the side!). The area that straps the baby in is too low and small and only holds the baby at the hip joint. Cool music and my kids liked the star moving, but it is still dangerous."
4,Very nice product,"I was pleased with the quality of this product. The product performs as advertised. Well made. Leather feels and looks smooth. Clip is sturdy. Have not had any problems with it. I did not give it five stars only because I wish I could move the antenna on my Mio 168 without having to take the unit out of the case. I also wish there was a way to close (lock) the case with a wi-fi card in the unit. The card sticks out of the unit a few milimiters, so if you lock the case it will put pressure on the card and may make it pop out."
4,Works like it should,"The mitten clips works well and is pretty sturdy. I gave it a four because I thought I was getting black clips instead I received brown ones. It wasn't that big of a deal, so I didn't return them, but I would have like the black ones. Overall, I would recommend it to a friend."
3,Projekt Tokyo,"Just in case you wondered what this sounds like, I happened to pick this up because I kind of like the occasional ethereal playlist, and if that's your groove this won't disappoint - maybe. It's a bit on the ""tinkly"" side with the bells, and an acoustic guitar replaces the synths, but the most difficult part to get over is that the girl's vocals aren't in English. Well, sure, for the most part Projeckt-type bands don't exactly present crystal clear vocals, but at least the mumbles sound like words you might understand, but not here. Odd it has that much of an effect, but I didn't end up ripping this for my ambient collection, it's on the shelf."
1,dissappointed,"I love these candies so much, it reminds me of when I was little getting them from the corner store. The one problem that I have is that the company says it is in stock, then when I order them, Amazon sends me a message saying they are no longer in stock! urgh!"
4,Pilates in 15 minutes,"My wife bought this book in order to learn Pilates techniques and to add a low impact element to her workout. She found this book very useful, especially the many photographs that illustrate exactly how to position oneself. Easy to read and well diagrammed with many pictures this is a great place to start for anyone new to Pilates exercises."
4,A great jacket.,"This parka was everything we thought it would be. Quality features like velcro sleeve tabs made it well worth the price.The vendor also got it to us in record time.A note: these things run small. Buy a size larger than what you might think your child needs. We did, and we're pleased."
5,Exciting chase through Morocco,"Mrs. Pollifax is looking for an adventure and finds one in Morocco. One of the undercover agents helping the CIA is not who he's supposed to be, and we try to guess along with Mrs. Pollifax before it's too late. Great atmosphere and appealing characters."
5,It's polish that actually lasts!!,"I saw an actress on tv claiming she only uses Zoya nail polish. Now I know why, it stays on forever and doesn't chip in a few days like so many others. It's definately worth trying, you won't regret it. And they have a great variety of colors."
3,not what I thought,"I purchased this product becuase it was listed as one of the best top coats and I wanted something to prevent chipping. It hasn't proved any better than the Sally Hansen's that I already have, and it doesn't even leave a smooth shiny finish."
1,vials arrived broken,"I purchased this item with the Renew. It arrived within 3 days but the vials were shattered. I contacted the seller, Nailetc, and they said they would only replace it if it was in the unopened package. I have not had the chance to open the box it was in the minute I removed it from the bubble envelope it spilled all over my kitchen counter. I will reorder from a different seller and let you know thw results."
4,A very good quick reference.,"Lacking any pretence at being scientific literature this CD is no less useful. It is a compilation of linked HTML pages so a web browser is useful to view it. This makes cross references and name lookup relatively fast. The photos are perhaps its strongest asset. If you see a name somewhere you can usually look it up, see if the name is current or a pseudonym and see a very high quality photo. This is particularly helpful if you have only passing familiarity with a genus or species.The only drawback to this CD is the lack of a taxonomic key for identifying items. Since it would seem that a computer is uniquely suited to assist in the taxonomic identification of these unique plants this is unfortunate. I would strongly encourage the author to consider this addition in subsequent releases. This would make the CD truly invaluable"
5,A review of an encyclopedia of cacti & succulents,it is immense it is full of information and i love it it really helps to identify and learn about cacti and succulents.
5,This is a great album,"I purchased this album without really knowing what I was buying. I got it because it came up in the ""people who purchased this item also purchased..."" page when I bought the Loose Fur album, which also features O'Rourke.I absolutely love it. I've now listened to Sonic Youth and Loose Fur and have decided that O'Rourke is at his best when he's solo. I bought this CD not really knowing much about Jim O'Rourke, but now I'm a big fan."
5,Love Lisa and O'Rourke's Significance,"The movie was a sad good movie and the music was : who sing's and play's these 60's 00's songs ? . No definite soundtrak but these recording ( In Significance ) and I think : these guy is fresh and of course , kinda weird - wakky ... Just my type of music ... Remember Rushmore's Chad and Jeremy's Summer song ?... Good fun Music ..."
4,Happiness is the Key to a Healthy Life,"This book allowed me to realize what I was feeling and going through in my own life. I was able to relate to many things Dianne talks about. Having read the book, I feel as if a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders and I'm ready to take the next step in life."
3,HEBREW PRIMER WOOKBOOK,I was satisfied with the book It has more wear than I expected but it was acceptable pages were clean & unmarked I would consider buying from this retailer again
5,A Must-Have,"""The First Hebrew Primer"" textbook is easy to understand and easily facilitates learning biblical Hebrew, but, unless you are a savant, you MUST have the ""Answer Book for The First Hebrew Primer"" to know if you have a clear understanding of what is being taught. The Answer Book has been an invaluable tool in providing the correct translations, spellings, and grammatical solutions to the hundreds of chapter exercise challenges."
5,Wonderful first dress-up doll for your little girl!,"We just received this doll yesterday and my 32 month old daughter seems to really love it. She loves dressing and redressing her new ""dolly"" and she doesn't need me to help her. She's just a little too young yet for Barbie dolls or Polly Pockets. In addition to the doll itself, I also puchased one extra set of clothing - the Bedtime outfit. I think I will be purchasing the other sets of clothing as well if this toy remains such a big hit!"
4,Thoughtful Early Classical Music,"I have been purchasing and listening to as many of the wonderful Chandos Contemporaries of Mozart series as I can afford and find the time to listen to, and this disc lives up to expectations. I agree with an earlier reviewer that Baguer may be more favorably compared to Haydn than to Mozart, which to my mind is definitely a good thing. The music is clever, witty, and inventive, not just pretty or emotional as Mozart often can be. The performances and recording quality are of course up to the usual Chandos standards.If you're exploring less well known composers of early classical music, this disc, and probably the entire Chandos series are must haves."
3,"Nice quality,","This is a nice set, but kinda pricy for what you get. This is basicly a toddlar manipulitave, it will help build strength and coordinatin. My children (age 18 months and 4 years- my older children didn't care about it, not even my special needs child who alway wants a 'fidget' thanks to our great public school system in all their wisdom) played with this for about 5 minutes... maybe they will come back to it. This is nicely made, solid wood toy."
3,Fun for Grandma; kids ignore it.,"I thought this would be a good educational toy for my 2-1/2 year old grandson, but he figured it out right away and went on to find something else to play with.Maybe I'll try it out on my granddaughters; they are content to play with things a lot longer."
5,Excellent for Fine Motor Skills,"We purchased this for our 6 year old child that needs work on his fine motor skills. He loves playing with this and making different things with them, while he is having fun he is also giving his hands a great work out. I would recommend this toy for anyone that is looking for a toy that will help with fine motor skills."
3,Didn't hold my daughter's interest,"I bought this for my daughter to work on her fine motor coordination. She's now 2.5 and has never been particularly interested in it. They're cute, but she has more fun trying to take off shampoo bottle lids or the toothpaste cap than she does playing with this toy. The most I've seen her do with it is take the coloured parts off the screw and pretend that the screw is an ice cream cone. I wouldn't buy this again."
4,Great toy! but my son's not interested,"I think this is a wonderful learning toy and bought it for my son at around 20 months of age. It was a little advanced for him at that age, and even at 36 months, he rarely plays with it, despite being very ""mechanically-minded"". We have a lot of Plan toys & this one probably has gotten the least amount of play time. I still love it though! But my toddler recommends the cactus game over this toy."
5,Great toy for little hands and motor skills,"Bought this for my 19 month old. I keep them in the car for her to tinker with. They are quite large, so no worries about choking hazards at all. With a baby sister on the way, that was a huge plus. The quality is really impressive and the colors are wonderful. Plus, safe water-based stains make this a reassuring buy. Plan Toys is a great company and we have severals toys from them. I am always impressed by the quality and how they rate superior in safety tests!"
4,22 month old boy,"It is a tad difficult for my 22 month old son. He want's to take it on and master this toy but his little hand's have a difficult time with doing full rotations in order to twist off the nuts from bolt but sticking with it. I am confident he will be engaged in this toy for some time to come. It is durable, fun colors, great for kido's that like to twist and are advances in the dexterity of hands/fingers for kido's my sons age."
3,"Take the good, ignore the bad","If you can overlook the illustrations of black-eyed mushroom-headed gnomes (what's that about, anyway?) and ""in-your-face"" style, this book has a few good gems. I wish the author didn't seem to clobber everything around him, and my gut says it shouldn't take well over 300 pages to convey the information, but in the end I think this book will probably have some effect on my nature-education volunteer work."
1,Very little for your money,"I have a Nikon D50 with at 70-300mm lens. I searched the internet for something to cover my camera for our outdoor Alaska shots. I couldn't find anything to fit with my longer lens. The Tenba RC-18 is very thin for $40. It is probably about $5 worth of material. It has a few velcro closures but of course NO instructions on how to best adapt it to your camera. I've already had to break out my sewing machine to stitch more velcro on the nylon fabric to seal it up more. I would not recommened the Tenba product because of its' oversized, thin, poorly constructed material. The picture shown of this item is probably custom fit from a professional. Definitely not something that you can use right out of the box! Keep looking for a better waterproof cover."
3,Not a bad start...,"When I found Dondero's little volume, I was delighted. Then I scanned the entries for languages I knew a little about. While this isn't a bad survey for someone who travels a lot, there are too many errors in spelling and pronunciation suggestions for the serious language learner to use it as a reference. Going round the world and need to be able to ask for the essentials? Buy this. But if you're looking for authoritative references, better collect a few Lonely Planet regional guides."
5,Fantastic book and advice,"This book is fantastic! Eric helps people who have taken other classes and still don't know how to speak another language. You will learn his secrets.I met Eric and find him to be a genuine and down-to-earth person. His book is easy to read and straight to the point.He is an incredible man, and it shows the mind can learn many languages, along with everything else that we do every day.I am looking forward to following his advice and learning Spanish, again. I would like to review my French that I took in High School. Another language I am interested in, is Arabic, since I am getting married to an Egyptian soon. So I have a lifetime to do all of this."
1,Needs work,"I purchased this book before traveling in Europe and found the most amusing thing was to get the locals to correct the mistakes in it! Out of the German, Italian, Spanish and French sections only the Spanish seemed correct!There are spelling mistakes and grammatical errors, sometimes the wrong word (similar to the correct word) is used and the Italian section has Spanish mixed into it. Although I did not need them there seem very few words for some of the Asian languages. Dondero needs to get this proofed by native speakers. You will be mostly understood but do as I say and get a friendly local to correct their section. Your book will come away from your trip as changed as you are!Good on Dondero for trying, it's a fabulous concept that seems to have simply been rushed to the publisher too soon.Maria"
2,Bare without the essentials,"I found this book to be more of a guideline to have a chatty conversation with a stranger rather than a necessity for travel. The majority of the phrases are ""Where are you from"" ""Do you like to..."" or similar rather than ""Where is the nearest public toilet"" or ""How do I take a train from A to B""...the latter are the things you NEED to communicate while travelling!"
1,A Waste of Money,"This book is pretty useless if you need anything more than simple phrases. The author's claim of speaking dozens of languages rings pretty hollow- does speaking 100 simple words constitute ""speaking"" the language?"
1,"Interesting, but quite useless","Why would you waste your money to learn how to say a hundred things in 40 languages? Chances are you will never use them, and chances are you will quickly forget what you learn. As a speaker of many foreign languages, here is my advise: beware of any cheap methods to learn foreign languages fast. Do not waste your time learning 100 things in one language. Unless you are going to devote your time seriously to learn to the brim of fluency you will be wasting your time. Learning a foreign language takes time and dedication. If you are going to learn a language, pick one, buy the books and tapes and start memorizing. Do not waste your money in a book that teaches you how to ask where is the bathroom in 40 languages. That will not do you any good."
1,Majority of reviews are 5 star?,"I seriously believe that most of the 5 star reviews here were written by people who have not actually tried to use this book.It's an interesting concept, but the book is chock full of errors and mostly useless, though I will say that the author thinks exceedingly highly of himself without having a lot to back it up. At least not in this book. It's almost as thought some of the translations are direct from babelfish because they're sort of close, but laughably off in many cases.If you seriously attempt to use this book, prepare to be the life of the party, because you will be a hoot--of course, the laughs will be on you."
4,Listen!,I disagree with the Amazon review (Jed Distler) regarding Schubert's Impromtu's on this recording. These pieces are more expressive than Perahia's which I found rather dull in comparison. Horowitz was a master of romanticism and brings these gems to life. I strongly urge anyone to sit down and listen carefully (without interruption) to these beautifully played pieces composed by a genius - Schubert.
1,Not Available,"The product I ordered (twice) is not availalbe from Amazaon's two distributors and is not made by the manufacturer. I ordered the ""Premium"" and received both times the ""Admiration"" version of this Wearever pan. I called Wearever and was told that the the 8 inch ""Premiun"" version is no longer mamufactured. This is really too bad because I order a 8 inch, 10 inch, and 12 inch ""Premium"" version. Received the 10 and 12 inch, which my wife realy likes, and than not to get the 8 inch is realy sad. I would have ordered as a set from Amazon but not offered. This is an Amazon, Distributor, and Manufacturer problem at the expense of a frustrated customer."
3,Beware!! It is not Premium!!!,"I have just received this Saute pan.I thought that I have ordered the WearEver Premium Hard-Anodized 8-Inch Saute pan.What I have received is the WearEver Admiration Hard-Anodized 8-Inch Saute pan instead.Beware!!!! Before you place your order, make sure it is what you want. Is it a Premium or is it an Admiration?????"
1,Waste of Money,This is a book on building a log cabin. It has 80 pages and is of size 5.5 inches by 8.5 inches. Now what kind of building instruction can fit in such a small space. Go to a bookstore and have a look at this book before spending your money.
4,A Positive Review,"The negative reviews is what convinced me to buy this book. It was exactly what those reviews claimed, which is what I wanted to get from the book. A step by step book on building a better homes and gardens cabin it is not. But as a guide to building a private get away, its great. Id be interested in other books by this author. I read this in one sitting."
4,She's cute honest and insightful - this is an eye opener,"C'mon- she's not a PHD candidate at some university- this is not critical literature- it's just her rock and roll story. I found it very telling that she lived for so many years as a codependant housewife in a dysfunctional high profile relationship. A very intriging follow up to her first book. I like her and I liked the book, (as well as I'm with the Band.)The two books are an eye opener to just how macho and swaggering the rockers of old really are. Why begrudge Pamela?"
5,No Holds Barred - Once Again !,"I picked up Miss P's first book, I'm With The Band, only about a year ago, and I admit I keep coming back for more ! This is a witty, page-turning sequel that does what most sequels can't do: keep the juicy stories flowing !! The journey from page 1 until the end has its ebbs of laughter and flows of tears. Pamela's writing style is recognizably her own, and she sure knows how to tell a story ! An amazing read, and am impatiently awaiting another piece of work from the tantalizing Pamela des Barres."
5,cool cool cool,I love her writing and all of her books!!! This one is a continuation of her life story. A great read if you are a biography junkie like me. I love the honesty!!Kudos Pamela!! :o}
4,"Perfect follow up to ""I'm With the Band""!!!!","For an avid, free thinking music fan like myself, ""I'm With the Band"" was akin to The Bible. Pamela DesBarres follow-up book, "",Take Another Little Piece of My Heart-A groupie Grows Up"", is just as vital, filled with no-holds barred (ha, ha) honesty and wit. Some of the luster of Pamela's rock n' roll life has worn off, but her earthy determination and love of life keep her going. And as the reader you are right there with her. Another gem from a delightful writer."
3,It's All About Pamela,"One of those times where the writer perhaps does not realize that the early book (I'm With The Band) was a screaming success not so much because we were infatuated with the writer, but because we enjoyed the stories & the details about others. So here is the sequel which is more about Pamela herself and her life, and well it's not really that interesting. Granted yes there's the same charming breathless exuberance. It's very readable. But the subject has no resonance outside of a small circle etc. Another slant is the book lacks detail, e.g. hey the sex was great with Jimmy Page, but after all a few thousand girls could probably say that. Give us a little more since we went beyond twitter and bot an actual book, dear Pamela."
3,Hardly a classic!,"Jean Rollin made some classic films, but this is not one of them. A vapid and narcissistic guy leads the female lead through a series of bad experiences, to (I suppose) understand how dismal life would be...if he were not at the center of it....as his wife/ lover/ accomplice. I am SO TIRED of French and Italian films telling me what great lovers they are. I have been to France, but not Italy...but I find this whole concept very hard to embrace. The narcissistic attitude on display is not only false, but very dismaying to any female with an I.Q. above..say 50! What is it with Mediterranean men? American men (who have equally bizarre ideas about sex and gender) can learn NOTHING from watching this film..except how to avoid another heart-wrending episode in their life. Buy a vibrator....it's ( by far) more dependable!"
3,"review of ""Clicker Training""","I had heard of clicker training that had developed from working with dolphins and had been extended to dogs, and lately, horses.The descriptions seemed very sinple but requiring great sensitivity and sense of timing. This book is understanding of the difficulties a newcomer would have, and proceeds in a very orderly and detailed manner, step by step, to planned results."
2,Kinda dumb....,"I got my travel lite brite free when I purchased the lite brite cube. I'm glad I didn't pay for it.I suspect that no one at Hasbro actually used this. It's not very travel friendly at all.First, they put the compartment to hold the pegs on the bottom with a lid that flips down. Open it up and everything pours out.I ""fixed"" this by removing the Lite Brite sticker, putting a generic pony sticker over the spot and telling my daughter that the compartment goes on top. (I changed the sticker so my daughter wouldn't hold it the wrong way.) The compartment works pretty good when it's on top.Then, the light turns off automatically which is nice for saving batteries, but the timing is way too short! You have to constantly keep pushing the button which gets frustrating when you're trying to use it in a dark car.These are two simple things that could have been remedied with a little fore-thought and play-testing."
1,Can't hear it!,"Just got mine and threw it into the player. But I have to turn it up all the way even to hear it. Obviously something went wrong in production or somewhere. Sounds like it might be a good version otherwise. Oh well, I'll just call it a loss and get another version. Don't know if this is a common problem with Chandos or just with this CD."
3,How disappointing....,"This fine work, recorded by an OK orchestra, is marred beyond any sensible enjoyment by some terrible engineering. As you turn up the volume, as is necessary in order to hear the quieter parts well (Mistake No. 1), a high-pitched whine grows louder and louder, until it competes with and covers up the sound of the orchestra (Mistake No. 2). That terrible annoyance aside, the performance just isn't that great. A weak percussion section leaves the driving parts of the work rather bland, and sloppy string entrances and exits just bore the listener after a while, rather than continually sharpening your focus, like Shostakovich does at his best. This CD is simply a bad recording; don't buy it. Try Haitink or Stokowski, but stay away from this."
1,[Additional] tape cost not included!,"Though the book is good, there is no mention of the [additional] cost for the tapes! There are other books that are good enough and come with tapes. The tapes are good to have, but not at that price. There are plenty of other books available that come with tapes..."
4,A Great Purchased... Right On Time.,It was a good Purchaseda... I got what I was offered and on time. Rate 10
2,vignetes big time,The lense does not cover the full chip.... actually it vignettes so that about 40% is black... so I use it once in a while only but is cheap enough that it did not bother me.... still it'd be nice to have a12 that would match the other 2 c mount lense i got here for my micro 4/3...
5,Sync Cord,"Sync Cord was delivered promptly and it works! I was really hesitant to buy with only two reviews, but everyone has to start somewhere right? It was good fast service."
4,Warmbats,"I love these boots. They're warm and comfortable, and at the price cannot be beat. I'm rating them a ""4"", because they're my first sheepskin boots, and there might be some better out there."
4,Movin' n' Shakin',"I really like how Stephan seamlessly flows through traditional reggae, hip hop, and even rap. If this doesn't make you groove. I don't know what will. Every time I listen to this album I can't help but move. I can't wait to see him live for the first time at electric forest festival in michigan in July. I'm so excited. I can't wait to groove and move! Phenomenal album. I would highly recommend it, especially if you're looking to dance!"
4,Excellent music...but,"Excellent CD. Balanced. A bit of everything. The first reggae song actually occurs on track 7. Another good piece of work by Stephen, irrespective of the fact that Mind Control won him a Grammy.The only problem I have with the CD is that a track 12 is listed which never plays. It appears as though it' s a video clip but so far it does not even show in any DVD player. Not sure what' s happening there."
5,Fire,"this cd is well balanced. the tracks fit stephen and his voice is relaxing. there is a track for every market on this album,its well appreciated."
3,"The voice of his father, but not the sound","I was amazed at how much Stephen sounds like his father Bob when he sings, they are so close. But one has to be sure to emphasize that although he sounds like his dad, his music does not necessarily sound like his dad's. All in all, a nice mix of rap, reggae and dancehall. Kind of brief, but a nice step and a fine addition to the Marley legacy."
3,"few reggaes, lots of hip hops and raps!","it's ok for me, but i was xpecting more reggae tunes. the hip hop and rap songs were fine, and we can hear Marley's blood on his voice, like hear ziggy, or remember when he was on the melody makers... may be hear latin reggae be much better than hear influences of the ""anglo"" market. we can make some fusions but don't forget roots and the island grooves."
4,Stephen Marley,Came as described... Very pleased... Love Reggae music!! Love Amazon!! Keep it Real!!! The columbia Gorge Rocks the Hardest and GO HUSKIES (WA)!!!! Jah Rasta Fari!!! Hempfest in Seattle Aug 17th!!!
5,good cd,"I really enjoy mind control by Stephen Marley, he has soothing beats. He also demostrates good lyrical ability to represent his cause, all around good cd. my favorite tracks 1,3,5,7,9,11 Real good feel good music"
3,This book could have been more,"This book is really the story of a few teams looking for ""breakthrough"" early hominid fossils. As such it is episodic, and fails to give a broad picture of what has been learned about human evolution how it was learned. While generally well written and up to date, the concept of the book prevents it from being either a good overview of ""The First Humans"" or a compelling story. Past books written by paleoanthropologists themselves (Leakey, Johanson, Falk, and Shipman come to mind) have both explained more science and displayed far more passion for the quest, but at the cost of being expressions of one person's viewpoint rather than an attempt to deal with the subject objectively. It's been several years since I've found a really compelling book on this subject, so this one may be as good a choice as any for an up to date popular book. But it would be nice to see some more ""insider"" books hit the shelves with some real passion!"
4,An excellent primer,"This is an excellent primer for the general reader on where we are in searching for the oldest fossils of man, and it's amazing how much has been added to the field in the last ten years. The fossil record of hominids now dates back over six million years. Gibbons does an excellent job of setting out what has been found, what it might mean, and the personalities involved in it all. A good, solid, interesting read."
1,What About The Hominids?,"This book centers entirely too much on the anthropologists themselves. Its mostly about their perils, hardships, personalities, and petty squabbles. What about the hominids. It jumps all over the place and never gives any real overview. Also, its too expensive. It was a HUGE disappointment. I read over half of it before I came to the conclusion that it was never really going to discuss the subject matter indicated by the title. A much better book on the subject is ""Masters of the Planet"" by Ian Tattersol. It is actually about the origins of man, instead of glorifying a bunch of modern day Prima Donna scientists."
3,First Human,"This book is OK., but is not up to date. The Humans found in Atapuerca, Spain and especially those from Dmanisi in Georgia are missing."
4,"Great Gaming Keyboard, not so great for everyone else.","This is a phenominal gaming keyboard. The keys have that mushy quality feeling that gives the right edge to gaming. This helps you allow the ones living with you to sleep peacefully while you stay up gaming all night. But if you're like me and don't play games your whole life, then you may want a different keyboard. For people that type a lot (programmers, linux users, people that have jobs) this may be a worse choice. The keys are so soft that they require you to push harder (or maybe they just make you think you need to push harder). This creates unecessary strain on your fingers and wrist. Gamers, this is the keyboard to get. But if you want more than a gaming keyboard, you MAY want to try a different one. Right now I am using a Dell keyboard that i am perfectly happy with. However, if you are looking for an upgrade, I'd suggest a Logitech keyboard."
3,Sticky Keys When It Ages,"It's a good keyboard, but the keys which are wider than standard such as SHIFT, ENTER and BACKSPACE all tend to get sticky as the keyboard gets a little older. I have had three Logitech keyboards (all wireless and all expensive) and all three exhibit the same problem. Logitech's no help, so just plan on learning to fight the SHIFT key when your keyboard gets to be a year old or more."
1,Keyboard sticks after one month!,I purchased this wireless keybaord from Best Buy. Within one month the keys were sticking and now it's completely unusable. It's the second Logitech keyboard I've bought and the last.
5,This is THE Keyboard,"I don't see how you couldn't love this keyboard. I bought it because 1. it's Logitech. and 2. because it matches my case, monitor & mouse. The extra buttons are nice. And there are sure a lot of them. Honestly, I use the volume control more then anything. But, I'm so use to plain KB's it's gonna take me awhile to get use to having 1 touch keys. I set some of other ones to lauch custom apps. So now I can pop into Photoshop or Flash super quick. It's probably really no faster then clicking on the icon on my Desktop. But single button access is always nice. The default layout is pretty good actually. But, every button is customizable. You you could really go all out. Only problem is, they are all already labeled, so if you do change them. You'll have to have a good memory. I think Logitech got it almost perfect with this KB. I'm curious to see what they bring out next though."
4,Smooth but big,the cons:1. the keyboard is big and bulkythe pros:1. long shift key2. internet keys3. scroll keys4. volume & mute keys5. keyboard is quiet6. usb & ps2 attachments7. for its size it is light
4,"Great keyboard, but.........","I really like all of the extra features on this keyboard, like media player control, and volume control, and many many others. One thing that is a draw back, is that it has a sleep button, but appearantly it doesnt work with XP. Seems kinda strange that its compatable with 98/ME, and not XP! Seeing how this is probably the most abundant OS out there, and will be for the foreseeable future. Other than that, its great!"
1,BEWARE OF ADWARE / SPYWARE,"Keyboard works as advertised. However, it is absolutley loaded with ad-ware / spyware. This will be my last purchase of a Logitech product. I will now deal with their competitors, whom apparently have more integrity and class."
2,Disappointing Key Feel,"I really wanted to like this keyboard, but couldn't get over the lousy feel of the keys. Compared to the soft, precise feel of the Dell keyboards I had been using for years, this keyboard is harsher and really slows down typing. On the plus side, the hot keys generally work well, except for the volume knob (which is not precise enough) and the internet wheel and buttons on the left, which are harsh. This was also a dust magnet for some reason. Anyway, I wound up buying a Dell Keyboard instead."
2,Keys start to 'stick' after about a year of use.,"I like everything else about this keyboard, however after about 1 year of normal household use, the keys have become 'sticky'. I don't mean that they stick down, but instead developed just enough resistance to be annoying. They work OK if you press exactly straight down, but not if there's any side-load on them. I know it sounds picky, but I have not had this issue with any other keyboard I've ever used."
2,A good story surrounded by evangelism,"On one level, ""The Sugar Creek Gang"" (original title) is a typical, slightly over-the-top boys' yarn of adventure. But unless the current paperbacks have been heavily edited, the books are crammed with mini-sermons and asides that cram evangelical Christianity down the reader's throat, as well as some comments that would be considered racist today. It is entirely possible to write a book that will appeal to children and present Christian values more subtly (""The Chronicles of Narnia"", for example). But Hutchens is apparently not one for subtlety."
4,This is the second book of the Loremasters Of Elundium,"This book continues the saga of Thane and the King and Thanes rise to power. Not as good as the first or the third book, however, it sets the scene for an excellent third book."
4,pop rocks awash in a sunshine daydream,"Call and Response's asian import far surpasses their domestic realease of the debute cd.why? you may ask yourself. well, it has one extra track, silly.Hey Mr. Weatherman is awsomeriffic, supernicious and oooglysmoogle. I love it! It is so worth the extra twenty bucks for the one additional track. get it and be happy. or dont get it and be sad, your choice."
5,Thorens Rocks,Over the years I have had many different brands of turntables. The Thornes 170 S is a true table for the best in all vinyls. I am so pleased I ordered this one.
2,See You Later Gladiator,I gave my book a 2 out of 5 because the ending was too easy and the book was confusing. Then when they had time to go find the book they were looking for they were doing a burping contest.The book is about these three kids and they're around a gladiator that wants to kill them and try to talk him out of it but it doesn't work. I would recommend this book to people who like fighting.
5,Gladiators beware!,"This story is about three boys named Joe, Sam, and Fred. These three boys have a very strange book that, when they say special words, it will transport them to a different time. In order to get back home, they have to find the book which is hidden in Rome, and that is where they are too! When they arrive, they are in a Gladiator stadium! To find out more, read See You Later Gladiator."
2,See You Later Gladiator,Michael P. wrote:I gave the book 2 stars because I did not like it because it was weird. There was a burping scene and that is why is was weird. It is about 3 boys who are looking for a book to get back home. But first they had to get out of the net that the gladiator threw at them. I would recommend this book to people who like fighting and burping.
