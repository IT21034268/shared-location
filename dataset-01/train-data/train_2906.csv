4,"Great sount, Awesome Monuverability","This is a great product for begginning DJs or for home users, the construction is great because I am a college student that totes around campus and when I'm doing homework in the Library and it handles all my bike riding and bouncing around campus. After a few hours of listening, it does become uncomfortable to wear but the sound is unbelievable and you just forgo the pain and keep going. I would recommend this to anyone looking to get into the DJing profession as a beginner or any home user that likes alot of sound/bass and like to enjoy any movie."
4,Lovely Sounds,My boyfriend had these headphones before but broke them. I bought him the same pair and now he is more careful and he enjoys them. he says they are one of the best to use for production.
4,Incredible sound,"I love these head phones. Only issues with them is that durability is not that great, Handle carefully. Hi's and lows coming clear and sweet."
1,poor quality,"I received this unit as a refurbished replacement for the MDRv600 after it fell apart under warranty. I had to pay an extra $29 fee plus shipping to return the defective unit and receive the MDRv700 (600 not available). The MDRV700 left ear piece stopped working entirely within 60 days. I didn't contact Sony in time for the refurbished replacement to be covered under warranty, so after waiting on hold for the most part of an hour, I now know that I have wasted about $130 total investment. With the poor quality of the first two units though, I'm not so sure I would have wanted to invest any more fees or shipping costs to try again. If you buy this, save your receipt and paperwork and be diligent about calling promptly when the product fails."
1,Mine broke as well,"Had these for a few years and sounded nice. It's a bit heavy. Then, the plastic cracked where the swivel is. Made of cheap plastic. Beware!"
1,Fall apart after a year,"I see a lot of glowing reviews around here, but when I buy headphones this expensive, I expect them to last more than a year. The real problem here is that they have lots of tiny plastic joints. This means that all those joints will crack over time, and even with me supergluing it back together constantly, these headphones just would not last. I now have Grado SR-80s, and they sound better and will last much longer, seeing as they lack plastic joints."
3,"Great sound, lousy construction","They sound great, with a lot of emphasis in the lower end, nice mid, but the high end is a little weak. The problem with these headphones is after a while (between 6 months and 3 years) almost all of them break - a plastic rotating part breaks. This happens a lot, it's not an isolated fault, and I was very careful with mine.Look at the Sony MDR-V900s, that don't have the rotating cups, so should be more durable. Alternately Sennheiser HD 280 Pro or Koss a/130 are worth a look."
4,"Quality audio, Alright comfort","This is the second pair of these headphones I have bought. Their audio quality is outstanding, and I especially enjoy using them on airplaines as they deliver louder audio and block out background noise. Their downside is that they press against your ears, so after wearing them for two or more hours, your ears get sore. A minor complaint, but a significant one if you use these to watch a movie or listen to a lot of music."
4,"Great Sound, Good Headphones","Just to get this out of the way, these headpones sound great! They are by far the best next to $300-$500 dollar bose headphones.The Good:1) Great sound2) awsome style3) fold up into a rather small bag (comes with the headphones)4) It is from Sony if that tells you anythingThe Bad:1) (for me) they put unusual pressure on the end of my jaw wich is a little uncomfortable (i have a very cut jaw)Clearly the good outway the bad, but if you are planning to wear these for long periods of time you might want to try them out some where first. If you dont mind reajusting the headphones every once in awhile to realive pressure this is a MUST buy."
5,Bangin' item,"I've had my eye on these headphones for a while now, waiting for the price to go down... but you know how these Sony products go... you pay for quality right? Well I recently go a pay raise and decided ""what the hell, why not"". I believe the term is: Buy nice or buy twice. So i Got them and am very pleased. They sound quality is great. IF you're someone who can tell the difference between a 192 and 128 mb mp3, then these are for you. Rich, deep bass and comfortable ear cups make these a joy to use. Wear 'em out in public and you're telling the world that you're either a serious disk jockey or a poser with too much money to spend (I would be the latter, but I don't go out in public with these)."
4,For those who have purchased these,"I purchased these for my husband two years ago. He has absolutely loved them and has completely enjoyed them. Yesterday they broke and before purchasing another pair here, I checked the reviews. It seems like many, many others have had problems with the construction of these headphones. I contacted Sony to see if there had been a recall or other complaints, and besides being rude, they stated that they have had no complaints. So...if you have bought these and they broke, contact Sony. It seems that there may be a manufacturing issue here. Otherwise they are great and I just ordered a new pair. Hope these last longer."
3,"Great headphones, but...","Great headphones. I'm a dj in Seattle and typically play 12 to 24 events a year, and these are great headphones. However, the joint where the ear cup swivels will break on you. I've had 3 pairs of these now and they have all broken in the same place, and everyone I know that have owned them have experienced the same problem. Other than that, these are the perfect headphone for dj use."
4,From a DJ's perspective...,"I am on my second pair of these headphones. I bought my first pair in 2000. All the standard things went wrong with my first pair... the plastic around the swivel joint cracked and the plug began to go bad. However, I used these headphones for over 6 years in the club and at home. I really don't see how anyone can expect them to last any longer than they did. For the price these heaphones are fantastic. They have great response and are extremely convenient and comfortable to use. I have used the Pioneer HDJ-1000 as well and am not really sure where the extra $50 is going.As a DJ I can honestly tell you that this is your best pair of heaphones for the price."
5,Reliable As All Hell,"To keep a long story short, these headphones are super reliable. My girlfriend has some cheaper Audio Technica headphones and they feel like some fisher price toy with horrible sound. If it says SONY, then it's usually good. This holds true here. They have rugged construction and cancel all outside noise when worn. They also sound GREAT. I've seen many dj's rockin these headphones with their gear. You just can't go wrong for the price."
2,"excellent quality, but big, heavy and too hot","bought this phone just for casual usage, to listen music and movies at home.on the plus side, the quality is awesome, excellent bass and good isolation from external noises.on the minuses, this thing is bulky and super heavy. It causes too much pressure on your head and hurts just a few minutes after putting them on. Also the cups make way too much heat, and you can barely stay with them on after an hour or so.It may be a good headphone for DJs (that are constantly putting them on and off), but for continuous usage there may be better options."
1,Plastic swivel joints break!!!,"Like other reviews, the swivel points for the ear cups are plastic and will eventually break. Mine did. Buyer's remorse scale: 9.5 (10 being worst)Don't waste your money!"
1,Fuggetaboutit!,"Now I know after reading my headline, you are probably thinking to yourself, ""Who is this guy and what's he doing calling these headphones crap?"" Well, I, like most of you, was lured to these headphones by their smooth looks and the infamous ""50mm driver"" and the ""high quality sound"" that they had. The sound, while good, was not worth the extra cash. The sound was no better than any other pair of headphones that I have ever used (I had never owned a pair of headphones that cost over $35 until these). In addition to that, these headphones are built in such a shoddy manner that they did not last me two whole months. I took them on an airplane, put them in my carry-on baggage, and they broke.The headphones you want are the $75 ones made by Sennheiser. Amazon.com carries them, so get them instead!"
1,Plastic parts brake and fall apart after short use,"Plastic parts are made out of cheap, thin, bad quality plastic. Universal joint (swivel) broke after short use of headphones. Cannot use headphones. But the sound was good."
1,too much fragile,"I cant understand why Sony make a headphone ""for djs"" with plastic and it brokes so fast. Mine lasts only 5 months."
2,They look nice But they are Cheaply made!,"This product is garbage. Bought a pair and the left earcup t-bone snapped after 1 month of usage. I ended using duck tape to keep them together for a few more weeks before dropping them in the trash. For this product it is obvious that SONY uses the cheapest, lightest plastic they could find...which is why they are so light on your head. Don't waste your money on these. Purchase the Technics RP-DH1200 - DJ headphones. I got the technics Dj headphones and I have found that they are a a lot heavier than the SONYs, but made with a much more durable and thicker plastic that can stand up to regular dj use."
2,Do not buy,"While these are nice and comfy, the connector breaks easily and the ""skin"" peals off easily and with average or quicker than expected time..."
3,"decent, while they lasted","They were great before they were broken.If you're looking for a throwaway set of phones for whatever, these might be good. However, if you're looking for something a bit sturdier, look at Sennheiser HD's or brands like those, these Sony phones have issues staying together."
2,poor sound and uncomfortable for the price,"I bought these a few years back when I needed a second pair fast and was stuck shopping at Circuit City. I'd previously been spoiled with a set of similarly priced Sennheisers. The Sonys are just awful by comparison. They hurt my ears after about 20 minutes, and the sound is tinny and too strong in the midrange."
4,Sony Headphones Review,"this is definitely a good buy. the sound is clear and loud, perfect for any mp3 player. it is also very comfortable.i read on Cnet that after three years, they still love it, i havnt had it that long but if i do, i will be a happy owner of this item.its a bit pricey, but well worth it.as long as you dont sleep with these things on with your head rested against something and the headphones pressing against your ears, you should not encounter much or any pain.also, the wire for the headphone is extremely long. good for DJs, but not for owners who just want to walk around listening to music.all in all though, it is still a great buy and i definitely recommend it to anyone willing to pay for it!"
4,"Good, but only buy for DJ use.","I'm not a DJ at all. I bought these headphones because I was tired of my cheap $20 pair of headphones. I wanted sometihing that would block out everything that my parents had to say. So I went with these. These headphones are awesome and i do like them a lot. The only problem, is that i think i could have gotten the same quality with a cheaper pair of headphones. These say for DJ's for a reason, and thats just how it goes. So, if you don't mind spending the money then go ahead, otherwise if you're a smart shopper and want the most for your money, i suggest looking for a different style of headphones."
1,"Plastic Cracked after 2 weeks, but sounds great!","What a disappointment. They looked so sturdy. They sound pretty good. I bought them off Ebay from some dude in China for $40, shipping included. Perhaps they shipped with a crack on both sides but I don't think so. I could hear something cracking but I couldn't see where the crack was. Well now I know, both speaker arms are cracked right at the swiveling joint.I'm glad I only paid $40 US"
1,"Great sound, but durability is a problem","Listen guys, these headphones look great and sound great, but they have a huge problem with durability. Many parts are made of plastic, and crack after about 3 or 4 months. Why then do you see all the big djs with these headphones you ask? Well I will tell you - A. They can afford to replace them every three or 4 months when they crack, and B. Many of these top djs get their heaphones for free to influence the rest of us to purchase them. If you are going to spend this much money on headphones, I highly recommend the Technics RP DH1200's. They sound great, look great, and dont crack after three months.I DJ for a living and I have used many different headphones and have seen all of them in action with other djs. If you are playing around at home from time to time djing, then these sony headphones are ok. But if you are a professional dj and play out several times a week, I highly suggest you stay away from these Sony headphones at all costs."
1,Cheaply made,"I agree with the previous review. I would like to add a few things though. In my opinion, these headphones are simply not designed to last more than one month in a busy club environment. I took very good care of them, and I had tape around the plastic hinges within a year due to general light wear. The ear pads also cracked / flaked off shortly after the hinges gave way. The sound quality is 4 stars, but I give the durability/quality a -3 star rating."
3,"nice sound, but a pain to wear","I was impressed with the sound quality of these headphones and quickly picked up a pair after trying them out. I used them as the primary source of sound when at my computer for about two years before selling them off. While still impressed with the sound quality, the headphones just became too painful for me to wear. At first, it only hurt when worn for several hours at a time, but then it started to hurt faster and faster until it got the a point where I couldn't wear them longer than five minutes.In the two years though, the headphones lasted and stayed in fairly good shape with no cracks in the (faux?) leather."
1,Buy different headphones!,I've been spinning for about 8 years and I wanted to give these a shot. The sound is not too bad but you can buy something else with your money. If I have these on for about an hour they start to hurt my ears and head. They are pretty heavy for over the ear headphones too. Now the padding is starting to crack and chip away. I have to toss these out now. Do yourself a favor and buy another set of headphones.
2,Good sound; broke one month after the warranty expired,"The sound from these headphones is great. They have good bass without muddiness and good high range as well as volume. The sound isolation is decent, but not great.I had two major problems with these headphones: the pressure on my ears became uncomfortable after around 5 minutes and unbearable after an hour or so, but despite this, the headphones slipped off easily. More importantly, the headphones fell apart almost exactly a month after they were out of warranty. The connection between the ear cup and swivel completely cracked on one side and is starting to go on the other. I do not throw my headphones around or drop them, and for professional headphones, this performance is unacceptable. Sony should redesign these headphones."
3,"Solid cans, solid price, solid headache.","Short and sweet. They sound is a 4 at best, good lows, not too crisp though, and distort fairly easily. Cost is right on the money I think.... They are really rugged and just will not break if taken care of. Comes with a bag which helps. Nice long cable is sturdy and fold played adapter screws in tight.Con: can't wear them for extended periods of time... Really begin to hurt your head. But for DJ monitoring they are perfect!"
3,"Sound good, but there are better and more durable choices","I owned a pair of MDR-V700s for about two weeks before deciding to return them. Mostly I did so because of reviews I read here and elsewhere that panned these for lack of durability. After a bit of deliberation, I opted for the Sony MDR-V6s, which have been around for a long time and have earned a loyal fan base willing to attest to their sound quality and durability. You can find them online for less than the MDR-V700s, and I think they sound better too."
2,Very poor construction,"I'm not exactly a headphone connoisseur but I can tell you that these headphones have impressive sound. I upgraded from the standard issue ipod earbuds. The bass on these things is quite strong (its actually rather painful at anything too high). However, if you read the reviews for these things you will find that the common theme is that they break around the swivel thing. I was determined to be the dude who takes good care of his headphones and doesn't break them. NOT SO. Although these are some of the sexiest phones around, THEY ARE NOT MADE TO LAST. The plastic on the hinge/swivel device is completely inadequate for its purpose. Mine lasted only about a month. The sound still sounds fine, but the swivels are in shambles. DONT BUY THESE IF YOU WANT THEM FOR LONGER THAN A COUPLE OF MONTHS. FOR THE PRICE, THE LONGEVITY OF THESE IS A SHAME."
4,best headphones i've ever owned...,"The design is by far the best part of these headphones. They are very clean and appealing to the eye - and they fit on your skull like a glove. They seem fairly durable but who knows - they may break tomorrow... that would be a con.The sound is pretty clean and detailed at high volumes, but definitely distorts at very high volumes... especially with the bass up.Bass is not as impressive as you would hope for this price, but bass isn't everything. The full-range acoustics are nothing short of a amazing in comparison to other the cheap sets I've owned.Pros - style, fit, storage, crisp full soundCons - semi-fragile, poor bass, tight fit on head, distortion at high volumes** UPDATE **(December 24, 2012) These haven't broken yet - guess they aren't as fragile as I though. They still work great and have gone through mild abuse."
3,Panzer Compaigns Moscow 41,"This game is very tiedious. It is a grind it out type of action, which is true to the actual events it portrays, but is not fun."
5,Welcome to Paradise??,"Bubba Justice in Key West should be madatory for anyone planning to move to the Keys. It covers many of the actions of the Monroe County Government and its employees that have been perpetrated on the unbelieving residents of the Florida Keys. Some stories will make you laugh, most will make you cry when you see the absolute stupidity that passes for doing business in the county."
1,Bubbas laughing,This book does not truly follow through on its promise. It is poorly written and must have been vastly entertaining to the powers that be. You can get more out of a John Leslie or Laurence Shames mystery as to the workings of Bubbaville than from this book.
4,"Yes it's stupid, but...","It is a very stupid movie, but it has moments of great hilarity and Cleese is in great form. The who's the real Watson scene is worth the price of the DVD alone. Holmes:One of you is an imposter! Watson:Good Lord! Is it me?"
3,"4 stars for a good movie, minus 1 for film quality","Actually I'd have given this little gem '4 stars' but for the quality of the cd. It has very obviously been copied from a sub-standard VHS tape. It was an unpleasant surprise in an otherwise funny movie.As for the movie itself, very good. I liked the caricatures, the sight gags, the silliness. John Cleese, Arthur Lowe, Denholm Elliot, Connie Booth -- all good British actors and it was fun seeing them (and others) here. An untypical Sherlock Holmes film, with semi-mystery, semi-suspense, a wonderful Watson, and Cleese being Cleese. (A must watch for Cleese-ers is A FISH CALLED WANDA, where he proved once again in a classic scene that he can do more with facial expressions than many actors can do with a page full of lines.)I really enjoyed this film despite the shoddy quality. If you're a Cleese or even a Holmes fan, get it and have some fun."
2,VERY DISAPPOINTING! ! ! ! !,I guess I have to be in the right mind set for John Cleese. This one fell flat. I am trying to collect a variety of Sherlock Holmes but I could have easily left this one out of the collection. Didn't hate it but wouldn't recommend it either.
2,Very weak humor by John Cleese....Skip this one!,Very weak humor by John Cleese and we love him. This one you can skip. Try his Romance with a Double Bass instead.It is unusually unique and funny.
1,Save your money.,"I am a big fan of John Cleese and most anything he has ever done (Monty Python goes without saying). But this skit is absolutely horrible. There was about one funny scene (very short) where he is impersonating Kojak (Telli Savallis, excuse my spelling). I am very sorry I even spent the money on it. I would give it away, but its not even worth the shipping costs. Romance with a double bass was good (3 1/2 stars). Clockwise was also pretty good (3 1/2 stars as well). SORRY JOHN."
1,Don't Buy This Tape . . .,"It is awful--I mean it. It is worse than ""How To Irritate People"" and before I wasted the (money) on this I thought it would be impossible for Cleese to film something worse than ""Irritate"". You want to see John and Connie in their finest hours together?? Buy the complete set of ""Fawlty Towers."" It is their finest work."
1,This might have been the end of John Cleese's career.,"""The Strange Case of the End of Civilization As We Know It"" is the most awful exercise with which any Python has ever been associated. Nothing funny, nothing witty, nothing satirical, no jabs at authority or culture, and no entertainment value. At least ""Fawlty Towers"" is ugly, nasty, disspiriting, and a celebration of rudeness for the purpose of being cruel -- which is much nicer than anything one could say about ""The Strange Case . . . ."" The best non-Python Cleese is ""Romance with a Double Bass"" with the beautiful (and almost naked) Connie Booth."
5,no,"THis is the shortest movie but the funniest. It is about a bristh lad who has no Idea what he is doing abot solving mysteries. Actually, I made taht up. I'm completely insane. (Last 2 sentences may no be true) END"
5,The BEST WWE DVD in the world!!!!,This is by far the best documentary WWE has ever made. Last years Stone Cold was very good but this tops it. CM Punk Phillip Brooks is just so real in this blu~ray about his rise to become the BEST wrestler in the world. The stories people talk about from Colt Cabana to Lita and Lars from Rancid and so on just great. The extras on the blu ray are great loved the choices of matches loved the video game challenge versus Kofi very funny *spoiler* really liked the end of credits when Punk does a tribute to a great 80's movie made in Chicago.
5,Best In the World!,I'm currently watching this wonderful bluray and I have to say this is the best documentary WWE has ever released. I love how Punk goes into complete detail about his highs and lows. I love the ROH footage and what I love about this release you see the full entrances. They don't go straight to the matches like other releases.I've been a CM Punk for ten years and I have all of his ROH stuff WWE and TNA stuff. I have to say he finally made it!In shorter words JUST BUY IT!! He pretty much handpicked who he wanted to talk on the documentary part of the video. From Chris Hero to Kofi Kingston to Joey Mercury childhood friends Colt Cabana. I'm from Chicago and it's pretty awesome to see Punk go through Chicago.I love this purchase to death and I surely don't regret it. Worth every penny folks!
5,Excellent.,By far and away one of the best and most comprehensive WWE produced videos. I was surprised by the answers CM Punk and others gave in this video. It shows WWE in a different light than most of their videos allow. Of course you will not get the same realism that you would in an RFVideo or ROH production. But a very good video I hope this trend continues for WWE. Great job to CM Punk Best in the world.
2,Boring,I had really high expectations for this documentary after all the hype but I have to admit I was less than thrilled. Yes it is always interesting to learn the story of a superstar but usually they're a bit more exciting than this one. I found it very matter-of-fact and bland. Disappointed.
5,great value,"was just what the description said, great features, good length for the money, it was just what he asked for, for Christmas. thank you"
4,CULT?,"The following of Ayn Rand is a not a ""cult."" As rational people, we should be able to draw the distinction. About this book: while it is certainly interesting, Rand was never a feminist. Though the authors try, its a stretch. Nevertheless, its good reading."
5,A sensible plan for reviewing what's important in life,"A terrific book by someone who has waged the battle of hype and accumulation, yet realized there's more clarity and virtue on the side of less-is-more. This year-long odyssey of personal review is the backbone of ""Give It Up!"", and throughout the process, the author shows her grit and genuine commitment to finding out what's truly valuable. Plenty of ""me-too"" flashes accompany the author's insights, which makes you realize that maybe, just maybe, this journey along the road less accessoried is the right path."
2,Lightweight and Frivolous,"Oh my God! No taxis! No chocolate! No gourmet coffee! This book is a good example of why much of the world hates Americans. When I ordered the book, I thought it would be much more substantive, a tale of the author's quest for meaning and spirituality amid the junkyard of materialism that make up a lot of American lives these days. Instead, each chapter could have been a synopsis of a ""Sex and the City"" episode. I don't totally pan the book because the author has a breezy writing style that is somewhat entertaining. If you share the author's contention that being forced to wear sensible shoes instead of stilletos for a month is a life-altering experience, then this book is for you. If not, take a pass."
2,Not what I expected,This book wasn't what I expected. I really wanted to know what the impact of giving something up would do to someone's life. In many of the months you get the feeling that the author wishes she had not decided to see what it would be like to give something up. I never gathered the benefits from her giving something up. I did however read a lot of pissing and moaning. Can't say I would recommend this one.
1,Don't Bother,"I didn't buy this book, I checked it out from the library. It was so bad that I couldn't even finish it. All I can do is sit here and wonder who Mary Carlomagno knew to get this drivel published."
4,Give It Up!: My Year of Learning to Live Better with Less,"I found this book to be light, funny and entertaining. The author's recount of giving up one thing in her life each month is observational, enlightening and amusing. She's just going through the experience, not to be able to prove or espouse anything, but rather, to just have the experience and see how, and where, it impacts her life. I really enjoyed it for what it was clearly meant to be--simply a sharing of a chosen experience in someone's life."
2,She gives up what most people in the world can't even afford!,"Cell phone, cable TV, gourmet coffee, manicures, taxis...get real! Don't waste your time on this silly book."
3,Good Message But Has an Elitist Perspective,"This is a fun, acessible book. It is good to read and think about if you are living a fast paced middle class lifestyle. HOWEVER her focus on this project seems to be more for emotional clarity. While this is a good goal in mind, this in itself is elitist form a ""more with less"" mentality. It does pose issues that would make people think about slowing down their life and their consumption. While this can provide emotional clarity, there is also serious questions about people living in poverty and the state of our enviornment that she does not really examine as much that revolve around living better with less.People who enjoyed this book would also probably enjoy Simplify Your Life: 100 Ways to Slow Down and Enjoy the Things That Really Matter by Elaine St. James for more suggestions about more ways to live better with less. Affluenza is also a reccomended read which is more accessible on the other complex issues behind this issue as well."
5,Take your resolutions a bite at a time,"Mary offers a new and fresh perspective at this time of year when a 365-day resolution seems daunting. Try one on, a month at a time. With her candid and often sassy voice, she shares her triumphs and pitfalls. A delightful gift to anyone facing a ""monumental"" birthday or looking to make some changes and kickstart their life. You'll enjoy the time you spend in Mary's company!"
3,nice inspiration- somewhat obvious,"I was inspired, but it was a rather pedestrian experiment. Nothing revolutionary. But a nice quick read! Very fun.I certainly enjoyed the read."
2,"Great sound, but painful to use for longer than a few minutes!","I got these to replace my broken Sony EX-71's.The good: the sound is better, MUCH better than the Sony phones.The bad: as a result of using a larger driver (which produces the improved sound quality), the earphones themselves are larger (fatter and longer). After a few minutes my ears really hurt, as the ""fat"" earphones don't fit nearly as comfortably as the Sony phones.So, I decided to sacrifice sound quality for comfort, and just bought some Sony EX-75's for about $20 through Amazon.If you are used to using the small or medium Sony eartips, these earphones will probably hurt. If you use the large tips, you might (?) be OK with these..."
2,Not nearly what I expected,"Bought these at a 20 low price which raised questions for me after hearing their performance.Significantly less bass than earbuds 1/3rd the list price of these.The narrow, in-ear, design reduces base performance over cheaper, wider diaphrams, and that might have been a factor.I would not recommend these if you are looking for good, full-range responseI returned them to the vendor, but was still out shipping both ways, alas."
2,good things don't always last..,"These are good sounding earbuds, sound good as far as I can tell, isolate from noise very well, great for use on planes, they are fairly priced. However, mine broke after 5 month of use, now I hear only on one side and there are cracks in the plastic. Haven't treated them badly either, so next time I'll go back to Sennheisser."
5,Ford steering wheel,The Ford Racing steering wheel is truly beautiful. Great leather feels like you have complete control. installed it myself. need steering wheel puller to complete. fits and looks great. Ross
1,Poorly Written and Depressing,"Wow. And I thought Leona Helmsley was 'The Queen of Mean' ...? Like most of America, I grew up loving the comedy of Paul Lynde and lived for his little short appearances here and there -- from Doris Day movies to Hollywood Squares. But if this book is even half way true, he was certainly one miserable individual. Too bad he flamed out like he did because he apparently did have a great deal of talent.All I can say about this book is, ""ohhhh, my good-nessssssssss...."""
2,Poorly written with little insight.,"I thought this book would be interesting; it is not. It is poorly written, story lines are not developed and even when it does cover an interesting topic, it just falls flat.Paul Lynde had to be more interesting than this book makes him out to be. I would suggest it only if you have trouble falling asleep at night."
3,Truthful but sad account of Paul's life,"I got this book when it first came out. I read Peter Marshall's book, so I knew about Paul's seedy side and what I was getting into with this one. Lynde loved to drink and when he had too much, his dark side emerged. The liquor covered for his insecurities. I used to watch him on Hollywood Squares during the 70s, he always seemed happy and the life of the party. Yeah, it's called acting.While I wanted to sympathise with Paul, it was very hard to do, given that he brought most of these sad things upon himself. He obviously was no saint, and I thought that maybe if he'd gotten some therapy, it might have prolonged his life and changed his outlook on it, I must agree with others that this book is a difficult read, especially if you were a fan of Lynde, like I was."
2,Don't Believe The Title,There is no story of a dominatrix! I expected scenes of true domination. There were only a few short scenes of her dressed like a dominatrix and only 1 scene where she acted like one for a short period of time. It is a story of revenge and murder. Not a dominatrix.
3,FRUIT TREE SPRAY,"THIS IS THE SECOND YEAR I HAVE USED THIS SPRAY. THE FIRST YEAR I MIXED AS RECOMMENDED ON CONTAINER. - CHERRIES HAD WORMS. THIS YEAR I MIXED 1 1/2 TIMES RECOMMENDED - STILL HAD WORMS IN CHERRIES. PEAR, APRICOT, PEACHES, PLUMS & NECTARINES WERE ALL - NO WORMS - BOTH YEARS."
5,fully satisified,"I purchased the memory for my dying Dell Inspiron 1100 laptop.The memory extension worked miracles, and now I can use it again.As for the provider I've got nothing but praise: fast secure shipment at a reasonable price."
3,"Comfortable Headphones, But Made With Inferior Material","I have been using these headphones for 3.5 years now - and I really love so much about them. I'm not an ""audiophile"" but I think the sound quality is good. I have big ears and these headphones are VERY comfortable to wear. The long cord really comes in handy at times.The downside is that there is a cheap plastic coating on the ear-cup and over-head band portions of the headphones. This black plastic cracks and flakes off over time. I have no hair, so when I have little black plastic flakes on my head it really stands out. People look at me funny and say ""You have something on you...."" and try not to look grossed out.So the pluses are just enough to outweigh the minuses and keep me from chucking this black-plastic-shedding pain in the @$$, but just barely.Edit: I really hate this cheap material. If I could I would reduce this rating to 1 or 2 stars. I would not recommend these to anybody who wants their headphones to last more than 1 year."
2,Not horrible not good just okay,"I have owned these headphones for many years now. They are comfortable to wear for about an hour or so, but any longer and my ears start to get uncomfortably hot. They do fold up nicely but they are just too big to be portable in my opinion. The vinyl on the earpads and headband deteriorated and was a little messy but they still work. They are not the best sounding headphones as they produce slightly boomy upper-frequency bass and really lack detail in the midrange but the highs are nice and not too bright. You can get a pair of Sony earbuds for less than half the price that sound much better, provide more isolation, and are a lot lighter. Also, the cord is heavy and tends to make my head lean to the left if it is hanging down in front of me. I still use them occasionally when I don't feel like having earbuds stuck in my ears but there are better choices available for less money."
2,V6 vs V600,Yes it's true the V6 has a better tone. That's why I didn't buy the 7506 Too Bassey/Muddy. I'm a radio personality and throughout the 70s and early 80s I used a variety of phones but mostly used variations of sony headphones. I like a crisp clear sound with real bass kick not a booming muddy bass like the 7506. I was introduced to the MDR V6 around 92. I was told it was accurate except it had a slight boost in the upper mid range but not enough to muddy up the highs or screw up the clear bass. About 10 years later and still working great my v6s were stolen. I accidentally bought a v600 that's when i knew there was a difference. I suggest you try both. I prefer the v-6 like most of my dj colleagues use.
2,cheap sounding headphones,"I paid a hundred bucks for these a couple of years ago thinking they had replaced the classic mdr-v6. Not true, thank god, because these phones are pretty lousy. The bass is loud and boomey, instead of tight and focused on the v6's. The midrange is also sub-par for $100.00 phones. Its no better than the midrange on my old mdr-v180's, Which cost about $30.00. For around a hundred bucks, you're much better off going with the sony mdr-v6. they are harder to find in stores, but can still be found all over the internet. strongley advise against these."
3,"They sound great, I just had an unlucky experience","I have had these headphones before, and strongly recommend them. The last pair that I had lasted until they were stolen (hot commodity ;c)The pair I purchased from Amazon had something rattling around in the earpiece, but other than that was in great functioning condition, and still sounded great.I would definitely recommend these (I've owned 3 pair in my life, and the first I had for 4 years with NO problems). Take care of them, and they could last forever."
5,Excellent headphones,"I am on my third set on this model. They have each lasted about 10 years with heavy use. The first part to wear out is the inner ear pads with flaking. They are replaceable for $12.00. Both of the previous units developed shorts in the cord probably from my inadvertent pulling on the cord. They are lightweight, comfortable and just as good soundwise as the more expensive Sennheisers. Highly recommended."
4,Nice...,"They sound like high-end Sony headphones, what more need I say?Well since I have a tiny little head (pinhead), it would be nice to have them a little tighter."
4,Delivers!,"I am very pleased with these headphones. They are comfortable, seem well built and the sound is incredible. The ear coverage and foam thickness almost makes them noise cancelling. And the sound is GREAT! I'm not an expert but I love being able to hear it all....and with these great headphones you can."
5,Best Headphones Ever!,"This is actually the second pair of Sony MDR-V600 headphones I've purchased. The first pair lasted eight years, which is really something because I wear headphones 40 hours a week at work. Superb sound, superb durability, superb headphones!"
2,Ear cups fall apart after regular use,"Initial sound quality was outstanding. However, after several months of regular use, both ear cups started to deteriorate to a point where you could see the bare foam. I would have expected much better quality from Sony. If you're looking for a long lasting quality headphone, I would look to other top brands, such as Sennheiser."
5,the only headphone i use,"this headphone is very good, I use this headphone everyday, the sound that comes out of this headphone is just amazing, the sound is very clear and loud enough for your enjoyment, I would definitely recommend this headphone."
5,Sony Headphones,"I've been in radio broadcasting for over 40 years.Sony MDR-V600 Studio Monitor Series Headphones. The Sony MDR-V600 phones not only sound the best, they last for years! This is the second pair of headphones I've owned in my career...THANKS SONY!"
4,Had to return these,"i had to return these after one day because they were huge on the ears. there was no way to adjust the headband, so it kept falling off my head. i got irritated so i just returned it.sound quality was pretty good, but i didnt have them long enough to say anything else about this."
4,Worth the Money,"I was very tentative of buying this product, but following a friend's advice, I decided to buy a pair. These headphones are extremely comfortable and completely surround my ears with euphoria. I graded the sound 4-stars just because I expected more powerful base to come from them. But after listening to them for a while, you become comfortable with the sound that it produces. The plastic components are very light, which attributes the headphone set a fragile feel / appearance. Overall, this set of headphones is worth the money."
1,Awful. Just awful.,"I do not know how the MDR-V600's have managed to get 4 stars from people who actually use them.I bought a pair a few years ago, when my old pair of MDR-V6's decided they'd had enough. I logically thought that the MDR-V600's would be the natural replacement. Man, was I wrong. Compared to the V6's, the sound of the V600's is absoutely awful. Midrange is pure tin, and low-end is pure mud. Not only that, the phones themselves are awkwardly big and clunky.I immediately went out and bought two more pairs of MDR-V6's, the best headphones I've ever used (and I've used many). The V6's are comfortable for long-term wear. and the sound is, in my opinion, without flaw.If you're looking for a good pair of headphones, then I implore you to steer clear of the MDR-V600's, and go right for a pair of MDR-V6's! Their model numbers may be similar but they are at opposite ends of the quality scale. You will not be sorry with a pair of V6's."
3,Alone!,"Great sound for these ears that have experienced to much Jimmy Hendrix Live and to close to the stage!Would be better if there was an in line volume control.Very comfortable. Could wear them for the whole day with no side affects.Great for Centerpointe Holosync recordings. The experience of this technological meditation is super!At first... thought that I had purchased a headset with the wrong connector. Out of the box it had a big plug in for an amp. I thought I saw on the website that it came with a iPodable connection. I was ready to call Sony and find out if I was missing someting, when low and behold I discovered that the large connector simply screwed off to reveal the connector that I needed and wanted."
4,Great Deal,"I was very pleased with the sound quality and comfortability of these headphones. However, they are made of a light plastic, these arent phones i would bring traveling cause i wouldnt wanna break em... well see how my investment has payed off."
5,Cant go wrong really...,"These are my 3rd pair because I am not smart and leave them on the floor after a night of drinking and step on them. But great headphones, I keep coming back to them. I use turtle beach px5 for my gaming and movies and these for computer and ipod. It wont duplicate the px5 with surround sound in console games but more than good enough to listen to music or hook up to computer to browse and such. If your looking for good quality and don't mind spending a little bit of money by all means look at these!"
5,Great!,Not bad for used! The product itself is a high quality product. No hz difference in left/right etc. I've used Sony headphones almost exclusively due to their quality of sound.
4,Pretty Good Set of Headphones,"When I purchased the headphones I was concerned about the comfort of the set, as many people complained it hurt their ears. I have normal sized ears and have had absolutely no discomfort at all. The sound of the headphones is best described as better than average. Compared to smaller headphones and earbuds, the sound is substantially better. Compared to a great set of phones, it is still sounds thin and ""tin-y."" The bass response is rather lacking in the set. The cord is long and does not show any indication that it will easily break, and the overall construction is solid. Overall, it's probably not worth the price I paid for them, but they are better than what I had before. I'd say these are worth 40 dollars or so, not the 70 dollars they charge for them."
3,Don't confuse this with actual high fidelity,"I bought the Sony MDR-V600 to block out noise at work. I knew I didn't want to spend alot just to do that, but when I tried them out I'm not so sure I made the right decision.For years I have listened to my beloved Sennheiser HD580 at home, and when I first listened to the MDR-V600 I knew the sound was not nearly as good. Going back and forth confirmed the amazing clarity of the HD580 and the muddiness of the MDR-V600. The price difference is quite large, so this is not a really fair comparison, but when you read the glowing reviews for the MDRV600 keep in mind that if you want really fine quality these are not the cans you are looking for."
3,Upon further review...,"After having had many other headphones of far superior quality to these, I'll say these were okay for the price. Nothing spectacular, but not awful either."
4,"great for the airplane, but a little tinny sounding","The headphone cup that goes around your ear is nice for the plane because it eliminates much of the ambient noise that causes jet-lag lethargy, but if you want a better audio experience buy the Sony MDR V700 headphones. They are a little less cuppy on your ear, but the sound is far superior."
4,MDR-V600 and modification,"I have both the MDR-7506 and the MDR-V600. While the V600s are good, it has more bass response than the 7506, in my opinion, so I wouldn't use it for recording.There is a modification that you can make to remove the foam in the driver and reduce the bass response. I've tried it and it appears to work:Post note: Hmmm. Amazon didn't include my link to the modification. Google ""MDR-V600 modification"" and click on the search results: ""Interesting mod for the Sony MDR-V600"""
3,"Excellent sound for Money, Very Cheap Construction","I've always owned Sony Headphones over the Years, I bought my first pair of the MDR V600's about 3 years ago, and they have served me very well until that one day my amp clipped, and out went one of the drivers. I ordered a brand new pair and when they arrived, the first thing I noticed was the cord was much thinner then my old pair. they lasted a week before loose connections developed, lucky the good folks at amazon.com sent me a new pair rigt out, they worked great for about a week, and now I'm back in the same boat. loose connections. Needless to say I will be asking for my money back, and will be exploring other brands. Time to give up on Sony. They never made decent equipment, but did make great headphones, I guess they are using the same care with headphones that they use with there other equipment which makes them just a BAD PURCHASE, be-ware Sony is not the great company they make themselves out to be."
4,"Old model, but great design","I have gone through many headphones. These by far are the loudest. You can crank them up and use them as desktop speakers they are so loud. Design is extremeley sturdy. I was reccommended by 4 DJ's who use these to buy them. I have been through other Sony's, Pioneers and Denons. A lot of these other models all have breaking points. Most Sony's are rugged and usually the only problems I would have were wearing out the ear pads till they came off. These so far are the most durable for packing and traveling. Only thing I am interested in newer models , are possible replacable ear pads and cords. But these are excellent for the price."
2,Not such a great value,"Just replacing earpads on both an old pair of PRO60's and MDR-V600's - I listened to both before ordering (although only $5 delivered for PRO60 pads and $40 for Sony pads - yikes!) and the MDR-V600's just don't sound half as good - kind of hollow - good highs (which is bad if the middle is missing), nothing in the middle, not much lows (""bass""). I appreciate good sound and am pretty picky - high end Onkyo receiver, Mission and Wharfedale speakers, etc. And price isn't everything (some of the best sound I've ever heard is from an old JC Penney receiver (made by Technics) on some old Realistic speakers!). But these are no bargain. I'm not spending $40 to replace these earpads! LOVE the PRO60's though!!"
5,good phones,At first I thought these phones were defective or crap as others have posted. Bass was vibrating them off my head. I then consulted my brother - a musician who used them in the studio - and he suggested adjusting the equalizer on my media player. These phones are excellent for the price.
2,Poor quality,"My first pair lasted 16 years. Somewhere along the line, Sony decided to make the plastic film covering the ear pads thinner, that they would wear out after a year or so and need replacing. Most of their headphones are designed this way. After a few months, the ear pads come apart at the seams. Within a year, bits of black plastic will begin to tear off and stick to your face. Within two years, the ear pads will be completely shredded.These are low-quality, overpriced headphones. You will do better with other brands."
5,Amazing,"Incredible headphones. I'm not an expert on sound like some of the other reviewers, but I love to listen to music. My office can get a bit noisy at times and these headphones do the trick.After a full 8 hours my ears are a little tired from the headphones sitting on them, but I usually don't wear them all day. The ear covers are soft and made from a very comfortable material. The sound is amazing! I think I can hear more music through these headphones than I do my stereo system at home.Cable has two adapters to fit most sized jacks. It is long enough to plug into my PC and still give me room to work comfortably and move around from phone to filing cabinet and back to PC with no troubles.Great buy, I am really impressed with these headphones. Highly recommended."
5,This is great for it's price,I am a freelance camera operator and sometimes I end up having to edit projects. Since I don't edit often I did not want to spend lots of money on studio headphones but at least wanted something that would cancel out the outside world when I edited and this does just that. I was so impressed I took it out in the field with me on sets and it's great. I can't hear anything unless someone talks into the microphone going to the camera which is great. I love these headphones.
5,Great Sound,This is an excellent pair of headphones. They're extremely comfortable and produce great sound. I could wear them all day. I'm just a guy who likes to listen to his music and for me they're great. You'll hear things you never did before in your music and probably grow to be annoyed with any MP3 collection you have. Unless they're ripped well you'll hear pops and hissing very often. Be forewarned. It's not the headphones. It's your crappy MP3 files. ;)
2,WAY overpriced...earpads and headband peel and flake,"I bought this model at Best Buy for about half of what they're selling for on Amazon, but even at that price they cost way too much for what you get. I think a fair price would be closer to $50-$60.The headphones have decent sound, I can't say it's ""monitor"" quality, but good enough for general hi-fi and mp3 listening.BEWARE: after a while the synthetic ""leather"" fabric that covers the ear-cups and the headband will break down and flake off, it will get all over in your hair and clothes. You will need to buy and install replacement ear-pads which can be found online (unfortunately there are no replacement headbands available).Sound Quality: C+Ergonomics: B+Fit & Finish: AQuality Materials: DValue: D-Bottom Line: There are much better deals out there."
3,Great sound. Failing Earpads.,"I have had these headphones for about 5 years. The sound is excellent and I used them for on-air radio work and audio production without a hitch. Sometime during year #4, the thin plastic covering over the foam earpieces began to peel off. It has continue over time - so I now have chihuahua headphones!I contacted the manufacturer, but they would not stand behind the product because it was out of the warranty period. In my opinion, in or out of warranty, this type of situation should not occur - especially with a reputable manufacturer like SONY."
2,What Happend? Used to Be Great,"My last two pair of these head phones broke in the same place on the ear cuff with a piece of tiny plastic breaking inside of the round barrel on top of the ear piece.Now, there is a piece of plastic which rolls around inside of the barrel.Despite this continuing problem, I liked the sound quality very much and ordered another pair.The rich middle range and solid bass are gone.Lots of high end treble thin sound emphasis. They do not sound the same as the last previous pair. I will probably look at other brands next time or be sure thatI can try them on in a store to test them out before purchasing."
4,Built to last,"I use these for dj'ing, and have run them for several years. The only thing that I had happen, is the thin covering over the earphones, and also on the headband will deteriorate and come off in little pieces. I finally took some duct tape and used it like a lint roller to pull the remaining covering off because I would come home with little black pieces of material all over my head and clothes. Since I use them in loud environments, I can't really comment on sound quality. They do block some sound (a little less now that the covering came off), which helps in loud areas. The cord is coiled, and long, it has stretched out over time, so it's really long now, just make sure you don't wrap the cord around the phones tightly."
4,Medical Spanish,"I'm a recently retired Spanish teacher and have been asked to volunteer at our local hospital. I was afraid that I wouldn't know all the medical terminology necessary. This is an easy to-use-guide full of necessary information, but a knowledge of Spanish would be helpful to use it. There are some small errors, but nothing that would seriously affect communication. BE CAREFUL! If you use these phrases, the Spanish-speaker will answer in sentences. What do you do then? Ask ""yes"" and ""no"" questions!!!"
5,An upbeat tale of finding one's hidden strengths,"George Shannon's Tippy-Toe Chick, GO! is an engaging and recommended children's picturebook about a resourceful little yellow chick who must use her cleverness and speed to outwit a fierce dog that is blocking the way to food for her whole family. An upbeat tale of finding one's hidden strengths told with singsong prose and illustrated in vibrant colors by Laura Dronzek."
5,Tippy Toe Chick Go,"This is a perfect book. The author packs an amazing amount of story per word - all with fun-to-read rhythm. The illustrations are great, too - priceless expressions on the poultry. Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful."

2,Can only cool a small room,"Bought this air conditioner for my mom. Very disappointed. It takes a very long time for the unit to provide cool air and also, it can only be effective in a very small room. It remains to be seen how long this unit will last. My recommendation is to purchase a unit from a more reputable/proven name brand."
5,2 cd set of my favorite artist.,"Now we have a good chance to buy something like this.We'll enjoy more time listening to ""el maestro""."
4,excellent introduction to Spanish-language literature,"I enjoyed working through this book, but suspect it is a bit more than 'intermediate' in its target audience. The range of stories is very good and includes a couple of classics. Both Spain and Spanish-speaking America are included. The endnotes are variable in value. There is a glossary at the end but a good dictionary will come in handy as well. On the whole, a helpful and informative collection."
4,Great Scaled Earth Mover,"I purchased the 1/50 Scaled Earth Mover for my son who is taking an interest in construction vehicles. The vehicle is smaller than what I was expecting, but it has amazing detail. The vehicle is more of a collector's item than an every day play toy. Overall it was a good purchase for a Christmas present."
1,This doesn't work,I have this prodcut and I just bought it yesterday. It doesn't work! don;t buy the sally hansen express wax kit either. It doesn't work. Other products of sally hansen works better than this one. It doesn't stick to my hair and I made every possible tricks I know to make it stick. It doesn't.
2,Made in USA cost Made in China quality,"Lousy performance overall, stays sharp for 3 cuts then dulls out... Milwaukee has them made in China which accounts for the sub-standard quality... Can't we build anything in the USA anymore?"
1,Worthless,"This book is great for someone who already knows Quantum Mechanics and wants a quick review, but absolutely worthless for someone trying to learn it for the first time. I had already worked with David J. Griffiths book so I had a handle on the subject and ended up teaching most of the rest of the class the material. The author skips over all the insight worthwhile example and just presents algebra (which he skips most of the steps as one would expect) which in the end doesn't lead to anything most of the time. Over all, go with Griffiths if you want to learn the material and just avoid this book."
3,Not Hardcover!,"Be advised - this is NOT a hardcover, despite the product description. This is a SOFTCOVER book.I can't find anything on the publisher's site that indicates that it's even available as hardcover, so it's not as if you have a choice. However, you should know what you're getting."
5,A Great Thorough Class,"I found this cd to be deep and relaxing. The flow was consistent and I found Jon's instruction to be inspiring, enlightening, and soothing. This is a great class for anyone wanting a home practice. I have tried other yoga cds and this was the only cd that motivated me to do yoga at home."
2,Microphone is the weak point,This product almost had it all. They need to A: Insert a better microphone so your party can hear you. Or B: Extend the boom so that the microphone is right infront of your mouth. This product falls short of what it needs to do and therefore not a viable solution. I really wanted to like this product too. I do not like having to charge yet another item (wireless bluetooth earpiece).
2,good until it breaks,It worked well for the price until it broke. People where able to hear me clearly and I could hear them. Unfortunately it broke after a couple months of use.
1,"Poor quality, Plantronics brand is slipping.","Out of the package this headset was cutting in and out. My previous experience with Plantronics has been great. However, their quality seems to be slipping. The cord of this headset is tightly wound and tied when packaged. It is not a thick cord, so I am not surprised there was frayed wiring. Disappointing."
5,No Problems,"Been using it for a week now, and no problems, audio and mic are exceptional. I can drive with the windows down and have a conversation."
4,A Great Little Headset,This lightweight little headset has two wearing options -- neither of which tangle into and pull hair-- volume adjustment and transmits clear sound both ways. Cannot evaluate its longevity yet but so far I am very happy.
5,A Special Set of Headphones,"I love these headphones. The sound is great. I have a lot of trouble with headphones. I can where them for a couple of hours but then they begin to annoy me. After 3-4 hours most headphones will give me a headache. This headphones, I can use for tons of hours and never even begin to be annoyed by their presents.They are bulky, but well worth it. I've bought two pairs (one for work and home)."
1,Bad design.,"We bought this unit several months ago, knowing that the CD door would break easily. Instead of breaking, it just stopped working. We're now on our 4th unit. On 2 the the CD door stopped working. One wouldn't even spin up a CD. It sounds good, looks sleek and has a nice alarm system, but it's a poor design and JVC has been anything but helpful. Not recommended."
1,Alabama car coaster,"I did not like this coaster. The bottom bevels up, so the coffee cup tilts when you accelerate and brake, spilling the coffee :("
5,Great Weight Training DVD!,"I have a lot of ""the Firm"" type weight training videos but was looking for something new and different. I am so glad I read the reviews and purchased this DVD! Erin is an upbeat, encouraging instructor. Some of the exercises are standards (bicep curls) but she has some new-to-me exercises on the floor portion of the routine. I love that there are variations to each exercise so you can increase the difficulty as you become stronger. I would purchase this again in a heartbeat!"
5,"Strong Body, Ageless body works","I am 64. I walk regularly but seldom do other exercises. Erin O'Brien's routines are fun and challenging. I am working toward balancing on my butt, this is one of the challenges and completing the program in one session, that is my other challenge. She is easy to follow and does not over explain."
2,Not for those with knee trouble,"This workout is not for those with knee problems since it is basically one set of squats after another, with some deep lunge sets thrown in between.I was kind of disappointed because I saw Erin on PBS and loved her attitude and enjoyed the routine- I was under the impression she was aiming at the a little bit older audience but I can no longer handle the deep knee bends so this routine is a no-go for me."
5,exactly what I need...a kick in the pants!,"Like most of the other reviews, I really liked this video. That is if you can like a video that makes muscles you didn't know you had quiver!!I am overweight and couldn't quite make it through the entire video. I found that incouraging not discouraging. I could do almost all of the lower level-impact exercises. I had difficulty with the floor ones. Even though they were difficult, I can see myself being able to actually do these in the future. Some videos I have tried I wouldn't have even attempted to do the excercise--not so with this instructor.The video does scan in and out and goes to black and white. Personally, I did not find this distracting.Overall, I was VERY impressed with this video and would recommend it to my friends. Especially friends that are overweight and need additional strengthening exercises."
3,Too Fast!,I should have listened to some of the other reviews I read on this dvd. Erin moves too fast from one move to another and doesn't keep a correct count on the leg moves. I do have a hard time with squats and lunges and getting the form right but they were very fast and most of the leg work were these two moves. There is some floor leg work also. I am not a beginner but could not keep up with her. I do feel worked out though and I only used 5 pound weights for the upper body. Maybe this is for more advanced exercisers than me.
3,Not for Beginners,This take was not for beginners or seniors. I could not keep up with the pace or the amount of reps she did. I think this would be a good tape for someone who is in moderate shape.
4,So Good For You,"This DVD gets you moving right away. The exercise routines feature workouts for all body parts. Not much space is needed so you can easily do it at home. It takes about 45 minutes and the only equipment needed is a couple of dumbbells and, perhaps, a mat. The main ingredient is a willingness to stay in shape no matter your age. Enjoy!"
4,great workout; intensely irritating camera work,"What O'Brien does is fine--a good workout, but the camera people couldn't leave well enough alone. Ordinary color switches to black and white, then to pseudo-colorized, and on many of these, they use a filter meant to suggest an old dusty film--bits of hair, blebs, flaws. The plain color photography is fine, but all the pseudo-artistic fiddles are intensely irritating. They make me very reluctant to use this DVD."
1,too busy,"This video was too manic for me. It's exercise for someone with a short attention span. They keep all the screen shots so busy by shooting over to a black and white shot or a picture in picture shot. Oh, now wait...you're looking up at the instructor from the floor! This style really took away from me trying to learn the form of the exercises. I wasn't able to finish the entire routine and I can say not ever finishing an exercise video I've paid money for is a first."
5,Love it !! Love it !!,"I love this dvd. The workout focuses on the the muscles, the cardio is added in a low rate. She has 4 upper body workouts and 3 on the mat. Erin is happy, encouraging and down to earth. Her music is nice and the setting is great. My results are amazing, my husband loves them. I am toned but in a feminine way."
3,Not what I expected,"I was looking for a slower pace strength training DVD for seniors but this is definitely not it. I'm sure it would be good for people who are already into strength training.I'll pack it away and get it back out when I'm more experienced (in a few years, LOL!)"
5,My New Favorite Workout!!!,"I own over 30 workout videos and this is my new favorite by far. It is honestly like having your own personal trainer in your living room! Erin is a great instructor. Her cuing is excellent and she explains the benefits to the moves which really helps to keep you from giving up. What I really love, though, is that she keeps motivating you throughout--""You can do it!"" She kept me going with a smile on my face and a sense of accomplishment at the end. Also, she makes sure your back is supported throughout and that you are in proper alignment. This is great for me after having back surgery--this workout did not strain my back at all! It's a great total body workout. You will definitely feel it the next day. Lots of different, inventive moves not found in other workout videos to target specific muscles. As someone who used to be in great shape and is trying to get back there, I feel like this workout will help me accomplish that. Highly recommended!"
5,Great workout,"This is a wonderful workout for someone getting back into shape. Keeps you out of breath, but not so much that you can't go on. I highly recommend it."
5,Great,"Great workout for this 50-year old man.In my opinion this video is a better weight-training workout than Erin's newer video Strong Body, Fit Body,especially when you include the intermediate level combinations in the side panel.But Strong Body, Fit Body is a better cardio workout,so altering between the two videos should yield an excellent, varied combination.Enjoy!Mark"
3,"Exercises good, commentary really annoying","The exercises in this video were very good. A lot of her speech included moaning, and comments such as ""give it to me now,"" that were so annoying that I probably won't buy it. I tried using it without sound, which isn't as easy in an exercise video. Also, I didn't like how they did a shadow image of her when showing exercise, I need to see entire person, not just one part. It seemed to be that the producers were adding style that wasn't helpful.I like the commentary in Kelly Coffey Meyer DVDs much better and the GO step commentary also."
2,Started Out Interesting -- But the 'hero' is never redeemed,"The premise of Moonlight Becomes Her sounded interesting enough and it started out interesting as well, but it does not continue through with its promise. Her hero and heroine never seem to emotionally connect and I can not figure out how he is even a hero in the first place. Rafe Belloch isspoiled [and]treats people like dirt -- his 'love' interest Mystere (who has it bad enough as it is) included."
2,Not up to par,"I purchased this book hoping that it would be as wonderful as ""Lions & Lace"". What a disappointment! Although set in the same time and place,the main characters and storyline were nothing alike. Rafe and Mystere were thrown together by fate and the story surrounding their eventual love is pretty boring. Their relationship did not have any ... tension and I was not drawn into it at all. I must say, however, Ms.McKinney did paint an exciting picture of NYC in the l880's."
5,"""OK"" ... I am hooked!","I have found this book, like almost all of Meagan McKinney's books, impossible to put down. I read it in one sitting. The only thing that bothers me about the book is that the ending left too many unanswered questions, definitely paving the way for a sequel. Unfortunately, noting that this book was released in 2002, my research indicates that Ms. McKinney has not as yet completed one. I can only hope that her literary agent and publisher somehow read this, so that they will pass along to Ms. McKinney that her fans are waiting with bated breathe for the sequel to ""Moonlight Becomes Her"". This story must continue!"
2,Disappoinment in the Moonlight,"I loved McKinney's FAIR IS THE ROSE, but this book was a big disappointment. I didn't get to know, or like Rafe or Mystere, and if I don't like the characters, I don't like the book.The events in the book didn't seem plausible, and that was distracting,too. It didn't make any sense that Mystere could be comfortable in such a bad part of town, robbing the rich with her vile companions, and within two years she's gone to charm school and becomes this perfect lady. How did that happen?"
1,one of the worst batteries ever made,I bought many sets for my speelites and noticed they didnt hold a charge very long. I bought the la crosse charger which test batteries and they tested between 60 and 1500 mah and they claim to be 2700. these batteries should be taken off the market! the only cool thing about the company was that they refunded me my money.
1,Dead after less than a year and three uses,"I used these as backup batteries in my canon flash. I used them three times and tried a fourth time and they were dead ~11 months from purchase.Seems like pretty premature death to me, but R.I.P.-offdd"
1,CTA DB-27AA AA batteries,"I bought these batteries from another source not on Amazon in the fall of 2010 and was excited at the 2700 mAh ratings. Now a year later the 4 pack I bought are worthless... won't charge or hold a charge for more than a few photos.I had bought other re-chargeable batteries from ""well known"" brands during the same time frame and all still function very well.Will not be buying CTA products again..."
5,This is the best wrap for me,"I need to wrap my foot every morning. This wrap gives max. support and yet very thin. The material is good quality. It isn't heavy or irritating. I like the 3 "" as I use less wrap. I also prefer the tan color. Good value. Can't touch this price at any big box store."
5,Nice product,"Had a very serious open would on my shin, and doctor recommended that I keep a bandage on it, and being allergic to most band-aids and tapes, this wrap was extremely beneficial for keeping the bandage in place - and it was bandaged for 6 mos. and never had this tape fail to do its job. Also can be used to wrap a lure coursing dogs legs and it stays put when you put it on - even after running."
4,good but not great,"A good book when dealing with project or company valuation. However, I feel many of the subjects are not dealt with enough detail. All in all, it is more than enough for a general knowledge on valuation."
5,Excellent,This was the first time i purchased a book online. Transaction was simple and services were prompt.
5,The bible on valuation,still the best practical guide out there - latest edition has some very interesting updates
2,Valuation Review,"The delivery took three times as long as Amazon promised and the book was damaged when I recieved it. Also, it was missing content (i.e. End of chapter questions.)"
3,"comprehensive, academic","I work for one of the largest banks in the US, and we use this book as a reference when we need to dig into the more arcane details of a project. If you do a lot of valuation work, this is a recommended text, but it is tome-like and a bit laborious to use, and I've found much of the advice it contains is rather ivory tower and not-so-practical in real world situations. If you are studying valuation theory, or do a lot of this work, particularly on publicly-held companies, you'll definitely want this textbook, though over time it might not be the one you reach for everyday. To accompany it, I would suggest also buying Horn's ""Unlocking the Value of a Business"" for everyday use, which is a more concise and user-friendly manual on privately-held company valuation, with a more lighthearted, less-academic tone, and Horn's credentials as an acquisitions dealmaker yield advice that is decidedly more practical."
3,"Not bad, not great","my unit was refurbished and didn't work too well; it's an impressive device, but in the end I went with the Sony 610N; the LCD screen is a bit cumbersome and the device itself it a little too large to use other than planting it on the coffee table or such..."
1,Not what was expected,The Motorola Q cradle did not fit my Motorola Q. Not what was expected. I had to return Item and pay for return postage. Definately would not buy this Item.
3,This product was returned because it only allows you to charge your phone from a PC.,I was under the impression that this product was for 2 different power sources like the cradle charger I have for my wife's Palm Treo. It only allows you to charge from a USB souce. It also wouldn't hold my phone with the extended battery.
2,Disapointing,"I found this book have a very old viewpoint on managing requirements. Especially for peoples who adopt OO analysis & design. The author separate strongly the data (with entity diagrams) and processing, using DFD which were left between OMT and UML. This book doesn't give me more or different value than Suzanne Robertson's book. The only exception is the 2 chapters on FPA evaluation that I found very clear and good."
1,Mega Memory is a Mega Fraud,I remember watching Kevin Trudeau pitching these Mega Memory audio cassette tapes on the Danny Bonaduce show back in the early 1990's. Trudeau gets these down-on-their luck B-list celebrities to help him sell this worthless garbage on an unsuspecting public. It does not work as advertised because it is physically impossible for it to work as advertised. My dad bought them back when Kevin was pitching this on his infomercials and when I was recently cleaning out my house I found it amongst the stuff in the basement collection dust. This definitely went into the trash can during my Spring cleaning.Anyone who has watched the John Stossel 20/20 special on Kevin Trudeau and his constant run-ins with the federal government over his unsavory and fraudulent business practices knows full well to stay away from anything associated with the Trudeau name.
4,"Enjoyable, quick read","The touching prolog tells of the ""ghost pains"" suffered by a grandfather who lost a limb in the Civil War. Lily can't understand how he can claim to feel pain in his missing leg until she undergoes a loss of her own. Her older sister dies, but readers won't know that's going to happen until the end. The sibling rivalry described is right on target. This is a wonderful story for girls who enjoy sentimental, fast-paced fiction. Don't be turned off by the critics...sure the book tinges on melodramatic, but fourth, fifth and sixth grade girls (and this librarian) love the book! It will make you appreciate family and offers lots of opportunities for discussion."
3,A touching and encouraging account,"Although the amount of personal detail in this account may be somewhat daunting for readers who are not themselves familiar with Mr. Johnson, his is a touching story of faith and an encouraging tale of accomplishments in the face of difficulties. People who feel that circumstances are conspiring against them will take heart from the perspective of a man who pressed on in spite of his trials."
4,A concise account of the great patriotic war,"Dr. Overys book is a well written analytical as well as narrative of what the Russians referrers to as the `Great Patriotic War'. Especially interesting is the debunking of some old myths upheld by the Soviet leadership after the war regarding the amount and thus effect of western aid. In addition, the use of released and downgraded documents as to the darker side of the battles and how close the Russians came to loose the war. All in all, a very interesting and analytical book, however in the later part it is as if the author is running slightly out of time, something which earns the book four rather than five stars. Still a first rate and concise account of the `Great Patriotic war'."
4,"Readable, interesting treatment with new insights.","This is an easier read than many books on this complex and much-discussed topic. The question addressed is: how did Russia do it? How did they go from complete surprise in June '41 (a myth the author debunks) to absolute victory over the Germans in WWII? Mr. Overy helps us amateurs along by explaining the meaning of the new material and insights. He tells what we thought we knew, and what we now know--making an old topic into an interesting detective story. Overy's treatment of Stalin appears to be a little too sympathetic for my tastes, but he puts his case forward in an unemotional fashion. I haven't seen the TV series that accompanied the text, but I'm tempted to visit the video store."
5,More 'meat' to how unprepared the Russians were at the outset but also how the Russian people recovered.,"This particular book gives more 'meat' into how the Russian people were able to recover from massive early defeats, thru their own dedication for their country, and at least temporarily escape their dictatorship only to eventually fall to it."
3,Spotty History,"This is not a bad history of Russia and Germany in WWII, but it does leave some holes. For instance, there is very little mention of the crucial factor of the weather in the war (favoring the Soviet Army). Also, the stories of the major battles are strung together like pearls, and the reader is left with the impression that the entire war consisted of only a few major battles. Still, I highly recommend this book for readers who want a single book focusing on the subject."
5,Loved it!,This was a fresh look at a small sampling of current Americana! Thoroughly enjoyed the perspective. Drawings were fresh and creative!
4,Mobil Travel Guide 2000 - Northeast,"I highly recommend this guide to anyone who will be traveling in the Northeast as well as Canada. This guide gives you everything from upcoming events for the year to where to stay & eat. The maps are easy to read and follow. I have been a reader of the Mobil Guide for many years and it is continuing to give the most accurate, up-to-date travel information. This is the MUST-HAVE for the Northeast traveler."
3,"catchy, but still a musical rip-off","""Let Forever Be"" is a catchy rip-off of the Beatles' ""Tomorrow Never Knows,"" While some may question why such an obvious tribute to John Lennon's acid-trip garners such criticism, I feel that the Chemical Brothers, like any musical talent, should have done a bit more than lift an entire riff from a classic album. After all, poor George Harrison got nailed for making ""My Sweet Lord"" a tad too close to ""He's So Fine."" At best it's in the wannabe vein, at worst it's simply not doing your homework. Please."
4,"Please tell me, Ernest Allen.","I found this comment at Amazon.fr:la version réseau pose des problèmes avec des postes XP Pro. Je n'ai pour l'instant pas pu trouver l'origine du problème et ne sais donc pas si le problème (le dico ne s'ouvre pas) est un problème du dictionnaire ou de WinXPPro. car cela fonctionnait plutt bien avec Win2000 Pro.[...]The CD of Petit Robert we can buy here at Amazon.com is tuned to Windows XP (pro ou home edition)? In a word, is it a newer edition of the French version above?-------------Very recently at the review page of a web bookstore in France I knew this software demands the CD again put into the drive for each 100 time use. If it is the case, I cannot say that it is always comfortable to use."
2,Not My Kind of Music.... Sorry.,"I am trying, trying to feel this kind of a cappella music but I simply can't. It kind-of reminds me of music for elevators. Something stuck in the 1960's that starts to wear down on me by the 2nd song. It's just not the kind of music I can wrap my heart around. I guess I like more classical / orchestral / choral instead of this style. It actually makes me anxious to change the iPod or simply turn it off. I feel like I'm being forced to sit in a church that I don't attend."
1,"Poor Compilation, Only For Die-Hard Fans","Frank Sinatra recorded many holiday favorites over the years, many of them before the age of stereophonic sound. Unfortunately, that's what you get in this collection. Perhaps 60% of the songs on this CD are of good quality; perhaps six of the songs are actually muffled recordings of radio broadcasts. Two of the songs actually sound like they were lifted directly off of old 78 rpm records, complete with annoying background hiss. Buy this CD only if you really want to hear some older versions of Sinatra's Christmas songs. If you are looking for quality sound, I'd check for one of the collections from one of the major record labels."
1,"Shoddy labor, bad recordings","This compillation (probably made of radio and TV discards) is to be generally avoided. Boasting with Bing Crosby on few songs is silly, for on many songs lead voices are lost in the choir and bad sound quality...Some of the tracks capture at least a part of Frank's magic but is it enough to give more than one star to this?No way."
3,The size is smaller,"I have other products so these are as I expected. These products are heavy glass, not dainty. Not much detail but the glasses is sturdy. Stand up to everyday use well. The size is smaller than most of the average use goblets."
5,Love the look,These glasses are just what I was looking for. I have used them for Thanksgiving and Christmas this year already and they go well with everything. I love the glass pitcher as well. Perfect size and I prob. would not have bought it if it didnt come with the pitcher.Thanks!
5,"I knew where to go, clockwise or not,and at what time!Great!","Without this book to help a first time visitor, I would have stood in the middle of Mainstreet, USA, Magic Kingdom not knowing what to do or where to go. I felt, after reading this book, that I was an expert Disney tourist. I recommend everyone traveling to DisneyWorld to read this book and become an expert in FANTASY!!!"
2,Nice sound quality but...,The sound quality on these headphones is pretty good in highs and lows. The bass isn't the greatest but when I bought my headphones they were about $60 on sale so it was about what I expected for the price.About 7 months after I bought it the plastic holding the right cup broke after I had accidentally stepped on them. I fixed the plastic but soon after the left cup busted off without warning. There were no cracks in the plastic or anything indicating it was close to breaking. Unfortunately Sony's warranty is only 90 days so the only option is to fix them on your own.
2,sound good but fell apart,these are good headphones the sound is good and the bass in them sounds good too. But after about a week or so of having them the ear piece broke off! also the padding around the ears is starting to peel off
2,Dont get these,These headphones have very nice sound to them but after listening to them for about 15 minutes your ears start to hurt.
1,well the mdr-v300 is better than this mdr-v500,i was shock how sucky this thing was i thought it was gonna be head banging but it low and the only good thing about these is that i use them for recording my music but as far as listening to music with this thing is a big no no! i'ma have to say that the mdr-v300 is better than these
3,Very quiet,"I bought one of these and one of the 300 model to test and compare. Although these were the more expensive model, and sounded better, volume was very low. The 300 was able to reproduce sound much louder despite the settings on any volume controls.However, if you're a moderate-level user, and you're looking for supurb sound quality, it's here."
2,Should have read the reviews..,"Thinking back, I always read reviews on products I'm going to spend more than (...) on, and for some reason I didn't do that this time.. I sure wish I had. The quality of sound is only thing about these headphones that are good, probably great. The feel of the headphones are just atrocious. On top of being very uncomfortable, they make a god awful noise when you move your jaw in the slightest. Drinking, eating, chewing gum, moving your head side to side, anything that makes the headphones move in the slightest, you hear the sound of two pieces of plastic rubbing together. I've owned many headphones, from (...), and I've never had this problem. Even if you take that problem away, the headphones are very heavy and tight on your head. As long as you don't wear them for more than 20 minutes you should be fine, though you'll still be putting up with the plastic noise. I gave it two stars for the quality of the sound."
2,Painful and expensive,"I can't give a long-term review because I couldn't spend more than 30 minutes with these headphones on as they are small and tight, giving me a headache. The sound quality is not that great for the price. One plus is that it blocks outside noise a little better than the more expensive ""official"" noise-blocking headphones. Still, when you see something labeled as DJ headphones you expect something that would feel comfortable and stand up to abuse for hours.Bottom line, the construction quality is poor and they're painful to use."
3,"Sound is OK, uncomfortable to wear","The sound is fine enough (maybe a little lacking in substance) and it seals off any outer noise very well. However, my biggest complaint is that I can't really wear them for more than an hour at a time. They pinch quite tightly around my ears and if I'm wearing glasses as well, it's downright uncomfortable. I'd say they were the opposite of cushy. In hindsight, I should have spent a little more and gotten a pair of headphones with the double headband."
4,"Decent headphones, dont forget their power requirments","I bought these headphones because I wanted fuller base and sturdy portable design. The MDR-V500DJ is definitely built well, but when you use them with a notebook or cd player or mp3 player they sound cheap and thin. The cd players and all just don't have enough power to push those 40 mm drivers. These headphones have an impedance of 40 ohms making them useless unless you have a preamp in your sound card, an external preamp or a good size home theater amp. The non-professional headphones that will work with your smaller devices have an impedance of around 20ohms or so. I would recommend Panasonic RP HT355 Ear-cup Headphones. They don't fold, but they sure do give a lot fuller bass response and cost about half as much."
4,great quality build,"great sound sound quality and looks awesome, can be a little bit uncomfortable but you get used to it and the cord is kind of long for use with an mp3 player but its ultimately a good pair for the price your paying"
4,"Good quality, high price","The sound quality isn't that great, but everything else is! Got these for $12 at a garage sale and totally worth it."
3,Acceptable but not impress,"Being brand SONY I would see them going for more months or years working but the earcup is kind of average size but rather wish a bigger size for greater sound, the highs are normal not crystal clear, the bass is punchy but is there, the construction is good with many features adjustment, swivel, comfort, cable... I paid like $50.00. If you want to DJ prefer to get one pair of great expensive headphones they are crucial for mixing. I already wasted money on berinhger cheap $25 and they sound crappy plus are broken now, then upgraded it to this SONY which is good, but with a little more I could probably get better."
4,O.K.,these headphones are alright. they are well made. I had a pair of stanton Dj pro 3000's with better drivers but their cunstruction sucks they broke at the adustment band. These phones are not as capable of producing the same sound but they are built better therefore I recomend them.
2,Too fragile,My pair broke just after one year... I will never buy sony products again... they are just not good quality.
3,Average Headphones,"Average at best, if you are using for djing, you might want to consider another headphone unless the mixer have a pre-amp. I am having to put both left and right sides of headphone on to hear the cue track. Hope that helps."
4,"Good sound, Cheap plastic","These have much better sound than Sony's $50 headphones.However, like all Sony headphones, the cheap plastic ear-bud holders broke after a year or so. I've superglued them back on at least 3 times in the 2.5 years I've had them. Finally today the cord has worn down so much sound only comes through the left ear, so I'm buying another pair."
3,eh,not the most comfortable or luxurious headphone I've ever put on my head. though they are pretty cheap. the way they are described is a bit misleading.not very loud compared to other dj headphones I've used. i am not sure that they would even be suitable for a live dj venue. they are pretty decent for the price pointand the threaded gold connectors are a nice feature i wouldn't recommend them though. spend a little more money. get what you really need
4,Decent phones for a good price,"As a known, touring DJ I depend on my headphones. I'd been using the Sony MDJ-V700DJ's because they sounded great and let's face it, looked impressive on stage and in photos. But they get flimsy after a while and they're supposed to be heavy-duty. I've gone through 3 pair in the past 6 years at over $150 a pop (more if you buy actual retail like at Guitar Center!), and no, I don't abuse them! The last pair I had snapped onstage at the Movement festival in Detroit, so I borrowed a fellow DJs headphones to finish the show. I figured I wouldn't spend so much on headphones the next time, so I ordered the V500DJ headphones. Lighter than the V700DJs, and work great. I use them in the studio as well, and not too heavy or hot around the ears for casual iPod use.Ironically, I see that the V700s have now come down in price! But I'll stick with these for awhile."
4,Cormyr - A Successful Novel,"I can't say I've been a huge fan of Ed Greenwood's books to date (too much action, not enougth character development), but in being teamed with Jeff Grubb, something interesting has happenned, an excellent book has been created.The concept of swapping between a historically driven and current events chapters really worked well for me.Both parts of the book worked great together, the historical elements easily the best part of the book. If you've an interest in the Forgotten Realms books, this one is well worth your time. If you don't, then I doubt you'd get a great deal of joy from this title."
2,AN AVERAGE BOOK,The book has a lot of interesting historical material about cormyr...But it is bad written ...And some parts of it are BORING and tiring....
5,This is a very good book!!,"This book is a very good book as I've written above. It starts out with the old dragon killing buffalo. Ed Greenwood and Jeff Grubb should team up to write a book again sometime. They sure do add a lot of detail when they write. The book sure does get confusing the way it skips around from year to year. But it's still a very very good book. I'mm going to buy the sequel sometime in the future. This book is not as good as some of Ed's ""Elminster"" books. Those books wipe this book out but agin this was a really good book. Like all other books Ed has worked on this one is pretty violent but I personally like it that way. You may disagree with some of my opinions but again they are only MY opinions."
2,Informative But Dull,The story is tired and predictable. Read this book only if you really want to know the history of Cormyr.
2,Just another interview disc.,"This disc is not an offical release by Queen, EMI, or Hollywood, and contains no music."
3,Got what I paid for.,"Keep in mind; it's not an expensive sword. You don't get to check it out before you buy it. That said, for the price I was quite pleased. The blade isn't really very sharp, it's a bit wobbly in the handle, and I wasn't ecstatic with the construction of the scabbard, but overall, I think it'll be a good piece to train with. I imagine it'll do some damage if you swing it at someone (probably to the sword as well as them). From other reviews, it looks like the wobbly-factor isn't constant, and may sometimes come sharp. In fact, it may be possible to sharpen it; there is an edge, but it's not so hot. I haven't tried, myself, but it may be possible.All said, it's a good sword for the price, but if you want something really nice, you may want to hold out for one you get to check yourself, and be prepared to pay more."
4,Lovely and strong,"This trilogy is satisfying and surprising in the strength of its female characters while never losing sight of a good story. Fantasy at its finest...you get parallel worlds, magic, mundanity, and misunderstanding, but not to comic effect, rather to catastrophic endings.What is really lovely about reading this series, other than the fine prose, is the ambivalence that each character encounters and doesn't quite overcome...in other words, it is a fine telling of the difficulties that we all have in the negotiation of adolescence to adulthood. This series is never condescending and truly pays attention to the intelligence that all of us carry."
5,Kay,I am absolutely happy about my purchase. The books arrived earlier than the given estimated delivery time and the boxed set is awesome. The books look brand-new and the little box in which they come is an added bonus. Great steal and good price.
2,Here's a different take,"I found the first book, Sabriel, readable, if not fantastic. The second book, Lirael, is really quite awful, and I only made it 100 pages or so. The writing is poor....blocky sentences and remedial storyline. Anyways, the love fest for this trilogy needed some perspective."
4,"Interesting, to say the least.","I bought this book so that I wouldn't look like an idiot during my first trip to New York City. Well, I'm sure I will still look like an idiot, but maybe not like this is my first vacation there. After reading this book, I feel that there is no way that I can only stay 4 days. There's too much to do! I appreciate that he writes of as many cheap places as expensive. I am a map nerd so I do miss that aspect."
2,Tiresome,"Beware this guide: it is riddled with misinformation (directing one, for example, to the shuttered Bettmann Archive) and other errors of fact and interpretation. It is good on architecture and theater, terrible on literary New York. I couldn't figure who the target audience was--tourists? the newly resettled? --but much of the information is easily available elsewhere, and the 'attitude' is highly tiresome."
5,nice glasses,"I bought these for a woman from Morocco, she said they are not like the glasses from there. Other than the misnomer, they are nice glasses."
3,Moroccan Tea Glasses Red Tunis,"The glasses are much smaller than expected. However, the receiver of the gift is using them for small votive candles."
4,Not for Purists,"This fanciful retelling mixes modern fantasy into an old classic. Arthurian purists will be displeased, but younger readers will be greatly amused by the tales' vivid descriptions, interesting psychological elements, and brief bits of high-brow coating to low-brow humor. A wonderful read."
5,Excellent read,"Fans of the Arthurian cycle looking for a thought provoking, engaging story will love Mad Merlin. The variations King presents are unexpected, and entirely unique. Well written and fast paced, you won't want to put this one down. Save this for your day off, or plan to call in sick."
4,Took awhile but finally got there...and I enjoyed it.,This book took awhile to get past the normal arthur legend and moved on finally to an interesting twist. I will say I did enjoy the tale in full...but you must read the entire book to realize the writers plan for the story. I would recommend this for a nice change.
5,A Superb Addition to the Arthurian Bookshelf,"As a voracious fantasy reader and writer, I read a LOT of Arthurian fiction, from the very-well-known (Mary Stewart, MZB) to the far less so (Turner's King of the Lordless Country), and this new offering from Rob King is among the best. Full disclosure time: Rob and I are friends and co-workers, having collaborated on novels and edited each other. However, that doesn't influence me in saying that I bought it sight unseen, took it home to glance at it, ended up reading it through at one sitting, and want more. In particular, Excalibur is handled brilliantly. Rob also conveys the feel of impending doom and bloodshed as well as any writer I've ever read, not just the clangour and shouting of actual battle. I look forward to sequels, if any. Buy it, read it, and see if you don't agree. This is both a keeper and one to give as a gift to friends!!!"
5,brilliant!,"I've been using Zome Tools at home with my kids for seven years now. We discovered them at a gifted conference and my son begged me to buy him a set! Zome is fun and versatile. This Creator 1 kit is big enough to use for many different designs. The handy storage box fits everything in a well organized manner, so you can find the pieces you need easily. Zome is fun for kids from about age 6-7 up to adults. The youngest may have some small trouble with connecting the rods and spheres, but it really isn't too tough. The thing that sets Zome apart from other building tools is that you can connect pieces at many different angles. Zome is used in science and math classes to model all sorts of things- snowflakes, DNA strands, dodecahedrons, etc. This is a GREAT product!"
5,Great toy!!!,"My son has built many things and loves this toy. We will be purchasing lots more, this also helped him be creative and less likely to want to get on the computer or watch tv."
1,NOT A GOOD DEAL,"First, the printer is a very good printer and has great clarity, saturation, and overall photo quality. So, what's the problem? The problem is that you can't get the ribbon (ANYWHERE!) without buying all the paper w/it. AND I've bought at least 5 ""pkgs"" of ribbon/paper (only way you can buy it) and I have a TON of paper left over. It does not print correct amount of prints to ribbon. Also, I would not recommend this item because you cannot buy the ribbon/toner easily. It's very expensive and must always be ordered online. I've never seen it in a store anywhere. Sorry, Samsung. THere are many great quality photo printers out there that have easy access to accessories -- such as BASIC toner to run the thing!"
5,Samsung Photo Printer / Paper,"Having used inkjets of all makes, this Dye Sublimation Printer and paper combination is too great. The photo quality is excellent, the easy of use is too simple, and the picture life is unbelievable.I also was most impressed with how quickly I was able to get the product with standard, free shipping. I received my order in 2 days! Well done."
3,"""Jersey in the House""","Im trying to figure out where the accents are from. Boston, Brooklyn or Italy ha Anyways the movie is about 2 girls who are on a rampage taking out every man they know that has done them wrong in the past. Not a bad movie, could be better in some areas, but not bad, its worth watching atleast once. A tip: if you date a girl from Boston, dont cheat on her!"
1,Not worth your time!,I have to say this is one of the worst movies made. Doesn't even hold a candle to anything of it's kind! Better luck next time!
1,So Disappointing,not up to pare at all!!! It said itwas in very good condition and it was not. It had huge holes in the middle of many pages
3,Disappointed,"It can't handle too much. If i fill it with onions, only the lower ones get chopped. So i have to fill in only half way or a little less. The chopping in itself is good."
2,Very hard to open the lead,"It chops very well, but when I try to remove the lead, it is really hard. I have to really muscle with it to take the lead off."
1,"Self proclaimed ""expert""- HA!","As with all of Mr. Veleanu's books, ""Jade: 5000 B.C. to 1912 A.D."" is, quite frankly, a pile of rubbish. The author clearly knows nothing about jade, and most of the jade in his book is from his own collection of fake jade. What a waste of money! I definitely do not recommend any of his books- you will be sorry.RECENT NEWS:Veleanu, a seller of ""archaic"" jade on eBay and GoAntiques has been sued after selling thousands of dollars worth of jade to a woman who recently discovered them to be fake! Amazon should dispose of this ridiculous publication!"
2,Mr Veleanu on Jade,"Mr Veleanu's book on Jade and, indeed, the author himself have come in for a good deal of criticism on the grounds that the book is not a learned treatise on jade and the author is of doubtful background and character. This may be true. I have no idea. But people need to turn the coin over and recognise that if the book is lacking in scholarly merit then it still may be used as a reference point as what not to buy when it comes to jade.Any serious collector of jade knows that the price paid for pieces of jade that carry impeccable authentication do not sell for a few hundred dollars but go for many thousands.I acknowledge Mr Veleanu's effort in putting the book together and showing us all what not to buy, if the learned critics are correct about the book and the author."
3,It adds different flava/spin to the Old hits...,"Es bueno escuchar la musica de Johnny Pacheco pero ellos cambiaron muchas de las canciones/charranga a salsa y no sono' igual que las originales,si quieren algo bueno de el compre la otras versiones de sus exitos...pero si ya los tienes como yo it adds a little flava/spin on the originals."
4,Tire chains,The chains I bought work great and made a huge improvement on my snowblowing abilities. The only yhing that could make them better would be the install instructions. Other than that they were great.
5,Great Purchase,Clear and easy to understand book! Get a copy of it if you have been struggling to incorporate technology in meaningful ways in your curriculum. You will be happy you did.
5,Very different from their other songs!!,"...I like prodigy but I have always known them to be mostly fast hard beats and this song is also, but this song has a gay/girly disco funk overtone which is suprising to see from prodigy..which is why I love the song even more..."
5,"Tense, contemplative, superbly crafted reading","The 9th Man is a compelling mystery novel of the Dick Hardesty series. Hardesty is a homosexual private investigator trying to earn a living in a trade that's rough on all genders and all sexual orientations. Hardesty is hired to find a murderer; as the body count rises, he realizes he's on the trail of a serial killer who is apparently being ignored by the police because all of the victims are gay. Enthusiastically recommended for all mystery fans, The 9th Man is a tense, contemplative, superbly crafted reading."
4,"Man Of 1,000 Voices","There are no words that simply describe the greatness of the late Mel Blanc. Over a decade after his passing, his voice still is the staple behind many of the characters of MGM, Hanna Barbera and Warner Brothers cartoons.A Salute To Mel Blanc was released in 1985, as part of Warner Brothers Golden Jubilee 24 Karat Collection. The cartoons stretch out all the kinks of any character like Daffy Duck, Bugs Bunny, or even Taz. Considering that some of these cartoons on the collection are very difficult to find in their original format, like Robin Hood Daffy, Rabbit Of Seville, and Little Boy Boo with Foghorn Leghorn.Although Mel Blanc passed away in 1989, his voice is still the staple of Warner Brothers cartoons today. Many cartoons today might be a little zanier than the past, but there is no doubt about Mel Blanc, The Man Of 1,000 Voices. That's All Folks."
5,EXCELLENT WARNER BROS. CARTOON COLLECTION,"Full title is: WARNER BROS. CARTOONS GOLDEN JUBILEE 24 KARAT COLLECTION - A TRIBUTE TO MEL BLANCEach cartoon features a different WB director, so it makes for an excellent sampling of styles & characters. The great titles included are ""Robin Hood Daffy,""(Daffy & Porky) ""Bedevilled Rabbit,""(Bugs & Tasmanian Devil) ""Bad Ol' Puddy Tat,""(Tweety & Sylvester) ""Ballot Box Bunny,""(Bugs w. Yosemite Sam) ""Past Performance,"" ""Little Boy Boo,"" ""Who's Kitten Who,"" and ""The Rabbit of Seville.""(Bugs & Elmer) 58 minutes. Highly recommended!!!"
2,intriguing plot but ...,"If you care whether filthy language and explicit sex scenes are in the novels you buy, save your money and skip this one. The plot was intriguing, but couldn't get through it."
5,Love this movie!!,"If you love cheesy teen movies as much as I do then you will love this feel good movie as much as I do. Sure it is a little dumb, but it is adorable. I love it!"
4,Not bad for a Disney flick,"I got this movie for my teen sister. We watched it together and I actually thought it was pretty cute. A little bit predictable, not the best acting, but overall, a sweet preteen/teenager story."
3,Good romactic movie,Love this movie: has a good story : romactic :funny u have to love itAwesome movieBuy this movie
4,The Irish Banana Review,"It's cute. It's sweet ... It's nothing you wouldn't expect from a Disney teen movie.For the most part the acting is good (anyone who has seen Aimee Teegarden in Friday Night Lights knows this girl can act). The plot is saccharine, predictable, and overly wrought with teenage emotion. If you have a problem with those things, then you probably shouldn't be watching a teen-geared movie called ""PROM.""Take it for what it is - a feel-good, often time cheesy, movie about teens on the cusp of adulthood where life always works out."
5,good,I got this movie for my fourteen year old niece for Christmas. I have not seen the movie but she seemed very excited when she opened it.
4,It was better than expected,"Prom was a lot better than I expected. It followed more than one storyline which I enjoyed. I'm a sucker for teen drama which can be awful at times in the movies, but I would probaly buy it at some point."
5,"Wonderful Relaxing DVD, but also a Workout!","I highly recommend this DVD. It's very relaxing, but it's a great workout as well! I love the routine. Brenda is an amazing instructor. She explains every detail and is really very calm, nice and encouraging. She is a lovely person to have in your living room :-)This DVD may be a bit difficult for beginners with short hamstrings, but it's not a problem to bend your knees!You need just a yoga mat. No other equipment which is great."
5,Another great album...,"I have been a huge Tahiti 80 since their first album. I heard ""Heartbeat"" and was instantly hooked. I then got the subsequent second album, ""Wallpaper for the Soul"" (their masterpiece"" and now ""A Pice of Sunshine"". These guys make gorgeous, smooth hook-laden pop music of the highest order. The songs are not lyrically or musically complex, but they are catchy as hell and very fun to listen to. This album is complex, because it has a few duds on it but it also contains some of the best songs they have ever recorded, and it is in these songs that you hear the maturity and progression these guys will definitely show on their next full-length. Luckily this EP is 10 songs so it should hold us over until that next album is released."
5,Great EP,I don't like the dance music this group plays--too Euro-disco--but this is great R&B-inflected pop with wonderful vocals.
4,Southern Scrumptious,"Beautifully and inticingly written. Recipes are clearly divided into sections, brunch, cocktails, etc. Worth the time and cost."
3,Decent radiator hose,"It is different from the original on my VW Jetta 96. The extention hose that goes to the oil filter was a little too long. I had to cut it a little to fit. Better be too long than too short.Somehow, the engineering work from the one who fabricated this this radiator hose is very good. I do not know if the quality will let me blame the product in a near future but it does what it's supposed to do and worth the price."
3,LUNCH MONEY,"This was required reading for incoming 6th grader. He did not like the book but other classmates did..Purchased used, was in good condition."
4,9 yr old's review,"""A good book"" - 3rd grader reviews..""Greg Kenton liked money and he was good at making it. One day while selling comics, one of his money making schemes, he finds a comic by his arch enemy Maura Shaw in his comic stack. He finds her and confronts her. This thrilling tale is the story of two enemies who join together to make things fair in the school after they are banned from selling comics."""
5,money book,it tells you how greg makes his moneyhe gets it by sellinghe sold comics toys and he sold candy
5,Katie's Review,"I liked this book because the two kids, Greg and Maura, stick up for what they believe is right .In this story Greg and Maura make these two comic books and sell them at school, but the principal finds out and they're not allowed to sell them at school. Maura sees that the principal lets books and comic books be sold at school from the book club and shows Greg. They find out that there's a school board meeting on Thursday so they go to it and talk about their comics. Does the school board let them sell the comics? Read the book to find out.I would recommend this story to someone who wants to sell something at school. I would also recommend it to people that are any age because it's an awesome book."
5,An Enjoyable Read,"I just finished reading Lunch Money. I am a fourth grade teacher. Within our reading program, we teach a unit on business and making money. This book will fit in perfectly. It's a great example of what it takes to get even a simple business off the ground. I was impressed with how Mr. Clements had the two main characters plead their case to convince the grown ups in charge that they be aloud to continue their business. The book is humorous and allows the reader the opportunity to understand the twists and turns of taking a seemingly simple idea and turning it into a money-making venture.Mr. Clements appears to have an amazing grasp of the mind of a middle school child. The characters and the dialogue were very believable. I enjoyed reading Lunch Money. I can't wait to share it with my class. I know they will enjoy it too."
5,Lunch Money,"I really liked LUnch Money because it was detailed, funny and lots more!It is about a boy named Greg, who, really, really, really likes money. For almost his whole life he has been enemies with a girl named Maura.What will happen?Read the book to find out!"
5,Well Written,"I thought that the whole stroy was very funny. Also, i loved the characters and how they interacted with each other. The plot was good and the climax was astonishing."
3,I have seen better,I used this book as well as the exam cram series to take and pass both the SCSA 1 and 2 tests this book is good but there is at least a 10% error rate in the exam sim questions and quite a bit of information that is not required to pass either of the exams.
4,"Good start, but don't use it as sole source","The Sygress study guide for the Sun Solaris 8 certification exam is well written and covers all of the published objectives in an organized manner. However, there is material on the exam that is not covered in this book. If you are taking the exam, use this book as one of your study materials, but certainly do not rely on only on it to pass the exam."
2,Did not Help me in the Exam,"I just completed Part1 and nothing, i mean nothing helped me from this book. I did pass with 75% but i now have to look for other books for part2"
4,The Good & The Bad,"When I look for a study guide, I usually aim for a book that is deep enough to come in handy after the exam. I have not taken the test yet but after reading the chapters it is obvious the focus is to teach the bare minimum to pass. I suppose this could be considered a good thing. I just bought a used sparc10 to play with and let me tell you, this book has not been very helpful. I would like to mention that an earlier reviewer has made a few mistakes in pointing out parts left in/out of this book. This text does include information about RBAC, and has dropped SAF(SAC) as it should. IPv6 is not an objective for the SCSA. In conclusion,.. This looks like a good study guide, but you will probably want to supplement it with another book or web docs."
2,Solaris 8 not a good guide,"This book ,although it follows the Sun Solaris Study guide is not very helpful in real terms , also the test on the cd-ROM is less than helpful if you think it is going to give you a feel for the real exam forget it. The type of questions asked are not searching enough to make one think hard enough. My advice to anyone thinking of taking the exam is to stick to an official Sun Microsystem training manual and learn everything , literally. The exam is not at all difficult just tricky in part , and so if you knew the subject well enough you will pass."
3,101 Indoor Activities for Toddlers and Preschoolers: Triplet Tested,"I liked the book overall,but felt it wasn't worth the money since it came to me pretty damaged."
2,Not appropriate for table top use.,The gain on this mic is horrible. I was hoping to use four of them as desktop mic's for a conference we have coming up. Unless your directly on top of this mic it picks up less than my $5 dollar Nady condenser mic.
2,"quality okay, but annoying white noise",the mic's quality is okay but i tried using it with my iriver mp3-player and my computer and i get that really annoying white noise in the background all the time (it's really loud). before you buy it check out some sample-recordings on the internet if you are interested in high quality.
5,Great sound recording for the pric e,You can't beat the sound quality for the price. I've used this mic for recording v.o. for film and also lyric tracks for music. For the money you can't beat the quailty
4,'digital'? really?,"I've been more than satisfied with this microphone and had some pretty surprising results using it. Have to quibble though with the word 'digital' in the description. Yeah, you can use it with digital devices by plugging it into the ANALOG input. There is nothing digital about this microphone and that's just fine with me. Trying to sell something by calling it 'digital' is so nineties: they could get the hipsters' attention by calling it 'analog' instead... and they'd be telling the truth."
5,Simple setup - excellent price point for recordings,I use the MS-MS907 microphone on a weekly basis. My main use of this microphone is to record lectures and it does a good job of it. Of course microphone placement is the key to a good recording but the MS907 provides a good pickup at this price point. It operates on a single AA battery and is highly efficient with energy consumption. Another feature I like about this microphone is that it provides two pickup pattern (90degrees for an individual speaker and 120degrees to accomodate a chorus).I would recommend investing in either a minidisc recorder or a MP3 recorder.
3,Sounds ok...,"This works well with a sony digital camcorder, and it is the same product as a similar looking mic marketed for camcorders specifically. This works poorly with a computer mic input. I Compared a cheap (cheaper than this mic) XLR vocal mic with this sony one. I connected both to a USB audio interface (mbox 2/protools le) and the vocal mic outperforms the sony mic by a significantly noticeable degree for instrumental recording. If you're not using this with a minidisc recorder, spring for a usb/firewire AD converter interface for a computer with an xlr mic instead of a minidisc with this mic."
2,"terrible fidelity, sensitivity","bought this to use with my minidisc recorder from like 8 years ago. Anyway, it was not a good mike, low quality and way over priced. Just buy a shure SM57/SM58 and 1/4 to 1/8 adapter."
4,nice but,This is a nice little mic but I am not sure a regular mic would be even better.I am happy with the mic though.
4,Good remote for this price,"Nice things:1)Works with my Old Sony Trinitron TV, SharpVCR, and Aiwa mini bookself audio system.2) Not too much bottons,effective design for the usage of the button. I like the remote that the number (0-9) is on the top part since I do not use them so often. However, you may have to really read the manual and learn about how to use those shift keys.3) Fast signal, you do not have to point direct the remote to the device to use it.4) Use 2 AA batteries, so the remote is not too heavy (Radio Shack's use 4 AAAs)5)The extra LCD screen is only help you to know which device you are controlling, most of the other remotes do not have this.6)Menu & Recall & Sleep & favorite (memory) buttonsThings I don't like:1)Unforfortable shape to hold2)Bad design of user manual, a big piece of folding paper, inconvience to store and fold it out."
1,Not very good,"I recently bought a Sony Home Theater and decided to buy this remote specifically since had all the labeled buttons for my Home Theater (STR-DE 485). Guess what, it doesn't work (even verified that with Sony). It also doesn't control my RCA 5 CD changer, or my JVC DVD. It only works with my TV and VCR. I wouldn't waste my time on this one."
2,Sony remote should work with Sony DVD players,"Purchased this remote figuring it would eliminate all my Sony remotes (receiver, dvd, cd, tv, etc) However, it doesn't have a dedicated DVD function button, and the AV1/AV2 buttons wouldn't work at all with the Sony DVD player. This is horrible, and makes a perfect universal remote a piece of junk. I love Sony products, but this one is a kicker.If you don't have a DVD player and don't plan on buying a Sony dvd player, then this remote is great. Easy to program, glow in the dark keys and backlit LCD display is nice. Size, weight, balance is very good.Couple more notes, did not work with my digital cable box, worked (barely) with my cd player. Gut feeling says this remote was designed/built before DVD players and digital cable box's were popular.Just my 2 cents."
4,Nice remote for basic features,"I'm in a lucky position of having a Sony TV, VCR, and Receiver. This remote works great for these components, as well as my Kenwood CD player. The base is a bigger than most remotes, which makes it much easier to reach the buttons (You don't need to scrunch your fingers to reach some of them). Contrary to what Sony's website says, this remote does not activate the menu for my Sony VCR, which is a big pain, since most of the functionality for the VCR lies in the menu. Although most of the keys are backlit, the 'Power' and the component selector switches aren't. In fact, the are black, which makes them impossible to distinguish in the dark."
2,"Looks great, but doesn't work with a lot of things","I have to confess, that i did get this remote for the looks, most are ugly and plain, but I ended up fidning that it didn't work with my cable box, which sort of defeats the purpose of me having one."
2,Doesn't work with Sony DVD or Sony Receiver,"I just bought a JVC TV, Sony VCR, Sony DVD Player, and Sony Receiver with Surround Speakers. I needed one remote control to rule them all so I reasoned since the majority of black boxes were SONY, I should buy the Sony Universal remote for best compatibility.To my Surprise, the remote worked with the JVC TV and Sony VCR but would not work the the Sony DVD or Sony Receiver. I think this is an older universal remote, cira 2000 and doesn't support the newer Sony IR protocols. Oh well, I am taking it back to Circuit City and continuing the quest for one remote to rule over all the devices."
3,Only OK,"For the most part the book was an enjoyable read, but I feel the characters and plot spun out of control to an unsatisfactory and incomplete ending."
5,Practically all you need for Kindergarten!,"I love this book, it is so worth the money!! The activities (which include Language Arts, Math, Science, Music, Art, Social Studies, games, and recommended reading book lists) are all arranged in alphabetical order. Each unit starts with a big black and white uppercase letter page to color (and learn), the next page is tracing practice of the uppercase and lowercase letter, then come all of the activity pages, about 12 pages of activities for each letter! You will NEVER run out of ideas and learning opportunities with this book! Take it from me, I've spent a load of money on several workbooks, flashcard sets, this that and the other, to use with my 4 year old little boy, but honestly this book is all we need, it covers everything! And the activities are really fun and enriching, not boring! Happy learning!"
5,Great resource!,This book is a great resource for any parent wanting to start the learning process before they enter kindergarten! The lessons are full of really fun ideas and they flow very well! Great Book!
5,fun ideas for kids,"perfect for the pre-school i am helping teach. TONS of creative ideas. if i had to pick a book all over again, it would be this one."
4,The Texas Rangers Military tranditions,This is an excellent book for anyone interested in the early years of the Texas Rangers when they were a para military force and the beginning of their transition to the modern law enforcement agency. McCulloch played a critical role in these events>
2,AN OLD STORY,"This issue is from way back in the early 90s and it shows !!!! A story about a young flag burning black man being protected by the vigilante punisher from a death squad is a good and noble one its just as some times in these storys the action suffers because the reader is being preached too !!!! the story by mike baron is solid enough and the art by neil hanson is ok its just compared too todays stories it suffers greatly,check it out if your one of the newer pun man fans!"
1,Not At All Wonderful,This has got to be one of the worst ideas of the 90's. What Kenny G and Arista have done to this song is a total mockery to the memory of one of the greatest musicians of all time. Thumbs down to all involved.
1,How does Kenny G sleep at night?,"When I heard this, my stomach turned. What a sacriledge to good music. The key difference between Kenny G and talented musicians is that the only time KG is even tolerable is at lousy work parties, brief elevator trips, and when undergoing dental surgery. This is nothing short of blasphemy: a no-talent clown defiling a work from one of America's legends. It's OK to be a cheesy musician, but not if you're going to insult a real musician who isn't alive to defend himself from such filth. I hope that an assortment of cheesy 80s hair bands reunite and release a complete album with Breathless playing in the background."
2,dougv,This book is not on the level of MacArthur's other books. He starts to repeathimself near the end of the first chapter.The rest of the book gives basic information--not much new after chapter one.I don't recommend buying this book.
5,Life Changing,I am 65 and have read many books. the vanishing conscience is one of the top five in my list. the world tends to harden hearts and this book has softened mine.
3,its ok,the reason we bought this dvd player is cause it can play all regions. the speakers are great. the dvd player how ever is iffy. if you pause the dvd for longer than a few minutes you have to shut off the dvd player and then start over.... resume never works and it constantly says wrong disc. but if you are willing to put up with that for great speakers and an all region player like we are its an alright system.
3,A photographic picture of the Republican Party.,"I have read the companion piece on the Democratic Party, and this book is just as nice. Both parties have long histories in our Republic. This book shows the foundation of the Republican Party in Ripon, WI to its present role. The photographs are worth a thousand words. This details the progress of our party from Lincoln to Bush II.There is not much meat in this book. The photos are great, and I got a reasonable summary history of the Republican Party. For a more detailed history, the reader should go elsewhere. As one of the previous reviewers noted, both books are companion pieces, so one should buy both to get a good library."
4,Norcross Hawkeye hand held sonar,I have a small sailboat without any power on board so this hand held unit is perfect for my application. The depth is very easy to read and the unit is easy to use. It does have to be in contact with the water (I have not tried the through hull reading) but on my boat that is not a problem. The unit is larger than I thought it would be but I think that this will be an advantage as it would fit perfectly in a cup holder for easy access. The water temp is also a nice feature. It uses 4 AA batteries in a nice holder for easy loading. It is well built and I look forward to many years of use.
2,Great while it lasts,"I purchased this about two years ago. It worked great up until about 3 months ago when the depth function stopped working. Just displays ""----"". Many of my associates in my office also use this tool and half of them have had to replace it because it did the same thing. Unfortunately, I need to buy another one because I need it. Pretty crappy deal though..."
2,Not a good buy,"As seen in several other reviews above, after about 3 or 4 occasional uses, the depth finder quit working showing only ""_ _ _ _"". Temperature still works. I changed batteries, and could not get the depth function to work. Not acceptable."
2,temp works great,"i got one for xmas, and it works great for temperature, but will not show the depth. I chatted with other ice-fisherman, and they explained they had to return to the store 2_3 times before they got one that would show depth. I am re-selling mine on e-bay. and wont buy another."
2,portable depth finder needs to be in water.,"The product description does not indicate that the product must be in the water to function, ie; if it is used in a boat it is recomended that the depth finder be placed in a plastic bag filled with water then placed against the hull for a ""through the hull reading"" it appears this product would work fine if your vessel was sinking. This product might work fine if you boat is built close to the water so you can drag it along by hand. It appears this product is an underwater transducer attached to the readout. To be fair, this product would probably work fine for swiming and diving but living in Michigan that is a few months away. It appears to be well built for it's intended use as an underwater instrument."
1,Not so good,"I used the sounder for 3 month, then it stop working, showing in the screen '----'Very expensive device, because of the short live."
1,"You know, they say 'Let dead dogs lie'","I would like to review this book well... I would like to say how wonderful this book is.I can't.This book is a perfect example of code that half the time only works well in Internet Explorer on Windows. Standards? No. JavaScript is pretty messed up too.In short, if you use this book for reference in building your website, make sure it isn't a professional site, or you might just lose customers.[the title is referring to when a dog dies, it may have a disease, and if you touch the dog, you may catch it. - this book is some what like that, it teaches you bad habits that may take a long time to fix.]"
2,"Works, but very Outdated!","At the time of this writing, this book is very outdated. What does it take to update a Book like this? Not very much. Animabets.com does not exist anymore, and they constantly cite examples using this website, not to mention any software they recommend is also way outdated, and their examples don't work with any current software. But I'm not saying you couldn't learn HTML using this book. It just wastes a lot of your valuable time."
4,Classic story,"Great story. Way more than what Disney made it out to be. Stuck with me since childhood. I have this Italian cartoon movie from the 70s translated into English. It's more accurate to the book, if you can find it."
5,Kids Are Enjoying It,My two 8-year-old girls are enjoying hearing me read one chapter a night of Pinocchio. The vocabulary is just a tiny bit above them so it provides a good opportunity to learn new words. The Grimly illustrations fascinate them.
5,Beautiful Cards,Purchased to give as a gift. Very attractive Tulip note cards with matching envelopes. Great quality and fast shipping. I would recomend them.
4,Who I am,Great teenage stories that draw students to want to read the book. I can't keep the series of books in my classroom. As soon as it's checked in it's checked out by someone else.
3,The Weakest of the Series So Far,"Caitlin continues to tell her tale through diary entries in this third installment of the series. This time she is a senior, dealing with race issues, suicide, dating, and other typical teenage woes. Some of the references and situations felt a little dated, namely the prolonged ""name dropping"" of the prayer of Jabez.It has been the weakest of the series so far for me, though still worth a read for those vested in the series. Something about the circumstances was a little cookie cutter and idealistic. I feel odd saying that, since some horrible tragedies take place, but even those tragedies felt too polished. I was excited to meet Chloe, since I had no idea that was coming, and am looking forward to quickly moving onto the fourth book.As with the first two books, the story is in first-person diary format. There are some sexual situations, though they are dealt with in a realistic and meaningful way that are meant to teach."
4,Another good read from Melody Carlson,"While I enjoyed the new installment of Caitlin's diary, I agree w/Jill from Ohio--it was not quite as good as the previous two.I think it was because a lot of the dialog didn't ring true. Some of the conversations Caitlin wrote about in her diary didn't sound believeable for teenagers. Also, the African American characters' conversations were not believeable. I also think she was beating a dead dog--so to speak--because she continued to belabor the ""to date or not to date"" issue.I would still recommend this book to teenage girls, and I am looking forward to the next book in the series!"
3,"pretty pictures, entertaining reading","The pictures are beautifully done, and the organization of clothes into the four seasons works out well. The self-consciously hip attitude was annoying though. This book would be useful for the very urban, fairly young, professional woman. Despite these limitations, this book is an entertaining read."
3,Pretty Book,"I agree with the people that said it is for people who are under thirty, live in N.Y.C. or L.A., and are under 115 pounds. But it does contain some helpful hints."
2,Nice pictures but not much help,"I agree with the reviewer who said ""if you're over 30 or don't live in NY/LA, don't waste your money."" (Also, if you weigh more than 115 pounds this book is only going to depress you.) I really wish I hadn't ordered it; it's of no use to me--which doesn't mean it wouldn't help some people, but only a small group of women."
3,More flash than content,"My mom got this book and I began to flip through it. It's a really fun book to look at -- great pictures, nice clothes -- but the layout is sort of annoying. IMO too much attention was paid to the look of the book and not the content. One thing that bothered me was that most of the outfits were probably hideously expensive (big labels = big cost) and the average woman probably would not be able to regularly afford most of the clothes shown. I can understand the ""buy less but buy better"" theory but, really, you could buy 3 perfectly good pairs of shoes for the price of the Blahniks the book raves about. The book is a nice jumping off point, but it's up to the reader to translate it into something that would work within their budget. The person who said that it's for the under 30, LA/NY crowd is mostly right, I think (although women over 30 shouldn't immediately discount this book); and I'd have to add that it would have to be an affluent crowd as well."
5,As timely in 2003 as when it was written several years ago.,"I adored this book. It gave great advice about dressing for every occasion, season and even city across the US and beyond."
3,"Disorganized, Pricey, but Some Good Ideas","This book has a very attractive cover, but it is not organized for a reader who is trying to follow it like a Do-it-Yourself Manual. The pictures were very nice and the clothes very nicely put together. I admit that I have to read the book cover to cover a few times before I could really put some of the good ideas into practices. So if you are looking for a Manual type book, this is not for you. Also, it's a bit pricey for what it's worth. The 'packaging of the book' (fancy layout, fancy photography) must cost a lot more than the content itself."
2,SONY RM-V701 Remote. Obsolete already,"The remote does not support DVD players nor does it supports many of the features of the SONY Surround Sound Home Theater System. However, I could not change the sound and effects options. It did effectively operate my RCA VCR and 50% of the functions of my RCA TV. The function switches are extremely hard to see in good light and impossible in low ""TV room"" light. It was merely a 1 to 1 replacement for my existing RCA VCR control. Nothing More."
1,Did not work as advertised,"The remote did not work with my Tocom cable box, which said was supported on the back of the package. Nuff' said."
4,I need a little help to reprogram,Our rm v8 got out of wack and I would like to reprogram it but I lost the instruction help
5,Fun pool float for kids!,"I purchased this float since my kids like to float in the pool but can't easily sit in an inflatable ring. The fruit slice is plenty large for a child, but an adult would have a difficult time lounging on it. The material seems durable and has held up well for the past month that we've used it.My only suggestion is that Amazon should let customers SELECT THE COLOR! I ended up with a ""lemon slice"" float that attracts sweat bees like crazy!"
5,Flower Water,"This stuff is amazing. I spray it in my face and inhale it often, especially in the summer when it's hot. Cools me right down and makes me think good thoughts. Love it!"
1,Spare me the tedium,"For some reason, I was excited to buy this game, but from the moment I popped it into the Playstation, I was continually disappointed. All right, it's great when you've got a thirty inch largemouth staring at your spinnerbait on the floor of the lake, and you know if you just twitch the line, he will strike. That's fun. But by and large the gameplay is tedious, the graphics are bland, the game world is dull, and there's very little to keep you coming back. Spend an hour with it and you've had enough. Where's the creativity? Where's the joy of sport? Suffice it to say, this doesn't even compare to the real thing. Turn off the darn Playstation this spring and go down to the lake or creek and cast for REAL fish. Better yet, take a bandsaw to your Bass Rise CD and make lures out of it."
5,"""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?"" -- The Album!","Please! Get this CD! I know, you all want the US version and blah blah blah. Just keep on talking! Come on! The UK version is just as awesome! It has all 74 amazing tracks from the television (or should I say ""tellie"") show! 2 bonus tracks remixed from the show's Theme. I personally like the lifeline sounds the best, but hey, you're taking advice from a 12 year old. Get this CD. What do you say? Will you get it? You've heard Regis Philbin (or Chris Tarrant) from the show, but now YOU'RE hosting. You call the shots. If anyone makes a mistake as final answer, you can let it go, or use the following ""wrong answer"" track. With currency printed on the track listing, who cares? The sounds are still great!"
4,"Good, but not great","About a month ago, I decided to get some better sounding phones to use in my studio. I bought a pair of Sony MDR-v900, and a pair of Sony MDR-7506 from their pro-line.The v900 sounds fine for non-critical listening, but the 7506 shows much more detail. If you really wanna hear what's in the mix, the 7506 is the ticket.The v900 does favors for low bit-rate mp3 encoded stuff, and it's pleasant to listen to...with a bit of a bump in the 100-200Hz region, but there's just not enough detail to be able to use for critical projects.I bought more pairs of MDR-7506...that should tell you something. There has been some talk that Sony may discontinue the 7506...sure hope that doesn't happen.BTW, the consumer MDR-v600 is NOT the same thing as the pro-line MDR-7506. The v600 sounds much more like the MDR-v900."
2,Terrible sound for the money.,"Having listened to many of the best consumer headphones available, I cannot recommend the MDR-V900s to anybody. Yes, they are very comfortable and have outstanding build quality, but the sound quality is really bad, especially considering the price tag.I would suggest to anybody interested in Sony headphones- take a look at the MDR-V6 or MDR-7506 models. These have sound that is literally at another level than the muddy, grainy V900. And they retail at about half the price.The secret is, you can go even cheaper yet and get something that sounds light years beyond the V900. A pair of Grado SR-60s or Sennheiser HD497s will completely embarrass the Sony V900s- I'm talking about crystal clear highs, excellent tonal qualities and near transparent sound. Compared to a good pair of headphones, the V900s are quite muddy. For what they cost, the lack of excellent sound is totally inexcusable."
4,Nice... I like...,"I'd wanted this album the moment I knew he was coming back mainstream. I'm really feeling track 4, Get Loose has a upbeat tempo and the language is comical. The lyrics throughout the whole thing's very catchy. Not too many tracks I don't care for. I can listen to the CD all the way through and not get annoyed. The big Teddy Bear has such a beautiful voice. Highly recommend."
4,Nice follow up from a good singer,"Ruben Studddard has the potential to be one of the best balladers in the game given the right material. With the recent passng of Gerald Levert and the passing of Luther Vandross & Barry White a few years there aren't many ballader's left in the field of R&B. Thankfully The Velvet Teddy Bear retunrs with his sophmore CD and gave me some hope. The first track Change Me had to grow on me, and while a good track it's one of the weaker tracks on the CD. Track 3 Make Ya Beautiful NEEDS TO BE A SINGLE ! Written by Ne-Yo, Make Ya Beautiful is one of the best songs Ruben has ever recorded. Other stonng ballads include Get U Loose,BlowYa Mind and his cover of If Only For One Night.Although there are some very weak moments on the CD,mostly the faster cuts, the ballads are what make the CD work. Ruben is a very stong and capable singer and proved that he deserves a place in R&B."
4,THIS IS FOR THE LOVER IN YOU,"I purchased this CD yesterday, Ruben brought his ""A"" game. There were only two songs that didn't really have that ""ummph!"" but the rest of the album is great!! I'm ready for another inspirational CD Ruben! Bring it on!"
1,ruben's on his last leg,the weight loss and the switch from gospel to R&b just ain't xselling records for ruben anymore well another soon to be soul casaulty.
5,Same wonderful voice,"I love this cd. Ruben looks great and sounds even better:)As for the last review below, why do you even bother to review cds? You give everything one star. Do you even like music? I wouldn't take your opinion very seriously."
4,RUBEN has Returned,This album is definitely better than his first.He needs to have more R&B; slow tracks.He tends to put in too many mid to up-tempo grooves.
4,This is so much better,This is a good cd. It seems more like Ruben than the first one. Nice grooves and decent lyrics. I can put this on in the car and have a nice smooth ride. I'm glad I picked it up.
1,Indistinguishable,"The thing I loved about Ruben during the competition was his retro sound that was fresh, clean, and unencumbered by the over produced, overly bass rifts that current, unimaginative music producers use.There is nothing in this album that is signature Ruben. There is nothing that stands out from the crowd. Its as if he is weakly saying, ""Me, too.""I'm going back to my old Marvin Gaye albums. I've lost hope that Ruben can bring soul back to the lost genre."
1,Same Old Tired Hip/Hop,"I don't know who talks these new artists into ""getting into the hip/hop vein"" but they all seem to do it. These records are repetitive and just plain boring! That bump de bump beat of Mary J. Blige's seems to have permeated EVERYBODY's records. It almost ruined Aretha Franklin with her dreary SO DAMN HAPPY.Ruben Studdard ought to come out of that boring bag and sing some real soul ballads, not this hip/hop junk that sounds like so many of the lesser people recording today. Ruben can be a very good singer, he proved that on American Idol. Now, he has fallen into the same bump de bump mode as the rest of this boring crowd. If he seriously wants to have a career, he's got to get serious about singing! This stuff won't do."
4,Better than most of this year's selections,"The 2002 Voyager calendar features images of all the regular cast members. Most are taken from actual episodes, not publicity stills. I always feel a bit cheated when they use publicity stills -- I want to see new and interesting images. I wish they would make a calendar of just various effects shots from Voyager instead of cast members (and hopefully in the style of the 2001 Ships of the Line calendar). It is getting a little boring having the same sort of thing year after year."
4,Bret vs. Ric is the reason to get this,The reason to get this tape is for the Flair/Hart match. At the time Flair was the challenger for Bret's I-C belt. It's not the greatest match those two had together but any chance you get to see them both work is historic. There's also a good match between Flair and a Rockers-era Shawn Michaels. Overall a good tape if you're looking for Flair era WWF.
4,Too Old!,"This tape is too old but some of the matches are good featuring Shawn Michaels,Ric Flair,Undertaker, and Bret Hart."
4,A History of American Acting,"Garff Wilson's Hstory of American Acting still ranks as one of the few scholarly histories of American theater acting styles during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. While Wilson's categories of acting styles are too indebted to the contemporary acting criticism of the era, it must be acknowledged that little to no additional work on this topic has been published up to date- at least not with the comprehensive scope characteristic of this work. For those who desire an introduction to acting styles in nineteenth century American theater, Wilson's book is a must."
5,Best ever,"Been using this forever !!! Don't know why they stopped selling it in the states, that's a big bummer !"
1,Manu is a junk scientist,"Manu is a notoriously unscientific ""scientist"". See his work on ""functional somatic syndromes"" in which he includes ME (aka CFS) which is a somatic disease which does not have ""medically unexplained"" symptoms. I wouldn't trust anything he's edited or written."
5,Ripley's Optimism Encourages Freelancers,"In a wavering economy, freelance writers have managed to hold their own, and with encouragement from authors like Kimberly Ripley---it's no wonder. She defines the how's, what's, where's, and why's of freelance writing and insists that writers get on their feet and do it! When she says ""Write Now!"" she means business.This is a must-read for those seeking advice for starting a freelance writing career."
5,"""Too Close on Purpose"" Close to Greatness","I really enjoyed this first release by singer/songwriter Mary Ann Vorasky. Her lyrics contain a lot of personal rawness and vulnerability as well as humor and artistry. The music is great, accessible, with a popular rhythmic style that drives the music along. Highly recommended."
5,"Excellent TV, Basic, will do all you need if you do not want HD","I purchased this product for my grandmother in law and it is more than enough for her needs, and an excellent buy for me. I already own a Sharp 32RS400 32"" MTS Stereo TV with PiP, and this tv is just as good. Great pictures, and 3 inputs (including component, S video, or AV depending on what you want to use). The price on this tv is also rediculously affordable, around ranging new from 260-320 dollars depending on what vendor you are using. Excellent purchase for basic tv, you will not be dissappointed. Updated full specifications are below."
1,warning,"the item that was shipped was not the item that was advertised, and it came damaged as well."
2,It was great while it lasted...,"I loved most of the features, but PIP was clumsy to use. The general design is good. The larger rubber feet were the first to go. Just came out over time. The latest is the charge. It keeps running out of juice, even if I place it next to a 500 watt halogen lamp for a few hours(not close enough to burn), or in the sunlight for the day. So even though I liked it at first, when it starts to die, you can't just put new batteries in, you have to replace it."
1,Don't waste your time and money,This remote is faulty by design. If you watch TV in dim light like most sensible people than this remote will dissapoint. Unless you take it outside during the day and set it in the sun it will not hold a charge well enough to keep the average channel surfer happy for an evening. Sony should know better than to design a product without battery backup.
4,Great sound at affordable price!,"The Sony MDR-V250V are great. Mostly, I used them at work to hear some music. The sound quality is very good (even at considerable high volume).One bad thing is that, as other reviewers have said, the headphones tend to bother your ears after wearing them for a while."
3,Not for people with big ears!,"Headphones sound good, volume control is nice in-line but, they are very small. Not sized for adults, would fit kids fine, makes ears sore after some time wearing."
1,Very disappointing,"I have had a pair of these headphones for little over a year, and am now looking to replace them. These headphones are relatively inexpensive, but other than that there is very little to recommend about them.The sound is OK, but the construction is very shoddy. As others have pointed out, the volume control will break over time, causing the intermittent loss of sound in one ear or the other. Additionally, the headband is very brittle; mine broke at the point where the adjustable slide for the right ear cup meets the main yoke.Finally, as an eyeglass wearer I found these headphones to be very uncomfortable. Regardless of how they are adjusted, the ear cups pinch the eyeglass frames between the ear and the side of the head."
4,lasted for 2.5 years before giving up,"I got mine in nov 2002 and i have used them primarily at work, which is sitting in front of a workstation for about 8-9 hours a day.most reviews have been very accurate. these are a bit tight even if you have an avg sized head. after about an hour of listening your ears do pain. i just got used to them and probly they have slackened up over time.but they are even more painful if you wear spectacles.also the cushion is pretty cheap and really not very helpful.the sound is decent. from my experience AVOID ANY HEADPHONES that have a volume controller since this is the weakest link in the chain. my headphones having finally given up at exactly this point. all in all they served me pretty well for 2.5 yrshope they made some changes to the model..."
2,Listening to music through a blanket,"Listening to music through these headphones is like listening to music through a blanket. Everything sounds muted, the highs don't extend very far, the lows are almost non existent. Their sound is anything but clear. Dynamics? Forget about itI'm looking for a $20ish pair of headphones to keep in my backpack at all times. I figured these might do the job...but wow was I wrong.I found the Sony MDR-XD100, which is actually cheaper, sound much better. Did I mention the build quality sucks? The XD100s are a little more durable but still leave much to be desired. Perhaps that's just low end Sonys in general?I'm thinking about just dropping the extra few bucks for a pair of Sennheiser PX100s or AKG K81DJs.My main headphones are the Grado SR-80 and BeyerDynamic DT990s...I know what good sounds like. All my music is either FLAC or 192 Kbps VBR mp3s.I'm giving these headphones a two star because I've heard worse...and much better for cheaper."
3,Sony MDR-V250V Head Phones,"Ok product, fit is not very confortable, but it was the only name brand inline volume control headphones I could fine. Next time I'll get higher quality head phones, with an addon inline volume control."
3,"Good sound, comfortable, but fragile","I bought these headphones for their aparent (from the pictures) comfort, Sony reputation, and price. When they work, these headphones sound really nice and are comfortable. If you aren't going to spend $100+ on Sennheisers or AKGs, then I think these are a good option.HOWEVER, within a year of owning these and using them very minimally (maybe only once every 3 to 4 WEEKS) the right speaker stopped working while I was sitting still at my desk listening to music at a moderate volume. I never dropped these headphones, tugged at the cord or anything like that. I realize all headphones are fragile, but come on! They break after a total of maybe 20 hours of use?!"
4,Good sound for money,"These are good quality headphones for the price. I have several pairs of expensive headphones but I don't like to take them to school (in fear of breaking them or having them lost). They sound good -if- you have a good source playing the music. If you have a 10 walkman the sound stinks, with a 200 sound card, they sound terrific. I am happy with them, Yeah, I would buy another pair. ---_Steve"
2,Too much of it looks like just excerpts from the online docu,"Unlike others of S. Holzner's books, this one contains large portionsthat look like just excerpts from the online Java documentation,with no explanations even when sorely needed. There are severalbetter books, ...The author should remember the rule: give a specific example for EVERYTHING!"
3,More Improvements Please,"One of the biggest problems I have found with the earbud headphones is that they always seem to fall out of my ears as I run. It seems that nothing I do help aleviate this problem. Another problem I've had not only with the earbud, but other sports headphones as well is sweat clogging up the speakers. I think I spend way too much time trying to keep my ears free of sweat as not too clog them up. I wish someone had a better idea for the perfect sports headphone. I'd love to hear anything."
1,Don't Last Long,"I bought a pair of these for jogging. I liked the feel etc, so i bought a couple more for use at home and in the office since they were pretty inexpensive.A couple of months in while running, one side stopped working. So I began using one of the other pair. A few weeks later, THAT one lost sound in one ear. So i went to the third pair - sure enough, yesterday IT crapped out.I love these earphones except for one thing: THEY BREAK EASILY.I CANNOT RECOMMEND!"
3,"quite durable, decent sound","I've had three pair of these now, going on nearly 10 years. The only reason I've replaced my previous two pair was because I lost them! One in a seatback on a plane. They're quite durable. The winding case helps avoid the usual wire failures. The sound is good, not great, but I'm fine with making the trade for durability and convenience. I laid in a second set as a spare for when I eventually lose them again!"
4,Works as stated,"I've been using these headphones for an hour or two each day for the last month and I am very pleased.They are sturdy, fit my ear well and the sound is good and clear.The only gripe I have is that the case isn't very well made and I fear that if it's dropped, it will break.Pretty good bank-for-buck, if you ask me, although I have yet to test their water resistance."
3,I love them! When they work...,"These don't stop working when I sweat, which all of my other ones would do. love the handy case and the sound is good. I bought another pair I liked them so much.edited on 1-8-12. left earbud stopped working."
5,They really are the best,"I always use ear-bud headphones when walking, for some reason the over-the-ear headphones give me headaches. So I've always also just assumed that I'd never have clear sound. No more! These headphones are wonderful.The range of music I like is very much varied. These sound great for all types, and most surprisingly is their ability to handle resonant bass in some newer songs. I'm really amazed, actually. It's weird having sound that's as good as a nice stereo when you're walking the dog.One setback is that I need to use the foam covers because the plastic buds along fall out of my ears at the slightest tug of the cable. It's a setback for me. Maybe my ears are getting bigger as I get older? This has never been an issue. Regardless, it's a tiny fault for the best, cheapest headphones I've ever bought."
2,a real review,"tired of reviews cranked out by the marketing department of the company in question? well here is an actual review by an impartial CONSUMER:honestly, there are a lot better headphones on the market, but if you want to exercise in them... good luck. i've gone through two other sets of headphones before using these, the previous pairs died under the deluge of sweat proffered by my overheating body, but these sony's, they are still alive; for now. anyways, sound quality = so-so, but you're excercising so deal."
5,Huggies,Beautiful earrings and just what I thought they would be. The price was right and they shipped out when they said they would.
2,Not the best in sound quality,"I thought I was getting the same quality with these pair of headphones like I did with its similar model (MDR-201) that doesn't have the in-line volume. The design is the same but the sound quality stinks. The other pair of headphones I had was not available any more so I decided to purchase these. The design is the same, length of cord the same, but the sound was not. I tried to mess with the volume control on the cord and the device, but still got bad sound. Some of the tones you couldn't hear. You can hear the different pitches of music which wasn't good. It wasn't a clean cut of listening music at all. The reason why you buy headphones is for the sound, this one doesn't cut it. I don't recommend this product at all."
1,DON'T BUY IT,"I can not believe this is a Sony!When I connect it with my portal cd player, The sound is so sucks, and i feel the singer is so far away from me (weird?). And the volumn control can only manage a very small range.I have a $$ Philips, which can provide much much better than this one. And I have a Sony MDR-CD280, which is a little expensive than this one ($$ from fry's), but provide much much better sound. And I have a sennheiser HD 580, nevertheless to say, it is the best among all headphones i have, but it is too expensive (about $$$).After all, I strongly recommend u do NOT buy this thing."
1,Not a big country fan,"Seeing Shelby on a TV spot convinced me that I must have some of her music. This album may have her classic background, but is nothing like her current sound which I think is great! This can be skipped by anyone who doesn't really like country sounds. Maybe this is the reason her new album is titled ""Identity Crisis"" - nothing like her old stuff. Sorry, buy the new but pass on this expensive oldie. (PS, I also like her new hair style better :-)"
1,Pass,"I was looking forward to hearing these tunes based on the (1) positive review, but if you are a gospel fan, pass on this set. They were ""remastered"" in someone's imagination. Surface noise is so prevalent in many tunes, you cannot make out the lyrics. There are also far too many songs by a single group or artist, no less than 12 by ""Ernest Phipps & His Holiness Queartet."" Most of the ""Mountain Gospel"" selections sound as if they were one-take specials from a carnival recording booth. They have historical value, but the wildly off key voices and amateur accompaniment quickly relegtated this set for my recycle bin."
1,This book does not exist,"I am the author of ""Early Polish Modern Art: Unity in Multiplicity."" My book was published in December 2005. This book does not exist--it is probably a pirated copy of my later book.Dr. Marek Bartelik"
2,One Touch Can opener,"Didn't work as advertised. I just put it in a drawer and there it sits. Thought it would be a good thing for my friend who had a stroke, but it did not work."
3,put em' together and you get...,"If you watch Rainbow, then watch me and my shadows you get a really in depth view of Judy's life - even if parts of it are a bit over dramatic. I didn't pay a cent for this movie - someone gave me a copy and I don't think I would pay more than twenty bucks if I ever come across a copy; it just isn't worth it - but teamed with Me and my shadows it works ohk - it gets a bit of a boost."
3,Playalong CD and Notation does not match full song,"I use a lot of guitar playalong book/CDs. I bought this one for the Bryan Adams demo. Most of the time, the CDs feature second and third guitar parts, although it will not be in the notation. For this song, the CD left off the lead guitar portions - very dissappointing.Other than that, the notation of the rhythm guitar was solid and sounded good on the CD. I don't know about the other songs so take what you will from my review."
1,"This book has no valuable information. It is bad, very bad.","If you have spent at least one week in the business world, and have any common sense whatsoever, you do not need this book.It is 58 pages of valueless tripe. An example comes from the author's chapter on Office Meeting Etiquette... ""When it is raining, wear a raincoat to protect your clothing and an umbrella to keep your hair and face dry."" This insightful gem is shortly followed by: ""Have a pad and pen handy for taking notes during the meeting"".However, if you find yourself needing to know how to address a king, queen, or president then this book is for you.This book (my copy at least) came complete with typo's that were hand corrected with an ink pen.Do not waste your money on this book."
5,anytime,Everything was great price of my horns they came on time just like it was stated everthing was on time.
1,Not a book for me,"I guess I am not typical of the other reviewers, because I am a 13-yr old girl and I found it dreadfully boring. It had too many facts and not enough storyline; not a fan of pirates so that didn't add to the magic for me. This book is too much like non-fiction. I had to read it for school, along with many other books that were recommended in our reading program, and it was my least favorite of all of them."
4,"This is a good book, but Granger's translation is better.","I really enjoyed reading this fascinating book. However, when I compared it to another translation (a two volume edition, translated by Granger) it seemed that it was missing some bits of information.It was easier to read though, so if you are interested in a casual read, this is the book for you. For a research project, you should probably stick to Granger's books."
1,Not Illustrated!,"I downloaded the sample and saw the ""Image not Available"" icon and assumed they just withheld it for the trial version, but no, this edition nonsensically lacks the illustrations in the slightly older edition of the book. good thing it was only 99 cents. Maybe the translation is better, haven't gotten that far yet, but to start out with that gaping void in a book talking about aesthetics among other things is rather disappointing."
5,A Treasured Book,Great Book. Was not dissapointed in the description given at time of auction and good service. Will definately buy again.
3,Don't buy this one!,"i do not recommend to buy this unit, the big problem, that they made the power supply to this unit 18v it makes difficult to connect with different power adapters, as most ones are 12v, especially if you want to connect with external 12v battery! as a result I recommend Behringer PS400 which requires only 12v to power! there is also a generic model of this unit, same color, same case but different brand name and with 12v power supply, look it up on the famous E bay auction site. but i would go with Behringer as it is more portable compare to samson, as it is very bulky, once you open up this unit, you will realise that there is not much inside at all. So stay away from this 18v unit."
5,Wonderful! An excellent read; highly recommended,"I love Dorothy Gilman's Mrs. Pollifax series (particularly the early books -- through and including Mrs. Pollifax on Safari, although I still eagerly read all of them as soon as they're published), and adored A Nun in the Closet. Although I hadn't expected to like this one, I was very pleasantly surprised. It is thoroughly entertaining and enjoyable -- one of the few mysteries I've saved to reread."
2,Missing parts,There were a lot of missing parts in this model. Even the windshield. Will never buy this brand again. Very disappointing and very frustrating.
4,Lilting Halloween Read-Aloud,"One witch treks about collecting a shopping bag full of ghoulish ingredients for her stew. Told in rhyme, it's also a counting book from one to ten and then back down: ""Five vampires on the loose, gave the witch some fresh blood juice.""The mummies, scarecrows, ghosts and skeletons contributing to the stew are mostly a jolly sort illustrated in a variety of poses and suitably murky colors. The tenth grouping of characters (werewolves) disturbed me a little with their oversized heads and sharp teeth. I deducted one star for this.The story ends with all the characters partying and enjoying their stew. The pacing and excellent illustrations make this a natural for reading to a group of preschoolers at Halloween."
5,Get This Album,"I doubt it would be going too far to say that this is one of the best, if not the best, album of the year. Oliver Lieb is a masterful composer as each track flawlessly blends into the next. Beautiful ambience and lush soundscapes pervade this record. Not one person who I've recommended this album to has been disappointed."
2,A very dissapointed Fan,"I have several of LSG's other CD's including the new ""Hive"" which is absolutely fantastic, but this CD is very dissapointing. The entire CD sounds like background music to a Sci-fi Flix. If you where expecting Trance, you will be extremely dissapointed. Buy ""Hive"" or LSG's first CD, you won't be dissapointed on that asect"
4,Very different....,"I'm used to oliver lieb creating trance/deeptrance tracks... when I bought this cd I was expecting something like the black album or Vol.2 but what I heard was oppisite of that. This was in the genre of ambience/chillout/trip-hop type music...and I liked it. I usually listen to this cd during stressful times at work to cool me down-it'r a relaxer. It's nice to see Oliver lieb try new types of music, this just shows that he's constantly expanding his skills. If you buy this cd and like it then go buy Thee-o's Reef Project, it's pretty laid back just like this cd."
1,Wrong Product,"To all the R & B listeners,If you are looking for some music from LSG ( Levert, Sweat & Gill ), this is not it!!! It is not what you want. I made a mistake!! Don't do the same thing!!! It was not at all the music I wanted!!!"
1,hoodwinked,"i bought this digitally under the impression it was the same as the disc with bonus material, (cause all i want and what is the hardest thing to find is the medway remix)but it is just a ""seamless mix"" of the original full length only, no medway remix:(i think amazon can better link and label the products they offer when there are significant differences between the 2.all sales final is lame, i mean i don't want what i bought, i'll delete it i promise hell i might as well i'll never listen to it."
5,a hybrid mixture of ambient and trance music,"This album is another brilliant journey created and orchestrated by the god of trance Mr Oliver Lieb. A simple and stunning album that flirts on the precebus of trance and ambient music is the final product given to the masses and it sure as hell delivers. You will get a set of tracks here that are emotionally beautiful and calming with ocassional interjection of massive buildup trance tracks. its literally an accoustical roller coaster that feels like something is lifting your mind only to throw it right into the pit of deep trance.In the end, you have an amazing and brilliant album thats relaxing, and at the same time very heart pounding. There is a little bit of female singing towards the end of the album that will leave you breathless. Its one of the most organically perfect fusions of female vocals with trance music. Welcome to half ambient half trance rollercoaster journey. A+"
3,Try before you buy!,"The fit of this head phone is a little different than others that I have used. As you can see from the picture, it hangs over your ear. It does not fit very tightly against your ear. That lets the noise around me mingle with the earbud's sound so it is not very clear. The volume control you see in the photo can be used to increase the volume in the ear piece. The result for me was to make the sound louder but not more clear. The loose dangley fit never seemed comfortable to me.The sound listeners hear coming from the microphone can be adjusted by sliding a micro switch to one of three levels. The highest level is not adequate for some phones and people I called had trouble hearing what I was saying. You need to try this headset with the phone you want to use it with. It will work well with some but not with others. You may want to consider the return policy of the seller and the shipping charges involved."
1,"Waste of Money, and Time.","This is a worthless item that no one can even hear you on. I can hear them great, but the mic in this little baby is poor, poor, poor. Amazon will get this piece of junk back. The one star required is a WAY too generous rating for this product."
3,Good product until the EarBudeez wears out,"This is a good headset with good volume and mic. Works good with cell phone or office phone. The only problem I have found is that when the ""EarBudeez"" (the little rubber thingie) wears out (and it will) it is impossible to find a replacement. I called Plantronics and they gave me the number to a wholesaler. I called the wholesaler and they do not even carry the replacement part. The wholesaler had no idea where I could get a replacement"
3,Mediocre like all Pantronics products,"THis headphone set was disappointing, but I should have known since every Plantronics item I have ever owned has been mediocre at best and has not lasted. I do not know how they have gotten a good reputation. Volume on mic and earpiece have to be at maximum to use and then it is marginal. It does not fit well in the ear and is too heavy and unbalanced. Only plus is that it has an excellent silent mute button so other party does not know you have muted the mic."
1,You get what you pay for...,"The M145 does deliver quality sound. However, the M145 is not a satisfactory headset if you plan on wearing it for long periods.The metal ""behind-the-ear loop"" needs adjustment everytime you put the headset on. The molded soft plastic inner ear retainer constantly slips off, etc., etc.Once you do finally get the M145 in place, it is comfortable to wear... but after two hours or so, you will need to readjust the metal ""behind-the-ear loop"" otherwise it will begin to rub uncomfortably against the back of the ear.Then again, what do you expect for [$]?"
2,No one could hear me.....,"After reading all of the reviews it seemed that this was the headset for me. Unfortunately, my experience was not so good. Although this product seems well made, is easy to use, and I could hear the person on the other end (which is why I've given two and not zero stars)...the person on the other end could not hear me. I was aware of the possible problem with the mute button so I made sure it was ""off"", and I tried it four different times. Curiously, the only time I could be ""heard"" was when I called my cell phone and left a voice mail. I suppose it could be that my cordless phone is not of high enough quality (Uniden), but, nonetheless, it must go back."
1,Bad,"I have this kind of dress form for almost 10 years, I very like it that I can adjust to different size, but the adjustment that dail to the different size are broken, because it made from very cheap plastic. One time I try to call to order the parts, they send me the form and I send the order with my check, that what they offered. I never heard from them untill now. Bad customer service."
4,Updated review!,"After the package was located, and i received it. I am excited about using my new dress form to start alternating my clothing, and creating new clothes with it. I am thrilled about the response of the company selling the item, and UPS, finding out what happened to it, and locating the item after it was lost. Excellent service after it being sent to wrong location."
1,SAVE YOUR $$$,"What a waste of time & money!!! I'm happy to get rid of mind if any wants it, just pay for shipping. But be warned, it's wobbly uneven stance flimsy plasitic & RED!!! What was I thinking???? I can't pin up dark fabrics on this pc of CRAP!!! It blends into the deep red and forget pictures!!! If you have a dark garment you won't be able to see clearly where the neckline ends in pictures. This is the worst dress form EVER!!!! On second thought I think I'd rather burn it then to give it to my worst enemy!!!! SAVE YOUR $$$ & DON'T BUY THIS PC OF CRAP!!! TAT FROM BROOKLYN!!"
3,Review of Dritz Dress Form,"The product was well wrapped and contained and in good condition when it arrived. It was very easy to put it together, and to learn to alter the form to fit my figure.The product itself has all the mechanisms for altering the form to conform to actual figure size.I am a bit disappointed in the lack of sturdiness of the product. It will have to be used with care as the interior frame is plastic and not that strong. It is fine for a non professional sewer, but would never stand up to constant usage and change of shape.I am not a professional sewer, and with care I think the product will be fine."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY,"i guess you get what you pay for. However, I expected this dress form to be of a better quality than it is. It's very flimsy, flopping all over the place. Anything can make it tip over. Feels like it is made of paper, with no foundation weighing it down. I would not recommend this to anyone, at least anyone who is looking for an alternative to the more expensive dress forms. This can just be used for light projects, until you are able to acquire a better quality dress form used by professionals."
3,Good basic form,This dress form is limited in how much you can adjust it to fit your shape but considering the price it works well. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a low cost dress form.
2,This Product Did Not Thrill Me,"This product did not define my curls and dried my hair out. It also has Parabens in it, which is a no-no for naturals. I'm going to be mailing it to my cousin. Who by the way, has the same hair type as me(4a/b) and she LOVES this stuff. It just goes to show that you have to try products for YOURSELF. A review is just just someones opinion on a product. Does not mean it will not work magic for you!! :-)"
2,It's true what they say about the new formula.,"I read tons of reviews on how the new formulation of this product destroyed the good things people loved about it. But I thought, since I've never used it maybe I'd like it since I couldn't compare it to the old forumula. Wrong. My immediate reaction was ""Ok...we may have something here""! It defined my curls and it had a nice healthy sheen. But as it dried things went down hill. It became hard and stiff. Not as stiff as my regular styling gel, but weird stiff. I did use it in a twist-out and LOVED those results, but that's not what I bought this product for. I'll continue to use it for twist-outs until it's gone and then try my luck with a different activator gel."
4,Worked perfectly,This one paid off well for me. It works with my mobile phone perfectly. I would definitely recommend this to any of my friends. Thanks.
5,No surprises,It is exactly what it said it was. Happy with it. And most importanlty it works! You just need to download a software from nokia's website which it really straightforward.
3,Great cartton of my childhhod,"I considered this rating although the service was great. The entire collection was not available. There are still over 100 epiosde not yet available. There is no wrod when or if they will be made availabe, or alternate site to but the show from."
3,Mid-range rating due to possible incomplete release...,"I remember watching this show every morning before school and to finally be realeased on DVD is fantastic news to me. I am somewhat concerned with the new price and possible minimalized content in this release, and I am obviously not alone.There were 128 individual stories in the original run, each was approximately 5 minutes long. BY my calculation, that would be 640 minutes - or 10 hours, 40 minutes. This is a vast difference from the noted 110 minutes.I hope that that details are in error, but considering the price I'm getting prepared for disappointment."
2,Not the Herculues I remember.,I know I watched this as a kid but this is not the Herculues I remember. This may have been the original series andlater on they added different characters. It is the same Hercules cartoon but none of the episodes i remember. i wishthey had released the entire series. anyway it was good to see again and would be a great gift for any kid as I'm givingmine to my nephew for xmas! I want him to see what good classic cartoons really are and not the crap they show now!
3,pop up not,"nice slim design, fits in tight places, serves its basic purpose BUT the spring mechanism can be fussy. Followed the directions but sometimes it works.. sometimes it does not which can be annoying if you have to drag the holder from its corner and reach in to get the bottom roll because no amount of resetting will bring it up."
5,The journey continues...,"Once again, Lynn Andrews brings the insights and wisdom she has gained in the journey of her life to the rest of the world. Her teachers, the Sisterhood of the Shields, have guided Andrews through her own challenges and tests, which has been documented in her previous books. Now Andrews brings all of this knowledge together, as if she is surrounding it with a circle or a hoop, in her book, the Tree of Dreams. Andrews does not pretend to have all of the answers, nor does she try and represent a particular native culture. She simply shares the teachings she has received from an ancient group of wise women, and she recounts her own examples of how she has had to learn and grow. I am glad she has chosen to bring this to the world."
5,tree of dreams,this was an excellent book about a journey to the innerself and womanhoodi would recommend this book to anyone
1,This book was so terrible I just quit reading it half way through.,This book was so terrible I just quit reading it and threw it away. Dungeons and dragons and witches and devils.
4,Nice Collection,"The book has a very good collection of articles from many important car magazines like Motor Trend, Car and Driver, Motor Sport, Road & track, etc. they all are articles talking about Porsches from 1990 to 1997 and cover comparison tests, specifications, performance and model specific details. If you like to buy and keep these type of magazines for certain articles, AND, you are a 911 fan, this is the book for you! I'd like a porsche company edition myself but this is a very nice collection from other magazines articles."
5,I love this book!,"Well it wasn't written, more a collection of old articles on the cars. The print is mostly black & white, & some of the pictures are not the best. But it's the writing that is cool. I love looking at what they thought of the cars when they were new, & how they stacked up to what else was out there. They also put in a bunch of the Euro magazines. Lots of good data with graphs, charts & pretty much covers every 911 variant from that time. I was surprised to find all the positive reviews of Tiptronic, guess it was cutting edge, now even Hondas have it."
5,What a story!!!,"Willis offers the best novel I've ever read on foster care--especially as it relates to interracial issues. Her main character, Alice Marlowe, is a bit of a stiff old maid who comes ALIVE when she rescues (is rescued BY, actually), little Larissa, an adorable child abandoned (maybe) by her mother. As a deaf sign language interpreter, Alice has been able to live one step away from Life, merely translating the frustrations and anger and joys of others. Now, with the recent death of her twin brother and the entry of Larissa into her stagnant life, she becomes engaged with the joys and passsions that life brings, must go through one of those ""life passages"" that make it all worthwhile. It's about love--love for others most of all, but also love for oneselfI can't recommend this novel highly enough."
4,We all need love,"Alice Marlowe, 48 years old, single, a sign-language interpret is awakened by a phone call one night. Larissa Benton, 6 years old, is left by herself for 19 hours. Larissa quickly becomes a foster child. Alice decides she wants to help Larissa. They had already formed a unique bond; Alice teaching Larissa how to sign. Michelle, Larissa's mother, is distraught at losing her child, and haunts Alice. It is heart-warming to see how Alice's parents and nephews interact with Larissa. Alice struggles with learning how to be a good foster mother. Larissa rescues Alice from her despair and loneliness. Skillfully written novel that shows how powerful love can be no matter whom we are."
5,sega gameshark,"play and learn and win! with sega gameshark, the games last longer, and i'm able to find ""hidden"" prizes and rewards. the traps that would normally catch me, and end my game, are less dangerous, giving me a better chance of continuing my quests, puzzles or races. it's not an automatic win, just a tool to help me play better. i recommend sega gameshark for anyone who still has dreamcast, and isn't able to play some of the old games."
5,I love it!,"If you are looking for a great CD, you've found it now. When you first listen to La Prima Vez you notice the enormous care about quality they had making this CD. Fortuna's voice is huge and the songs are beautiful and delightful. I'm sure you'll want to buy all her CDs at the moment you finish listening this one."
3,Not what I had hoped,"For the vast majority of people, this translation will serve its purpose well. However, as someone studying Mozart on the graduate level, this translation does not serve the composer. It is fraught with too much contemporary garble, and censors much of the vulgarity that makes Mozart such a delightful psychological study. Of course, we can blame Nissen for starting this trend, but I was hoping for a translation that sought to reveal the man rather than continue to laud the legend."
4,Another great novel from Erdrich,"Two stories are intertwined here, and I didn't want either one to end! Erdrich's amazing writing brings these characters into vivid focus, and the story is so compelling. She shows us people as they really are: sometimes admirable, sometimes despicable, sometimes pitiful -- but she always depicts them with compassion. I will remember this book for a long time."
4,Interesting story,"I had finished ""The Round House"" by Louise Erdrich and wanted to read more of her works. Years ago I read one of her books and enjoyed it. She weaves a good story as well as presenting interesting characters. This particular novel includes a present day introduction in New England, shifts to a heartbreaking story on an Indian reservation which happens in the past and sets the tone for the focal point of the drum and then back to present day both on the reservation and in New England. She is a masterful writer."
4,Worth reading,I really like all of Louise Erdrich's books. I don;t think this was as strong as some of her other works but well worth the read
5,"Louise, my guiding light on Native experience","So well written and beautifully expressed. A fantastic story teller weaves time, culture and interior exploration. I'm so grateful for her body of work."
4,New to Erdrich,"This book was assigned reading for a writing class I am taking. Since I had no idea why it was assigned, I read it just to enjoy and I did find it both informative and thought provoking.The switch between the past and present is smooth and some descriptive passages are wonderful.This was an enjoyable read for me, and we are still using parts of it for discussion in class. I will read more of her books."
4,Pleasantly surprised,"A friend recommended this to me, and it sat in a stack for nearly 9 months, until one day I picked it up. The author was unknown to me, and it wasn't something I'd have selected for myself. However, after reading just a few chapters, I was drawn into the story.I was a little miffed after the first storyline ended, fairly abruptly in my mind. I wanted to get back to these characters. However, I found myself getting so caught up in the other two storylines that I forgot I was miffed.In the end, of course, the storylines connected as their lives were intertwined. It wasn't a neat, storybook ending. Rather it gave some clues and let me imagine a bit on my own.While it's not my all-time favorite book, it was definitely worth my time!"
3,Not quite what I had hoped,"I was excited to read ""A Painted Drum"" after reading ""The Roundhouse"". But at the end I found myself wondering why the author filled so many pages at the front of the book with details of her characters that didn't really have anything to do with the story! The middle of the book, the stories told after the drum is returned, were wonderful. I was a little annoyed that it took the author so long to get to that part! (sorry) I didn't want to put the book down after getting to that part. The ending was bland and disappointing. I am definitely going to try another one of her books though."
2,Pass on Erdrich's latest,"I've got one word to sum up this book - yawn. I've been a fan of many of Erdrich's earlier novels, such as The Bingo Palace, and Love Medicine. Erdrich has made a name for herself as a writer who vividly portrays the balancing act of Native Americans in a westernized world. Sadly, The Painted Drum doesn't live up to her earlier writing, and is beyond boring. Erdrich seems to be following in the vein of movies these days, that is to say forgetting to include a plot. The book begins as a dull and detailed description of sifting through the junk in someone's attic, which is about as interesting as watching paint dry in someone's attic. I was so bored I couldn't even finish listening to the book. Do yourself a favor, and pass on The Painted Drum."
3,Life and Death,"Life and DeathI thought The Painted Drum by Louise Erdrich had both good and bad qualities. I didn't like how the book was structured or some of the characters. Faye's story didn't really have anything to do with the drum. I know she found it and in some way it helped her move on in her life, but that was barely discussed at all. I don't think Fay added much to the story. I would rather have heard more about Bernard and Ira. Also, the Pillager family tree seems to stretch far and wide. I found it hard to keep track of who was related to whom.What I liked about this novel was the theme. It had to do with both life and death. Many of the characters didn't know at first why they should live, yet near the end everyone found a purpose for their lives. Some of them were also able to come to terms with the death of their loved ones. That's not a very easy thing to do. I think the moral in this book has a lot to teach people about life and how to get past death."
2,Not Good,"This is a remaindered copy, which is fine, but instead of the standard single black line on the outer bottom of pages, this has several..several red ballpoint pen lines scribbled over the top outer edge of the pages. I do no appreciate this......"
1,The painted drum,"This was a very disturbing book. It carried such a feeling of despair that it took me a long time to shake it off. The story was a good one, but why did the characters have to be so unhappy and disfunctional? Such a horrible feeling of hopelessness prevailed."
1,Doesn't stay on ear.,"Doesn't stay on the ear. I had one like this - SUPPOSEDLY exactly the same - for YEARS and years, finally broke - but this one is NOT exactly the same, and didn't stay on my ear. However, the sending-company was good about giving a refund."
4,Follow the directions and manage your expectations....,"1. Following the directions, you give the devices a local password before you start using them on your network. After that, they just work. OK, I tried to skip the local password step. They would run for a day or two at a time and then they'd drop off my LAN. After supplying the local password, they've run fine for a couple of weeks. They do a great job of transferring media to my Tivo Series 2 (Humax) that sits on the other side of my house. Even with booster antennas of various sorts, I never got 802.11g to connect reliably in that location.2. Linksys is up front that the listed connection speed is a theoretical maximum you probably won't reach on a regular basis. I tried moving my HP Media Vault to the other side of the powerline adapters from my desktop machines and the backups started taking more than twice as long to execute. I've moved the Media Vault back where it was."
5,Excellent and simple to use hardware,"This really is just 'plug and play', even on 25 year old electrics it still gives lightning fast connection speeds. An excellent (working) alternative to the wi-fi adapter on the 360 which is susceptable to interference and struggles with hi-def TV."
2,no good for dish receivers,"Got this for dish network receiver vip 622,, too fast of speed 'does not work for broad band.e-mailed the seller to see about return, still haven't gotten backwith me. You be the judge! , it's been 3 weeks now."
1,Warning: Do NOT purchase these from Amazon,"Amazon will not stand behind their delivery contract. I purchased this item, eight days ago, paying for ""expedited"" 3-day delivery; as I had a deadline which is now long past. The product still has not arrived, and amazon sidesteps responsibility for the sale; instead, redirecting the buyer to the subcontractor - despite the fact that Amazon is the selling party. The product is excellent: I suggest Best Buy, Comp USA or any one of a number of other suppliers."
1,Didn't work for me,"I tried this product at home. After a week of use I started to run into the problem that the connection dropped frequently. Talked to Linksys support. They recommended a firmware upgrade. I managed to ruin my Linksys device while applying the firmware upgrade. Linksys support was so nice to send a free-of-charge replacement unit. However, it turned out the (refurbished) replacement unit was dead-on-arrival. Linksys support now refuses to send me a second replacement unit. I'm giving up. I did wast a lot of time with this device. I cannot recommend it to anybody.Footnote.Now I'm using the competing Panasonic product. This product works like a charm! It was very easy to install (no software required, just plug it in). And last but not least, it's about $40 less expensive than the Linksys product."
5,Linksys PLK200 Powerline AV Ethernet Adapter Kit,I am using this device with Direct tv HD DVR for on-demand programing and it works great. I was concerned about the HD transfers but it's not a problem.
4,Works Great,"This adapter kit was very easy to install, Load a CD, plug in one adapter close to my router and one in the Living room near my DVD player and hook up the ethernet cables. It worked instantaneously.The only downside I can report is that the indicator lights on these are really bright. Bright enough to see through the tangle of wires and components in the entertainment setup, and bright enough to act as a nightlight in my office. I finally covered the lights in the living room with tape."
3,Please understand yor house's wiring prior to purchase,"I just had my basement finished and wanted a simple solution to connect to my network without installing additional wires. I decided to try the Linksys Powerline Adapter. It turns out though that my basement wiring is not on the same circuitry as the main floor of my house where my router is, so the adapter does not work. I just spoke with customer service and they confirmed this (their suggestion was to run an extension cord from my main floor to the basement!!!). I did test the adapter on the main floor where my router is and it worked fine (the reason why I am giving three stars and not less), so I have no doubt this adapter is worth it, assuming you are connecing on the same circuitry. Unfortunately nowhere on the packaging did Linksys feel it important to mention this ( I would think this would fall under the Minimum Requirements section!!)"
1,Doesn't Support Vista,"Hello. The PLK200 does not support vista. How is that possible? It's absolutely stunning that in August of 2008 that Linksys can't get this to work. It also took over 45 minutes of wasted time (including being disconnected) with the linksys support team before they could figure it out (despite my upfront disclosure that I was running vista). Also, a sarcastic thanks to amazon for prominently displaying this fact on the product info page."
1,Waste of money,"Not sure if the problem is with the house wiring or the devices, but it simply did not work!!!The walking distance is about 15 m ( about 50 ft ), but the signal was so poor that it did not work (it gave 1 - 5 )I tried different wireless devices from Linksys (like the WRT300N) before buying these hoping that they will work were the wireless did not ... but it was a waste of moneyMy advice would be not to buy these (PLK200) and to install a proper CAT5 network wire, cheaper and it will workPerit"
1,Disappointing,"When it worked, it was awesome! Unfortunately, when I moved the adapters to other outlets, they stopped registering any networking signal whatsoever. I was never able to determine the source of the problem: the 'user help' was unhelpful, the networking interface was confusing, and eventually I gave up. Btw, these products contain lead, so handle with care."
4,MC5 - 'Teen Age Lust' (Total Energy) 4 1/2 stars,"I've said it before and I'll surely say it again. I just love these unreleased archive concert performances released on CD. Specially when it's of a tour / gig that you wouldn't ordinarily expect. This ten track gem was recorded on January 1, 1970 at the Civic Center in Saginaw, MI. It's sound quality is between very good to excellent. Several MC5 treasures included in the set, just sounds so much better when played live. Most notable cuts are the title track ""Teen Age Lust"", ""Looking At You"", ""Human Being Lawnmower"" and the foot-stomping ""Black To Comm"" which is squeezed into a medley with ""Starship"" and ""Kick Out The Jams"". Guitarist Fred Smith steps up to provide the vocals on ""Shakin' Streets"". This version kicks ass!! Nice cover."
4,A little bit... creepy. But good.,"This is described as ""sweet"" and ""lovely"" by other reviewers. I'm probably just a bad person or something, but initially I just get a sort of creepy feeling from it. Maybe you have to read the whole series to get it. Right now it's just disturbing me. I'm not saying it's not good; it's terrifically well written and drawn and told. I think part of the reason it's giving me the crawlies is *because* it's so well done. If it were silly, or dumb, it wouldn't be nearly so affecting. But Clamp - the quartet of women who write it - take their craft seriously, and it shows.Initially it's about a very, very innocent girl who lives alone. A man moves in next door. She likes him...The emptyness of the rooms, the teddy bears sitting on the floor to see her off and greet her; you can almost hear the silence of the house. That's what's giving me the shivers. Ignorance is not bliss. I'll probably have to read the rest of them or it's going to bug me forever."
1,Lamest CLAMP title yet....,"I love Clamp. I loved X, Chobits, Rayearth and Wish. But this is terrible! The heroines of Clamp stories are usually pretty dim, but in this book, the herione is actually severely retarded. For real. And it just isn't fun to watch. She is described as an ""idiot savant"" by one character, but she unfortunately, is just being nice. Her classmates are unrealistically nice to her. If Hinata were a real high school girl, she would be mercilessly teased by everyone around her. She is a high school girl who sings nursery rhymes and reads picture books. She's clueless about sex and everything else in the world. The art is poor, the story lame, and the heroine the dumbest of all."
5,Huge World To Create You Fate,This game is huge! The setup of your character is a very interesting/cool way of doing this. If you like or want a game that is very open ended THIS is the game for you.I purchased the Xbox Version of this game and the Graphics and sounds are very very good. The first time I played I only played for 2 hours and I didn't explore too much of the world in that time because it is so big.The game looks great on the Xbox and the playability of the game is very easy with some easy customization of the games control system.An overall great game!
2,Buy the computer not xbox version,"If you are into Role playing games....this is a decent game, but not the greatest. Character development is great, The story line is good, graphics are good, but the fighting is pretty lame.Also, DO NOT BUY IT FOR XBOX, pick up the pc version. The game itself contains so much data that the game often locks up and loses and unsaved information. You end up either frustrated or saving the game over and over every ten minutes. I thought I had a faulty xbox and exchanged it, but found out on line that the game just does not work with the xbox."
3,An interesting old game,"The game is what one would expect of an older game.1: Graphics are not that great2: Game play is a lot tougher3: Loading takes awhileGraphics (C)At the time that this game came out, it might have been considered state of the art, but ,now, the movement is jerky and the characters look comical. No one should buy this game for its looks.Game play (A-)This game is tough. If you don't know how to play, then expect difficulty in the first couple levels. But because of its difficulty, it gives a great challenge. Players looking for some real competition should gives this game a try.Loading (C)I don't know if it's the game or my x-box 360, but it takes a little bit longer for the game to start then a regular game. It's not a long time, maybe 5 minutes, but it isn't how fast I would like my game to start up.Overall, I would give this game a C+ or a B-."
3,"Too many questions, just want to get to the game","I gave up after about 15 minutes of having to answer questions. I like a game that I can get in and play, this just took to long to set up."
2,Do not buy this game under any circumstance!,"There is absolutely nothing worse than spending 20 hours playing a game, then it freezes, and the only way to reboot is to turn off the machine and delete the corrupted save data. This actually happened to me on THREE occasions. Who wants to restart the same game over and over, and still not be able to finish it? The game itself is very deep and highly enjoyable, but it is also buggier than a Chinese restaurant. Without XBox Live support BethSoft can't release a patch like they did with the PC version. Buy it for your computer, but don't even look at the XBox version. It's cursed."
1,Worst Game Hyped!!!!,"I bought this game because of the reviews for it. I absolutely hate it!!!!! Dont get me wrong, I enjoy a good RPG but this one is bland on story and combat is terrible. My recommendation is not to buy this game, but if you are interested rent it first."
5,ALL TIME BEST,"This game is easily in the top five games of all time. I have never gotten as much playing time from any one game like a have for this one. I have a level 42 dark elf and i am currently working on my 2nd and 3rd characters. What makes this game so great is its wide open story line and open ended play. You can do anything from slaughtering every single orc that you come across in the game, to stealing a full suit of ebony armor from the Grand Duke of Vvardenfell. If you don't like this game than you should be wiped off of the face of this earth. If you love morrowind with all your heart then I.M. me on shutyomutha cuz you deserve my gratitude. If you need any help with the game or simply wanna talk about it also I.M. me cuz i am the ultimate morrowind guru. I love this game and so should anybody else with at least 3% of their brain working."
3,This game is the best game ever for like five months...,This game is a lot of fun for a long time but eventually you get bored of stealing houses and killing merchants so you do missions but then the missions make you run really far(although it would take no more than an hour to run all the way across the map even if you were almost completely burdened). I never even new you started losing stats at day 75 and that pisses me off so I probably am not going to play the game anymore because I hate feeling rushed. This game is the best game ever for like five months but I don't know if I will ever play it again.
1,It was fun while it worked.,"Unfortunately, that's not very long. A splendid game made all but unplayable by bugs and crashes. Get the PC version."
5,Morrowind: Outstanding!,"Morrowind is an epic, open-ended single-player game and is unique because it lets you create and play any kind of character you can imagine. There is 10 races 4(human), 3(elvin), and 3(beast). The Skills you choose for your character define your class which there is 21 of or you can even create your own class. Your actions in the game develops who and what your character is. Another good thing is no two sagas are the same in the world of Morrowind it has an infinite number of possible paths through the game. It's truly a well developed RPG!"
1,Boring and Damaging!,"The biggest problem with this game: it can create problems with your Xbox! Apparently, it saves progress in such a way that it can start to crash frequently. I've read some online stories of people who have had to have their Xbox repaired after using this, so be careful.The other downside is that it is just plain boring. You can walk and walk and walk with little action.In it's defense, it is the only game I've seen with such a big and open-ended world. There is simply a huge amount of terrain you can wander around, with a huge amount of freedom to do whatever you want (kill monsters, steal stuff, find food, buy things...)"
1,"Should be called ""SimWalk"" !","This game is for those who have scores of hours on their time.A ""massive world"" is not a beneficial feature! Think about it. Gameplay on this ""huge map"" equates to *endless* walking and stagnating boredom while you do. This game should be called ""SimWalk.""You will keep your character in fatigue inducing ""run"" mode the entire game. Even running you will groan watching the legs move in physically impossible slow motion. Can a game really claim 50+ hours of gameplay when 30 of those are spent walking?Someday designers should build on the principles of respected grandfathers of game design. One often quoted is Sid Meiers - ""If it isn't a fun feature - remove it.""Perhaps the Bard is more appropriate, ""My Kingdom for a horse!"""
4,From 16 Year Old in NY,"Well, first of all, before you buy this game you must have to like RPG's or do extreme research on what you really have to do in the game. The game in my opinion is the highest level of what you can do in an RPG. Your mission is to do whatever you want to. Don't get me wrong, there is a main plot and mandatory objectives to complete but there are sooooooo many more. You create your own character and choose you own profression and still join many guilds (special clubs) of different prospects. For instance, your profression could be a swordsman but secretly, you could join the thieves guild and do jobs for them. The world in which you play is enormous and the jobs are basically never-ending. This game will take you very long to complete but you wont get tired of it because there is always something else to do. For all you RPG lovers, this game is extremely good....the best example of what an RPG should be-total control. For the others, rent it first then buy it."
4,"WOW, ok?","WOW,ok? I kid you not my friends, this game is amazing. It gets off to a bit of a slow start, but then once you get into it, it is fun. The best part is customizing your character to make him the coolest and best he can be. This game is amazingly freeform and nonlinear, u dont have to follow the main story line. and also, be whatever you want, a brave adventuring hero, or a feared assassin, it doesnt matter. Make a life for yourself in Vvarfendel, wether it be as a freelance adventurer, or an agent of a guild, its your choice. So create a character, live out its life, and have a blast. Thats an order."
1,dont buy this game,i read all of thes reviews and i thought the game would be something like zelda boy was i rong this game is bad. its so boring and no fun i would tell evey one not to wast there money like i did trust me this game [stinks]!
1,A 1st person RPG?,"I love RPG actoin games like diablo, Dungeon siege & more. but that: i though i will realy love this game because from the screenshots i saw it looked like A 3rd person view, which is great! but then I lost 50$ for this 1st person game which you can't even change the view from 1st to 3rd. it's bad because: these games aren't fun if it's not a shooter and also you try to hit this little harmless worm and it almost kills you cause you miss it all the time just swinging your dagger. on normal RPG's you were just click it and it's dead. so: DON'T BUY IT! IT'S THE WORST. save your money for a better RPG like Diablo."
3,Can graphics beat gameplay? No,At least it has good graphics. That's right. They are amazing. Wonderful. Detailed. To bad the story and gameplay (are bad).
4,You definitely get your money worth with Elder Scrolls III Morrowind,"This is quite an interesting RPG. Although it does have some glitches, and if and when your character dies, it takes forever to reload; however, other than the mentioned issues, the game itself is worth the money I paid. It is hours of entertainment, and a game that unless you stay up for days, does not quickly come to an end."
4,Good But difficult,"I bought this game a couple of months ago and when I got it It was awesome ! Really Awesome! But it was a little difficult for me to accomplish all my tasks. I'm still working for Caius Casades on my first mission in the game as a matter of fact. I saw the review on a show called Toonami but the robot guy really underappreciated it. But that's not the point. Anyway, Like I said before it's a little hard for you to accomplish all your tasks. But it's got beautiful graphics, great music, awesome selection of characters, and a good fighting system. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because of the difficult tasks. But Then again it makes it more challenging. But I like things at a good challenge and not one that takes 10 months to accomplish.this review refers to the Platnium Hits edition."
3,"Good, but not great","Morrowind is a good game, dont get me wrong, but does not have what i takes to become one of the greats. The graphics are very poor for an X-Box game, and i would rate them more to PS2 or Dreamcast calibre. The enviroments are a bit bland and enemies are very sparce and a little unimaginative. Other than those quips, its a solid RPG. The level up system is done well, giving points to areas you use often. The battle system is a bit iffy, when in first person it can be a challenge to tell how far your blade or hammer will reach. A good game with some solid and enjoyable features, but some mediocre graphics that hardly live up to beauties like Halo and Dead or Alive 3. Because its the first RPG on the X-Box many will buy it whether its good or not, but if you have patience save your [money] and get Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republicor the much hyped Project Ego later this year."
2,Eh,"If your not a hardcore gaming nerd there's no point in buying this game. True the whole idea of building your character's life is truly quite amazing but the novelty wears off after awhile. Try renting it first and you'll see what I mean. However, like I said hardcore gamers and D&D type people will like it, but if your someone who likes to get thrown into the game A.S.A.P., save ur [money] for something like Bruce Lee's game."
2,Not a game for everyone.,"Rent this game before you buy it and make sure that it is your cup of tea...I enjoyed it at first but couldn't get anywere in the game even after a month of playing. I always felt lost both in the county and city. Also, the fighting is REALLY hard and you will die a lot. I did learn some good things like casting small spells that cost only 1 point everywhere to build experience. I am a RPG fan but this one is too difficult for me to get into. So, think about it first."
4,"OK, but PC version better","This game is good on xbox, as infinite in possibilities as everyone says it is. But, the pc version is overall a better deal (they are the same price). With the pc version you can download tons of expansions and modifications off the internet and it also has better graphics. I own both and would say go with the pc version on this."
4,Game,The graphics could be better but the story line I think is much better than the newer games like oblivian.
3,Morrowind,Works but whenever I try to load from the title screen the game crashes. Have to start a new game and load from there. Also the local map is usually completely black for some reason.
3,ultimate rpg,"this game has it's ups and downs. the ups are its massive worlds and vast storyline. the cons include its repetitiveness and have the potential to overwhelm users not used to rpgs. i consider this the mother of all rpgs because it is so massive. at first i was overwhelmed by its complexity that i had to back off from it for quite some time. i got back into it later, but i just don't have the 400 hours needed to finish the main plot. i suggest beginning with the dark alliance series and then d&d heroes before getting into this game. i applaud its complexity, though i need no life to play it."
1,Something you need to know!!!,Please be aware that this game is full of bugs. The game it self is good and addicting but it was not converted to XBOX system all that well. The game freezes and resets the further you get into it. If I could take it back I would!
5,WOW!,"This is an amazing game you can do everything. I think it even tops halo. To bad theres no multiplayer, but if they get it on the net morrowind would be insane. It has insane graphics, you ca become a mage, fighter, assaisian, or anything and choose from many types of races. It is a really awesome game and the world is soo fast its probaly the best rpg single player game since final fantasy 7, and i still can't get over the awesome graphics this is a must have game."
5,This game is the best game ever. A must for any Xbox owner.,I love this game!!! There is nothing not to like. It takes place in an almost endless world. The game is leniant that you don't even have to follow the main story if you don't want to.I would definetly give this game 6 out of 5 stars
5,Elder Scrolls 3: Morrowind,"Only one thing could EVER hurt the playability of this game: the longing for a real companion to join you in this massive world. Multiplayer, in either a split screen form or XBOX live is definitely needed, but that lack alone can't keep me from playing this game. It is seemingly neverending with its massive world, with more storylines and adventures than you can count. You can literally create any type of character you wish to, and do anything you want your character to do (within his/her capabilities; you can't levitate if you don't have that spell...). I myself have played through the game a few times now and have no desire to stop playing through the game. If you are into adventure or role-playing games, this is probably the ultimate."
2,Great Game!!!... Way too many bugs.,"I bought this game the day it came out as I was very anxious to purchase it in light of all the hype at the time. And the game is great at first. It seemed like the best game I ever purchased. However as you advance in the game and your levels increase your game save size also does too and once you got above 180 blocks per game save or so your game will start to lock up, give you dirty disk errors, and tons of other bugs that i dont even want to get into. Bethesda is currently claiming that it isn't a very popular problem and suggests in the meantime to try clearing the game cache (which doesn't work). It is of course though as you can see by many reviews here and tons of foroms elsewhere online that it is a very common problem and bethesda just dosn't want to face the expense of fixing it. I for one unless there tune changes will never buy another bethesda product and i suggest you all do the same."
4,Whats your bag?,"By all means, feel free to buy this game if you want to escape your own life and existence. This is the most in depth rpg I have ever played. Fortunately, I have a real life to live. Rent it first is my suggestion, then decide."
2,I'd rather watch paint dry.,"Yes, I've heard it all...An open-ended game (hooray)Hundreds of locations to explore in a huge world (whoopee)Be free to do whatever you want (yawn)If you have two or three months to kill, then this game is for you! If you love reading the same thing over and over and over again, this is your kind of game! If you like confusing melee controls and hours wandering aimlessly, BUY THIS GAME!If, However, you like a fast paced tightly designed game, I'd stay away from this title. Now, I grew up on D&D; and those types of games, so I'm no stranger to the RPG. But if I want to spend that much time playing a game, I'd rather do it with some friends and some beer, not sitting alone in a dark room interacting with boring characters and trying to pronounce the names of silly fictional villages.I know people who like this game, and to them I say, ""More power to you"". I'd rather watch paint dry..."
1,Don't buy this version,"FIrst off, the game itself is great, but not good enough to warrant purchasing the Xbox version, after hours of play the game will crash continually until the point you can't move through certain citys without it locking up and you havent to wait through extremely long load times to get back. Do yourslef a favor and pick up the pc version instead.This is not issue just experienced by me, apparantly the xbox runs out of memory and when loading a new area the game locks up taking forever, however if you don't beat everything and constantly make new characters you shouldn't run into problems.Play at your own risk."
3,PLEASE READ,"Hey, I just wanted to let people like me who love Xbox and want to get this game just because it is like the best game since Halo, but you want to reconisder. To truely enjoy the game, you have to be one hell of a RPG lover. I'm talkin those nerds who have no friends or put tape on their glasses to look cool. So just reconsider."
2,Bottom line,"I spent over an hour and killed two rats. Then, I popped Halo back in, and let the real carnage begin.Definitely an aquired taste. My guess is if you are on the chess team or the math team, you will like this game."
4,Amazing,"The pure scope of this game is amazing! You have a huge land to explore filled with tombs, caves, swamps, castles etc. In your travels you have the chance to obtain and master an enormous amount of weapons and magic spells. I have never played a game that is more all-encompassing or complex. Despite all this, I do have 2 criticisms.1. When you get killed it takes a looong time to upload a new game. If you are fighting a particularly tough character and get killed multiple times, this can get fairly old.2.Too much talking !! This game is a little too cerebral and a little low on action. You can spend hours just talking to the hundreds (if not thousands) of characters trying to gain information about your surroundings.If you like a game that requires strategy and patience this game if for you. If you like non-stop action you will find this game rather slow."
1,A good Intro to an actual book or CBT,"Although I did learn something from this incredibly short, very overpriced piece, I expect most other books on this subject offer the same information at the beginning and then go on to offer dozens of pages of substantial writing. I would strongly reccommend that buyers beware this CD."
2,Very Short,This computer based training CD is only good for a beginner. It covers the basics but does not go into much depth. The course is much too short it took me less than 30 minutes to complete it. In my humble opinion it is not worth the price that I payed.
1,Very Short,The material covered is easy to understand. But I covered the whole thing in a very short time. I think this 'book' is a bit short and in my opinion is not worth the price that I paid.
5,Very helpful,This is a very helpful book for those in the medical field especially Nuclear Medicine. It gives clear examples on how to work the problems and gives several test problems to practice.
2,"Might work for others, but not me.","I was hoping to get stronger reception of my wireless signal from my E3000 router. I did see a very slight increase, although it was so small as to be useless. Perhaps with a direct line-of-sight it might work better, but not through 2 walls in my house. I am using powerline adapters instead of wireless now - much more reliable and faster when a wired ethernet port can be used."
2,Bad instructional book,"I'm taking Paleobiostrat with a pretty well known and respected professor, and he loves the older edition of this book, absolutely hates the writing format of this new edition."
4,Excellent!!!!! Very informative to aspiring Paleontologists!,I thought this book was one of the best Dinosuar books I have ever read.......this book had lots of really neat info about the different kinds of dinosuars and how to be a paleontologist in your own time. I give this excellent dino book four stars!!!!
2,Book damaged upon arrival,"Ordered this textbook new, and it arrived with tears on the outside of the binding and edges of book is scratched and dented, to the point where the edges of the cover paper is splitting into two pages. I am very disappointed and have received used books in better quality."
4,For friend or reluctant newcomer,"Whether you are an expert in dealing with computers, or a reluctant newcomer who has been dragged kicking and screaming into the computer age, you are bound to relate to many of these short stories. Computer Legends, Lies and Lore runs the gambit from reality based computer incidents into the realm of science fiction. A variety of ideas and writing styles makes this a good choice for relaxing summer reading."
1,Lousy,"I got this book as a present from a relative who picked it off the 99 cent rack. It was not worth 99 cents. There are possibly one or two short stories in it which are worthwhile--it's not that they're downright bad, but it's just like reading a book of funny things that happened to someone's aunt or a book of urban legends or a book of short fanfics taken from random sources. None of them are really good, and none of them are really interesting, just a lot of surreal stories with nothing to really string them together."
1,Too much Alcohol mixed in with a little bit of fragrance,"Gave me a headache. I know its an EDT, but I've never seen any fragrance fade away so fast and smell like alcohol. I used this product several years ago when it came in the bottle that is pictured and this does not smell the same or last as long. Also, I did not know that it is NOT A SPRAY bottle. It is easy to tamper with and maybe I received a bottle of alcohol with 5% of the original perfume mixed in. Sample this before you buy."
2,3'X6' Pleated Full Fan Flag w/Stars(bunting),Disappointing. I thought they would be more sturdy & well-made than the ones you could buy at local retailers like Wal-Mart or Michaels. Instead it was exactly the same merchandise and it was almost $18 more expensive.
4,Nice Bunting,"This bunting looks great and seems very durable. It did arrive hideously wrinkled, but the wrinkles ironed out very easily and it fell into the nice pleats pictured. I've had them hanging from my front porch for about two weeks now over the Fourth of July holiday and despite the extreme weather/storms we've had, they still look great."
2,Web Design Studio Secrets,This is a good book for beginners to get some overall concepts formulated of what things are possible on the web and some good clues as to how to acheive that end. No real tutorials offered and you should have other texts or the web to glean that info...
2,"If you know any HTML, don't but this book","I wish that I had more carefully considered all these other opinions that suggest this book is not that good...because now I agree. On my best day I am barely an intermediate web designer and this book had not ONE secret to offer me. The Studio Secrets book it is for beginners only - the HTML is the same as any other beginner book, and the scripting samples you can pull off of virtually any web page."
4,Pretty nice slim case,"I was building a media center PC for my parents and so I looked around for a slim case that looks decent and doesn't cost too much. There didn't seem to be many choices around, but I'm glad I found this little gem. It's actually a bit longer than I thought, but it still would fit nicely on an entertainment shelf or even on the side. I also had to hunt down a slim profile video card and everything fits snuggly inside the case. The case is made of metal and is pretty sturdy. The only exception is that the front panel is made of plastic and feels a bit flimsy.I haven't seen many other MicroATX slim cases around, but I'm glad I found this one by Inwin. I hope they continue to make more of these with more improvements and even better designs."
5,Instant classic,"If there's any justice in the world, Brandtson will rise to the top of the emo-pop world with this release. Absolutely incredible. The band continues their progression into pop music, but still keeps their adventurous guitars and larger-than-life harmonies intact. These songs range from straight out hook-laden rockers to quirkier slow songs, and every single one of them is awesome. ""Cherokee Red"" has one of those hauntingly familiar melodies that never leaves. ""Guest List"" is fun and energetic, similar to something off of the band's last EP. Although this is obviously Brandtson, the pop influences are much more pronounced, and the album feels like something new and fresh. This is not a definitive album for the band, but it is certainly their best effort to date, and should get them the exposure they need to go down as one of the finest rock bands of our day."
2,really didn't see what all the fuss was about,"i listened to the CD after it was recommended to me and I really didn't find anything in it all-together profound or even musically desireful. again, this is just my taste. some may find his style to be very appealing."
2,Misleading Title and Art Work,"The title and painting on the cover are misleading as this is not a book about the Curtiss F9C-2 or the Macon's aircraft. It is a book about the Macon, people, blimps, the future of LTA etc. There are 9 photos of the author and only 11 of the F9C-2. The bibliography doesn't mention a single periodical and ignores the AAHS Journal (v3, n2) with 40 pages and 22 photos of the F9C-2."
2,This is NOT the Christian Band 'Philmore',"I bought this CD thinking it was by the Christian group Philmore. It is not. THIS Philmore cannot sing--he must have some very rich sponsor. The musicians on the album, however, are fantastic. I only wish I had an equilizer so I could take out the vocals. The only exception is Kyrie Elieson. There are some great kid choir vocals on that song."
2,Worth what you pay for it,"I wouldn't say this is a bad ring but it is worth what you pay for it. It definitely isn't as pretty as in the picture. I can clearly see where the sizing cut and weld was done. It also doesn't shine like it does in the picture. The one in the picture seems solid and pretty, the one I received was ehh okay. I probably could have gotten the same or better at a cheap jewelry store. There was some coating on it that turned my finger green the first few times I wore it. It seems to have worn off now but I just wish it was like the one in the picture. If you have money to waste, then go ahead and get it. Otherwise, I'd look around some more."
4,A disturbed romp through the mind of a perverted nerd,"Okay, I bought this movie having seen only one review at a 1 star, but I figure at eleven bucks for the Blu-Ray from Fry's, it's worth it just to see how bad it could be. I figure if I expected it to be awful, I'd be pleasantly surprised. I wasn't disappointed.Okay, so the main character is an incredibly twisted pervert of a nerd (and, really, almost all the major characters are perverts), but the story is pretty funny, assuming you're a geek or a nerd. That said, I'd caution that this is a very adult movie, and it might be a little too creepy for non-geek, non-nerd people. If the concept of someone engaging in... adult activity... with a computer grosses you out, don't watch this one."
3,historic film,"The movie was slow moving and kept repeating events and facts over when it was not necessary,,,unless you are forgetful. Did not care for the storyline."
2,Disappointing,"If this was the only existing record of Nilsson's singing you would wonder what all the fuss was about. The recorded sound is mediocre, failing to do justice to Strauss' beautiful score or the beauty of the singer's voice. In any case it doesn't matter much as Nilsson fails to get off the ground. Why put up with this dry fare when you can have Schwarzkopf, Janowitz, Meyer-Topsoe, Fleming and Mikolaj?Other items on the disc are songs of Sibelius, Grieg, de Frumerie, Rangstrom and Strauss. Nothing special. You're better off with Groop, von Otter, Stene and for the Strauss any of a dozen contemporay sopranos."
3,Seems a little weak,"I got this for my wifes urban cruiser (Navaro Fiona). It hand on teh wall just like my mountain and road bike racks but this seems to sag it bit more. I have had it for a over a year and the sag has nto gotten any worse but it still makes me uneasy especially when it is over my daughters beach cuiser. I got this rack because all the ones that have a hook shape at the end would not fit my wifes bike, this one is more angeled which was perfect."
4,Gets the job done,I was surprised by how well this works considering the price. I wasn't sure if it would work with my Vista 64 OS....but it does!! I'm using it for my wireless headphones....Bluetooth stereo audio.
3,great reference material,for the college student looking for the edge over their class mates. this is where you'll find all that great reference material
2,Worthless book good only for fire,"Maybe it was because of my college professor, but I could not stand this stuff! Most of it doesn't make sense and isn't really too useful. But there are probably worse math books."
5,Great book and in great shape. It's has been very helpful.,I wish all the books I have gotten from other companies were like this one. It has been so helpful. I really appreciate it. It is in great shape. Thank you so much.
1,don't drive and read this at the same time,"If you are sleep deprived, read this book. It is the cure all for lack of sleep. I don't think this author took Stats 101. I beg of you for the love of Allah, don't read this...."
3,headset telephone commentary,"I bought this headset for my husband for Xmas and he loved the concept. We are however, having one problem. My husband says that when he hits the mute button (when on conf. calls) it lowers the speech volume of the other party talking, thereby making it hard to hear what others are saying, & the volume up/down button does not remedy the problem! Othewise, we love the phone!"
3,It was ok.,I thought it was a cordless phone. You can only go a short distance with it. Thank you. Roman Orozco
4,Greatest phone I've ever owned!,"I purchased this phone in January of 1999 and it has worked really well. Phone calls are extremely clear and the headset is very lightweight. The only problem that I've had with it is a problem that is common with most headsets, the headset part wears out rather quickly and breaks. After about 2.5 years, it finally broke. I must admit, I have been rough on it a few times, but the design is still destined to break after a couple years of regular use. I am considering buying this again, but I would like a two-line phone with a few more features, so I am looking at some other phones by Plantronics."
3,Muted enthusiasm,"The headset itself is very comfortable. The sound when talking is fine. But the mute feature has two problems: 1. There is no way to tell when you are muted (no blinking light for example) except that the sound is much quieter. I have to toggle back and forth to check sometimes. 2. The sound while on mute is too quiet, sometimes it is impossible to hear the other party while on mute."
3,Hard to hear,"It was a lot more hard to hear through this headset than regular phones. Otherwise, everything else was fine."
3,Wish it had a time display,"Besides wishing for a wireless one, I also wish it had a display for time or duration. I haven't figured out the best position for the mike because it won't stay up as I want it."
1,Headphone telephone,"I am soooo disappointed in this headset. I was under the impression it was cordless and it is not.It is very cheap looking and cheaply made. I would like to return it, but I think I let too much time go by. It was too pricey too!"
2,Not Classic Styx,"I think that the original reviewer for this DVD who states that we are ""mercifully spared the songs by Dennis DeYoung""....""etc. is full of it. True Styx goes way back to the early 70's dude, and they did exist before Tommy Shaw and were pretty dang good back then too. DeYoung's songs on Mr. Roboto drove everyone away eventually, but dissing a total classic like ""Come Sail Away"" is downright rock travesty. Get your head on straight and watch the Styx ""Return to Paradise"" DVD and see the true Styx."
4,Great video!!!,It was so refreshing to watch this video. To see this classic rock band interact with kids is priceless. the look on their faces and getting into the music is inspiring. I wish more rock bands would do this before the age of Rock Music is gone. Thank you members of Styx and the CYO for doing this and sharing the experience with us all! I gave it a four star should be five but it would only get that if it was longer. Too bad they didn't do a small tour with this.
5,Fantastic,"If you're not Styx fan, you will be after watching this. The kids are great and should be proud of their orchestra and talents. The band shines and look like they had as much fun as the kids, not to mention the parents and relatives watching them."
5,Musical Magic,This is my pick as the finest rock concert I have ever seen. . Words just don't do it justice. It is a real happening. Pure musical magic.
4,Styx is a class act,"If you miss the quintet of Dennis, John, Chuck, Jy and Tommy, then this dvd won't quite make it. But, on the other hand, if you are a Styx fan, then you are going to enjoy the show. I recommend this to all, young and old...my ten year old loved it!Hats off to the Contemporary Youth Orchestra, besides being a group of young talented individuals, they look like they are having the time of their lives. The band members also look like they are having lots of fun and that makes all the difference. This show is not a ""staged performance"" for the camera as I've watched Styx live several times and they always sound great and look like they are having a great time.The song selection is good, but I miss not watching Dennis sing the songs that helped make Styx a great band. Enjoy!"
3,Styx & the Contemporary Youth Orchestra of Cleveland Blu Ray,"The Concert is recorded well, picture and sound very good quality. I went to play the Bonus songs which are holiday music come out muffled."
5,Styx and CYOC,Amazing blending of 1980's rock and symphony orchestra Lisa rocks! The joy on the faces of the orchestra and choir members is infectuous as they play and support musicians who were writing this music years before they were born.
4,"Good purchase, great concert!!","I saw this concert on a cable station & had to have it on DVD. Lots of great songs on here, but the performance being with a very talented & enthusiastic youth orchestra really made the show."
5,Made me fall in love with Styx,"Actually, I accidently found this video playing on a cable music channel one day and immediately fell in love with it... and with Styx. I am a child of the 60's and knew some of the Styx music, but I had no idea just how versatile and talented this group has been and remains, even through all it's incarnations over the years.This particular video stands out because of the collaboration with the Contermporary Youth Orchestra and Chorus of Cleveland, OH, under the leadership of Lisa Grossman. The Styx music is wonderful, melodic stuff, but the real joy of this video is watching these talented young people as they strut their stuff with the band and show the love of music on their faces and with their enthusiastic movement.It is a joy to watch even if you are not already a Styx fan. But, I warn you, you may LOVE Styx after watching this DVD."
5,One With Everything Styx and the CYO,"Styx and the Contemporary Youth Orchestra and Chorus form an awesome musical event. Hear Styx songs as never before, and a few new ones too. It's a musical jam with a classical twist. A perfect choice made by Styx."
4,Great Read!!,The story line is captivating and the fact that all of the characters you know and love are brought togther in such new and unique juxtapositions makes this worth recognition.
3,D'Israeli should stick to what he does best......Rugrat comic strip,"Seeing Batman being drawn in such a pathetic cartoonish way as shown in the Bread and Circuses part of this series just hurt my eyes. I've seen much much better comic art drawn by an amateur comic artist.Batman Mosaic is also a pain for my eyes. It might be just me, but I don't like gothic drawing that much, especially when the style is applied to every single characters in the comic.If your comic style is to read comic with the all the characters having bad teeth gothic style, then this part is for you, otherwise you'll feel the same way I do.The only reason that I didn't give one star for this part of no man's land is because the later half part of this GN is very well drawn. Especially the ones drawn by Phil Winslade and Mike Deodato.The story is pretty good, but I really am dissapointed by DC's choice with the first half part of this GN."
5,excellent read,it was everything i was looking for in a graphic novel the action was nonstop batman is our favorite comic book character there were many interesting points in the story
5,Love it!!,This book was in perfect condition. I bought this for my boyfriend and when I opened it in the mail I was very happy with the quality the book was in. It was spotless and smelled brand spanking new. I was not expecting this to come until next week but I am VERY happy that it came today. SUPER FAST SHIPPING from Greg Rucka. Thank you so much for completing my Christmas gift list and my boyfriends Batman comic collection. XOXO
5,Magnify - the new testament biblezine,"As a children's pastor, I highly recommend the Magnify - New Testament. It's interactive layout is perfect for this next generation. Before we can expect a child to hold the truths found in the scriptures, they first must understand and interact with the scriptures in a way that creates ownership. Magnify is a great tool to accomplish this."
4,great bible for kids,"My girls love this bible, they can take it anywhere. They love the additional activities too."
2,"Original format, but hellfire tone in the add-ons","As intriguing and as eye-candy fetching as the format is, I can't recommend this edition of the New Testament, nor could I drive myself to buy it for my kid. The tone of the commentary and side-bars is so blatantly evangelical that a child is likely to think that most of his classmates (kids aged 7-11!) are on the path to hell, plus we all need to get out there and convert the whole wide world, without any respect whatsoever for the complex cultures and belief systems found on this wonderful planet. My kid MIGHT be inclined to tune into this edition, once he gets old enough -- but I'm not ready to abandon him to Pat Robertson's interpretation of Christianity quite yet. (No, as far as I know, Robertson is not involved with this publication. But you get the idea.)"
1,Book Review,"This book was not too informative. It brushes the top of issues, and provides tips on aspects of selling that are a given for most salesmen."
3,I have used better,"I installed this in my garage with ease. I have only used it a couple of times so far, but when it is reeling itself in, it tends to bunch up and get jammed. I haven't had a chance to play with it a bit to see if this is fixable, but I will update if it is.Over all it is still better than doing it by hand, but there are better quality products out there if you want to save some frustration."
5,Air Hose Reel,"My son asked for this as a Christmas present. He reports that it was easy to install, is heavy duty, and exactly what he was expecting for quality and durability. The company shipped it promptly."
4,Its the small things that make the difference,"It is a great reel and does what it is supposed to do very well, it arrived ahead of the projected delivery so over the moon at that.As other people have pointed out the reel supply hose is too short to be of any use in the ""real"" world, its the small things which make something outstanding and this is one of those small things that lets the product down. I have to ask if the suppliers ever read the comments made on these sites, sure doesn`t look like it."
2,Beware of what you are looking for,"I purchased this product based on the picture provided (I was looking for the loudest available handheld airhorn)However, the product I received was different, it was the same design as the ones sold at Academy or WalmartYankee Warehouse Inc BH1201C ""Blazer"" the Blaster Air Horn - 8 Ozwith the I guess self-contained horn if that makes any sense. This contrary to the composed design of the horn pictured that has a tube that attaches to the can and then goes parallel to the horn and into the rear pressure chamber."
5,Excellent 2.5mm Headphone Set,"Works very well. Can hear & be heard. Not perfect volume control, but excellent for the price."
2,Three strikes,"I had it for a week before a part broke off and it would not stay on my head anymore. I returned it & got another one. The new one, less than a year old by now, just broke too. The headphone pad snapped off. I don't use it roughly either. I had another model from Plantronics before, and that one broke too. Maybe I just have bad luck - but I am not buying another Plantronics headset. Why did I keep buying them? They look nicer than the other brands and the sound quality was pretty good. So I liked it but the quality is not so good."
2,Sounds good but .......,"Well, this headset was great for a while...until one day I couldn't hear anything on the phone without it. I realized that the pin had broken in my phone. Ok, things happen. I phoned plantronics and then sent me a new one. THey said it happens sometimes, but not often. THEN it happened again and this time we coundn't get the pin out of the phone. I had to pay 60 dollars from verizon to fix the darn thing. I phone plantronics again. They said that I should have sent my phone to them to fix for free. YEah, OK and not have my phone for 3 weeks with all the shipping. Give me a break. After all my complaining, they did send me a check, and a new headset that I wouldn't use, because of the fear of it happening again. the whole thing was just a hassle. I guess all and all they accomodated me, but not without a hassle"
2,Feels very flimsy,"I don't think this will last very long. I was thinking of deploying this in a call center environment, but I don't think it would last very long. Plus, the cord is too short for desktop use."
4,They're Greatttttttt!!!!,"I had this Plantronics headset before but paid $30.00 for it. Like all products eventually it died so the search was on for another pair. Not wanting to pay the same price again I searched here on Amazon and to my surprise they sold them for $9.99! I brought 3 pair. I simply love these headsets. The sound is great and the fit is comfortable. The only thing missing is a volume control/mute button. However, I can live without it. Truly a great buy saving me more than half of what I would have paid in a store."
1,Avoid This,"The other reviewers are correct: This is an inferior product. The microphone makes you sound (to the person on the other end) as if your mouth is facing away from it. Long distance NEVER sounded so long distance, as it does with this product.Plantronics prides itself on being the premiere headset/mic company: makes one wonder why they didn't do quality tests on this junk.I'll be returning this product for a refund."
1,Not Happy,"Doesn't work with Nokia 6500 series.Great price, however is not compatible with ""all phones having a 2.5 MM plug"""
4,"cell phone head set, plantonics","i like the over the head band, so far it is working just fine. i like it very much. shirlee larotonda"
1,Great Product Until It Fell Apart...,"After several months, the headset started to fall apart. The microphone stick broke and the headset plastic horizontal part kept coming loose. Plantronics is an excellent headset brandname, but somehow this product is not a heavy-duty headset. You have to be very gentle when storing it away."
2,It's difficult to hear me,I'm on conference calls almost daily. Since I got this headset everybody is complaining that they can't hear me.The microphone position has to be adjusted just right or I'm hard to understand.I'm looking for a replacement.
2,Lacks adjustable microphone,Sound quality is excellent but microphone is too far from mouth to be effective. I have to hold it to get it close enough so others can hear my voice. I'm taking it back.
3,"Big and buzzy, but okay","Well, it doesn't fit into my purse very well and there's a weird buzz that doesn't go away and seems to really bug the people I'm talking to, but I like the way it fits on my head and it doesn't fall off like earbuds always do.I have a feeling that there's better headsets out there, but this one is inexpensive and does what I want it to--talk hands-free without any problems hearing or being heard. The buzz is annoying but bearable."
3,No such thing as a slow headset,"The person above who wrote of this headset being slow has confused Internet telphony performance with headset characteristics. Internet telephony is slow and erratic regardless of headset choice. BTW, you get what you pay for...if you want an inexpensive headset, this is as good as any in its price range."
4,A Very Decent Headset,"I actually originally bought this for my cell phone (a Nokia) however for some reason it was not compatible with it and didn't work (so take that as a warning to all you folks with a Nokia). However, instead of returning it, I decided to test it out on my home phone and it worked great! The ONLY negative thing I can really think of to say about it is that this headset is definitely made for people with smaller heads. If your head is anywhere on the bigger side than it may be a little small for you. But as far as sound quality if concerned, you hear everything crystal clear and it is very durable (at least compared to other headsets I've bought in the past). Definitely a good purchase!"
2,Hard to find a good headset,"I've tried and returned at least 5 headsets ranging from $15 to $150. This one was typical of the others that I returned, low volume on the earpiece and low quality microphone. I finally ended up with a Panasonic TCA60 for about $19 which is very loud and sounds great on both ends. It's nothing fancy, no volume control and no mute, but who needs that when you can accomplish the same thing with your phone. Price does not determine sound quality. I recommend this product."
2,Good sound -- worthless mic,"I was very disappointed by Plantronics dropping the ball on this one. I spend an average of 5-6 hours a day on the phone and enjoyed the M175. Apparently, someone else did also, and I had to get a replacement. Figured the same thing as someone else here and I would save myself $15 and step down.Headset and earpiece comfort were comparable, as was sound quality (reception). I get so many complaints on the mouthpiece, that I have given it up and am switching back.Either the mic is poor, or the positioning is bad. I have a small face, and even so, I wish the boom mic was longer and didn't stop at the corner of my mouth.Bottom line -- unless your mouth curves to one side or you like bending the mic to your mouth, skip this one."
2,Poor sound quality,Although the unit appeared well built and sturdy the sound quality from the earpiece was very poor. I experienced a muffled and crackly sound. I sent it back.
2,Low Quality Sound with this one,"I have always had a tough time finding a headset that worked well. I purchased three (this one, a Uniden 'behind the ear' model and a Panasonic KX-TCA60) to replace the Plantronics headset that broke, after 8 months of use. I called my son (out of state) and asked him to judge the sound quality of all three.The Plantronics had the worst sound quality by far. It was so bad that I threw it away. (Good comfort factor, though.)The Uniden had the highest sound quality and by far the lowest comfort. It was very poorly constructed, and hurt my ear at the spot the plastic head band rested on it. I am keeping it as a back up.The Panasonic was well constructed, and had a sound quality that was only slightly lower than the Uniden, but the comfort factor was very high, so it is now the one I use daily."
1,Didn't last long...,"I bought this mid Oct 2005 and it has died. It only lasted 3 months, give or take.I do not recommend it."
2,Yuck!,This item is so terrible. All it could do was be a telephone and it wasn't even that great. On my computer it was so slow. It took almost 10 seconds for the person could hear you or vis versa. The microphone didn't even work. It didn't have an on switch. (Always get something with an on and off switch.)
4,Satisfied,"Works with Motorola C261 and C139. The padding on the earpiece is more comfortable than the run of the mill stuff I've seen in other products. The cord is thin(like most products these days), but has held up so far."
4,Review Plantronics M110 Headset,Excellent Headset. Very inexpensive and top of the line quality and sound clarity. Best I have used for the cost in 6 years of heavy telephone usage.
2,Limited Life,They work good while they last. I am looking to buy my third one. I guess for the price that makes them OK.
3,it works...,"As with all of these global global market imports the quality is cheap. If you need the item...you need it and if that's all that is available, that's what you have to choose from. This one worked. We lucked out. We reinforced weak points to improve the likelyhood of their not self distructing when needed the most. Good Luck."
1,Plantronics M110 Bluetooth Over the head set,I was severely disappointed. It was the most pricey headset I ordered and it did not work. No one could hear me and I could barely hear them. I will not buy anything with the name Plantronics again.
2,best value till it went bad in 3 months,"I use this daily and the wire (inside not visible) is making intermittent contact so the callers voice cuts in and out. It only lasted 3 months so though I liked it very much for the price it isn't durable, and if it can't be used then what is it worth really? initial impressions can be deceiving."
1,Are you on your headset again???,"Bought this because of the price, and it seemed like a good value besides. But a total disappointment. Everyone complains they can't hear me well. I've tried every position with relation to my face and mouth, all three mic settings. Nothing helps. My friends on the other line identify the device right away (""Get off your headset!""), strangers complain I'm speaking too softly. Shouting only causes distortion. What a waste."
1,Great if you don't mind not being heard,"This headset was comfortable to wear, but people couldn't hear anything I was saying-- horrible microphone. I went out and bought a generic General Electric phone headset for 11.99 & am completely satified-- flexible microphone, great sound quality, mute button, volume control."
1,Worst performance I've ever seen.,"I bought two of these headsets to be used on cordless telephones. Tried them on 2 different brand handsets (AT&T, Uniden). The problem is not the nice fit on your head, nor the excellent audio in the earphone. The problem is the microphone! Irregardless of the microphone 'volume' setting on the jack, no one can hear you very well even when speaking considerably louder than normal. I'd really look elsewhere for a headset as these just aren't worth even the low price at Amazon."
2,good except for the microphone,"The only problem with this headset is that people you are talking to will have trouble hearing you. This is pretty important to me, so I only give it 2 stars. I have used it extensively with both my cell phone and my cordless phones at home with the same problem."
4,Essential reference material,"This book is essential material for someone interested in knowing how NT really works. I discovered it a few years ago, and it immediately freed me from having to peer through a kernel debugger, darkly, trying to figure out interfaces.To my mind, the amount of information is right. I don't need tutorial information. I don't need a repeat of what is in, say, 'Inside Windows 2000'. This book is refreshing in that it tacitly assumes the existence of the intelligent reader.Though this book does not focus on kernel programming, quite likely you're going to be a kernel weenie if you're even interested in the material.I don't even find the book physically too small. It's a lot easier to read, physically, than those 'inside secrets of the gurus in 21 days' tombstones."
3,When I got it it was broken,"I bought this tank for my dad. He's in his 80ies! However, What better than a tank. When I received it one of the outside wheels was broken. Also, the screw that holds the right front drive wheel was not installed so the tread came off. I contacted the seller and they sent me a replacement wheel immediately. When we tried it out on Christmas everything worked except the gun. It wouldn't shoot. Bummer. The engineering and attention to detail seems to be great but the quality control in manufacturing is not. Odds of getting a defective one is probably high."
5,movie the best.,"I love this movie, and looked every where for it my daughter found it here, i'am so happy I got it now I can watch it when every I like. thank you. Mrs.D"
4,Better in retrospect,"It was okay; I read the book first and liked it better, but after watching this film the first time and waiting a while, I appreciated it more. I didn't like the character of Lord Melbourne and wonder how inaccurate much of his portrayal is. It did make me think about how corrupt politics are, though! Generally, this is an entertaining and enjoyable film and perhaps not to be taken TOO seriously."
5,The Young Victoria(Blue-ray),This is a very touching and loving movie and the story line is wonderful and the music is great too.
4,A lavish love story that held my interest throughout,"This 2009 film is based on the early years of Queen Victoria's reign, one in which the young queen, played by Emily Blunt, has to deal with the complex politics of the throne and also falls in love. Basically, this film is a love story between the Queen and Prince Albert who reigned together for 20 years and had nine children before his untimely death. She actually reigned for 63 years which I learned later from doing a little research on the internet.The film itself is rather slow moving and predictable. However, I didn't care. I loved the costumes and the pageantry and atmosphere of privilege and royalty. The young Victoria was pretty and rather innocent of the ways of politics but she learned quickly enough. And it's nice to see a royal couple who actually seem to be in love with each other. I don't know enough about British history to critique the authenticity of this film. To me it was a lavish love story that held my interest throughout."
5,"Great as drama, okay as history","I saw this film on a whim and am very glad I did. I hadn't read anything about Victoria before and knew nothing of her early life. This film seems to capture the basic outlines in a responsible and dramatically interesting fashion. The costumes, acting, etc are excellent. The script is fine. Some liberties were taken with history for dramatic effect. For example, Lord Melbourne is played as someone in his 30s, when in fact he was in his late 50s when Victoria became queen. There is a strong dramatic element of implied sexual competition between Melbourne and the king that I suspect was absent in real life. No real disappointments here. If you think you may like it, you won't be disappointed."
3,"Emily Blunt shines, as usual...","Emily Blunt currently is my absolutely favorite actress. I would not miss any movie in which she appears.I particularly liked her in ""Dan In Real Life,"" however, she's always a joy to watch. She has a witty and eroticpersona that makes her brainy and seductive. As lovely as she was in ""Young Victoria,"" she really didn't geta chance to work to her full potential. I found the film beautiful to look at but for the most part ratherdull. Also: Sarah Ferguson talks about the fact that the love affair between the youthful Victoria and her consort, Albert, isrelatively unknown, but I've known about their mutual admiration since I was a child. There was a bust of Queen Victoria on our grandmother's mantel piece because she was an avid fan of the beloved monarch. She told us many times the story of the romantic and working partnership of V & A. Anyway, this film is a pretty attempt, but as a truly in-depth drama - a lesser work."
5,Young Victoria,"Even though some of the historical events are questionable the movie is wonderful.Both Blunt and Friend are totally enjoyable to watch. Highly recommend. Notnecessarily a ""chick flick""....but could be. Lindy Friedman"
5,DVD,I found this to be a very entertaining view of Queen Victoria. Most of us are familiar with her later years.
5,DELIGHTFUL !,WONDERFUL LOVE STORY ! IT WAS SO GOOD I WATCHED IT A SECOND TIME TO UNDERSTAND ALL THE FLASHBACKS. THEY DON'T MAKE MOVIES LIKE THIS VERY OFTEN .
5,Young Victoria,"An excelent film of Vjctoria aqnd Albert and theirb importance in Britis History ande that impact in the world. they gave aq vision of are the rights of laborrers. A vision for educarion and thev equality of all people- housing, medical care, working condition. A five vstar film and cast,"
3,Uninspired,"I wanted to see this because I really like Emily Blunt. She does a nice job with what she has to work with, but the script and directing we're ho-hum."
5,Loved It!,"How did I miss this when it originally came out? After watching it, I went off in search of the back-story; spent hours reading Wikipedia and other sites and ordered Weintraub's bio of Prince Albert (which I just finished). Found the movie to be mostly faithful to the ""big picture"" truths of history, and found that ""the rest of the story"" (to quote Paul Harvey) even more amazing than the movie. Just goes to show that real life is a whole lot more interesting than what people can make up. Fabulous music, too! (And this Blu-ray is amazingly clear!)"
2,Historically Inaccurate,"The actress portraying the 18 year old Queen looked as if she were in her 30s, Lord Melbourne (a true gentleman who loved Victoria as a daughter) was depicted as a satyr, I kept waiting for King William to hiss 'My Precious', Albert, an extremely intelligent, studious and dignified individual from his youth came off as weak and subservient, and a ridiculous, untrue liberal socialist agenda was attributed to Queen Victoria's reign. The only positive comment I can offer is for the costumes and sets. A much better production on Queen Victoria and Prince Albert is 'Victoria and Albert', you just have to ignore that the actor playing Albert has an English accent instead of German."
3,Lover of History,This movie gives you an insight to Victoria's life before she became queen. I highly recommend it to those of us that are interested in European History. It also gives anyone a feel of life for royalty.
2,The Young Victoria - blue-ray,"The movieIQ and the BD Live features, which is the reason I purchased the blue ray edition, DON'T WORK.Extremely irritating to purchase a product and discover the extra features don't work."
2,Disappointing,"This movie was not at all what I expected. It was short in duration, left many important parts of Victoria's life dangling. The costumes were however, very nicely done."
3,"3 stars for the blu-ray dvd.. BUT, 5 STARS for the movie...","love the movie, therefore bot the blu-ray version. the download of this blu-ray is long... in our sony blu-ray player. also surprise to find static-stop movement during the movie. will call amazon to report on this cliche."
5,An Up and Coming Classic To Be,"This movie was listed in my recommendations list. I hadn't heard of it before, but saw that Emily Blunt played the lead character. After reading the reviews and seeing the pictures I had to order it. I am so pleased with this movie. The characters, costumes, and settings made me feel as if I were really watching Queen Victoria in the flesh. I was just mesmerized. It was a beautiful story of determination and love. I highly recommend this movie!"
5,One of My Personal Favorite Movies,"Great cinamatography, great costumes, great music, great mood, touching story, and excellent acting. All the more pleasing because it is mostly true. I could watch it over and over again."
4,"Excellent storytelling and and acting, also quite compelling","The Young Victoria tells the story of Queen Victoria in the first years of her reign and just before she took the throne. This is a unique vantage point as many past stories have focused on her as an older woman, mourning the loss of Prince Albert. While this is primarily a love story, it shows how both Victoria and Albert became lovers as well as co-rulers of Great Britain.Granted this is not designed to be a documentary, such events as Albert being shot by a would be assassin never actually happened, but what is important is that the relationship between Victoria and Albert became one of true partnership and the closeness the two felt for each other becomes obvious and makes the pain felt in some films such as Mrs. Brown seem so much stronger.This is a very good movie. It features great acting, wonderful writing and a true understanding of what life was like for Victoria growing up. I would strongly recommend this to anyone."
5,great movie,"This is one of our family favorites. It is well done and the characters are well developed. The only thing I think that could be improved is the font size of the words on the screen. They are too small to see and you have to see them to get the full affect of the story. But we loved the movie, bought several to use as gifts"
4,Emily is splendid,I have followed Emily Blunt over the years. She has been very good in a variety of different roles from the bored teen-aged seductress of a village girl (My Summer of Love) to an embattled daughter (Gideon's Daughter) to the upstaged assistant to the great Miranda (The Devil wears Prada) to the irresponsible sister to Amy Adams (Sunshine Cleaning). In all of these movies she catches your attention. Now she stars in this major movie. She absolutely shines as the young Queen Victoria. I believed her portrayal. I was captivated. The costumes were beautiful. She looked beautiful. Emily Blunt makes the movie. She made it very good indeed.
5,Great Romance,What a beautiful story of love and romance. After the first time I saw this movie I couldn't wait to see it again. This is one I will watch over and over for years.
5,What a Love Story,Emily Blunt was so remarkable in the Devil Wears Prada. She surpasses that wonderful performance with her work in Young Victoria. I collect the movies that I like. This one is obviously going onto my list of favorites.
5,Amazing!,I am a huge history fan and love period films. My favorites are usually set during Victorian age and Edwardian age. Emily Blunt gives a wonderful performance as Queen Victoria. The story tells of Her Majesty growing up and falling in love. Fabulous!
4,Historical Romance,"When most people think of Queen Victoria, they probably think a fat little prudish woman. That was certainly her image as she got on in years but by focusing this on when she is a young woman (and played by the beautiful, slim Emily Blunt) she definitely has more appeal to audiences. The movie is gorgeous, beautifully acted (loved Mark Strong as Sir John Conroy. He's much better playing villains like this and Lord Blackwood in Sherlock Holmes), and really romantic. As a historical work alone it's probably not the best but as a historical romance it's great! The costumes are all really eye-catching. I was surprised at how much I liked them! It's my least favorite era in fashion history and most of Victoria's gowns are borderline gaudy (she is the queen after all!), yet the costume designer and Emily Blunt managed to make them work."
5,5 stars - very watchable,"Hey whiners - where's perfection. We lived in London for 2 years - went to the V&A Museum several times - never learned about the history behind the edifice - our fault but we were only 23 and from the ""colonies"". This was 5 stars - we'll watch it again."
5,Beautiful!,"I thought this was a beautifully filmed and acted movie. The beginning is a little confusing if you're not aware of all the details; my husband and I had to rewind the dvd several times in the first 10 minutes or so until we were sure of what exactly was happening, but after that it was marvelous."
2,Sunsout Jigsaw Puzzle,"I found this puzzle impossible and frustrating. It's pieces overlap other pieces instead of matching the piece next to it or below/on top of it. I don't know if all Sunsout puzzles are the same, but there is no description on the package saying that the puzzle is one with non-matching pieces.Unless you enjoy trying every piece of the same color without any sense of matching it, I don't recommend this puzzle.Cathy"
5,Great Tales,"I really enjoyed this book. If it wasn't a biography then it would be a great novel. Covers Lightoller's life from a young deckhand, thru multiple shipwrecks including the Titanic and later life to the end of WW2.This isn't a book just about the Titanic. That is only covered in one section of the book. So if you're looking for a purely Titanic book this isn't it.If you like sea adventures then this is great reading. Perhaps more of a guy's book in that respect."
5,Great Read,Whispers of Insanity draws you personally into the lives of the very real characters with lots of descriptive writing. This thrilling and intriguing murder/ghost story is easy to read and hard to put down. I loved it! I can't wait for T C McMullen's next book.
3,An Italian 'Repulsion',without the murder. Striking images in an usual setting. Interesting to note the dates of the Antonioni and Polanski films. Female neuroticism was quite the rage.
3,Antonioni's first color film is one of his best.,"This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.Red Desert (Il deserto rosso) depicts an Italian factory during a strike and the factory's manager whose wife was just released from a hospital. The manager, Ugo's, friend Zeller (Richard Harris), offers a business deal which may help them out.The DVD includes audio commentary by David Forgacs, archival interviews with cast and crew, two short documentaries by Antonioni, ""Gente del Po"", about the Po River, and N.U. about city street cleaning, a theatrical trailer and dailies from the production."
2,Foreign in Everyway,"Well the only thing red in the movie is the woman's hair, she is mentally sick after being in an accident, her husband and his friend are industrialists, the friend (Richard Harris) of course wants his wife even though she is sick so a lot of the story is his pursuit of his best friend's wife, WOW, that something new and boring as crap! I like the industrial settings, they remind me of Pasolina's poverta films, but I think the scenes would have been better in B&W. I do see how his use of color enriches her beauty but the entire thing is almost surreal and I got tired of the length and dialogue. The actress might have won a prize for acting as she was constantly becoming spaced out but a little over the top with the melodrama. I would give it a 5 out of 10 and that's being generous. The backgrounds have a surreal feel much like a De Chirico or Magritte painting which might appeal to an artist otherwise not much attention need for this film."
2,Pink Sunset,"This early-Sixties artiness, this 50 year-old angst, seem absurd now. They always were, of course, but it took the passage of time to make that manifest. Still, the film is lovely to look at, and its very earnestness can make one wax nostalgic. There was indeed a time when movies took themselves seriously, and were taken seriously by others. That time will not come again, and shouldn't (the whole medium is irredeemably shallow, a play of surfaces or ""moving pictures""), but it can be pleasant, if bittersweet, to reminisce."
2,Defective DVD received.,"Bought this in supposedly ""Like New"" condition, but DVD arrived with 4 scratches on it, and the movie freezes and starts over from the beginning every time. Very disappointed."
3,Social Deviants - 'Garbage' (Total Energy),"I simply don't understand what the point of releasing this four song EP,which has just the very same track listing as the Deviant's(let's drop the 'Social' here)very first album,'Ptooff'(see my review)minus three cuts,which are their flower child ballad ""Child In The Sky"",""Charlie"" and the instrumental ""Bun"".Could someone PLEASE explain this to me?Strictly for Deviants completists."
4,A great program even for the total beginner,"Without having a lot of experience with either 'real life' chess or chess programs,I still can say that this is a great choice for anyone interested in getting started and learning the game - even if you've never played chess in your life.The beginner tutorials walk you through everything you need to know about the basics, and it's worth noting that they have a very good kid's program as part of the package.Especially helpful is the ability to choose what kind of 'personality' you are playing against. This lets you build up your skills and confidence without getting crushed by a grandmaster every time - the first personality I played against was a beginner too. But it's a good program for the seasoned player as well: my dad, a real pro, was well challenged by the high-rated personalities.The only drawback are some of the other features like the library, as it's hard to figure out how to view classic games. But for basic learning this program is a winner."
5,Autumn Hearts a new beginning,"An extraordinary cast conveys this powerful and emotional story of Holocaust survivers reuniting at a picturesque Quebec farm. The inevitable emotional baggage and long forgotten feelings effect each character differently. Christopher Plummer, Max von Sydow, Susan Sarandon, and Gabriel Byrne give powerful performances. Roy Dupuis reveals the depth of his acting tallants. A great cast, beautiful scenery, and emotions make this ""great story telling"" movie a must see."
2,Slow movie. Don't expect too much excitement.,"Gives an interesting viewpoint of victims of the holocaust. However, the movie is not all too exciting. I think I would prefer to read the book on a lazy afternoon."
3,creatures 3,Very fast response and fast delivery unfortunatly it takes a bit to get used to the game and the way it works as it doesnt come with the cd booklet. contemplating tyring to find a user guide. =-) Great Seller though!
4,Great upgrade over the orginal - but one problem,"I bought this game for a friend and had many chances to play with it before I wrote this review. The game is much more stable, the environment is more self-sufficent, and the norns are very intelligent. There are many more things to tweak and play with in the world, and the environment is bigger. The one problem is, after you set up the environment and connect technology, the world becomes self-sufficent, thus leaving you to sit there and watch until something major happens. Good for the average user, but if you enjoy building COBs, altering genomes (the world is, as I said, self-sufficent), et cetera, I would wait off."
5,Going Bridal Rocks!,"Loved this book -- it's hilarious, and helpful. Much more ""real"" than most wedding books. And great to read something that focuses on the emotional side of wedding planning. Each chapter opens with a short, funny fictional story of one bride who doesn't want to get caught up in wedding madness, and then moves on to real life examples of some of the potential landmines -- family, friends, the vendors, even old ""whatsisname."" Very entertaining, great way to take your mind off wedding stress. I'd give it to any friend planning to get married."
2,Let me out of here,"OK, I'll be honest here - I'm a man and so perhaps completely unqualified to comment on this book. But my fiancée agrees with me that The Rules are a load of rubbish, so I feel emboldened.... I'm afraid that I can't take any book seriously that is written entirely in Cosmo-style gush (e.g. p1: 'I have three, count 'em, three friends getting married this year'). Sure, write a little magazine article like this, but a whole book? My skin started crawling after a few paragraphs. I'd have given it one star but I feel I should be open-minded enough to allow that Cosmo might have SOME value hidden to my masculine brain."
1,Dont buy,"Dont waste your money on this book,seriously. The only thing you need to know is Parasites. Yes, doctors dont want you to know about it, kind of obvious isnt it. Read educate yourself. Go to the web and search and find the best parasite cleanse called Dr. nature colonex. You wont be sorry, you will be amazed, and hopefully it will help you and your loved ones. Dont believe me , educate yourself."
1,i want my money back!,"I wish i had read the reviews on the CD before purchasing this DVD...the host is terrible, and it is a rip off with very little info --- Eric is an amazing human and i am surprised he agreed to do this...it is not worth the shipping cost to watch..."
2,Just an Interview,".... Took too long time to send this to Norway and when I got it, it was just an interview, little to learn, little to know.Way to Expensive for what I got out of the Dvd.Ok quality.Regards from JanO"
4,Enjoyable Introduction,"Far from a weighty professorial exposition, The Making of Britain: The Middle Ages presents a series of essays by British Lecturers on a wide array of medieval topics, including the church, the manor, Parliament, and town life.Every essay is lucidly written and accompanied by illustrations that truly do illustrate the text, greatly enhancing the enjoyment of the book. Each essay does a fantastic job of showing the evolution of Britain (primarily, England and Scotland) into its modern form. For those who already have extensive knowledge of British history, there probably is not much here for you. For the rest of us who have an interest but little actual knowledge, The Making of Britain: The Middle Ages is made to order."
2,smaller than you think,"Great sunglasses just not the style for me...small, seemed like my head was being squeezed. I suggest getting a style with bigger lenses if you are an adult male."
1,Poorly made,"These lenses broke after only two months of use. They shattered in multiple lines down the lens after being left in my truck in the sweltering 65 degree heat we had here in New England. Contacted Luxottica only to be told to send them at my expense with a check for $12.50 for them to ""look at them"". I obliged thinking that they would repair the single lens... Not so. I received an email asking for more money to replace the lenses. I would not give them more money for an item that was still under warranty and I already sent them a check. They were obviously faulty and I will not do business with Ray-Ban (or any Luxottica owned brand, which is most) again. Very disappointed."
4,Good,"Good for driving in the snow and in sun. No glare, And decreased air hitting eyes from the sides too with the big side handles"
3,Sizing is off,"I bought the black framed version of these from Sunglass Hut and they fit my enormous head quite nicely, but then I lost them. I purchased this pair with the tortoise frames but they were way too tight for my head. I also purchased the tortoise framed version direct from Ray Ban and they too were too tight. I went back to Sunglass Hut and got a black pair again and they fit. So not sure what is up with the different sizing but keep that in mind when purchasing if you perhaps tried them on in a store and purchasing online.The glasses are great when they fit, love my black pair"
1,What a waste of money!,"I have seldom felt that I wasted my money so badly. I expected real Bollywood music, steps... you know an Indian routine which will make me feel like dancing and working out to some of the great Bollywood movie songs. Instead, there comes Hemalayaa, a beautiful woman, very fit, but which lacks the grace of a real Indian dancer and all you do I guess is ordinary aerobics with some type of weird techno wannabe Indian music. Please... do yourself a favor, if you are looking for a Bollywood workout thinking you will be dancing like Karina Kapoor or Kajol... THIS IS NOT WHAT YOU WANT. Go get Bollyrobics with Julia Casper. She is what you want."
3,Work out,"Great dance/workout, great wardrobe and set but they should of cleaned the floor:o/. Little embarrassed for her. And you do need lots of room and good knees! But if you do what she says ...and take care of yourself, you'll be ok."
3,Fun Workout...,This is a fun workout than will have you sweating immediately! The music is great and the teacher gives good instruction and the pace is just right. If your a larger person like myself you may find some of the dance moves and the jumping around to be hard on your knees. I would be careful doing this video and maybe just glaze over those parts until your physically ready. Some of the thing she does in the video can be dangerous for a person carrying a lot of excess weight. Find your own limits and don't do anything that may lead you to injury.
2,Glad I didn't buy this one,"I love the music and dance sequences in Bollywood films, and so I figured a DVD with that same spirit and moves would be a fun change of pace. I usually workout with Jillian Michaels' DVD's, and I checked this one out from the library to alternate with those. Mostly I will say that this video is annoying. Hemalayaa does a voiceover explaining the movies, and she often breaks into giggling for no reason. Her cuing isn't very helpful or timed well, especially when you're not in a position where you can keep your eye on the television. Finally, I didn't even break a sweat. It's just not that challenging and doesn't have much variety in moves. I'm glad that I didn't buy this one years ago when I saw it for sale and it was new. I'm taking it back to the library today."
4,Enjoy this light and lively work out,"As work outs go, this one is light and fun and still makes me sweat and burn. I enjoy working out with this video and the time seems to just fly by."
5,Great workout,"Bollywood dancing, in my opinion, is the top 3 best workout you can do. You work your body from head to toe and you learn cultural indian dancing at the same time. Can't get no better than that."
1,TERRIBLE FOR YOUR ANKLES AND KNEES,"I LOVED Hemalayaa's workouts on my On Demand Fitness channel, so I bought this video. Even though other people warned me about the poor choreography, the strange timing and the terrible hopping in place--which, the way she does it, is very very bad for your tendons and knees--I thought they were just overcritical and negative.But they were not being overcritical.I have been dancing my whole life for joy and exercise and I have never had any issues with my knees or ankles. This video gave me issues immediately. When I showed the moves to my doctor, she freaked out.The entire middle section consists of jumping and hopping around in place.Please be careful. Though I have truly valued her very loving and terrifically fun other workouts--I warn you not to buy this one!"
5,Fun Dance Cardio Workout!,So happy I rented this. I had so much fun with this workout that the time just flew by. I love to dance so this is the perfect way to get my daily cardio workout in. It is so nice that even if you only have 15 minutes you can work up a sweat and as a mom of a 3 year old I need that flexibility. Hemalayaa has a fun and engaging teaching style. I can't wait to try more of her workouts.
4,Fun but... a beginner workout,"I love Hemalaya she is so much fun to dance with. But I did the whole tape and really didn't feel to woren out...I think its because we don't really do extended cardio work outs, she's always stopping to stretch. Well maybe if I do a strength work out before this one it help tire me out, and help make me sore the next morning! If you are a beginner I'm sure it will make you sweat!"
1,"""Burn""? Hardly","This is not a workout. It has a few cute moves with lots of shoulder shrugging, but:1) the first 15 minutes have zero potential to raise your heart rate2) the other 15 minute blocks raise your heart rate for only one minute, when you put all the moves together3) the pacing is completely off -- any time you think you're going to actually work out, they start doing stretches and slow moves that blow it.I especially don't understand the worthless foot twists, bows to the floor, etc....and suspect Hemalayaa is mostly using these as an opportunity for hair flips. In short, don't waste your money (that's what you're doing, if you're actually buying this with the idea that it is about fitness). The CRUNCH videos are easily as fun, and manage to get your heart rate up and keep it there, if only for 20 minutes or so."
1,Bollywood dance,"Yes, you will get a good workout but this was not what I was expecting. I was looking for more of an Indian dance routine/workout like I saw on Fittv with Instructor Sarina Jina. This DVD combines several Indian dance moves with crisscross jumping jacks, half jacks, squats... However, the workouts were difficult to keep pace with because the instructional part was poorly done, there were no countdowns on the crisscross jumping jacks, half jacks, hop turns and jumps making it difficult to distinguish when to perform the next routine/move. I've been playing the Workout II without the instructional part, just the music and attempting to figure out the moves sequences on my own."
3,Low impact and different,"This workout video is totally different than anything I have done before. It is great if you want to try something different or if you are getting bored with the same workout routines. I have only tried the first segment and didn't find it all that challenging. I am not exactly a workout buff, actually I am quite the opposite. This video is great for a beginner working out or perhaps like a said someone who is bored with just the same moves. I think the direction given is good and the moves are fun to do."
3,Fun but pacing needs work,"This is a fun video, but it moves very fast and doesn't give you enough time to learn some of the moves. I also had a problem with the pacing -- in the middle of an intense, high-impact cardio workout you suddenly stop and do yoga, then you suddenly start dancing again. I would prefer the workout more thoughfully designed, building up to the more difficult stuff, and having the yoga be a separate workout. There is a LOT of jumping involved, which is really bad for your knees. There should be alternate moves for people who prefer not to jump. Also, the instructions are good but could use a little more attention to detail -- for example, if you are bending forward and can't see the screen, there should be a little more instruction so you know to get up and start moving again. Finally, the outfits are fun (though hardly workout clothes) but I was a little confused at all the zooming in on the butt... this is an exercise video, people, not a music video."
1,A sad book that has generated much pain,"Dr. Biklen is arguably the most informed promoter of facilitated communication in North America. However, lurking in his book is evidence that FC is generally useless, except for a small percentage of persons diagnosed with autism -- those with normal or above average intelligence who have a profound communication disability.Unfortunately, the excessive claims made by this book have helped raise the hopes of countless parents of autistic children, only to have them cruely dashed."
1,Autistic people should not be used as Ouija boards,"People considering buying this book should be aware that more than 50 studies have shown that in the vast majority of cases, the facilitated ""messages"" come not from the autistic person but from the facilitator. Proponents of FC have responded by claiming that any kind of scientific study destroys the ""trust"" necessary for FC to work, and then demonstrating this ""trust"" by such practices as ignoring all non-facilitated attempts at communication, and even using physical force to hold some ""clients"" at the keyboard. Autistic people deserve better than to be used as human Ouija boards for ""normal"" people's fantasies."
2,"well-written and intended, but misinformed and unresearched","While Bliken is a talented writer, his subject matter leaves much to be desired. He attempts to prove a topic that he has not fully researched, nor does he seem inclined to believe that he needs to fully research it. Since Bliken's findings, scientific research has been done, and it has proven Bliken and Facilitated Communication to be well-intended, but terribly misused and virtually, wrong."
2,Good Music but choppy video,I bought this DVD a week after I saw Dierks in concert. The concert I attended was excellent - a very high energy show. I wanted to get this DVD to see if I could capture that excitement in a DVD I could watch at home. The music on this DVD is recorded extremly well. It is so clear I had to look a few times to make sure they weren't lip syncing. Nope it was him singing and very well with tunes I love. So as far as the band and the music I easily give this disk 5 stars. The problem is the video portion. One reviewer said that they changed images about 50 times a minute. I thought that was an exaggeration but he was spot on. There is no scene in the whole DVD that lasts more than 5 seconds. I know there was a great concert there somewhere because I heard it. But I couldn't see a concert. It was like an MTV spin where the scene changes almost constantly. If you don't mind that buy the DVD. If you do then see Dierks live as he puts on a great show.
1,MUSIC IS GOOD BUT HARD TO WATCH.............,"THE MUSIC ON THIS DVD IS GOOD. THE VIDEO PORTION WILL GIVE YOU MOTION SICKNESS. THE VIDEO EDITING IS TERRIBLE.IT'S SO CHOPPY THAT EACH SCENEIS ABOUT 1 TO 2 SECONDS.IT STILL AMAZES ME THAT IN THIS DAY AND AGE WE STILL HAVE A TON OF VIDEO EDITORS THAT THINK THAT 50 DIFFERENT CAMERA ANGLES EVEY MINUTE MAKES FOR A WATCHABLE SHOW. IF YOU LIKE THAT KIND OF CONCERT FILMING, THEN THIS SHOW IS FOR YOU."
5,Clear and so true!,"If you are looking for simplicity on your spiritual quest, you will certainly enjoy this DVD. The path of the light is above all religious vision and Shri Pujya Swami gives us a sincere message to make a good start to acquire harmony in our daily life!Music, images and commentary are full of authenticity!Watch this DVD and get a deeper insight in Sadhana pratice! Not too long, not to short, this DVD gives a fresh feeling of Unity! it is a good reminder of the main goal of our life! Bravo! In spiritual practice, often, the more it's simple, the more it's easy to make a real change within ourselves!"
5,all i did was ask by terry gross,"very good, excellant. if you are a fan of terry gross and npr, you will enjoy this book."
3,Entertaining,"Not as enjoyable as her live show (but, then, what COULD be), but still a fun look back at some interesting people."
2,Sole Rationale,"After checking out all the other reviews I had to add that as far as I know this is the ONLY Rationals CD available. Their great Crewe album with ""Barefootin'"", ""Temptation 'Bout to Get Me"" and ""Handbags & Gladrags"" has never been released on CD (I don't think). Someone please release the good, soulful stuff!"
4,soulful,"I have been a fan from the mid sixties, and have seen them many times in the small clubs around Detroit and Ann Arbor. This album is not up to the real thing, but then nothing ever is. Hope they come out with another album, with I Need You, Respect, Sing and all the other GREAT soulful singing that I know they can do."
1,Looking for Respect...,"Great liner notes, but disappointing music. I've been looking for a single or album with their version of Respect for decades."
1,they are a much better band than this CD indicates .,"What about about all the hits-Respect, I Need You and Gladrags (might not be the title, it's an old Rod Stewart tune) They were an excellent band from Ann Arbor with a huge local following and hopefully a greatest hits from old studio recordings is coming soon"
1,Rationals are better than this CD,"Jeep Holland was the manager, A2 Recordings in Ann Arbor. Anyone with the ability to get them to record a CD with all of the great songs? They include to those listed in the emails here: Leavin' here, I need you, Hold on baby and others"
3,"Rationals - 'Live At The Grande Ballroom - Nov. 27, 1968' (Total Energy)","Decent live album offering from the late '60's garage / soul band. Tracks that I thought made this archive live recording worth checking out were ""Fever"", the jamming ""I Get Evil"", ""Ha-Ha"" and their ten-minute cover of Willie Dixon's ""Wang Dang Doodle"". I thought that 'Live At The Grande Ballroom' served the purpose of maybe having like a souvenir-like (sort of) bootleg-ish live recording of this long-gone group. Another cool band to come to us direct from Detroit. Should appeal to fans of Mitch Ryder, Frijid Pink, MC5 and early Bob Seger."
1,not their best offering,"their older music, re: respect, sing, i need you, ect., was much better. very dissapointed, their a much better band than this effort shows."
4,Great drum for beginners,"I just received this drum and I'm pleased with the way it looks and sounds. I think I will have it tuned by my teacher, but I'm confident I can play and do my homework on it.The dums are decent, the Teks so-so (but this might actually be because I'm a beginner). I'm petite and this drum is not heavy or uncomfortable for me. The case is all nylon so its good for transporting it around but don't expect it to protect your drum. It is covered in fake leather which I have seen that it wears and tears ugly, but I'll wait and see if that happens and when.The drum also comes with a second head, both are synthetic, and a little allen key to tune and switch heads if necessary."
5,Awesome,"Very good Arabic drum. I advise everyone to buy it since it has a really good price, shape, and most importantly, sound."
1,"Great topic, weak book","Much of what these authors identify as ""Presbyterian"" would not be recognizable to any of the earlier generations who owned that label. A low view of Biblical authority, a loose cafeteria view of confessions, a man-centered theology -- that used to be called ""Unitarian"" not Presbyterian!More or less a waste."
5,Being Presbyterian in the Bible Belt,This is the third copy of this book I have bought for friends. It is simple to read but very clear and informative.
3,disappointed,"I ordered this cushion and thought I was going to be pleased by the reviews...it turned out to be a big disappointment because it lost a lot of resilence just in a week and when I sit on it, it presses all the way to the bottom of the chair and isn't very supportive... wish I had ordered the 4"" thick one....it being a medical cushion, I thought it would have been better...just have to keep searching for one that doesn't go limp."
2,blurry,"Private Buckaroo was blurry, but stage door canteen was clear. You get what you pay for. Don't buy is my review."
3,not that rummy,"I was looking for a soap that would leave a nice strong spice, sweet scent, but this smells more like dial soap after you step out of the shower, and it does not last that long. It also had a more prominent scent of lavendar which is not a good thing to add if you want a strictly rum smell.Still looking for a rummy smell."
3,Forensic Buff,"A lot of settling of AFrica of different people. It is very hard to follow, but I will keep on trying."
3,"Good, but not great.","I purchased these dies when I purchased my Hornady LNL. They do the job they were intended for but I feel like you have to tinker with these dies more to get them functioning properly. For instance the standard Hornady 9mm die set comes with a role crimp seating die. For anyone new to reloading as I was, they will have to find out the hard way that there is hardly any use for a roll crimp on 9mm rounds, other then to eliminate the some of the flare you put on it. That some flare will be eliminated buy a taper crimp die though. So do yourself a favor and pick up some RCBS carbide dies that have a taper crimp built into the seating die. They are also easier to adjust in my opinion. Do I regret buying these dies, no, but only because I learned from my mistake."
5,Great set of dies,"What can you say about reloading dies? These, as expected work perfectly. I use them to reload my 9mm luger rounds. The only problem I had was zeroing in the crimp, but I think that was ""user error""."
4,Okay Speakers,"These speakers are adequate for my relatively low power audio amplifier. I installed the speakers under the dash of a classic car; that was easy. The sound is good considering the old car is noisy. Overall, for the low price and for a low power amp these are fine. Hint: I'm not into loud volume or overbearing bass - anymore."
1,Worst speakers ever,"I had very low expectations when I got these but not even those were met. The sound quality was unbearably bad, even on an NPR talk show!"
3,Pretty good stuff but not as good as Nestle,I love hot chocolate epecially around this time of year. Swiss Miss is definitely my favorite hot chocolate mix. I especially love hot chocolate with marshmallows. A lot of hot cocoa mixes have a chalky after taste in them (including Swiss Miss) but this cocoa mix is more chocolate than chalky. Unfortunately the marshmallows in this mix pretty much melts the second the hot liquid hits the cocoa powder. It is much better to buy the regular hot cocoa and a bag of marshmallows separately.
5,Swiss Miss Yum,"Swiss Miss states that their marshmallow cocoa mix is made with care in a real dairy where fresh milk from local farms is delivered daily, dried, and blended with premium, imported cocoa. They also state that their hot cocoa mix has as much calcium as an eight ounce glass of milk. I find all of this rather comical considering you are getting a 90 calorie sugar mix that tastes super sweet and has marshmallows that get vaporized by hot water. We're not lookin' for healthy when it comes to hot chocolate. We want yum and that is what Swiss Miss delivers. Swiss Miss just needs to change their advertising campaign."
5,Preaching for Adult Conversion and Commitment,"I found this book refreshing and informative. It reminds us that preaching is more than proclaiming a list of rules to follow to be better people. Preaching, as foolish as it is (according to the Apostle Paul), is the means God has chosen for the transformation of the world. So, we preach in faith, believing that the Holy Spirit will bring about a continual conversion of both we who preach and those who hear us. Preaching for conversion does not come naturally to us - it is much easier to just go with the flow. Thank you Frank Honeycutt for reminding us of our calling and for giving us tools to help us fulfill that calling."
3,Over my head,"I'm a Christian and I believe God made me, the Earth and the Universe and all things are held together in His Hands. But I'm not very scientific and know very little about astronomy. So this book went right over my head and I never got passed the first chapter. But I did pass it on to my bil who knows more about it and finds it interesting. So, my rating is based on the fact that, as a novice, I couldn't get a handle on it. It didn't catch my interest. It is not based on whether Seiss is right or wrong or technically correct about his ideas."
4,Looks cool but does it improve your sound?,I sensed an improvement in tone after using this ligature and it makes my mouthpiece look professional. Its affordable price makes it a winner.
4,Makes you look like a pro!,I like the way it fits and the way it looks. Not really sure if it makes you a better player.
1,poor quality,First customer service person did not comprehend that the picture online looks nothing like the product that arrived. The picture shown is brown with smooth surface with a leather like appearance. What arrived was a black linen texture rubber ligature that was of poor quality and torn/sheared seam on the inside. Obviously no quality check of product prior to packing and shipment.I was transferred to another customer service rep and they explained that there are many Rovner ligatures that the display picture is not always what model you are purchasing.. .case in point I did not receive what was pictured. JUST SAYING THIS GAL IS NOT HAPPY!They did offer for me to return the product for equal replacement....it took a week for the item to arrive so doesn't that mean that it will be another 2 weeks before I have it again? Not happening here! Don't waste your time with this purchase.
3,"Works, but...","This stuff works as advertised, and that can be alot to say these days, but the pricing is nuts for what it is and how much you get."
3,Realtree Camo Tape,"Good product... However I was a bit disappointed with the color. It was a bit washed out and faded looking. I have ordered a lot of the snow pattern by McNett and it is simply brilliant stuff. But the Realtree just didn't have the same ""wow"" effect. If you are looking for a good hunting camo however, this is a good product to consider. No sticky mess... Applies quickly and removes quickly."
2,Not traditional woodland camo.,"The camo on this cloth tape is ugly, not the traditional woodland pattern that the Navy and other branches use to wear. It is mainly tan dominant not green or brown. Overall i am not satisfied."
4,Cool!,if this stuff lasts a few years i will change it to love it..it sticks like glue. and they send you enough to cover your gun
3,not enough tape for the money,"I got this tape to cover up my Gamo Whisper for hunting. It goes on easy and looks great, but I ran short of tape before I finished covering the rifle. For the amount of money paid I expected to completely cover the rifle with some to spare. I'm really disappointed that I have to buy another roll to finish the job."
3,Detroit w/Mitch Ryder - 'Get Out The Vote' (Total Energy),"Nice audio keepsake/rarity for any Mitch Ryder fan.Appears to be an audience recording,with a few flaws.Other than that,I liked 'Get Out The Vote' for what it is.Tends to bring back a few memories when I hear tunes like ""Let It Rock"",""C.C.Rider"",""Jenny Takes A Ride"" and specially ""Devil With A Blue Dress"".Was recorded at a voter's demonstration rally(or something like that) on April 1,1970.If you can't locate a copy of it,try contacting the label themself.Last I checked,they had several copies remaining."
2,don't buy if you're an experienced java programmer,No need to read this book if you already have some experience with Java in a moderate sized project. I could not find any exceptional knowledge and is a little advanced than an entry level book. Book does not live up to its promise.
2,"Useful, but not hardcore","There are a few good chapters here, which would have made great articles. The author's experience (and bias) as a C++ developer shows in much of this book, however. Perhaps a better title would have been ""A C++ Developer's Hard Look at Java""."
2,Misleading Title,"I gave this book 2 stars more for content than for anything else. When I saw 'Hardcore' in the title, I thought the book would have more advanced programming techniques; optimization, advanced use of interfaces, etc.What I found was a book with information that is mostly either common sense or something that should have been learned in computer science 101. I've been programming in Java for a little over four years and there is nothing new in this book for me.On the up side, the book read fairly well. If you don't know Java and are fairly new to programming you might find the book helpful. But if you are looking for anything ""hardcore"", you won't find it here. In my opinion, it should have been named something like ""Java, Best Practices"" or something similar."
3,every programmer should understand these concepts,"Don't let the name fool you: except the last chapter on Tiger JDK 1.5, there is nothing hardcore about it. Every Java programmer should understand all the concepts in this book. Read the table of contents and buy the book only if you aren't completely comfortable with each topic."
2,"Full of errors, avoid","This book has many errors, both typographical and factual. A lot of the advice is dodgy, to say the least. My impression is that the author is trying to write beyond his competence level, but at the same times manages to be patronizing. I'm currently preparing a (practically) page-by-page critique of the problems with this tome. I'll publish a link here when I have a substantial section completed. (Note - this goes way beyond the errata published on the O'Reilly site.)"
3,Good Book for Junior Java Developer,"With all the criticism and found errors being correct, junior Java developer absolutely should not ignore this book.Book is filled up with the good practical techniques and rules of the thumb described in a simple and effective manner. Some techniques, for example use of readResolve method in constant serialization, are explained better and in more practical manner than ""Effective Java"" does.Real book's name should be ""Practical Java development for beginners"""
3,Intermediate Java by a peer,"This book disappointed me. The title raised so high expectations. I started very enthusiastically to read the book and ended in wading through quite a mess.The level of the book is intermediate, certainly not advanced.The topics and treatment in this book are quite mixed in level and style. A little about the language itself (so I learned happily about the existence of labels in Java), a lot about the API (here I appreciated most the dynamic proxy and the reference package discussion) and even an entire chapter on design (which I did not like at all).If you want to learn a little more about Java and have already read the top notch ""Effective Java"", then this book is full of useful suggestions of areas for further exploration."
2,Overall A Big Disappointment,"While there are a few nuggets of wisdom sprinkled throughout the book, there is far too much fluff and error to make it a worthwhile read. As for the good, the earlier chapters have some good advice on good coding practices and detailed explanations of why these are good practices. However, most if not all of this advice is also contained in the book Effective Java by Joshua Bloch. As for the bad, there are gobs and gobs of errors throughout the book and there are at least 3 chapters that are of dubious value in a book entitled Hardcore Java (Data Modeling, Proxies, and the JDK 1.5 overview). And yes the back cover does in fact state, ""... you'll master the art of writing and maintaining bulletproof and error-prone code ..."". Bottom-line, not recommended."
4,Innovative very intriging,These guys dont make bad musuic. I give this album 4 and a half stars. Its almost perfect but there are 2 songs that dont fit on the album. Once again though i only found 2 songs that have women vocals. I dont know what happened but there older stuff was all about wild vocals which you see in this album also. They also use a lot of violins and keyboard mastery at its best. Dark moor the more i here them they are really maturing a lot as a band that will keep on making great albums. Listen to the solos also some of them are super crazy like the wild that i was talking about. This band somewhat reminds me that in a band you dont always have to play the same jhandra its good to explore out of the box a little such as they do in a few of there songs. I would check this one out if your a hardcore fan of dark moor you have to own this album....
3,"OK, But,...","I have one major nitpick about the 2002 calendar. All of the pictures are much smaller than those in the 2001 calendar. Although I like the purple emblem in the background, I'd have rather see that space taken with the photos."
3,okay dvd for a 1 year old,"this dvd is okay, but i think my daughter will like it more when she gets older. she does not understand the whole ""doctor visit"" thing, so it does not quite keep her interest as much as the other elomos world dvd's, such as Opposites. its a cute dvd, but that i am sure she will enjoy more when she is a little older. she is 14 months now."
5,Perfect for a 2 1/2 year Old to demystify going to the Doctor,My son loves all the Sesame Street tapes. He learns alot from them and it keeps his attention all thorough the long tape. He is more comfortable going to the doctor now that he has seen this tape. It is a must have for pre schoolers.
4,My daughter loves this,This is a cute video to add to your collection. Its not as good as the wild wild west though. My daughter will watch this all the way through but I don't think its as cute as others I have seen but its still worth watching.
1,OOOPS,"I ordered one of these, and got something different than was in the picture. The picture clearly shows a rack that holds the jars so they don't bang into each other during the boiling process. I returned the first one to get the right one. I excitedly awaited the new one, and when it arrived it was the same thing as the first one. I am not going for a third one, as they don't obviously have what I want. I want what is pictured, not the one that will allow the cans to bump into each other during processing."
2,Just because there is a child,"a child involved in the plot doesn't mean that the book is cute. The hero is full of angst. The heroine, a Montesori teacher, moves packs everything up and moves into the home of a virtual stranger. The stranger seems to be unable to tell her to leave. The child is the puppet master."
1,Hackneyed and Boring,Newfield has to be one of the most humorless journalists who ever wrote about the 60's. He calls this an upbeat memoir but I found it a downer. It's a lot of self congratulation with same old cliches and no real thoughtfulness. The world has changed and passed Newfield by. It's all been done before and far better too. Spare yourself.
4,"Should be called: ""Atlas of warfare: 1900-1982""","It doesn't seem appropriate to me that a book published in 1982 can have a title which is inclusive of the entire century. However, the book covers 1900-1982 very well. Major land, sea, and air battles are all presented here with pictures and maps to support the concise dscriptions. I highly recommend this book, but wish a newer edition would come along to pick up the last twenty years!"
3,MIDWEST BOOK REVIEW,"This is the story of Spring on the farm.All the animals are having babies, the horse and the cow, the hen and the goat, and even the duck. Something strange happened with Mrs. Ducks eggs though, only 4 out of 5 hatched.Well, Mrs. Duck knew number 5 must be really special, and was waiting for just the right moment to hatch; but to her horror the little girl from the farm house came and got her egg for Easter. What was mother duck to do?She marched right up to the farm house and found her egg and sat down right on it not willing to let her little duckling be destroyed.That was one brave Mama Duck!To everyone's surprise on Easter morningher little duck baby was born.Happy Easter little duck, welcome to the world! A very cute story!"
2,Not worth it,Don't expect the computer to work. The first thing I did when I received it was to put in the battery. Nothing. It's not worth returning for the price.
2,Why nobody told me it's black and white?,I am disappointed that the photos have no colour. The book does not show the colourful side of New York.
4,Kyle Vincent is a great singer!,"How can someone who call him- or herself a music fan claim that Kyle Vincent can't sing?! He has a truly fantastic voice. I remember the first time I heard him sing in Candy and I was totally blown away immidiately. By the way, if you love Kyle Vincent be sure to pick up a copy of the truly pop classic Candy - Whatever Happaned To Fun. Perhaps the best record ever.As far sa I know Kyle Vincent went solo after Candy. He has made several records and I hold this as his best solo-project in tuff competition with Don't You Know.This is perhaps not a masterpiece in the way that Candy's full-length was in 1985 but it is a truly great record full of catchy songs and thoughtful and beautiful lyrics from one of the best singers in pop today."
1,Disappointing,"After reading all the rave reviews here I couldn't wait to hear this album. After hearing it, I don't get it.Musically, it's OK as I do appreciate the live (rather than synthesized) strings and horns, but the lyrics are very trite. Those who make comparisons to the 70's icons (that Vincent seems so desperate to emulate) well... he isn't there. I see no musical or lyrical growth with this CD over his last. I guess I understand now why Hollywood appears to have dropped this fellow off of their roster.Sorry to contradict those of you who seem to be so enthused about this record, but for me it is a pure miss."
1,Yapping Poodle,"Dude sounds just like a yapping poodle. You know, one of those little fluffy white jobs that launches from the depths of the back seat of an old, vintage Cadillac as you cruise by, yipping and yapping like its life depended on it, little flecks of spittle spattering on the window as you leap back in shock.It gets the adrenaline pumping, but you don't really like it."
1,What is this?,"This isn't music, because this guy can't sing. This is really boring, if you want nice relaxing music, that isn't boring, or terrible like this, then buy Incubus: Make Yourself, then you'll see what real music is all about"
1,"WARNING,WARNING...","do NOT buy Level Five in the mp3 download. You don't get the King Crimson recording, What you get is some lame piece of crap that for whatever dubious reason someone decided to call ""Level Five"". I cannot believe that Amazon would permit this kind of fraudulent bait & switch to be perpetrated on their customers. It's so obvious that I have to think it was knowingly done. A great big disapointment that lowers my confidence in A-dot-com."
5,Level Five is Required Listening,"""Japanese Version featuring Different Tracks from the USA Mail-order Only Release.""Not quite, the US mail order release had the same exact tracks, with a price tag of $16. Anyway, this is a great release from KC's Level Five tour which just completed the end of last year. With a few new songs, not available anyplace else yet, this is a must-have for Crim Fans. The new song ""Level Five"" is more than enough reason to own this masterpiece along with all your other masterpieces by KC."
4,Happy KC,"I beleive this is some of the most surprising music KC has put out, as far as being 90's or 2000 and beyond material. The Projekcts are very interesting. The 90's albums Thrak and Construction of light, are ok; not the best this band has done. Very disciplined music, but different than the 80 s material and obviously the 70's.What can I say, the songs are very good. Deserving 5 stars each (except for construction of light). They played very well on the Tool tour; this cd is proof of that. Adrian Belew, Fripp, Mastelotto and Trey Gunn keep on surprising w intersting music (as opposed to boring).I highly recommend this. Buy it : )"
1,25+ Crimso...,"I have been a huge Crimson fan since the late 70's.I love most of their releases. Like most of the rest.Construkction of the Light and the Projekcts were the 1st real dissapointments. But then Heavy ConstruKction put everything right again....and then there was this. Sadly, this is where I jump off. Aweful."
5,Great book,"Manipulation doesn't have a gender, so when I read the Manipulative Man I thought of many men and women who would fit the ""case"" characters in the book. I just wish I had known how to recognize them at the times I was dealing with them and thinking that ""I"" was the one who was going crazy. I guess that was my first clue. The descriptions in this book make it easy to stop a manipulative person. It is good to know there are things that I can do to protect myself from these high maintenance people. I look at people from a slightly different perspective now. It really is a very readable and insightful book."
5,Great entertaining book!,My family loves these books. There is something for everyone. We have almost all the Bathroom reader books and are always wanting the next book we have not read.
2,Olivermsacks,Not nearly as interesting as 'the man who mistook his wife for a hat' not so much story telling... Didn't finish it. Disappointing
3,anthropology,I wasn't so sure if this book was the one my teacher wanted. Luckily it is. It did its purpose. Good book for a cheap rpice.
5,Who else but Oliver Sacks can make neurology this readable?,"What intricacies lie in the minds of men? Only Oliver Sacks, in this new attempt at bringing the principals and studies of neurology to the common reader by sharing with us these case stories in anecdotal form, can provide such an enlightening answer, leaving us 'neurotic' and waiting for more"
4,Anthropologist account to all and others,"love music, all aspects of it and to hear and read a neurologist's findings and stories of connectiveness associated with music, people's emotions and reactions -- very informative and paints a picture many, if not all can understand. Music is very underappreciated. When you get down to basic scales and progressions and read about how they affect different individuals' lives, it really turns into something else I never considered. A very informative and conscious-opening set of descriptions and accounts...loved it after seeing a program on public t.v. here highlighting the author's life and work.To understand one individual's perceptions of daily life, tasks and how he completes each and to understand their perceptions from their point of view is very interesting."
3,"Sporadically wonderful, consistently immersive.","By no means do clinical case histories hold boundless interest; the cases themselves are only as interesting as they are far from analogy. The book opens with an outstanding treatise on perception (The Case of the Colorblind Artist) but, from then on, Sacks manages to enumerate merely interesting tales of various misperceptions without the neurological backdrop of the first history. This is not a bad thing -- often, by keeping the cases anecdotal Sacks is able to build a very good narrative. Make no mistake -- the book is indeed very good but doesn't set a consistent rhythym (there is a constant battle between clinical examination and anecdote) that is required for any work to be spectacular. I suspect this is in the writing and organization of the material; the material, standing alone, is of a great interest."
4,Navy Woman,"Royce Nyland is a single father who only shows his soft side to his daughter. At work he is just the icy Commander to his staff. That is until Catherine Fredrickson breaks through his icy wall. She becomes very important to him but they have a lot of problems to work out. Most imporatantly the fact that he wants her to quit the Navy and she refuses. Somehow, they will muddle through. I would recommend this book to people who enjoy romance novels."
4,Heartwarming and satisfying!,"Debbie Macomber has a wonderful style of writing that draws the reader right into the setting, so that it feels like the characters are friends and colleagues and we are living and working alongside of. What I appreciated most about this book was that it was so romantic. The two protagonsits were forbidden to be involved with each other because of the Navy's rules against officers fraternizing with their subordinates. Catherine and Royce couldn't express their growing feelings outwardly, so they communicated wordlessly through their eyes and gestures. It was slowly tantillizing, transcending the physical, and was far deeper than merely sexual. Wow! I also appreciated how the welfare of 10 year old Kelly, and both Royce's and Catherine's relationship with her, were a priority over the romance."
3,Just so-so!,"Navy Woman was just so-so. I just wanted them to get together already. They kept going back and forth, back and forth about why they couldn't be together. First it was him, then her, then him, then her. The romance was slow building up too. 3 stars!"
2,You would think that I would better,"Jag lawyer Catherine Fredrickson has found herself at a new posting and with a new XO Royce Nyland. After a while, Catherine finds herself attractice to her boss, but navy regs will make that will never happen.This is the second book in the navy series that I have tried to read, but once again I could not get though the book. I know that other reviewers love this series, but I just can't get into these books."
2,"If you don't like wine, don't read it","I had to read this book for my History of California class. I'm a freshman in college and I don't drink wine, because its illegal (duh!). So I read the whole book, intro, epilogue and all the chapters in between. I fell asleep many time reading this book and if you don't like wine and have no interest in the wine industry of santa barbara don't read this book. If you would to find out more of how the santa barbara wine industry got started by all means by this book and enjoy it becuase it right up your alley. I will say this if I was into wine and stuff I know I would have enjoyed reading this book, but since i don't like that kind of stuu, this book was a bore. i think that if you were doing a report on wine or an industry that has floursihed through the prohibition and politics this would be the main source of all your info if you did the report on the santa barbara wine industry. have fun reading wine lovers!!!"
3,Stones In Water,The book Stones In Water by Donna Jo Nappoli is a good historical fiction book about a boy and his friend that get drafted into the war. Roberto goes through many hardships to try to get back to his family and doesn't now how he is going to do it. He follows his sense of direction and might just be able to get back to his family.This book is a good book for people who are interested in history and don't care about reading bloody stories of a war book.I thought this book was a good book because it kept me interested and made me want to read it and at the same time I was learning about what people had to go through if they where a Jew during the time of Hitler.
5,Rebecca Caudill Young Reader's Book Award Nominee - 2000,This title was appreciated by enough students and professional librarians and teachers to make the Year 2000 list of nominees for Illinois' childrens' choice award named after the Illinois author Rebecca Caudill. This book is best for grades 7 and up.
4,review for stones in water,"This book is very good for the person who wants to follow the trail of a teenage Italian WWII captive. Roberto and his friends are taken by German soliders to a German labor camp. Samuelle a.k.a. Enzo and Roberto are caught stealing eggs and sent to a concentration camp in Ukraine. There Enzo dies from beatings and the cold. Roberto escapes from the camp and starts on a long, dangerous journey. In total Roberto estimates that he traveled somewhere between 220 to 230 kilo meters both on land and water. Although, Roberto isnt alone through this, first he befriends a young Ukrainian boy who helps him escape later from more trouble and an Italian soldier who he can finally talk to and be understood. This book really describes the horrific events of the holocaust and I recommend it if youcan stomach war subjects."
4,"A quick, touching read about a young Italian boy in WWII","This book will touch readers of all ages. An Italian boy is forced to face the troubles of war, and struggles to find his own way to survive and remain strong. Touching and well-written,... this is a fairly quick and easy reading, and is definitely worth it."
3,A good book.,This book is about a boy named Roberto and his friend Enzo. They were taking to a labor camp and badly treated. Enzo endes up dying of the cold weather. Roberto endes up breaking out and tries to go back home. If you like what it is about READ IT!
4,My English teacher made me...,Stones in WaterAfter the Germans take Robert and his friends away and his best friend Samuel dies at one of the work camps Robert runs away from the work camp in search of his home. Robert has to rely on his wits and courage to make it home&#65533; This was a great book full of suspense and action I really liked this book the main character was tuff like a boy should be. I recommend this book to any guy who loves war books and to see a little death.
2,"Horrible...a bad ending, no meaning, and a waste of time.","That's exactly what I thought when I finished this book. The plot is intruging and suspenseful at times, but that's the only praise I can think of for Stones In Water. Everything else stinks. Its supposed to be an edge-of-your-seat book but most of the action failed to catch my attention. The storyline is sometimes hard to follow and the action of the book is poorly described. Speaking of descripition, the only characters well described are Roberto and Samuel, the two main characters.I have enjoyed many books by Donna Jo Napoli but I did not enjoy this one. Don't waste your time on this book."
3,Needs an epilogue or something,"I thought the book was great, but it ended so suddenly. I alsothink it needs a better title or they should explain better at theend. END"
4,Stones In Water,"Stones in Water is a great book about two friends who are trying to survive during WWII. Roberto, Sergio, Memo, and Samuele are taken, from a movie theater, by German soldiers. Roberto and Samuele are taken to the same work camp. The two boys learn that only those who are strong inside and have a sense of hope survive. This book is awesome. Napoli writes with such description that the reader gets involved. As you read, you feel like you are right there with Roberto and his friends during this terrifying experience. You go through many emotions like sorrow, pride, fear, and courage with the boys. I would recommend this book for teens who are looking for an exciting war book that they'll be drawn to."
1,Stones in Water,"Stones in Water is a book about a boy named Robeto, his friends Memo and Samuel and his brother go to see an American film when German soldiers enter the theater and take all the boys. They are sent to a work camp in Germany where Memo and Sergio get seperated by them selfs and Samuel and Roberto stay together. But if the German's find out that Samuel is Jewish it will get them both killed.I didn't like this book very much because i thought it was to unrealistic and to predicabul. For example when Roberto excaped the work camp, how realistic is it that he just walks away into the woods? Or that the soldier that he took along in the boat just happened to know Italian."
4,Great,I think this is the foundational book for wound care. I would recommend it to any nurse who is in charge or anytype of wound care despite the setting
5,Great assist for certification review,"Great book to use in studying for CWS or other wound care certification exams. Up to date information on wounds, healing and important topics for comprehensive wound management. Well worth its price.Donna McClure BSN, RN, ACHRN, CWOCN"
3,Good,"This book incluedes a large amount of very useful knowledge; however, it is not extemely easy to read. There are great charts and assessment forms within the book that are useful. Content is good."
5,Special Bits,"Ever sit on the toilet in a public restroom and look at the fastners holding the stalls together and wonder what type of tool is used to fasten & remove the screws? Well, this is it. If you ever have to remove hardware installed with security fastners, you know how difficult it is without the proper bits. If you only do residentail work, you'll probably never need these. For the price, they are one of those items that you put in the truck ""just in case"""
3,MC 5 - 'American Ruse' (Total Energy),"Most of the tunes on this CD are left overs and out-takes from the band's 'Back In The USA' lp recording sessions.You know,cutting room floor material.But for the true MC 5 fan,it's okay.With a total of fourteen tracks,only a few are a bit muffled-sounding.The cuts I liked best are ""Human Being Lawnmower"",the hard-hitting ""Looking At You"",""Teen Age Lust"" and ""Black To Comm"".Pretty much aimed at MC 5 die-hard fans."
5,"A ""must-have"" book for classic movie lovers.",Bruce Hershenson's poster books are an extraordinary value. The poster reproductions are gorgeous. A remarkable visual treat.
4,good book,"it gives you some good voicings and ways to play phrases that can monk up your versions of these tunes, but it does require a fair amount of jazz guitar ability to really benefit you."
2,Do you like Bill Walton?,"Yeah, neither do I. So if you want to spare yourself a couple hours of hearing big Bill yammer on, avoid this collection. Did I mention the cheezy musical fanfare all around Bill's voice on these cd's? It's like NFL films music run amuck for 2 straight hours. The pictures are good, but the book isn't much to read, and it's all so cluttered (does being hip and cool have to mean unreadable?) it made my skull ache."
1,very un-good,"Not good stuff here people. Very weak track selection and all were completely forgettable if one even cared to listen to the whole sub-par track. Not a single one is even remotely a keeper or one that you would ever want to hear again. Really bad vocals, too. Avoid this one! If this is one of your better CDs, you need better CDs!"
4,Will Shakeaspoint meets Marlon Brando,"More a fond look back at one of the early Method Actors. The play has been slightly rearranged but this adaptation has not worn well. Given that it's over 50 years on, that's not surprising. Still Brando does a passable job without Stratford training or much introduction to Shakespearian acting I suspect. The sets are good for the period and the story moves along with that growing sense of doom that all good JCs should have."
4,Great movie to show in classroom,"I found this movie to be an excellent tool for the classroom. Marlon Brando's speech ""Friends, Romans, countrymen lend me your ears..."" is delivered powerfully. Unlike many of the other versions of Caesar where this speech is given in a slow, high-brow tone, Brando actually commands the attention of the marketplace making it much more believable.The other aspect about the movie that is worth considering is the amount of extras on the sets. BBC productions are great, but they use a sparing amount of extras. This version has people hanging from every horizontal and vertical surface at times. That makes for a decent atmosphere.It's simply a solid movie."
3,Julius Caesar,"The movie is in black and white and is the Shakespeare version. Who wouldn't enjoy seeing any movie with the youthful Marlon Brando, who was not only attractive, but a gifted actor. However, if you're looking for historic accuracy you won't find it here. That was obviously not one of Shakespeare's priorities. Actually, his version of ""Julius Caesar"" is more about glorifying a fictitious Mark Antony. In truth Mark Antony was anything but a hero. I was very disappointed in the actor they chose to play Julius Caesar: an extremely unimpressive, doddering old man. Caesar, from most accounts, and from sculptures created not too long before his murder, was a well-built, youthful and handsome man. And from his very own war commentaries as well as other sources was brilliant and a military genius. Fans of Shakespeare will no doubt disagree with me but I found this movie to be a disappointment."
5,stop calling him the bard,"we get it, you 'know' shakespeare. wanna be a laughing stock in scholarly circles? call him the bard. anyone with nothing to prove just calls him shakespeare. homer was a bard.ps. brando's great in this production."
1,Poor quality,The VHS tape had flickers of yellow squares throughout it and began skipping all around. I checked my VCR with another tape and it worked perfectly. I was really disappointed with this product
5,Classic Julius Caesar.,"This is the video you are looking for, especially if you plan to show this to a class of students."
4,Julius Caesar movie,"Brando, James Mason, and Louis Calhern were excellent. John Gielgud was stiff and didn't seem villinous or clever. Seemed to love the sound of his own voice. Supposedly he coached Brando and in a few lines Brando sounded phoney too but mostly terrific. One wonders why Greer Garson bothered. A good production of the Shakespeare play."
4,Enthralling.,"One quickly adjusts to this being black and white. The attention to detail and creation of atmosphere are wonderful. This is an excellent performance, well cast on the whole. Louis Calhern is a kindly Caesar, and so the assassination is shocking. Guilgud is wonderful as Cassius, looking lean and hungry as he ought. James Mason as Brutus seems not entirely convinced that his altered course of action is the right one. Marlon Brando has wonderful classical face and body, is therefore acceptable. We all have our own ideas of how the famous ""Friends, Romans, countrymen ...."" speech should be acted, his performance was not as I would have it done, but who is right? None of these minor negatives could spoil the enjoyment of this brilliant and totally absorbing production."
4,Product was as specified,product was as specified and delivered when promised. There is not much else to say about the product. What more can you ask for?
5,Great DVD from a Great Band,"I watched this DVD last night and have to admit it is the best live DVD I have purchesed.The set consists mainly of songs from the million selling album Final Straw, with a few older tracks thrown in for true fans.Gary's performance is excellent as he holds the sold out crowd in the palm on his hands, whilst he belts out hits such as Chocolate, Spitting Games & the breakthrough single Run.If you have ever caught the band live you will love this DVD, if you havnt this is a great chance to see what your missing.The DVD is packed with features that are very entertaining.If your considering buying this DVD just buy it you wont be disapointed!!!"
1,Absolutely the worst...,"...concert DVD I've ever seen.I'd never heard of Snow Patrol before last week, when I read that U2 was considering them for the opening slot on next year's tour. I thought ""how bad can they be""?Actually, they're not that bad.Nothing new, nothing exciting, and nothing you haven't heard before.But the thing is...this is the worst sounding and worst visual DVD imaginable.You think the Bowie Reality Tour DVD jumps around, camera-wise?You ain't seen nothin' yet!This is unwatchable...totally unwatchable.I bought it on a whim and I seriously regret it.Don't even approach this, unless you're a Snow Patrol fan who thinks that music progresses naturally from The Beatles to Snow Patrol.That one star is up there only because we don't have a ""no star"" option.Snow Patrol...do yourselves a favor.Hire a new director next time out.This one failed you miserably."
2,"It is written using old English terminology, not American.","Instead of explaining step by step instructions like other service manuals, Haynes prints entirely to much detail in one large confusing paragraph."
2,Worth the money? I'm not sure.,"I am about half way through Pimsleur's Japanese I tapes. Although the real test will be when I arrive in Japan, I can already say that I have learned quite a bit. The Pimsleur format is great because it really helps with listening skills and pronunciation. I find the lessons easy to follow along with and I retain most of the vocubalary. I was previously working from the Japanese for Busy People book alone, and I can tell you that the Pimsleur tapes have saved me from mispronouncing a lot of the words I learned. All in all, I am quite pleased with the tapes.However, I cannot say that they are worth the incredibly high price. They are, after all, little more than cassettes/CDs that consist of Japanese speakers repeating words and phrases. I cannot imagine why the price is so high. Were this product about a third of its present price, I would rate it 4 or 5 stars. My advice: buy it used, borrow from a friend, split the cost with someone, or check the library."
2,boring and over priced,"I had rather liked the beginner's version, so I bought this set[luckily on a promotional sale]. I found it utterly boring, and geared too specifically toward businessmen. Then they assume for example that you will arrive at a hotel in your car [like in America], when, believe me, that is highly unlikely, unless perhaps you live there [and then would you really need these records?]. The likelihood that you will be asked at a colleague's house is also somewhat remote.It would be more useful to learn how to ask for items at a convenience store or where the toilets are, or the cash register, than some of the conversation examples given."
3,Quality control,"I am actually writing on behalf of a friend who bought this sometime back. I am a non-native speaker but have been learning the language for more than 3 years. Just want to point out that in Lesson 6 at about 13m30secs the person says ""where would u like to drink something"" but turns out the correct response at about 13m40secs was ""itsu nomimasuka"" or '' ''''', which should be ""when would u like to drink"" instead.It's actually useful if u try to say your response during the 1st pause before the 1st time the answer is played back, and in between pauses I would try to say the correct responses twice before it plays back to practise my speed in responding. Good for practising your reflexes in speaking & pronouncing fast if u already know the content, as most learners can speak but at a slower speed compared to native speakers, although generally Japanese people will be polite enough to slow down to accommodate us foreigners."
1,some of the speakers aren't japanese,"I have a friend who wants to learn Japanese and I've been looking for the right material for him to learn with. I heard a couple of audio clips from Japanese 2 and 3, and apparently, some of the speakers aren't native speakers of Japanese. Especially there is one female speaker who has a strange accent, and I wouldn't recommend this to my friend since I don't want him to have that accent. She is understandable and sounds almost like Japanese, but not quite.They should re-record the audio because I personally like the method very much."
4,Good if you do not like to study books,"The method used in these CDs allows you to pick up basic sentences without ever studying a book. You will progress a lot faster if you do, but I think these CDs are great if you want to listen to them in the car or on the bus. The price is insane, though - especially considering that one set of CDs only takes you as far as the first three or four lessons in most textbooks. Do not forget there are libraries in most cities..."
1,DO NOT USE! Please read this before purchasing!,"I used this on my cat and has seemed to work so far, HOWEVER I came across a site while looking for reviews on another Hartz product and found that Hartz products has been harming and even KILLING MANY MANY animals since 2002! I literally found out an hour ago and have been working hard to tell every pet owner I know! Please check out this site that I found: [...] Hartz is an AWFUL company!"
4,my cats love it so they don't let me forget giving it to them,My cats never let me forget and it seems to work well I do worry as the cats get older that they will get a blockage in their intestine so this is worth making a daily routine.
2,Cat hated this flavor...,"I thought I was purchasing the malt flavor, which my cat has used in the past and which has successfully helped with hairballs, but this salmon flavor was a no go. The product works, just not this flavor for my cat."
3,It works about the same as vaseline.,The cats don't seem to like the flavor very much. They hate when we use it and they try to fling it off. Next time I think I'll just use vaseline.
2,sk8in at an all time low,"Personally i'm a sk8r and love to sk8.INfact thats all i do, ride my zero and play tony hawk. This game represents sk8in in no way. You can't really to tricks, and the ones you can do are stupid. Like the double ollie, thats not even possible. the snowboarding isn't bad. the game has no story, sumthin about punk ass aliens or sumthing. All tou do is ride, shoot these stupid things with a sling shot, and ollie off buildings and stuff. If you want to try it be warned it may suck."
4,"This game is alright, but definately rated pg-13","this game is pretty cool, however its not better than tony hawk games! ... you shoot aliens, skateboard, snowboard, and hoverboard. you cannot shoot while moving but you can preform tricks and grind. This games has challenging levels, but some enemies appear off screen, so you have to watch out! The boss levels are fun and challenging, and kind of like those dancing games in the arcade, if you've ever seen or played one. But, they can get boring. True to its rating, i would not reccomend this game to anyone under the age of 13. unless they are extremely mature. I think that the best part of the game is the cartoon sequences, because in the cartoon they talk all gangsta and on the bottom its all preppy. However, i skateboard and snowboard and am dissapointed at how they percepted how skate and snowboarders are. ..."
1,This game is a waste of MONEY!,"This game has no point, you don't get to do tricks or anything. All you do is shoot aliens, that's it. I don't recemend this game."
1,This game sucks,"How in the world can, someone give this game 5 stars and say it is better than tony hawk. This is a big waste of money, all u do is skate and snow board then shoot sling shots and u cant skate and shoot at the same time u have to stop then shoot. And how can someone say this game is better then tony hawk this kid is 11 he doesnt have enough experience in games 2 review. And the boss levels r rediculously stupid. The funnest thing about this game is the fingerboard and that is no lie."
4,NICE STORY,"The story is cute but very simple and better suited I believe for under 3 years. My son is 4 years and he already had it mesmerized after just a few readings. Great cover, color & details, my son loved pointing out Max's pj's print & candy canes."
5,Candi's review,"I love this program. It's much more enjoyable than Creatures 1 or 2. It's especially nice that you can lead your Norn around by the hand. I'm still learning how to get around. Does anyone know how to get into the tree house? I also think they need more clothes. My grandsons, who are 4, 6 & 8 enjoy Adventures much more too."
4,Creatures Adventures,"My 8 year old grandaughter loves this game now. She was quite distressed when her first little Norm died, though. I guess this is to teach you about the life cycle, but very sensitive children might have a lot of questions or become very upset like she did."
4,Fun but Simple,"Creatures Adventures is so much fun to play! The norns are so cute! I do wish the game was a little more complicated. If you like simple and happy games, this game is for you. But if you like hard games that have lots of violance, don't buy this game. I would recommend it to kids 6-10."
4,Love it!,"Could have came in a better case, could tell it wasn't the original. It didn't have the little booklet. But other than that, everything is pretty good."
3,Creatures Adventures : Fun but emotional,"Creatures adventures is a fun game once you figure things out, but the creatures you raise from eggs, clothe, feed, doctor and play with are soon buried in the nearby cemetary! Very upsetting to young hearts, but those toughies out there will enjoy it!"
1,Not as pictured,the earrings are as explained but the amethyst is far from being the hue that is shown in the picture. buyer beware! the stone looks light pink.
2,pretty earings but......,"As soon as I got them the amethyst fell out, because they were a gift and my Mom didn't want me to send them back because she hadn't even gotten them yet I had them fixed by a jeweler with jewelers glue. The clasp is difficult to figure out too, never seen earing that snap together like these do. I was going to buy another pair for myself but I'm thinking twice about it."
3,It's O.K.,This textbook is good for beginners (which my daughter is). However it doesn't have an answer key for exercises. I hope others will enjoy it.
2,Das Land des Lachelns,"The Morbisch production is great as in all the others, However the main character sung by Sangho Choi is so stiff and with very limited arm movements that makes one think how can Lisa have been attracted to such a charmless character. I suggest to buy the movie that starred Rene Kollo in the main role.He may not be oriental looking, but the cast and the performances are great."
5,History without peer!,"Having long ago lost my original copy from the '70's, I'm glad to see this classic back in print. Fully rounded with details of Jim Bridger, Hugh Glass and others on the world economic canvas painted by John Astor, Berry gives us the complete picture. It should be on the short list for any course in American history along with the Lewis and Clark journals."
2,loud knocking noises,"this a/c does put out cool air, however a design flaw also creates loud erratic knocking sounds. this comes from the condenser fan throwing water up, which is supposed to help cool the condenser coils, but also collects on the top and drips back down into the spinning fan blades. very annoying, especially at night when everything is quiet except for the hum of the a/c and the bang... bang.........bang. i have not heard another window a/c making this sound.the manual, apparently written after the unit was in production, instructs you to ignore those ""pinging"" noises."
3,Decent for beginner/intermediate practitioner,"This video is decent, the workout is not a raging burner, but it does provide a decent workout. The ambiance is semi-boring, a sterile room with hanging sheets-not terribly inspiring. The instructor is cute and upbeat."
3,"Balanced workout, not very challenging","I agree with the other reviewer that this workout is geared more towards the advanced-beginner level and I found it less challenging than the sculpting Pilates classes I take at my gym. Still, this is a great DVD to use for those days you don't exactly want an extreme workout. The instructor is very encouraging and sweet, movements are fluid and interesting. Instead of short and quick repetitions, she emphasizes extending the body line with slower, more controlled movements through the positions. Some parts are tougher but this is great for low-impact exercise. Thorough stretching routine at the end is a nice closure to the workout."
4,Poor packaging,"I had purchased the same headset from Staples and I love it. I bought 5 from Amazon and while it saved me money, I was surprised and disappointed in the packaging. I am giving them to sales people and would prefer being able to give them in a box. Instead, I received them in a padded envelope (could easily have been crushed during shipping) and inside they were only in plastic bags. I hope they are all in working order. I guess the motto is true, you get what you pay for. If I had purchased them from a store like staples they would come in a box and could have probably given them with gift receipts."
3,sounds kind of tinny,"the sound qiuality on this wasn't quite as good as I would have expected from Plantronics. Also, the plug is the 2.5 MM plug, not the 3.5MM plug that is standard in phones these days - you can buy an adapter for a few bucks more - just search 2.5MM to 3.5MM and makesure to get one for phones."
2,Bad mic and bad ear speaker!!,"I needed an ear piece/headset that would allow me a clear sounding voice and I would hear the other party clearly. This headset is below average! The earpiece always makes the other person sound muffled (loud or low volume), and I have to repeat myself at least 3-4 times during every conversation. WOULD NOT RECCOMEND!!! I have found better and cheaper ones at Walma*rt/Best Bu*."
5,Satisfied customer,The customer service was excellent. The product arrived damaged and they immediately responded to my inquiry and helped get a new headset out to me right away.
2,"Great Headset, but not very durable","I have owned two of these headsets so far, I love almost everything about them, Here is what I didn't like:1. Other people hearing you can be a problem.2. The cords on both headsets have broken at the plug end.If you use a headset occasionally, this is a good choice - if you use it alot, look for somesome more durable."
1,no NOKIA compatibility,"It would have been nice to know that this headset does not work with the Nokia 8860. The information [here] leads one to believe that the Plantronics M175 will work on all phones with a 2.5 mm jack. When I received the headset and could not get it to work, I had to call Plantronics customer Service in order to get the info regarding non-compatibility. It would have been nice to have more information BEFORE I made my purchase."
1,NOT 2.5 jack. REPEAT NOT 2.5,"Can't always trust what you read. And those idiots who said this was a 2.5 helped me make a bad purchase. Too bad the answer is not in the product description and you have to depend on someone reviewing the item. Luckily I purchased a Panasonic headset with a 2.5 jack (I was going to compare them). Now, I will compare. What a hassle."
2,"poor mic vol, 6 mos duty cycle",i've had two of these M175 headsets in the last year. only last about 6 months. microphone sensitivity is poor even on the highest setting. people have a hard time hearing me unless i speak very loudly.
1,Doesn't work with I Phone,I initially bought 4 of these for an old phone. Shortly after purchases I upgraded my phone to an I Phone. For some reason these headset do not work with an I Phone. I am quite disappointed and am hesitant to try buying something else in case this is an I Phone issue. Does anyone know of an over-the-head set that works with the I Phone?
5,Excellent for home/office use,"For the price, you can't beat this little headset. The mute switch sets it apart from other headsets, which is a must-have feature for conference calls.It is also comfortable, and in my expererience, fairly durable. I've used this headset for 2 years with no complaints. In fact, I'm listening to a conference call on it right now. :-)"
2,best sound - bad fit,"This unit had the best sound and some of the poorest ergonomics I've encountered. The ear and mic volume control worked great with cordless phones and my Sanyo PCS phone. It was a BIG improvement over my old BodyGlove set. Unfortunately, it does not fit well. The over-the-head component would pop out of the earpiece socket as I put it on. When I resorted to over-the-ear mode, the boom would stick out when the earpiece was flush on my ear. When I set the boom close to my face, earpiece moved off the ear and volume suffered. The last straw was when the 'flexible' ear hanger broke as I attempted to adjust it - I had owned it just three days. Soooo... I'm still looking for the perfect headset."
4,"good, but volume control not really volume control.","I like how it can convert from a clip-on to a headband and vice-versa. One thing I noticed, however, was that the ""volume control"" is NOT really a volume control! It just cuts highs. (makes it muffled) I guess this would be handy if the person you're talking to had a really harsh and tinny sounding phone, but it doesn't reduce the volume of anything other than the high end.Other than that, I give it a thumbs-up."
2,Not great,People I talk with sometimes could not hear what I am saying. I have to shout in order for them to hear me. I end up just taking it out and just speak using a handset.
3,Not as good as original,"I have bought 2 of the Plantronic phones and have replaced only one of the headsets. It was not the original headset that comes with the phone but has many other options.Two gripes.1. There isn't a red light indicator light on this headset, so when you are on the phone, people don't know if you are on the phone for sure or not.2. There is distortion in the earpiece. A steady loud/soft sound. Quite annoying when waiting on hold and there isn't music. Almost like feedback but without the high pitched sound.Other than that, it is a quality headset and is compatible with the phone that I have."
2,Was great until the microphone stopped working,"I had this headset for about six months. Sometimes you had to push the mic near your mouth, but it was comfortable and I rarely had complaints for audio.However, as of today the microphone just died."
5,Best Bluetooth headset so far...,"I have been through 4 different bluetooth headsets so far, and this one is far and away the best. The first was too bulky. The second (Jawbone) couldn't be carried easily when not in use, and got repeatedly crunched in my pocket until it wasn't functional. The third was a motorola flip version, and didn't stay on my ear well. This one fixes all those problems. The carrying case is truly inspired. It works great, and protects the earpiece when not in use. Best of all, you can charge it while it is secure in the carrying case. It fits well, even if you can't easily see the physics of how it will work from the images. Sound quality is great, but wind noise is still a problem. Always has been with headsets, so maybe next model. Overall, a great headset."
2,doesnt work as documented in amazon ad,"I bought two of these to use with mobile phones because of the mute capability ... heh ... it doesnt have mute capability even though the ad reads volume AND MUTE control. I tried it anyway to see if it was more comfortable than the original headsets on my mobiles and the originals were better ... so it was a loss all around. And BTW, whoever decided to put a mute button that has to be held down continously on mobile phones was a sadist ... try holding on down for a hour or more while typing on your computer with the other hand ..."
1,It Broke After 1 Week!,"I got my headset and loved it, the people I was talking to couldn't tell a difference and I was convinced that I was saving my brain from radiation. That was the first week I had it. The second week everyone I called complained that they couldn't hear me because of all of the static on the phone. As soon as I would unplug the headset, ""Oh, that is much better now!"". I would have to recommend against this headset based on what is obviously cheap construction and second-rate components."
4,Good headset,Very good headset. The first one was damage due to improper use. But this is a headset that we use everyday for work. 6 hours per day on average.Not perfect but very good and excellent range.
3,Works fine but breaks quickly,"This headset works fine - the sound quality is not great, but it's not bad either - just a bit muffled - except that mine died within 1.5 years. Given the price and the reputation of the brand, I expected it to work a lot longer."
3,Expected more for the price,"This headset works fine, but I expected somewhat better sound quality for the price. Also have not been able to get it to work with my Samsung Galaxy, I'm guess that was an issue with the 2.5 to 3.5 mm plug adapter I got since it works fine with my panasonic cordless phone. Not sure if this would allow you to initiate a call on the cell phone, however, which is what I am really looking for from a headset since bluetooth headset sound quality is so poor."
2,Shiplama,"Not as decribed M175C the M if for moble phone it did not fot it, the C if for Cell phone it did not fot it, I beleave this is not a true pantonics product. I received a full refund"
1,The second one broke even sooner.,"Yes, we wish we had been wiser and not purchased another one. But we did. Familiarity, availability, a bigger discount... The first one lasted about seven months. The second one not quite six weeks. Same problem, no sound. Both units were never abused, including that we never tried using them in a lightening storm."
3,Loved it while it worked,"I teach online and spend a lot of time on the phone with my students. It's comfortable, the volume was great on both ends, and I hadn't had any problems with it. I have used this headset every day for seven months, but yesterday, it just stopped working in the middle of a phone call and my student couldn't hear a word I said until I unplugged the headset and just used the phone itself. I have tried it again a few times since that phone call and it's still not working. Trust me, I've made sure that I didn't turn the mic off by accident or that there wasn't some other volume control that had been flipped inadvertently. I've always gotten high-quality products from Plantronics, so I was surprised it had such a short life. Disappointing!"
3,nice sound but fragile,The sound is great but the jack tip breaks off easily rendering it useless. Two different headsets did this to me. I will be looking for another brand that is more robust and less expensive.
4,Cell phone headset does the job,"My only hesitation about buying this product was that, while the bluetooth and other wired devices keep getting smaller and sleeker, this one looks like something from 10 years ago. Nonetheless, I recommend it and would buy it again because it gives the best sound quality of the devices I've tried, it's very comfortable (I don't like ear pieces that hang onto my ear for support), and it has volume and mute controls at a decent price. When you find a good price, I recommend buying several so you can keep one in each car, one by each indoor phone (I use it more for hands-free indoors than with my cell phone in the car), and because they will eventually break."
4,Good product with querks,"This headset is great, but takes some getting used to.Trying out the different earhooks takes time. I found that the most comfortable one isn't the best for sound. By reading the other reviews, it's probably because of the shape of my ear. For me, the speaker has to be up against my ear for me to hear well. Some of the earhooks push it away. I never had a problem when I used the headband.The mic worked great. Nobody had a problem hearing me. The swivel, or what's supposed to be the swivel, doesn't work too well. Sometimes I need to move the mic up when I'm not using it. It's easier to just remove the whole unit.Overall it was worth the price I paid. This review lacks the 5th star because it can be clumsy at times and the swivel doesn't work like it should. maybe it's not designed to."
2,Get an M214C instead if you want to wear it over the head...better and half the price,"By trying to be all things to all people, this headset is a compromise. If you just want something to wear over your head you'll find Plantronics M214C to be better, and half the price. Get that instead.(Just to be clear, I do own both this and the M214C)."
4,best I've used yet,"I wanted an improvement over the headset that came with my AT&T 900MHz cordless phone where the people I was speaking with had problems hearing me and the earpiece hurt. This is a huge improvement, I particularly love the volume controls for both the microphone and speaker, and the easy mute button. I find this headset extrememly comfortable and it comes with three sizes of earclips. I did not rate it with five stars because on our other cordless phone, a Panasonic 2.4 GHz, I cannot hear the other person as clearly."
1,This product works great if you have an old phone,"I just got through using the Plantronics live chat available on their website. This M175, according to the technician I spoke with, are not designed to be used with phones over 900 MHz. If you have a 2.4 GHz or 5.8 GHz, you should buy the MX500C or M220C, which are designed not to fry with today's phones."
2,Less than I expected from Plantronics,"I bought this unit based on a few reviews that said it was great. Well, I find that the earphone has sufficient volume, but the microphone boom is inadequate. The boom is too short and I am forever trying to find a position where people can hear me. I don't understand why Plantronics made the boom so short and without any adjustment!I have tried maximizing the volume and have found that the only position that works is to have the headset twisted around so the earphone in half off my ear. That is the only position wher other parties can hear me.Quite frankly this product stinks."
4,Excellent headset,I bought this headset to use with my desktop AT&T EP 5962 2 line phone. It works great and I don't even need an ampleflier
1,Problems with sound,"I bought it to use with Nokia 6100 (which need an adapter) and with Siemens Gigaset. Sound breaks on both phones. You talk for 10 minutes and then it's gone. I liked all the features - mute, volume control but with disappearing sound it's no use.Besides, the voice tube is too short - it is more than an inch from the mouth.Luckily, I bought it from Circuit City so I can bring it back.Advice: buy it first at local store where you can return it later if it works for you. I wouldn't recommend this phone though anyway."
1,Not the Plantronics M175C product!,"Beware the product I received does not appear to be the M175C, as shown on the Plantronics web site. The item I received has the same casual appearance as the M175C; however, it unfortunately has a 3.5mm adapter, rather than the 2.5mm adapter. I called Plantronics, and they said their products with a ""C"" at the end of the model number all have 2.5mm adapters, so a 3.5mm adapter would indicate it is not the correct product. It is also odd that the product I received came packaged only in a zip lock back with a sticker on it that says it's an M175C, so it would seem this could easily have been mislabeled by Amazon (or some distributor). I called Amazon about this, and they indicated they will research it. Hopefully they get this corrected to save others the inconvenience."
3,Good w/blackberry. Not good w/AT&T home phone,Bought this as it is what AT&T had on their website as compatible with AT&T home phones. Comes with an adapter to work with the home phone. Adapter does not fit snug and sound is staticky. Works well without the adapter with my blackberry cell phone. Headset is comfortable.
4,Working!,I like this headset. It works with my cell and business phone...I use it for both. The flexibility of having it be an earpiece as well as headset is great...I'm using the headset mostly. So far so good.
3,Broke before 6 months,"It broke before 6 months of light use, however Plantronics replaced it for just the cost of First-Class postage to return the broken unit after receiving the prompt replacement. Just Google ""plantronics quick web service form"" (without the quotes) and fill out the form."
4,Quality Headset for a Fair Price,"I purchased a Plantronics headset for my office and was happy with the quality...so when I needed one for my cell phone I went with this very similar headset. It will sit on your ear or you can use the over-the-head piece. It has a mute switch and volume adjuster built-in to the wire. Good sound, people can hear me just fine...as good as anything I've seen."
5,"Works great, can type and talk","Does just about exactly what it needs to do. One thing: if you need to sit further from your phone, get an extension cord. The cord on this one is pretty short.Great sound, great clarity of call on both the speaking and listening ends. Great price, great compatibility.Great item."
5,Best headset EVER!,"I've owned close to a dozen phones and headsets over the last few years and had problems hearing and being heard. I need a great quality headset for my home business and this one is AWESOME! The earpiece did not fit my ear well, but the over the head one fit great and it's very comfortable. Works for my home phone and cell phone. Highly recommended!"
4,4.5 Stars!!!!!- worth it!,"I received the M175 in 3/2003- it performed as expected for 10 months (hint - 1 year warranty). The casing on the wire became exposed, which caused noise interference. I use it 4 days a week for 8-10 hours at a time. I got my money worth and recommend it since there are no others on the market with the mute switch and volume control inline."
4,Comfortable; sounds great; you may have to speak up,"This headset works well with my Uniden 900 MHz DSS phone (EXI3965). It is light and comfortable, with good sound quality, and is easy to wear. Microphone sensitivity (when set to the maximum) is only moderate; if you are a loud person you won't notice, but the soft-spoken may need to speak up. That may be because the mic boom ends near my cheek, not my mouth - it should be 1-2"" longer. The volume control has limited range, but was somewhat effective in cutting hiss from an otherwise noisy cordless phone."
5,Very good headset!,"I bought this headset to use with my cordless phone system which I use with Skype. I have a Bluetooth headset on my left ear, and I keep this one on my right so I can answer my cell phone and the regular phone simultaneously while I am working on my computer. I use only Motorola cell phones and Bluetooth units, and previous cordless phone headsets left a lot to be desired. The Plantronics unit is wondeful; it's light enough that I forget it's there, and even half-deaf me can hear it well. The adjustable hearing is great, as is the adjustable volume on the microphone. I heartily recommend it."
5,It works well,"I use this headset with a Motorola Star-Tac. I works perfectly. What make this better is that it is tele-coil compatible, yet reasonably priced. I also find the over the head style more stable, especially on long rides in the car."
1,Seller is Dishonest,"This seller is dishonest. The headset arrived in a plastic bag without any packaging or instruction manual, and it did not have the over-ear attachments that are displayed in the picture on the web site and are supposed to come with the headset. I emailed the companmy to complain, but I never got a response."
3,ONLY FOR CELL PHONES,Even though the connection works with most HOME CORDLESS PHONES... I would only recommend you buy this for use with a cell phone if you want a good CORDLESS headset try Radio Shack or Panasonic on amazon.com
3,Plantronics M-175 -- a mind of it's own?,"The headset is very light a easy enough to use, however there are a few comments that need to be made.Apparently if you have the in-line volume control set to the highest level (or nearly so) the unit must pick up some type of signal from the ether and initiates a re-dial of the last number called [when used on a mobile phone]. Very annoying. Due to this hypersensitivity, you will also hear the ""buzz-click-click-click"" that you sometimes get when certain mobile phones pick up stray signals. Also the plug doesn't seem to fit snugly into the jack/port on the phone and has to be pressed (and held) in by hand - could be an issue with my phone.The volume/clarity in the earpiece is not all that fantastic, and to improve it you still must press the earpiece more firmly to your ear with one of your hands (not so ""hand free) but for a lightweight unit, this could be expected."
2,Comfortable and clear but easily broken,"The headset fits the standard 2.5mm jack found on many cordless phones. The fit is comfortable and the sound is fine, both incoming and outgoing. However, mine broke just shy of two months after I bought it."
2,broke within a week,"I use headsets everyday while I work from home. It is expected to have to replace these from time to time, but this one didn't even last me a week."
3,Plantronics Headset lasted approx 1.5 year,"Used the headset daily at work for 1.5 years with no problem, but then wires gave out and calls had static or no audio at all."
2,Absolutely terrible,"Although this book may be useful as a reference, it is a disaster if you are new to chemistry and don't have a professor, who could explain some topics from this book.In order to understand the book's problems you have to buy separately a solution manual."
2,It did not accurately describe basic principles of chemistry,"It was very difficult to understand. It was poorly written and not thought out very well. Students who use this book have a very difficult time with it. I would not recommend it to be used as a teaching tool, but maybe as a reference guide to those who have already had basic chemistry and have already acquired a knowledge of basic chemistry."
1,Buyer Beware of Anybook Sales,"I was very discouraged. I did not receive the item within the dates as I was promised. It was over 2 weeks late and the item was not in the condition for which I paid. The textbook was also missing the CD and InfoTrac as described. The sellars only comment was that I could return it and receive a 15% discount on my next order. Since it took so long to receive the textbook, I felt I couldn't take the chance of returning it as my son was currently in the class.I will NEVER deal with this sellar again. As an educator, I will not suggest this company to my students."
2,Absolute Filth,"Absolute filth!! I am a student in AP Chemistry and this was the title for our text, until we used the masterpiece written by Steven Zumdahl. This does not prepare one well for any chemistry class, is poorly written, not up to par with our technology today, is written in a very unorganized and in a tengential manner, and, well...absolute filth!"
4,One of the best book for Chmistry,"It was not difficult to understand. It was very well written and thought out very well. Students who use this book has no difficult time with it. I would surely recommend it to be used as a teaching tool, and maybe as a reference guide to those who have already had basic chemistry and have already acquired a knowledge of basic chemistry."
4,Excellent,The product is great. Very useful. But the customer service I received from the seller went above and beyond expectation. Always have reservations ordering things online because you're not dealing with a person at a store location. But this seller really went the extra mile by following up with me. Many thanks!
5,Gleim's CMA Review: Strategic Management,This is a very good review book for the Certified Management Accountant's test. The review is straight forward with section and chapter review questions. The Correct as well as the incorrect answers to the question are explained. This makes it easy for the reader to determine if it is knowledge or misreading of the questions.
3,My opinion about this reference.,"I needed this book to get started to iptables, to make a research for a term paper.What I liked the most is that it has really lots of information (very good variety of matches and targets), but I really disliked the facts that:It doesn't detail how to structure an iptables command (step by step at least).it explains the matches and targets in the same section, kind of a mixture of both, fact that completely puzzled me.It organizes the explanation in alphabetical order, criteria that I thing is the worst to organize technical topics.It is useful if you already understand iptables, but if you are a freshman, you really need to get more information sources."
1,Not even as useful as the man pages,I did not realize that this book was going to be so tiny or I would not have ordered it. Save your money and read the man pages instead.
1,Sick. Very sick.,"Voltaire once said of his adversary Rousseau, ""I disagree with what he says but I will defend to the death his right to say it."" That said, Peter Singer is one sick fellow. It is not so much that he has no feelings (quite the contrary, he seems to be a hedonist), but it is that he assumes that there is (or could be) an authority to decide whose life is worth living and whose isn't. This is to say: society needs a rational organizer and arbiter to be sovereign over all human action. Of course, Singer would argue, reatrded babies would be eliminated by this societal director, but, who is to say the director will limit his selection to retarded babies? Why not ugly babies? Or ugly adults? Or Jewish adults? Now, we see where Singer's perverted ""ethics"" can lead. At any rate, the worst (in the sense of most evil) would necessarily get on top. I urge everyone to read F.A. Hayek's masterpiece, ""The Road to Serfdom"" for the best and most thorough discussion of these issues."
1,Peter Singer is smoking crack.,"It's an amazing phenomenon...people so smart that they are stupid. Singer falls into that category, and I can't believe the influence this man wields. It's mind boggling. : / Read this to understand his influence in our time, yes. But don't be a sheep. This stuff is ridiculous."
4,New 3x5 Bennington (76) Flag American Revolution Flags,Love this product it hangs on my wall now it came quickly already ordered another flag from the same company
3,Nice flag but...,It looked great. But didn't last very long on the pole before it shredded at the ends. I'm very respectful when it comes to flying a flag and at the first sign of threads separating I change to a new flag. This flag lasted less then a month.
4,Good CD,A Fairly good GG Allin CD. Includes some bonus tracks as well as an 18 minute interview from GG while he was in prison for the infamous Ann Arbor incident. Worth buying.
5,"A must own,MTV puppets need not apply!!!","GG was and always will be Punk rock,if his great lyrics offend your little pc ears go listen to Blink 182 or something.It disgusts me when little MTV puppets judge GG,the man gave blood,sweat,sh-t,pi-ss and ultimately his life for the REAL underground scene.He will never be duplicated,as far as this album goes it is one of his best.If you dont have it buy it NOW.Anyone who feels otherwise Bite It You Scum!!!!"
5,GG Allin is the best underground punk artist ever!,"GG Allin would not be considered a artist by some... people who know nothing about punk and only listen to cd's titled ""Clasical Hits of Fantasia"" and ""Greatest Hitts of Barbara Strisand"" he was the king of his day, and all of underground punk! Screw anyone who says different!"
1,Ignorant,GG Allin is nothing that punk rock was or ever will be. He had no intellectual views and he was into rape and child molestation.
4,Tempered Steel: How God Shaped a Man's Heart Through Adversity,"I have ordered two books through Amazon and I am very pleased with both books. The books have came in very good shape and the price has been outstanding. I will be ordering more books, etc from Amazon.Thank you so very much.Helen R. Scherer"
4,Nice Product,"Works great - great sound quality. The only issue is that the speaker volume is not very loud, even at the highest setting.You have to buy your own power cord if you don't want to run if off batteries."
5,Great product,This Cd player is just what I need. Easy to operate and the sound is great. Its a bargain at the price.
1,Defective Product and No Help,"I had exactly the same experience as 'redrootoo' with the flashing display and the disc spinning and no sound coming out of my still under warranty unit. But here's the real rub -- there's no way to contact these folks. They don't answer their 800 number, their email feature requires a password, but there's no way to set one up and the info they give on the voice mail at their 800 number says to send the item back, but it doesn't give a return authorization number that the warranty and the website say you must include when returning an item! Talk about a Catch-22 situation! It is unconscionable."
2,Very sub par product,"The radio is not digital, but an old dial in mechanism. I missed that in the product description, if it was there. This kind of product is on it's way out, unfortunately,as I like the combo of the AM with the FM and the CD player. I never imagined it would still have the dial tune function. Not very durable, either. VERY DISAPPOINTING."
1,Awful,"Aside from having to keep track of the silly battery cap, the AC socket is too small and tight to accomodate a normal power adapter without forcing it in. My player would not run on batteries the day after I got it. The buttons are so small that they can be pressed only with a fingernail, and the PLAY and Stop buttons are virtually on top of each other. I returned the player for a refund."
4,Not too bad,CD player is ok. The external speaker could be louder but gee what do I want? Over all I like it!
1,Rubbish,"This product was flawed and a 'Total wast of time'I purchased it and the jwin 575 for somebody else as they wanted to listen to CD books without having to use headphones, it would Not function. Forget it! Save yourself a lot of trouble, and return costs."
2,"Don,t waste your money! This thing is junk",I really wouldn't waste my money on this pile of crap. the sound quality is poor and the batteries go dead fast and over all it is junk. When you listen to CDs the player better not be moving or it will skip and the external speakers are useless so like I said don't waste your money on this unit you will be disappointed.
3,"Great idea, mediocre execution.","Just a few days ago I was driving to work listening to Lateralus in my car and I was thinking how interesting it would sound to arrange some of the songs for a string quartet, so I was greatly suprised when I came across this very album at Barnes & Noble.While I think it's an excellent idea and I can think of few bands that would work better in this format, I was very disappointed in the execution. There just seemed to be very little... intensity. Listen to Ticks & Leeches for example, or the end of Schism--not to mention they skip my favorite section of The Patient. If you want to hear how much sonic ass a string quartet can kick, check out recordings by the Kronos Quartet. I would love to see what they could have done with this material."
5,What a Wonderful Gift!,"Flowers are nice but this book will be an enduring comfort to friends, family, co-workers & clients going through the grieving process. For those times when it's difficult to know what to say, the sensitive words and beautiful imagery in this book will be a blessing to all those dealing with the loss of a loved one."
2,Wheres the Bass?,"I think the bass, the instrument, should stand out more. During a lesson the instructor talks incessantly- over each note played. I would like to just hear the note. The talk could come before or after a run, not during. Picky, picky, picky."
1,Does NOT fit the Aiptek DZO-V38,I bought this for my camera (the Aiptek DZO-V38) and it's too freakin' big! I know it says it's for phones but in the description it says it's supposed to fit this camera AND THAT'S A LOAD OF CRAP!!!! So now I have wasted even MORE money buying this dang battery. I'm not happy at ALL!
2,Jim Dandy Fell Asleep.,"Truthfully, I do not know much about international economics, but after reading this book I know quite little more. It is not meant for the educated public (say someone with a doctorate in Psychology from Harvard.) It is written in that dreadful abstract and ultimately unclear social science jargon particular to each discipline's professional publications. What ever happened to good old clear, straight down-to-earth American prose ? I give the book two stars because it does seem to have a few interesting ideas, but I cannot go higher because in light of the prose the thoughts must be glimpsed as through a glass darkly."
3,Fun but Track Has Changed,"My son really likes this shed. The doors to shed open when you push the button above the shed, and it has a turn table that he likes a lot. However, we bought this so he could add on to all of the existing Take Along Thomas stuff that he has, but the track has been redesigned. The new track has a single round connector and is not compatible with the old track. We went to the store this morning and found some new track and an adapter that lets you connect to the old track, but it is a pain to have two different styles of track."
4,Nice Cart!,"I had trouble assembling it, but after struggling with it a bit (and using a soft mallet) it finally went together. It's a good card- solid construction, and the wheels are nice and sturdy."
4,Great little addition to my kitchen,"Workstation was delivered very fast. I could assemble it very easily without anyone's help. It's a great addition to my not so big kitchen, providing nice ""chopping"" surface and nice storage underneath. I gave it 4 stars out of 5 due to because it's not very sturdy, you have to watch it if you are moving it around frequently (like I do).."
4,Great mobile workstation!,"Once we got past the fact that it takes 2 people and some patience to put it together, we were really glad we made this purchase! We're using it to hold a countertop dishwasher and even loaded with dishes this is solid as a rock. This is good quality stainless steel, and the large wheels roll over the threshold to the pantry with ease. The shelving provides storage for dishtowels, soaps, etc. Again, not easy to put together but the end result is worth every dime!"
1,Hunk of Junk,"I was really excited for our new Kitchen Cart, but this thing was very disappointing. The top was dinged, the smell from the plastic was so bad it gave me a migraine, and there was some kind of sticky/slimy chemical residue all over the metal on the wheels. Those problems aside we were still willing to put it together and keep it, but on one of the tracks, the rings where the legs go through were welded too close together making it literally impossible to put it together unless we broke off the ring and re-welded it ourselves. The piece would have been very easy to put together if not defective like ours, but at least is was just as easy to disassemble and send back. Happy to be sending this back and getting a different cart all together."
4,"Great, but I should have bought the larger version (using for Beer Making)",As advertized. I use it for storing my beer making equipment. That being said i should have purchased the next larger size since I do not keep this in the kitchen. It does fit to fermenter/carboys side by side on the top (with fermentation locks) and on the bottom (without fermentation locks - for storage). As I mentioned the next size larger woudl have been better for me as I could have run more fermenters at once and had more storage space underneath for boxes and kegs (Cornelius).
3,Big,"I didn't see the dimension info for this product, It turned to be too big for my kitchen. Not for me"
3,Manufactured in Communist China,"The quality of this cart is reasonable.However, the stainless steel is not quite up to American standards.Considering its relatively low price, it's not a bad value."
4,like the product,"The first time I received this product parts were missing. I did a return and there was no charge for shipping and received the product the following week.Very easy to assemble, and a I love it for my kitchen this will be very handy,T.StOnge"
3,Not bad for the price,"I bought this for a microwave cart. It serves that purpose pretty well. It is a little rickety and there was a small dent in the top when I got it, but the microwave covers it."
4,Better Than Expected,"With most of the stainless kitchen carts I looked at costing upwards of $250, this one seemed too good to be true, but since I was looking for something to use on our patio as counter space next to a grill, I didn't want to to spend too much money. This one proved to be perfect, at least so far.Easy to assemble, it feels solid and rolls smoothly and easily. The top is heavy duty enough to feel like it wills stand up to (covered, protected) outdoor use and the entire surface is large enough to feel useful, yet not overly obtrusive.Honestly, for the price, I couldn't be more impressed. We will see how it holds up."
3,Works well enough...,"I was really excited about this workstation after reading some of the other reviews here. A few people thought this cart was restaurant quality.It's OK. I wanted something to put my microwave on in order to free some counter space. It is sturdy enought to safely and easily support the microwave. It is attractive and was easy to put together. It arrived very nicely packed and had no damage at all.So why only 3 stars? While the stainless steel top appears solid, it is really quite thin. Also, it shows fingerprints more than any other item I have come across. I have other stainless appliances, and they do not do this. I suppose it is worth $85, but just barely. I'm not thrilled, but I'm not returning it either."
4,High Quality product,"Very nice stainless steel appearance it looks just great, on top of being very functional and handy. Thumbs up for this one."
1,A Sad follow up to their 1st LP.,"When the Mamas and the Papas came out with this album, it was a sad follow up to their 1st. The only decent mix is the mono mix and this CD has the lousy stereo. ""I saw Her Again"" is not the single version but an extended version with filler music in the middle. ""Word Of Love"" is not the great single version with added orchestral music but a cheap sounding take that sounds incomplete. And other than a couple of covers, the rest of the music is a throw away. Their new Anthology 4 CD set has this album along with all their other albums on it and the songs have been remastered. As I type this, this CD is going for $87.00????? Get real sellers!!!"
3,"Solid and sturdy piece of equipment, but is too small","This piece of equipment is built very well. It's very heavy and sturdy and something you'd expect to find in a gym. It does not adjust to a good size for me, however, and I'm 6 ft tall, 180 lbs. I find it to be too small to get safely situated to do rigorous exercise."
3,Quality construction... good for back extensions... not good for traction,This is a very solid piece of equipment and perfect for doing back extensions. I bought it hoping to use it for traction but the position you are in while hanging does not allow your back muscles to relax so it won't work for traction.
5,Exact description,"Exactly as described, in original Simpson box with all paperwork. Lap belt fit well. I'm just waiting for it to save my life."
5,A Great Book,"I purchased this book for my 3 year old daughter for Christmas. It was one of two books that we had borrowed from the local library over the course of the year that we wanted to keep. (My wife tends to borrow about a dozen or two books a week as the library is right next to the preschool.) It was wonderful to provide my daughter with the chance to tell the story herself. The drawings and story line drew her in. The editorial reviews do a good job of describing the book, so I won't. This is one of two books out of the hundreds that we have borrowed that we elected to purchase, so my high rating isn't just inflated. (""The Lion and the Little Red Bird,"" by Elisa Kleven was the other.)"
5,Excellent Corded Replacement,"I have been able to retire my Skil Mag77. The circular saw in this kit has been used to cut studs, sheathing, rafters, engineered headers, 2x12's, and Advantec Flooring. Nothing seems to slow it down. Battery life seems to be about 3-4 times that of the 18V."
4,dewalt 36 volt kit,"this is an excellent product. with a crew of five, ( all own the dewalt 18 volt combo kits) everyone is using the 36 volt tools. they're just as light (or Heavy) as the 18 volt but with way more power, which is most noticeable in the drill and sidewinder saw. the 7-1/4"" blade in the sidewinder is good."
5,Dewalt DCX6401,Excellent tools! I use the reciprocating and circular saws for over two hours at a time and the batteries hold out that long without any problem. Less powerful than the corded ones but for most purposes I can use these cordless ones in a much convenient manner. So the trade-off is worth it.
1,To little too late dewalt!,"Be aware when buying these new packs that they do not offer any increase in run time over a standard ni-cd pack. Both are 2.4Ah which means they last the same amount of time, So dont be fooled by some people reviews of 75%-300% longer run times. The only advantage here is they are lighter than the old packs and have no memory affect. They should have bought these packs out when every other company bought theirs out 2 years ago. Also phosphate Lithium-ion is not the best cell type to be used in drills. It dont hold up to hard knocks very well so if you are prone to droping tools then be aware your cells in your pack may fail."
1,Buy Makita Lithium Ion,"All of the jobsites I go on I either fire up my generator or there is power already supplied. These 36volt tools are just too bulky and heavy. The drill is 6.9lbs compared to the Makita BHP451 at 4.9 lbs. I carry this thing around all day so to me that 2 lbs adds up to hundreds of lbs through the course of the day.The Makita engineers were genius's when they took the most popular cordless voltage and made it smaller, lighter, more comfortable, and more powerful than the leading competitors 18 volt. Makita's torque rating on the 18volt Lithium Ion drill and hammer drill spec out at 560 in. lbs. This 36v drill is rated for power by unit watts out (uwo), is dewalt trying to implement a new standard of rating fastening torque???? Interesting though, dewalt still rates the impact wrench(DC800KL) in ft-lbs. Makita is the way to go."
1,Pricey & Heavy Compared to Makita,"I agree with the previous poster about the weight issue here, at least in regards to a rotary drill (carpenters may well go for the extra power of Dewalt's circular saw though).I recently bought an 18V Makita lithium drill kit on eBay new for half of what DeWalt is asking for their new 36V kit and love it. Build quality on the Makita is superb and it's a full two pounds lighter than the Milwaukee lion drill. Interesting that DeWalt does NOT include the tool weight here, but I'd have to guess it's at least the 7 pounds that the Milwaukee 28V drill is, if not more. I have to think DeWalt is going to have a lot of trouble selling these for twice the price of the better-designed (IMO) and ergonomically superior Makita."
5,Powerful professional tool set,"This is one of the most powerful cordless tools I have used. The drill is excellent except for the chuck, which is sometimes hard on the hands when installing or removing a bit. I guess that's the price you pay for all that torque. I used it on a roofing job and it drove several hundred screws with no problem. The saw(s) are both terrific and as powerful as the drill. Watch the kick-back on the sawsall, because with all its power it kicks hard when hitting a nail or knot. And you can saw through wood with hidden nails with ease. Practicing a good technique is essential. When you respect its power, you can control it with ease, like a good horse. It recharges quickly and comes with two batteries. It is a bit heavy, but I would not give it up and would never go back to a lesser product. It is well made and takes a beating."
1,Dead Battery - Poor Customer Service,"Purchased this through work for field instrumentation installations. Set arrived with one dead battery. Called DeWalt and they referred me to the local service center in Huntington, WV. The individual I spoke with was less than interested in helping me. I decided to send it to the next closest center 60 miles away. Probably won't buy any more equipment from DeWalt."
5,I never knew it could be this easy!,"I would consider myself a novice in the area of programming, but this book has improved my knowledge exponentially! This is the go to book for anyone who is a novice, or a established professional in the field. Not since learning about my favorite inuit rapper, Glacia Kraze, have I been so excited about anything in my entire life. Definately check out this book if your interested in Java EE."
2,Chapters 1-8 good; Chapters 9-14 don't work,"This book was published too early. By that I mean, Java EE 5 was not finalized so the code examples starting in chapter 9 don't work. Another example is chapter 10 titled EJB Entity Beans. According to the Sun tutorial, Entity Beans have been replaced by the Java Persistence API."
2,Too much too fast!,"I bought this book to update my self on Java EE 5. However when I come to Chapter 9 and I try to run Jboss session bean samples it seems that things have changed since the moment they wrote the book. And I'm sure specification of EJB3 and JBOss will change until final realease.I wrote to the authors but I never had an answer to my questions, so it did the experiencie a little bit more frustrating.I learnt not to buy books of things under development!,"
2,Obsolete book,"I bought this book to learn the newer concepts introduced as part of Java EE 5. This book did'nt meet my expectations, the example code described in the book has already been deprecated and just don't work on Glassfish. The code on the book may be tested to use beta version of Java EE5 reference implementation ! I could'nt figure it out."
1,Bad,"I will never understand these 7+ minute remixes on latter Jamiroquai singles, they are looping, monotanous and bad. Also this cd cmes in the dreaded slipcase tray. Maybe they were good for early 90's dancefloors but now they are redundant. this single is no exception with 2 very long remixes and a radio edit of the title track. Would not recommend unless you are a completist, in which case get the 8track USA maxi release."
3,Subpar for Higgins,"Dark Justice is a book of unusual alliances. Central to the story is a jihadist group known as Wrath of Allah which receives financial and tactical support from Josef Belov, a Russian oligarch with strong ties to Russian intelligence. Aiding and abetting Belov are a group of IRA partisans. Point man for the elite counterterrorism unit whose mission it is to dismantle Wrath of Allah is Sean Dillon, once an IRA fighter himself and now one of Britain's ablest intelligence operatives.There's ample action and a fair amount of bloodshed as Sean Dillon does what needs to be done to neutralize his enemies, some of whom are his former IRA friends. Unfortunately, the plot to Dark Justice is very flimsy. The various characters do things seemingly at random and with little or no rationale to justify all the mayhem.A weak effort from an author capable of much better. As has already been observed, Higgins appears to have phoned this one in. Not recommended."
1,THE LITERARY EQUIVALENT OF PAINTING BY NUMBERS,"Buyer beware, this is how a lazy writer gets his money. If it took Jack Higgins longer to write than me to read I doubt there was much in it. To cap it all, he lives tax-free on Jersey, so he really is having his cake and eating it."
3,"If you like Higgins, it's a nice read","Jack Higgins has a long list of great novels behind him. His last few however, while competent, have lacked the genius of the earlier Higgins.For a regular Higgins reader, which I am, the characters of Sean Dillon, Ferguson and the others are familiar: increasingly so. The plot flows smoothly, but again all too similar to earlier novels with the same characters.All that said and done, for a Higgins fan, ""Dark Justice"" is still an entertaining read, but nothing more.Jerry"
3,Who in the math wizard had this book frist,Okay first off let me say a big kudos to your for getting this to me extremely fast. For that I am grateful. But wowsers whoever read or owned this must have loved 2 things math and Cheetos cause the whole 2 back pages are covered in math formulas and equations of some sort. Then there were Cheetos' finger marks on about 1/4 or so of the pages.
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY,"I haven't read a Jack Higgins novel in years, but I enjoyed them, as I remember. It will be much longer before I read another. Other reviewers will give you a summary of the ""plot"". The author has gotten incredibly lazy. One of the disadvantages of the computer era is the ""Copy and Paste"" feature on a word processing program, at least as far as novels are concerned. The dialog was repetetive in ""Dark Justice"". I never want to read the phrase ""six pounds of gray ash"" again and again and again. The author should also realize that there is no such thing as a ""sergeant major"" in the US armed forces. I could go on and on with flaws. The purpose of a thriller genre novel is to give at least a sense of realism. Sadly lacking in this case."
1,If I could give it zero I would,"The plot is basic, involving trips to Iraq, London and Ireland.The book is full of 2-dimensional characters that you don't care for. The dialog is lacklustre; the ""action"" is simplistic and by-the-numbers. Even the grand finale is over in a few pages.Dillon runs around the world saving everybody except the US president. There's nothing ""thrilling"" about this story at all.I wouldn't have believed it was a Jack Higgins book if it didn't have the name on the front cover.Don't waste your money."
3,"Fast, Fast Read","Whenever I want an exciting, fast read I turn to Jack Higgins. All the old crew is here, especially Dillon. I like this a lot, but I get the feeling all the main characters are getting a little long in the tooth! They sound as if ""nothing gets better, no matter how much we try"". This book dealt with the dark side of Islam and was much too real for me.Yes, it was exciting and if only the bad guys were stopped as quickly and efficiently as Sean Dillon made it feel. He is one superdude. Ususally authors take hundered of pages to conclude a book. Higgins took 23 pages!But I love the guy anyway. I couldnt put the book down and managed to suspend today's reality for a short time."
3,Not quite the same,"Love all the main characters. Have now read 24 or all his books. Like others I feel something is missing. Maybe all have been written that there is. Don't know but if there can be no more it has been a good run and worth reading some again. I wouldn't try to continue when I am done, if I am. Sugar Ray Leonard would attest to that. I hope there can be more but only as good as the earlier novels were."
5,Buy this book!,"Whether you are a student, a professional, or just enjoy writing for fun, you must buy this book! Dolan covers almost every possible aspect of writing, from essays to resumes, letters to brochures (even though he suggests paying a pro to create your brochure). My personal favorite is Chapter 11-""Sensible Mechanics Without a Bunch of Useless Theories and Rules."" This book is a great tool to get you through those tough college courses, or just to use for reference."
4,Better than most,I never knew a writing book could be fun to read. The author has a simple sense of humor that keeps things working. At first I didn't believe there was such a thing as his universal format for writing anything. But now I see how it works.I really got something I could use with my memos.Some of the exercises were a little weird. But you don't have to do them. I liked the cartoons too.
1,Now way,"Received an email not specific to my purchase to call the vendor. I reluctantly called them and after they finally found the order they said the AA I ordered was out of stock. I informed them that my order was for AAA batteries. I simply told them to cancel the order on the item they didn't have. I had to call back again to actually get the order cancelled and then a third time to get a refund since they hard charged me for this item they did not have. I finally did get this cleared up, but not without the hastle."
4,A little pricey,"It's an excellent product, but it's a little pricey, considering that I purchased an 8-pack of AA batteries of the same kind, with a lower price"
4,The candid and honest Harry Truman,"Despite a great deal of opposition, Harry Truman was the President most responsible for winning the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union. His aid to European nations devastated by the war kept them from being taken over by Communists and his firm stance in Korea led to the victory disguised as a stalemate.Harry was a cantankerous man who spoke his mind, and several pieces of it appear in this short book. His honesty was under appreciated at the time, yet he never lost focus on what he was and what he stood for. I consider Truman to have been one of the five best U. S. presidents of all time and he also was close to the most candid. While the greatness is not readily apparent in this book, his candid nature is."
5,A man with a dark past and a girl half his age...,"No, it's not a episode of Buffy, its the second book of Suki. In volume two we learn that Asou has a job after school, is a bad person and is just as determined to be close to Hina as she is to be as close to him. But there are different reasons. Is she falling in love with him? And what's his job after work if he's spending so much time with HER? Who is Tomo-Kun and Kizu-San? Why are they watching and why does Tomo-Kun think Hina is good for Asou? I've got to get volume three!"
2,Generic!,Every 30 minutes an overweight Mexican is killed by a deranged doll. This is a lame rip off of the Child's Play / Chucky series. If a horror movie is going to have so few kills they need to be good kills. The ones in Dolly Dearest are weak.
3,"Not enough gore, not as fun as chucky",While watching the movie the vibe was quit creepy but the gore was limited.this film is not as fun to watch as the childs play series. I would say just rent it. Dont waste the money on purchasing it
3,Hmmm,"I really don't know what to say, the movie was defintely wonderful and yet easy to scorn at the same time. The plot and scripting are ridiculous, unbelieveable fluff. The acting is the standard horror movie type -- the acting people who got a role in a low-cost flick and were never seen again. However, the movie is fairly good. It has some low-grade action & suspense but Child's Play is easily much better. This movie, to its credit, was the victim of production in early 1990's, when SFX were less advanced. If the movie were remade today, it'd probably be much more than a three-stars average flick. It does shine in some parts - the Jessica / dollhouse scene is great, the Housemaid's killing is sad but brutally gory, and the rest of the film is a bit weak and struggles along to support a weak plot.Maybe you should rent it, but don't buy it!"
3,Doll movies,i have liked this movie since i was a child some habits die hard and mine is horror movies and vampire movies I like most doll horror films. i do not know why they have just always caught my attention. it isn't the best horror film but it is one that i enjoy. Dolls is also good if u like this movie.
2,copy of chucky,"this is like chucky, but just a girl doll that really is the devil and tried to kill this little girl. Corny and stupid effects on killing and i could ask for better. The only difference frok chucky is that there are lots of these dolls that are idenical, (unlike Demonic Toys), and man are they ugly!!!!"
4,bolly dearest meets chucky,"I have to say i watched this as a kid...i did compare it to chucky a lot. But this movie is a good creep film. If you like freaky little things trying to kill you, you will love this. I do recommend this film. It seemed to stick in my head through child hood so maybe it will do the same for you. Maybe it's worth remembering more then you think."
3,CHUCKY IN A DRESS,"The comparisons to CHILD'S PLAY are unavoidable, but this little sleeper from 1992 still has some good moments. An archaeologist releases the spirit of a devil child which immediately possesses one of the pretty little dolls in Daddy's new doll factory. Daddy's little girl Jessica falls in love with the doll and it isn't too long that we know the little Dolly has possessed the little girl.The lovely Denise Crosby does a good job as the distraught mother and Rip Torn is effective as another archaeologist. Sam Bottoms doesn't get to do as much but he is okay.While quite tame by today's standards, DOLLY DEAREST is a tidy little shocker."
1,Didnt really like this film,"Ugh this film was bad, The story line was weak and it was predictable and cheesy, It wasnt scary at all. I wouldnt recommend this film."
5,Amazing!!,"This CD captures Cappuccilli at this finest. Such a great exponent of fine Verdian singing we hear so little of these days. Truly a magnificent voice, and artist. One of my favorite baritone CD's of all time. BRAVO"
3,got wrong thing?,I ordered two different sizes of my favorite perfume which in general I would rate as 5 star+. I love this product but when I received them the small bottle was correct but the larger bottle came in different packaging and didn't smell quite the same so because of that I was very disappointed.
3,buena,buena fragancia aunque no viene en la misma presentacion que se muestra en la imagen aunque ellos indican que el embalaje debe cambiar deberia mantener por lo menos algun empaque similar
5,like a house on fire,"Fire and water, angels and demons, an irresistible desire to soar above the reality - all this is implemented in the fantasies of Givenchy. In all that makes Givenchy, read his nobility and breed, which can give elegance even the usual jeans with a sweater."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!,Horrible quality! I followed the installation instructions to the letter. The sound of this WEAK horn is more lame than the one it is replacing. I SHOULD have returned it but that's my bad. It's in the trash for sure!
2,"With the provided compressor, the horn is useless.","The horn is not loud at all when hooked up to the provided compressor. However, when you use more air pressure, the horn is really loud and has a good echo of a real train horn. If I had it to do over, I would definitely not buy this product, spend a little extra money and get one that works great."
2,Beautiful but not loud,"Installation of this air horn took few hours. This horn not loud at all. I have installed it to my SUV as a second horn to wake up some retards on the road, but my factory horn is louder than wolo air horn. It needs more powerfull air pump to produce more air pressure to that horn. One more detail, air tank made from plastic."
5,Excellent surgical atlas,The second edition of the shoulder text reaffirms the overall excellent quality of this series. The editor has assembled a who's who of shoulder experts to breakdown complex issues regarding pathologic conditions of the shoulder with straightforward surgical management algorithms and complementary pictures and diagrams. An increased focus on arthroscopic techniques mirrors the current skills required by today's shoulder surgeons and is certainly welcomed by the reader.
1,disappointed,The chairs are falling apart after 3 years. I don't see how they can say this set is build for longevity.
4,I Would Buy This Again,"This is not flimsy which was one of my first concerns. This also has a good quality rubber which was my second worry. The third worry was the operation of the ratchet mechanism. This thing locks only when you give one to three yanks - on average. The instructions are minimum and you have to look hard for the way to increase the spring tension, but that you only do once. When you are done hanging this thing it rocks."
4,Visit GG Allin's craziness,"Thank God this album is so short, if it were any longer there would be the very real threat that you would never emerge from GG's Crazyland. Enjoy his sick genius, visit this album, just make sure you can find your way back out again."
3,Ravings of Music's Last Great Hope,"Granted, this is not Allin's best release, but it is one that gives the chaos inside his mind a voice (and soundtrack by Shrinkwrap). And yes, the spoken word bit is recycled, but the music gives it new life.Allin's thoughts are laid bare here, and while it's not surprising, it does give those who don't know anything about him a place to start (and I recommend reading the CD insert, too). I knew the man -- this is pretty right on.Allin was many things to many people, but one fact that can't be disputed is that he really was music's last great hope. He set out to destroy convention and make rock 'n' roll dangerous again, and he succeeded. Sure, parents got scared of Mr. Manson and the image he changed more than Madonna, but that's because they never heard Allin. Get this CD and get acquainted with the last true master of rock."
1,Uggghhhh!!!!!,"This is NOT a recommended G.G. Allin album. All they did was recycle the spoken word from G.G. Allin & Anti-Seen's Murder Junkies and have a second rate band play and scream in the background. I was hoping for some original G.G., but didn't get it with this album. Definately NOT recommended to even the most diehard G.G. fan."
4,"no specific instructions, but good tips and tricks","This book is a quick read and certainly recommended to anyone considering taking up the daunting task of getting a PhD. It is not the book, that will give you specific instructions on what you need to do to get a PhD (there aren't any), but it does give you a heads up on some challenges (e.g. feeling of failure) you will face as well as some tips and tricks (e.g. managing your supervisor) that you can apply along the way."
1,very poor service,They sent an old edition of the book to me and simply didn't reply my complaint afterwards!!!
2,"Wizard How to Draw: Vol 2, not could be Vol 1 and 1/3","Is This the Book 2??Is this a joke from the Joker???Oh please give me a break. . It looks like 1 and 1/3 Volume. My first impression was ""I want my money back!!!"". This book essentially is a reprise from the first edition. Here we have the same problem with DC's characters, They are still out... It's a fail, we will not read again ""how to draw batman"", ""Superman"", ""how to draw supporting characters"" or any trainings with DC Characters.. It's bad for us the DC's fans. !!Anatomy here, oh please you can find this info in the first volume. Hey there are no signal about ""Krash Course"" authored by Greg Capullo ""Vicious Anatomy"".Hey Wizard: Bring Back Greg Capullo's KRASH COURSE!!!Not at all is bad here. There are several articles authored by Brian Bolland, Eyes, Noses and Mouths. Brian Bolland is the Pinnacle here."
5,A Memory of Love,"'""Why won't you believe me?"" Her nave stitched into her parka and an address on a piece of paper identified the pretty young amnesia victim-and led her to the man was her husband.Dixon Cabot was anything but happy to see her. What had she done to make him so cold and unbelieving, she wondered. In the haze that blanketed her mind, Adele Cabot was sure of only one thing-her husband did not love her.'"
1,Geographically challenged,"It's a decent color, not a bad looking design, and it's on sale right now for an excellent price, and I'm a huge Georgia Tech fan (CS '01), but I will not be buying one of these shirts.Why not? Take a look at the rest of the shirts in this series. They've got the Michigan logo in Ann Arbor. They've got the Penn State logo in State College. They've got the Wisconsin logo in Madison.They put the Georgia Tech logo in Athens."
5,Great Burner - Very Strong and Sturdy,"I have been a little disappointed in the Broilmaster original burners. They come with a 15year pro-rated warranty but I've had two burners rust out over 12 years. Instead of getting another one I wanted to try this one made by Music City Metals.So far I am very impressed. Upon receiving it, you will notice that is built to last. It is far heavier and made of thicker metal which will be much less likely to rust. Installation was a breeze, but if you're looking for written directions you may as well go elsewhere as there was nothing in the packaging to help. It takes two people to install so you can line up the gas lines just right. Once in place it is a perfect fit for my D3 grill.Read this knowing that I haven't cooked with it yet, this pertains to first impressions and installation -- I've started the burner and let it get hot and it was almost as hot as the original burner. I'll edit my review after I've cooked a few steaks and fill in those blanks."
3,eh...,"Its ok for a first timer, but if you want to cut alot of glass for and last a long time try another one."
5,"Open Home, Open Life","A very moving and challenging story of a woman and man sold out for God. Fascinating - especially the account of the months they held ""Open House"" in China in order to prove that they didn't pickle and eat babies, and of the thousands of visitors who passed through their home at that time."
4,Cool Underground Salsa,Yellow Fever captures the best of Latin and Garage music - think the Hives meets Ricky Martin... Recommended!
4,Great album!,This album is really great! You really should listen to it. Buy it now! You won't regret it. German fan.
4,Practical Twin Interviews are Interesting Read,"From a mother of 4 year old boy/girl twins... I read this book cover to cover when I was expecting. I felt that the interviews really provided very good insight into what it felt like to be a ""twin"" and brought up some interesting issues that I had not considered (ie - how to dress, how to help them be individual, etc). I thought it was very good - and entertaining. If you are an experienced mother, then most twin books will not be that useful. The best thing to do is join a twin club and get your practical advice from other parents - as the issues at each developmental stage are soo different. The reality is that there isn't a practical guide out there that really will spell it all out for you... and we are still learning.. Even ""twins"" can't be classified.Have fun !"
2,Very Basic,"This book is very good if you know absolutely nothing about twins. It is very broad in its scope. So, if you are looking for general information about twins from conception through adulthood this book is a good overview. If you are looking for specific knowledge about the care of twin infants/babies/toddlers - get a different book."
2,not illuminating,I have 3.5 yr old fraternal twin girls and there wasn't anything partuicularly unique or interesting in this book. I have yet to find an illuminating book about raising healthy twins and the unique challenges of two siblings the exact same age.
2,A little disapointing......,I was really hoping for more practicle and applicable advise on how to ensure by boys thrive in spite of/because of their twinship. I found this book weak on infomation about those critical infant/toddler developmental years. The twin interviews were good reading but not enlightening for me. I hoped this would serve as a reference I could use for years to come - so far its a dust collector.
2,Not for the casual fan,"While Badley raises a few interesting points, she takes the literature far too seriously and will lose many readers because of her writing style, which is too heavy with academia. She also seems to have a feminist axe to grind, as she spends a great deal of space writing about feminist elements in the authors' work.I would recommend looking for this at the library if you feel you must read it. There's not enough here to merit the cover price."
1,hummingbirds!beauty and the beast,Noticed article in local newspaper about a hummingbird video. It sounded like a great gift. Bought two for Christmas gifts don't waste your money not a well made tape.
4,check your expectations at the door,"I think the only thing that could ruin this book is wrong expectations. I came into it thinking ""Ooh a book by Cher's daughter! Cher is God so I should read it!"" and when I found out it was about her lover Joan's battle with cancer I was like, ""Aw, sad! This is gonna be depressing!""neither expectation proved true!By the end of the book I not only did I have a deep respect for Chastity Bono as her own person, not just Cher's daughter, but I was deeply inspired by the story and life of Joan! The book is really a very inspiring tale of love and life and everday, universal struggles (despite the fact its mainly about fame, the music industry, battles with cancer, and the struggles of lesbians). Its really a very triumphant book whose only fault is the fact that it was written by someone so young so the ending comes all too soon. I hope for a sequel!"
4,"Goodbye, Chuck Jones.","A SALUTE TO CHUCK JONES is a great tape from Warner Brothers' 24 Karat Gold Collection. Sadly, Chuck Jones passed away on February 22, 2002. He was a great animator. This collection includes all of his best cartoons. DUCK DODGERS IN THE 24TH AND 1/2 CENTURY (1953) is one of Daffy Duck and Porky Pig's best. ONE FROGGY EVENING (1955) is certainly a classic cartoon. One of the best remembered cartoons. RABBIT SEASONING (1953) is a great Elmer Fudd/Bugs Bunny/Daffy Duck cartoon. HIGH NOTE (1960) includes little dialogue but is very funny. ZOOM AND BORED (1957) has some very original ideas and gags. This is the only Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote cartoon on this tape. Too bad, because those are his best characters. I'd say this tape is great for any Chuck Jones fan. I recommed this. Goodbye, Chuck Jones."
5,Is he the latest Jim Morrison....?,"Here's the deal: Roger Clyne is a musical genius. Period. the gent who said the AZ Peacemakers are past their prime is nuts. Period. If you like music live - go see, or at least listen to Roger and the band (see mp3.com)...very talented, very good, very funny, very thought provoking. Don't try to put them in a category, it ain't gonna happen. Perhaps, in a perfect world, they would be better off on CMT or the CMA Awards - they certainly do it better than most on there today...To the band-bring the show to the east, and don't sell out for people like the one up above me on this page. Tip the bottle & bite the lime.All weather-Cowboy Up-Dick"
4,Another solid effort,"This is one of the great regional bands in the U.S., a great Arizona act that reminds me of the Gin Blossoms."
3,So So,"I'm a long time Refreshments and Roger Clyne fan, this isn't may favorite. But I'm loyal, I get them all, I'll occasionally take a listen and remember that it's just ok for me. I recommend adding it to your collection to hear their different style on this, but that's about it."
2,Music is good but the disc is a shameless ploy to sell the songs and ringtones!,"I bought this DVD because I like Bollywood movie dance numbers. I was very disappointed at this DVD because every song has large white letters on the top of the widescreen video box that state ""dial xxx to download this ringtone"" and then after that a message telling you what to dial to download the song. It's filmed in widescreen, but the large white letters that appear for many seconds, several times during the course of each song are very distracting and really take away from the enjoyment of this disc and the music. It's also done in an MTV-like format, where at the beginning of each song a block comes up telling you what song it is. I find that a bit distracting too. I bought a couple other Bollywood dance number DVDs and they didn't have the same problem. I can enjoy them 100%. Unfortunately the same is not true of this disc. I would give the music itself 4 stars, but the sales-push ruins it for me."
1,Just as bad as the movie.....,GG Allin needed help when he was alive and this album (soundtrack to the movie of the same name) is just plain stupid. At least whole watching the film you can bypass the music becouse you are so mezmerized by the sickness of this man.Here are a few reasons to but this album.1. CD's make better coasters.2. You want to play it at a party that you never want these people to come over you'r house agian.3.You want to hear just how bad someone can butcher a Warren Zevon song.4. You really didn't listen to the music the first time and you want to see if it is that bad.5. You have just stopped taking you'r medication.
1,Anybody know what's going on with this edition?,"I refuse to pay over $400 for a used hardback edition! These are 3 great ""bands,"" but why do I suspect that this more affordable edition is being held back just to increase the collector's value of the hardbound edition? Collector scum really piss me off!"
4,Wonderful but rare video,I saw this in 1992 and it is a beautiful production. I only wish I could find it in a digital format!
3,small size is great,ever vehicle should have one from factory i have a friend who lost thier smallo daughter while campin she was back over and killoed this tragity could have be averted with one of these i feel safer and a better conciensus driver with this device
3,Is all terrorism like the Basque nationalists?,"This book started out as a good overview of terrorism. How words will define the reality of a situation, how terrorism depends on the media for the terror effect, how terrorist attacks are random while still having a target, and a fairly good discussion of how terrorism is defined. However, at about the halfway point, the book became too focused towards the ETA, a terrorist organization supporting Basque nationalists. This book went from a discussion of terrorism, to a discussion of how the police were abusing their power while trying to fight the ETA. I suppose it covered the topic well, but it was annoying because I wanted a book on terrorism in general, not a book about the ETA and the police."
1,"Dont waste your time, any van dame's movie is better 4 that","A history seen so many times but with diferent faces... I saw it and its even anoying; the same cliches from begining to end... if you see it, you will feel angry at the end. I dont give it a single star but amazon makes me put at least one... Just for Roddy McDowall die hard fans"
5,haunting and so lovely,"I have been a longtime fan of Flynn's and it's so wonderful to have a CD of his music at last! It glues itself to the back of your mind. Hauntingly beautiful. And, I'm so glad ""Stitches"" has two versions-- words or not words, depending on what you prefer."
3,Not an introduction to the subject,"I bought this book looking for a beginning text on COM and ATL 3. I know this is in Wrox's ""Professional"" series but the back of the book claims it is suitable as an introduction to ATL/COM for the experienced Visual C++ programmer. Also, neither of Wrox's ATL/COM ""Beginning"" books covers ATL 3. Well, It proved to be a very poor introduction. I was overloaded with details from the first few pages of the book and ended up absorbing little until I gave up. A coworker of mine had the same complaint.I've since read Inside COM (which is a good introduction) and done some COM programming. Now I use Professional COM/ATL as a reference and it is a good book in that regard. It contains the best coverage I've found for using MTS and MSMQ in C++.So if you use this book as a reference and to get pieces of information as you need it, you'll probably find it pretty good. But if you try to read it straight through as a learning tool you're likely to be frustrated."
2,Very hard to read and understand due to poor writting skills,"The book contains grammar errors, inconsistencies, and incorrect function names (DoCreateInstance) which make a complex topic even more confusing. Also, the book is worded poorly and written in a very unclear manor which makes it hard to understand. After reading four chapters in this book, read some chapters in a MS Press book on a similar topic, and the difference in readability was very obvious. When a technical book contains these types of errors, it makes the reader lose credibility for the authors. It makes one wonder, if they have errors in their documentation, do they also have errors in their instructions?"
4,mailed quickly,"Bought this as a return for a lost library book; searched under hardback, somehow this came up, purchased it and it was soft back. Good condition though and it shipped quickly. Great price."
2,Not a how to as much as a general list of hotels by city,"This book is a sample of European destinations and what appear to be hostels for travelers in their twenties. Its spread very thin because it covers traveling in alot of countries. I found it to be like a sampler plate in a restaurant, a little bit of lots of things. If you are looking for a book that tells you how to travel cheaply, reduce airfare, rental car costs, as well as where and how to look for lodging, don't buy this book."
5,"Love, love, love this ring!",I get SO many compliments on this ring. A friend asked if I would mind if she bought the same ring. Of course I didn't mind and now she has one too. It's beautiful and just the right size-I was looking for a narrow band type ring for my thumb. LOVE IT~
4,Really good movie.,Really good movie. Seen it several times and it's always enjoyable to watch. Highly recommend this movie to one and all.
2,"Trying to capture the film student experience, and failing miserably","This film is sustained by cliches and presumptions that drive an unremarkable and unbelievable plot. The best part by far is the beginning of the film, which is actually quite good, giving a good portrayal of student films and filmmakers. However, from that point on, it becomes tired and uninteresting, a waste of time and talent."
5,Overlooked Classic,"This little gem is overlooked in the repertoire of Christopher Guest films, like ""Best in Show."" Fun movie, especially for those who enjoy a [clean] satire on the foibles of Hollywood."
4,An Strong Funny Spoof on Hollywood.,"Wehn a Young Filmmaker (Kevin Bacon) win a Prize for his Short Bizarre Film. When he`s about to go Big Time in the Film Industry but He finds Himself thoroughly Corrupted by the Temtpations of Hollywood.Directed by Christopher Guest (Waiting for Guffman, Almost Heroes, Best in Show) is a Clever, Well-Written Satire. Guest Co-Written the film with actor:Micheal McKean-Who has a Supporting Role. The Film`s Stand-Out (Cameo) Performance in this, is from Actor:Martin Short as a Wacked-Out Agent. This Extremely Underrated Comedy has become a Cult Classic. A Well Made Film. Grade:A-."
2,An unwelcome Guest,"I'm a huge fan of Christopher Guest's brilliant troika of mockumentaries - Spinal Tap, Waiting For Guffman and Best In Show. Unfortunately, this doesn't even get close to those movies in humour or performance. Kevin Bacon looks constantly bemused, Michael McKean embarrassed and JT Walsh can't wait to get off camera. Robert Altman did this so much better with ""The Player"", while this tries to satirise Hollywood but just ends up mis-firing.I gave one star for Martin Short's over the top performance and one, cause heck, I still like Mr Guest."
3,"I'd heard about this movie for years, but...","When this movie came on, I started out hating it, mainly due to the annoying theme/background music, but as the movie progressed I tried to ignore the music and grew to enjoy the movie's largely realistic depiction of Hollywood. ""The Big Picture"" was very funny -- in spurts, but the ending did seem contrived. Many of the fantasy sequences (aside from the ones concerning how Nick saw his movie in his head) were silly and gave the movie a ""cutesy"" tone that set my teeth on edge."
3,very 80's...but Guest's subtle humor is still there!,"If you are a Christopher Guest fan,you've got to see it. I think his humor is awesome! Not a great show. not anywhere in the same league as Spinal Tap, Best In Show, and Guffman, but still good."
5,This satirical look at the world of hollywood..,"will keep you in stitches. As you follow Kevin Bacon's character through the topsy turvy world of Hollywood, you will learn to appreciate the crazy world of La La Land. Kevin Bacon proves once again to be a truly great actor. Things to look for include a small by FABULOUS spot by Fran Drescher (of The Nanny fame) and Teri Hatcher (of Lois & Clark fame) who plays a slutty actress sleeping her way to the top. You will be hysterical at Teri's huge hair! It's way bigger than the queen of queens' who coined the phrase ""The bigger the hair, the smaller the hips look."" Fran deserves a 5 min oscar for this role as well."
5,I'd Like to Thank My Grilled Cheese Sandwich.,"For anyone that hasn't seen this movie, I highly recommend it. ""The Big Picture"" is simultaneously a parody of the movie business and the real story of how much luck and chance are involved in being successful in that business. Probably the best part of the story is towards the end, when Kevin Bacon's character makes his comeback (without even knowing it). I won't give too much away, but suffice it to say, a grilled cheese sandwich really can turn your directing career around."
3,Good service,"I purchased ten batteries. The batteries are functional properly. However, no clear manufacturer labels and some of them have recharge problems."
2,Tracfone battery,"Service quick, bought 2 replacement batteries based on other reviews. Phone still wouldn't take a charge. Bought a new phone. Skip the batteries and buy a new phone instead."
3,Nokia Li-battery,"The prev. battery came with Nokia phone and lasted for about 2+ years. This one is ""so far so good"" and I hope will last for sometime."
3,Not as good as original battery,"This is also a replacement battery for a Nokia TracFone. My old battery, when new, would last about 2 weeks on standby. The new battery I ordered can barely last a week. I have no complaint with the transaction otherwise."
4,Finally got what I ordered,"The first battery I was sent arrived in a padded envelope. Not wrapped, no receipt, nothing except the battery. Tried it in my phone & it did not hold a charge.Wrote a scathing report on the web site. Received an email from a stranger talking about my battery & wanting me to remove my report IMMEDIATELY. Told him I would take it down as soon as I received a NEW battery. This one at least came in a plastic bag.So far it is working great."
1,"Silly, sloppy, and snooty","There is a little bit of good stuff in the book, granted, but it's hard to find and it's not nearly enough--there are gaping holes in information and what is there is organized poorly and not logically (I had to keep flipping back and forth through the book to find what I was looking for). I'm a seasoned Windows user and was looking for something that would help me learn the differences and new features of XP vs. previous versions...but I might just as well have saved my money and used the XP Help files to learn. The author tries to be funny or cute and ends up just sounding silly instead, and sometimes the jokes or comments are condescending as well. If you're looking for a helpful, informative, interesting book that will help you learn how to use XP, this is NOT it."
1,Clicking on Help is cheaper,I didn'd find anything in this book that I could not find in the Windows HELP file that comes with XPtom
3,it is not for everyone,"Despite charles manson is the one singing and playing guitar on this record, the music is somewhat strange, there is not a connection between the songs and the man who sings them except for mechanical man and ego.But after all it is a good record for people who love the spirit of the sixties, a little distortioned of course."
2,If I had to do it all over again....,"This CD was rather boring..But as a fan of stuff you might not see everyday I thought it would be good to have...If I had listened to it before I paid for it I probably would not have got it,but now that I have it I do listen to it every few months..I often find myself singing ""Garbage Dump""..Listen to it first,before you waste your money.."
3,Suprisingly Lucid Music From a Mad Man,"Whatever Charles Manson has a hard time communicating to us with his words, he seems to get it out better through music. As someone only familiar with the ""Helter Skelter"" Charles Manson, I was very suprised at how pop-ish his music was. Not to mention that Charlie has a fine singing voice as well.Some of these songs would not be out of place on an FM oldies station. It would be interesting to slip some of these tracks into a station's rotation, and have people guess who it is."
3,What a nut,This guy is a true nut. Great music by a complete nut!!!!Manson was a great singer that is all but forgotten about today
1,"I gotta go along with ""MEWZIK"" on this one!","Did ""MEWZIK"" say something about, they should cut off Manson's hands and vocal cords, considering what he had his people do to others who had even more talent (i.e., Sharon Tate)... OK, I'll go along with that. Anyone else in favor, let's get together and suggest that to the authorities. From what little I've previewed of this CD, that beast had little or no talent...and it's on an audio CD???? Hell, if I'd known that it was THAT easy to release an audio CD of that low of quality and talent...I myself would have done so a long time ago!!If you're not in your right mind, you might actually enjoy this CD. If you are in your right mind...you'll probably agree with ""MEWZIK"" and myself.Oh well...for what that was worth...That and about $1.48 might get you a cheap cup of coffee these days..."
1,a bad bad man,Musically on a level with Lou Reed's Metal Machine Music.I have both of these but can't stand either one for more than a minute.This is one of those albums that for lack of a better term develops a cult (ooh sorry 'bout that) and unfortunately some people will buy anything.You may now proceed to The Shaggs.
3,The Man can't keep his music down.,"Although he gained fame as a cult leader and convicted felon, few know of the sensitive side of Charles Manson. This CD highlights Charles Manson the singer songwriter whose songs were recorded by such diverse artists as Guns n' Roses, Redd Kross, and the Beach Boys."
5,Who would have guessed...............,"This is a book of faith for Christians, for Non-Christians, for people of Faith, for people searching for Faith.I've always enjoyed reading former North Dakota farm boy turned human rights leader Patrick Atkinson's works, and though I know him only through his monthly newsletter, I thought I knew him pretty well. In this Faith book, however, there's an intimate and maybe sad side in him that I've only now discovered. When I accepted Christ into my own life, I knew I would suffer for my beliefs. At least, I HOPED I would suffer. Otherwise, how would I know if my beliefs were real or not? This book helped me answer that ""Is it real"" question by letting me vicariously live the challenges these inspirational men and women of faith had to answer for their own questions."
4,Great Value,"This Dispenser is well made and just as good as many higher priced products. The only problem I have with it it is the plastic pour spout can be a little bit of a challenge to get in once you have taken it out to clean or fill it, it's not impossible but it's not easy either."
2,Cheaper looking than originally thought,"I was surprised to find that Amazon listed Kenneth Cole shoes at a such a minimal price, so I snapped these up immediately. Ultimately, however, I found that the pictures on the site did not do the best job in relaying how old-fashioned these shoes look.I have worn two or three pairs of Kenneth Cole shoes, and I thought I understood that Kenneth Cole was a modern, trendy designer. Not so with these shoes - they are a bulky and not much different than George-branded shoes I could find at the nearest Walmart.I understand that style and fashion are very subjective to the wearer, but these shoes didn't look nearly as good as what I would expect from Kenneth Cole. Pass these on by."
2,Buyer beware,"These are probably the most rigid, uncomfortable shoes I've ever bought. Everything feels like it's made of a hard plastic rather than leather. I consider myself to be a pretty shrewd consumer, but this definitely was not one of my finer moments. In fact, from now on I'm going to buy 100% of my shoes in person- they may cost twice as much, but at least you know exactly how they fit and what you're getting into.The only reason why I didn't give them one star is because I only paid $40, including tax and shipping. It could have been a lot worse, I suppose."
3,Mislead,"Make sure you know you are only receiving 1 deck of cards. The pictures show 2 decks, and because other websites sell 'dual decks' of kem cards, this item on amazon has a misleading picture. I did however receive my shipment promptly."
3,OK but could use a better tread,These are comfortable shoes and do fit good all around but the vendor could have but a more deeper tread on them for a better grip on trail walks.
2,Defective Left shoe?,"I ordered these shoes because I work in a hospital and stand for 6+ hours every day. When I got them, the right shoe fit great but the left shoe seemed to have a hard, plastic bump on the inside left side. I tried to just wear them to stretch them out, but it just hurt too much. i've read other reviews that said the quality of these shoes has recently gone downhill because a new company bought them out :( farewell, $70. i would recommend getting the Wide size instead of normal."
3,Merrell Jungle Moc review,I have purchased several pair of Merrell shoes the past few years. They have all been the slid on clog type and are very comfortable. The Jungle mocs are a slip on type and they run a little short and cramp my toes. Not as comfortable as the others.
2,Not As Expected,"Merrill 8.5 EE are not wide. They reflect normal width of most shoes I've worn. The arch support is too far back toward the heel & hurts my feet. Although my wife likes Merrill's,.... I'm certainly not purchasing for myself again. Pretty expensive for not so good fit."
3,Price,"I purchased the shoe thinking it was the old ""Merrel"" line which was made in the states. I have had their boots in the past and loved them. After paying $70 for something that was made in China for $6 I feel ripped off."
5,best shoes ever,"I was in a store where Merrell's are sold and a customer who was wearing an older pair of jungle mocs said that they where the best shoes ever. He then bought another pair of hiking boots by Merrell. His enthusiasim was cause for me to try them, and what a great choice. Everyone should wear these."
5,Merrell Jungle Moc,"It's hard to equal this shoe for comfort and durability, I have purchased several pair over the years, plus they look great with jeans.Happy Camper"
3,Pretty good,"This is my fourth pair of jungle mocs. I do not remember the others requiring some ""break-in time"" so I found them uncomfortable if I wear them very long. It is getting better so I think they will be o.k. soon."
3,SUEDE Jungle Mocs,These are PSUEDE jungle mocs with a colorful little pull tassles at the rears. Very comfortable and not bad for what they are if you want psuede black jungle mocs with little fru-fru pull-on tabs. I am going to get some black laundry marker to the pull thingies.
4,Comfort Shoes,The shoes are comfortable and the price is right. I wear the shoes everyday and because they are slip on they are easy to take off and on when entering the house or other people(s) home.
5,Great Shoes,Merrell Jungle MocsThe shoes were a Christmas present and are great. The shoes are what I expected with the comfort and quality Merrell is know for. The price was great and I would order them again. They were delivered in a timely manner.
4,Positive Experience,"When I first placed my order, it was the wrong shoe. After some communication between me and the seller, they sent a return slip and sent me the correct shoe. Things happen and I ended up with what I wanted."
4,Slip on Moc's,"Very good quality slip-on. The arch is a little high for me. If your going to wear anything but thin socks, I would get a 1/2 size bigger."
2,Too narrow,"These shoes were very narrow and painful on my feet. It is difficult buying shoes on-line and after getting stuck with these, I ended up going to a shoe outlet to find the best fit."
4,Great Comfort,"Purchased these as a replacement of the regular mocs. They are not as slip resistant as the old model, but still are ok, as I wear these in the (pastry) kitchen. I am on my feet all day, and really recommend Merrels for their comfort!"
4,A quality shoe,"Super comfortable and nice looking. I bought a pair of these for $70 last January - now they are closer to $90. Even though the price of these shoes went up over 20% last year, I still will buy them. If the price increases continue into this year, I know there are better deals in other brands."
5,Every two years,"About every two years I have to buy a new pair of these. I wear them almost daily until the soles are smooth, and then I buy another pair. I can wear these with jeans to work every day for a nice casual look, but they're still comfortable and practical. I keep coming back for more..."
5,Husband loves them,These are his third pair. He has artifical hip and knee and these still give him support that he needs.
5,Wonderful,"These are the most comfortable shoes I've ever had. Recommended by a friend, I'm not at all disappointed. Perfectly casual looks."
5,Hubby likes a ton!,This was a gift for my husband and he loves them and wears them often as possible. They look nice too.
4,CSUREVIEW,Generally a very good all around shoe. The fit is right to size and quite comfortable. I would buy these again.
5,Great shoes!!,I buy Merrill shoes for my son every year as part of his Christmas. He is on his feet all day at work. These shoes are very good for that. Cuts out foot and back pain for him. I usually pay over $100 for them in town. So this price was fantastic. Will be ordering another color.
5,Best i have ever had,i have spent my life (63 years) buying shoes that were way to long just to get them wide enough to sort of fit. but no more. try them you will like them.
5,Excellent fit and look!,"The Merrell shoe is exactly what I expected, I bought these shoes for my husband for Christmas and he has not taken them off. He said the fit and feel of the shoe is terrific. He has problems with his back and the support are exactly what he needs for walking. I would recomend these shoes and would buy them again."
4,Very happy so far,"I have been very pleased with several pairs of Merrell shoes and boots in the past, so I thought I would give these a try. A local store did not have my size, but after trying on pairs that were a half-size too large or too small, I decided that my normal size would be a good fit and ordered them on line. I have been wearing the shoes almost continuously in the week since they arrived, and they are very comfortable. Usually, I have difficulty wearing slip-on shoes, because I have a high instep, but these are great. They get four stars rather than five only because I do not know how well they will wear."
5,Merrell Men's Jungle Moc slip-on shoes,"Merrell Men's Jungle Moc shoes have been my number one choice in shoes for comfort and style for the past 10-years. They are especially nice to wear when going through airport security, i.e., slip ons versus shoe laces. I have four pair, a taupe suede daily walking shoe and black, brown and taupe for dress up. Great product at a fair price."
5,"nice color, same great mocs","I got the Fudge color Merrell Jungle Mocs. Very nice deep color, can wear with & pass off as brown or black. Still love the Jungle Mocs after all these years."
5,Very Good Quality and Perfect Fit,I'm always like Merrell Jungle Mocs and ordered this one after my current one finally wore out. Quality leather and comfortable fit.
2,high arch,"sent back high arch, tried in store they were fine. the ones sent to me i couldn't wear due to arch"
5,Always a good buy.,Our son-in-law wears Merrells most of the time. This shoe is always a good gift at least a couple times a year!
5,merrill mocs,Excellent shoe for the person who can't bend over to tie shoes - in my case that would be surgery. They feel great and look great.
