2,not so great,"Says 5 to 10 hours, I'm lucky if it lasts 3 1/2 hours of use.Use it at school because there are no close outlets. With class lasting 4 + hours, I ended up bringing an extension cord.Also, very expensive. Not worth the price."
5,A practical guide to how to be a leader,"I noted that one reviewer really panned this book, but I found it to be very useful. Granted, it's not theoretical or philosophical, but there's lots of those books available. This one is practical. It includes self-quizzes to let you know where you stand on various subjects. It gives you specific steps to take to project leadership qualities. It explains how to be a team leader, how to help groups help themselves (including how to be an empowering leader) and how to help others develop their full potential. This is not the deepest book you'll find on leadership, but it's not supposed to be. Warren Bennis writes books for CEOs (and they're good ones). This book is written for those in the trenches who want to help their people and themselves succeed. I know it's regularly used by trainers who are looking for what to use in their seminars."
4,This is the ONLY one that includes the version you want!,"A club smash and an extremely popular trance tune this is Delerium featuring Sarah Mclachlan's ""Silence"". The one you hear on dance radio and at clubs is actually the ""Airscape Remix"" as the original version is NOT a trance tune and you may be dissapointed by the album if you are looking for trance/dance. A few of the remixes do drag on a bit but it is totally worth the money for this particular remix. A must have item if you're into trance."
2,Messy and hard to get the right temp - get Mooms instead,"I tried this and found it to be very messy. Plus, it's hard to tell if its the right temp since you can't see it - so you can't see the consistency. It is such a mess to remove when it doesn't come off with the strip. Get Moom's instead. It is soooo much easier. ON the positive side - this product was great for sensitive skin."
5,Excelent case,I bought this case for my Canon Powershot A570 and it fits perfectly. It also has space for 2 extra batteries and a memory card. I already dropped it once with the camera inside and it dampened the impact and the camera was fine.Great product!
1,The Anti Rasta,"This hat is SO small....complete disappointment, never even wore it i hate it so much. gives rasta hats a bad name"
1,Car and Travel charger for Sony Ericsson W518a,"Home Travel Charger did not recharge my phone. Waiting for response from Bargaincell (Amazon has responded and is taking care of the issue, but no comment from original seller). The other components from this purchase are still in original packaging--unopened and waiting instructions from Bargaincell. Will not purchase from this seller again."
2,Interferes with Signal,"This product seems fairly well-built, but at least one some cars it seems to interfere with the transponder being read properly. I have a Dodge Stratus and had no luck at all getting my E-ZPass to read when I used this holder. Without the holder, it read perfectly in a variety of different locations around the rear-view mirror. I wonder if having less solid plastic might help resolve this issue.The other design flaw I saw with this unit is that you slide the E-ZPass to the left (when mounted on the windshield) to remove it from the holder. This doesn't work to well if you mounted the holder to the right of the rear-view mirror, the alternate mounting site suggested in the E-ZPass documentation I received. It would have been better if the E-ZPass slid out to the right so it didn't interfere with the mirror."
5,Best EZ-PASS Clip!!,"Best looking EZ-PASS Clip on the market and a must have for anyone that has has an ezpass.The suction cups hold for a very long time, I don't remember a time when the clip fell off.This is the second one I bought as the first one was stolen by my dealership!!! :)Don't get the ugly square white one! get this one!!"
2,There must be better choices,"I really wanted to not stick anything to the windshields in my cars, so this seemed to be a great solution. I have 4 of these in different vehicles, but over time, they all fall off the windshield. It's not dirty glass because I'm a clean car fanatic, or vibration, because they fall off the cars I don't drive often, even when the holders are empty!. Rather, over time, the suction cups just lose their stick. I found the cause for one problem: Distorted mounting lugs for two of the suction cups. EZ-Clip wanted me to send it back, at my expense, and then pay them $2.50 to cover shipping and handling for a warranty issue! Time to try something else..."
2,Worked great...until it melted,"It worked great until a hot summer day melted the plastic. I had the EZClip on my window and also had a sun-shade in the car so I don't know if it just got too hot between the shade and the window, thus melting the plastic, or if it just generally can't withstand direct sunlight in warmer states."
4,Good quality product,"I definitely love this dress. Although I need to work on my belly bulge, it fits really well and serves the purpose I bought it for! ;)"
3,its nice...,"its good for newly married couple...too sexy,but its a bit pricey..what else should be said..the material is soft though 1 enjoys when wearing it."
2,"This is a great dress, but NOT a plus size!","I like the dress itself. I have got a plus size, and was highly disappointed. The open front tries to run back to my butt making a huge very ugly whole in the front. Yes, I have a big butt, but it's not AS big - size 16. And advertised PLUS size will, perhaps, only look good on 8-10 butt size. But PLUS means up to 1-3X! It will perhaps stretch on to a girl of 3x on the top, but the open front will look ugly. I am returning the item, cause for 17 dollars it's too bad-looking on big girls. Do not purchase plus size if you are more than size 12, it will not look good on you. Especially if you are also tall."
1,bad customer service and ill fitting garment,after reading reviews i ordered the xl but even that wasn't large enough to fit my size 10 frame - i then returned it and finally after 5 weeks asked about my refund and it was promptly refunded but they kept a couple dollars for shipping even though i was never initially charged for shipping when i asked about that they told me to file an amazon claim - which i did and was given back the couple dollars they tried to keep for shipping - bad business and even worse customer service
3,Okay quality.,"This item is just okay. The lace isn't the best quality and given the fact that it's a one size fits most, I don't find it fits me like I'd like it to... but you get what you pay for, so I wasn't expecting much. I wouldn't buy it again and I don't think I'd recommend it. I was happy with the seller and it was shipped quickly. I found another much sexier item that I prefer waaaaaay more, so this one never makes it out of the drawer! :)"
2,"Extremely wordy, and unecessarily poetic.","Extremely wordy, and immensely poetic. These are attibutes which would make for a great read were one reading an overely dramatic piece of fiction, but which when incorporated into factual writing merely reduce the credibility of the fact. This is, ofcourse, not to mention the reduction of the readability of the book, and the ability of the reader to follow what ""the heck"" he(Wolf) is trying to say! The first seven chapters are incredibly rough, and by the time one reaches the last chapters, one is left gasping for life."
4,BookLover From NJ,"This book is definitely a must have. I can honestly say my interest was held from beginning to end. At first, I wasn't to quick to buy this book because I don't enjoy short stories. By the time I finished this book, I was eating my words.This book is a collection of 3 stories (2 taking place in present day time and 1 taking place in 18th century England)by 3 great authors. They introduce you to the Colton family of California. The book also is the beginning of a 12 Book series that begins in June 2001. I can't wait until June."
4,Loving it!,"My first Robert Wilson book was A Small Death in Lisbon, which I started reading b/c I was traveling to that area of Portugal. I thought it was outstanding! So, many months later, I'm reading Company of Strangers, and it's fantastic. Wilson's stories are part mystery, part history, incredible description or place and character, engrossing! I love his use of language."
3,Decent Thriller,"Wilson is a competent writer and this book features some of his best attributes. He is good at constructing believable characters and his descriptive writing is good as well. He is, however, attached to excessively busy plots. In this book, he brings in WWII, nuclear espionage, the Cold War, the struggle against the Portugese fascist state of Salazar, and the fall of the Soviet Union. The plot is certainly ingenious but strains credulity, even for popular fiction."
2,Boring spy thriller,"This novel probably wins my prize as the most boring ""thriller"" I've ever read. I waded through the whole thing just to see if it would ever improve. It didn't, but I persevered right through to the disappointing ending. The main problem is that I didn't care about any of the characters. The female lead, a math genius turned spy, just drifts through life letting others manipulate her. The book had great potential but never grabbed me. Robert Wilson may be a fine writer, but he doesn't keep the pages turning for me the way Jack Higgins and the late Robert Ludlum do."
2,Confused,"I love a good spy novel, so I ploughed my way through this even though I sometimes found it not credible. I loved the first part set in 1944 Lisbon with all of its Casablanca-like atmosphere and intrigue. Supposedly the heroine had led a sheltered life; yet she is sent off at age 18 to engage in a most dangerous game, and she actually comes across as quite worldly. I found the whole idea of inter-generational spying not very believable. At the end I found my self paging back through the book to see if I had overlooked a key character in the plot. I don't think I would go out of my way to read another by Robert Wilson."
3,I wish I could have liked this book,"but the story was so plodding, and improbable, and the characters so thin . . .The opening chapters are terrific, showing the inner workings of the Abwehr in WW II-- but the other chapters are anti climactic and do not build on one another--"
2,I wanted to like it,"I'm sorry, I wanted to like this book. It is well written. However, it is written in what I would characterize as a pretentious style. I'm sure many may enjoy this style, but I prefer a more realistic, down to earth narrative. Tolstoy was literate but he wasn't usually pretentious.The main woman character also bothered me; she was just not believable. Maybe there are women who kiss men within hours of meeting them, but I don't know of any. (An expansion of my circle of acquaintances might be in order.) Possibly this was written for a more romantically inclined spy novel audience. I don't know.Rarely do I not finish a book, but this is one that I didn't. I would recommend Alan Furst over this author for a WWII spy novel."
4,"A good read, although not at the level of the masters","An intricately plotted espionage thriller. The descriptions of geographic settings (primarily Lisbon towards the end of the Second World War) are detailed and enjoyable. The plot is carefully crafted and moves well, although Wilson's attempt to ""tie up"" various threads in a neat ending feels quite contrived and flat. The characterers are a bit 2-dimensional, not quite as fully developed and believable as, say, Le Carre.Still, on the whole, a very absorbing read.Also, as another reader has mentioned, Wilson also has a penchant for graphic scenes of sexual violence, so be forewarned if you would find that troubling. They constitute relatively brief portions of the book, but they stand out and feel a bit forced, as if Wilson has decided ""Now it's time to soften up my readers with something really shocking."""
3,Not his best work,"As much as I have liked the 4 other Robert Wilson books I have read, I found ""The Company of Strangers"" very disappointing. The central plot device would be more appropriate for a television soap opera. It is reminiscent more of ""The Thorn Birds"", or ""The Winds of War"" than Wilson's other books. As wild as his plots are in his Seville series, they are tempered by character development and a sense of place that render this series very satisfying. All I felt when I finished ""The Company of Strangers"" was cheated by last half of the book."
2,The Ending DOES Matter!,"An excellent sweep through 50 years of espionage, and the writing is excellent. Unfortunately the ending RUINED my enjoyment of this book. Things seemed as though they were about to end in a somber yet placid way, and then Wilson botched it. There will always be those who don't mind a sad ending, especially if the tale was already grim in nature and subject. There will, I'm sure, always be a percentage of us for whom such an ending will make us less likely to read that author again."
5,nice little collaboration enjoyable...,i was very impressed with the way this album was done each piece standards done with piano by fred bill naturally on guitar done fabulously not a musician myself would like to consider myself one but im not avid listener anyhow the patience selflessness and creativity that each tune exudes is unique blue monk was off the charts to put it simply they got together covered some already covered stuff and seemed to have a blast doing it adding their own styles which brings new character to the songs which never hurts its just the reason why standards or old tunes never die they just keep getting stronger and more evolved dont be hesitant with this one i was briefly glad it was short lived another successful recording available as download on flash or on cloud which is just as guaranteed....
5,A comprehensively researched masterpiece,"Gregory Michno has written what will surely become the reference work on hell ship voyages. Impeccably referenced throughout, with a bibliographic section that will keep me busy for years chasing up articles referred to in his research notes. Gregory draws on recently declassified American and Japanese records of their combined activities and inhumanities committed during desperate times - A master of his topic, with objective analysis revealing that neither side was truly innocent in creating hell on the high seas. At times a harrowing, poignant read. This is a 'must have' book for anyone interested in WWII history."
2,Nice system but will it last,"I bought this item from WalMart Aug 2006 and it is not working well now.I was very happy with it and used it almost every day for 2-3 miles.If it is only going to last 6 months then i need to think if i want to buy from them again. I sent a message on their web site but no response how to tighten belt up.The 90 day warranty 'is' an indication of how long you can expect it to last!Otherwise it has good options and fan, but wish it wouldn't drop the data when the safety ribbon lodges loose. I think I paid about $360 so is a $60 per month workout item. I may upgrade and pay more for a unit with better warranty and a year or more protection.I do not shop at Walmart anymore so will most likely buy online from another manufacturer. I will check their sight Image and make sure I do not buy under another name they sell under."
1,Out of the blue it just stop working,I bought the treadmill a year ago and now it just stop working for no reason.
3,Enjoyed it while it lasted,Purchased this used at a garage sale so i don't really know how old it is. I had it for two years and loved it even though the incline didn't work. Recently the digital display stopped working. Naturally this makes it impossible to see speed/distance/pace. Company says it isn't fixable. Makes me nervous about purchasing a brand new one. What if it happens again?
1,incredible prices...,why only this foolish prices...? And even when the price for a used one is lower you can't buy this because they dont't ship to Europe...
1,Do not buy THIS book,"Derek Walcott is one of the greatest living poets and one of my favorite poets. By all means, read the poetry of Derek Walcott.DO NOT buy this book. The notion that this author's ideas about Walcott's poetry are worth WAY MORE than the *book* its studies are about tells you immediately that whoever stuck this price-tag on *this* book DOES NOT understand art, or poetry, or value."
1,Okay she sings....,"now she needs an arranger. I love Elaine Stritch but these songs for the most part sound the same. Elaine is often her own worst enemy and ends up just showing off (hey, I saw her years ago in Private Lives. That was ego run riot even the director, Charles Nelson Riley, walked out that night). Buy it if you must but there is better, older, wiser Stritch out there."
5,Getting to be a habit with me...,"It's really interesting, listening to this recording, to hear Elaine Stritch's distinctive voice before all those cigarettes and vodka stingers added all the rasp. It's quite easy to see why she was the Merm's understudy for Call Me Madam, though I actually find her *less* abrasive than EM generally is. The songs are hilarious camp (""If"" comes to mind... this is also where you hear the speaking voice and think, ""My God, this really is Stritch!""), and if you are a musical stickler, be sure to listen to the humor to really understand the full value of them... the scatting on ""And the Angels Sing"" seems painful at first, but is great when recognized as just another facet of Elaine's comedic genius. Ms. Stritch sings it all with a wink. On the other end, ""You Took Advantage of Me"" is a great showcase for the vulnerability peeking out from underneath Elaine's hard-as-nails exterior. A must-have piece of Lainey's puzzle!"
2,MMPR ;Two for One Vhs,"Teenage love is in the air.How sickening.At least it's sickening to Lord Zedd.This video is about when Tommy goes on a date with Kimberly and Lord Zedd interrupts it by creating two monsters from Kimberlys purse.This is actually a couple of the rare episodes where Tommy was the white ranger and Jason, Zack, and Trini were still rangers.Well anyway the rangers defeat these monsters and Tommy and Kimberly live happily ever after.Well at least to power rangers zeo where Kimberely breaks up with him,but that comes later.But I wouldnt buy this video unless youre a girl."
4,Classic Lewis,"A good book not only in terms of characterization (Lewis's forte) but also in illuminating select issues of the time (1900s-1930s): women's suffrage, prison reform and the reality of ""vice.""One of Ann/Lewis's strongest achievements is the argument that the nature of prisons essentially exacerbates the crime problem. Ann learns that due to ill-trained wardens/guards and poor conditions ""Prison makes the man who enjoyed beating fellow drunks in a barroom come out wanting to kill a policeman"" (272). However, like in many of Lewis's novels, a solution is presented. Once a prison superintendent herself Ann preaches the virtues of better trained and better paid employees, cleaner and more humane conditions and an extended parole program. While at times Ann's ultimate destiny feels a bit unrealistic, overall, a solid portrait is painted of possibilities of the New Woman of the early twentieth century."
3,Magnets not strong enough,"This will not stay if the vent is painted. I bought these for my kid's rooms' where the vent is in the ceiling and of course, they are painted and the deflectors will not stay. But it does stay nicely on my kitchen vent which is not painted."
3,Magnets not strong enough,"This deflector is ok (if you've lucked into having selected the right model for floor or wall or baseboard etc) but its cheapie magnets hold down only onto unpainted registers. Also the continuous surface of the deflector doesn't allow for the register's middle mounting screw head sticking up from the surface. Its presence thus deflects the deflector's bottom surface up from the register's mid-surface, preventing the deflector from setting firmly down flat. To Anyone having painted registers: Solve the bad-magnets problem by replacing them with strips of double-sided adhesive tape or the similar Velcro tape. Both provide excellent hold-down power. Once again a modern product carelessly does not properly do the job buyers have a right to expect of it."
5,Stairway to the Stars,"This classic album opens with a wonderfully moody ballad, aptly titled, for this disc is a stairway leading into the musical genius of some of the brightest stars in jazz history, John Coltrane and Milt Jackson. There is not a bad track on this album, and the supporting cast, including Paul Chambers and Connie Kay, could not be better. Perhaps my favorite tune is ""The Late Late Blues"" which has a very catchy bass line/melody. This recording dates from 1960, a transitional period for Trane, after his fruitful period in the Miles Davis quintet, but before the final years leading his own group. He has that soul-searching, searing sound. Overall, one of the most satisfying jazz discs you'll ever hear!"
1,Product is Mislabeled,"I bought this CD based on customer reviews and after auditioning the free audio samples on Amazon. When I received the product, the CD inside was different from what was described on the website. The actual CD was entitled ""Los Piratas"". I returned the product thinking that it was just a mistake on Amazon's part. When I received the replacement shipment, I got the same wrong CD. I filed for a refund request which Amazon promptly processed. I have purchased numerous items from Amazon over many many years and this is the first time this has ever happened. I recommend that Amazon management adopt and implement stricter quality control procedures for its merchandise."
1,Tao Te Ching Junk,"This crappy little book is overpriced and over rated. To make matters worse, the copy that I bought was used. Gigantic ripoff!!!!!"
5,Delivered on expectations,"If you are a Dave Brubeck fan as I am, you'll love this collection of Ballads. I have always been a fan of his mainly because of his uptempo alternative take on rhythm so I was pleasently surprised by these wonderful ballads."
4,great introduction to typography,"This book is a great introduction to typography. I learned a lot and the book gives you lots of examples of nice typefaces to try out. The chapters about email, fax, and websites are severely outdated."
2,Over rated book sets a poor example,"This book, while attractive and expensively produced, is actually _not_ a good example of _how_ to use type.From the cover, which uses small, light italcs reversed (which are hard to read) to the body text which is set with too much letterspacing (just what the title of the book warns against) so that it's hard to read.There are many fine books about typography, for a complete list, visit http://www.delvemediarts.com/book-ndx.htm and find one that will be more useful than this over-rated, badly produced tome.Zeal"
4,Helping to break the type mind-block...,"I'm a designer who has always had one huge weakness. I have a really hard time conveying the right feeling with, balancing or even playing with type in my designs. This book was suggested to me by a person I have a great deal of respect for, so I read it.It has made all the difference in the world! It explains the different faces, how type can enhance or destroy your piece, and how to not mess up the choices too badly.I would recommend this book to anyone who is trying to understand how type affects the way people see you publication or ad or people who are trying to get a handle on using type as a design element."
1,Disappointing,"Erik Spiekermann is better than this. This is more on the level of basic advice, such as that found in Robin William's work, only not as good.Someone truly interested in typography would do better, much better, with Bringhurst's Elements of Typographic Style."
5,Gideons Bible has a new insert,"This book has been in the minds of talented designers everywhere. Typographers have unfortunately always held the view that if you had to ask, you would never know. Well, I didn't, so it was a long, tedious journey. Now I know, forget the trip to type Mecca and save yourself the art directors humiliation, just get this book. All of a sudden Futura Condensed Extra Bold will make sense. Easy"
4,Interesting book about type,"This book is required reading by my professor. It's one of the easiest books to read and understand. Because it is designed by a graphic artist and type developer, I would assume that this book would communicate ideas and information easily (which it does).Created for a European audience, the book has smaller sized text and a column of red footnotes on most, if not all pages. This could distract, annoy or put off many who are not used to smaller sized fonts in a book.Overall, I enjoy looking through this well designed, informative book and would definitely keep it for reference in the future."
3,Good for an overview,"It was a good, entertaining read, if a bit light on actual content. Useful if you have no idea what type to pick, but if you've ever thrown something together by the seat of your pants and had someone comment favorably on it, you probably don't need this. Some people are born with an innate design sense -- this is for those who weren't."
4,Quick Read for Newbies,"Today, web information is mostly text. Case in point, you are reading this. Trouble is text on most sites is not appealing. To increase the text appeal of my sites I turned to this book.The book is a good introduction to typography and a very fast read, under 3 hours. Good for beginners; however, it left me wanting more. It was more like a 10pm news trailer -- woman found walking city streets with nothing on but a hockey mask. I was expecting a book to explain what specific font conveys. Instead the book provides example situations and suggested fonts.I give it four-stars, and try to find the next book on the subject."
2,Overly basic and poorly organized,"I am a relative newbie to the study of typography, but still this book is far too basic. I learned a single fact which I had always been curious about - that the letterforms of smaller-point type are different from (not just smaller than) larger-point type in the same face - and that is a pretty elemental thing that most people interested in type are already aware of.More suprisingly, there are some serious issues with the layout and typography of this book. Some sidebars, which are in small type, are set in yellow. Small yellow print on white paper? Surely a legibility no-no. Also, each page serves as its own mini-essay (and I do mean MINI; on most spreads, only the right-hand page has any text, and even then sometimes only half a page) but lacks a headline, so the reader has no idea what the page is about.The only useful element in this book is the various type examples, which could easily be found elsewhere."
4,Nice quality planter,"I bought this planter as a gift for my mother. It is a very nice quality product. The metal is heavy and appears to be well made. The planter attaches to a deck railing without damaging the wood as it does not use nails or screws. My only complaint is the shipping was expensive, but the planter and shipping together were still less expensive than other planters I have seen. Overall, I am very pleased."
1,avoid,"I saw Annie Ross perform in London, sitting at the table next to Cleo Laine & family incidentally, and cringed when she did some of the songs that appear on this album. The problem here, where she proves she can still have success with the Short Cuts soundtrack, is not the decline in the quality of her voice but the choice of a lot of kitsch songs - ie the horrific title track - full of 'I knew all those famous jazz people way back then' stuff or tired versions of her cool songs from 40 yrs ago. I left my copy at home when I changed countries. She is still a great artist but the 50's records or the Short Cuts soundtrack are the ones to go for."
2,"ANNIE ROSS, MUSIC IS FOREVER","WELL I LOVE ANNIE, BUT HER VOICE IS PASS HER PRIME TIME, THE ARREGEMENT BY MIKE RENZY(THE BEST ON THE BUSINESS) IS GREAT BUT HER VOICE LEAVE A LOT TO DESIRE, THIS IS NOT BILLIE'S LADY IN SATIN BY ANY MEANST, nelson"
3,"Good, but not great","There is so much information in this book. A great book to have for use. However, as an A+ study guide, I find that the A+ objectives do not match the page numbers a lot of the time. It is time consuming and confusing trying to find all the objectives. I think that there are other books better written out there, and I intend to find them."
2,"""Enhanced"" A+ Guide... Ha","The class I'm taking uses this book, and well I'm less than impressed with it so far. The book does a very poor job of providing thorough definitions for a variety of technical terminology (i.e. page fault or virtual machine). Instead the author likes to use analogies to help put it in perspective I guess for the ""non-technical"" individual, but it really doesn't help. I mean if someone is using this book it's most likely going to be because they already have some kind of technical backround... you would have to in order to understand it. I personally appreciate more comprehensive definitions as opposed to cute analogies (i.e. like driving a vehicle and whatnot). On the flip side of that, while they try to appeal to the beginner ""techie"", they also uses some acronyms that they do not even include in their glossary much less explain them at the time they mention them in the book. They don't seem to be consistent in the way they define things."
2,"Oh yeah, I forgot to mention....","The author refers to tables and diagrams that are consistently several pages back so they got you flipping back and forth through the book. The tables/diagrams are nice, but if you really want someone to comprehend what you're explaining while giving them a visual... put them on the same page!!!!!"
1,[poorly written],"...we used this for a textbook spring semester.the book is very poorly written, and needs an edit badly. chapter 2 makes 3 attempts to explain the boot-up process. one attempt would be adequate if english were used.the analogy to an auto is cute, but worthless. it explains nothing.andrews uses the words ""recall"" and ""remember"" over and over and over.the book attempts to cover too many subjects. for example, leave networking to networking books. explain how a computer works, and that'd be more than enough, if clearly written.also, the book should be restricted to the current windows edition, for example, windows xp. and windows 3x, and 9x should be put into an appendix. it's just too confusing to newbies to attempt to explain the history of operating systems while the real task at hand is explaining how a computer works and computer repair."
3,used book,"After I looked on line to possilby purchase a new book, it would have been cheaper for me to buy the book new than thru Amazon."
5,"An impressive ""must have"" for your bookshelf!","This book has information regarding the elements that I have not seen anywhere else. Insightful, and creative, the content of this book appeals to both to the beginning and intermediate student of the occult. I went on the suggested journeys and found them well thought out, highly interesting, and came back with information about each direction that I had not been aware of in my 20 years as a Priestess. No serious student or teacher of the occult arts should be without this book."
4,An Integrated and Balanced Therapeutic Approach,"Dr. Mullen's addition to the present array of books in the field of healing for the whole person is considerable. His background and experience in the field allows him to speak and write with authority. The specific appreciation that I have for Dr. Mullen's offering is the integration and balance that he brings to the work of healing. He genuinely believes and perceives value in a wide range of approaches because the diverse faculties of body, soul and spirit require it. He therefore contributes from his wealth of insights to the present literature with integrity and grace. His gift to his readers is that he takes nothing away from other approaches and invites us to practice with synergy."
3,Entertaining although the time travel gets tricky,"I read this book in high school and was surprised to see I'm the first reviewer here.I first read Laumer in an anthology called Chrestomathy. Then I picked up Dinosaur Beach. It was a fun diversion for a teenager fascinated with science fiction. The hero is fun to follow, and if you can suspend disbelief long enough to last through Laumer's time travel antics, you will enjoy this one."
4,Teaching math using groaner style jokes,"Mirror symmetry is something that can be used in the creation of many games. In this story, written for the early adolescent, the principles of mirror symmetry are used to solve a century-long mystery of lost treasure. However, the feature of the book that is most enjoyable is the dialog and the comic references. There is Rommel, the desert rat, Saddlesore Capone, and Mr. Mutard in the library.The plot is that of a spoof of a bad western, which provides plenty of opportunities for jokes, some of which are obvious, but where many are very subtle and take a bit of thought before you get them. This is a good book for children, in that it teaches them mathematics while presenting a story that keeps their interest. It is a worthy addition to all middle school libraries."
3,Too much money,You can find all of these cars at Stop and Shop for 3.99. Including Lizzie and Sarge and all the extra cars in the movies. You can also find the at flea markets for the same price. I just wish they had made a Tex.
2,Good toy but watch the price!!,"These are great little toys, and my three year old is obsessed with them! He's getting most of them for Christmas, but we've already bought him a few. They're die cast, so they are a good weight, but note that some of them have plastic pieces as well.Even though I like these toys, I'm only giving them two stars. This is a horrible price!! I honestly bought Sally today at my local K-Mart, and it was on sale for $2.89 (normally $3.19). Now I know when items are scarce and in high demand their price goes up, but this is a crazy markup. I understand that this is a third party seller, but Amazon should note with their sellers that there is a difference between mark up for high demand toys and rip offs. I have purchased Chick Hicks ($9.50) and Lizzie ($5.00) off of eBay, but I've been able to find the rest of the cars at my local Targets, Wal-Marts, K-Marts, etc. It takes time and searching, but it beats paying these prices!"
2,not enough,Book was misleadingI was mislead into thinking there were more then 1 recipe for bath bombs. There was only 1
4,"Great, BUT",If you haven't got the first Gay Mexico by this author it is well worth the money. If you do have the first one save your money.
1,No difference,Didn't seem to do anything. I felt no different and experienced no change in sensitivity or desire. I can't really recommend it as a valid product
5,Fascinating and Useful,"This book is fascinating and remarkably useful. it`s great both for browsing and for reference. I`ve already bought and read two books I found described here and have added several more to my ""to read"" list. Hooked on Horror is worth the price for anyone who likes horror stories--not only is it enjoyable in itself, but it leads you to other reading within your areas of interest that you may never have known abou otherwise. I know that's true for me."
1,"No Mac compatibility, very buggy","Too complicated - should be easy to record and play MP3's but it's very confusing. Also gives me many ""Format Errors"" on the MP3's I uploaded. I'm using a Mac which their software doesn't use, so that might be part of the issue, but I'm surprised there is no mac compatibility. I""m just dragging and dropping MP3's onto the hard drive of the MP3 player."
1,No Hello Kitty,"My daughter got this for Christmas this year. It isn't compatible with any ""to-go"" music service, it is basically a very cheap MP3 player. My daughter generally takes care of her toys and this is already torn up. It is confusing to figure out how to get it to play as well. Now my daughter listens to my old MP3 player and this one has been 'retired'."
2,2GOOD2BTRUE:,"Well, the samples are cool enough: disco, house, acid, jazz, etc. Here is the downside: You can't save anything (unless you have additional software), maximum playback is around a minute, and the program shuts down automatically at 15 minutes, and you have to start from scratch. What's up with that G?"
1,This is just my opinion only,"This cd seemed to run out of brilliant ideas. There seemed to be no clear cut direction that this cd would take. No one seemed to take charge about where this cd would go.The idea for a ""Romantic"" cd was great one, but the powers that be, didn't do a very good job of developing this theme.I thought the band used too much electronic instrumentation. I also felt like the repertoire was a little unexciting.As everyone will agree, music is an outward reflection of ones' personality. Each personality requires different kinds of music. For me, my personality requres the old standards, comptempory music will not work with me. I'm old fashioned!Recommendation: I can not recommend this cd."
4,a beautiful catalogue,"This book was produced for an exhibition at the metropolitan musuem of art in 1994. It shows how visions of 'the exotic' in places like asia and the middle east have affected western dress over the centuries - right up to the present time.This volume is illustrated with numerous lovley colour photos of the exhibition pieces, which range from the 18th to 20th centuries. The text is quite light and easy to read, and the book does not have an index.I give this book 4 stars for the photo and presentation content, but I'd have to drop one off for the text content. It's not a big book at 95 pages, but it's a nice one:)"
1,Only lowercase? What's the point?,In my opinion this book is not a good practice book unless your child already knows how to write lowercase letters. It only has each letter one time and from there the child has to write the letter on their own. I had initially gotten it for my 5 yr old but he needs more help than this book gives.
2,Only good if you like your hair,"I have tried this product numerous times on straightened hair. I spend from 15 to 30 minutes straightening my hair. I took a small dollop of this product, applied it, and almost instantly, my hair curled and 30 minutes of hard work was completely ruined! I suppose it works well with your natural hair type, so if you like your hair type there won't be any problems; however, if you put hard work into curling or straightening your hair, this product is likely to ruin everything you work for, so I do NOT recommend it."
4,"good seller, good book","Book condition was in good condition, book was also a pretty interesting read and worth buying if you are interested in applying physics to biomolecules."
5,good book - for a science major,the book gives a physical basis of science and how to understand it using layman examples and experiments.
5,Ministry,"When I first heard ""I Need You Now"", I broke down in tears. I could hear the sincerity in his voice and his voice alone had be on cloud nine. So soft, but yet so powerful. Smokie has only seen the wilderness of the promise that GOD has yet to reveal..... SMOKIE you are indeed a blessing.."
4,Great but...,"I heard him live and this CD does NO justice to how he sings live. The CD limits him significantly, but for those who haven't heard him live, then its a nice little cd."
4,I Need You Now(wonderful),"I am impressed by this album and the artist. This is a wonderful collection of songs ranging from traditional to urban contemporary. Smokie is an extremely talented brother. He writes, sings, and produces. That's always a nice combination. ""I Need You Now"" is by far my favorite. The rests of the songs are great also. This album appeals to the traditional listener as well as the contemporary listener. If you need something to groove to in your truck, it's on the CD. If you need worship, it's on there. If you need good ol-fashioned chuch, it's on there too. This album is definitely a nice addition to my collection. Be Blessed"
4,Inspite of everything,"I really loved this one particular song called ""still say,thank you"" Oh God he outs you right in front to think about everything that is going on in your life and you have no choice but to say thank you because things could be worse that what we really make of them. I know that song is for me that song has ministered to me. also i am a member of the acts' of praise dancers and we minister off of that song and it just makes you say thank you even when you cant' you're spirit man says thank you. I want to say thank you to God and secondly to smokie thank you and i love you for making me realize that we have to say thank for the good times and the bad times because we are all in God's plan."
4,Excellent,"Very enjoyable CD! Smokie really does a great job with this one. I had to listen to it a few times to get with it, but once I got ""it's all about you"" in my head it stuck there good. Of course ""I need you now"" is great, and I really like the trad gospel track ""Praise Him"" He has a sweet voice and his piano playin aint bad either."
5,A PURE Gift of Song!!,"I have heard Smokie perfom live. He is an awesome talent and man of God. His voice is pure and wonderful. I think my favorite song by him has the same name as his CD ""I need you now"" which is what I saw him sing live on BET. It was a very compassionate and deep performance. I'm not sure where he came from, but his voice is along the lines of Deitrick Haddon and any member of Commisioned and Take 6. This CD has slow and R&B type Jesus songs. As a secular artist he would easily be a chart topper, but I'm glad he has chosen to sing for the Lord. It's obvious he's a natural. The Lord has truly blessed him with the gift of song."
5,BLESSING,"I'm going to keep this short, I have not heard the album yet, but this young brother is truly blessed. When I heard him sing on BET, I said to myself I have to get his album. I'm telling everybody you don't have to here a sample, just go buy it. Smokie Norful is the TRUTH"
2,Misfires,"Pasted-together remainders from several live concerts over many years, audibly not well enough played to be on A-or-B-level albums. Better versions by Last appear elsewhere except for odd attempts at R&B. Life is too short to keep this one with more than 100 other Last discs available. His works range from exquisite to reprehensible, this is not the worst but far from the best."
5,EXCELLENT !,"Although the delivery of the information is poor, this tape is full of very informative facts about herbs in general and about specific herbs. The intro has a great explanation of the concepts behind herbology which is enlightening and provided me with a different and valuable perspective. The author shows how to harvest each herb, and its specific uses. She also covers how to use the herb (tea, tincture, etc...). Even though I have been studying herbs for several years I still learned a lot of new information from this tape but it starts with the basics so a beginner would learn a lot as well. Well worth it !"
4,MotoCross action,I've always enjoyed motocross so this game is a perfect fit for fun and action and learning the difficulty levels is good to.
4,My Review,Great game. Only negative is that I have random crashes. Trying to work with the developer to solve these problems.
2,Better for review than first-time study.,"Erik Friis' book, ""Mastering Norwegian"" is better for use as a review or second-year course than for first-time experience with the Norwegian language."
3,I've been waiting for something better :(,"I've been a fan of Britney since her first album and got all the singles she released. Her last single, Lucky didn't climb up the charts as waited. Stronger is a great song, and after watching that amazing video Britney made for It I couldn't wait for the CD. When I bought the single I heard the songs.1. Stronger Album version The best song of the CD2. Walk on By A very nice song like sometimes unreleased before3. Instrumental Version No comment4. Miguel Migs Club Edit A little slow but ok.Britney produced a single with an unreleased track to fill space. The remix it's not very good and Walk On By is miles better. If I was at Britney's position I'd probably released a CD with more and better remixes. If you are a Britney fan like me I suggest you to search and buy ""Stronger The Remixes"", a very cool CD with 8 different remixes of Stronger or the ""Europe Maxi"" single witch is as good as the remixes."
5,a very beautiful book that catch your heart completely,"This book is not only have amazingly beautiful photographs of the Indonesian fauna, flora and native people, it also give you a very deep and insight story of each of them which bring you to realize how beautiful all the creatures on earth are. After reading this book, I have this giant urge in my body to buy a good camera and to go to these beautiful nature reserves in Indonesia to meet and to see and to take pictures of these animals , flowers, trees, people and listen to each story these people have for their unique creatures"
2,Another Elvis Wannabe,"This is a book about two people who used each other. Priscilla used Michael for his modeling connections and Michael used Priscilla just to be part of Elvis's world. I felt Michael was more in ""love"" with Elvis than he ever was with Priscilla. What he wrote about Lisa Marie I thought was really sad. She was a neglected and sad little rich girl. When Michael wrote about himself his actions were embarassing and egotistical. He was always comparing himself to Elvis. Priscilla sounded more into herself than with him or Lisa. It certainly did not help his career after his involvement with Priscilla Presley. The pictures in the book were wonderful! I think the book would of been better if Michael had help creating the stories in a format with better wording and deleted stories that had no basis to his life with Priscilla and Lisa."
1,rubbish,Not even worth a look I wish now I hadn't. He sometimes assumes things that Elvis did or said as if he knew him. Mr. Edwards didn't come into Priscilla's life until a year after Elvis died.This guy is a major creep and throughout the book it's as if he really thinks he's something. To say that Elvis and Priscilla decided to have Lisa Marie because their marriage was failing was pretty ignorant to say since Lisa was conceived during their first month of marriage and was born exactly 9 months after their wedding.I can't believe this guy admitted to having sexual and romantic feelings for a girl who is the same age as his own daughter (and in her early teens).I felt totally creeped out by this guy.
3,More insight into Priscilla Presley,"The only reason I read this book, was to understand the person who is Priscilla Presley a little more. Although, the book was obviously written for the money, it did give some interesting information. Priscilla is and always has been out for herself, and whatever she can get with the Presley name. I always suspected that, and I believe it even more now."
1,Bullshit,"Hi, I think this book is a piece of crap. The guy who wrote this book is a big looser. He has not comparision with Elvis at all. He wants to be better than Elvis trying to describe Elvis like stupid, fat and dump. He showed Priscilla like she was too much for Elvis. Also, this guy was kind the sick describing how he wanted to have sex with mother and daughter. I feel bad for Priscilla that had to live with this guy for 7 years. I actually this book make me feel soory for her. In conclusion, I don't believe what he said."
4,Welsh Poetry,"You have to be a nut to want this book. Welsh poetry is a strange, lyrical beast that cannot really be translated into English. We only get a flavor or the cadence, complexity and the sound of the language. I don't speak Welsh but I was around a lot of Welsh coal miners as a kid and I can remember them reciting poems, slightly in the beer, you know. That's why I bought it."
4,Useful,"This is a useful book, but not the very best handbook of differential diagnosis. For my money, that accolade goes to Differential Diagnosis pocket, by Sailer and Wasner.Differential Diagnosis Pocket: Clinical Reference Guide (Pocket (Borm Bruckmeier Publishing))."
4,Vintage Guitar magazine review:,"Ninety years of age seems a fine time to bring out a CD. Cuba's elder statesman of music, Compay Segundo, first found a wide listening audience in the USA with Ry Cooder's formidable Buena Vista Social Club album. But Segundo has been playing in his native land for almost seventy-five years now. Still, it's never to late to catch onto a good thing. This new, solo album features Segundo's haunting vocals front and center, accompanied by his armonico guitar, a seven-string creation with only six tones, the third string repeating a tone. He is joined by a variety of musicians, incuding Raimundo Amador and his flamenco guitar, and many others. The sound of Segundo's sons and other songs is a lilting, bouncing feel, propelled by the soft percussion of bongos and maracas. The music is sweetly evocative, perfect for dancing or staring into the bottom of a glass of beer."
4,It was good but it was just a little introductury to a book.,I thought it should have some more information on the books.
5,LOVE 'EM,"Great cookware. Nothing sticks, super easy clean up! I like this set better than my caphalon set I had pre Katrina!"
1,"Amazon vehicle application said it was correct, but wrong part?","Amazon on line vehicle application said this was the correct fan for my 1999 Chev astro. The electric connection had only one terminal, the astro has two terminals on the connector. The fan was smaller then the one removed from the astro. What a pain after removing unit to find it wouldn't work...I did receive a full refund from Amazon..."
4,Good book,I real victorian classic. The only issue I have with it is that its the same thing over and over again in each chapter. Worth a read however.
4,Great Sampler,"I enjoyed the book that was printed in it's entirety. The Tragedy is an experience drawn out to be savored. I liked the characters very much and was curious to see how they worked/played together in the Comedy. The Comedy did become a bit repetitive, but the last chapter woke me up again. The stories were interesting - but they are definitely included to entice the reader into purchasing more books. I have purchased 2 books based on these stories. I felt most of the stories were too short. There is a 2-parter that I liked, but I haven't been able to find the full volume because the original title is not included."
3,Man with a Maid is ok,"the story is ok, especially the first 20 pages, after that it is to predictable."
3,Sun Pass Toll Klip Holder,"This Klip holds my sun pass quite well. One of the suction cups will not stay attached to the window so if I put it up by the rear view mirrow if falls off. However, if I place it low on the windshield by the dash board the suction cup holds it still and then I don't worry about it falling off of the window."
2,Not so great.....,"This product is good, but has some issues with staying stuck to the windshield. If I had to purchase again, I would get one that had 3 suction cups and not only 2. It keeps falling off and hitting the floor. So I just keep it in the glove box. Just FYI. Get one with 3 or 4 suction cups."
2,Better Than Nothing,With only two suction cups it rattles - needs a third point of attachment. I slid a piece of ethafoam behind it...
2,Disappointed,"This film tells the story of a great battle where a group of village of Thai villages held off a major army from Burma history. The story itself, I found well explained. I found the story line appeared to be weak. The acting I thought was poor. The action was okay.If you are going to do a movie like this, I think you need to spend more money then what people did on this movie."
1,Does not work on se47,"this charger will not work on a kyocera se46 slider, bought one and had to return it"
3,Not really satisfying,"One of the main points of programming books is to help the reader understand the models being programmed. On this count, ""Advanced modelling in finance using Excel and VBA"" fails miserably. There is very little explanation of the financial concepts and models. Anyone hoping to learn finance from this book will be very disappointed.The result is a series of programming black boxes and ugly spreadsheets having only limited usefulness.Although the level of his book is somewhat lower, Benninga's ""Financial Modeling"" book is much better at explaining the conceptual basis of financial models. A good programmer will be better off with Benninga than with Jackson-Staunton."
3,Interesting,"I would recommend this book for anyone interested in risk management. I give only three stars to this book because it is not comprehensive, it continuously refers to other books and is not very scientific ( It just uses certain modells without giving the background theory and proof).The book does not touch the aspect of valuation models.Abyone reading this book needs a strong statistical knowledge. VBA used is very very simple, so if you do not have a good programming basis this might be the book for you."
4,A wonderful soundtrack for any R and H fan!,"Well it was about time someone took the great movie and made it into a play. And they did. This great soundtrack includes songs from the origional movie, the re-make, and some of Roger's and Hammerstein's not-so-sucessful plays. Unfortunately Andrea McCardle makes her character sound too childish with her very young and squeaky voice. This is a great album to own, though. It's as if all of the songs were written directly for this show...A must have."
1,What a disaster,"This was a complete rip-off. Song downloads but won't run without license. When I tried to get a license, I was sent into a circle jerk and never got it.Save your money."
2,Yet to grab me,"I bought this CD three weeks ago.I have played it several times, but nothing has yet leapt out and grabbed me about it.I like much of Rodgers & Hammerstein's work, and some of the music here was written when they were at their most influential, directly after Carousel. Somehow though, this show just doesn't ring true. Some of the songs here are having their public debut - maybe R&H had a point in storing them away.I cannot pinpoint why, but this recording just leaves me pretty much cold."
5,Wonderful product,"We gave our nine yr. old grandson this train for Christmas. He had a such a good time putting it together, then running it on the track. The train absolutely glides on the track, so quietly and smoothly. It is a great product."
4,Smooth ride!,"This is the best Lego train assembly ever. The tracks snap smoothly so is the train moving above. You need lots of AA batteries: Nine! but they seem to last. If you are into the train thing, make sure you buy additional tracks and switches to make more fun than just an oval."
5,Wonderful music,"This is a fantastic CD. The music is fresh, relaxing and wonderful. It's a must have for a lazy Sunday afternoon or anytime you just want to relax."
5,SO relaxing and peaceful,"I am not a musician, so I can't comment on the techncial aspects of this album. I love this album becuase it is so peaceful and relaxing. I think the second song, Shadow Dancer, is the most beautiful melody I have ever heard. I don't know why they don't play it on the New Age radio stations. Shadow dancer makes me think of a feather floating through a still forest. At the end of a stressful day, I put this CD on so that it can loosen all the knots in my head. I need more albums by this guy."
1,I don't get it,"Very bad, cheap production or maybe I had great expectation about this movie especially with Hani El Roumani in it.. I wasn't able to finish it."
5,Incredibly relaxing and beautiful...,"My parents played this CD throughout the house every night growing up. It was our signal for ""time to go to bed."" It instantly puts you at ease and you'll sigh a sigh of relief as you relax and drift off to sleep. If you don't have this, get it. You won't regret it."
5,Unmissable,"Just when you thought TV doesnt get any better than The Sopranoes and The Wire along comes Breaking Bad.To say this is a masterpiece is an under statement. It smacks of Zola with humor(A very black humor)This has everything,the story,the acting the script,one runs out of superlatives.Congratulations to everyone involved I cant wait for 4.Slainte."
5,Addicting!!!,You'll love this show. It's unexpected and full of twists and turns. I can't wait to get to the next show.
5,Get Bad and stay bad,"If you are new to BB or just want your own set, all four box sets (soon to be five) are excellent, well crafted, and contain many features to please the viewer. It's a bit pricey, but that BB for you."
2,Check the cable!,"You may have a false sense of security with this antistatic pad. In my case there was a loose connection somewhere in the cable. I connected a meter and discovered a break in the line.If you have this product, be sure to check the cable."
4,good product but one problem,"This mat is exactly as advertized. be advised that it is rolled up in the package and will not lay flat unless heavy weight is placed on it overnight. still tends to curl a little after that. when done, don't roll back up or you will have same problem again....."
3,Not the best mat I've used,"The mat itself is very large, but slides around too much for my liking to the point that unless i really need it i dont. The clasp on the grounding cable on my mat is also lose that it unsnaps at times. The price wasn't the greatest and the faster shipping didn't help at all. I just wasn't satisfied with this purchase."
3,TIE PIN,"Initially, the recipient of this gift thought it was too big...would have preferred a 2ct but he is wearing. Personally, i think it looks nice."
5,Best CD I've ever listened to,"""Dig through the ditches and burn through the witches and slam on the back of my Dragula""Rob Zombie's ""Hellbilly Deluxe"" is a kick ass CD. It has really freaky music while still having that addicting feature that makes you want to listen to it again. I have 2 different copies of ""Dragula"". This way, I can hear the song just about whenever I want to. I think that this a great CD for heavy metal/hardcore music lovers everywhere"
5,This music rules.,This is some of the greatest head-banging music you'll ever hear. It has the greatest songs like Dracula. This CD gives a new meaning to hard rock.
5,rob at the peak,"Zombie,with this has put out the best cd of his career.don't know if he'll put one out this good again.Living Dead Girl and Dragula are the most familiar tracks on here, but there are plenty of songs of the same high caliber."
3,Rob Zombie - Hellbilly Deluxe,"I thought Rob's first solo outing without White Zombie was his weakest, but still not a bad attempt. Maybe I'm just burnt out on ""Dragula"" and ""Living Dead Girl"", but they just do not seem to have the same intensity that White Zombie held. It may not be fair to compare the two, but hell, they have similar names, came from the same person, and both sound alike, Rob Zombie just being a watered down version. There are some excellent tracks on here, ""Superbeast"" and ""Return of the Phantom Stranger"" being two of them, but I just did not enjoy this as much as I should have. An average CD for me, a commercial success for Rob Zombie, the good thing is that he only got better from here. So far..."
4,Rob Zombie proves that he can make it on his own,"Rob's first solo album after leaving White Zombie proves to be a success. The best songs would have to be the 3 leading singles, ""Living Dead Girl"", ""Dragula"", and ""Superbeast"". The album is kind of short, coming up at only 38 minutes, but it's awesome nonetheless. The dark, sort of creepy theme of this CD is really cool. If you're looking for some good ""horror rock"", check this album out."
3,...BOO! ...,"...White Zombie's industrial sludge metal kingpin releases his first solo album to very little avail...The album starts strong with Superbeast, Dragula, and Living Dead Girl. Hard, Pumping, Typical Industial.However, the rest of the songs are far from special and remind me of a cheap Halloween special. Kinda like freak show music while lacking a little freak and scare....Not recommended..."
4,Explosive peice of eerie metal,"Rob Zombie's first solo album after his former band, White Zombie, is an irresistably eerie hardcore metal masterpeice, with incredibly hardcore songs like ""Suberbeast"" and one of my favorites, ""Dragula,"" (...dig through the ditches and burn through the witches and slam in the back of my...)Other songs on here include ""Living Dead Girl"" and ""The Ballad of Ressurection Joe and Rosa Whore."""
3,Zombie is Saved by Dragula,"Alright it was good but way too short. Plus a lot of the songs on this cd were just plain dumb, Songs like: Perversion 99, How to make a monster, What lurks on Channel X, all could have been done away with. Even then the cd doesn't have the Zombie quality. All these people claiming this cd is the best probably didn't follow Rob's career when he was with White Zombie. Though I must admit that Superbeast, Dragula, and Meet the Creeper were good. But White Zombie was much better and Much heavier. Yeah Blasko and Riggs can play, but J. and Sean Yseult were the best. Rob made a big mistake with letting them go. He could have gone solo and kept the former band members. If you want to hear Rob at his best Get White Zombie's Astro-Creep 2000, It's much heavier and better listening."
1,Don't Buy Weak Edited CD's!,"I dig Rob. The man's music is awesome. But the edited version of this CD sucks and is not marked as an edit in the packaging. The blurred spots on Resurrection Joe make the track unlistenable. If I was scared about hearing bad words I would have bought a Celine Dion disc. I want to hear Rob, not Tipper Gore's approved manipulation of his work."
4,Rob Zombie - 'Hellbilly Deluxe' (Geffen) 4 1/2 stars,"Review #335. Rob Zombie's first solo work after he took a short leave from White Zombie. I remember telling fans that he'll go solo ONLY if this debut of his sells good enough for him to spark up a solo career. Looks like I was right, as Rob never went back to White Zombie since. Tracks here that will remain as true 'extreme metal' gems to us loyal long-timers include ""Call Of The Zombie"", the *ss-stomper ""Dragula"" (still like catching the video for this song), ""How To Make A Monster"", the awesome mosh-pit staple ""Living Dead Girl"" and ""Spookshow Baby"". Simply a must-have, if there's still anyone out there that doesn't possess a copy."
2,Uninteresting.,"You know, there's not many things I dislike about this album, so it's very hard to pan it. But there's also nothing I really love about it either, and therein lies the problem: The best music provokes the most extreme reactions. Zombie's earlier work with White Zombie certainly did. In being banned from performing in myriad Bible-belt states (can't remember which ones exactly), White Zombie were a lightning rod for outrage, with their Satanic imagery and lyrics.However, Rob Zombie's solo work doesn't do anything for me. It's not at all challenging musically, and the lyrics are very bland. It's not that Rob made a bad album; he made a safe album, and THAT's the problem with Hellbilly Deluxe."
2,For the kiddies....?,"I'm sorry, but this new Rob Zombie is nothing next him with White Zombie. White Zombie was sheer madness and an excellent metal band, but now that Rob has went solo his music seems more like something you'd hear on a Goosebumps episode on Fox Saturday Morning For Kids or some crap. White Zombie was nothing like that. White Zombie was some dark stuff, but Rob is amusing for the first four songs and then you realize that it is just stupid, unoriginal, and very annoying. I think Rob Zombie's main fan base is centered more around 7th graders than real metal fans......"
2,Disappointing,"This is one of those CDs you only buy for a few songs. The only good songs on here are Super Beast, Dragula, and Living Dead Girl. However, he just could not keep up with the great heavy sound that he produced in the first three songs. The rest of the album is boring and repetitive to the point of just plain BAD."
2,Should have kept White Zombie together,"The post-White Zombie gets off with a whimper. Overproduced to the point it is a bad parody of what White Zombie did well and way too techno for a guy who put together the best metal album of the 90's in La Sexorcisto. I tried to like it, truly, but after several spins of the CD it just wasn't very good. It starts off excellent with two very good songs but after that--very little of interest. Two stars one for each quality song."
1,humor me.,"OH MY GOD YOU PPL! rob zombie ranks 4.5 stars? i dont see how that can happen -- this cd is totally hollow, has bad music, the lyrics are the worst ive ever heard on ANY cd -- ""dead i am the one, exterminating son | slippin thru the trees, strangling to breeze | dead i am the sky, watchin angels cry | while they slowly turn, conquering the worm""? thats not even the worst , just check out demonoid phenomenon or superbeast. ugh. beg you dont waste ur money on this freakshow. rob zombie's a joke. a bad joke. im outta here."
1,You call this METAL !!!!,"I picked up ZOMBIE the other day and wasn't impressed! I thought that Rob would take command with more brutal chorus and harmonizing skills as once were displayed in such epics like ""After the Rain "" by NELSON or ""To Hell with the Devil"" by STRYPER. Sorry guys, you didn't do it this time. But to all you hardcore thrashers I recommend the latest from C.C. Deville or Kip Winger. They complete the circle that brought POWERMETAL to it's final level!"
3,Any other time would have gotten 5 Stars,This is possibly one of the greatest albums I've ever listened to everything about it is crafted to make a gigantic thrashing machine. However I could not bring myself to give the first Rob Zombie solo album 5 Stars simply because of what he did to his former group. He ditched White Zombie his former group which was one of the greatest groups ever. He thought he was good enough to move on but he wasn't. If he hadn't abandoned his old group this album would have easily recieved 5 Stars cause it just thouroughly kicks ass.
5,The Best and some suggestions,"Buy it if you haven't, Rob Zombie is the best. If you like this one check Testament. Specifically Testament:The Gathering. This one is a must buy also. They don't get enough credit but with their new album they definetly deserve some. If you like metallica, you'll love this cd. Old school metallica with up to date instruments."
4,ROB Zombie shockingly good!!!,"Rob Zombies' hellbilly deluxe is a great hard rock album. The cd has several great songs such as Dragula, Living dead girl, superbeast, and others. I really like it and all rock fans will, i think!!"
4,THIS GUY IS SMOKIN'!Great riffs and lyrics. .,"Not since early Alice have I heard lyrics this disturbing. Although He plays with a new style and itensity,it's really starting to grow on me.I think Rob will go far now that he has seperated from his anchor chain."
5,I'd give it 6 stars if I could,About 97% of this cd is excellent I especially enjoyed Superbeast(track 2
4,"Good Cd, just too short!","Well, I really love this CD. And I really wish I could give it 5 stars. But I can't. The problem is that it is waaay to short. Around 35 minutes I think. But still, buy it because it is awesome. Of course, it could be the new White Zombie record for all the difference there is between it and WZ recordings, but who cares! It's still good old Rob Zombie!"
5,this CD rocks cause of the heavy music and sweet lyrics,if you loved white zombie you have to buy this CD.the heavy music of the classic white zombie mixed together with the perfect sound of rob.as a first solo album this a da bomb.
3,Good But Not the Best,"Alright it was good but way too short. Plus a lot of the songs on this cd were just plain dumb, Songs like: Perversion 99, How to make a monster, What lurks on Channel X, all could have been done away with. Even then the cd doesn't have the Zombie quality. All these people claiming this cd is the best probably didn't follow Rob's career when he was with White Zombie. White Zombie was much better and Much heavier. Yeah Blasko and Riggs can play their instruments but J. and Sean Yseult were the best. Rob made a big mistake with letting them go. He could have gone solo and kept the former band members. Besides Rob Zombie was White Zombie. If you want to hear Rob at his best Get White Zombie's Astro-Creep 2000, It's much heavier and better listening."
2,Wow,"There are a few entertaining songs on this album,but it gets old fast. The first three tracks get your hopes up, but after that, everything is repetitive and weak. This doesn't deserve the label of heavy metal. Rob Zombie has sold out."
3,Is this good heavy metal?,"Is it fair to rate this album purely on the merits of it being music or does one have to confine the discussion to purely comparisons to other heavy metal bands? On the music front, this horror-schlock stuff is silly; and none of it scary in the least. On the metal front, it's a wall of guitar grundge sound. Typical, but not too interesting. I liked the in-depth booklet, but the booklet doesn't inspire. I can't tell anything about Rob Zombie's politics, angle, or what really fuels their fire. The album's an extended joke that lacks real heart and soul. It's inventive heavy metal, and I give the band credit for having some fun, but ultimately, the music doesn't inspire either."
5,"DAAAAANG, Can This be real","WOOOOOOOOW!!!! Impossible! All you veiwers out there this cd isso awsome you'll want to listen to it all the time. I listen to a lot of music like P.O.D, Linkon Park, Creed, 3 Doors Down, and a whole lot more. But the best is ROB ZOMBIE. NO cus words ,no nothen exept for rocking tight songs and phat PHAT music. You have to buy this baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad CD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,cadaverous cavorting?,This has 13 complete videos. Some CD/DVD thing I have has less videos. Only bad thing is the entire thing runs in full tv screen mode with no viewing options. so you get black bars on the left and right.
3,this cd is ok if you like hard core rock buy this cd,this cd has many great songs but it has also songs which have no point and don't have any beats or sound that cathchs the ear if you like hard core rock this is a must have if you are like me and would like to expirement with others types of music then you are used to this cd will be definatly diffrent but fun to listen too. i would recomend this cd to everyone who likes rock and suggest it to people who don't listen to much rock.
3,Good CD with few problems,"I have just listened to this cd which I borrowed from a friend it is pretty good some songs are weak and dumb like perversion 99,how to make a monster. But the other songs are pretty good but after the first 3 songs the quality of songs gets a little lower, it is very short only about 35mins. I will probaly buy it soon. I recommend it if you like white zombie or other metal bands. the 3 stars should be 3.5."
2,Off to a good start but peters out at the end,"This album follows the increasingly common pattern of hooking people with three good songs on the radio and then neglecting the rest of the album.Hellbilly Deluxe starts off strong with its radio hits Superbeast, Dragula, and Living Dead Girl, but the remaining ones are shoddy work."
3,good but absolutely no variety,"This cd basically consists of one great song played over and over and over, with minor variations and title changes each time. Every time I play it, I get blown away by the first song. Blown away by the second song. By the time the third song comes around, I'm thinking ""haven't I just heard this?"", then as the cd progresses I become increasingly certain that I have. Over and over and over. It's rare for me to make it all the way through to the end."
2,Too overrated...,"I don't know what all the hype is about. This CD sounds like a soundtrack for a cheesy horror movie. I am really disapointed by Rob on this one. White Zombie used to play kick @$$ heavy metal, this is way different from the old Zombie. How can anyone even be amused by this CD? Sorry, but the lyrics are horrible, the singing isn't very great, and this CD just plain isn't worth it. If you want a real Zombie CD, buy AstroCreep 2000."
4,This CD rules!,Its a great Cd but not all the songs are all that great. Dragula rules but the call of the Zombie is a rip-off but still its a great CD to get and hes way better than white Zombie
4,"""Burn through the witches...""","I've been trying to get this CD for the longest time! ""Dragula"" is the BEST song. I put the CD on repeat and blast it! All my friends love Rob Zombie too."
4,This CD Rules!,"Ok i bought this having no idea what the hell to expect, but when i threw it in my player, IT TOTALLY BLEW ME AWAY, i mean the lyrics are insane plus they have the heaviest catchyst tunes possible to metal. My only crit would be that the cd is only 38 mins long!"
3,Not as good as White Zombie,Its an okay cd but its too industrial to keep me listening to it I get bored with it after about the fourth song. The only song that I really like to listen to is The Ballad of Resurrection Joe and Rosa Whore.
2,UG! But if you must own....,"This is your typical Rob Zombie outing. Sounds very much like his old band White Zombie. There are two great songs (Dragula and Superbeast), and the rest is pretty poor. It is no wonder to me that most of Zombie's concert material consisted mostly of old White Zombie tunes. This is perhaps because he knows that material is better than this. But if you must own this c.d. get the explict version. The edited edition is missing about half of the material in the c.d. jacket and the lyrics are missing. Also the music is edited. Swears and ojectional phrases have been deleted. Therefore compromising Mr. Zombie's artistic vision. This is not a great album, but is worth getting for Dragula and Superbeast. Makes you think, ""If I had a dime for every time Rob Zombie said Baby...."" If you want great Zombie, buy Astro Creep 2000 instead."
4,AWESOME,REALY GOOD CONSIDERING THAT THE GROUP LEADER OF WHITE ZOMBIE TURNED SOLO. REALLY GOOD CD INCLUDING MANY GOOD TRACKS. QUITE A LOT OF SWEARS THOUGH!
5,This is one great album.,This is a great cd. I liked almost every song. This is probably one of the best (if no the best) album I own.
5,SPOOKY BUT FUN.,ARE YOU KIDDI'N ME.ZOMBIE RULES.THIS IS THE BEST ALBUM HE HAS DONE.OK THE WHITE ZOMBIE YEARS WERE COOL BUT THIS IS BETTER.
4,It Creeps up on you...,"I was put-off by Zombie's latest though I loved 'Dragula' & 'Phantom Stranger'. Then I found myself playing 'Spookshow Baby', 'Living Dead Girl',etc. in my head. Rob Zombie's 'Hellbilly Deluxe' just creeps into your soul with its infectious heavy metal-techno-pop grooves. It may not be 'Astro-Creep 2000, but hey, what is?"
5,A review by A big fan of Rob's,This has got to be the best album that rob zombie has put out with or without white zombie. It has all the things everyone looks for in a zombie album.
4,Superb metal cum techno stuff !!,"I heard the entire CD and it just kicks ass !! The production on this album is really brilliant. I just LOVE the awesome guitar sound !! Rob did some really cool stuff here and John Tempesta is sure one helluva drummer !! The songs are really catchy and groovy, but the techno touches are just one too many for me. However, this still stands out as one of the best metal releases I've heard this year !! If you love White Zombie, you'll love this baby !! But if you're a diehard metal freak, you still might wanna give this a try!!"
3,zombies best,1)call of the zombie-5/5 (i luv this intro)2)superbeast-5/53)dragula-5/54)living dead girl-5/55)perversion 99-3/56)demonoid phenomenom-5/57)spookshow baby-3/58)how to make a monster-2/59)meet the creeper-3/510)the ballad of resurrection joe-2/511)what lurks on channel x-2/512)return of the phantom stranger-3/513)the beginning of the end-2/5the beginning of this cd is awesome but the end leaves much to be desired45/65
4,Great CD,"Really good hard rock but it got over way too quick. Superbeast, Dragula, and Lving Dead Girl started this cd off with a killer beat and lyrics but it died down by the end."
4,Better than I had hoped,"I borrowed this album from a friend because he said I would like it. I think I said something like ""Hmmm... Right.."" As it (fortunately) turned out, I DID like this album. Dragula is one of those mondo loud songs that gets stuck in your head at inconeinient times (The End of Course test in English III, for instance), Living Dead Girl is totally cool, and I can listen to Superbeast six or seven times in a row and not get tired of it.The remaining songs were mostly generic filler, but they were GOOD generic filler. They're sure better than that 'teenbopper' crap that dominates the radio, anyway.All in all, not a bad solo album."
4,awsome,"this is a great cd, i've never heard rob's music before but he really is good.but there were a few bad ones like how to make a monster and the beginning of the end.everything else was great!! especially return of the phantom stranger, i only listened to the cd 2 times sofar cause i got it today (12/3/01) but i love phantom stranger so much i've already listened to it more times than i can count."
3,welcome to the freak show,"rob zombie is a freak,and thats why we love em.i like only 3 songs on this:superbeast,dragula,living dead girl)but their all awesome.i like them.but isnt he kinda obssesed with dead girls and horror movies?i mean,theres a song called living dead girl! and the horror movies:superbeast,the call of the zombie,what lurk on channel x?...but still,this is a good cd. ..."
4,"Rob Zombie is awsome, but a bit repetitive","I think this is a great cd and Rob Zombie is awsome, but only about half of this cd is any good and the rest seems a litle boring and mediocre to the rest. Dragula, Living Dead Girl, SuperBeast, Demonoid Phenomenon, Spookshow Baby, and The Balled of Resurrection Joe and Rosa Whore are all Good. The rest just seem a little under par. I wish I could give this cd 3 and a half, but it was closer to 4 then 3. If you like Powerman 5000, Korn, or Static-x you should get this. If you like this, then buy Supersexy Swingin' Sounds by White Zombie."
2,Spookshow antics are less amusing than obnoxious,"Most people who liked Astro-Creep seem to have enjoyed Hellbilly Deluxe, so I certainly can't recommend White Zombie fans to not buy this album. Still, here's why I didn't like it: I enjoyed the pumping, furious pace of Astro-Creep, which is nowhere to be found in Hellbilly. In the latter, the ""scary"" melodramatics added a humorous touch to an intense, energizing experience. In Hellbilly, the creepy facade is all that seems to be present in the repetitive, ho-hum songs. Sure, Zombie's lyrics have never really meant anything...it's all about the music. But any decent tunes on this CD seem to be repeated so mercilessly that I can barely resist skipping to the next song just for something new. I miss White Zombie."
5,"A great mix of darkness, music, catchy riffs and a zombies","Okay, so you've heard the word from Russia, you've heard what the church has to say, now its Rose Tender's turn (Thats me). First of all, who gives a damn what Rob believes? I don't even believe in the devil so whatever, but if Rob does believe in satan I'm sure he has his reasons to. Thats not important, whats important is that this is a good listen. It flows nicely and goes good in background if you want to hang out in your room or something. He's got a good flavor to his lyrics, and some of the songs are really good, mainly Living Dead Girl, Superbeast and Dragula. Then there is the instrumental ""Perversion"" which is also quite different. Here's to Rob for trying something solo and successfully being well over suck."
2,It's pretty good..........for the first week anyway,"Okay, when I first got the cd, I couldn't stop listening. I went over every track a million times. After about the first week though, I started listening less & less until I just plain stopped. Now it's just sitting around gathering dust. I still like the witty lyrics and freakish guitar riffs, but it isn't all it's cracked up to be. I might occasionally listen too ""Call of the Zombie"" for a laugh, but thats it. But, it's still pretty good, at least for the first week."
5,Slaves of the Mastery,"I got this book a couple of days ago and I enojoyed reading it. I would recommend this book to 7th and 8th graders. It was a book that I couldn't put down. The characters were the best, but they didn't have alot of description. They did have alot of emotion and feel. My favorite character Mumpo was odd but kind hearted. I also loved the setting of the book. Its such a beautiful and wonderful place. This is book perfect for enjoyment and as a book report. I really liked the book but the beginging was alittle bit on the down side. The middle and end was great. I hope everyone who reads this review also reads the book. This book was a number one book because of its emotional feel on me and its a very addicting to read. I can't wait to read the next book. Remember never judge a book by its cover."
5,Wonderful Sequel. A Fabulous must Read!!!!,"When I read sequels I tend to find that the original flare of the first book is just not there anymore, but in this case the sequel was just as great or even better than the first. I think this is a must read. You must read the first one first though otherwise you won't understand what is going on in the story. In this book Kestral is seperated from Bowmen and they both growup a lot. Please try this book it is one of a kind."
2,Shocked at the dark content!,"I thoroughly enjoyed the first book in this series so I was eager to read the second. I was dismayed at the dark turn this book takes. From the intentional burning of people to keep others in line, to the manaxa dances in which men wear knives and ""dance"" against an opponent with the ""hopes"" of inflicting injury and/or a kill, to the end of the book where the dejected suitor intentionally slashes a character's face in anger to destroy her beauty, this story is violent start to finish. There is also an erotic undercurrent with the wedding dance that must be performed by two of the main characters. Overall, I was disappointed in the tone of this book, especially for the age group it appears to be directed towards, (the back of the book recommends ages 9-11). I think the recommended age should be at least 13-17."
5,electronica is a difficult genre to master,"Electronica is a difficult genre to master, but Mr. Pappa shines on this album. It is truly so well integrated. The mood is very mellow, introspective and spiritual. It's an album you can push play on and listen to from start to finish without skipping ahead."
4,Gunfighter An Autobiography,"If you like a none stop , tell it in the first person account , then this is a good one to get. Mr Hardin just rights it down as he remembers it. You decide if he's telling the truth or not. The book jumps around alot, and some things are repeated from time to time, but not so it's confuseing. No chapters, just a man righting it down as he recalls it.I liked it. Bountyhunter."
5,cute,Works perfect for what I wanted. Background is black but looks good since my back window is black tint. Its been up for a year now & still looks brand new. No peeling or fading.**Caution: Make sure its placed in the right spot... peeling it off to move is very hard to do without ripping.
4,"Not decals, but cute","To begin with, these are not decals - they're stickers. Decals are much more durable on a car, but for the price I don't mind, I'll just replace them when they die. But the seller should make that clear in the description.Several other reviewers have described these as white figures on a black sticker, but the ones I got are white figures on a clear sticker. Not sure how you're supposed to tell which you're getting. The clear ones were perfect for me, as I put them on a rear window.They are pretty cute though, and I like that this set comes with 2 cats and 2 dogs - most only come with one of each."
5,people stickers,these are so cute i got them for my dad for Christmas as a joke so i haven't seen how well they stick. but they arrived on time and the packaging was fine :)
2,Cute but not sure worth the money,"For the money I would have expected this to be more professional looking. As is, it looks like something bought at a dollar store.Looking at the picture associated with the product, one would expect to receive a flat package titled 'Decal Kit' as shown. Instead I recieved the decals which appear cut from a larger sheet, between two pieces of cardboard, wrapped in black plastic and tons of tape. This was bought as a gift for my sister and there was no way I was sending it as is to her. I had to come up with a creative way to package it.The decals themselves are cute, and I hope my sister enjoys them."
2,Those are not good,"The kids all almost the size of adults, you can get better ones out there. However they do the job if you already have them!!!"
2,Not for the would-be novelist,"Relatively easy to read and contains some useful strategies for article writers. However, strategies are not all that useful for those writing longer works. It remains on my reference shelf, but I doubt if I will ever get much out of it"
1,"It's Not ""Night""","Elie Wiesel is stuck in Buchenwald. The book keeps harking bsack to his days in the concentration camp. This is understandable, but his musings about the past interrupt the flow of his writing which was smooth decades ago in ""Night."" It is not smooth here. I stopped reading after about 50 pages because Wiesel had trouble getting into the story."
5,Camber kit,well the camber kit is awesome very good quality well worth the price. For the price its just as good as any other camber kit out there
4,Interesting epic...,"Very good, but the international production causes some weak points. It seems as though too many people making this spoke too many different languages. No matter how you alter the audio settings, the dialogue will not sync up."
5,A truly great movie!,"If you want to know what 20th century history is from a European or Italian point of view, you ought to see this film.If you want to just enjoy an impressive story about three generations, love, hatred, loyalty and betrayal, you ought to see ths film.Heimat - Chronicle of GermanyHeimat II: A Chronicle of a GenerationHeimat, Vol. 3: A Chronicle of Endings and Beginnings"
3,Too Long at 5 1/2 Hours,"Whoever decided to release this film onto DVD at it's 5-1/2 hour length should have their head examined.At four hours, 1900 is a brilliant, totally engossing film.At 5-1/2 hours, it becomes a bore.The sad thing is that, unlike movies like ONCE UPON A TIME IN AMERICA, none of the added footage contributes anything significant to the film. The vast majority of the running time simply extends scenes that are already there.Do we really need to watch a pig being slaughtered on-screen?Hopefully,in the future, Paramount will release the 4 hour version of this classic, so that we can enjoy it once again."
1,Rattle on Arrival,"I was really looking forward to watching this film, and the package that arrived was rattling. I opened the dvd case and the second dvd was out of it's slot and completely scratched!I need to return this item for a full or a resend from amazon.com, because i still am yet to watch 1900."
1,a waste of time,"who wouldn't want to check out a historical epic directed by Bertolucci (whose ""Last Tango in Paris"" and ""Conformist"" are terriffic and thought-provoking), and starring Lancaster, Sterling Hayden, De Niro, Depardieu, etc.? Don't waste your time. This film has all the earmarks of a ""genius"" director's overinflated vision, a grand statement, and as such is totally contrived and UNreal, from the behavior of the actors, which is ludicrously like a grade-B horror movie, to the script, the editing, and the story itself. We are whacked over the head with many socialist cliches about the wonderfulness of peasants and the decadent cruelty of the ruling classes, and the romantic drama is boring, boring, boring. Even the music by Morricone was used awfully! I was laughing out loud. A mess. What a disappointment! The ending is the epitome of ridiculousness. Sorry."
2,"Has moments of brilliance, but still highly over-rated.......................","The camerawork and some of the acting are stunning, but the staging of many scenes are laughable. Inparticular, check out the ludicrous ""sex"" scene between De Niro, Depardieu, and Stefania Cassini--beyondembarassing............"
2,Bertolucci Deserves Better,"Many versions of Bernardo Bertolucci's ""1900"" have existed. It had been cut by Bertolucci (and others) even before it debuted theatrically. This version from Paramount home video is not the full-length version Bertolucci would like everyone to see, but it is superior to some far shorter versions that have existed. ""1900"" is not Bertolucci's best film, but it has its moments for those with patience to sit through a dramatically and politically rich epic from a cinematic master. However, the picture quality is a major disappointment. It is not letterboxed and the picture quality is so poor it looks like a 16mm print transferred to video. A master visual stylist like Bertolucci and two-time Oscar-winning cinematographer Vittorio Storaro deserve far better."
4,Good price for a full featured movie,"I haven't even looked into the extra features, but this is the least censored version of Bertolucci's 1900 that I have seen. I love the fact that you can use the orginal Italian audio with English subtitles. I think that the French dubbing may be a little superfluous for a region 1 disc. I know that the film has been dubbed into several other languages, so I wonder why French was the other language included. I was also a little disappointed that the movie was split into 2 discs. I am not an expert on the DVD medium, but I thought that it was feasible to put the entire film on a single disc and not lose very much in the way of quality. Maybe the additional copy protection is causing the disc information to be more bloated than even a single dual-layer disc can contain. Still, this 2 disc set has everything I would want in this film plus more."
4,wonderful insights,"Verghese is now known for Cutting for Stone, but his non-fiction is where he developed the ability to express the physicians point of view towards life and healing. This is a gem!"
5,Abraham Verghese does it again!,I was moved by this book as much if not more than his first. While I was reading it felt as if I was there with Dr. Verghese. His writing is so expressive that you can actually visualize being in the hospital as well as the streets of his town. And he showed that men care for other men as deeply as women care for other women. Much respect for Dr. Verghese it saddened me to near the end of his book due to the fact that I knew it would soon be over. I look forward to the next book from Dr. Abraham Verghese.
1,A friendship?,"I am amazed that someone can consider type of relationship discribed here to be one of very close friends....the book title more aptly displays the depth of feeling, in my opinion. This book might be enjoyed by someone who adores tennis; as one who has no specific interest in it, those long segments of the book have no appeal...they might as well be discussing bowling...anything physical. This allows the writer to skirt issues instead of allowing close human interaction. I am amazed that what most women would consider an aquaintance, this writer considers to be a close (only?) friend. I think he has emotionally arrested development, though he seems kind, and most likely is an able physician."
4,more of A Verghese,"The Tennis Partner is, in some ways, more revealing of the author than even My Own Country, which I liked a bit better. But for the reader who has found Cutting for Stone an addictive read, this is also worth the time."
4,A great read for tennis players,"I am in the medical field, and a tennis player, so I naturally loved the book, as there were many parts that were interesting to me. Not really a book for non-tennis players though."
1,Disappointing,"I was really disappointed by this book. I continued to read it, thinking it would improve. I was so impressed by cutting for stone that I was expecting the same level of writing. However, the story dragged on and was almost predictable."
5,book club required,i loved this book and it got xcellent reviews at my book club meeting... great price for a very well written book
3,The Tennis Partner,"It was very well written, as all of his books are, but a little too technical for me. But good subject."
2,a big disappointment,"I had looked forward to this book, expecting an inciteful analysis of friendship and drug addiction. I loved ""My Own Country"", and lookd forward to enjoying this book as much. I was sorely disappointed; irritated by travel book descriptions of El Paso, smug case histories of patients, egocentric self-analysis of the author's relationship with others. I found little to explain WHY the two men were friends, outside of being tennis buddies, and almost no incite to the problems faced when a friend has a drug addiction. Perhaps my expectations were too high, you can't always hit a home run."
2,"Tells us something, but perhaps not what the author intended","I found ""The Tennis Partner"" disappointing because ultimately Dr. Verghese has little insight into his friend's heart or mind. The use of his friend's life as a taking-off point seems exploitative. The repetitive passages on Dr. Verghese's self-described insightful diagnostic methods and his obsessive meanderings about tennis strike me as simply egocentric. That the book derived from journal musings is all too clear. It is marred as well by some writing errors, for example, the feeling that his head was caught ""in a vice."" It does serve as a warning about the misshaping of the person that can take place in the medical pressure cooker, but I believe not, ironically, in the way the author intended."
1,Disappointed Fan,"I had read ""Cutting for Stone"" and loved it! I actually purchased multiple copies and gave them to my daughter and two friends. I also recommended it to many of my patients. I found The Tennis Partner to be self-indulgent---more of an autobiography than a novel. The first chapter was a grabber--totally fascinating-- and then it was downhill from there. I finished it because I kept waiting for it to improve based on the Cutting for Stone novel which had incredible dimension. I felt that the characters in The Tennis Partner lacked depth but it did educate me about drug addiction in physicians."
3,Depressing,"If life's been a bowl of cherries, but you're curious about the pits, read this. I've played tennis for 40 years, seen plenty of addiction and mental illness, but found this book -- though well-written -- in the end, simply depressing."
4,More than tennis,"The tennis metaphor may be a bit excessive, but the story and the writing are the natural step from My Own Country to Cutting For Stone. Verghese is a wonderful story teller who only gets better in Cutting for Stone. The mysterious and cunning disease of addiction is explored in this book. As another book states, addiction is""...cunning,baffling, and powerful."" The deception of the addict not only breaks his own spirit, but also the spirits in those around him. The reader meets the tennis player, watches and learns from him, then sadly shakes his/her head at the choices of an addict/liar. Verghese faces some sad truths about his own life as well and gives the reader a sanitized version of his own pain and denial."
4,The compassionate heart of the doctor again takes control of,"The compassionate heart of the doctor again takes control of his pen just as it did in his first book,MY OWN COUNTRY. Having been in situations where an addiction has ended a treasured friendship, I was touched by the doctor's story of bonding and loss, of the hard work of relationships and the failure that might follow successes. This is a powerful story of two men connected by a game that is of life as well as tennis; the deep ties that so often are typical of women but rarely are they seen between men; the struggles of each man to hang on to the value of life built between them. It is not often such a deep sense of love is so sensuously described except by women between women."
4,Addiction and Medicine,"I have read both of Dr. Verghese's other books and while I think both of those are more moving to me personally, I appreciate the reality told through fiction of this book. The focus of this book is on a medical student, David, who has a drug addiction problem and Dr. Verghese's failing marriage. Together the two become fast-friends and find a common bond in tennis. Their ""ritual"" of tennis becomes what stabilizes one but cannot help the other. The parts of the story that I personally found most moving and were that even as medical professionals, those dearest friends to him were still somewhat able to overlook the symptoms that David was exhibiting to potential relapse. It was a true description of the consequences of drug-addiction, what it does to the body, what medical complications occur, and the lifestyle. Overall the story was obviously emotional to share even in semi-fiction and I think many readers can appreciate that."
4,A great read,"I am currently a training physician at Texas Tech Univeristy in El Paso, where this story took place, and it really hits close to home. I picked it up and couldnt put it down. Really an amazing and heartbreaking story. Dr Verghese came to lecture recently and that was what motivated me to read his book. He is truly a scholar who is a master in the arts and sciences, a very compassionate physician and a great teacher."
3,"Easy to read, honest, compassionate.",A. Verghese has once again come up with a compassionate book with a style of writing that seems to flow with great ease. He is very honest with his feelings but his characters do not develop as much as one would want them to. I seemed to read the book more from a wife's perspective and empathized more with Ragini than with Verghese. I hope she has had as cathartic an experiece as he has seemed to have had with writing his two books. This book may get doctors to be more in touch with their feelings and could perhaps lead to the formation of support groups to help them deal with the issues they have to face everyday at the hospitals. Looking forward to his next book which I guess he is probably working on already.
3,Thought provoking examination of personal relationships,"This was an interesting emotional read about a man evolving emotionally through his relationships. Unfortunately, the first part of the book is very slow until the tennis partner, David, discloses his personal weakness. As a tennis player with no interest in medical study, I learned quite a lot. The payoff of the emotional ending is worth the read. This book is not entertaining but thought provoking and guaranteed to make you evaluate your personal relationships and interaction with loved ones."
2,Disappointing book from a good writer,"The author of My Own Country seems to have lost his touch. Nowhere in The Tennis Partner do you see the same charm or honesty. His prose continues to be elegant, and his images vivid. But this story is simply not as compelling as the one he had to tell in My Own Country. The fatal flaw in The Tennis Partner is that you never really understand the basis of the friendship between the doctor and David. What, besides tennis, did they have in common? David is Verghese's intellectual inferior and the doctor's fascination for him is puzzling. Another problem is the structure of the book. He juxtaposes long italicized segments on tennis that have nothing to do with anything, with themes of drug addiction, medicine, loneliness, marital breakdown, David's relationships with women, and travel-book descriptions of El Paso. The book simply does not cohere. I hope Dr. Verghese can give us more in his next book."
4,A Guy Book,"If there were an Oprah's Book Club for Men, this book would be the first selection. Why? Because Dr. Verghese explores the murky world of male-male platonic friendships much in the way ""Oprah Books"" look at the female-female relationship. It's a beautifully written, and extremely honest, treatment of how men relate to one another and how their friendships are born and nurtured. Unlike many of Oprah's selections, however, this one is not beach reading. Rather, it is a book to be savored, and a book which will make you think."
3,Sophomore slump?,"While not a bad read, ""The Tennis Partner"" lacks the vision and purpose of Dr. Verghese first book, the remarkable and extraordinary ""My Own Country."" It isn't just the sometimes long winded passages about tennis (which can easily be skimmed over without causing the reader to lose touch with the overall narrative) that make this less interesting, it is simply that the subject matter comes across a bit more ego driven at times.Granted Dr. Verghese's compassion for his drug addicted friend is most evident, but the purpose in relaying this story sometimes comes across as more for the purposes of writing a second book, whereas ""My Own Country"" clearly had a story that needed to be told.""The Tennis Partner"" is still a decent read, and perhaps it is unfair to expect a second book, or any book for that matter, matching ""My Own Country."" If the subject matter of ""The Tennis Partner"" appeals to you read it, but be sure to read ""My Own Country"" as well."
4,Intense,"I was caught up in the intense relationahip between the two doctors. Considering the author was one of the main characters, he was able to describe their life struggles very believably. Their emotional connection to tennis helped them thru their addictions and struggles."
4,Unusual memoir,"In THE TENNIS PARTNER, internist Dr. Abraham Verghese combines memoir with tennis lore and strategy, blended with the story of his deep fondness for a young intern who is a cocaine addict. That this young man is a fine medical student and an outstanding tennis player make the looming tragedy even more poignant. Dr. Verghese, whose novel CUTTING FOR STONE is for me one of the finest works of fiction in the last 50 years, can write anything he wants and I will be delighted to read it. His use of figurative language, his sentence structure, his pacing, well...it is all exactly right. If you have read Verghese's essays in The New Yorker, you probably know what I mean. If you haven't read CUTTING FOR STONE, what are you waiting for? Joan C"
3,Thought provoking examination of personal realtionships,"This was an interesting emotional read about a man evolving emotionally through his relationships. Unfortunately, the first part of the book is very slow until the tennis partner, David, discloses his personal weakness. As a tennis player with no interest in medical study, I learned quite a lot. The payoff of the emotional ending is worth the read.

5,We love this booooook!,"i read the bok it was real goood. we was a readin, andf there be some nasti perts! we kan relite too jefson cuz peopl be mean to we's"
3,when is the screaming going to stop,well after listening to 2 of there cd's the music is really good. they seem to be really talented. the singer is sounds good the only thing that is wrong with cd is the dude that screams out crap in the back round if they would get rid of him they could be really good.don't know whats up with all the bands screaming but it really sounds terrible.well gave this cd 3 stars because of the dude screaming.
5,"""Rock Solid"" In Oregon","I researched scanners for a week. And I live in Grants Pass,Oregon , About 50,ooo people, so I guessed right,no trunking devices. The Bearcat72xlt was a perfect choice. I downloaded the manual so it would be letter size. punched holes in it and put it in a binder. It was 63 pages long and gave perfect instructions what to do.I also downloaded the frequencys with no problem for my county. I live in Mountains and hilly country and programing was 10 times easyer than my mp3 player. I only installed 10 Frquencys in a 100 channel scanner. All are very clear!! My first scanner was in 1977 and was a crystal 8 channel scanner.This is my second and get ni-mh batterys. Do not pick this one for Nascar, It is the 4th from the top rated by Uniden..... Perfect choice For my needs!!!It has way more feauters than I need. I highly recomend this scanner!!!!!!"
1,Difficult To Use,I bought this for use at a race and was sorely disappointed. The volume was very weak when used with an intercom and headset. It is also extremely difficult to program and almost anything you do takes multiple steps using keys whose names make no sense and have no correlation to the function.
4,Good Buy,Great buy for your money.Easy to use with easy detailed product manuel.This product is perfect for the beginner scanner user.
4,Satisfaction for sure.,"I bought this scanner for a CHRISTmas gift. My son already owns one and this was for my daughter and son in law. They are thrilled with it. I also own a scanner, although mine is not a handheld. If I had to replace mine, this is the one I would get."
3,You get what you pay for,"I bought this last year sometime, i have it set to all the fire, ems, police, prison, school dist, just all the listed ones for my area. It picks up pretty good from far distances, I got about 15 miles out of farmington and it was still picking up the police dept clear. The only problem with this is sometimes it will not pick up anything for like 20 minutes at a time even when Im home in town. All in all pretty good buy."
4,Just What He Wanted,It was exactly what I was looking for and he was wanting. It picks up a lot of activity in our area. It was even in my price range. Was very happy to get it so quickly. Love that it is portable and the batteries last a very long time.
1,Would not buy!,I have this scanner. The instruction manual is not well written nor is it at all helpful. We have never been able to get this scanner to pick up the channels we programmed into it. This is not our first scanner and we are not new to programming one. Money wasted!
4,Great Scanner for beginners,"This is a great scanner for beginners, the reason why I say for beginners is that it doesn't go upto the 800mhz frequencies. And it all depends on your area, but where we leave the ground channels, when a fire box/alarm hits it goes to the ground station which is in teh 800 frequencies so guess what we can't get it on this radio. But the sound is great, and it's a perfect size and works wonderfully. Easy to program and easy to use."
1,junk from manufacture,this factory serviced unit just stopped working out of nowhere.squelch button dont work. contacted uniden to have them fix it and they want 60.00do not but uniden junkgoto radioshack and but the pr-107 much nicer scanner and all you do is input your zipcode
3,"Nice product, but some problems.","This is a great little scanner for the price. It is compact, and has the basic features one would like in an inexpensive scanner. Its main flaw, however, is its cryptic, difficult user interface. It suffers the same problem as other devices, which for size or economic reasons, have limited user controls (buttons). This means that keys double in functionality, and the user must activate different ""modes"" for accomplishing various tasks. This makes this unit somewhat tricky to use. As others have pointed out, the user manual leaves a lot to be desired.I'm happy with this scanner, and would recommend it to anyone who wants a basic, inexpensive unit."
1,Does't pick up squat,"I am a firefighter and bought this scanner to listen to other stations. The scanner never picks up any chatter on any of the setting i.e. police, air, fire or marine. The other day I received a fire call, my scanner was sitting right next to my pager and didn't pick up the call. The scan mode stops on blank channels all the time no matter where I have the squelch set. I am very disappointed in this scanner."
1,"Terrible, don't waste your money!","I made the mistake of wasting my money on this. When it failed, I was told I needed to return it and that this happens all the time! Don't waste your money on this. This is a piece of junk!"
4,police scanner,"despite the back-up with the ice and all the snow,it arrived in good shape and works great ,,,,,, 30 days and not turned off yet picks up 3 counties clear"
4,Great Buy,"I never owned a scanner and wanted to try it out. I received my Uniden BC72XLT scanner just yesterday and I was well pleased.It is small in size but picks up m any channels in my area (I'm up to about 30 channels so far).With help of instructions I was able to program scanner easily.I've been able to listen in on Police, Fire, Air, and Ham frequencies so far.For the price I paid for this item I am pleased. I am glad item came with A/C adapter also.A good start for anyone."
3,Works,"Works great. We use it at the airport to learn the airplane talk around the pattern. Like a lot of people have said, this thing works, and it's not hard to learn to use (if you read the manual), but products that get 5 stars are the ones that require *minimal* manual reference. This thing isn't very intuitive."
1,Run don't buy,"Run and don't buy this scanner. I had to return mine under the warranty it was so poor in quality. We used it for pleasure while sitting at the airport in the shadow of the tower and it wouldn't even pick up the tower frequency on scan. Poor, poor signal even as the plane taxied in front of us the signal was so scratchy, garbled it was nearly impossible to understand, also this scanner is impossible to program, you need a PHD degree and after awhile whatever was programmed it, disappeared! No way, big mistake, run, don't buy. We are still awaiting some kind of decision on what solution Uniden is going to come up with for us. Time is moving on and we don't have any scanner, but we listen to the Radio Shack of our friends, it's real nice."
1,Uniden BC72XLT HandHeld Scanner,I bought this scanner it only has 8 hrs of battery life! If you were planning to buy this scanner dont because its no good im going to be returning my scanner and getting every penny back! When despatch goes over the scanner all you can here is the person driving the emergency truck or car so you dont know were the street address is! Im Warning you not to buy this Scanner its poor! And in the middle of the night it will wake you up with some loud noise so if you dont want to be woke up because of some loud noise dont get this item!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,GREAT SCANNER,I USED THIS SCANNER THE SECOND IT CAME AND IT WORKED RIGHT AWAY..... IT TOOK LIKE FIVE MINUTES TO LEARN HOW TO USE BUT RIGHT AFTER THAT I WAS LISTENING TO POLICE FIRE AND EMS CALLS. THIS SCANNER IS SO MUCH FUN
1,Good price but not ready to use,I am sure it is a good product. I like to listen to the police and fire calls. Now if I could just find someone to set it up so I can use it.I have read the book and tried to follow the directions. At this time I am very frustrated and disappointed. Spend my money and time but have nothing I can get any use out of. Maybe some day I can find someone to set the radio up.
1,No Refund,I have not had the chance to get to use itbecause it was the wrong thing. But getting a refund is like pulling teeth.
1,Not what I expected,"I was shocked when this arrived and saw it was a "" NASCAR "" scanner. Granted the scanner may work wonderful, I will never know, and sure I could get a case to cover it, but I want this on my desk, I don't want to pay good money for a big surprise LOGO on the scanner.Not that im against Nascar, I just don't want it on my desk and on my scanner. They should of mentioned that in the ad.This one is going back."
2,Uniden handheld scanner,"I've spent hours scanning various channels and attempting to program the unit and had very little success. Other than NOAA (the weather channel) and a few moments of aircraft and ham chatter I received very little else. I searched online (with the websites suggested) for local police, fire and other local channels and monitored those with no success whatsoever. I went to a few local Radio Shack stores for assistance (since they sell the same unit) and that was a total waste of gas. I used to just purchase a crystal for a certain channel, plug it in my old bearcat scanner and done. I'm not saying there is anything wrong with the unit it just did not meet my expectations for a simple turn on and scan type unit."
1,Money Wasted,"I have gotten this being told my others i n the station, im a volunteer firefighter in a small town. it wont receive our signals, it skips over. I will not get this ever again."
2,Not bad.. But not good.,I used this product at a NASCAR race yesterday. Not very user friendly with the controls. Found it quite frustrating. Once I got it working was perfect.If I could do it over again I would purchase a more expensive model.
1,Very difficult to use,"Endured a 20 minute hold to tech support,then an hour with the unit trying to get it to simply scan the aircraft frequencies, I gave up and am returning it. It's far too difficult to use. The instruction book was probably written in a different country and is next to worthless. I am tech savvy - and this unit reminds me of working with DOS."
1,Scanner doesn't work,Product information did not reveal what bands this would receive - unfortunately not the one used in my part of the country.
3,"Dificult to program, ONLY Analog Signals","People must to know before buy:-Very dificult to learn programing and to use. Nothing intuitive.-Only Analog signals.Frequencys avaliable:25 - 55 Mhz FM(empty)108 - 136.9875 Mhz AM (air)(empty)137 - 174 Mhz FM(empty)406 - 512 Mhz FMPros:- Distances received above 150Km in 150Mhz, above 20Km in 490Mhz (tested)- Close call.- Small, very portable.- Only 2 x AA bateries or AC adaptor included.- MiniPlug standart 3.5mm (works all earphones)"
4,OK little scanner for the price.,"This is not a bad little scanner for the price. The only problem that I see with it is that the speaker is very small so the sound you get from it is not very loud. But it serves my purpose well, living in fire country in the Sierra Nevada Mts. of California."
1,Very difficult to use,"I purchased this item with the intention of listening to local PD and FD. After reading the manual several times, it still did not work properly. I even asked about 3 of my police officer friends to help and they couldnt get it to work.Not very easy to use and manual is very difficult to understand."
1,How in heck do you set this thing up ?,"This thing takes too much time to set up. Also, I don't need this many stations, I'm returning it this week."
4,Gary,"The input of frequencies is a bit complex, but once one gets used to it, it's easy. I really like the size and clarity of the sounds, as well as the range of pickup. Another plus is that it only uses 2 AA batteries."
2,Not properly equipped?,"We bought the scanners specifically to use at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway NASCAR races. Unfortunately we did not get much use out of them. After purchasing the codes needed at the track we found the reception to be terrible. We were told half way through the Sprint race by a person using a Radio shack brand scanner that we needed the shorter antennae for them. We were told that would eliminate that frequent static interruptions, and loss of the channel we were experiencing. It seems that since these are sold as 'NASCAR' scanners they would be equipped for NASCAR races. The instruction book could also be a little more 'understandable' then it is."
4,A good scanner,"This is the first scanner i have ever owned, and I must say its a good scanner. I bought it to listen to railroad communications mainly. I do listen to local police dept's (3 of them) and they all come in clear. I would say its a great scanner and the programming is not THAT hard, but it does take a little getting used to. Also, the antenna that comes with it can prove a little useless everyonce in a while, but i think thats with most of the scanners. So, if you buy a good antenna for this thing, it will work GREAT."
1,Save your money,Don't waste your money. I've been scanning channels for hours at a time and all all get is static. I did get the weather channel once. I scanned the complete range of channels on every bank and nothing. You have been warned.
4,Not a bad scanner for the price,"I bought this to replace an 10-year old 100 channel Uniden Handheld.My old one was great, but contacts and connections were starting to go bad.For the price, this is a really great unit. I don't think you can find a better 100 channel scanner for under $100USD.My only complaint is the small keypad, hence it makes programming tedius. Even a simple ""lock out"" involves a function key, then another key. Most won't need to re-program them very often and you can turn banks on and off by simply pressing the corresponding number.It uses the same NiMh AA batteries that came with my digital camera, so I didn't have to buy a new set for the scanner. They charge right in the unit with the included AC adapter."
2,Maybe it works...Maybe NOT!,i will be honest with this product...i live in Alabama - Mobile and i got the unit today.And i did some research about this product and my area too before i buy this device.Unfortunately this morning (before the UPS guy delivered the package) i figured out that the public safety in Mobile County use the Trunking System!And the only channel it picks is the Weather Channel.other than that no Air-Medic or Police channels can be listened with this device.I dont have a problem with the device but since it doesnt pick up any other channels even with Close call function or entering manually i cant tell you this device good or bad.It didnt work for ALABAMA - Mobile County AND if u looking for a device for listening Police units or Paramedic Talk....Than DO NOT BUY THIS UNIT....
4,Great product,"It's great to be able to carry it around with me. I was having trouble programming it, but that's all me. My only issue is it does not charge while plugged in. Other than that it's great."
5,Very pleased,"Amazon stated delivery would be on the 23rd and I received it today, the 20th. Very happy with this scanner. Easy to program. I was up and running 20 minutes after pulling it out of the box."
4,bearcat scanner,"The scanner is an excellent product, only bad thing is that the batteries run down really fast. I have not found a good set to install and use the wall charger to charge them. Other then that it is an excellent product. Great buy and fast shipping."
2,Wouldn'T buy again,Dose not work well out in the country and the buttons are so small for my husband to work with. It was used twice and finally just put it back in the box on the closet shelf.
4,Wish I could make some money,"I buy these to resell at my hardware store. Great product, but with what I pay, and what I can charge, the margin is slim. Also we would be more interested in not paying for NASCAR's endorsement on a scanner. Police and fire. That is it. Troy - Foster True Value"
4,MICKEY GOES WEST,"You've never seen such adorable critters as the ones found at the ""Roundup At Miss Minnie's Ranch."" However, you've probably never seen a book like ""Cowboy Mickey's Pop-Up Book of Games.""This eye-catching Western spoof contains four games with our favorite Disney characters decked out in chaps, spurs, and boots. Among otheres, there's a ""Chuck Wagon Race"" for two players in which the object is to be the first to reach Donald and Daisy Duck's chuck wagon.This is a Western free-for-all of fun for youngsters."
5,TWO GREAT GROUPS,"This DVD takes me back to the days when my wife and I used to catch every T-Rex concert we could (along with The Who of course!) when we were living and working in London. Their music has held up really well -- and so have we! Despite the cheesy psychedelic filming, this performance is really great, capturing Marc Bolan and Micky Finn at their best. But the real punch comes with the Roxy Music set -- Glam Rock at its best, with the glitter underlaid by sensational musicianship -- it's a set you must have. This is one of the best rock or pop DVDs yet issued, up there with the Roy Orbison Anthology, Eurythmics Greatest Hits, Bob Dylan's Don't Look Back, and the fantastic Doors 2-DVD anthology. But we're still waiting for what will be the greatest of all when the powers-that-be finally decide to release it -- a DVD of Bryan Ferry/Roxy Music's Greatest Hits -- our video is just about worn out!"
2,too little T.REX and too early Roxy,"After all how much TREX is available on video?gotta love it!Even with the strange but interestingly done (for the time)Double tracking (both video and audio)of Marc Bolin playing and singing on jeepster.Unfortunately the highlight and last TREX track, 20th century boy is lip synched. For those who dont know TREX will recognize the song from a recent automobile TV commercial.I give the TREX portion 4 stars.Now the Roxy section.........Too old and dated. There musicianship is lacking in the early years but it is interesting (to say the least)to see Brian Eno.also interesting is the clips are from multiple years so there are two iterations of the band. Of course Phil,Bryan, and Andy are great. But I saw Roxy live in 1977 and again in 2001 and they are so far superior than this DVD exhibits that if your not familiar with them this would not peak your interest to check them out. It will probably turn you completely off."
3,This order has me confused.,"I did receive the rollator and basket,but no tray. Does the basketcount as a tray or is the trayseparate?To whom would Iwrite about this order?I would give it a 5 if it werenot so confusing."
5,Great sewing book,This book is not only great for new beginners but also for those who have sewn for a while. It offers wonderful techniques in a step by step fashion.
3,ok,"What the other reviewers say about the text shrinking in newer editions. Maybe they think sewing is more like a hobby, than something people want to know a lot about. The section on reading patterns is ok. You need to know how to use a sewing machine, to use this book. Pictures are good."
3,For women only,"There's plenty of great general information in this, but for some reason it completely omits measuring and pattern alteration for men and children. The pages on these topics are specific to women and women's clothing. Very odd omission. I like the book as a reference, but it needs to be supplemented to address the shortcomings."
3,Not for beginners,"The book is too advanced for beginners. The book starts off assuming you know how to read and cut patterns, piece together parts, and construct clothing. It also assumes that you are very comfortable with using a sewing machine. The photographs are beautiful, but it hasn't served as a how-to manual that I had hoped. For the same retail price, you can buy at least two other better books."
2,Hard to use,"This book seems to have everything in it, but it sat on my bookshelf for years because everything was so hard to find. I finally sold it and moved on to other sewing books. I would recomment Sew Everything Workshop for a real beginner :)"
3,"Great for garments, not much else","I bought this largely to have as a referance book, and it will serve that purpose nicely, but almost entirely only for the sewing of clothing items. It has extensive diagrams for just about every clothing-related technique you could possibly need to know. However, the book only dedicates 10 pages to patchwork and quilting, and hardly even explains either of those. I don't even recall if it even mentions applique, and though it does have a few projects for pillow covers and curtains, it hardly talks about home decor at all. The clothing projects are very outdated styles, which is surprising for a 2002 edition (the styles are more early 90's, and not very flattering at all). Perhaps it would be more aptly titled Complete Guide to Garment Sewing or something along those lines. Still invaluable as a referance for clothsmaking, but certainly not 'complete' of all sewing types and techniques."
5,Sewing in the 21st Century,"After referencing the original (1976) Complete Guide to Sewing (Readers Digest) for 33 years, I decided to update my Guide when I updated my sewing machine - both new additions are wonderful! The New Guide has colorful illustrations and new techniques and tips I can access as needed. I highly recommend this excellent reference. My grandchildren's new duds will be spiffier than their parents' were."
5,New Edition Excellent product,"Very colourful book, good illustrations. I have an older edition but when I saw this new edition I wanted to see if there was anything new. I am so happy I made a decidion to purchase this product becasue it did have a lot more topics my older book. The diagrams are clear and explainations are good for both beginners or the advanced sewer. As a Fashion and Design Teacher for 20 yrs I find this book VERY helpful. I even bought an extra copy for on of my outstanding neew students as a gift."
1,Not what I expected,"I was so excited waiting for this book to arrive and, so disappointed after it did.I had recently bought a sewing machine and read all of the book reviews to assure that I would pick a book on learning to sew that fit my needs. I thought I had accomplished that after finding this one especially, after reading such positive reviews on it.I found this book very difficult to understand and it seemed to be written for people with an already vast knowledge of sewing and measurements. By Chapter two I was already confused and although I read, re-read still did not understand the basisc's of their explanation of measurements.This book is defantly not for beginners just wanting to learn how to sew nor is it for anyone looking to gain more knowledge on how to use their sewing machine."
4,This is the bible.,"I'm a fashion student, and this book is ""suggested reading."" Honestly if you don't have any prior history of sewing it may be a little difficult to grasp making it seem as if you have to have all this equipment and what-not. This book is an amazing source of information otherwise. This is like the bible."
4,Very helpful,"This is a very good reference book for those who want to learn about the basics of sewing, fabric choices, techniques, etc. It is always good to have a book to come back to on hand that goes through things step by step and makes things appear relativity simple to do.That being said, this is not a book that is easy to read (honestly not many sewing books are so gripping that you cannot put them down). The projects are - kind of boring and more challenging to a beginner.It's a good book to have lying around when you need help, I highly recommend it for that.And if you are looking for a book on how to sew with your sewing machine check out books like - Me and My Sewing Machine and Stitch by Stitch: learn to sew one project at a time. Both are very well written and go through the basics of sewing as well, it will be a lot of repetition, but for a beginner - like me - that is a good thing. Plus the projects are cuter and less overwhelming."
5,This is a great book,"My friend, who is an amazing seamstress and teaches sewing to others, recommended this book to me because I am a beginner. I think it has great basic ideas that you can chose to alter based on personal taste."
5,great book,"This book was recommended to me by one of the clerks at Mood, LA. Dont' be put off by the fact that it's from Reader's Digest. It's been the standard sewing text book for decades. It's been updated and covers, well pretty well everything a home sewer needs to know. It also easy to find the information when you're in the middle of a project and need to learn something new, need to check your skills or want an alternative way to do something. Great illustrations and easy to follow. Anyone relatively new to sewing needs this book."
4,sewing guide,"Sewing is a lost art but can save you a lot of money. My budget is tighter than ever and I needed to improve my sewing skills. This book is very helpful about taking the mystery out of sewing and helping to makes things look more professional and getting them done even faster. Whenever there is an instruction in a pattern that I do not understand, out comes this book and I learn exactly how to do it!! Do not hesitate to buy this book. I have an old sewing book that just wasnt as helpful. If this edition is anything like the one I have I recommend it without a pause. The book is easy to read with clear and concise illustrations with step-by-step instructions to walk through even a first-time sewer through an unknown step."
3,"It's OK, kind of overwhelming for the beginner",I decided to buy this book as a recommendation from a fashion blogger. She said it tells me exactly the type of fabric and notions I have to get for each project and it does which is great BUT it does not include the patterns to the projects (just the number so I go out an buy it) and there are no instructions on how to draft your own. I am an ABSOLUTE beginner and found myself overwhelmed with all the information included in the book; I wish it had more pictures/images (maybe because I'm more visual). I am not planning on completing any of the projects in the book since they don't seem attractive to me. I am not sorry I bought it; I think is a good book full of the basics that I can go turn to when in doubt.
4,Great sewing reference,"I am new to sewing, so I took a class at a local shop in town. The teacher recommended this book as the best one out there. I have only needed to use it once so far as an actual reference, but I needed guidance on pleats and it was very helpful."
3,not as good as past books,"I am an accomplished seamstress. I picked up a 1979 Readers Digest Complete Guide to Sewing at my library and found the slipcover chapter I was looking for. I thought the book was great. I looked on Amazon and found an updated version and ordered it. Well, no slipcover chapter, or curtain, drapes, etc. It's a great book, just not as chock full of info that it was in 79. I'd love to swap it for the 1979 version if anyone is interested."
2,What's Welsh for Zen is much much better,"I found this book listy, chock full of all the names he's worked with. Little insight beyond his autobiography except for some anecdotes of his bizarre behaviour and how hard it was to work with Cale along with some other bits like that Lou Reed said he like the song ""Hedda Gabber."" I would avoid this book because of the price and also because if you like Cale you like depth and experimentation and learning something really new and it's lacking here. However, if you want a decent chronology of his life rendered in a rather listy form, this is the book for you."
2,Not for everyone,"This book is small and easy to read. However it is not for everyone. Personally I read books to gain as much knowledge about a subject as I possible can. There are some good points in here. However, I ""personally"" disagree with some of the advice given. On Pg 70 the author suggests ""If ice cream is your weak spot choose low-fat,not low sugar versions. If you want to pig out now and again-it's much better to do it on jelly beans and hard candies rather than chocolate and potatoe chips."" I understand that sugar gives energy but for low blood sugar folks and diabetics this isn't really good advice. I personally feel like I am going to pass out when I eat any of that stuff, but I a feel full and okay when I eat a piece of cheese, meat, some salad, or an egg. I have 2 other books in this series but I think I will be previewing any other books in this series in the library (it needs my support anyway) first before purchasing any more"
5,Hawk's way Rogues,I love this author so I knew without a doubt that the book was going to be great. I also liked using your service because I have not been able to get the book in the stores.
5,"Great for ""I Love Lucy"" fans like me",What I especially liked about this paperdoll book compared to others that I have is that there is information about the show's wardrobe and how Lucy's look evolved during the run of the show. There are also lots of pictures showing Lucy wearing the outfits in different episodes of the show and that adds to it. I wouldn't buy this to cut up and actually use for the paperdolls because it should be saved. Ever since I got this book I look for the outfits when I watch the reruns on TV Land on the weekends.
3,Slow start,"This book doesn't take off like the first Nick Stone story, Remote Control. Compared to that book, this book seems to be moving in slow motion, like a day that just drags on. After the prelude, the ""real story"" doesn't have any hard action scenes until nearly page 200. The action is then not as gripping as Remote Control, hitting hard only in the final 50 or so pages, and after waiting so long to get to the action, it seems to wrap up too quickly."
4,very adequate,"this is another very adequate thriller by McNab. The plot and plotting seem more mature than in his first novel - which was good anyway. The writing style is relatively simple, but this makes this very much the ""normal man's thriller"", with good action, good macho thrills, women, fighting, none too taxing twists...(which are sometimes very welcome). McNab's use of cliches is also strangely endearing...Nick Stone is definitely a normal guy, doing and saying and acting in the way normal people do. He's a human character, and McNab develops him well. Sarah Greenwood, the woman he is sent by his superiors to hunt down is also a very strong presence in the novel...To anyone who wants good action, thrills, adequate writing and a human lead, coupled with a good plot, i would reccomend they give McNab try."
2,A good plot ruined by slang and expletives,"Andy McNab seems to have the details of special ops down, and the plot was superb. The characterization of Nick Stone is strong, and the story line is interesting.As my first introduction to McNab's writing, it was disappointing to see the text littered with so many unnecessary expletives and British slang. I'm no prude, but it was extremely distracting."
5,"Great,Great,Great!",Just Great!the tension in this book is incredible and you're wondering if the events are real or close real.One of the best books i've ever read.
2,Ultimately Boring Read,"His book ""Remote Control"" was good, but this is just boring.In this book, McNab frequently goes into excruciating detail on sneaking, stalking, snooping and other military type activities. But instead of being interesting, there is simply too much detail and it ends up being tedious. So much so, that I found I needed to skip parts of pages and sometimes whole pages where nothing that advanced the plot was happening.I also found the ending to be poor, but I can't elaborate without spoiling it for others who decide to labour through this unsatisfactory book."
2,A Tedious Read,"Very slow moving and it would be a better read if the pace was faster. The plot while topical is not as wide ranging as those by Frederic Forysth or Tom Clancy.Pages were devoted to how Nick Stone kept watch - some readers might appreciate the details. For me, it just took so long to move the story forward. The balance between attention to details and story telling needs to be better.In addition, the ease of smuggling a weapon into the White House on the pre-text of forgetting to bring the camera is just too incredulous."
2,Am I the only lost person??,"This is not a book it is a screen play. Made for the big or little screen complete with bad language. I have not read his prior books so this one has lost me. maybe if I had I would be able to follow this. I can't seem to 'catch his drift"" so the book has been filed to 'read when all other books have been read shelf.'There are much better thrillers out there!!!!!!"
3,Prof. Ulam was a pivotal figure,"Prof. Ulam's recent death need not deter anyone from finding this book a welcome salve to the usual academic tomes that even he sometimes produced during his many years as a father of Sovietology. His studennts and colleagues knew him as a real ""mensch"" and this book shows those who didn't get to know him how a powerful set of personal experiences, both before and during the Cold War, made it possible for Adam to create a unique body of knowledge which was truly innovative.Those who were not terrible cognizant of the sometimes stark and sometimes ambigious realities of the Cold War will find this an engaging read."
4,An enjoyable read,"I have never read any of Professor Ulam's other works (I believe the tally ended at 18, with this book, after Ulam's death). I had been told by several friends and colleagues that his were, if nothing else, a brilliant marriage of the scholarly and the approachable. The latter is more the case here, wherein Ulam provides his life story, with the tumultuous changes in Europe (both East AND West) as the backdrop.More than just a series of anecdotes strung together with a calendar, Ulam presents us with gripping and often moving tales from his past - including, most notably (to me), his departure from Poland at the age of 16, just six days before Hitler's invasion.This is a book I'll proudly display on my shelf; it's certainly not one I would have run out and bought the second it hit the shelves, but it was, like a roller-coaster ride through the rise and fall of the Soviet Union, a breathtaking journey, and one I'll revisit again and again."
5,Embracing the microcosmic as well as the world-spanning,"Written by Adam B. Ulam (1922-2000) an erudite professor emeritus of Harvard University, Understanding The Cold War: A Historian's Personal Reflections, is both an engaging, informative examination of the rise and fall of the Soviet Union, and a an intimate, candid confession of how the world-changing effects of the Cold War personally affected his family. Vividly written and tracing a personal legacy in the post World War II world, Understanding The Cold War offers the reader a different perspective on history, embracing the microcosmic as well as the world-spanning shape of events."
3,"Earthtime, Moontime, Sacred Time for us!","A facinating book about the phases of the moon and how they relate to us in our lives. The back of the book has a chart that desinates which of the thirteen moons ruled at the time of your birth. You can then read about that moon which has been assigned it's own chapter. Each moon discusses the goddess energies related to it, related energies, manifesting with those energies, the challenges of living with those energies, self-discovery journal for those born under that moon, and more. As you can tell it is very intense discussion.Using this knowledge you can use the journal exercises to explore your own connection to the earth and to the wheel of the year. Learn to live in harmony with the Mother and life cycles. Recommended for students of the Craft who want to expand their horizons and begin to incorporate their spirituality into their lives as our ancestors did so very long ago!"
2,Not all that special...,"The book sounded a great deal more complex and informative than it actually is. I was left wanting more. If you're simply looking for a soft, feel-good type book then this should be fine. If you're looking for a better understanding of how Time, Earth, Moon and humans interact...look elsewhere."
2,Wordy. Good only for spiritual healing.,"The author divides people into 13 types based on the phase of the moon such as Nesting, Milk, Seed and so on.The information is good for spiritual only. Besides that, there is no practical usage.The explanation is wordy. Each type of person is described in about 10 pages which the user can sum up in half a page."
3,IN MERCY,I found this book among items belong to my deceased father. I assume he read it. I have read it a couple of times. A very confronting story in some ways. Worth a read. In no way glorifying war. And more than racy for its time. The author was Australian
4,John Deere Tractor Tapestry Pillow,"Great response on order. I thought I was getting something more for children, but that was not the seller's fault.Seller did a great job on their obligation to the order."
5,Wow! Can Anyone Review Her Other Albums?,"I've been browsing Amazon today, putting more music on my ""Wish List."" I'm disappointed that I can't listen to all of Rosa Passos' albums here -- can anyone share his/her thoughts on the flavors of Canta Antonio Carlos Jobim, Azul or Festa? I must get Morada Do Samba! Her voice is so gentle and sweet. All of her songs on this album are well matched: mellow yet sexy. Perfect for cooking a romantic dinner or just melting into the floor by yourself in peace (thanks ArtCity, for your review )."
5,At Last!,"'Louisiana Purchase' appeared before the practice of releasing 'Original Cast' recordings came into being and so this 1996 presentation (Weill Hall, Carnegie Hall) is most welcome. The plot is not about the orginal Louisiana Purchase but a much later political world around the time of Huey P. Long. Many of the songs are very 'topical' and so are dated but they're all from the prolific pen of Irving Berlin and sung by a cast of attractive voices, which makes them well worth sampling. For all fans of Broadway show history."
1,Less Than Average,"While documentation about JumpStart is extremely limited, this book just doesn't cut it. It is a conglomeration of documents that are available from Sun for free. Only, there is more documentation from Sun available than is accumulated in this book.There is supposed to be a new edition out in a few months that's supposed to have much more information in. Save your money for this edition and download the documentation from Sun - check the next edition, maybe it'll be better."
2,"Good coverage, but missing a few...pages","Seriously, check your book. Mine is missing pages 7-30, but in an attempt to counter this flaw, I did get 2 sets of pages 1-6. Or is there someone else out there missing pages 1-6 and has 2 sets of pages 7-30.But overall, the book is good. I used some white papers from Sun's site and this book to get Jumpstart working."
1,BAD BAD BAD,"Deal hunter company should never be used, they send a package not factory wrapped missing parts and damaged,rude refuse to allow returns"
5,My Favorite Scent,"This lotion is my favorite of all the lotions I've tried (and I've tried many). I really encourage people to try this product because it is made with good quality ingredients, smells wonderful, and makes my skin feel and look really healthy!"
5,CAL MAG,Good value for the price. It doesn't fizz as much as their other flavors. Taste is good. I do add a tablespoon of blueberry or cherry concentrate in it for added health benefits.
2,"Not a great flick, but sort of fun","This movie has the feel of a television pilot (I think it was). It isn't a great movie, but if you're a fan of Stephen J. Cannell shows, it's for you. For Jim Varney fans, his role is a real treat a goofy inventor (brother to Chad Everett character) who always has a scam up his sleeve."
2,Warning: the chicken dies.,"Please be aware that the beloved pet chicken dies before you allow your young child to read this book. My daughter was taken by surprise, and she sobbed and sobbed. This is a gripping story with fascinating historical details, but she really came to love Josephina and she was not prepared for her death."
4,The Move West,"The Josefina Story Quilt, by Eleanor Coerr is a sad and happy book.Faith is a girl and she has a pet hen, named Josefina.Like lots of other families in 1850, Faith's family is going west to California. Faith wants to take her pet hen(Josefina) with them but her Pa says no. Finally her Pa lets her take Josefina along.On the way lots of sad things happen:2 old people die along with 3 oxen. Faith makes quilt squares on the way to tell what's happening.Josefina saves the day at the end.I would reccomend this easy reader to you. It has a bittersweet ending. I say this book is 4 out of 5."
3,The Josephina Story Quilt,The Josephina Story Quilt by Eleanor Coerr. It is interesting because I learned that quilts made in the 1700's helped people remember the days going west.
1,"An early, disappointing CD","24 Hours A Day and Leftovers are such perfect albums that I expected earlier records to pale in comparison. I wasn't ready, though, for how weak a CD their eponymous 1993 release is. Songs like Gas Girl, Trailer Mama, and Wave That Flag are forced at best. Both the lyrics and music sound like they were written in a rush. The melodies aren't catchy, and the attempts at cleverness come across as trite and dumb. There are some more heavy-duty country songs in here, but they don't fit with the rest of the CD. Kerosene and the heavy Rural Route are the two standouts, though I'm still not sure if the former is meant to be serious or a joke (it's about people who died in a trailer fire because they put gasoline in their kerosene heater: ""if kerosene works why not gasoline?""). A major disappointment for me."
4,Worth the extra money for me,"I am surprised that this isn't available for digital download. Must be some contractual stuff going on here.So we got to pay some extra money for this. It was worth it for me as I am a Bottle Rockets fan.For me this album is solid beginning to end. I enjoy it without hitting the skip button. 'Kerosene' is the ""double classic song"" here. Just love that song and that song will be highly downloaded when this album is 'digitalized'. 'Wave that Flag' is a classic song with a lyric from one kind of redneck to another kind of redneck.I think that there are some really interesting ideas on this album: a lyric from 'Kerosene' - ""I wonder who is the jury that decided that they are all guilty"" when referring to a tragic fire that took the life of a family. The liberal message might not agree with the ""Fox News Crowd"", but it comes across in a 'down home manner' that increases the impact."
2,Service of this company is lacking,"We ordered a few things from this company--We received one and are still waiting for the other one 6 weeks later. After 2 phone calls and 2 emails---once saying we'd like to cancel the order completely, we still have not heard back from this company. There customer service is truly in need of some work."
1,Order Canceled.,"Drive Medical Locking Elevated Toilet Seat - 1 / CaseOrder Canceled April 8, 2008. Total of $37.31 refunded to credit card, 04/08/2008."
4,Gets in depth w/o being verbose,"Ganuro Girls, basically a picture book, gets as deep as these girls are - a photo book. Not much substance here, except that this is one book packed with photos and questionnaires on these interesting Japanese girls. Some are in HS, some are in college, many answer that they will be ganguro until age 25, some are prostitutes, and how much money they had in their purses. Many recognize that this is a trend, and this is temporary identity."
1,Myrna had her peak 20 yrs ago. Not impressed.,"I loved Mryna's voice 20 yrs ago but would say that's when it peaked. When she was in Human Switchboard- who, I understand the lead singer went to jail and is now a felon- she was good, but the vine ripened long ago and now is dried and withered :("
3,A good overview but not a comprehensive guide,"This a book that will give you an overview of the main causes of stroke and what to expect as of ""The Day After"". A good source of ""initial"" information after you or a loved one had just had a stroke. This book is for a family member suffering from sleepless nights on the waiting room while the stroke patient is in the Intensive Care Unit or those who have just woke up after a stroke and still lack basic info. The information provided by the book is useful, but most of it is already available in the many stroke reference sites throughout the internet. If you already have some education about the topic, this is not the book for you."
3,Stroke Recovery,"Overall, a solid book, but could be a lot more comprehensive. It just doesnt cover all of the issues. (I was still left with questions).I recommend the book by Joel Stein, MD, called Stroke and the Family, which is very understandable, but has more information."
3,Why give up?,"While I found this book interesting it would be most disappointing if I were someone looking for real answers. If someone is looking for real recovery then I would recommend a book called Peeling the Onion:Reversing the Ravages of Stroke. In 2000 my grandmother had a stroke which left her paralyzed, unable to roll over in her bed and unable to speak. Long-short, I took a shot and took her to this clinic where, in less than a week she and I were again having two-way conversations and she could transfer herself from the car to the wheelchair. By the time we went home she was walking 400 feet with a walker. Strokes change families but they don't have to be permanently debilitating. If you are looking for help for the stroke and not just a book to read, you might want to order it. Thank God for Dr. Hammesfahr and his stroke therapy!Peeling the Onion: Reversing the Ravages of StrokePeeling the Onion: Reversing the Ravages of Stroke"
5,Our Doctor Recommended This Book,"My mother had a stroke recently. Her physician recommended this book, which we found very helpful. I would recommend it to any family who is doing through such a crisis."
5,Great product,I will buy this again it really spiced up my beef and onion maybe not recommended but it was good. I will recommend to friends.
3,Okay,"Interesting stuff. Goldman's writing has gone off the boil in the past 15 years, so I don't know that he's in a position to hand out advice anymore. He blames the failure of GHOST AND THE DARKNESS on Michael Douglas having his part revamped. But Douglas' character is a SMALL part of that film, so to blame its failure on THAT is ludicrous. I know someone who was in on the production of GHOST AND THE DARKNESS before Goldman came aboard, and had hopes it would be a great film, because the true story itself is great. And then Goldman was assigned the writing. When I asked my friend how the script was, he said, ""Goldman wrote a terrible script."" My friend was exasperated because it could have been great. And when I saw the film, I agreed with my friend. Goldman screwed it up. Douglas didn't help. It's probably his worst performace I've ever seen. But Goldman's mainly to blame."
1,Self-important rantings,"This is perhaps the most self-conscious (in the worst sense of the term), self-important and pedantic book I have read in years. Goldman has some excellent insights into the world of movie and script making, along with some choice anecdotes, but you have to muddle through an insufferable ego along the way. Definitely not worth the trip."
1,Waste of time,"What a self-serving waste of a tree. I thought I would puke when he called John Donne ""Johnny D."" I didn't even finish the book."
1,Nothing New Here,"I enjoyed Goldman's ADVENTURES IN THE SCREEN TRADE, which is why I went out and paid retail for this one. I shouldn't have. Goldman has not aged well. He doesn't have enough fun ""Hollywood Insider"" stories left to tell, he's painfully ill-equipped to teach screenwriting (You wouldn't think so, but it becomes obvious very quickly), and he's REALLY out of touch. (Is he the only writer who didn't understand the Coen Brothers' THE BIG LEBOWSKI?) In general, I'm surprised by the poor quality of this book. Goldman's prose is first-draft quality, and his observations are no longer interesting, much less incisive."
3,Entertaining but that damn TONE!,"Whilst an entertaining read once again from Mr Goldman, this clearly does not have the freshness and immediacy of the original : Adventures in the Screen Trade. I think the problem I had with this book is captured perfectly by one of the critics of his screenplay in the book ""The Big A"". He refers to a underlying problem with Goldman's `tone'. Personally, I love a subversive and original approach to a genre but doggone it, Goldman is ALL OVER THE PLACE in this book. He digresses, he gives us excepts from his tape recorded journal that should remain in his head and does the `luvvy' routine with the stars. Plus, I was also aware that his star seems to have faded. It's Butch this and Princess Bride that, because nothing else is worth bragging about (he even admits those are his favorites!).Time to tone down Mr Goldman."
2,out of touch curmudgeon,"Goldman, who hasn't written a good film in a quite a while, states that the 90's was the worst decade in film history. Which only shows that he's an out of touch curmudgeon railing against ""kids today."" Cranks like Goldman can't appreciate or acknowledge the excellence of such newcomers as Quentin Tarantino and Paul Thomas Anderson. There are many other excellent filmmakers from the independent film movement, and their cumulative work has created a genuine renaissance of film art. The 90's were as fertile as the 70's. There were a lot of bad 90's movies, to be sure, but most of them came from the major studio ""factory,"" where Goldman certainly made his contribution."
3,entertaining,"I agree with other reviewers that this book was entertaining. I enjoyed it, although i also agree with the idea that it's a bit rambling. The sample script beginning at the end of the book, critiqued by other writers, was probably the most interesting part of the book because of the insight it provides to writers' approaches. I only wish that goldman had included an email address for the reader to express opinions."
3,"Part memoir, part instruction book","This book would be invaluable for anyone thinking of trying to earn a living as a screenwriter. Opening with Goldman's recolections of his pariah status in the early 80's, it follows his return to writing books and screenplays (Maverick, Misery, Absolute Power). I did not realize that he had also written the book, on which the Princess Bride was based, and it was very revealing the process he took to produce that book. Be forwarned, he is very caustic and sarcastic at times, but it is tempered with real insight. He also includes snipets of his work...as written, and gives unlimited advice to anyone who would want to follow in his footprints. The final section is almost a master class of writing, he provides a screenplay, and comments from various well known writers. I enjoyed the memoir and the honesty."
4,Nice Follow-up,"I loved Adventures in the Screen Trade, so I bought Which Lie did I tell? While not quite as good as the first book, it was still entertaining and informative. I loved reading his section on The Princess Bride, and I was glad to read that he actually liked that movie (since he tends not to like anything he's written).Unfortunately, since I read Adventures in the screen Trade so recently (and he wrote it 20 years ago), a lot of the information--especially when he would talk about Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid--seemed like he was repeating himself. It wasn't that bad, though. It was still fun to read it a second time around.As with Adventures..., I loved the section at the end of the book where he included a screenplay and had people analyze it. It's very interesting to see what works and what doesn't in other people's eyes. It helps to give a good idea to what to include in my own screenplays.Overall, it was a wonderful book--just not as good as the first one. C'est la vie."
5,Fantastic story of life in Atlantic Canada,"Classic story of a girl with determination, guts and brains who strived to live life to the fullest. Beautiful portrayal of a simple life in Prince Edward Island"
5,Great Version for Young Children!,"This is a basic/shortened version that is great for introducing your young child to this wonderful story! My 3-1/2 year old now loves the story as much as I love it! When she's older, I'll introduce her to the fuller, more detailed original story."
5,Much better than I expected!,"At first I'd thought this book was another of those fancy-schmancy, dragging novels, but I found myself thoroughly enjoying reading about Anne Shirley of Green Gables. It is about how a young orphan girl finds a home at Green Gables in Avonlea, Prince Edward Island. Each chapter is like a short story. They are funny when Anne is younger, like the episode when she dyed her hair green :), but as she grows older they start to deal more with her education, and, near the end of the book, depressing subjects like death and of the possible loss of Anne losing her beloved home, Green Gables. The characters are written about in a way that you can easily become familiar with them. I highly recommend this book."
5,A Book You Will Remember All Of Your Life,"I am a male and over fifty years old. I was introduced to Anne by the excellent Canadian film production ""Anne of Green Gables"" and shortly thereafter began reading L M Montgomery's books. Mark Twain,along with thousands of other readers, was struck by Anne and her story. In my lifetime I've read thousands of books-- Anne of Green Gables is one of the very best. It is perceptive, endearing, humourous, heartbreaking, and real. It's being recommended for children 9 - 12 is ridiculous, most readers of any age will love and treasure this book."
4,Perfect Anne,In this book you really see Anne change. It is an excellent book that is well worth the tome it takes to read it. My favorite parts are when she gets the pretty dress and when she recites at the concert. This is a wonderful book that you should read.
3,Okay...well not really,"This book was really geared for Girls rather than Boys, I sort of liked the book because it was exciting and L.M.Montgomery really paints a picture with her words, but the book it's self isn't very good.It's about a girl who is sent from an orphanage but the family that was to adopt a boy to help on the farm. Will she stay or will she go?"
3,It's okay...at first,Anne of Green Gables is a really great book that I had to read for school. I liked alot except the longness of the book. It got kind of boring and I don't like how the story isn't tied off in the first book. I think it would be better to find something else or watch the movie because the book is pretty long and it CAN ( I'm not saying it will) get a little boring at times.
3,Okay.... I guess,This book is okay if you like L-O-N-G fancy words and no real adventures (mysteries) Anne just comes and ofcourse she stays at Green Gables. Then she just has little things like- Oops I dropped the butternife or there's a mouse in the pudding!.It's kind of boring. THe only fun parts are when Anne has funny ideas and all the scenes with Anne and Gilbert are okay. Dianna is a weakling and can never tand up for herself. I'd like this book more if LOTS more happened. The plot is okay but the writing is kind of dull with all the BIG lllooonnnggg words. I hope you like it more than I do but if you want my advice... watch the movie or even the trailer instead of reading the book. It's alot better ( And alot faster!):)
2,DDDDDDRRRRRRYYYYYY& *anoying*!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Anne of Green Gables was boring. It used many hard words. The plot was okay. The Author could've made it better and more interesting. The Author should've described the characters more. The characters should've had less alike attitudes. They didn't really talk about their feelings. Ididn't really enjoy the book. If you like long, dry, and very undiscriptive books this is the book for you."
2,I'm over it.,"We all know it is a great book and a classic by a good author,and I loved it growing up(in fact i even read the entire series..dont ask me how i did that)but now?..Well,now it has grown tired,I am through with it,over it,although-strangely yes-I will keep my copy."
5,"One of my all time favorites! If you haven't read it, do!","Young Anne Shirly has been an orphan nearly all her life, and when Mathew Cuthbert comes to take her back to his house at Green Gables, Anne emediatly falls in love with it. Marilla almost refuses to keep her, but finally agrees to. On her first day at school a boy named Gilbert calls her Carrots, the name she despises most. Gilbert tries to appologise but Anne has made up her mind never to forgive him. Anne and her ""bossum"" friend Diana get into all kinds of mischife and adventures. If you haven't read this book, do!"
4,Anne of Green Gables,"Anne of Green Gables is about a mischivous and imaginative girl named Anne who was adopted by the old Cuthberts in Canada. It is set in the 1800's at the land called Green Gables. This exciting story is about all the perils Anne has to go through while growing up. She thinks she is ugly and because of that she thinks she will be lonely, but she gains the freindship of a girl named Diana. Anne may end up living almost the life she's always dreamed of. If you enjoy reality books with a bit of fun then I reccomend this excellent book."
3,Pretty Good,This book was very detailed and you could easily become involved but the problem is that there isn't much that happens in this story. The events in this story are very few and the ones that you expect to become suspenseful are just another daily errand in everyone else's lives.
5,All time favourite,"Once in a life time you find someone or something that takes after your own heart ,something that comes in the ""Soul mate"" category.Well that's what Anne of Green Gables is to me ,A soul mate.I have read it more than 50 times and that is not an exaggeration only the truth.And I continue to read it every time ""My soul gets starved for a kindred spirit"".Anne Shirley,Gilbert Blythe,Diana Barry,Priscilla Grant,Stella Maynard,Philippa Gordan,Mrs.Rachel Lynde,Miss Cornelia and of course Rebecca Dew, are all real to me.Oh I forgot to mention Susan.She too.They are all a part of my life. I tried to erase the review which gave it a 6 rating.I give it a 100!!I choose my friends on the basis of if they do or don't LOVE Anne and her successors.I can go to war with anyone who dares to criticise.I met my best friend and soul mate thru Anne.I first read it 6 yrs ago when I was 12"
5,Perfectly Wonderful Novel.,"Anne of Green Gables is a wonderful tale in which any romantic, dreamer or reader should read. Anne is a delightful character which the reader can identify and relate with. Personally, I love the whole series, from this particular novel to the last, about Anne's daughter, Rilla(of Ingleside). These novels give any reader plenty of smiles, and even tears, while reading.Wether your looking for romance or a story about young girl, I strongly recommend this series of books to anyone ready for a delightful set of stories about a girl who blossoms into a woman."
2,Where are all the books,"I bought this complete collection expecting to get all the books in the set, only got the first book in the set. Highly disappointed."
4,Imaginative Anne,"Anne of Green Gables is a book written by L.M. Montgomery. It is about Anne, an imaginative, fiery-tempered orphan girl, who is accidentally adopted. Anne lives on Prince Edward Island with her strict new mother and understanding father.When her fiery-temper gets the best of her, her parents almost send her back to the orphanage. She begs them to give her one more chance and they agree.Later in the book a tragedy happens and Anne has to learn to grow up.I like the book Anne of Green Gables because I like Anne's vivid imagination. I mostly like how she always manages to get out of the horrific trouble she always gets herself into. I recommend the book to boys and girls from the ages of twelve to eighteen."
5,Delightful Children's Story,"Anne is a skinny, carrot haired, orphan with an extremely bad temper. Her wonderful imagination gets her in and out of trouble. When she finds she may finally have a home at Green Gables her soul is lifted. Though it soon falls, because the Cuthberts didn't want a girl! Anne spends the whole story trying to prove to the Cuthberts that she can call herself Anne of Green Gables."
4,Anne of Green Gables,"This book is about a young orphan girl with a huge imagination. She has a hard life at first. She has to go to many dffrent orphanages, also she has to watch younger kids when she is a child herself! She also has many other problems becouse she daydreams a lot. She always gets in trouble for it too.One day her dreams come true. She is brought to a beautiful house that is Green Gables. Many times she gets into trouble, always on accident.This story takes place long ago in Canada. So if you like books from long ago, you should read this book.I like this book becouse it is sad and exciting at the same time."
1,THIS IS NOT ANNE OF GREEN GABLES!,"Look on the cover. It says ""Adapted by"". This is not Lucy Maud Montgomery's book, and it is not even well-written. The story has been ripped off and re-written for younger readers.Anne of Green Gables is a children's classic, and would be enjoyed by girls with a reading level of 5th grade and above. Girls aged 5 - 12 would love the stories. It is best to wait until you can read the actual version, though, for the value of the literature and the humor in the author's brilliant pen. Purchase an unabridged edition instead of this adapted version."
3,enjoy a classic,"If your looking for a classic book in small children language, this is the book. I felt that this book did a well job in introducing Anne Shirley to my young daughter. The book is tended for 1st through 3rd grade students. It is well written. If you loved reading about Anne Shirley while you were growing up, and wish to have your daughters find out about this wonderful girl, then this book is for you."
2,Did they even hire an proofreader?,"I spent more on this edition due to the fact that it was an anniversary edition, which had endorsement from the Author's family & such. I thought it would be the best choice to add to my home library. Then I read it!This book has soooo many misspelled words! How many times can they call Maria ""Mania""? Instead of the word ""over"" the word ""oven"" is used! I cant even let my children read it for fear they will get confused!I don't know how it is possible that someone got paid for proofreading this book - and I can only wonder if the author's family is aware of how pathetic this version is, that they have endorsed!"
3,Wonderful story,I have always loved the Anne of Green Gables series but if I were you I would buy one of the unillustrated versions. Fernandez did not do justice to the story with her illustrations. Anne of Green Gables is a timeless story even though it is set in a very specific era--a must read for all.
2,Where is your proofreader?,"I was charmed to see the original illustrations that I remembered from my Grandmother's copy. But the book is marred by proofreading failures. Marilla is Manila at one point, and something else at another point; chair becomes chain, and a star is clean instead of clear. L.M. Montgomery would not be pleased! It's still a great book, but I feel that the publisher dishonored it. It's a pity."
5,Anne of Green Gables is a timeless story and inspring book,I am 20 years old and first read the Anne of Green Gables series when I was 12. I recently watched the movies and plan on re-reading the series. Montgomeries stories of this orpaned girl are imganitive and heart warming. Anne has inspired my life. Her never ending look for adventure and love in life has been a true insiration to me.
5,Anne of Green Gables,"This is the first book in the Anne of Green Gables series. The first time i read this book was in 6th grade, i've read it many times since then(i own it). And each time I read it, the more i like it. Before I read this book, i didn't think i would like it because it's a classic. But, one of my friends convinced me to read it. And it became one of my favorite books and still is. In this book, eleven year old Anne, who is an orphan, comes to live with a brother and sister who own a farm. The problem? They wanted a boy to help out on their farm. But, Anne wins them over with her sparkling personality. Even if she does seem to be a maganet for trouble. This is one of those books that you want to go on forever. Good thing, there's plenty of sequals. An excellent book."
5,Too good to be true!!!!,"I have watched Anne of Green Gables so many times. I came in touch with Anne quite late in my life. I do repent for that. Such a positive personality, with such a beautiful attitude towards life, is so much needed as daily inspiration. I came to know about this radio programme from Amazon. Seeing such good reviews I purchased it. Thanks to all the reviewers. They are so correct. I listen to this radio drama production to and fro from work and never get bored. Moreover, this makes me feel good, love life and be a better self everyday. I highly recommend this radio drama production to all ""kindred spirits""."
5,Anne of Green Gables music CD,The CD was wonderful and I had such a hard time finding it. I was so glad to get it. I saw the play Anne of Green Gables many years ago in Prince Edward Island and this CD brought back some wonderful memories. The CD was in excellent condition and I received it very quickly. Thanks!
2,Have a pencil handy when reading the 100th anniversary edition,"I bought the ""special, 100th anniversary"" edition of this book I had never read (though I thoroughly enjoy the television adaptation starring Megan Fallows). Montgomery's writing is wonderful. Unfortunately, this edition is marred by many typographical errors. Most that I have encountered so far (I have only read about a fourth of the book as of this morning) seem to substitute ""n"" for ""r"" -- producing ""on"" when ""or"" is intended, ""oven"" for ""over,"" etc. By far the most jarring is seeing Marilla rendered ""Mania"" -- including twice within two pages. It's a shame that the publishers can't do better when putting out what purports to be a ""special"" edition of this classic."
3,"Lovely, but abridged","Who, if not Megan Follows, could read Anne of Green Gables? This is a wonderful collection, but not, as labled, unabridged. After listening to the tapes, we cross-checked with the books, and noticed significant gaps, many missing chapters. If you want the complete books, try another collection. That's what we have to do."
4,Great reading -,or re-reading - - haven't read this since I was a young teenager - much to enjoy with the antics of Anne
3,Heidi's review,"This story,Anne of Green Gables,is an awesome novel.L.M. Montgomery takes you on an adventure to Green Gables,a wonderous place filled with many trees,streams,etc.{When Montgomery uses such vivid adjectives she makes the setting come alive,like you could actually go to Green Gables} When Anne is on her way to Green Gables she imagines what this new place is going to be like.This is the part pf the story where Montgomery's talent shines.When Anne describes a tree with white blossoms she say,""a bride in all white with a lovely misty veil.""Montgomery's use of vivid adjectives makes the book seem real.Another use of her adjectives makes the book awesome"
3,I liked the book because it was heart-warming.,"Anne comes from a bad family and then she moves in with a good family. Anne learns to love and appreciate her new family. I learned that it is hard to be adopted into a family that really does not want you. I liked this book, but it was boring. I liked this book because it was a heart-warming book."
5,I'TS AN ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS READ!!!! I'TS BEAUTIFUL!!!,"i love it love it love it.i really really do!i'ts best read when you're a young teenaged girl. i'm twenty now and i started reading(and collecting)the ANNE OF GREEN GABLES series when i was around fourteen or fifteen and i still re-read them even now. i'ts the kind of book that really influences a young girl to be`just like Anne'. I know i have been. LUCY MAUD MONTGOMERY was a great authoress,i must say. I wish i had more of her books. One day i hope to visit Prince Edward Island,Canada. I mean to do some `ANNE' book-scavenging,dreaming and exploring."
4,A moving story about an orphan who gave of herself to others,"I thought it was a great book because I loved the pictures,plus the girl in the book was very kind and gentle.It had a biography about her life,from when she was 12 to 18.I really liked that it had pictures on every page.Her father Matthew died which was sad, but the ending was happy."
5,This book really changed my life.,"I actually did not buy this book here at amazon.com , but I checked it out of my library. I was looking for a book randomly, and the fish on the cover caught my eye, so i picked it up, and checked it out. Oh my god. This book has changed my life forever. The book made me think so much about the world around me, and to really question life itself. How ignorant we are to walk around in our little lives, completely ignoring the greatness of everything around us, like how the sky stays up there, and how we stay planted on the ground, and how rain falls. After crying a little, and laughing a little, I finished the book with great satisfaction, and whole new persepective on life. If everyone in the world read this book, the world would be a grander place, in which we don't worry about petty differences, but instead wonder. Five stars, and nothing less."
5,Look at life in a whole new fashion,"The Solitaire Mystery, while written in the vein of fantastical young adult literature, transcends any particular genre or age group. Gaarder incorporates his philosophy expertise into this ingeniously crafted tale that sparks the imagination and galvanizes the spirit. As we follow a truly singular dichotomy of tales -- one in the real world and one in a magical world of Rainbow Soda and a living and breathing deck of cards.One cannot truly do justice to this incredible tome in an abbreviated book review other than by simply exhorting others to read it and discover the magic for oneself. Valuable life lessons and refreshing new outlooks on life are yours for the asking...errr, I mean reading.""The only thing I know is that I know nothing.""- Socrates (as quoted by Gaarder)"
2,Boring,"Let me start off by saying I really enjoyed Sophie's World, but this book just seem to ramble on without any getting to any kind of point. I finally got bored with it and couldn't finish it."
2,Pretentious drivel,"I feel that I must be an ignorant philostine. The book did nothing for me at all. A young boy and his dad are searching for their mother/wife who herself has gone off to find herself. The boy stumbles across a tiny book that speaks of a deck of cards a la Alice in Wonderland, a lost island, and this annoying rainbow fizz. Travclling together Hans, the 12 year old boy, thinks about the secret book but cannot tell his father about it. 75% through the book you have figured out how it is going to end. The philosphical side of the book does not make you want to ooh and ahh, unless you are the type of person that likes to ""titter"" during movies that are not particularly funny - or you do it because you are trying to impress a girl/boy as to how intellectual you are.Now don't get me wrong, I am not the type of person that roars with laughter at the Three Stooges or Abbott & Costello. Its just that this book was laborious to read."
5,You will feel like you are in this story!,This is a great book of Jostein. I couldn't take my eyes of it and have to finish it within a day. The plot is great and so creative. You can get a lot of ideas to think about throughout this exciting story. And you can also be 'Hans Thomas'!
4,A good and delightful read.,"This is the first time I'm reading a book by Mr Gaarder and I've certainly not been disappointed. It's a very thoughtful book full of ideas of life, expressed through the characters in the sticky-bun book, such as the joker and Frodo. It's a very thought-provoking read, but light-hearted in a sense. Really set me thinking"
4,A journey of distance and time,"""The Solitaire Mystery"" is a wonderful tale of Hans Thomas and his journey through distance and ""time"" through the sticky-bun book . Jostein Gaarder used characters such as dwarfs and moluks, but the story and the truths and lessons , will really make you think about life---regardless of the whimsical characters. This is truly a great book to cherish. I wouldn't mind reading it again"
5,The best book I have EVER read,"This is the best book ever written. The Solitaire Mystery gives a whole new meaning to life. Deftly linking life and fantasy - merging the two so much that it's hard to make out which is which. Suddenly ""life"" becomes even more mysterious than we think it is. An absolute must-read for anyone who has ever wondered ""who am I"" and ""where do we come from"". Watch out - this could shake you up...They may have said that about every other book - but this is one book that is completely UN-PUT-DOWN-ABLE. I finished it in a day and haven't stopped reading it again and again since I first read it 3 years ago."
3,A mixed opinion...,"I read this book after reading Sophie's World. I don't have any conscious memory of specific expectations when I began reading this book, but the unintentional comparison was there. Sophie's World was thought-provoking, a work of genius.The Solitaire Mystery is worth reading, there's no doubt of that. The complicated and interwoven plots were quite interesting to untangle. However, the story just didn't draw me in the way Sophie's World did. It was just a story."
5,"Wonderful, Brilliant, Beautiful","I absolutely love this book and have read it numerous times!I read Sophie's World by the same author and really liked it so I decided to try this one and bought it at my local bookstore (I was 15 at the time) and I loved it then I still love it now (I'm 18) and would reccomend it to people of any age. Kids will love it for it's fantastical story and adults for the story but also the insight, poetry, and philsophy. It's an amazing tale of fate and fantasy and the details just lock together so cohesively to form the complex story.It's a must read!"
5,An artful mixture of life and philosophy,"Not only does Gaarder tell a great story with interesting changes in perspective, but he mixes in really thought provoking philosopy. You don't have to know much about philopshy or philosophers to ""get it"". He makes his leap into the philosophical very accessible. This book lingers in you mind. I loved it!"
5,it's just a really good book,"i read sophie's world last summer, and we all have to admit there were times i was falling asleep. but the solitaire mystery is a wonderful book filled adventure and silliness that brings about philosophical issues in a fun, light way. i recomend this book to anyone interested in philosophy. simple and childish as it may be, it's pretty darn good!"
2,Should've stopped at 3,"The first book was one of the best sci fi novels I've ever read, the next two were also very enjoyable, but I have to say, this one almost reads either like someone else wrote it using Pohl's notes, or Pohl himself wrote it but only under extreme duress. Characters I had grown to love were reduced in this story to one-dimensional thumbnails. Earlier in the series, I had truly felt Robin's pain, his guilt, and later, I felt a certain satisfaction in watching him struggle through the whole thing and grow as a character, achieving success, and maybe more importantly peace of mind. In this story he was completely annoying and so was his wife. Gaahh! What a shame this was the closer! If you enjoyed the first three books in the story, do what I wish I had done - walk away from this one and forget you ever saw it."
3,"Ties up a few loose ends, but pretty mediocre overall","I really enjoyed the first two books in this series. They were some great science fiction. The third one wasn't bad either. This novel, on the other hand, was a bit tedious at times. In one part, Albert spent several pages explaining the Big Bang theory. In another part, the main characters were just killing time on a trip across the galaxy, and nothing of consequence really happened. These are just two examples. ""The Annals of the Heechee"" does neatly tie up many of the loose ends from the previous novels in the series, but the story doesn't really stand very well on its own."
4,Quality Cufflinks,"The cuff links I ordered were more than I expected. Very polished and styled, it will show the wearer his has the finesse of displaying his sport and status."
3,Good but pricey,"I purchased this video through amazon because I had received an amazon gift card. I really like the Nest Entertainment videos and own several of them. This one is all right. They took a few liberties with the story and left out others things I thought were important, but nothing harmless. My biggest complaint is what you get for the price. For the same price you can purchase this video at the nest family website but it comes with a resource book and their resource books are very good. I contacted amazon and I was told they don't sell the book with the video. If it weren't for the fact that I was using a gift card, I wouldn't have bought this video through amazon."
1,DVD Karioke- Country Hits-V.8,"I am looking for older country western songs, Ray Price, Ernest Tubb, Willie Nelson,Bob Wells, on Karioke"
1,bite me.,"Eh. You know how some books can make me bitter? This is one of them. I thought this was going to be one of the more realistic books about college life, but damn. Sorry, but I refuse to believe that a party-girl like Kim can Suddenly Realize what she should and should not do. And for her to care that much about the father she has never known? Hah. I HIGHLY doubt it. It's really annoying when writers keep trying to make a drama out of every little event. I guess this book (this series?) is targeted for middle school kids who for some reason adore reading about college.Sue me."
1,Cheap ploy to reintroduce current pop music into jazz idiom,"As with most of Belden's music, his formula has been to pick up on real artists' innovations, Sting, Prince and rework the music into varying sizes of big band ensembles. True, most of the jazz up through the 50's was based on preexisting songs, that is indisputable. But those songs lived on their own without lyrics, so instrumentalists could play them and make them live. Most of the musical part of pop music today, let's face it, is a life support system for the lyrics. Without them, the music is one-dimensional and uninteresting. Belden has skill, to be sure, but his well-worn formula of parading out current stars' music so that he can try to popularize himself is just another example of me-ism of the 60's and 70's culture."
3,Websurveyor not working,"I used this book over five semesters for the class of Marketing Research I teach at ASU. It is an OK-to-good book. However I would like to warn potential buyers that WebSurveyor has discontinued its contract with the book's publisher many semesters ago; so even if you find a coupon inside the book with a code to enter to use WebSurveyor online, you will not be able to log in..."
4,Enjoyed,"I'll be honest here...I logged into my Amazon account to review another product and this product also showed up as something needing my review...So...since I cannot remember when I ordered this, and I cannot honestly say that I remember the content, I'll give it a good healthy 4 star rating...because I can say that I (oddly) do seem to remember when I do dislike a book, and I do not remember disliking this one. So 4 star rating it is. Good luck!"
1,A Nightmare,"I saw the Kenton band over half-a-dozen times from the mid-seventies till the mid-eighties, and never heard them sound half this bad. If it were just the abysmal sound quality, I would persist; however, the ensemble work is out-of-tune and sloppy, the solos uninspired, the rhythm section like someone building a garage.My guess is that someone hired a few 'ringers' for this show who simply didn't know the book. That, or half the band was soused, which I doubt Kenton would've allowed.I profoundly agree with the above reviewer: save your money. If you want something approximating what Kenton actually sounded like, buy the ""Stan Kenton Today"" live CD, which is a reissue of the double-album vinyl ""Live in London"" first released in 1972: it coos and screams."
3,Too bad it wasn't professionally recorded,"In May of 1977 Stan Kenton fell and experienced a serious concussion. He was never the same afterwards. Whether it was restlessness or financial need that drove hin back on the road, he was anxious to return. Having seen a number of appearances from 1975 through 1978 I can attest to the fact that this is an authentic version of the post-injury Stan. A world of difference from some of the more lively shows before his accident.Stan is a shell of his former self, without animation and seemingly without enthusiasm. And yet, that said, the band was determined to see the ""old man"" off to a good finish, and they play well here. Although it's been almost thirty years, I still have great memories of seeing the Stan Kenton Orchestra. Even on a bad night they were the best ticket in town."
3,Pure Nostalgia,"Despite the two guys who critized this DVD I got it anyway and am glad I did. I got better results in 1978 with my Beta cam-corder. It is grainy and the sound isn't up to par. I played it through my Bose unit and it improved the sound. Just seeing Kenton, a year and a half before he died in August 1979, playing the piano in his unique style and trying to recreate the sound that made him famous, is well worth the ten bucks.I saw Kenton at the Capitol and Paramount theaters in New York City. Shorty Rogers, Chico Alvarez, Howard Rumsey, Art Pepper, Boots Mussulli, Kai Winding and the great singers Anita O'Day and June Christy were just part of the band in those days. Vido Musso, Pete Rugolo and Bob Cooper were his arrangers and some arrangeements are a part of this DVD. Sit back,listen and remember the days when the stage rose from the belly of the Paramount theatre and you heard Artistry In Rhythm. Those were the days!"
2,Last Concert,"I have been a Kenton fan for almost 50 years. I had seen him perform live at least a dozen times. It was good to see a concert again. But, this was the worst collection of soloists ever. These guys sound like a high school band. They destroyed some great arrangements."
1,Stan Kenton's Lost Concert,"I was extremely disappointed in the quality of this tape, sound was awful, picture quality amateurish at best, no color correction was made and the MC was far less than professional.I was hoping to have a gathering with some friends who are Kenton fans, but wouldn't subject them to such a poor presentation. I don't know why the other artists names were on the bill, Rugolo, Goodman etc....they didn't appear, nor was any mention made of them."
4,Kenton's Last Concert a must have for fans,Although the sund quality and some of the video re not the best I would recommend this DVD to all Kenton fan and ll progressive jaz fans. It is a slice of jazz and musical history. Stan died 27 years ago but his music lives on.
5,A milestone in prog-rock,"Whilst not everyone's cup of tea, Unrest represents a major milestone in prog-rock/avant-rock/rock-in-opposition. It provides a remarkable synthesis of intricate construction with free improvisation, combining elements of musique concrete with Zappa, Spontaneous Music Ensemble, the Canterbury School (Soft Machine et. al.) and contemporary classical. For my money, the track ""Ruins"" is one of the finest examples of left-field modern music, and side one of this album can still bring a lump to my throat. For those who want rock music to be only toe-tapping predictability, avoid this album like the plague.If you want your prog rock less improvised, definitely go for Henry Cow's other albums (excepting ""Concerts"")."
5,One of the Most Likeable 'Difficult' Albums I Own,"This is another one of many albums I wasn't ready for in the first hearing. It is 'difficult', perhaps some will say too intellectual. It sounded like nonsensical, indulgent noise at first, but one night I put it on in a perverse mood and just let it play while I went about my business. I ended up letting it play again and again for about a week. It sort of opens up with repeat listenings and now I find it quite beautiful."
1,Not powerful enough,"I have bought this product and was very unhappy to find that it is not powerful enough to start my Xbox. As soon as the hard drive starts to spin up, it shuts the power down. When I try a more power hungry hard drive, it does not even spin up; the green LED stays lit less than a second after I turn the Xbox on.I do not recommend this product."
1,Did not work! Do not buy this product!,"I purchased this product and installed it, as soon as I plugged it in, the fan started spinning for about 2 seconds, then stopped. After that, there was no indication of power to the unit. This power supply is a cheap knock-off made in China...avoid this and this seller like the plague!! I will let you all know if I get a refund. If not, I am never shopping on Amazon again."
5,My Pirate name is One Boot Willy.,"I hope this is just the first in a long line of work from Tom Lichtenheld. I haven't had this much fun searching the corners of the page since Tomi Ungerer's, BEAST OF MONSIEUR RACINE. Wit, charm, wisdom and humor exude from every nook and cranny. Every page has discoveries to share; which, in my opinion, is the hall mark of great children's literature. I collect children's books. I like them because they stimulate playful thinking. Few do it at a level that evokes the lighthearted joy of feeling like a kid again. This one does. EVERYTHING I KNOW ABOUT PIRATES is a peek into one of the freshest, most playful new brains in children's literature. I rate it five skull and crossbones and a yo ho ho."
5,"great read, even for adults","The older I get the more I enjoy childrens books, and I really enjoy them when they're intelligent, witty, charming, well illustrated and ""Everything...Pirates"" is all the above and more. From the intricately drawn end covers to the tiny comments hidden around the pages, this is a tour inside a child's mind of all those questions that needed answers about pirates. Highly recommended!"
2,A hard book to read,"I am a mother of two boys,ages 3 and 4. My boys adore Pirates. Both my boys like this book and it has fun pictures. I found this book to be very difficult to read,not very funny( for my kids or myself)and I dread it when my boys pick this book to read. My husband will often times read the book so that I do not have to because he knows how much I dislike this book. There are better Pirate books out there."
2,Boring,"EVERY SONG sounds exactly the same! Good idea, but musicaly this doesn't cut it. ""Kick a Picnic"" is the real stand out track, everything else is the same ""jungle sound"" follow."
5,"Great, Must have for physics majors",I studied physics 35 years ago and I wished I had this book back then. This is a great introduction to the ideas of a unified field theory. Current physics majors or anyone who wants an introduction to this subject will enjoy this book. Dr. Smolin explains concepts in quantum mechanics and relativity that have puzzled me for years.
1,Poorly Written,"This book addresses some extremely interesting topics, including string theory, quantum loop gravity, and halographic models of the universe. Unfortunately, it does not do so successfully. The author merely glosses over these topics and many deep subtopics as the disorganization of them and muddled writing ruin what otherwise might have been an interesting exercise in the comparison and contrast of approaches to developing a model of quantum gravity. The writing is so poor that I often gave up reading this book in frustration, only to return to it due to the interest in the subject matter, however ill-rendered. I recommend seeking a better treatment or treatments of the subject matter."
4,A must read for science lovers,"This book is divided into three sections,namely 1) Points of departure:deals with new conceptions like a)there is nothing outside the universe,b)in the future we will learn more,c)many observers,not many worlds and d)the universe is made of processes,not things.Next section is 2)What we have learned: deals with black holes,hidden regions,accelations and heat,""knots,links and kinks""(appears quite taugh for me)and strings. but still these two sections are mind blowing. The last sectionis is 3)The present frontiers: divided into a)the holographic universe,B)how to weave a string and c)what chooses the laws of nature? This section ends by summing up future possibilities for a complete QG theory with a hope to be achieved by 2010-2015.I also refer to the readers of this book to read Lee Smolin's highly readable article ""Atoms of Space and Time""(Scientific American,January 2004).It will serve as a good starting point ."
2,Learn almost nothing,"I have a pretty good background in math and physics. But I learned almost nothing here. I think someone with less background would learn even less. The problem is he never really defines anything, never makes clear whether he means a 'loop' is a real thing or just a calculation tool, etc.It is all just so mushy.Plus he talks a lot about theories that have no experimental tests, and none presently envisioned. This seems like metaphysics to me.You want a real popular science book that explains real science to a layman? Read QED by Feynman. Read Relativity Visualized by Epstein."
4,It's nice,"The cufflinks are nice, yet the way that they are very well finished. A good value for money."
1,An incredible disappointment,"This is for die-hard fans only, especially if you speak Hebrew. Otherwise, this CD is a cultural footnote and nothing you could actually enjoy listening to. Be warned -- this is nothing whatsoever like Kingsley's other work. The synth music is minimal and incidental, and the focus is on Jewish prayers/songs/something-or-other, all performed by a man who can't sing (or at any rate, whose voice is not compelling).I went from the high of finding this CD to the low of thinking, ""What on earth is this and why did I just waste money on it?"" within the first 20 seconds of track 1. Tracks 2, 3, 4, and 12 didn't change my opinion -- it's all the same barely listenable nonsense.You have been warned..."
1,God is a Moog no,Synthesizer music should focus on a synthesizer. I don't expect singing. I don't expect singing in German and Hebrew. I don't expect talking. Only one track had pure music -- no vocal. What a disappointment!
4,"Very waterproof and solid, but band fell apart","This watch is very solid, very scratch proof crystal, and stayed dry during snorkeling in Kauai. The only problem I have had is that the band fell apart in Lowe's while I was loading my cart, and I have no idea where a couple of the segments are. It seems as though the pins that shove into the band segments may have a slightly smaller diameter that necessary (i.e. not enough friction). The watch keeps great time."
5,Great CD,"I was very pleased with the delivery of this cd and with the quality. My daughter had this cd when she was about 8, and would play it nonstop. Somehow or other, she lost the tape. Now she is 28 and was very surprised to receive this cd for her birthday.She was excited and played it right away. The songs are great, and the acapella is great. The cd arrived in excellent condition, and she has not had a problem with it. I still enjoy it also..."
3,Most of these are easy to find,"While there is a wealth of great 70's songs on this set, only Chris Rea's ""Fool (If You Think It's Over)"" is really a difficult find, and even that one can be had with moderate effort. For a better sampler of hard to find hits, try ""Lost Hits Of The 70's"" on EMI-Capitol Music or the Barry Scott ""Lost 45's"" series (although Vol. 1 of that series is hard to find itself, and doesn't come cheap used).Nevertheless, there are a lot of good memories here, so it's a decent value. Just don't kid yourself into thinking you're getting rare songs on this CD, because most of these songs are all over the place."
5,EXCELLENT!! PURE 70's!!,"If you expect to find the original and single version of ""Fool If You Think It's Over"" on this CD, heard on the radio in the late 70's, this is the appropriate CD. All songs are very good and come in their original versions!Spanish Language/ Si tu esperas encontrar la versión original de la canción ""Fool If You Think It's Over"" escuchada en las radioemisoras de fines de los 70's, este es el cd apropiado. Todas las canciones son muy buenas! y vienen en sus versiones originales!!"
3,Hard to Find Not Just a Title,"This CD is good, and when they say hard to find, there were some selections I had not heard in a long time, and some I did not ven remember. Overall, an acquired taste, but not bad."
3,An even harder to find 45 of the 70s,"A good collection but some of them arent all that hard to find. I am impressed that they included ""After the Goldrush"" by Prelude. I had forgotten all about that one. I hope they do a second collection of these hard to find 45s of the 70s and include ""Once you understand"" by Think. You cannot find this song on a CD and are hard pressed to find it on a 45."
4,Real Music,"These songs are refreshing to listen to because they are not remastered with the high tech, bumped up, synthesized overkill decibel/ frequency levels of newer CDs. It's just the same, normal music we listened to in the '70s. The songs are in their original format. You can actually hear xylophones in Chris Rhea's ""Fooled if You Think it's Over."" There were some songs I'd never heard of, but the ones I recognized were worth the price."
3,Not the best so far,"The plotlines weren't too strong, but there was the usual humor. I haven't seen beyond episode 7, but I thought 1-4 was better."
4,Gotta Luv Fushigi Yuugi,"This is a pretty good volume, but not the best one in the series. I did like it, but i found the one part, where Miaka is practically dead, and Hotohori and Tamahome are like, ""hey, if she needs blood, i think i'll cut myself up and bleed all over her to see if it will help"" ..that part really bugged me. (there's a thing called ""blood type"", and bleeding on someone and staining their blouse isnt going to help them any)But other than that, and the ugly-mutant-miaka part, its all good! arigato 4 reading!"
1,there are better books for .net,not worth it if it is not required by your course work in school. I had to buy this as it was required textbook in the course I took.
1,Waste of time and money,"This is the worst book that I bought in my life. I knew that it is bad but I was imposed to buy for my class in the University.Beside it is expensive $75.00!!!!!!!!!!!!!, it is worst than any book that worth $10.00!!!!!!!!!Same sentences are repeated many time and the book is easly tears after a while.I would to throw the book after finishing the course, rather than keeping it.It is a nightmare!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,YOu lost a good customer,"I mistakenly order the wrong book and after 2 hours I wasn't allowed to cancel my order. Over the past 5 years I have spent well in excess of $1000 at amazon but will never buy another item from you because of this cheap, unreasonable way you had to squeeze a few extra dollars out of me."
5,"If you love singers who swing, you'll love Giacomo Gates","This is a fun CD! Gates has surrounded himself with a hot, swinging rhythm section and he has a ball working through bebop and songbook standards in the vocalese tradition of Eddie Jefferson. He's a lot more fun than Andy Bey or Kevin Mahogany, and more authentic than Kurt Elling. Spread the word, I am!"
4,jazz standards made fresh,"Giacomo Gates, employing Mark Murphy vocal techniques, has made a great album..... some original vocalese, some straight jazz singing, and a fresh vocal approach to the great jazz standards. A vocal artist. Highly recommended. Tom Jenz"
2,Mutilated Version Of A Classic Album,"The now-missing bonus tracks on the original CD issue of this album are as good as the album itself. That is, stunning. Gorgeous. Why they chose to remove them for this release, I can't fathom. I don't care how much they tweaked the sound or whatever, without the bonus tracks, you're only getting two-thirds of the story. 'Terrain' alone makes tracking the original down woth the effort.Find an older copy, the one with the dancers on the cover. You won't be sorry."
5,GRAVITY,"Fred Frith's ""Gravity"" oozes with gallantly charged racket. Fundamentally flirtatious and mysterious, this album creates a raw and basic sound which, in my opinion (obviously), radiates with stimulous emotional reaction.It's calming and relaxing yet angry and disturbing and therefore sets another mode of communication as well as meditation.I highly recommend Frith's ""Gravity"" album. I think it is pure and genuine and I absolutely love it!"
4,Great Intro,"This album works as an introduction to two great bands. On side one (LP version) Fred is backed by the Swedish band Samla Mammas Manna, and on side two by the Maryland band The Muffins. The CD version contains a few other bonus tracks which do not follow this formula.Some of the tracks work better than others, but Fred's such a musical chameleon that ""Gravity"" is really more about his backup bands than the artist with his name on the cover.This set has aged well, and remains a highlight in Fred's discography IMO."
4,love this product,"so this product did come with some scratches or places where the black paint had white dots from some of the packing, but for the price, it is totally worth it! i love that it is on wheels--which has already come in handy multiple times as we rearrange the nursery. the pad included isn't worth it, so plan on buying a more substantial pad. also, the color is closer to a cherry than an ""espresso."" but i bought this and the matching crib, and for the price, they are really worth it--very cute and up to safety standards."
1,Junk!!!,"Besides the point that 2 pc were broken, i also have to tighten the screws every 2 month, otherwise it shakes away.."
5,Great purchase!,"Excellent product, price and assembly. Looks great when assembled and finish looks expensive. Wheels create options for different rooms, but do not move unless desired."
4,Great for the price!,"I was excited to find a changing table for under $100 in the wood stain I wanted. The changing table arrived the same week I ordered it. It's easy to assemble (I'm 6 months pregnant and put it together with minimal help) and looks nice. There is a slight difference in the stain color of the shelves and frame, but you can only tell if you're looking for it. I didn't realize the table will only hold 30lbs of weight, but for the price you really can't go wrong. I love having the lower shelves for storage baskets and having the option to put wheels on. I'm very pleased with this purchase."
5,"Great changing table, great price.","We bought this for my Mom's house as she watches our baby during the day. It went together easily, is a good height, doesn't take up too much space, and the storage shelves are handy. Also, the design is nice and fits in well with the cottage design of the room it's in."
2,Wanted to love it...really.,"I love the look of this table. I am a stickler for quality wood-made items, and it was difficult to find another changing table in espresso on wheels that I can move to and from my nursery. We got this home, and my husband is struggling to put it together because one of the threaded inserts that the bolts screw into was forced in by the manufacturer, and the threads were damaged in the process. Looks like we'll be returning this to get it fixed. This is my first ever Graco product, and I am not impressed with the quality one bit. Maybe I sound a bit spoiled, but I guess this is what I get for buying a mass-made product."
4,Looks nice. wheels don't lock well,"Pros:It does the job.looks nice in baby's roomfits 12x12 storage cubbies on the shelveshas wheels, we can easily move the cart into the bathroom - we prefer dressing the baby before leaving the bathroom.Cons:There is one lock on one of the wheels, but I can still move the cart when it's locked."
1,Cracked leg,Received this station with MGf defects.... cracked leg and plank .....so did not find it fit for baby nursery....unsafe! We decided to return and cancel order
4,Steady changing table,Steady changing table. Have not use it yet with my baby. I like the color. Good product for the price.
4,"Sturdy, easy to assemble, great quality","Bought this as a 2nd changing table to have on the main floor of our house. It is sturdy, was easy to put together, has never needed tightening (after daily use for over 5 months), and looks great with our furniture.I was skeptical about the pad when I first received it, because it seems very thin, but have found it to provide more than enough cushion. The shelves hold a ton of baby supplies."
2,Review,overall the product design is okay but the the wood in not good and very weak. I thought that wood will be much stronger but I am not happy with the quality.
2,not that great...,"First of all, this is not espresso. It is cherry and it does not match our espresso crib at all. Secondly, don't follow the instructions. It tells you to put all the side bars in first then slide in the boards. That does not work, we totally scratched the top one bad, the color chipped off very easily. You need to do one side and then put the boards in and then put the other side on. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone looking for espresso. If you have cherry wood then this will be fine."
3,Not great quality and wrong color,"We ordered this to match our Graco Lauren crib in walnut, the 2 arrived at the same time, we recently unpackaged the items and my husband put together the dresser first, the color seemed a little dark but it did say 'walnut' on the box, there were scratches on one of the shelves and a couple of the leg poles were splintered, then when we unpackaged the crib we saw that the color of the crib was much lighter, a true 'walnut' color so I can only assume that the dresser they sent us was actually 'espresso' so now we have to go through the hassle of re-packaging and returning the dresser, not great fun when you're 9 months pregnant and anxious to get your nursery completed!"
1,Cracked & Bad Paint job,"The paint on this changing table had several imperfections. Also there were several cracks on the legs. One of the rollers on the legs kept falling off. I had it for one day, and then decided to return it because the quality was so bad."
1,This color is not espresso,"Received the changing table and unpacked it only to find that this ""espresso"" piece of furniture is anything but. This is a cherry wood and it is very, very red. At first I thought that I had simply been sent the wrong color item, but upon opening the matching crib, I found it to be a perfect red match. If you are looking for cherry wood furniture, then the Graco Lauren set is a well-priced, well-made set; but if you want espresso furniture, look elsewhere."
4,Nicer then I expected.,"Easy to assemble. We didn't need the wheels and it looks fine with out them. Easy to assemble, sturdier than similar priced ones."
3,"Good Quality, bad color","This was very easy to put together. And it seems to be good quality. Walnut is hard to come by and I needed a changing table to match the walnut crib we already had. Beware, the color on this IS NOT walnut....it is cherry. It looks way to red next to the crib."
3,Looks good but isn't as sturdy as I wanted,"It looked much darker in the picture-and that is what I wanted. 'Espresso' just depends on what company makes a pieceof furniture and can run from light to dark, so I will forgive them for that. It was easy to put together and looks fairly nice.It is a little less sturdy than I had hoped and when baby wiggles, it wiggles! But all in all I am fairly satisfied forthe price."
2,Wrong Parts in Box,"We received this as a gift, and when we went to set it up discovered that the wrong parts were included. It is supposed to have rails with different groove sizes to accept varying thickness shelves. All our rails had the same size groove, and none were wide enough to accept the top shelf. There is obviously little quality control to have allowed it to be shipped like that. We are following up with the manufacturer, but it is very inconvenient to not have use of it in the meantime. Now we have to spend our time fixing what the manufacturer should have had right in the first place."
2,This is ok not great.,The first one arrived damaged .. NOT damaged in the shipping ... obviously damaged and sent from the factory in an unsatisfactory condition. Amazon replaced it immediately! I love my Prime membership! The 2 table still has a couple of less than perfect spots but for the price I guess it's ok. Probably wouldn't but Graco again tho.
4,Changing Table,"The dressing table is very nice and matches the crib perfectly. I like having all the space for storage, and it is great not to have to bend over every time I need to change the baby. The only thing I didn't like was the pad - it's very thin. I changed the pad on mine out for one of the rounded munchkin ones which fit perfectly (and baby doesn't roll into the bar that way)."
4,Good value,"I just recieved this changing table, it was easy to assemble until I realized it was missing one of the rails (the one that holds the changing table!!) I called Graco and was told the part was on backorder and it would take at least 4 weeks! However, after speaking to a supervisor they were able to find the missing part and fedex it to me. I'm very happy with the changing table - you can't beat the value. It's not pottery barn quality and I don't expect it to last forever, but we only expect to use it for a few years so this is perfect for th eprice. It looks nice, my mom actually asked me if it was from pottery barn!"
4,Excellent quality but your baby will become too tall for it,"I bought the white one and it is really good quality. It was perfect for what we needed it for, a temporary changing table for the baby while he slept in our room in a cradle. He is now 4.5mos and 92% height and it won't be long that we won't be able to use this as he will be too tall and will need to go to our larger one.I use wicker baskets below and it works really well to hold diapers and other baby items. The other drawback is that since it is a short length, there is no convenient place to put the wipes.Overall I was really happy with it though."
3,Blemished and shipped anyway,"This is a great piece of furniture for the price! This is a large changing table, so if you're just wanting a changing table you should look for something smaller. The size is great for storage on the shelves, etc and to utilize this as a piece of furniture for the nursery. Just make sure you have the room. Espresso color is true and pretty. The wheels are sturdy and a wonderful asset! The foam pad included is a nice idea but very thin and slides, even with security straps buckled and tightened. You need to purchase a separate changing pad. Main reason for three stars: one of the headboards I received all carefully packed away without any damage to the box was blemished pretty bad. There are several big and small scratches without stain. There are horrible globs of stain coverup caked onto multiple areas."
2,Broke During Assembly,"I wish I was able to have luck with this item. When we were putting it together, the leg split right in half as we were putting a screw in. I've returned it and am trying a different brand."
1,Major Disappointment,"... I was thrilled with the vocabulary levels, plot devices, and character depictions in the original series (I read #3, ""The Bungalow Mystery""), and fairly impressed also with the ""Nancy Drew Files"". However, the ""On Campus"" series is a travesty. It is a sensationalized,... and dumbed-down version of a classic series. ..."
1,Uh-uh!!,"I purchased this book, thinking that it would be as good as the originals- and I was wrong. This (no offense, anybody, I just don't like it) trashes Nancy and Ned's relationship- I consider it downright stupid. For those of you who want Nancy and Ned to stay together, don't bother with this one."
2,A little disappointed...,"I am an avid Nancy Drew reader and I was looking for some material for older kids to try. I bought this one and was a little disappointed with it. First of all, the plot was a little amature. I mean stealing? And second of all, the fact that Nancy just ditched Ned was a little mean! You can't just drop a couple after they were together for practicaly the whole series. That's just what I thought of it."
4,good book,"Nancy Drew is now starting her freshman year in college with her friends George and Bess. Here they have to face new people, new loves and new mysteries. A thief is loose in the dorm and it is up to Nancy to find him.Good book, I liked it a lot."
4,NOT AS MUCH MYSTERY BUT STILL HAS THE SAME EXCITMENT.,THE AUTHOR DESCRIBES THE COLLAGE ATMOSPHERE VERY WELL. I LOVED IT !~~~~MAINE GIRL~~~~
1,"Man, was I dissapointed!!","Some people say they like this book cus it's more real. I thinks that's stupid! It makes life look like something its not, like how everything goes wrong with the girls and their love life, PLEASE!! If you ask me the best Nacy Drew seires is Nancy Drew Files. In that seiris she does not seem to fake (like she sometimes did in the origanal books) yet I did not get deppresd like I did in this book. I mean com'on reading is for enjoyment!! Read the files they are sooooo much better she's older and more mature!! The Files still have love and stuff, but don't spend half the book talking about it. Read the Files!!! (my opinion, some people think differently!!)"
5,Great!! Never thought NancyDrews would be so good,"This book really shows how Nancy changes. Anyways, Ned is really getting old. It's good to know she's maturing, I mean, please, the originals might her sound like a 10 year old. I think this book is awesome and the other on campus ones are great too!"
2,bad price on below average product,these undersized and overpriced packets of miso soup has additives like 'dry fish powder' and i did not notice the small print of ingrediants before buying and accepting shipment. i have other products ordered through amazon that are great and repeatedly shipped to my door but this product is inferior and i wish i could get a refund on unused and still sealed portion.
4,For boxing fans only,"I agree with the last reviewer that the bonus material is the real gem here. The actual 'documentary' is just a mediocre reenactment of Braddock's career, but the footage of four of Braddock's fights are worth watching alone. The famous bout between Braddock and Max Baer is shown in it's entirety, as well as Braddock's bout with Joe Louis. I found it amusing how awkward these guys looked compared to modern day boxers, but don't get me wrong, these guys were tough. It was amazing how Max Baer's mannerisms were exactly how they were portrayed in 'Cinderella Man.' Another thing I noticed which was not in the film was the fact that Baer outweighed Braddock by twenty lbs. in their fight. This might not sound like much, but anyone who knows boxing will tell you that this is a huge weight difference. If you just liked the film 'Cinderella Man' for the story, you probably won't enjoy this dvd, but if you're a huge boxing fan like me, it's definitely worth the watch."
2,CINDERELLA MAN DVD,"IT WASN'T WHAT I EXPECTED IT TO BE. I THINK IT A GOOD TRY TO RELIVE EVENTS AND EMOTIONAL PARTS OF JIMS' AND FAMILY'S LIFE, BUT IT JUST DOESNT DO IT FOR ME. MAYBE BECAUSE I ALREADY KNOW THIS MANS LIFE IN EVERY DETAIL THAT THIS DVD SEEMS A BIT LIGHT IN REFLECTING THE REAL THING. I'M STILL HAPPY THAT I BOUGHT THE DVD, BUT I WAS EXPECTING SOMETHING DIFFERENT."
2,disappointed!,The product arrived damaged; I returned it asap! It seems that too many businessmen out there don't appreciate the good business sense of properly packaging and protecting the products that they sell or bother to make sure that they're in perfect shape to begin with!
1,This was boring.,"It did have a bit of skill, but honestly I could have slept while reading it if that was possible."
4,"Great story, flawed method.","Reading the other reviews of this book, I'm reminded of a quote from one of my favorite, although little known Sean Connery movies, where he plays an Arab pirate. At one point Connery says to his second in command: ""It is good."" ""What is good?"", replies the other man. ""It is good to know where we are going,"" answers Connery. Alas, Herzog and his men didn't know where they were going, and spent a month wandering around looking. It would have been good to send out an initial recon group to find the mountain before they started out. Or, to paraphrase an english adventurer, ""to lose a pack animal is unfortunate; to lose an entire mountain seems downright careless."""
5,Gentlemen Climbers,"This book is so good I never get it back after I have lent it out, hence I am replacing it again! I am especially moved by the outstanding character of the climber. When faced with disaster, pain and the incredible odds against them in this daunting undertaking the writer and his friends maintain true dignity and outstanding bravery. I was moved to tears by this book and have gained a respect for these ""old"" climbers that has not been exceeded by any other mountaineering adventure books I have read."
5,Met expectations,"The book arrived exactly as advertised. It wasn't the cheapest used book, but the quality was what I expected and it was worth the extra money."
5,Looking for the mountain...,"In an age of satellite photography, GPS, data links, etc, it is fascinating how these climbers spend day after day TRYING TO FIND one of the tallest peaks in the world! All the maps are wrong, and figuring out where Annapurna is becomes a major obstacle to climbing it!!"
4,"Annapurna, a team's quest and no wineing (Jon Krakauer)","The story of how the team's sumit on Annapurna and the discriptions of life and death mistakes made. Written with no regret or wineing. If you read Into Thin Air and liked the adventure, Everest will look like a walk in the park. These guys dit it with wool wax cotton shells and leather boots and no oxygen.Great read."
4,Annapurna,Got it for my husband...he enjoyed it and I haven't read it yet. It's an old treasure. Thanks for sharing it with us!
3,Annapurna: the heroic facade,"As an account of heroism, comradeship and self-sacrifice, this is a stunning book. It's inspired generations of climbers. If you're of a macabre turn of mind, it's worth reading for the frostbite scenes alone.There's just one catch: It isn't really the truth. Beyond simply presenting the viewpoint of one participant, Annapurna involves whitewashing and even, more or less, lies. Dialogue scenes are Herzog's after the fact inventions, and events are manipulated to present a picture of unanimous heroism, with Herzog always in the lead.I used to recommend this book as a matter of course. Now, I think anyone reading it should read Roberts' True Summit, and the writings of Herzog's team members, as well. That's the only way you'll get any picture of what the first ascent of Annapurna was really like."
4,Good descriptions of the consequences of mountaineering,A good overall book. Lacks a lot of the detail of the ascent and descent found in current books. Focuses more on the strength and determination that each man had in this expedition. Has some gory details of frostbite damage and descriptions of then current treatment practices.
4,Interesting and Inspiring,"The story line in ""Annapurna"" rivals that of the recent book, ""Into Thin Air"", by John Krakauer, but being half a century old, and having been translated from the French, is written in a slightly less exciting prose. It tells of a three month French expedition to the Dhaulagiri and Annapurna region of the Himalayas which began with much correcting of erroneous maps, and ended in near disaster. Two men did summit, but suffered severe frostbite for their efforts. Also interesting were some of the difficulties in transporting equipment from the railways in India to and from the Himalayas, which are probably not so great for moderen climbers. I enjoyed the read, and recommend it to anyone interested in high adventure stories."
4,Slow in Beginning but Page-Turner at End,"This was an excellent book, slow in the beginning but a page-turner at the end. I would have given five stars had the beginning not been so slow. Herzog's did an outstanding job at tackling the book using his personal notes, the official expedition logs and expedition members' personal diaries. The harrowing escape with a night spent huddled together made for quite excitement. However before this, the book was rather mundane and boring. This should not preclude anyone from reading the book because expeditions can sometimes be rather boring. This is a ""must read"" for anyone reading mountaineering books."
4,When a group really is super,4 1/2Fans of instrumentally intense rock ambition will have hit the mother lode with this exquisite compilation.
4,"Good capacity, good tools","Replacing an iPod battery is NOT for everyone. You have to be forceful but delicate to open the case. Experience helps. This Sonnet battery is not the highest capacity you can get, but for the price the part is good and the spunger tools are excellent."
1,None,"Admittedly, I did not purchase this whole book, but when I downloaded the sample, all I got was the cover picture, the publishing info, etc. Not a word from the book itself. As a customer (and they do say ""the customer is always right"") I hereby command Amazon to feel bad about this."
3,"Useful information, but you have to work to find it.","Author Robinson, who benignly describes himself as an ""anti-capitalist,"" provides some useful information and guidelines for unsophisticated non-profit agencies contemplating social entrepreneurship. Unfortunately, he cloaks the good stuff with so much undisguised leftist, liberal activist commentary, he spoils it for those of us who tend to more moderate or conservative views about the merits of capitalism (historically the only successfully sustainable economic model). Still, most non-profits will find practical food for thought, even if they have to ""hold their nose"" while swallowing it."
1,A minus one star product,"Product limits you to 25 attempts, then register, or register at the first attempt. Attempting to register this product is frustrating, the product insists on a pre-determined country, if it is UK, then it searches for the UK internet output/modem, for USA it declines all attemtpts to register, giving an error ""no internet connection"". After various attempts to register it insists on a phone number. Finally I abondoned my quest, and put the disk to rest...................."
2,How can I possibly give this cd such a bad review?,"I purchased this cd after only hearing the brilliantly arranged/performed ""Katie Cruel"" on Pandora.com. Absolutely fascinating! The reviews of this cd here on Amazon were so positive. And from what I understand, Bert Jansch is very influential in the folk scene. The cd art work is very nice, the guitar playing here is drop-dead beautiful, the tunes are all good, but why does he have to sing lead on most of his songs??? One kinder reviewer here related Bert's voice to a sinus infection. I believe it is worse. He regularly drifts into degrees of flatness, has awful phrasing, and frequent unintelligible mumblings that are simply not musical. Sort of reminds me of another great, John Renbourn, only not even that good.I will not continue to listen to this cd, despite the great guitar. too bad for me. I truly hope I can find some of Bert's music that is performed without his singing. If I do I will probably purchase it."
5,This is best from Britney!,"Best concert! This is the best dvd, good music. Just one bad comment, hate SNL script in it. Britney rocks!"
1,WARNING!!!!!!!!!,"I bought this Mannequin Head, and when I opened the box it wasn't the Mannequin head that's in the picture. The hair ISN'T Human Hair, it's an synthetic hair. When I tried to style the hair using a Curling Iron the hair melted like plastic. Human Hair does not melt. So this is FALSE ADVERTISEMENT. BEWARE!!!!!!!"
3,Dummy head,"The product is good, I would have liked for the hair to be a little nappier for my purposes. But it took forever for me to get it, like a month, it got lost in the mail or something and they had to send it out again. The seller did contact me back and got it out to me within a week when they realized that I had not recieved it."
2,Generic to a point of nearly useless.,"Twenty years ago I slept with my Chilton's book and wouldn't have traded it for anything. I bought this to get a better mechanical knowledge of my Durango, expecting a book of the caliber I used to know.This book is highly generic. The instructions and descriptions of procedures are very vague. If you are able to use them you already know too much to be consulting a book. And the photos, well let me tell you. I don't even think most of these pictures are actually of a Durango. They certainly look nothing like the Durango sitting in my garage. This book is almost completely useless. Just don't buy it."
5,Added 3.5 inches to my arms in just 6 weeks,"To be the best, recovery from training is a must. In addition to replacing high-energy compounds such as creatine phosphate, ATP and glycogen, CELLMASS replaces electrolytes, all of which increases one's resistance to fatigue and overall work capacity. That is why it is said, ""The CELLMASS you take today, is the CELLMASS you feel tomorrow.""I have consistently taken this product for 30+ years. This product is great, 5 stars."
1,Savage from garbage ???,"We ordered this from Nature and Herbs fulfilled by Amazon, so we thought we will get a good product. When we opened the package, it was a horrid sight. Some bottles were crack and dried fluid everywhere. It must have cracked long time ago. Some labels were torn and missing, so it must be like that when it was packaged. It sure like someone pick it out of the reject piles and repackage it. The expiry date is a laughable small piece of paper seems like produced by a typewritter or printer. I honestly cannot see how anyone can ship this kind of garbage to a customer. If I could give this review a zero star, I would !!!!"
3,a few bottles broken,I received my box of Royal King Brand Ginseng Royal Jelly to find that the box was stuck shut. As I got it open it was clear that some of the bottles had broken. I think these were probably broken before the were shipped to me which accounts for the low price. Only a few bottles were broken which left a sticky mess but I rinsed off the rest of the bottles and so far the contents seem fine otherwise.
5,Outstanding Monitors,"I'm a producer/director/editor at a network television production company. We've used these M-Audio BX5a monitors in most of our edit bays for several years now and have been very pleased with their performance. They produce crisp, clear sound for voice, music and effects. They're solid, look nice and feature cool blue pilot lights on front between the woofer and tweeter.Highly recommended for post-production audio."
2,Not impressive,"I'm an M-Audio fan, I love their pre-amps, but these really miss the mark. There is a huge lack of bass which has lead to many problems with mixing my music. When I showed the re-engineered sound to my director, the results weren't good. I mixed the audio flat but it played with more bass than hip-hop music. These were a big disappointment. Save for awhile more and treat yourself to a good pair of monitors."
2,Buyer Beware,"I purchased these monitors through Amazon.com in November of 2009 and was impressed with the value and the sound quality, until the right monitor crapped out two months later (January 2010). Seems to be the on/off switch. M-Audio assesses a support/tech fee after 30 days of ownership and are not at all supportive. The seller has yet to contact me about repair, or replacement. I have now read (wish I had before my purchase) about identical problems with these monitors. I would obviously not recommend these, or any M-Audio products to anyone."
4,Great For It's Price,"I just got these speakers today. I've read mixed reviews about these speakers so I expected either really poor quality speakers or really awesome speakers. My first impression of these speakers was that it was lacking some bass. But a sub could fix that problem. The mids and highs are very clear. Well I wasn't expecting too much, considering the price I paid. So all in all, they are excellent for its price. If you are an amateur or a beginning home studio recorder, get these speakers. They look really cool too."
1,Cheaply built... Just google them,"Im not using these in my studio... Rather, for my TV sound system. These actually sound surprisingly good... They'd be great if MAudio didnt cheap out on components. Just Google the capacitor issues these things have. Its a well known issue that causes one or both of them to go dead suddenly and the company is no help with helping fix the issue. I've bought 3 single ones to complete my pairs (and conveniently the company doesn't sell them single) I'm about to just throw them in my junk room and buy something else"
5,great speakers,"great sound with lots of power BUT you need to use the Line out of a soundcard.i have a cheap MSI 945gmf-3 ,otherboard with the onboard realtek audio soundacrd, and the sound is great.the sound using a laptop out is not nearly as good, actually rather poor. on my mac aluminum 13"", the power is weak, with the volume on the speaker at max power.so that should influence you choice of speaker.NB., i am using the XLR input with a 9 or 10' (1/4 plug to XLR)cable from B&H.; very nice"
3,Keeps its bounce,"My only issue is the pump tip can get stuck and you can loose some inflation, but otherwise it works as advertised."
5,good for office work,"I bought this ball as an alternative to a regular office chair. I am able to work on my abdominal muscles while surfing the web, or other computer work. It helps me to stay focused on the work and not get frustrated with not being able to move around. It is exactly what I was looking for."
3,the preceding review is total bull,"Sodium benzoate is a salt of benoic acid, and has nothing to do with benzene. If you are going to spout ignorant nonsense, you really should identify it as such"
1,WORST Peanut Sauce EVER,This doesn't even taste like peanuts! It's just vinegar. The people who made this crud have never tasted real THAI peanut sauce. DO NOT EVER BUY THIS!
1,toxic ingredients- VERY unhealthy...get another brand,"This product contains sodium benzoate aka ""benzene"" ... it's been proven that benzene destroys the immune system. In fact without benzene in a patient AIDS can not thrive. If you have taken this toxin you MUST detox it out of your body by taking vitamin b-2 (www.lef.org is a nonprofit organization that sells the purest vitamins and publishes the absolute LATEST scientific research) For more information on benzene please read The Cure For All Diseases by Dr. Hulda R.

5,A Great Book!,My daughter received this book for Christmas (she's 6) and we both love it. I've since given it as a birthday gift 3 times. It would be perfect given with a sock monkey.
2,...,"I love the song ""Over the Line"" which has been playing on the radio, so I took a chance and bought this CD...bad idea. OTL is the only good song on it. The rest are just too gimmicky to even listen to. I know, I know...what can we expect from LA boys trying to sing country. Die hard Bellamy Bro fans might like this CD, but that's about it."
4,Tuneful 20s Musical with lots of humor,"Although I have never heard the Carol Channing original, for the most part I enjoy this show. The three best songs (Diamonds, Bye Bye Baby, Little Girl from Little Rock) were transferred to the Monroe film, but there are other gems here as well, including ""Delightful Down in Chile"" ""I Love What I'm Doing"" ""Gentlemen Prefer Blondes"" and ""Keeping Cool with Coolidge"".Karen Prunzik is great as Dorothy, but KT Sullivan as Loreilei has had to grow on me. These songs have 20s-sounding arrangements, so it wasn't quite the sexed up film version I had grown used to. The other principles are strong, but the orchestra has a weak synthesized sound in some places.The show is not as popular as say, Oklahoma, but definately a worthwhile buy and something I would like to see done more often!"
3,George Dvorsky is Sensational,I have had the pleasure of hearing the wonderfully talented voice of George Dvorsky many times. As each year passes George outdoes himself. His voice is a definite gift along with his extraordinary talent for acting.
1,Video Quality Terrible,This tape looks like a home made copy of the commercial Let It Be VHS complete with home made label on the tape. The video and audio quality of this thing is horrible.RIP OFF! Don't waste your money!
5,cool,Goku a super saiyan that is what Vegeta says as he gets his butt whupped by racoom. Then onwards it goes
5,WE WANT ALL OF DB/DBZ/DBGT,Isnt this a shame how we only got what cartoon networks replays and even thats incomplete!. Yeah these tapes are cool ive seen them all but i want more i want EVERYTHING!and i dont think im alone here in the United states. only thing ive seen of DBGT is some crappy MPEG videos from the net but they looked Awesome.i say we all gather together sign a petition or somthing so that we could get The whole series back to back. Gotta go DBz is on
3,it's a pretty good movie but it left out key scenes,Scince I've seen all the Japanese versions of DBZ and DBGT i kinda spoiled the movie for me and the action seemed dull scince there are so much cooler fights further in the series. But this includes some of the moments hinting that finnaly Goku is goin to go super sayain. But this is a must have for all the new comers to DBZ. So all in all I gave it three stars.
4,awesome,"I thought this volume of the series had a lot of good fights scenes and the dialouge was excellent especally when Goku arrives and challenges Recoome and says ""I saw an opening that screamed attack, so I did."" and just the fights between the Earth Special Forces plus Vegetta versus the Ginyu Force was as good as any fights in the series. I can't wait for episodes 54 and beyond so we can the te most insane beef ever, Frieza vs Goku"
3,Couldn't Learn to Whistle,"This is a very clever book. Personally, I could not get my olives to make any audible noise (you take the pimento out of the middle and blow, right? Its not as easy as it sounds). There are plenty of other tricks here to make the book worth your while. This is particularly good as a gift for someone at work--it gives everyone at the office party something to do!"
4,The Horizontal Lieutenant,"A good light hearted comedy about the military. Will keep a smile on your face with an occasional chuckle. Not as many laugh out loud moments as the best comedies, but better than average."
5,Love the Plum Sauce,"I use it in many, many thing. Good for dipping Costco breaded shrimp, for example. Good for those with allergies to other products."
1,What an uncomfortable mix!,"If you want to get confused, do not hesitate to buy this book !! You will find in it tattwas and rune practices, siberian chamanism, pranayama, buddhists mantras, the evocation of yidams, etc... This is a perfect, but rather unhelpful ""pot pourri"" of various religious and magickal traditions. The book is therefor rather useless and rather expensive regarding his (poor) content."
1,Not even worth 1 star,"This book is the biggest wast of time, money and paper I have ever seen. First off the title might well be called THE WICCAN VERSION OF VOODOO. This book is filled with nonesence. The author presents no bibliography but clearly takes many passages from Jambalaya by Luisah teish along with the very same drawuings she has in her book. Please Please Please dont waste your money on this awfull book."
2,worth it for the 'Vodou Pentacle' illustration,"Entertaining. Not accurate, but has nice illustrations. I purchased this for the 'Vodou Pentacle' ( Web ) pic. I have a friend with a tattoo of the 'Vodou Pentacle' and I respect the concept, as explained to me, by an Initiate.However, the book, itself.... well, it is mis-titled. This book is a slap-dash, thrown-together collection of ""stuff."" If you are looking for a book about ""Voodoo Rituals,"" this isn't what you are looking for. Yet, it is entertaining and has some useful tidbits about various (not voodoo or Vodou) magickal entities and whatnot. I would not recommend buying this book because of the title--which is misleading. Some of the stuff in this book, I would consider ""Hoodoo"" and, maybe ""Voodoo,"" but not ""Vodou.""I agree with the person who said this appears to be a ""Personal Journal."" I just do not understand why so many Magickal systems are lumped-together under the title of the book."

5,Beginners Unite!,"I found this book because of an ex-girlfrind of mine. When I left college and dorm food I was left stranded only knowing how to cook hotdogs and eggs. This book has simple, easy to follow recipies, with a difficulty rating for each dish. This has transfromed my bachelor life forever!"
3,not a good deal. cheaply made,Very cheap and paid more for shipping than the product so it doesnt make sense to return. the batterry is not a good fit and connection is iffy while charging. you may have to do it twice. also the ac adaptor does not fit in the slot to well. i bought another batterry but it did not work at all.
3,"a lovely pece of piano music, I wanted some sounds of the sea","The music is lovely, if you like piano music as a relaxer. I much prefer album of soothing sea gull sounds, and the waves crashing in and going out."
5,subtle sophistication,"I just want to second the comment that Michael Jones, among others such as David Lanz and Jim Chappell, are worlds more evocative than artists such as Yanni or Tesh, who unfortunately tend to dominate the perceptions of many when it comes to the genre of ""New Age."" In short, give ""After the Rain"" a try. As a first look behind the stereotype, it might open the way to all kinds of comparable great music."
4,Good Coverage,"Very good manual to get you through the basics and help you understand a system that sometimes feelscompletely unattainable. This topic can be difficult and no one book can cover it all, But NOLO guides pave theway for breaking down legal topics in a clean, clear and precise manner."
1,This book is very vague.,"This book skips all the important details, it is fine for someone who is NOT going to Small Claims Court. This book is useless to the person who IS being sued."
4,A Good Reference Book On Small Claims Court,"This book has information on how to prepare your case, win in court and collect your money. You can learn how to determine the damages, mediate the settlement, write a demand letter, file and serve papers, prepare for court and collect your money when you win. A big plus, this book includes information for all 50 States. For 24-hour access to straightforward legal solutions check out www.nolo.com. The author, Ralph Warner, helped found Nolo in 1971, and is one of the recognized pioneers of the self-help law movement.Keep in mind that on some smaller cases you have no choice but to work the case without a lawyer since the amount of money involved may not be enough to cover the expense of an attorney. This book will be a lifesaver."
4,Good book but why no cd or templates?,"This is a very good book that covers all the essential elements required for small claims court. In keeping with NOLO's easy to understand guidance, this is user-friendly yet comprehensive enough to walk anyone through the entire process. Learn how to prepare, what you will need and how to complete many of the most common forms.Unfortunately, NOLO decided not to include a cd or forms or templates. Since this is a routine part of many current offerings and would dramaticaly enhance the usability of this book, I'm really not sure why. Undoubtedly there may be changes and updates needed but again...that is true of many other legal related books published by NOLO. I've docked one star for the lack of cd/additional resources...otherwise, an excellent resource perfect for small business owners, landlords and others that may need basic advice on small claims court."
4,Great for temporary transport,"These are pretty cheap looking/filmsy material, but they do the job to transport cupcakes. Especially works well with a good box to hold them in. Would prefer to have seen a little heavier material, but as a beginner, this works fine."
2,Not much,"Very disappointing. Not much a selection of recipes. Very small book. I've bought other ""Better Homes and Gardens"" recipe books and this is definitely not their best."
1,Don't Order This!,"This ships without the Curriculum Starter Cards. I ordered and received an 11 page guide to using the Starter Cards. I was told by the customer service rep at Amazon that they were sorry I misunderstood the contents. They advised me to return the item, which I did. I am trying to save anyone else the frustration of getting a guide to using nonexistent cards for $40."
1,never received book,I've been in contact with the book supplier and have waited now for a month for the book. Each time i write them they tell me to write back in a week.Very disappointed to not have this gift to put under the tree.
3,"Decidedly NOT ""very good"" condition","The price was great, but the vendor misrepresented the condition of the book. A book in ""very good"" condition does not have a torn cover, and it definitely does not smell like cigarette smoke! I had to let the book air out for days before I could give it to the children's library I donated it to."
4,Question for someone who owns this book.,"Does anyone know what kind of dog is jumping with the German Shepherd on the bottom right hand part of page 10? I believe it is not a pure breed, but does anyone have any idea of what it might be a mix of, b/c I just got a puppy, and it nearly looks identical. Thanks"
2,A bit disappointing,"I should have known not to order a book that lacks the 'look inside' feature, but Ortho books are usually very good. This book was disappointing (to me, at least) for the following reasons: too basic, not enough information, and it does NOT include photograghs of the finished landscapes. Mostly I just do not like the illustrations--fuzzy chalk drawings that are hard on the eyes and lack definition. Selected ideas for building fences, pergolas, etc. consist of simple line drawings and no detailed instructions. Sorry Ortho, I've seen better."
5,beginning designers,This book is great for people wanting to learn how to draw out and layout basic landscapes for their home. I would recomend this book to anyone. i learned alot from this book. Plus it shows different types of layouts
3,Decent but oversized,"The fabric is very nice, soft and silky. It washes well but the color is not very rich and tends to get lighter in the wash even when no bleach is used. Most impportant it is not a queen size. It is much much bigger and had to be tucked in all around. It is labeled queen but it is close to king but not quite that either."
4,"Jewish Mothers, Italian Mothers, Any Mothers!","I was browsing in a bookstore one day about 15 years ago and I came across Dan Greenburg's book, ""How to be a Jewish Mother."" It was so funny I couldn't put it down, and I ended up buying it for my mother for Christmas. Obviously, that means that we are not Jewish, but the book has an appeal for almost any faith or culture. Most mothers display the same types of behavior that Dan attributes to his mother, such as looking worried and pained but insisting that nothing is wrong, and reminding everyone that someday they will be gone and won't be bothering us anymore. I will need to search through about ten bookcases at home to find our copy of the book, but it will be worth it!"
5,oy vey! What a great book this is.,"I am not going to lie to you. I am neither Jewish nor a mother, but I fell in love with this book the first time I read it. I don't remember how old I was exactly (somewhere between age ten and age fifteen). It was brilliant! For starters, the diagrams and illustrations about everything from appropriate footage for swimming (any water covering more than the ankles is too deep) and appropriate characteristics for a good Jewish daughter are illustrated to the tenth degree. This book is charming and funny. We also get a good sense of the kind of mothering Dan Greenburg experienced, as a young boy, and how this may have affected him in later life(!). You hear the saying, ""A man marries his mother, when he marries his wife, and a woman marries her father when she marries her husband."" I definitely think that there is some truth to that. Read this book and find out, through pictures and stories just how true that is!"
2,The least accessible of all Residents recordings,"The Big Bubble has an intersting, if not original, concept: a musical group makes recordings in their native language in defiance of the law, and become a hit. Is this a dream the Residents have for themselves? This is a part of the entire Mole legend that the Residents dreamed up, and have used in four previous recordings (Mark of the Mole, The Mole Show Live, The Tale of Two Cities, Intermission) However, as a whole, the Big Bubble is not a success. Using some of the most unlistenable singing the Residents ever released, and some of the most unlistenable music. I say this from the angle of a long-time (since 1978) Residents fan.There are some interesting cuts, especially Cry for Fire (which can be best described as bad sex followed by an incredible orgasm) but get this only if you are a die hard - gotta have it all fan."
3,Disk Format Problems,"When I first used this card with a Nikon Coolpix 4300, it worked for the first 207 photos. Suddenly, my camera showed an error message on the screen saying, ""This card cannot be read."". Even after powering off and on the camera, I had the same error message. I wasn't able to access the card. I wasn't able to access the card on my computer either, through USB card readers or through the camera itself. The computer behaved as though there was no CompactFlash card there, and I continued to receive prompts to insert a disk. According to Windows XP, the format of the card is RAW, when it's really supposed to be FAT32 (or FAT16 or FAT?). Since I can't access the card, I can't format it. At least I was able to recover more than half of those photos with freeware Zero Assumption Digital Image Recovery. Perhaps I merely became unlucky."
5,Super fast memory card,"Using a Nikon Coolpix 2100 (only 2 megapixels) this card is really very fast. It writes almost instantly, it seems, compared to the Lexar card that came with the camera. Even uncompressed 2 megapixel shots write in less than a second, so you can shoot a lot, and for smaller images (like 2 megapixels) the capacity is over 500 compressed, or over 250 uncompressed.... it's great.Lifetime warrantee on the card makes me comfortable it's not going to crap out (I just got it yesterday, so I can't comment on it's longevity, but there's that lifetime warrantee, so...), and it's really affordable from Amazon.com.I recommned this memory card with no reservations."
1,Card conked off after a year of use.,A sandisk card that I'd purchased conked after one year of use. I don't think its worth buying a cheap product that's going to last only a year. I'd rather buy a expensive brand thats going to last me at least 3-4 years.
2,Must Leave Power On to Save Images,"I've known and happily used SanDisk CF cards before, high quality, good price. This Ultra II card comes with some worries. Since CF doesn't write at 9MB/sec, it uses a ""buffer"" to write a small amount (like 4 megs) to an ultra-fast buffer, then the image is slowly transferred to the main card. And there's the problem.I lost every ""last image"" on my trip to Italy. When I powered on the camera, took say 5 pictures, it would record 4 and lose the last image. This is because I was turning the camera off after taking the 5th picture. I needed to leave the camera on another 20 seconds to be sure the memory card finished transfer of the images. So it's very fast, for a small burst of pictures, but LEAVE THE CAMERA ON. I did a lot of ""that's cool!"" pictures... you turn the camera on, take a picture, turn the camera off to save battery life. Mistake. Make sure you REVIEW the images (and not just the temporary image displayed after the picture is taken) before POWERING DOWN."
4,Entertaining,"If you are familiar with the original cast album, some of the performances compare favorably (particularly Marin Mazzie), some unfavorably (Peter Scolari, as compared with William Redfield). As much as I enjoyed it, I am not surprised it as not successful on Broadway."
1,Not worth the cost!,This lasted two months of 30 degree temps. Came out one morning and the whole waterer was frozen solid! For $50 it should last longer than a couple months. Very disappointed.
5,Works great,"I bought this used and it was not totally cleaned up from whoever used it before, but I saved a little money, it works great and my ducks are happy."
1,Defective unit,"It's above 40 degrees outside, so the heater base shouldn't even be on, but the hen's water was so hot it was steaming. It wasn't just the water in the lower lip that they drink from, but when I opened the water container, all of the water was approx the temp of a hot bath. I don't know if the hens have been drinking it, but it would be uncomfortably hot for a human. I will attempt to return the heater and hope that a replacement will not do this, but if you go for this unit, check the water often to make sure that it's shutting off when it's supposed to."
2,lasted only 4 months,"This worked very well for us for about 4 months, then it just stopped heating. We made it just to the end of our winter months, but I certainly expected to use this for more than one season. Disappointing. I'm back on Amazon today, looking for a replacement."
3,"Good information, Difficult to read","This book provided a solid introduction to community psychology, but it was very difficult to read. Most of this was because of small, dense text and numerous citations. They author used proper APA in-text citations, but they were so lengthy and numerous that you would read one sentence followed by a citation and two more sentences and another lengthy citation. The authors did provide solid examples of real life experience and research results that made the material seem salient and meaningful. This is the first edition and the book has a solid foundation, but I hope the next edition is a bit more user-friendly."
3,Nice Photography Book but.......,"The book lacks color pictures. I was surprised that the book did not contain any color pictures. Most of us shoot in color not black and white. Fortunately, I understand most of the things that are explained in the book. Nice for the basics but lacks on color photos."
1,musical self-destruction,"This is the worst CD I've ever heard - it's painful to see how the band apparently systematically destroys the structure of these originally beautiful songs. (The vocals are horrifying) Sure, this CD has all the big Jefferson tunes on it - but do yourself a favor and don't be fooled into buying this cause it's so cheap. I actually suspect this is some kind of bootleg of a live concert. This CD should never have been produced"
5,FROM BACK COVER,"NOTHING HURTS WORSE THAN PERFECT LOVEBetty Sue is a nationwide sensation. What happens to her unwilling body once a week, every week, is haunting, horrifying... and fascinating to millions.The TV says it's a miracle. The Church says it's a fake. Both are wrong. Only a priest tormented by lust, who is willing to trade body for soul, can penetrate the unholy secret of The Piercing..."
3,It's ok is just right,"It felt soft when i took out of the package and immediately put into the wash. It came out feeling a little rougher. I slept on it well last night but it's just not as soft as what I'm used to. I think with more use it could get better. I will continue to use it though. The sheets are extremely deep, too."
2,disappointing,"there was nothing, either aesthetically or eroticaly, to justfy the sale of this book."
2,Two heads needed!,"I feel I must stress this point to interested buyers - more than 90% of photos are faceless, trimmed at the chin or neck. Those with partial faces are deliberately angled or off-focused. Technical brilliance aside, for me it just did not work. Many of the photos, in my opinion, are 'rip-offs' of Mapplethorpe and Quiroz. It's like watching the frame by frame reshoot of 'Psycho'by Gus Van Sant. Paying homage is one thing, being inspired is another, but when an image is almost identical - it's rather lame.Nothing confrontational or visually feral here, the front and back covers might just be the two best attempts. Don't waste your money."
1,A Few Quick Pointers For Potential Buyers,"-It is a small, soft cover book. Not a great coffee table book.-Images are shown in black and white.-There are no face shots.-In case it wasn't immediately apparent, the focus is squarely on the penis.With all of that in mind, I have to say that I really loved this book. Giovanni is quite brave here - he acknowledges and embraces the eroticism and desire associated with the male member. Cropping out their faces removes the distraction of personality, and allows Giovanni to accomplish his goal of having the reader focusing on the variation, individuality, and overall beauty of the organs between these men's legs.The images push the boundaries of what is regarded as art, but the photos are never vulgar or pornographic. After reading the background to the cover image, even that can be seen as an expression of fraternity and male solidarity rather than sexuality.Great book, great photos, well worth buying."
4,Pretty Good,"this book is pretty good. the picture quality is OK. it would be better if the prints were in a larger format, but overall great photos."
1,What do you expect?,This sucks. I had a feeling it would. Everyone is ugly and can't play their guitars.
5,Enjoy these episodes while you can...,"...Because the upcoming episodes are 90% filler. Heck, the rest of the episodes could be described as spam on tape-- BUT, these first few episodes are very good even for fans of real anime like Tenchi Muyo or Evangelion.The bottom line is Pokémon should've been an OAV series, not a TV series. This is probably the only very good volume that you should pick up. See the rest on TV instead of wasting another $15."
5,Fantastic!,"It was GREAT! I watch it every day when I come home from shcool. I NEVER spend a day with out watching it. I told Logan that when Pokemon: Mewtwo strikes Back comes out, I'm going to watch it 50 times, and will be the first in the theater when it comes out I'm going to be the first one to buy it!"
4,"These pokemon are sooooo cute, what's not to love!?!?!","This show about the game is one to watch. The plot holds the audience right until the end and the fights between different trainers are awsome! And for the little kids, the adorable pokemon(especially Pikachu) keep them interested. Overall it's a fun and great video to watch!"
2,"Yuck, Good For Awhile But Then DOWN","Okay, it started off funny and witty. Then it started to go down. Then Team Rocket never even came close to winning. Okay NOW MOVE ON. Get The Slayers, or Ranma 1/2 if you want some comedy. None of this garbage. Unless you have a kid then get it. But not if you are over 13. God listen to me. This is like Sailor Moon for boys. YUCK!!!"
5,Gotta catch this video!!!!,"I didn't buy the video, but I saw it on TV.I LOVED it!! I felt really bad for Pikachu.If you have never seen the POKeMON show before this is a great one to start on!!"
5,This is great! Too bad they ruined it near 2004 though...,"There are some great tales in the early Pokemon series I'll probably always remember watching when I was about five or six, and this is what started my spark for loving Pokemon. (When I was seven, I had almost nine hundred Pokemon cards!) Now I'm 11, and I hate it that Pokemon has changed so much. Ash, Brock and Misty rocked just as that threesome, but later they put in that guy to replce Brock... was it Derek or something?? (Someone please correct me or I'll never sleep!) But, I'm trying to get all the earlier TV shhows on DVD, and this is the first I got. But, don't listen to me blabbering. If you're a Pokemon geek, get this DVD!"
5,Coolest anime show that I have seen!!!,"This is a cool new series!! I like Sailor Moon. When I heard this from a friend at school, I let my mom record the episodes on TV. After that, I got HOOKED!! I like Ash, Misty, and Brock!! Pikachu is sooo cute!!"
5,I wish I could be a Pokemon trainer!!!!!,I would give Pokemon 10 stars if I could! I liked the plot and I also liked how Misty and Ash treat each other. I wish Pokemon were real so I could have a Pickachu and an Eevee. I have Seal and Vulpex at home and I want to get all 150!
3,All Pokemon trainers bow to me!!!!,"Yeah, um i saw this video and i thought it was ok. I mean, I am an Moltres,Articuno, and Zapados fan, so i basicly didn't like the movie because none of my bird friends were on it. When I find a video with them in it then i'll make another review. Overall this movie is O.K."
2,metopod .,pokemon is my favrite show .I HAVE 15 VIDEOS! metopod is olny in this video for a little while. but pikachu and caterpie are in the video a lot . misty hates carrots pepors and bugs (like caterpie) . she is the meanist girl ive ever seen.
3,"Good,but not great","It was good for the 1st episodes.There really wasn't enough action,though-just Ash catching pokemon.The later episodes are better,IMHO."
5,The Best thing I Have ever seen,For all you Pokemonn fans out there you HAVE to get this video it is absouloutly fantastic.
5,Great for pokemon fans!,If you have ever played the game then you'll really like this movie. In the game in only shows little animations of their attacks. In the show it actually shows them attacking. I thought the show had a great plotline to lead-on to more episodes.
1,Bad Anime Series!!!,"It has a stupid plot, bad Character Development, and aweful art!! Pokémon is one of the most aweful Anime I have seen."
1,A complete waste of time.,Why spend Your time gazing at the TV screen watching Pokemon videos when you can curl up with a piece good literature? I highly reccomend the book section of this website.Why spend your time and money on a Junky video you will only watch once? Sarah & Magda
4,"Great, but...","I'm a huge Pokemon fan, even though normally I HATE anime. The voice-overs aren't great in the old episodes, which is practically the only reason this isn't 5 stars."
4,It was great!,"In Pokemon I Choose You, a young boy named Ash, starts his pokemon journey. His goal is to capture all the pokemon in the world.As his first pokemon,Ash chooses Pikachu.Later on in the movie, Ash finds his way to the Viridian pokemon center. There,the center is attacked by team rocket. Next Ash journeys into the Viridian forest,where he catches a caterpie. At the end of the movie,caterpie evolves into metapod."
5,The first three episodes of Nintendo's new TV series!,"""POKEMON I CHOOSE YOU!""-Ash oversleeps on the night of his birthday and his rival Gary gets a Pokemon (stinker Gary is, nya!). Ash eventually meets a reluctant Pikachu. The journey through Route 1 isn't good, as some wild Spearows attack them.""POKEMON EMERGENCY""-Ash manages to get Pikachu to Viridian City (via Misty's bike last eps.) and the first Pokemon Center (via Officer Jenny's motorcycle) when Meowth, Jessie, and James (not in the game) distract him to steal the Pokemon there.""ASH CATCHES A POKEMON""-Ash, Pikachu, and Misty are marooned in the Viridian Forest, where Ash captures a Caterpie, and a Pidgeotto. Now you don't expect Team Rocket to give up easily, and their first battle begins."
4,My fave Pokemon is Jigglypuff.,"I like Pokemon, but i think this doesn't need an award for this episode. It's just not my favorite episode out of all the shows."
4,the Big Why,"The Big Why:We had hoped that the book would have more history about Brigus, Newfoundland where my husband was born. Sadly it didn't however the stories were a treat. Reading books is always a surprise when it comes to their content, only text books have the known product."
5,i got 2!,"this is a very tight,rare,out of print album.i have this one new,sealed,on cassette tape and it features brotha lynch hung.i also have:g 4 life on cassette tape,new,sealed FOR SALE.EMAIL."
4,Unsung Western Hero - Duff,"Another MGM ""Made to order"" United Artists film of late 50's. This is a good one with crystal clear B/W photography and good sounsd. A good plot, if familiar, and average but well acted by that oft used, but seldom praised, Western hero Howard Duff, with stong support from Bill Williams and Lita Baron, with Douglas Fowley (hardly recognisable), Jack Pickard, and wm. Phillips. The action is good and whilst I write as a long standing fan of Westerns of this period and budget, I think most fans will enjoy. If you do know the film and are wondering whether it's worth it - Well - it is expensive, but I say go for it while you can. Recomended to all Western fans of it's type. (Does that make sense? It's just that it's not ""The Magnigicent 7""!!)"
2,Seemed to drag a bit for me,Stopped halfway. Just didn't work for me - seemed a bit shallow / dragging.
3,"Terry, what happened to you?","First, let me be frank. Terry Pratchett is always worth reading, but his Discworld novels after about the fifth (I forget what it's called) have all suffered from the same flaw. That is, uncalled for moralization at really awkward points of the story. Man, you're a humor writer! Kids are not taking their social education from you...I really miss his first five Discworld novels in which there was no such thing happening. Only biting sarcastic humor, and fantasy conventions turned upside down. I without reservation recommend the first five Discworld novels...no preachiness! I know you can never go back, but I miss the old Terry Pratchett...In any case, despite the ridiculous attempts to insert some kind of life lessons, you can count on several laughs in every one of Pratchett's books and this one is no different."
5,First Discworld novel I read and still my favorite,"This novel introduced me to Discworld, and after reading 6 or 7 of them, I still consider this one my favorite. However, I much prefer the original cover art and larger format (from the first paperback printing in the UK)."
4,Enjoyable and imagninative,"I've heard many good comments about Terry Pratchett's work, from many different people, but somehow never managed to pick up any of his books until now. Having finished this one, I can't say that I disagree with any of what I've heard. Pratchett has created a highly imaginative world, one where the rules, while different from the ones we're accustomed to, have their own logic. There is also lots of humor in his work, and I often found myself giggling, or even laughing right out loud.This is, perhaps, one of the most inventive conceptions of time I've ever come across. The quasi-quantum view of time presented here presents an abundance of opportunities for confusion and paradox, but it provides a wonderful framework to hang the story on. And what a story it is, full of surprises and interesting twists, all drawing the reader towards a fairly satisfying ending. This was a thoroughly entertaining book, and I look forward to reading more of Pratchett's work."
5,Prepare for a serious mental workout,"All time-travel stories require the suspension of disbelief. This one is like those dreams where you jump into the air & suspend your body as well. Reminds me of Joyce's ""Ulysses,"" in that you really need to start at the end & then read it again from the beginning. And then start over. Nanny Ogg is called upon to serve as a midwife. Some years later, a young man is visited by a woman who turns out to be an Auditor in disguise, & who asks him to build a glass clock that may or may not stop Time. Meanwhile, a novice adopted by the Thieves' Guild is sent to join the History Monks. Death turns up (as you might expect when traveling through time), along with the Death of Rats (""SQUEAK""); Quoth, the Raven; & Susan, Death's granddaughter & the strictest (& best) teacher you ever had. Oh, also meet Wen, the Eternally Surprised. Chocolate is the best weapon against evil, the Apocalypse has a Fifth Horseman, and don't forget Rule One."
4,Yet another great installment,"I was actually a bit nervous going into this book -- was Discworld getting stale? Would Pratchett be able to break out of what I've viewed as a recent slump? The answers, to my relief and delight, are no and yes, in that order. It helps that this is book features Death, who continues to be one of my favorite Discworld characters, but it also helps that it's just very good. Sure, there are some themes that are obvious echoes of previous Discworld books, and the basic plot in outline is not radically dissimilar from, say, Hogfather; but apparently I'm not as fixated on freshness and novelty as I imagined I was. I'll settle for quality."
4,Timeless...,"Pratchett is a god, only not as annoying, stupid, or petty. :) The only thing that held me back in this book is a slightly convoluted story. However, this book is still Discworld-tastic, and it features Nanny Ogg, which is a nice change from the usual focus on Granny. Also, the Sweeper is always great. Funny, fast, and freaky-deaky!"
4,Very Humorous,"Terry Pratchett has pulled another miracle off with the lastest book in the Discworld(TM) Series! This was a wonderful book. This book unlike other books in the Discworld series talks about different charcters than the usual Ankh-Morpork Watchers. Also it steps bravely into the ranks of Douglas Adams and others who make an effort to keep their readers awake with strange and twisted (but humourous) ideas of the universe. This book focuses on the the Time. If you have ever been wondering if there will was a yesterday and if there will be a yesterday, read this book.My only complaint is that sometimes the plot gets too confusing to follow when Pratchett puts to many of his wacky ideas in one paragraph."
3,"In the interest of time, a brief review","To sum it all up, a clock made entirely of glass has never worked before. Until now. A mad genius is certain he has it figured out, to the detriment of humanity. The possible consequence is that time itself will tear the fabric of human reality apart, and so a large cast of characters get involved to sort it all out. They include witches and incarnations, and history monks. The writing is clever, and there are plenty of cool images conveyed with Pratchett's creative writing. The story itself got a little too crowded with events for me, and following developments became difficult after about half the book. Characters are also quite creative, but development is sparse, which lessened the enjoyment for me a bit. I'm not an expert on Pratchett books. I've read a few, and this one was okay. The others I've read were better, and I enjoyed them more. But I would recommend this one. It certainly is entertaining enough to satisfy a lot of readers."
2,Underwhelming visit to Pratchett's Discworld,"I'm not giving this a lukewarm review because it's shabby or poorly written or otherwise sub-par, only because it simply didn't turn out to be my taste. ""Thief of Time"" consists of vignette after vignette and conversation after conversation on the nature of time, humanity, and the absurdities of life, all done with a humorous Monty Python-esque and Douglas Adams-ish bent. Individual scenes are somewhat amusing (I like Monty Python and Douglas Adams) but the whole thing sort of meanders and spins its wheels. I like momentum and story and progression, even with humorous satires, and this just sort of lost me time and again (no pun intended). But, as stated, strong fans of offbeat humor and satire may like this more than I did. I hear a lot of good things about Terry Pratchett, so I'll probably eventually try another of his ""Discworld"" titles (apparently it doesn't matter where you start). But I think I'll take a break for a while."
5,EXTREMELY PLEASED,SHARE MY LONESOME VALLEY: THE SLOW GRIEF OF LONG-TERM CARE IS AN EXCELLENT GUIDE FOR ALL CARETAKERS.THE BOOK WAS RECEIVED PROMPTLY AND IN GOOD CONDITION.THANK YOU.
4,"Interesting reading, thoughtful insights","Easy to read in a colloquial, flowing style the narrative presents overwhelming concepts in a pattern thoughtful and clear. It's helpful to see how the authors support each observation with research, data and case studies. The book is presented in such a way that it can address a broad audience both in age and stage of life. If you do buy this book however, please keep in mind that relationships do not have to be ""all ebb-flow-all oceans come an end"" which is what the authors suggest."
4,A nice used find,I ordered this book after taking a course on watercolor quilts. I wanted to order this book after purusing a fellow quilter's copy of it. I was able to find it inexpensively as good used and bought it online. I received it in a timely manner and will utilize it in the near future. Thanks!
4,lRI ON HER OWN?! Sounds good,"The beautiful Lori Angel finally gets her on book- and it is fantastic. Like all the other books by AJ butcher, this deserves five stars easily- six stars if I could!"
2,Study the Roots,"As someone who has studied sociology Feagin should know that the roots of racism predate the 14th century. Racism is a part of the human condition, in fact, Black Americans who state that people of color cant be racist, are, in actuality, planting the seed of racist thought. Feagin does not seem to understand that white's from Kant to Jefferson were actively questioning why certain races of people where seemingly culturally advanced and why others seemed to be stunted. Throughout history people have made war or dealt in other ways with different culturers, comparison naturally begins (race being a factor of many such comparisons)..example: in the 12th century Arab traders in the South of Africa noted that the inhabitants were dirty, drank to much and behaved in a lewd manner to their own women. Rightfully or not those traders formed a comparative opinion; much of what we now call racism is just that!"
1,terrible racist ranting...,"by feagin, super-racist. it never ceases to amaze me that when a black racist writes or speaks on his/her crazed views there is always some hippie (see guilty white suburban dwellers) publisher/station willing to give that person an outlet for their hate diatribe. skip this, try auto of malcolm x or dr. king instead. and for all you haters out there, i'm also black.ask yourself, who elected these clowns as the black 'leadership'""al sharpton: racist, does it for the attentionjesse jackson: 'reverend' who paid millions to hush up his secret lover, loves to yell 'racist' at anyone (companies, etc.) so that they will pay him money to go awayfarrakhan: super hate-monger, rivals bin-laden, insanereal black role models in a perfect world:condoleeza rice: beautiful intelligent black woman who also happens to run this countrycolin powell: honored military veteran (a real hero), a real man, should have run for president (he would have won), also runs this country"
4,A definate must read,I've read most the books on martial arts and this is the most extensive coverage of materials I've ever read. It's a must read for anybody interested in the martial arts.
4,Pepper Mill,"Works ok, but seems a little pricey for what you are getting. Guess you have to pay to own a Peugeot."
4,Strange yet cool!,"A very odd novel, TOMH accelerates at strangely fast speeds at the beginning, slowing to a crawl in the middle before revving up to the downbeat ending.If you're a time travel/sci fi bod this book will disappoint, the novel is really about unquestioning lust/love for a woman.The main character is also a strangely calm person considering the absurd situations he finds himself in. He's an idealized person really, without any faults. He also describes how good/plain/whatever each and every meal is.But if you want to realise just how absurd Ronald Reagan's presidency was, and that a better world was lost when Carter failed to be re-elected, then read here.The photos however, do not really add much to the plot and are few and far between."
5,Unbelieveable!!!!!!!!!,"Peter could build the tension so vivid, but at teh same time he can turn it into laughter. This book makes me wonder wheter time travel is possible or not, but the most prominent thing is wheter it is a worth-trying travel. Never heard of Peter's name, he is absolutely not as famous as Ernest hemingway, Shidney Sheldon, etc, but He has the thing that makes him different and stunning."
4,"Time and Again, or maybe not","This book reminds me irresistably of Jack Finney's _Time_and_Again_, and yet it is completely different. For the first three-quarters of the book, it is a stylish, tightly-woven narrative with believable characters and plausible (if unpredictable) plot twists. Then in the last quarter, it falls apart into a more self-indulgent narrative. I'm hoping for a sequel, since the book seemed fundamentally unfinished.I'd give it five stars if it ended as well as it began."
4,Witty and entertaining,"I thought this was an excellent book, just short of perfect actually. There are a number of plot twists and they were all appreciated. The theory of time travel seems to have a few loose ends, but I think that was intended - it makes you think about it. The ending seemed perfectly suited toward there being a sequel, which I hope we see. Be warned that the reason the protagonist travels back in time is to prevent Reagan from becoming President, so if your politics lean to the right you may not enjoy Delacorte's political viewpoint. For me, the politics were right on."
2,confused political polemic disguised as time travel,"I'm a fan of time travel from way back. Finney's novels, Matheson's Bid Time Return, Allen Appel's books, and others. Time on My Hands starts well, but bludgeons you with anti-Reagan propaganda. I'm not the former president's biggest supporter, but I thought Forrest Gump had wandered into the plot. The time travel aspects are really confused, as Delacorte's understanding of time travel has several holes in logic. The ending is a complete cop-out, almost as if he had to meet a deadline. Its questions on the hazards of time travel affecting one's existence aren't well-thought out at all. You'd be better off re-reading Time and Again, or something like Ken Grimwood's Replay, Darryl Brock's If I Never Get Back, or even Kinsella's Shoeless Joe, which has elements of time travel. But skip this one and travel to anything else."
2,time on my hands,"This was light entertainment that ultimately disappointed. Borrowing heavily from Replay, Back to the Future, and Jack Finney (old photos to lend credibility) this comes across as the plot of a Quantum Leap episode. However, the highly negative opinions expressed about a highly regarded American are too heavily handed and the main character has some glaring character flaws that are too easily glossed over. I missed the bantering between Sam and Al. Needs a sequel to remedy the letdown of not even a hint of a solution. If you want to devise your own alternative endings then write your own story! Again, ok for an afternoon on the veranda but I preferred the Delorean over the boat. Keep trying Peter, Matheson and Finney are hard to match."
2,time travel lover,"I enjoyed the basic story in this book however Mr. Delacorte needs to get over his Reagan hatred or at least subdue it a smidge!Sheesh, the repeated cheap shots and Reagan-ranting came close to ruining an otherwise good book. If you don't mind wading through the author's personal hangups then you'll probably enjoy the book.The end of the book was like hitting a wall. I thought someone had torn a few pages out of my book. The ""leave 'em wanting more"" theory was a little abrupt here."
4,GREAT BOOK--BAD ENDING,"I realize that this book is the first of a series but, oh boy, the ending left me hanging. I agree with the other reviewers who liked the writing, the historical descriptions (terrific) and the character development. They were great! But I'm still hanging around waiting for book 2."
3,Too Much Fluff,"This was a 300-page novel that was 400 pages long. I mean, there was so much fluff that I often found myself skipping pages because, paragraph after paragraph, nothing was happening. With a good bit of editing, this could have been a very good read. Sorry to have such a minority opinion, but that's the way I see it."
3,"Good, but if you already have mark of the mole series...","...then this isn't really too necessary, unless you are a big residents fan. It's basically tracks from the first two mole albums that are played live and also a live version of ""satisfaction"" and Penn Jillete as a narrator."
4,"Yes, it IS the novel of the movie!","The movie that traumatized countless young Christians in the 1970's IS indeed in book form! I read this years ago & am glad to see some copies floating around to add to my collection. If you have never seen the film series, imagine Left Behind with no stars & a shoestring budget, but with raw energy & a gutload of dedication. These aren't people who made movies for the money but because they by-God-believed in the message!ooo===ooo"
5,The cup is half full.,"I was telling my sister-in-law about a friend's child who just started a new school and is having a hard time. My sister-in-law knew about this book and suggested I get it for my friend. She loved it! After she read it to her son, it opened up a whole discussion on what would be the same and different at his new school, and how the differences don't have to be bad. He really responded well. I read it, too, and I have to say, after just starting a new job, I found myself laughing at how appropriate this children's book is to my life. You may miss friends and things from the past, but you can learn a lot from new experiences. Ms. Miller's students are lucky to have her as a teacher."
5,Complete original,"I enjoy what the other reviewers have wrote about this great album.People were distracted from Kirk's real talent (because he plays 3 horns at one time, and was blind and charasmatic). Try listening to the song ""The Inflated Tear"". This song encompasses the strength, delicateness, and creativity of his playing. And, I wonder how such a song could have been concieved. There is no other album like this one. I hope you try it.Also...I've read that this album was on Ken Keasy and the Merry Prankster's bus. Of course, the guys in the Grateful Dead must have heard it. It sounds to me that ""Sage and Spirit"", from the Deads 1974 album, ""Blues for Allah"" sounds like it might have come from an appreciation of the song ""Fingers in the Wind"" from ""The Inflated Tear"". Maybe?"
4,Very good first book in a series,"I've been anxiously waiting to begin the Dalziel and Pascoe series, and was very happy to begin with this first book in this long-lived series. I am anticipating a a wonderful time while I read all the other books. Hill is a remarkable writer, and his two characters - Dalziel and Pascoe are as real as they can get. I am a huge fan of the british police procedural genre, and this series looks to be a winner. In this book we are introduced to the wonderful world of English Rugby, as well as the plots and counterplots afoot in the English Rugby Country Club culture. This is a very readable book."
3,Interesting first book,"I remember liking the television show based on this series a lot and thought I'd check out the books. It's not a bad book, just not a terribly compelling one. I felt like there wasn't enough with the main characters and all of the actual suspects weren't terribly interesting save for the dowdy neighbors across the street. I'll probably read a few more in the series just to see how the Dalziel and Pascoe develop."
4,Enjoyable from start to finish,"A rugby player is knocked on his head during his game and goes home to an uncommunicative wife. After passing out on his bed for five hours, he comes downstairs to find the wife dead. Enter Detective Superintendent Andrew Dalziel who knows all the players and Sergeant Peter Pascoe, whose loyalties lie with another code.Strong writing, strong story line. Truly fun to read."
4,Reginald Hill's first and still enjoyable,"Though written in 1970, this first book by Hill (with an interesting foreward by the author), has some terrific dialogue and character setups that will eventually become the hallmarks of his writing. ""A Clubbable Woman"" is the first outing for the Dalziel and Pascoe detective partnership and the contrasting personalities work well even at this early stage. Hill's foreward explains his thinking in creating the polar-opposite characters.""A Clubbable Woman"" is slightly sexist in its treatment of women, but otherwise presents an entertaining complex story line that is ultimately plausible and satisifying.This book also signals the welcome arrival of numerous reprints of Hill's earlier novels, which provide the U.S. mystery reader with many new possibilities to absorb time and money."
2,Problematic,Made of cheap plastic. Handle does not remain screwed into head. Should have gone to big box store & bought a metal one w/handle that works. This one waste of money.
5,Jazz Classic,"I've owned the 33 and the CD and this record is a great one. DOug & Jean where married then and this music was reflective of what was known then as the black power movement.Whatever the political time, this is timeless music and a wonderful addition to any jazz lovers collection"
5,What jazz needs,"In the 1960's there began what can only be described as a spiritual revolution among jazz musicians. Spearheaded by the likes of Coltrane, Yusef Lateef, Pharoah Saunders, etc. jazz became a means for social change and a vehicle for spiritual elightenment.""Revelation"" by Doug Carn was a lost masterpiece of this era. Apart from the top rate songwriting and musicianship, this recording demonstrates and evokes in the listener a joy and an elevation of the spirit and heart that is sadly lacking on most music.Jazz musicians and audiences would do well to remember that this music means a triumph of the spirit and dignity of the human being over opression and despair. This cannot be accomplished by that trumpet player whose docility is being exploited by that large classical music venue in New York City; or the hoards of bebop nazis who think that the development of jazz ended in 1964."
4,Masters of their craft,The Doug Carns group is phenomenal they represent black jazz at its highest. Excellent Representation By a jazz group with depth and range
2,Received broken teacups,"2 of the cups were broken when package opened. Not enough packaging material to insulate the cups from the delivery person just ""dropping"" it off at the door. Disappointed."
3,Lots of good pictures - short on biography,"It's great to have a nice collection of St. John's drawings in print, but I was hoping that the book would contain more biographical material. Two pages of an introduction in fairly large print, plus a photo, is all that we get."
5,Exactly what I expected,"A very handy tool for the garage. Quality is great, and it is made with heavy duty construction. Am sure I will use it for many years."
1,No need or audience for this one.,"I would not consider assigning or recommending this title to my students who are going to read Iliad IX in Greek. The late Malcolm Willcock's commentary on Books I-XII (ISBN 185399507X) costs only three dollars more, is certainly the equal of this one in critical acumen and literary appreciation, and is more helpful on the Greek. (And of course, it also covers books 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, and 12.) Griffin is aware of Willcock's work, which he rightly describes as ""unpretentious and helpful"" (p. 47). He has not produced new material that will require students or scholars to notice his little book."
4,Very Useful,I use this nutmeg grater all the time. The only thing I wish was different is that it is too hard for me to open the top to put in another nutmeg. I just can't get a good grip on it. I have to ask my husband to open it for me.
4,Great gift.,I bought one of these in France and like it so much that I bought 2 for Christmas gifts when I got home. For being acrylic it is solid and does a great job. I'm only satisfies with freshly shaved nutmeg now.
5,This is a good release,"I have this performance in the 1980's London Stereo Treasury LP release and in Japan in 1990 missed the only CD release I saw until recently. The Pierre Monteux Sibelius 2nd is worth waiting for and on reading reviews on Amazon ordered from Anteater records. It sounds like SACD cd's by conductor Fritz Reiner, also originally recorded by RCA at the end of the 50's that sound like perfection itself and this is in that class."
3,Informative yet time consuming and expensive,"I picked up this book after quitting smoking to go through a whole body detox and found a lot of the information useful and compelling. At the same time, it is very difficult and down-right complicated to work full time and follow the daily tea drinking at special times, exercise, bathing rituals, and lengthy food preparation, etc. I found I had to pick 2 or 3 items out of the schedule for a day but never managed to fit in everything recommended except almost everything on a weekend. Silver provides an extensive shopping list with some hard to find and many(!) expensive items although she does state several times that you should adapt the plan to whatever works for you. I am glad I bought the book as I learned many things about digestion, nutrition and overall health and have adopted some of the recommendations but definitely have not been able to go through the full plan."
1,cheap toy,"This toy is made of cheap thin plastic and the string to affix it to your child's arm broke the same day we got it. If you could buy this toy in a dollar store, it would be fine. That is about all it is worth. Don't waste your money"
2,Ouch,"I'm sorry - I love PW as much as anyone out there, but aside from a few good tracks (My Dad, Lookin' out in Heaven, As Far As I Know, Gun Shy), this album is really quite atrocious.Poor writing ($100 Groom), unfunny/lame jokes (Jingle), and painfully poor vocals (Breathe Some New Life) just kill this album... that last song really makes me cringe.It may have been recorded in the same manner as Stereo/Mono, Come Feel Me Tremble & Dean Man Shake - but this one is lacking in both material and (from what I can tell) interest on Paul's part.Hardly ""the bomb"" we were all anticipating."
2,Beware of Re-Hashing,"I have been a Paul Westerberg/Replacements fan going on 16 years. I have followed Paul's solo career, and have all of his CD's. On this album, it appears that Paul really, really needs to start working with a producer again. There are a couple of gems on this one, notably ""Folker,"" and ""My Dad."" However, it seems that Paul is re-hashing some of his earlier solo material. I never thought I would say that about Paul's solo career, but alas, there it is. If you like Paul's solo outings, I reccommend the Grandpaboy release ""Mono."""
1,What a long way down,"Oh my, in pains me to have to say that this album is awful. I've loved Paul and The Replacements so long, how painful. Was he drunk while recording this? Where's the good songwriting we've come to expect. Only a very few highlights. Sad."
1,Ho hum,"The problem with this CD is not the production--thankfully, Paul is no Peter Gabriel--it's the songs. If you were to compile a list of Paul's 50 best songs, none of these would be on it.Save your money for the tour or spend it on the new Tommy Stinson."
4,still on a roll...,"although not quite as strong as stereo/mono OR come feel me tremble, it's still astounding how much strong material westerberg has been producing from the basement the last three years OR so...folker is a bit poppier and tighter than his other recent efforts. ""lookin up in heaven"" and ""as far as i know"" have infectious, beatlesesque hooks. ""now i wonder"" and ""my dad"" are equally solid, if a tad bit loose. and ""how can you like him?"" is one of the coolest tracks paul's offered in years.all i know is, as long as westerberg's on a roll, keep the tape recorder running..."
3,"Could be a Cult,Or Commune of Baddies.","There is a charismatic personality who comes off kind of like `Stuntman Mike' from DEATH PROOF.This seducer-of-minds entertains the trio of co-workers into going to some place better than the bar they work at ( It's no MERLOTTES from `True Blood' ).It was wild to see the changing personalities of characters,Which is a compliment to their acting skills.There is some extreme violence, And some surprises at end.You may be fascinated to know the FERAL couple is almost more sane then the DOMESTICATED couple of sadists.One performer of note,DAVID C. HAYES, Is an Arizona Film Icon and also made the trip in 2002 to be a victim in DEADLY SCAVENGERS.Another performer,AARON GINN-FORSBERG,Is very charismatic and has been cast in the internet cult hit - WESTERN X !"
5,The best cookbook in the collection!,"I am an avid fan of JoAnna Lund - I have every one of her cookbooks - but this one outweighs them all. My husband is a very picky eater, and he loves the recipes from this book. They are easy to make, delicious to eat, and will become a family favorite! I highly recommend this book - you won't be sorry!"
3,"Desserts are good, but rest is average","After trying several recipes, I am a bit disappointed in this book. Joanna uses tomato sauce or tomato soup in almost every recipe - even the beef stroganoff used tomato soup and while it wasn't awful, it was as strange as it sounds. And why would anyone use canned peas &/or mushrooms when fresh ones are readily available and taste MUCH better (not to mention they are more nutritious). I found most of the recipes filling but very bland - healthy food doesn't have to be like this.The desserts are good, though - it may be worth the money for those alone."
4,BC898T scanner,Not a bad scanner for the money. Easy to program. Still need lots to learn on how to use the trunking mode and other feactures. I highly recommend buying the frequency channells for your area. Radio Shack has stop selling the national frequency book but you can still find them on the net. Over all it's a good scanner.
5,Family Fun is Fabulous,"I can't recommend this book highly enough. I have three young children who look forward to paging through it before every birthday to choose the cake they want--and, luckily for me, all are incredibly easy to make. We've used it for ideas for bake sales, everyday celebrations, school parties, and even a terrific sandpail cake that has become a staple for us when we entertain guests at the beach. You cannot go wrong with this book!"
2,Lots of Party themes but a little outdated.,"I was disappointed in this book because I love Family Fun Magazine. It was more for the mom who is looking for an easy birthday theme and doesn't know where to start. Great for the younger years when the kids really don't care how elaborate the party is but by age 7 I think the ideas in this book would just be too basic. You can find most of these themes in any party store so I think it is outdated since parties have become an ""event"" nowadays."
2,Beg to Differ,"Future film director Bergman has an interesting idea here but completely fumbles it as New York dick Jack LeVine travels east to help an old friend and stumbles onto the beginnings of the Blacklist. Great idea, but LeVine's smug, ""believably hard-boiled"" narration is incredibly lame-o. The Hollywood characters are reasonably well-done, but LeVine is never believable, just ridiculous. Try to imagine ""The Sun Also Rises"" being narrated by a private eye. Then move on to some other book!"
3,TRICK OR TREAT,"I guess this is supposed to be a Halloween collection. Like, what you play when the kids come around for candy so they can hear it. Because when you open the door, they'll hear it and be freaked. Especially if you play Frankenstien or the Addams famly theme. Fairly good at that level then."
5,Brooks Law for the schedule impaired,"With the other two books in this series, James does an excellent job of conveying many of the lessons of large software project management and software design in a series of short, accessible anecdotes which can be easily digested by someone who is just coming to the field, or who doesn't have the time and focus to really digest Brooks (""The Mythical Man-month"") or Demarco/Lister (""Peopleware""). This set is concise and to-the-point, and a must have for the new project manager or project lead."
4,Smooth grinding,"This grinder is a great improvement from our last one, which had a spring loaded cover that was very difficult to secure so it kept popping off. This cover also has the same tendency to torque when grinding, but does tighten down much better than our last grinder.The grinding mechanism is very smooth."
1,if i could rate this zero stars i would.,"I am a huge zombie flick fan. in fact, i prefer low budget horror movies over most genres. i was really really excited to watch this movie despite what other reviewers had written. i am like other fans of the genre: give every movie no matter how low budget a chance. this was a mistake. the footage was horribly shot and the acting was horrible and the ancient looking zombies looked like trash. i wanna see fans killing people, not just red liquid splattering on the floor. give me gore. gore isnt just cheap fake blood running down the tiles of a floor, its ripping flesh apart, its decapitation, its not Flesh Freaks. Believe me DO NOT buy this movie. find someone who was stupid enough to buy it and try to watch it. i couldnt even get through the whole movie. that is absurd. the only other movie i couldnt make it all the way through was that David Spade movie ""Dickie Roberts."" horrible horrible horrible movie."
2,Goofy Zombies and a build up that goes nowhere,"There was no flesh tearing whatsoever in this film. The only action we see is broom sticks being shoved in the zombie's eyes as they groan to death. There are no guts, although we see a fake heart--very lame since we don't actually see it being pulled out. The ending is too easy and opens it self up for a sequal--and I'm positve they won't make another one because this film isn't worth .... Even fans of the genre, like myself, won't find themselves too excited with this one."
1,I'm sorry but this was garbage!,"Usually I'm very understanding when it comes to low-budget movies. Movies that people slam I find something good about, especially if it's a zombie movie. But this movie was just plain bad, bad, bad. It has a good premise but goes nowhere. If you like no-budget zombie flicks, get ""Meat Market"" instead of ""Flesh Freaks,"" it's way better. Trust me, unless you were in this movie, you won't want to waste your time and money watching it."
1,Next time I'll just flush my money down the drain!,"I was soooo ashamed to call a buddy over to watch this. It looked really cool, but I'm afraid even the most hardened B-movie veteran would have to say uncle to it. I'm usually quite tolerant of low-budge movie making, but this one was over-hyped and over-priced. A small handful of ok gore shots was the only saving grace to this otherwise bad movie. Heed my warning!!!"
4,A good challenging adventure,"One of the better adventures to come around, Crypt of Lyzandred the Mad is a fun time for a gaming group. Sean K. Reynolds has produced all quality work so far, lets hope he keeps his pattern going."
1,NEVER BOUGHT THIS,"I have never ordered this product so I can't comment on it, not sure why I am asked to rate this item."
1,Disappointing!,"The Wind Singer by William Nicholson was an unexecptional fantasy, parts of which were downright banal. As the author is an experienced screen writer, one would expect more freshness in plot and dialog. Instead, parts of it read as if it were written by the 7-10 age group, instead of written for them.The book started with promise, but became mired in cliches, well-known plot devices and too many unbelievable things--too many even for a fantasy. It is the first of a trilogy, but I have no intention of reading the rest. If you are looking for fresh, interesting children's fantasy, stick to Harry Potter or give The Thief Lord a try."
4,Great start to the series,I thought this book was brilliant however it is worst than the next two in the series. It has a good use of characters and a great plot.
2,I liked some of it...,"I think I liked this book until I got about halfway through. Then things started to go downhill. Without giving too much away for people who might want to read it, some of the story elements seemed corny, and parts of the ending are hackneyed and contrived. I had such high hopes for this book (and the next ones in the series), but it left a bad taste in my mouth. I don't think I'll be reading the next one... if I do, it'll have to be awfully good to hold my interest through another 300 pages!"
3,The Wind SInger,"Though this was a very original story, the setting was a little too weird for me. Certain things made no sense, like where did that city get it's food supplies if no one goes outside it? I guess I shouldn't ask such questions of a childrens', book, but other ya novels actually have feasable agricultural practices. And I felt like the feisty heroine was a little too feisty, like the author tried way too hard to make her a spitfire heroine. And the villains were creepy, no doubt about that, but this is a case where if you go too outside the lines of genre formulas, you lose your intended audience (like me)"
5,A gripping story!,"This was an amazing book! a lot of books take a while to get started, but this 1 didn't. It grabbed you in in the first couple of pages. this is a story about 2 twins and a tag-along classmate who set off to find the voice of the wind singer, which will protect their city from the zars and make it a better place. along the way they encounter a lot of strange things, so the excitement never stops! Once you pick this book up, you wont be able to put it down!"
5,Great Book,"My ten year old had just started to read it, and he is already half way through. He said it is really interesting. We got him book two and three also. So he can't wait to read all of them. He also said that it is weired so far, but nice and keeps him want to know more."
5,Wow,this book was by far the 3rd best book i had ever read. that is only because the second and thurd book in the wind on fire series are even better! it is a must read for all ages.
3,"Okay, but nothing special!","This book has a very original concept (a world depending on tests), and some very nice morals (the love between siblings, the terror of racism, the power of love and friendship, the will to fight for a certain goal). Being a screenwriter, William Nicholson knows how to omit any dull parts and how to create characters that capture one's attention and make the reader identify with them.The Zars (an army of villiains) are indeed creepy, but they are not enough of a villiain. As for the Morah, it (?) only appears in one scene.Even though the book is entertaining, it lacks suspense, adventure and... well, it does not have the vivid colors or magic of Harry Potter and other such books.However, the plot develops nicely and quickly, and overally it is a good read, but doesn't have any huge impact on the reader."
3,A little too young,"I didn't enjoy this book a whole lot. There were many different let downs for me. However book two and three in this series are amazing! I reccomend this series because of the greatness of book two and three. The main characters are much older. I . . . the next two booke, where they are under ten in this one. I highly reccomend this series. Getting through this mediocre book is worth it, to get to books two and three."
5,MOLTO BELLO E PARTICOLARE,"BENE,è VERAMENTE UN OROLOGIO DA COLLEZIONE.POSSIEDO DIVERSI INVICTA,QUESTO è SENZA DUBBIO UNO DEI PIU' BELLI ED IL SUO COSTO ,A PARTE QUELLO DI SPEDIZIONE E QUELLO DDI DOGANA ALTO,è ABBASTANZA CONVENIENTE."
3,AP Statistics: Preparing for the Advanced Placement Examination (AMSCO),I had trouble locating a new copy of this AP prep book for my daughter. The one I received was in pretty good condition although I'm not sure if it was the edition she needed.
1,DOA,"It was dead on arrival.The light was working; but unfortunately it wasn't suitable to do duty as a halfway competent flashlight.Mockingly the alarm test was working; you could listen all you want to how it would have sounded, if only it worked. But it never did.It was too light and flimsy to work even as a paperweight.Oh, well!Into the trash it went!"
3,Disappointing Most of it,"I have dozens of MFC and VC++ books and have always been buying Unleashed for different topics, this is the first time that the unleashed series has published a book without much regard to the sensetivity of the topics it covered. at certain areas the book is too breif e.g. dialgobar, ctrlbars, rebars wont tell you what to do and how to work with them, on the other hand the book does have some articals which are hard to find elsewhere. Most of the time i referr it i get disappointed. Probably the author(s) tried to collect a lots of articals while keeping the number of pages low and that made them skip so much of the necessary detail, i will not say that it is for advance user it is breif in certain areas and thats all."
2,Beginners Beware!,"If you are new to MFC, like I was, stay away from this book. It is completely useless for a beginner since I doesnt really cover the basics. Reading it will just confuse you. A few of the chapters can be helpful once you become an expert, but it's not worth the money."
1,hmm printing the MSDN is a choice...,"I bought this book for having an advanced MFC reference since I had already a good experience in MFC programming (since VC 4.0). I found this book hard as a reference, it hasn't answered most of the daily questions I have had in everyday MFC programming i.e. lacks the detailed explanation of how the MFC framework works not to tell some deeper concepts I expected it to decently explain like MFC sockets and multi-thread programming.The author shows to have read and reproduced faithfully the MSDN online *free* help instead of teaching and sharing with the readers his knowledge and experience. I do not recommend this book, after all the online MSDN is free."
1,A MSDN for beginners.,"The book is full of definitions. It seems not to be for Intermediate to Advanced. Tell me if the text below from the book is for intermediate or for dummies: ToolTips are small, yellow text windows that appear over certain dialog controls after after the mouse pointer stops for a moment(:(. The button control is an information request control(:(. So on for every control (all the Chapter 2). (Chapter 4) Text is very important to users of computer programs,... A bitmap is an array of bits that form an image of some kind. And so on and on and on .... Keep your money for a good lunch instead."
3,Pretty good,Did not have temperature. Other than that seems good. I use it for time and speed mostly. Has lasted longer than my last one.
1,It Came Off My Bike!,"It worked great, until I was in the Danskin's Women's Triathlon and hit a grate in the road and it flew off! As I was in the middle of the race with women all around me I was not about to stop for it. So if you plan on never hitting a bump, it works ok."
1,Planet Bike Protege' 8.0,This computer did not work from the start and I had to return it. I decided to buy a Sigma instead. The sigma was much easier to install. And I was up and running in 30 minutes.
5,This has it all!,This computer has everything I need. I like it because you can easily switch between screens by pushing up on it. It's easy to understand and to see when I'm on my bike. This is a great computer for the value.As of 12/20/2010 this comp is still working great and I have it on my beater bike that sits out in most weather. This computer is durable in all weather and temp.
4,Planet Bike Protoge 8.0,"This bike computer has worked out great for me. Installation took only a few minutes. One installation note is that the sensor mounts to the front fork, but not directly facing the spokes. On my bike, it is angled back about 45 degrees towards the spokes, which places it the correct distance from the magnet. I used a little blue locktite to secure the magnet. Initial setup of the wheel size, etc., takes a little patience, but I was riding within a few minutes. Now that the weather's getting colder, I'm thinking I should have considered the 9.0 model with the temperature sensor, but I'm very happy with this one. It's a great feature that it slips out of it's holder and can be stored inside out of the weather."
2,I'm buying a different computer,"This computer is really cool in that the display is good and it tells you all kinds of data. However, if you hit a solid bump in the road it falls off! Mine fell off going down a hill at 25mph and it took me 15 minutes to find it. To my surprise it still worked. A couple days later I hit another bump going 30mph and it fell off in such a dangerous traffic situation I just kept going. I'm done with this computer."
4,Not perfect,I have had this bike computer for over a year. My only complaint has to do with the bracket that mounts on the handlebar. The unit falls out too easily. I nearly lost it a few times. I have epoxied a paperclip to the computer and connected a cord from that clip to the bike. When the computer comes out it now is prevented from falling to the ground by the cord. The computer at times will move within the bracket thereby disconnecting from the contacts in the bracket.
1,Very disappointing,This fourth book by the author is very disappointing. Is a re-hash of the older books with no new jars featured. The newer manufacturers are completely ignored. The jars featured in this book have already been featured in the other 3 books. Price values seem low and anemic.
5,Great info on cookie jars,"This book has beautiful color pictures of the cookie jars that it lists. It is an easy to use book, that lists the cookie jars under the makers. If you do not know the maker, it is not so big you can't look thru the book. It does not have every cookie jar in it, but is a very complete book. It gives good values. It is a very easy read if you are just starting to collect, but is complete enough for the seasoned collector to use. It's more user friendly than a regular antique book. I would highly recommend this book as a great reference for collecting."
4,Ultimate Cookie Jar book??????,"It's hardcover. It's an ok book. I know it can't possible carry EVERY cookie jar, but it did not have several of mine."
3,Didn't help me much,"I only wanted the book to identify and price an old cookie jar I have, so I really can't give much of a review, but I was dissapointed that the book didn't have more info (only the price) on my cookie jar."
5,great purchase,"It's an excellent book for students who have had some difficulty with economics' courses. Both style and illustrations make it an easily read one. Indeed, it's a book whose main ideas you will be able to understand even without an instructor."
3,Traditional Italian Cooking (?),"It was OK, though my wife and I are more used to the ""Americanized"" versions of some of these dishes. Maybe we just don't know what real Italian cuisine is. For intermediate to advanced chefs."
4,Beautiful,I saw this on the EWTN Channel one night when I was flipping channels. I couldn't stop watching it. The cinematography is beautiful. I bought the VHS version and then later bought the DVD and I find myself watching this one over and over. The music score is very relaxing.
1,"Dangerous levels of arsenic and cadmium, AVOID!","Consumer Reports found that three daily servings of the ready-to-drink liquid EAS Myoplex Original Rich Dark Chocolate Shake provides an average of 16.9 micrograms (g) of arsenic, exceeding the proposed USP limit of 15 g per day, and an average of 5.1 g of cadmium, which is just above the USP limit of 5 g per day. Concentrations in most products were relatively low, but when taking into account the large serving size suggested, the number of micrograms per day for a few of the products was high compared with most others tested.[...]"
4,Dreamin'...living in a world of Dreams !!,"What a way of life for Victoria !!! Can you imagine dreaming your life away ? Think of this , having to dream just to cope with your marriage ! A marriage that is already over and you dreaming to escape the reality of a failed marriage ! Victoria lived and dreamed three lives. Victoria lived the life of two dreams . One was the life with James and the other one with a rock star named Michael each completely different. Then live the reality of a failed marriaged to Gerald ! I was so glad to see her do away with the dreams and take control of her life ! The dreams where dreams of reality each one seemed so real . She soon learned love is a many splendored thing and ! sometimes you have to make a change !"
5,Outstanding!!!,"I bought this book on impulse without ever reading a single review. I had no idea what I was about to get myself into but I'm extremely glad I chose to buy this book. It's truly a masterpiece. I was completely wrapped up. Not in a long, long time has a book kept me wanting to read non-stop. Darlene you're brilliant girl. Way to go!!"
3,It's okay....,"John Reuben's CD is a decent effort, but I thought he was a Christian artist. I found very little mention of God at all and I can't really see where he is a ""Christian"" artist. Aside those issues, there are some decent songs like ""I John Reu"" and ""Run the night"". Some songs sound kind of old, but they are still solid though... Even though the CD is clean, it's not something that is going to engage you spiritually or anything. If you just like to hear rap without any particular message, you may like to get this, but I'd recommend Grits. They hit you hard spiritually and beats wise."
1,mase03,"i was dissapointed with this album. I had only heard one of JR's songs before and that was do not. I didn't get his first cd because i thought the latest one would be better. I like one or two songs, but I would recommend you should prob. get the first cd. but then again i havent heard that one. I guess I will have to get it and see."
2,Heard better...,"I love John Reuben, he's a great artist. Excellent in concert, and excellent on cd. However, this cd was a complete waste of my money. It seems like there wasn't any real songs on it, just a bunch of interludes and junk.I do highly recommend John Reuben, just not this cd. His first one is my personal favorite ""Are We There Yet?""."
4,When you need to clear your mind & have a good time,"John Reuben's first album, ""Are We There Yet?"" was in the top ten on my list of Favorite CDs of 2000. This is John Reuben's second album, which also is on my list of Favorite CDs of 2002, but this second album didn't make my top ten.This album is a lot of fun and has some interesting sounds, but the lyrics are fluff. His first album had much more in the way of challenging and interesting lyrics. On the other hand, there is a place for fluff--if you've just gotten finished with final exams and papers in school, or have just finished a heavily stressful, hard week of concentrating at work, you may need something with no lyrical depth; you need to just put on something to shake out all that tension from your brain and have a good time. This album is perfect for such times. Definitely party music."
5,Excellent Entree to This Subject,"It's no good complaining that this single work doesn't do ""everything"" that each reader wishes it did. This book provides an excellent introduction to a very complex topic. Interested readers will discover many other sources to expand their knowledge. I did not, as another reader did, find any of the examples that the author discusses to be ""odd"" (indeed, he warns the reader in the first pages of the book that he will be drawing from an eclectic, wide-ranging contextual framework).Eye-opening and written in an interesting style, this book does something that so few books do. First, you'll have more than one ""Aha!"" moment while reading the book. Second, this book will whet your appetite to explore the subject in greater depth."
5,"Excellent music, CD in Great shape!","Excellent music! I have this music on cassette, but was damaged. I am glad I found the CD of this."
2,"Item works, but cord is very short","This DS Car charger works well, but the cord is very short (nothing like the picture.) Our power outlet in the back seat is in the rear of the center console near the floor. My son must sit in the center seat to play his DS if the charger is plugged in (which means I have to move his booster seat over), and it still tends to disconect from the DS if he lifts his DS up too high. Like I said, it charges the DS, but not as conveniently as I'd hoped/assumed."
5,wondeful adaptor,"Ive used this car adaptor for 4, 5 hour trips in the last month alone. It never loses the connection and works perfect. There seemed to be no problem with the item. My sons game system has been charged completely everytime."
3,What I got is not what is pictured.,"The version I got is a coiled up cord, not the straight cord pictured here. Unfortunately the coiled up cord is not very long, so using it while you are playing the DS is impossible."
3,This product is okay.,This is an okay product. The only problem is that the cord is too short if you have kids who are sitting in the back seat and want to charge the DS Lite.
2,beware of trying to save money,"I don't know if we had sometime wrong in the car plug or if the problem is with the charger, but when pluged in the first time it started smoking :( Not a good thing. The charger also didn't have a fuse init or the fuse was blown, so had to put a new fuse in before it could be used the first time.....which didn't go well. I just added this to my order because it was very cheap, but shouldn't have bothered, it went in the garbage three minutes after pluging it in."
1,Wrong Product/Label,"The item requested was a car charger for a Nintendo DS Lite to be used on an extended road trip.The item shipped was a MICRO USB car adapter (clearly marked with a large sticker on the item inside the bag).The bag has the following printed on it: ""GT Max, CELLULAR ACCESSORY, MADE IN CHINA""There is a large sticker on the bag (covering two other stickers) with a bar-code ""X0006EYCLT"" and ""Car Charger for Nintendo DS Lite, Black New""Since we own a couple phones that use the MICRO USB charger I will be keeping the item rather than hassling with a return, but now I will need to purchase a DS car charger locally for an upcoming road trip since I don't have time to get one (cheaper) online."
5,Item as described.,My nephew is extremely pleased that he can now take his game with him anywhere. This item works smoothly.
5,Great car adapter,"I was a little skeptical because of some reviews about this product, but I have to say that it works great, it looks solid and have several connections what makes it very useful. The shipping was super fast."
3,DS Lite charger,this item works as expected. price was right. Now my kids will never run their battery out again on long trips
3,short cord,"My 6 year old son got this as an add on when he ordered a new regular charger for his ds. This one was offered very inexpensively so we got it too. It works fine, but the cord is very short so it doesn't reach to the back seat for him to recharge and play at the same time. Someone in the passenger seat could play and recharge at the same time though. For the price it was worth it."
3,Road tripping savior,"Took a road trip with my son and this little charger saved me the hassle of worrying about him being able to charge. There is a better solution, in a USB charging cable, but this worked as advertised as well."
1,Terrible product,On the first use it over heated to the point that we had to use a towel to unplug it. Do not purchase.
4,good for the money,"Quick to ship. Exactly as described, works great to charge DS or play DS while riding in the car."
5,Can't beat amazons prices,My kids loose these all the time! So rather than go pay $10+ dollars at the store I buy on here for less than a buck. Perfect.
3,Works but...,It never fully charges my son's Nintendo DS but I'm not complaining because I paid cents for it on here.
4,Nice for long car trips,"Charger is nice for long car trips. Helps keep the kids entertained. Works great, no issues, good price, would recommend."
1,Also puzzled by the reviews...,"I was expecting more from this product based on previous reviews, however, this product did nothing to lighten the few dark spots on my skin. It did make my skin feel soft - but any face lotion would do that. I kept using it thinking that eventually I would see the results, but I have now finished the entire bottle & there has been no improvement whatsoever. Don't waste the money or the time."
3,Eh!,Not sure how I feel about this product. Didn't lighten ANY of the spots on my face. I went through TWO bottles but after I finish the one I have I won't buy it anymore.
4,Very good cream.,"I love this product. I don't think that it works as well as Cauladlie's Whitening Serum, but it's a cheaper way to keeep my ivory color going after using a dose of the more expensive brand. This lasts forever! I will definitely keep alternating with my Caudalie. Perfect product!"
1,$32 and the size of a chapstick,"Save your money. This product dries the skin and it's the smallest packaging I've ever seen. They must've used macro photography to get the close-up...the samples are in cellophane packets the size of tea bags (as a matter of fact, they enclose a tea bag.) Rip-off product, try anything else but this..."
2,Nothing special,"I bought this product because I have black spots. I purchased it because of costumer's reviews were very good and because it seas that it is natural. I am using it since more than two weeks, but I don't see any improving signs. So this product is nothing special, I just hope that that the ingredients are natural as it said. And the price is not worthy for it.Komenuka Bijin All-Natural Essence Whitening Cream with Rice Bran - 30ml"
3,Not Quite What I Expected.,"Unless you are into the old time country gospel music this CD is not for you. Not what you would expect from Dolly Parton today. I love Dolly's voice but wish she had a more modern gospel CD that is more of her today style. A little more upbeat! I gave the CD away and the person I gave it to who is a very southern Baptist type, is not even that crazy about it."
5,Unknown Artists get no luck,"I heard ""I Am Not Your Enemy"" on the radio one day and went out right away to find anything on this band. The guitar talent is amazing, and the vocals are electric. This small CD is a must for anyone who has any appreciation for good music."
4,A More Than Adaquate Introduction,"Unlike so many books on the Japanese Colonial Empire which tend to be quite narrow on their focus, this compulation covers the entire empire, formal and informal. Also to its credit, the essays inside are a good mixture of specifically focused and more broadly outlined writings. Overall it is a good buy for any level, from those just beginning to learn colonial history to those much more well versed."
2,Disappointing,"I hate to dis Lefty but this book was definitely a disappointment. First off this book is small and is more of a booklet than a book. Now at a price of $6.95 I might be ok with that but a list price of $16.95 is just insane. The other problem I have with the book is that there really isn't much information about fly fishing for bass. More than half of this little book is spent on the biology of large and smallmouth bass, and the locations and structure you will find them in. If that is what your interested in you can get this information from any of the other numerous books written on this subject. The one chapter on fly selection is ok, but again nothing ground breaking for anyone who is more than a complete novice.I am still waiting for someone to put a decent book together on this subject."
5,Definitly worth reading,"If you are starting out fly fishing for smallmouth bass this book is a must have. The information is very good. The real primary target is smallmouth bass fishing in rivers but there is a lot of good tips and information in general.A person can save a lot of time and expence with the right information, and this book has just that. I read it over and over to try and get all the information possible. If you follow the advise and use the information provided you will improve your fly fishing experance."
2,Not a fan,"I was not a fan of this skimmer. Buyer beware - it does not have a motor in it! It draws water through a bubble siphon. I will say it does work and has been skimming fairly decently for a few months now, but it is slowly starting to fall apart. I can't keep the pegs mounted in the suction cups anymore and the collection cup no longer goes on straight. I have since ordered a different, slightly more expensive skimmer to replace it."
1,expensive waste,I bought this because it had all 5 star rating (all three). I do not know who these people were but for $33 I got a plastic toy with no motor. This does not include a motor. Its just a platic tube with a cup on top with an air tube. That's it. No instuctions either. It doesn't have anything to adjust the air or bubbles. And one of the reviewers wrote that this is better than a Coralife. No way. I paid the Shipping fee to return this useless and over priced toy. If you bought this and really liked it please tell me what kind of pump you attached it to and how much the pump cost.
1,youre joking right?,this thing sucked! I messed with it for a whole week and nothing happened it wasnt even sucking up the water correctly. It ended up falling apart so I threw it out. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME
3,Okay Read....,I'll start off this review by saying I'm not going to give a synopsis when you can find that information in the official description. What I am going to do is give you an honest opinion. This novel was well written and charming. I liked the mystery and romance aspects equally. The romance gained speed gradually and wasn't forced. The mystery started from the get go and there was no stale parts that dragged. I will say that the ending was a surprise and I couldn't get over the fact that some of the details to explain why the guilty party did it while the suspected party did not was a bit contrived. I couldn't believe one of the explanations of why a person did what they did and cast suspicion on hisself. I won't go into specifics to avoid spoiling the read for other. This book is good but could be better at providing a believable ending.
3,ehhh,This book needed a lot o editing. The author wanted to include too many characters to muddle the plot and too much back and forth between the 3 homes plus a better title
4,Good reading,"I enjoyed this book although as another reader pointed out there were a zillion typos throughout the book and some consistency problems. I mean really,...I noticed these mistakes, do they not have a copy editor? But despite these annoying traits, the novel was still pretty good though a bit confusing. I enjoyed the fact that one character reappears at the end who you wouldn't expect to. It was surprising in this way and it was well written enough to enjoy for a nights read. I think the last book I read (the Caretaker) was a much better read however. I may look for more books by Heather Graham despite my complaints. It was entertaining enough"
5,"Tall, Dark, and Deadly",I love Heather Graham. I have read many of her books and have thoroughly enjoyed every one of them. Looking forward to more of them.
4,Great mystery.,Heather Graham does it again. She is a wonderful writer. I enjoy reading her books. She hasn't disapointed me yet.
3,"Tall, Dark, and Deadly",This was a good mystery/suspense; however I could do without the sex; didn't realize at the time that Heather Graham is a romance novelist (my first encounter with Heather Graham and my last).
2,UGH!!!,"If you are looking for suspense, look elsewhere! If you are looking for gushing prose that would do a Harlequin romance novel proud, this is the book for you."
5,Very conducive to a good night sleep,"The sheets are quite comfortable, very soft and light enough to allow for a restful summer slumber."
5,Welcome to Kirsten's World (1854),This is a book about one of the American Girl dolls. There is one for each of the original dolls. They are an excellent source of factual information about that period of history. They even have photos from that particular time in history.
5,A beautiful book!,Very happy with our purchase! This is an excellent book with pictures that detail many aspects of pioneer life. Our daughter loves it!
2,NOW SOUNDS,"Not quite as ""now"" as I thought.. this collection is a bit more retro than expected, but still a kind of mellow Brazil beat that can be enjoyed. ""Electronic""?.. not really..."
3,bless the beast and chlidren review,"I thought the book ""Bless the Beast and Children"" was a little childish. When they bumped I got a little freaked out. What are they that neglected at home? Dogs don't even do that.At the box canyon boy's camp, the boys were expected to sort teams by themselves which wouldn't be very fair. The boys are obviously going to break into groups by size, talent, and how ""tough"" you are. When I found out that they were called the bedwetters I thought it fit them well. Why wouldn't the name fit like three of them actually wet the bed? One of them was even mildly suicidal. Another was hallucinating about ""ooms"" who lived in his sauna. These kids had problems far beyond fixable.The book was hilarious. Reading about their problems, made me think how good I have it. On a one to ten scale, I rate it a 5.5 because it's a little older and it needs to be modernized. To sum it all up, ""Bless the Beast and Children"" was a fairly good book."
1,A stupid book,"The book was very hard to follow it jumps back and forth too much and had very random flashbacks. The point of the book was six kids got dropped off at Box canyon boys camp by there parents who don't care for there kids pretty much going to save buffalo for being brutally murdered. The characters all had some talent that had potential but they didn't follow one another, no team work. There was little symbolism in the book pretty much they had a buffalo head as a trophy that represented first place at the camp. The story took place in Arizona; the point of view was third person and it was best in third because you got to see the misery in all the characters."
3,hmm,"First off I just want to comment on the summary of the book that was in there with all the other reader comments. It is not up there with Outsiders. I read Outsiders for a sixth grade novel study. I absolutely loved it, it is one of the greatest books. I just don't think you ought to be comparing Bless the Beasts and Children with it. It's pretty bad. It's dumb and has no point. But it can pass time, and it's not absolute trash. It's just not my type. Although I quite liked Teft. I think the movie's baaad. It kinda ruins the book. For instance, Cotton isn't redheaded in the movie. I also don't want to see Teft portrayed by someone. All in all the book is pretty stupid and it's a relief the author's dead a Cotton's an eejit for commiting suicide. Or it was an accident. Who cares."
2,"This book has a good basis to be a fine novel, but..........","The author, Glendon Swarthout, does a horrible job by not keeping the reader interested. I agree with the reader from Vernon, NJ. The flashbacks definately take away from the book!"
2,I absolutely hated it,"I had to read this book for my eigth grade English class. I hated it, and it was horrible. Glendon Swarthout uses way too much figurative language, and I still cannot understand why it is considered to be a ""great American classic."""
2,It was the most different yet intersting book I've read !,First off I would like to say that reading is not my favorite thing to do and very oftenly I only read because I have to and I usually wait till the last minute to read everyting! Anyways this is my review: First off I would like to say that I didn't completely finish this book! But I am sure if i had completly finished it i would have liked it somewhat more!
5,bedwetters from the inside out,"Glendon swarthout gives readers an opportunity to view six adolescents whom society has already labeled misfits from the inside out. As the book progresses, you gradually learn the history of each member of the group from past incidents , namely unintentional mental abuse by parents. An excellent book for all adolescents whether you are ""the popular kid"" or don't quite fit in. Can be easily misinterpreted."
1,I disliked this book-It's boring,"I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone unless you're looking for something really boring to read. I didn't like it and the flashbacks totally threw me off. I thought making a book about boys chasing buffalo wouldn't turn anyone on unless it was the only book available while they were in jail. The ""Bedwetters"" seemed like some pretty lame people especially because they were teenagers who wet the bed. I thought the suicide threats by Goodenow were ridiculous and totally pointless to the book's story. I guess I give a star, menaing 1, one, but if 0 was a choice, i might pick that too."
1,i read it in english class,"this book was obviously written by the author to be so full of trippy flashbacks and obscure references that everyone would assume that it was ""deep"" and not try to puzzle out its real meaning-except english teachers! it seems as if the author simply wrote this book without several basic things 1)a plot 2)meaning 3)coherence 4)a grasp on the english language, and just hoped that it would come together at the end. it didn't! this book is like one of those modern art paintings that could be done by a five year old. If you are the kind of person who loves to ooh and aah over those because no one understands them, then you will love this book. If you are like me and just want cheap entertainment or real meaningful books then avoid this book and hope you never have my english teacher!"
1,the worst book ever made,"I think this book was horrible, after the bad story line and winy kids you want to light the book on fire. I was forced to read this book and I'm only in 8th grade. One thing I would have change is the ending, after enduring all that time thinking that they were finally going to become men. They kill there leader and make them all become babies again. I think this book was a waste of money and a waste of paper. This book infuriates me; it makes me want to throw up. With the presents of some comedy this book might have been funnier but no they had to make the worst book ever wrote. The story line is that these kids see these buffalo getting slatered, and these kids go up and try and break them out. And on the way cotton, Teft, goodenow, Lally 1 and 2 and Shecker get in some hijacked cars and shooting out some tires, and once they get there they almost fail but some how cotton comes up with this marvelous plan and sacrifices himself to save animals."
1,Dull and drawn out,"This book could be fully and completely told in 3 sentences or less, yet it is drawn out in an uneventful tale that is supposed to be suspenseful, but is generally unappealing. Although the linkage to the Bible is somewhat interesting, it loses its effect in this dull novel. I don't reccomend anyone waste their precious time reading about a group of boys going on a nightlong joyride."
2,The Beasts And Children,"My thoughts on the climax of the book are that I did not like the book's climax at all. The climax was when the six boys let the buffalo out of the pens. The characters were OK. The six main characters are Cotton the oldest child, Lally1 the oldest Lally brother, Lally2 the other Lally brother,Teft the only one that could drive, Shecker the fatest one , and Goodnow who who wets the bed. The setting of the story was OK. The story was set in Arizona. The flash backs are a major point in the story. There had to be about 70 of them in the whole book.If you are wondering the point of view is in 1st person point of view. Finally, symbolism,there was not a whole ton of symbolism in this story."
5,Something For Everyone,"To really enjoy this book I think you have to be in the right mindset-for people expecting a childish adventure or mature pyschological interpretation, disappointment is all you're goign to get out of the book. I however, enjoyed it immensely, and thought it was touching and raw. Not only did it present the characters as incredibly human, but I liked the flashbacks that detailed who the characters were and their past. This isn't the greatest book for readers who don't appreciate this style, so if you don't like a story with a deeper meaning (and a little child pyschology) then you're out of luck. And for the reviewers who read this book in English classes, etc. and did not enjoy it-perhaps that's because your taste isn't mature enough to appreciate it!"
1,AWEFULll!!!!!',This book sucks so bad iTs about 14 year olds that piss themselves really... Unless its for school do not buy this aweful book
3,Bless the Beast and Children Book Review,"I read the book Bless the Beasts and Children in my 5th hour english class, I really did not like that book very much. I did not like the flashbacks in the book because it made the book very hard to understand and it made me really confused. It would set a very bad example for little children like when they drove 200 miles to the buffalo preserve in the dodge. Or when Cotton was smoking a cigar. The Cotton was the leader of the Bed Wetter's which were the losers of the camp. The point of view was in 3rd person and I did not like that, I like when it is told in 1st person point of view because the main character is telling the story. I did not think that the book was that bad, but I would not recommend to anyone else to read."
4,FreeKiN' BeDwEtTeRs,"They always cry, they always wet the bed. They are wedbetters. They are wimps. I the process... of being men. This is a really good book. The beginning is ok. The rising action gets better. I wont tell you the story, but it gets better. The second rising action involves the bedwetters escaping and telling alot of flashbacks. They escape and thats the end of what I think is the second rising action. The climax is Great I think when they finnaly get to the buffalo preserve and fall in the blood it makes it more exciting. When they are actually releasing them its funny because they are driving in a van throwing food at them. Then lastly there is no falling action so that sucks, it just abruptly stops in the climax. Overall this is a great book If I were you I would deffinitaley by this book. Not for kids under 13."
4,it's great,"it truely is a great book and i'm glad that i got a chance to read it. although, the flashbacks did get kinda confusing. most people say they didn't like to read it, but that usually comes from the people who grew up reading the babysitter's club, or they haven't ever seen a starwars movie, and says it's stupid."
3,This book is pretty interesting.,"I read this book for a class at my high school, and as soon as I read the introduction, I knew it would be interesting and a good book to read. I liked the characters portrayed in the book, especially Cotton. He never backed down and he helped the ""bedwetters"" be able to do without his help. I especially liked the part where Teft shot out sideburns hot rod sliks with a .22. I thought it was pretty funny. I got confused at a couple parts, but overall, I'd say, if you want a good book to just sit down and read, get Bless the Beasts and Children"
2,A wierd book that keeps you on the edge,"Bless the Beasts and Children is a book I would not reccomend to anyone. Even though it may keep you on the edge of your seat. You always are wanting to know what stupid things the"" bed wetters"" are going to do next. The Flashbacks are confusing and the characters are obviously mis-fits that need a life. If you like the stories about adolescence in need of attention. read this book."
1,lousy,"bought cover girl power pink lipstick, i get more color from a chapstick, can't even tell i put it on, price was low, still got jipped"
2,egh!,It wasn't what I expected. It was too glittery for my taste. But I was satisfied with the s&h. Instead I bought the Saint Germain lipstick from MAC. Now that's more of what I was going for.
4,Looks well by itself,"Lovely lipstick, glides on smoothly, somewhat sheer. It is a dark red, almost wine. I layer it over a brighter red lipstick and the color is very beautiful. It also looks well by itself, but I don't wear a lipstick this dark."
3,COVERGIRL PINK CHIC,"THOUGHT FROM THE PICTURE, THAT LIPSTICK WOULD BE A DARKER SHADE---IT WAS WAY TOO LIGHT. NEXT TIME I WILL ASK QUESTIONS CONCERNING THE SHADE. DELIVERY WAS QUICK AND PRODUCT WAS IN MINT CONDITION. MY FAULT ABOUT SHADE NOT SELLERS. IT IS EASY TO APPLY BUT TOOOOOOOOOO LIGHT. MAY TRY ANOTHER SHADE BUT WILL FIND OUT MORE."
5,Perfect cosmetic,Just as advertised and now a discontinued color with CoverGirl. I will really miss it as they do not seem to have anything comparable.
1,lipstick,When I placed the order it indicated the lipstick was a 2-pack. When I received it the order was a single tube of lipstick. Had I know this I would not have order from this vendor.
3,pretty color,"nice color and very moisturizing but not lasting had to reapply often, despite that I am satisfied with my purchase."
1,Was never shipped,"Exactly the product that was desired, a discontinued product. I see now the person who offered the product is now doing business under a different name."
1,Disappointed,This looks like the same color on for a little bit-- then when it's almost gone it goes to a funny orange. I'm thinking its a knock- off or something. I still had a small amt. left of an original and it sure didn't do what this lipstick did. My husband asked-- what do you have on your lips-- he rarely notices a thing...
1,Wrong item shipped,"I ordered this item from Amazon as it is very difficult to find locally. I was very unbhappy when I opened the package and found the wrong item had been sent. I was shipped Cover Girl Honeyplum glow #800, when I had ordered Cover Girl Almost Nude #820"
4,GREAT,"THIS WAS A DISCONTINUED PRODUCT AND HARD TO FIND . I WAS GLAD TO FIND IT AND PLEASE WITH THE TRANSACTION AND PRODUCT , THANKS WILL PURCHASE AGAIN."
5,All Nite (Don't Stop) / I Want You CD2,"This is a great value CD single, it includes both ""All Nite (Don't Stop)"" and ""I Want You"", the new track ""Put Your Hands On"", two mixes and both videos. The enhanced videos look amazing, the video for ""All Nite (Don't Stop)"" included in this CD is the non-explicit version, the one shown on TV, because there is an explicit version of the video in the ""janet. to Damita Jo"" DVD, the video for ""I Want You"" is great, Jermaine Dupri makes a cameo appearance as Janet's boyfriend at the very end of the video. You get all this for only $12.99, very rare UK Import, hard to find in stores, your only chance to get it is here on Amazon.com!"
4,The Only Worthy Single From Damita Jo,"Damita Jo is a flop in my view but it did have a couple of decent singles and one hit making one. All Nite is that one in my opinion as it is the classic dance music that Janet is known for! Actually, she didn't really need to sing on this one as the music alone is the real star of this one! I haven't heard the other remixes but from the other reviews, they give it a thumbs up! I would recommend this single rather than the album that spawn it."
2,Hit&Miss cuts,the Re-Mixes help these cuts out a good deal but the songs themselves are just kinda missing something to me on a whole.Vocally not much improvment.the Re-Mixes are the saving point really though.
2,I miss the old Deep Purple...,"I couldn't wait to watch this! But, I was kind of disappointed. While musically this album was good, I can't help but miss the old Deep Purple with Ritchie Blackmore and Jon Lord. This wasn't the group I remembered. To me they just didn't seem to have it anymore---that hard driving sound that made them famous. Oh please, Smoke on the Water (on the Live at Montreux DVD) almost put me to sleep! I loved the group, but please, it's time to retire..."
5,They just keep getting better,"Awesome live show. The video is sharp, the editing is perfect, the sound is clear and loud, and the band look and are playing great. Nice to see the band still keeping on, and they've really trimmed alot of the excess noodling and extended solos from earlier incarnations to now just rocking and jamming away. 5 stars"
1,Disappointment!,"Although the concept is great, it is ruined by amateurish filming & reproduction. Color changes for no reason,the camera focuses on the wrong things, the sound is tinny -- it is an embarrassment! The young dancers do well & may inspire others -- but the story is ""told"" sketchily, omitting most of the first act of the ballet."
1,"At $1.00 per minute, definitely NOT WORTH THE PRICE!","The warm up was about the most useful exercise on this tape. Besides the horrendous pronunciations (including ballet terms), my daughter learned more from the Barbie Nutcracker. If only I had it to do again... :("
4,Nice watch,It looks very smart...also is pretty cheap but the only problem is that its belt is too big...does not fit around my wrist and I cannot adjust it..:(
2,Can make do,I used a very good crimper and I still had some pull loose. These really need to be soldered on if you will be plugging and unplugging them more than once.
3,"Cleans well, but not good at edges","Easy to assemble. Not that hard to push or pull. One attachment has no storage area on the vacuum. Doesn't clean edges very well, either using the front or the sides (leaves an area about 0.25in uncleaned). Cord does not store very well due to the long lenth (which is appreciated). Carrying handle is a nice feature when bringing the vacuum up and down the stairs. All in all, a good value for the price."
1,This Vacuum REALLY [is bad] (Not A Compliment!),"At the recommendation of a friend, I bought the Eureka Victory vacuum cleaner. Big Mistake! It doesn't pick up dirt well at all and anything larger than the most microscopic dust particle will remain on the floor for all eternity unless YOU pick it up. This vacuum cleaner is not the absolute worst I've ever seen, but it's darn close. And that's not a good thing. And it clogs up when the bag is LESS than half full! Don't waste your time, energy, anger or money on this one. It really [is bad]."
3,Good product but Drivers were a headache,I got this and I loved it because it was so cheap and it had good video quality and a built-in microphone. I caouldn't ask for more for the price. The only thing I did not like was that the drivers were really tough to install. It had taken me 10-20 minutes to install the driver each time I used it on a new computer or changed operating systems. I actually took the time to find the driver in it's folder and isolate it so I wouldn't have to deal with all the craziness of trying over and over again to get the driver working properly. The driver you get form windows update does not work properly. If you are going to get the driver installed properly make sure windows identifys this device as Dynex webcam and not the generic webcam name that windows gives it upon installation of the driver.
3,Underaverage in price and quality,"The title is pretty explanatory. It's price is underaverage and so is the quality, making the addage ""You get what you pay for"" a definite in this instance."
3,The Dewsweepers: Seasons of Golf and Friendship,"Not exactly as advertised. The book was written as a diary of 1 particular year in the author's life. Yes, he found friendship. Yes, he is a namedropper. Yes, it will keep you interested enough to see if there is an epiphany. (Will let you read to discover.)"
2,I agree...pretentious and name dropping...,"In reading the reviews of the book it describes a bunch of ""electic"" old men golfers...I don't find an eclectic thing about them...they're a bunch of old, privileged rich guys, who have the time and money for taking golf trips...pretty boring read.It's basically Dodson whining about a rough period in his life...something that we all face, but for some reason it seemed a little unexpected to him. Get over it and get in the real world.Don't waste your dollars on this one."
1,DO NOT BUY,"DO not buy a used remote! Although I did not get my remote through Amazon, I got a used one and took it to the dealership to be programed and discover that NO remote that has been previously programed and be re-programed."
5,for who is this rating excellent?,Read this and find out. :)One of you will not be disappointed. It becomes clear who is doing the reading. Highly recommend.
5,OM Ramana,"Ramana is the nectar of advaita/non-duality teachers. In this compilation of the Maharshi's meetings with disciples, author David Godman introduces the topic in a couple of pages before printing the talks. Others have summed up Ramana's teaching with something like: ""There is no separated doer"". If you want more, try this book."
5,The use of the Self-Enquiry to realize one's true Self.,"Ramana Maharshi is one of the most extraordinary guides to the realms of the spirit that I have encountered. This particular volume is, in my opinion, a very skillful description of Ramaman's thought; the best I've found in English. Ramana's message is that of the use of self-enquiry will lead one to have direct experience with the Self, one's true identity. He urges his followers to consistantly ask oneself the question ""Who am I"" and/or ""Who is asking this question"". He also places major emphasis on silence, especially the silence of the mind. The book is a conscise but thorough discussion of his method in all of it's aspects. Steven Levine, Ram Dass, and Ken Wilber all refer to Ramana Mahrarshi as a key teacher on their respective paths. I can concur in their assesment."
4,You are That.,"If you are already well versed in meditation and Hindu thought you will love this book. The reason it doesn't answer all of the questions is because the answers to the big ones are beyond mind and speech. Ramana Maharshi is teaching the reader a technique for identifying your self with that which is infinite. ""Be as you are"" transcends the ego-based quest with all it's ups and downs and hacks at the root of ignorance: identification with the wrong thing."
1,"I tried to read it, and faild","I tried to read it, and faild.It was confusing, did not get to any point. The questuion and answer format made iteven more confusing then it should have to be. It is one of the very few times that I actually have put down a book with out finishing it."
3,Exposits the central message of Sri Ramana Maharshi as best as words can,"While the style is anything but concise and to the point David Godman lays out the""teaching"" of the Sage of Aranachula in a way that should be accessible, if not particularly helpful, to those of a western mindset."
1,A Very Confusing Book,I'm sorry. I purchased this book hoping it would be an aid to my understanding of Hinduism and Eastern philosophy. It didn't. I'll stick with Paramhansa Yogananda and his crystal clear teachings. Maharshi's book seems to me an endless ring-around-the-rosies string of questions and contradictions. I found no answers.
2,I'm Not Alone . . . !,"I read this work approximately a year ago. I am afraid I was not impressed. I do appreciate Mr. Godman's carefully crafted arrangement of subject matter, otherwise a one star review would be justified. To me the array of questions stated were either dodged with the standard ""Look Within Yourself"" solution, or they were given the ""No, it does not exist"" - ""Yes, of course that is the true existence"" contradiction. I really cannot imagine how some of your reviewers can discover such wondrous revelations here.Simply put, I found absolutely no great knowledge or guidance in this volume, and I truly feel sorry for the poor guy who was trying to broaden his understanding of Eastern philosophy."
1,Give Me A Break !,"I am having a difficult time seeing in this book what many of the past reviewers apparently are. With exception of one review I'm to believe this book gives every answer to every possible question that could be asked. I've read it, then re-read it. Where they evidently behold golden wisdom I find questions answered with additional questions. What great wisdom is revealed by these methods are beyond me. Possibly this might more valuable to psychiatrists than spritical seekers."
5,Everyone should read this,"Surely one of the most thoughtful books this retired geologist has read in over 70 years of living. An intellectual feast, yet written for everyone's understanding. Among my top 10 recommended books for all."
3,Helpful as an overview,"Our homeschooled seventh grader found this book engaging as an overview of the period, especially when taken in context with other works, especially Out of the Dust by Karen Hesse, a child's-eye, heart-wrenching account of the worst years; the Grapes of Wrath by John Steinbeck; and the Dust Bowl songs of Woody Guthrie. The strongest point is that the book contains some excellent black and white photos that we hadn't seen elsewhere."
3,Recipie book,This looks like a good book with a lot of recipies but it was a little disapointing. I was hoping to get some healthier stuff out of it. Instead I think I got one recipie for French Toast. And that was it.I do like the idea......
2,mediocre,recipes in this book seem higher in fat and higher in sugar that I feel are recommended for healthy eating.high on carbs and starches.i have not used much from this book -as i prefer to feed healthier versions of foods to my kids.
2,Disappointing cookbook,Like others we were surprised to find that the recipes were predominantly very unhealthy. Our toddler loves mac n cheese as most do and we thought that this would help us find healthier alternatives but it does not. We are so displeased that we are returning it to Amazon.
3,Too much butter!,"I just received this book and though the recipes are original and fairly simple, I am disappointed in the amount of fat in them. Most recipes have a generous amount of butter in them. I like the section on appetizers and snacks.This book has something for everyone, including a vegetarian section, but I would really like to see these recipes tailored to cut out some of the saturated fats and include some whole grains. White flour and sugar are also common ingredients."
2,Unnecessarily Religious,"The cookbook is okay, though I agree it doesn't have the healthiest stuff. I was disappointed to find that it's sprinkled with prayers and quotes from Christian theologians such as Thomas Aquinas. As a Jewish person, I find it pushy and unnecessary to put this stuff into a COOKBOOK.Let me say that I have no problem with Christianity and wish there were more people of faith. But there are more appropriate places for trying to spread your message.If you don't mind Christian themes in your cookbooks, this one is fine. If you happen to be of another religion, you might want to stay away.(I should also mention that the quotes themselves are fairly generic and not overly preachy, but they are unmistakably Christian and prevalent enough to bother many.)"
5,My Son is Ecstatic,My son loves the Iron Man Hulk Buster action figure... It has cool armor plating and is heavy and substantial in your hands... It is his favorite action figure...
2,SPEED LOADER???,"I never use this ""Speed Loader"" because I find it speedier to load by hand. Probably good in a gun fight but for the range, I will use my hands."
4,Seems to work well,Fits perfectly with my Taurus 327 Federal Mag. Made of light weight plastic so remains to be seen how it will last over time.
1,Awful ... Buy It Used!,"I know I'll be struck down for saying so as an African scholar, but this book is as boring as anything I have ever read. It is of great use as a primary source, but is a tough go for every the hardiest of academics."
1,BORING and dry!!,"I had to read this for class and let me tell you, I damn near slip into a comma. Ugh, just boring. This is NOT a must read."
1,Equiano,"The product said it was in good shape, as soon as I open the cover the backing fell off of it, I didnt return it b/c I needed it for class."
1,Response to Robert Allison,"The 1772 publication date of Gronniosaw's _Narrative_ seems to have been recently established by Vincent Carretta in _Unchained Voices: An Anthology of Black Authors in the English-Speaking World of the 18th Century_ (Kentucky, 1996), with the evidence offered on pp. 53-54. The post-1791 editions in which Equiano understandably deletes the wording ""My hand is ever free--if any female Debonair wishes to obtain it"" after his April 7, 1792 marriage to Susanna Cullen are the 5th (Edinburgh, 1792), the 6th & 7th (both London, 1793), the 8th (Norwich, 1794), and the 9th and last (London, 1794). My source for this information is Vincent Carretta's authoritative Penguin edition of Equiano's _Interesting Narrative_ (1995), pp. 297-297, note 633. A reader from Virginia"
2,Understanding . . . not much help,"This book was difficult to read for this American due to the foreign (British?) verbage and sentence structure. It did not contain much information that I had not already attained through parenting magazines, etc."
1,Photo for item does not match product,"The photo shown for this item is incorrect. This item, number B0000DIDLU, is a plastic, open-face, belt holster.The leather-type case with clear plastic front shown in the photo is for another item. It is for item B0000DIDLV at URLwww.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000DIDLV."
3,"Goddo ""Who Cares""","I saw this group live and bought this album in the late 70's and they were great. Although I was young and my tastes were not as keen then and I liked recreational substances I still recommend this hard rockin anthem band. ""Carol Kiss my Whip"" is a poke of fun at Carol Pope the Canadian Butch punk rocker of that era.Many tracks in this CD with hardly a breather between cuts."
5,Battle for Arkwood begins!,"I really really liked this book! Battle for Arkwood: The Monster in the Sewer is probably one of the best books I've read this summer! It has twists and turns and a demon! If you're unfamiliar with the story, it's about three boys who have these nightmares about stuff happening up at their church... then stuff starts happening for real! It's scary, and funny, and I really enjoyed it! There's a cool part at the end where... oh! I can't spoil it for you! Read it! Battle for Arkwood! Awesome! First of a few I hope!"
3,A little worse than I thought,"The book was in a bit rougher shape than described. I'll keep it, but should have been rated a bit lower. It came quickly though!"
2,not what I wanted,I was looking for large print ROOK cards and thought that was where the internet took me.I already had large print playing cards and did not realize that is what I was looking atuntil after I placed my order.Does anyone know where I can purchase the large print ROOK cards?
5,Cultural mix,"Twisted experimental alternative music meets pop culture and yes Eskimo culture. This is an album before and after it's time. It is an entire story (that makes little sense) told musically. The R's spent over a year making this album, building their own authentic Eskimo instruments. By the way Eskimos use a completely different scale system than we do. Very visual- see the imagery as you listen. A band that purposely never sold out- brilliant. Cultural comments every few seconds. Irreplacable. Unique. One of the R's 3 best efforts including Commercial Album and Not Available."
2,"Great Sounds, but Ultimately One Dimensional","This is one of the Resident's better cds. I like Third Reich n Roll and the Duck Stab ep best however. But, the flaw with this effort - which has some really interesting sonics - is that its too ""cutesy."" There is some great music, err, SOUNDS here, but, like Zappa's ""weenie joke"" music, it is ruined by the humor aspect. I also liked the mole concept, but the ""ha ha weird"" factor ruined it for me. I find it difficult to listen to this one more than once every few years. Compare this with other non-jokey ""outside"" efforts that hold up to repeat listenings like Brian Eno's beautiful ethereal tone poems, or the Curable Intern's dark sonic nightmares, or Kraftwerk's danz-pulse."
2,Silly Ambience,This is a waste of your time. There's not much musical content here. Listen to Jon Hassell instead if you want a transcendental experience that relates to modern tribal cultures.
2,Can't recommend this feeder,"I am disappointed with this feeder. They say it holds three pounds of seed, but I really doubt this. Filling the feeder is very difficult - the openings under the roof are too narrow - a funnel doesn't work and seed spills everywhere just trying to get it into the feeder. The wood is nice, but I would definitely not buy this again and would return it if it wasn't such a hassle."
3,Judah Prayze,"For me this CD was just ok. The very first track and of course the track ""Judah Prayze"" are my favorites. He can't sing at all, but the woman who was adlibing in the background on track number one can definitely sing. I mainly purchased this CD for Judah Prayze because it wasn't available on itunes or mp3 downloads. I wouldn't waste money on this CD."
5,Great Mix of Gospel Music Styles,"From the modern R&B sound, to neo-soul, to old-fashioned gospel, this CD has it all. Talk about under-appreciated. This CD has fantastic cuts like its title song ""Judah Prayze"" and such cuts as ""Everybody Oughtta Know"" and ""What about Your Soul."" This artist brought in a number of talented producers and musicians to produce an absolutely FANTASTIC album. Love it."
2,Cheap,I used it for a day. it really inhibited the usage of the covered buttons and you can't get the damn thing out of your pocket because it's like flypaper.
2,Did not like this,"I bought this for my moto-q phone because my husband and I have the same exact phone and cover which makes it hard to tell them apart at times. In the picture the cover looks much darker but, when I put this on my phone it is very thin looking and the color doesnt really stand out. There is also no cover for the screen.At this time I am not even using it and I am looking for something better."
3,You get what you pay for,"I can't complain too much, but it looked great on the phone, but it did nothing by way of protecting my phone. it would slide off when I would pull my phone out of my pocket. it started to rip 3 months after I got it, but it was worth the money."
3,"Just a little more anatomy, please.","As a novice family nurse practitioner, this book has been tremendously helpful. My only disappointment is that it does not include basic anatomy. In addition, I think the title is a misnomer. It should really be called ""Essentials of Skeletal Care"" because there are no anatomical muscular references in the book."
3,Would work well without the extended battery,"I just got this in the mail yesterday, and I liked the fit and functionality of it, except for the fact that I have an extended battery, and the form of the skin is distorted by the battery case in back (would give it a 4 otherwise). Other then that, it was easy to put on, and all the buttons are clearly accessible or work well under the cover of the skin."
4,"Like the Q, Slim","So far, so good! This skin has held up to everything I have thrown at it over the last six weeks. It is not as thick as BoxWave's product that I had on my Treo, but neither is the Q. No problems with that lack of bulk. It does seem to attract dust, etc. and I have to wipe it down occasionally for it to look nice. I prefer this color to the smoke that I also bought."
3,Q cover,"great cover , dose not protect the screen but i knew that when i bought it .. good item for the price ..."
4,With one exception,The only thing that is missing is a cover for the screen itself. The skin makes the phone sticky so doesn't slip out of my hand. It is a bit tough getting it in and out of a pocket but the protection it provides is worth dealing with that issue.
1,Like my products in one piece.,Recieved this product ripped and had to throw it out. Was offered a bribe to remove this review. They didn't come through on the bribe either!
4,Adidas Men's rEvolution III Pant,"These pants are very comfortable, mesh lining breathable, and they fit pretty good. The ONLY issue I had, was that they were a tad bit LONG. I'm 5'7, 165lbs. and I ordered a Medium, which like I said fits well for me, but the leg pants itself were a bit long. I'll see what I can do to get them hemmed up, if possible. Thats the reason I gave it a 4 out of 5 stars..."
5,clothes should be like this,i get out of my shower and relax in the most comfortable clothes that exist
1,Pierce Completes her Literary Sell Out,"... The only true fantasy in this fantasy book is wishy-washy approach to life the characters exhibit. If you want preaching against premarital sex and 16 year olds exchanging chaste pecks, then this is the book for you. If you want honesty and a refreshing, original look at the confusion and joy of becoming a woman and dealing with gender binding issues then read any of the Song of the Lioness Quartet. ... these four books are the pinnacle of her career. .... Squire is watered down ..."
1,Awesome Book!,"THis is the best book in the whole world. It's so good that it stinks. I hated it. I like this book so I give it 1 star. It's good, no wait it's very bad."
5,Squire,I LOVE Squire!!! It's my favorite book in the series!! I like it so much because I really like action and romance. I think it is an Awesome book! One of Tamora Pierce's best.
3,Not as good as the previous ones.,"Kel is now a squire. She has finished her four years as a page. To where she's going now some people have died. Kel is still the tough girl she was before, but her emotions and feelings have changed. For instance, Neal has disappeared out of Kel's life and ..Cleon stands in his place. When I rushed into the bookstore to buy this, I expected a much better book. It really bored me.Kel's charm has disappeared. Everything is predictable and boring. Tamora Pierce could have done a MUCH better job."
3,Hmmm...,"I totally agree that this book could have been better. But in every series that Tamora Pierce has written there is 1 book that I thorouly dislike. I haven't picked up ""The Woman Who Rides Like a Man"" since I first read it, and I don't plan on doing so. Ever. That was the 1 from Alanna. Daine didn't really have one that i don't like. But in the Magic Circle, I didn't like Daja's book at all. But I really think this is the one from the Kel series that I will really shun. Unless the 4th is worse. But think about it. Tamora Pierce got better, right? I mean, though i really disliked the 3rd book in the Alanna series, I loved the 4th. So, just as she came back then, I think she'll come back now. The fourth one shall be great."
4,animemojo,I loved the book...I read the entire day for ten hours! I loved the story also! I must tell you though that kel's feeling for neal go away and go for someone else. his name starts with a CL and ends with an EON. it's so adorable but I didn't like the ending though cuz cleon wasn't there. kel inspired me to believe in what's right and have courage and that anything is possible. It's a truly inspiring book. you should really get it.I can't wait till the next book...too bad it comes out in 2002. I don't know if I can wait!
4,Coming of age and swordfighting: a skillful transition book,"Keladry Mindelan, Kel for short, is the first girl openly enrolled in the prestigious school for knights. Surviving prejudice, hard study and deadly bandits, Kel is growing up as an examplary squire.A transition book, with mild romance, conventional plot, but skillful pacing and engaging characters and world, this book will appeal to fans of earlier books, children and adults both."
3,Dissappointig...,"Though I enjoyed the other books in the triology, I must admit that this book dissappointed me. Nothing about it was developed enough. Things happened. That was that. It was rushed, trying to fit things in without... ANYTHING, but saying that they happened. Of course, she might have TRIED to describe some stuff, but it wasn't enough. Plus, Kel doesn't really have a purpose (save helping the weaker, as always) until the end. But when that finally happened, the book ended! The best thing to do would be to wait for a copy at your library, or buy a used/paperback edition later (you have to read it so the events of the next one will be clearer). However, because of this ""purpose"" at the end, the next book seems to be promising. Let's just hope she can manage to keep Kel CLEAN, as she has found impossible to do with her other Tortall stars..."
4,Yeah well....,"I love this book because Kel becomes Raoul's squire. In the Alanna books, he isn't a very well developed character, and I was really happy to see him reappear, especially as Kel's knight master. I was dissapointed that Kel and Neal didn't fall in love, but that would have been too much like the Alanna books with Jon and Alanna. Besides, Neal is too cynical for Kel. She is completely a fighting knight and Neal is mostly a desk night, like myles."
4,Protector of the Small #3- Squire,"I actually thought this book was better then the one before it (Page) which surprised me as usually I find in Tamora Pierce's quartets the first book is the best, then they get slowly a little worse each time. But even though Kel wasn't working aound the palace any more, this book was still really intresting and it was great that it was a lot longer then the first two books. I have one complaint: Cleon. ....Otherwise the book was brilliant. I loved all the bits with jousting and Kel's visions outside the Chamber of the ordeal. I now think I undestand what the Ordeal does; as well as making Kel face her fears inside the chamber, it set her a challenge for the future, as it did Alanna ( Kel's was the metal machines-Alanna's was Duke Roger.) A great addition to this quartet and I'm really looking forward to reading book 4, Lady Knight."
4,Not as good as the first two,Kelandry of Mindelan made it through all four years of knight training school and now all she has to do is wait for someone to choose her as their squire. She hopes that she will be chosen by Lady Alanna but expects to become a desk squire. She is presently surprised when Lord Raoul chooses her.I didn't like this book as much as the first two but it's still a great book. The beginning was a bit on the boring side but the plot picked up before I was thoroughly bored. I kind of missed the school setting and I really missed a lot of the characters. The book was also more action packed than the others which was a good and a bad thing. I really liked the romance even though Kel's boyfriend was not who I'd have picked for her (I'm not telling who it is) This was a good book but I'm not really as anxious to start the fourth one as I was the third.
3,Great Series but....,"Tamora Pierce is one of my favourite authors and I really do enjoy this new series of hers but this third book wasn't as exciting as the previous two. It was a bit boring and the book seemed to be dragging on slightly but gets better towards the end. The ending was...interesting and held a very anticipated meeting for Kel. However, the romance with Cleon was disappointing and overall the book wasn't as satisfying as the others."
3,"Very good, However....","Very good book in many ways...enjoyable, and well written. However, Tamora Pierce seems to be hung up on the idea of dumping a guy in the middle of a series...remember Alanna and Jonathan? (a more extreme case) Now it's Keladry and Neal. Is this realism, or is it a personal author hang-up?"
5,"Squire, an excelant book!","This is the third book in the Protector of the Small series. In it, Kel has passed the big examinations, and has become a squire, join her as she captures bandits and fights immortals with the Kings Own. A great read!"
4,squire,"this was a great book. i knew cleon had a crush on kel from the previous book, but i never thought it would go that far. i wish there had been more romance between the two, and that he had been there at her coronation. i think that would have made this a lot better. still, i couldn't put the book down until i had read it twice! great book, two thumbs up!"
2,"Wasn't worth the $, here's why","This book has very little info {unfortunately} regarding Janis' history in terms of her career as a singer. There's 'some' interesting details in there. However overall, it's just repetitive sexual experiences her lover describe/writes about her and Janis Joplin. If it had been a book about her male lovers that would've been far more interesting. I was hoping to get more about her background as a professional singer + her roots/upbringing in the south.If your a lesbie, you may want this crazy book.But I wasted my $$$. Oh dawg gonnit."
3,A VERY DARK LOOK AT JANIS AT HER WORST,"After Janis broke up with Country Joe McDonald, Peggy Casserta enters her life as her torrid flame. The entire book dwells on the love relationships of Janis and Peggy and could very well be made into an X-rated film someday. This is a must read for all real Janis Joplin fans."
5,the greatest Italian singer ever,"First of all, the best Italian-American album ever. Put this in the CD player, pour a glass of wine, sit by the pool, add a little salami, provolone, and tender olives, lite the porch lites out back, and you are back listening to the songs Mama and Papa sang. This CD is so good you cant stop listening to it. I am not kidding. My kids listen to it with me. Mt father-in-law and I would sit by the pool every Sunday night, sip wine and listen to Jerry...it was heaven on Earth...and I miss those nights so much...buy this CD and see for yourself...you will know exactly what I mean. The memories are all we have left. Come join me.Bobby"
3,Valed tears,"Jerry Vale had the look, the grin, the hair, the easy comfy comraderie of Italian boys that sang like angels with no rebel intrigue. Perry Como looked like Marlon Brando compared with Jerry.But Jerry had a style, and a voice that could reach bel-canto tones better than most of the other second tier singers of the '50's. Jerry was not Dean or Tony or good-gracious Frank, but he had a following, mostly due to his friendly nature and willingness to befriend a crowd.This CD is a sampler of his Italian songs, sung true in dialect and passionate! The recordings are remastered to stereo and sound terrific, much better than the Columbia LPs or worse, 45s.Note: David Letterman used to have Jerry on his NBC late night show as a sort of an ironic joke...except it made Jerry popular again and showed his great sense of humor!"
5,Beautiful voice of Jerry Vale,Hi Jerry Vale has a beautiful voice and this Cd has a lot of my favorites. He's wonderful! I would add this to your collection of Italian CD's. Warm Regards: Cathy Alexander(NH)
5,THE BEST ITALIAN/AMERICAN SINGER:JERRY VALE,"I LOVE THIS LP. I HAVE IT ON CASSETTE, I LISTENED TO IT, AND I HAD TO GET IT ON CD FOR MY FATHER. I GREW UP WITH THESE ITALIAN/AMERICAN SINGERS. DEAN MARTIN, JULIUS LAROSA, LOU MONTE, AL MARTINO, ETC.... BUT, IN MY CASE THE BEST IS JERRY VALE. I LOVE DEAN MARTIN, BUT WHEN HE SINGS INNAMORATA(SWEETHEART)HE DOES NOT SING THE WORDS CORRECTLY. DEAN MARTIN IS FANTASTIC, DO NOT GET ME WRONG, BUT WITH JERRY VALE HIS SINGING IS CALM, SOOTHING, AND HE SINGS WITH THE CORRECT ITALIAN LANGUAGE. AS A AMERICAN/ITALIAN I FEEL HONORED TO BE ONE, AND HAVE A GREAT BUNCH OF SINGERS FROM ITALIAN BACKGROUNDS."
1,Most miserable book EVER!,"I'm a senior (4th year) electrical engineer at a well known engineering school. I believe i have an IQ somewhere above a 20 (sarcasm) and this is the most convoluted, useless piece of crap ever. The course should be relatively simple and the material is pretty straight foward... however, the book makes the material a chore to learn. There are few examples, poor definitions, and vague explanations. If you are a professor, do not get this book unless they pay you! And if you did get the book, you would do a disservice to all your students (the reason why you have a job,... unless you're one of those ""research"" professors)"
5,This CD Will Put *NSYNC Back Into the Spotlight!,"This CD has all of the NSYNC chart toppers from their 'Tearin Up My Heart' days through the 'It's Gonna Be Me to their most recent work, 'Girlfriend'! This is a great collection of songs.Another plus to the CD is that it has a song that has never been realeased in the US, 'I'll Never Stop'! (I'll Never Stop was produced for their UK No Strings Attached Album, though)Also it includes 'The Music of my Heart'.Unfortunaetly it does not include any new materal, but all of the great songs on the CD make up for it!"
4,N SYNCH CD,This N'SYNCH cd has at least two favorite songs on them and I enjoy most of the rest. One of thier most popular hits is not included but the CD is great anyway!
4,more than needed,"there are only five songs worth listening to. they were the only actual hits, the others suck. It's probably cheaper to just buy Bye, Bye, Bye, It's Gonna Be Me, I Want You Back, Tearin' Up My Heart, and Pop. If you liked the other songs, then painfully listen."
3,Completing the Circle,"While I am just completing my collection, but I was really looking forward to some kind of new song. Unforunately I will have to buy ""On The Line"" soundtrack if I want to listen to anything different. It is too bad that they broke-up because not everyone just likes Justin by myself. Especially since he appears very full of himself."
1,''''',"NSYNC for me is the only boyband who can sing and dance at the same time. Well, that's something hard to do...Anyway, just want to say how good they are in acapellas. They have the perfect acapellas that I have ever heard. My Pap is a pro musician and he also like their harmony accdg to him they're really good in it.I know not everyone like NSYNC but personally I love them."
1,FINISHED FOOLS,Barely anyone knew this came out. It didn't even go gold. This proves how FINISHED these FOOLS are.
2,A Waste,"Most of their songs were not even good to begin with, but besides that, they don't even give a single new song. Even BSB's 2001 GH's album had a new song.Still to this day, even though the teen pop craze was over four years ago, I still consider *N Sync pale Backstreet Boys knock-offs. Even when their management did their best to hype them over BSB in the states, BSB's record sales still top *N Sync's.The only really good song they ever had was the awesome Richard Marx's ballad ""This I Promise You."" ""Gone"" had glimpes of greatness, but Timberlake's vocals ruined it which is a shame.*N Sync...Justin Timberlake's stepping stone to superstardom. He just used the other four guys....what were their names again?"
3,"Thanks, anyway...","I already own ""No Strings Attached"" and ""Celebrity""; I'll have to pass this one since it's not really an ""official"" greatest hits compilation - no promotion from any members of the group or tours in support of this release. No new tracks or live versions whatsoever as well."
3,Not Too Great,They could've had remixes to spice up their GR HITS album.Actually liked Backstreet Boys Greatest Hits better!
5,incredible art,Patrick Fillion's art is so precise that his characters seem to come alive. Now if I could only coax them to jump off the pages.
5,Game On!,"I was completely amazed by the quality of this set. We were fortunate enough to pick one up while it was on sale. However, I would be more than happy to pay the $100+ price tag. Yes, this set is that good."
4,"Great value, but beware","I bought these because it was an inexpensive set. What I didn't take into account (a lack of foresight on my part) was that having the chips labeled in US currency denominations (1, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100), in the given amounts (100 chips of each, except for 150 1s and 50 100s), makes for an unusual poker night.I don't mean just how many chips you start with, as I found running a tournament where everyone gets 500 in chips is workable with this set, but putting together a blind structure and handling chip color-ups is just awkward where 10s, 20s, and 50s are doing the work that 25s would do in a regular game (also limiting is the fact that these three denominations make up half the chips you get).If you don't mind the odd (for poker) denominations, you certainly get a lot for your money with the case, the racks, and 600 chips that look and feel nice."
3,Good Chips for the Price,"The chips are decent but, the carrying case and one of the chip racks arrived all cracked up."
3,Lots of vibration,"I put these on my Kawasaki Concours 1400. They fit fine but there's so much vibration that they aren't super useful. I have Hippo Hands that block the factory mirrors, so I needed something to give me visibility while using the Hippo Hands in cold weather. They DO give me some visibility because they are higher up, so it's better to have them than to not have them.They work great as blind spot mirrors, and they're easily mounted higher up (this was a problem on the 08-09 Connies), but they're super fuzzy at speed."
3,"Great Idea, Bad Overall Construction","I have to re-order this product every year. The mirror eventually loosens up, with the tightening screw stripping out in the plastic housing. Not the end of the world, but with so much loose play, the mirror wobbles back and forth at any sort of highway speed. Kind of annoying, and could be easily fixed for this great overall product idea."
4,Useful but construction could have been better,"This is a useful product. It helped us spot cars in the blind spot a couple of times in the past year. However, the construction is flimsy. Looks like it could fall apart or come off the mount anytime. For this price, the manufacturer could have done a better job. Not sure if there are many other products like this on the market though."
5,Auxilary Wide-Angle Side-View Mirror (Medium),"This Aux. mirror is the perfect addition to your car, it allows you to see the cars in your ""Blind Spot"" perfectly, very easy to assemble, and easy to adjust. All in all, it's a great value!!"
5,Great mirror,"The mirror works great, completely eliminates the blind zone. I use them with Toyota Prius 2010, have one on each side. The only thing I am afraid of is that somebody is going to steal them, it only takes a screw driver to take them out."
4,It does what I wanted,"This mirror takes care of the driver side blind spot issue with the small side mirrors on a Volvo V70 wagon. It looks kinda strange perched on top (bottom is too low) of the stock mirror and is not the same color but it hold steady, doesn't wiggle or shake too much and covers the big blind spots when merging lanes, passing, backing out of parking spaces, etc. Haven't tried to take it through a car wash yet...that'll be a good test. After a couple of months, so far so good. It's better than stick-on spot mirrors that take up space on an already too-small side mirror or big, wide replacements for the standard internal rear view mirror."
4,Auxilary Wide Angle Side-View Mirror,This auxilary mirror fits beautifully on top of my 2007 Honda CR-V rear view mirror. Mounting is easy and doesn't vibrate when driving 60-70mph. Tilting function is precise and stays where placed. Have used the mirror 3 months.
2,not very good or practical; there are better and far less expensive alternatives,"I bought it recently for $16.95 and will probably return it. I like far better CIPA 49702 2-1/2"" x 3-3/4"" HotSpots Stick-On Convex Wedge, which is $2.49 at Amazon (I installed it inside the car, and the view is excellent)."
1,Great for a little while,"These mirrors worked great for almost a year but I live in Wisconsin and that means Ice and Snow. The mirrors began to rust under the glass making them useless. Too bad, I really loved the extended views and got used to looking at them vs. the manufacturer's mirrors. I was very disappointed."
5,Great aggition,As a retired truck driver I hate blind spots. My pick up had too many of them. This solves the problem.
5,Outstanding Product!,"I must be honest based on all of the other products like this, I assumed that it was a set of 2 mirrors for the price.. I finally got around to installing it which took about 3 minutes. Works great!! Like another customer had suggested I mounted my mirror on the bottom of the side view mirror. Very sturdy design and very solid once installed. To make a long story short it was worth every penny and I have just added the second mirror to my cart before writing this review.***REVIEW UPDATE***I have been using these mirrors for a month or so now... Once again GREAT PRODUCT!!! Here is what I found out though... If you mount the mirror to the bottom of your existing mirrors, make sure the WIDE ANGLE mirror does not hit the paint on your car if you close the side view mirror. It hits my paint.. I had to move the wide angle mirror to the top of my side view mirror."
3,"So far, so good",I've had these on both sides of my cargo van for about a month now. The blind spot visibility is much improved. I found installation to be a bit tricky. The clamp on the auxiliary mirror is thick enough that it makes contact with the existing mirror on my van so it will make it harder to adjust it in the future. It seems that over time the auxiliary mirror is dropping a bit - most likely due to the fact that the ball and socket joint is too loose. I intend to caulk the mirror in place when it gets warmer. All in all a good improvement over just the stock mirrors at a price less than it would have cost to completely replace the stock mirrors with a double mirror system mounted on a bar.
3,Uneven and odd,"Mutilation Man is a post apocalypse weirdo splatter flick, demented and hypnotic. Strange doesn't quite cut it, kind of like Organ mixed with the Toxic Avenger, Begotten, Tetsuo, Santa Sangre and a bunch of other cult movies. Yes there is some gore but not in the traditional horror capacity, basically a guy mutilates himself as a traveling side show attraction in the country. At times you think the makers of this just wanted to freak people out with gross and twisted scenes. The story is going to be hard to figure out upon the first viewing, it really gets lost among all the surreal visuals. Maybe that's the point of it all?It's likely a love it or hate it deal, for me it was just ok. There are much better underground movies out there, and in the gore genre this is only average in my book. Stuff like Street Trash and the Toxic Avenger is more entertaining imo."
1,MOVIE MUTILATION,"I GOT THIS MOVIE BECAUSE I AM A HUGE JIM VAN BEBBER FAN AND STILL OWN IT FOR THAT FACT BUT BASICLY ITS NOT MUCH OF A MOVIE BUT I GUESS IT IS WORTH SEEING IF YOU ARE A FAN OF HIS ALTHOUGH HE DOESNT CONTRIBUTE MUCH TO IT, TRY TO SEE A COPY BEFORE BUYING IT, IT IS STILL WORTH SEEING FOR THE NOVELTY BUT NOT WORTH THE TWENTY DOLLARS BUYING IT WITH SHIPPING AND ALL THAT INCLUDED I BELIEVE THAT IS ABOUT WHAT IT COST ALTOGETHER"
2,Blahhhhh...,"The writing style of the book was neat, but the story dragged and I only read 95 pages as I was not into it. Sorry!!"
4,"Dear Elizabeth, From the Society of Good Books.","Dear Elizabeth,We at the Society for Good Books would like to formally welcome you to our illustrious fold. We realize, of course, that ""Feeling Sorry For Celia"" may not be one of the quitencential literary books for generations to come, as it lacks the required number of meditations of the universe and contemplations of your navel, but, we at the Society recognize the originality and the heart that went into producing this very funny and sharp book about the insecurities of being a teenager. Please tell Jaclyn Moriarty to keep up the good work.Sincerely,The Society of Good Books,Recognizing and rewarding books that deserve recognition and reward."
5,I loved this book!,this was a great book :) I highly recommend it. I also let Vanessa borrow this one :)
4,Feeling Sorry For Celia,"I thougth Feeling Sorry for Celia was an excellent book. Parts of the story are things teens can relate to, such as attempted suicide, boyfriends/girlfriends, etc. But I like how other events were pretty out threre, such as running away to join the circus. Here in America, you can't do al lot of those type things, but I guess in Australia you could. I think what made the book really original was the way it was written using notes from the girl to her mother, and her pen pel. I haven't seen too many other book slike it. One of the only things I didn't like about the book was that I didn't know some of the Australian words. But I could figure them out using context clues. All in all, I think Feeling Sorry For Celia was a very well written book that many teens would enjoy."
4,Charming!,this was such a sweet book and so easy to read. I thought it was very cleverly written and will pass this on to my best friend. This would be a perfect book to read at the beach! I would have given it 41/2stars but thats not an option.
4,Loved the main character,"Very cute book. I loved Elizabeth and her mom, and ended up not feeling all that sorry for Celia. The devise of using letters, notes, and postcards to tell the story was very interesting, and made for an interesting look into the life of a teenager. (One who isn't in love with any supernatural creatures at that!)"
4,Feeling Sorry for Celia,"Elizabeth from, Feeling Sorry for Celia, is a teenage girl that faces challenges in life. Despite dealing with divorced parents, teenage groups and trying to fit in, and her best friend, Celia, always running away, she still stands strong on her two feet. She has an opportunity to run in a marathon, meet new people, and have a first love, and she takes that wonderful chance. This story teaches a lesson about being yourself and having fun. Once you start reading, you can't stop!"
4,Well-Done Teen Novel,"Feeling Sorry for Celia is a very well done teen novel, one which certainly should appeal to those who haven't seen those years in a while, but still enjoy reading about them. The novel, which concerns high school student Elizabeth Clarry, is told entirely in letters, a construct that works naturally here. Elizabeth is an aspiring long distance runner who (like most teens) feels that somehow she doesn't fit in. Her best friend, Celia has disappeared (again), her father has reappeared on the scene, Elizabeth has discovered a boy on her school bus and found a new pen pal friend from across town as part of an English project. The novel is warm and amusing. It's not quite as sophisticated as Sloppy Seconds, as an example, but is still quite fun. Enjoy."
4,Niiiice,"This book was released in the aftermath of the much acclaimed 'Looking for Alibrandi', I think, and is pretty much in the same vein. I actually like it better. Elizabeth is a more likeable heroine than Josie, and although Melina Marchetta's book tends to be more serious, I think they both deal with some pretty heavy issues. The format, a series of letters and notes, is unusual and effective and the reader gains a view of 'between the lines'!Unfortunately, the book doesn't bear re-reading too often. If you read it more than three times in a month, the tone becomes self-pitying and Celia almost unbearable. But it's a fantastic book for teens and adults. Funny, sensitive and not too heavy handed. Congratulation Jaclyn Moriarty. You've written a staple of my, and others' bookshelves."
1,Not so funny after all,"I was really disappointed in this book. The letters from all the made-up committees and organizations were so clever and funny, but the overall feel of the book was depressing. Teenagers with mixed-up, messed-up and dysfunctional lives. I was also offended by the amount of swearing in this book. I think the lady that wrote this had a great idea with all of her notes and letters, but I gave up on the book about half-way through and returned it very disappointed."
3,Not super good,I thought this book moved a little slowly in some parts. I also thought some of the ideas and things in here were a bit far fetched.
4,Feeling Sorry for Celia,"Elizabeth is the best friend of the runaway hippie-bred Celia, the daughter of an eccentric divorced mother, and the definition of your straightforward Aussie school-girl. More importantly, she is on the mailing list of numerous ""assocations"" such as the Cold Hard Truth Association, who play a large part in animating her otherwise typical life actions. Christina is the newest addition to Elizabeth's life, and through their letters an unexpected friendship unravels, bringing belly laughs and watery eyes to the lucky reader. The entire content of this book is letters, notes, and other tidbits of correspondence - missing out on this amazingly witty book would be stupidly waving a most wonderful opportunity away!"
4,WOW,"Feeling Sorry For Celia is such a heart-warming book. NO seriously though. It was so good. At first I kinda wanted to put it down but i kept reading and I am so glad that I did. I thought the ending was a little un-realistic but that's okay I liked it anyways. It felt like everything happened that could possibly happen in this book. From unique dinners to mischievous boyfriends, this book is awesome!"
1,too much social reality too early,"I generally like these books, but this one was awful. It's about girls not being allowed to go anywhere in ancient Greece, not being allowed to go to school, or the olympics, or anywhere outside, and not being allowed to learn to read or write... my 3 yr old girl and 5 yr old boy were really distressed by the injustice of it (the girl burst into tears!). I just don't see any need to put the idea into young people's minds that boys and girls aren't equal. It left all of us with a real bitter taste... there are plenty of other/better books for your youngsters, so choose something else. (oh, and there's nothing about the olymics in the book anyway!)"
1,NOT historical fiction!,"As a parent and future Elem. teacher I read this book with my son for a book club that he and I run at his school for 3rd and 4th graders. My son and I enjoyed reading this book...the chapters flow quickly and the subject matter was interesting. However, I was VERY disappointed, when after a quick internet search on the ancient olympics to find out that a major premise of this story is NOT true! Girls WERE permitted to attend the ancient olympic games -- yet in this story we are taught that they were not. This is a major theme in this story and I am baffled as to how the author and publisher could have produced such a book with out checking such a simple fact! I feel that I can no longer trust the Magic Tree House books to provide accurate historical information to my son. I'd rather him not read these book if he's going to learn erroneous information from them."
3,In defense of the historical information included...,"The first person to review this book said that it included an erroneous fact that women were indeed allowed to participate in the ancient Olympics. Actually, at first women were not permitted to participate, nor were they allowed to be spectators until the 2nd century A.D. They did, however, have their own festival at Olympia called the Heraia with the only sporting event being a short race. In Sparta, a state in southern ancient Greece, girls were encouraged to take part in sports and games (Olympics, Oxlade and Ballheimer; Eyewitness Books, 1999). So, the information provided in this book is actually factual."
5,As the 2010 Olympics Unfold,As the 2010 Olympics unfold in Vancouver I turned to one of my favorite book series to find out what the olympics are about.Well this book really concentrates on the olympics as they started out back in Greece. Very interesting about all the different sports and the competions.Now I have a feeling what these types of international competions are about. good book.
4,Fascinating glimpse of a great man,"This hour-long film consists mainly of an interview with Laurens van der Post, author, friend of Carl Jung, and godfather of Prince William. The interviews, which must have taken place shortly before his death, focus on his imprisonment by the Japanese during WW2 and his quest for the last people living the traditional life of the Bushman (San) in the Kalahari Desert in the 1950s. There are several excerpts from the film he made for the BBC on that quest, a film that is otherwise unobtainable; anyone who has read Lost World of the Kalahari will find these fascinating. Disappointingly, there is very little about other periods in his life, but what we do get is a very worthwhile experience of this truly exceptional human being."
2,Brittle,"While the compositions are inventive and Lloyd's band is superb, Lloyd's playing seems brittle much of the time. It is a painful experience hearing a musician loose his breathe control in the middle of a passage. I suspect many listeners will give him the benefit of the doubt and attribute this to artistic license. However, for me Lloyd does not sustain his power throughout much of this CD. For this reason, ""Forest Flower"" is the weakest link in my 1960s collection and warrants being dropped from the ""Best of the 60s"" list. To get a real feel for how extraordinary Lloyd's playing can be, seek his comeback album on ECM from 1989, ""Fish Out of Water""."
5,One of the first Jazz Titles I Owned,"Back in 1968, or so, I first heard this album. I was just discovering jazz as a high schooler. This music has held up very well over time and I enjoy it as much now as I did when I was first coming to understand jazz."
3,Its ok just wish the side part...,Yeah I just wish the side part was easier to manage or none at all and the hair smells plasticky which makes me afraid to put heat in it. I am a weaving and braid technician so the hair was kind of difficult for me to corn row but with some persistance and some patience eventually got it to corn row. As I said it is OK not the best but ok and get the clamp that comes along with it it is very good and useful trust me!!
2,A Weak Brewer Output,"My interest in this album originated from Spencer Brewer's superb two earlier releases ""Portraits"" and ""Dorian's Legacy."" Both albums were very evocative, highly melodic and simply soothing.""A Romantic Interlude"" is a huge disappointment that one is compelled to ask, ""Has Mr. Brewer reached melodic bankruptcy?""For those who liked ""Portraits"" and ""Dorian's Legacy"", steer clear from this album. It is a very weak creation from someone who certainly cold have done better. Uninspired work."
5,yo visite Ganimedes,"An outstanding book, you MUST read it, find it, search it, I did it, it was worth it, It will give you the answers to most of your questions, about earth and more!"
3,"Spicy curry is very easy to use, but too hot fo rme.","I fell in love with yellow chicken curry after a vacation to Hawaii. I though that by buying an Indian brand curry paste, I could make the dish easier and faster. I do not like hot, spicy food, but I like curry flavor. This paste is too hot for me. If I use one table spoon for the whole pot (feeds 8 people) it's too much. If I got back any, I don't get the curry flovor and the dish is not yellow. This would be great for someone who wants to make a fast yellow curry dish, and who likes it HOT!"
1,A research guide,"This book is a research guide, not a biography, which is only valuable to a subset of scholars. There are no illustrations. Do not buy this book."
3,Not sure this works...,"I have had this product for quite a while now and I'm still undecided if it works or not. Like most ionic purifiers, it has a pleasant smell, but only if you get really close to it. Unlike the Ionic Breeze I have in my office, you can't tell if this is working or not. With my office unit, there is a really pleasant smell in the room, however with this unit, there is no smell at all in the car."
1,Do the math,"If you do the math, one pack of 80 count wipes are $4.60. Here you are paying $42 for 5 packs or $8 dollars a pack. This is way overpriced and a rip off. I would not buy these here."
5,not the best dubbing but it's better then reading subs lol,"I don't see what the big deal about the subs are,sure it's flat and the recording was kinda awefull and there is virtualy no chemistry between the characters ..but the animation is great and it's unedited and with all the orignal footage from do you remember love,aside from the animation in the credits,it's still worthwhile because it is in english and full screen.(:"
1,This is a bootleg,"Avoid buying this! The legitimate Japanese blu ray is about to be released and we can only hope that it comes with English subtitles. Japan and North America are in the same ""region"" for blu ray disks."
4,One of my favourites,"This movie is great! anyone who appreciates good anime (or good anything as a matter of fact!) should at least rent it. The story is great, with endearing characters, wonderful love story, beautiful charcter and mechanical design, thrilling action sequences and some of the best music to grace an anime (I defy anyone to not love the movie's theme song). Just one thing wrong, HORRIBLE DUBBING. Try finding a subtitled version. Still it's worth a try."
3,Great Movie -- Bad Dubbing,"This movie has always been one of my favorites - in subtitled format. Everything about the dubbing is poor, from the video transfer, the english dialog, and the voice acting. I'm just relieved that they didn't dub the music. The movie is definitely worth buying, especially for fans of the Robotech TV series. The animation is leagues better than the TV show and the storyline with be very familiar. However, if you can find an English subtitled version, buy that one...and let me know where to find it!"
2,A Dubbing Crime,"Tragic. Only the animation saves it. The dubbing quality is below par even compared to a stereotypical kung fu movie. The sound quality and acting are terrible. Even the original music is poorly transfered. The video transfer is below average although the art remains excellent. Even real fans (especialy real fans) will be appalled. However, it is still the only game in town unless one can find an import of the original, ""Do You Remember?"""
3,A classic worth having around.,"Okay, I admit it. The dubbing sucks. What do you expect? This movie is from 1984, no one knew how to voice act then. This film is a milestone in anime, the first of (what I feel) is one of the best sci fi groups of all time, Macross. Give credit where it's due, Shoji Kawamori (Every Macross, Vision of Escaflowne) didn't waste his time with this movie. The story is decent, the animation is good (for the time anyway), the music is pleasant. All around, this title is a worthy addition to your anime library. It sure beats the hell out of Robotech (the American redubbed version)."
3,Fantastic Animation\Extremely poor dub!,"This is a work of art. I must of seen it 5 times, and it still looks fantastic. The real let down is the dubbing: Terrible. So horrible to the point where it is not amusing. Also, there are scenes missing (the snapshots from the back of the box says it all). If you're a fan: Get it. If not: rent it out. You may find it under a different title: MACROSS clash of the bioniods."
4,Very Good for its Time!,This is a very good movie for deep Sci-fi/Anime fans.I enjoyed the story-line even though it can be weird the first time.The animation is not to great but one must consider the time it came out.The dubbing could be better but this is still a great movie!I love Misa and Hikaru's characters.Buy it today!
4,"Great, if you can stomach the horrible dubbing job.","If you're a fan of Macross, you have no excuse not to get this movie immediately. While it is in essence only a condensed version of the original animated series, it's still well worth your time. The animation is simply excellent, and every moment is a joy to look upon, from Minmay and Hikaru's time alone in the Macross to the final battle at the end. The Lynn Minmay songs are wonderful as well. Please, please, PLEASE do yourself a favor and find a subtitled version of this. The English-dubbed version is horrible, in truth the worst anime dub I've had the misfortune to stumble across. All the characters speak with a British accent and are for the most part emotionless, while the dialogue doesn't even make sense at times. There's nothing like hearing ""Beat...him...and....restore...culture."" delivered in a dead voice to kill the drama in a scene."
4,almost perfect,i call this the almost perfect edition. the quality of the picture is the best ive been able to get of this movie on dvd and the soundtrack is an addwd bonushowever the freaking karaoke english and japanese words everytime minmay sings - and i mean every. time. - distracts from this. it cant be turned off as its not a subtitlei know the original didnt have this. would be great if we could just get a high quality untouched version of this classic in the states
2,Not as good as other MD Fest....,"first thing is, this DVD is based on the VHS version of the same festival, so the sound/visual quality is just fine,and about the performance, i don't think that's as good as other MD Fest, drummers on the show are all great drummers, i know, Vinnie, Horacio, Paul, they are all great on their own, and Dave is so good with Slayer, but when he come to soloing, that's a different story, and for Don, well.... he's a legend, but how he is related to a ""best-drummers-on-the-planet"" show, i can't understand, and i'l like to see Akira playing with Casiopeia other than his electronic toys, he's play so much better in a band......"
3,sCOCK masters beware!,"May possibly be the most masterful ""nAIL UrSelf"" piece ever done. Don't pass up this inserpassable chance to plug yourself thoroughly and ""nAIL UrSelf"". Plug yourself constantly to these beats, and beat yourself constantly to these plugs. Its a mad-house in the world of DRUMS, so don't miss it."
1,DON'T GET MUCH WORSE THAN THIS,"This detestable sequel to the okay DRAGON FURY has nothing to recommend it. Robert Chapin, Mike Norris and all the so-called ""Actors"" are laughable. The fight scenes are staged like ballroom dancing, the plot is ridiculous, there is about a three minute love scene that is also laughable, a little girl with psychic powers, and a satellite poised to rule men's minds. A total waste of your time---please don't bother."
3,Nice product - HORRIBLE DIRECTIONS!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is a nice desk for children, but the instructions for assembling it are simply ridiculous - my spouse is an engineer and he finally tossed the directions and just put it together without them. TRULY UNINTELLIGIBLE INSTRUCTIONS - and I called for help - the response was that they would have to contact the buyer and see if they buyer could get better instructions from the manufacturer.... in China. Needless to say, don't buy this desk unless you can handle a challenging assembly process!!!"
1,Pure junk...,"I purchased one of these units new off of Amazon and twice it failed and had to be repaired. The unit half way through a movie would power off and would not turn back on. It appeared to be a short or heat issue and now Onkyo will not fix it and it has happend for the third time. I tried hooking up my Sony DVD player to the Onkyo reciever I bought with this DVD player but it will not recognize the digital signal. Tired it with a buddies Magnavox, same problem. So now I either fix the player out of my own pocket or buy another Onkyo if I want to use the tuner I bought. Pure junk, stay away from it."
2,Uncomfortable but functional,"These shoes work well, but are very uncomfortable. I wouldn't recommend them if you have to wear them for more than 15 or 20 minutes. I use them to practice with my daughter; they work fine for that."
3,"intriguing investigation, weaker analysis","This is typical Heyerdal of Kontiki memory. Entrepreneurial, enthusiastic, hyperactive, resourceful, but not necessarily on the mark when it comes to conclusions.He spent considerable time in the Maldives, which is commendable. In a state that does not allow any symbols of religions other than Islam to be displayed (I have seen little Buddhas being confiscated at the airport) he was able to persuade the president to allow for diggings in Buddhist sites and most of that stuff is now on display at the Male museum. This alone justifies buying the book.However his conclusions about the role of Hinduism and Buddhism in pre-Islam Maldives are less than watertight, just as his conclusions after the Kontiki expeditions were. He pretty much acknowledges as much at the very end of the book. Finally, he also spends too many pages writing about himself."
1,It was not at all what I wanted/needed,It was not at all what I wanted/needed as it didn't have any instructions on how to use the charts.
1,pendulum charts,Lots od charts with no instruction for the beginner to know how to use them! I would not purchase again. This geared more for advanced dowsers.
1,off to the book exchange,"Dr.Dean espouses many of his own unverifed claims (black incarceration rate among others) with highly questionable data while bashing others that he tends to disagree with. While it is at times an entertaining read his own agenda comes through not based on science, but of his own opinion of things. Look elsewhere to spend your hard earned dollar."
4,this game rocks,"This game rocks. This game was a little harder than I expected. But most of all I think it was really cool.In this game you can put make-up on, make your own t-shirts, buy outfits, rollerblade, talk to people, and make your own posters. I recommend this game to any Bratz fan."
3,Bratz game,I gave as x-mas gift so I can't say if it functioned properly and have not received follow-up considering the child I gave it to did not have the system to play it on (my mistake)
4,It Needs A Guage,"I bought this same item after years of use of the old one. Everything was the same on the new one except there was no guage so you could tell when to recharge the battery. I would rather pay more money to get all the features available on the old one rather then paying almost the same price for the replacement. However, it is such a great shave, I would buy it again."
1,Still haven't gotten it to work!,"I received this ""wet"" salt mill two years ago for Christmas and have worked and worked to get salt out but never got any! I have their regular salt mill and love it, so thought there must be some mysterious way to get this one to work. I even contact Peugeot and tried all the things they suggested and still nothing! A friend told me it was worthless but I thought he probably simply was not doing something right. Now I agree -- it is worthless!"
1,Low Sodium Wet Salt Mill,This item is a complete waste of money. Grind away and all you will get is a sore wrist. Might be just the ticket for someone that needs to cut ALL of the salt from their diet.
5,a beautiful table,this product was great my table was made with all cedar planks then finish with a spar varnish and waxed easy to sit down and get up from the table
4,Good buy ....,"Bought the table frame...bought the wood. It went together pretty easily, but recommend another person to help. Overall it is a sturdy product but a bit expensive."
4,Easy to Build,The bench was easy to build and all the screws needed are included in this purchase. I didn't like going out to buy the wood for the bench but it is what I got myself into. Once I had all the necessary wood and building materials it was simple and assembly took about 3 hours. It looks great.
4,Table maintenance,This is my second frame replacement on same table ...Its a great way to maintain an outdoor table at reasonable cost.
4,Jack Post Corp FC-30 RND Picnic Table Frame,"The two picnic table frames arrived with some damage to the box. One was missing the baggy of hardware (screws, bolts and nuts). Luckily I was able to able to replace the missing hardware.The tables turned out fantastic! Heavy duty and very sturdy!"
3,Satisfactory for the Price,"After spending time at a state park, with the heavy gauge galvanized picnic table frames, I ordered this one. It's not as heavy as those, more a basic stamped metal frame under the table, and thinner but lighter tubular steel legs. But, it's at least half the price of those, and comes in a smaller box, I'm sure. Setup requires your own lumber, sawing, drilling and a small amount of planning. The hardware is all very reasonable for the price, though. I'd recommend this for a backyard with light to typical use, NOT if you have kids that will be using it as a bmx ramp or whatever. You might want to spend the extra money at that point. But, then again, it will be much easier to haul around for the mower. So, ok."
2,Buyer Beware,"My husband and I purchased 4 of these tables for our ice cream shop. This table is not as easy to put together as it may seem. After many hours of swearing and struggling we decided to return the other 3 tables. Sounds easy, right? No so much. It cost me $80 to ship them back and I am still fighting to get a refund for one of the tables. Be sure this is what you want because it will cost you much more than the $77.99 if you don't like this product."
2,Packing & Conact problems,"I ordered the picnic table and when we received the package. It was noticed that the package was opened and re-taped closed. Upon opening the package there was no hardware or instructions in the package. Therefore we were not even sure all the parts to the table frame were even there. I sent two emails through amazon.com with no response. I finally called their customer service department and they gave me the phone number to the customer service department at Ace Hardware Outlet. There I spent 18 minutes on hold only to be disconnect with out ever talking to anyone. I am currently on hold again with ace hardware outlet customer service. it has now been 8 minutes and counting. I'll let you know how things were handled once I can speak with someone in the know.Sincerely,Still Waiting"
3,Must have some kind of woodshop experience for this to work,Easy to put together this is not!!!You better have experience working with wood/ good tools etc....This is not a simple item to put together...Finally got it together after long hours and lots of help.The directions are not as clear as they could be.It's a miracle the thing is now sitting out on my lawn..Just know this when you buy it.
4,Love this curry!,"My husband and I have been asking our New York friends for years to bring us boxes of S&B Medium Hot curry when they visit because we can't find it in Richmond. So glad to know we can get it on line. We love this curry, so easy to make. I usually add carrots and onions along with the chicken, and melt the blocks of curry paste in water in the microwave so it blends better. It's also excellent in a pie, just make the receipe and put it in a baked pie crust, cover it with another pie crust and stick it in the oven for a little while."
1,Not Dance Music!!!,"Ok, let's cut right to the chase and tell it like it is; this is not a dance diva release. Anyone expecting a disc of great club tunes can just forget it. The best thing about this wannabe Stevie Nicks is the cover art. I played this disc for some friends and they begged me to turn it off. I'm not really certain who tagged Ms. Atereth as a dance artist but they were grossly misinformed or they never listened to the disc. As to the previous reviews making this sound like the arrival of a new diva, best check your definition of ""diva"". The production value on the disc is weak at best and does not flow smoothly. The entire thing comes off as amateurish New Age drivel. Stevie Nicks would bitch slap whoever is responsible for saying this artist could be her sister. Do yourself a favor and pass on this bad experience."
1,Fade Away,"The version of the song Fade Away in this album is really bad , I have the Promo CD of Fade Away ( Solasso remix, Valentin remix,Mike Rizzo remix, Johnny Budz Remix, and Tony Moran/Warren Rigg remix and are really good. if you looking for the remix XM Radio play ,( Solasso) save your money is not in this album"
5,A MUST,"Colorful & informative. If you like or love lighthouses this book should be in your collection. If you don't, buy it, place it on your coffee table (if you don't have young children) - and let others that visit your home enjoy it."
2,Missing page(s),"I bought this book as a gift for my Father-in-law, whose family were lighthouse keepers in New Hampshire. Imagine my embarassment when he told me that at least one of the NH lighthouses that is listed in the table of contents (Isle of Shoals)is missing. The entire page is AWOL!"
3,Excellent,The product is wonderful and well worth the money. I know I will be enjoying it in years to come.
3,fair to middllin' read,A good story line BUT I had trouble with a 17 year old girl from Missouri being such a cold hearted killer. This could have been a better story. Maybe the next installment will be better.
2,And the Breasts Have the Floor,"In recent years, Walmart has steadily improved the selection of bad western titles offered on its shelves. Death Rides a Chestnut Mare is definetely the silliest of the Westerns on that shelf. The plot - a 17 yearold girl well endowed with female gifts running around with a binder (oooh, she hates that binder) and a gun, killing about twenty odd men in six months while covering some five thousand miles of travel. For a while, I think Compton flirts with some serious kinky sex - during the first killing she's not wearing pants, having dropped skirt to blind the guy (yep, woman's lib for you), a gratuitious nude scene of Danielle cleaning her gun, and one scene of a naked boy prancing around for Danielle dressed as a man. So, juvenile sexuality, silly plot, unrealistic hero. I give two stars, one for each large, young, nubile breast."
5,I Love It!,"I love this book, as soon as I finished it I started it over again:) It's the best book I've read in a long time. I loved the fact that the main character was a girl!"
4,"Interesting twist to western material ,waiting for sequel","I though this was a very interesting twist to the usual western type book. Moved along well and held my attention. I'm waiting for the sequel ""The Shadow of a Noose""."
2,just a pop western,"The premise was good - female gunfighter goes after father's killers - but you'll have to accept the action with huge bag of salt. Come on, 17 year old female greenhorn gunfighter killing, by my count, 27 men in about 6 months? Why, the writer himself says John Wesley Hardin killed 31 men all his life! A gunfighter who isn't afraid, almost never misses is almost always not very exciting, probably because you know he/she is going to win all the battles. Give me a more realistic hero anytime."
2,So/so,I used this for a couple months before it shorted out and died. I liked it. These things don't last long.
5,Gets it every time,"I love, Love this Toy. This is my 3rd one. I am so happy I was able to buy it through Amazon because it is much cheaper than the store. The vibration is super strong and you can adjust the settings if you don't like strong vibrations. I have to say this is a durable toy that will hit the spot every time."
3,OK product to use,"The product is ok to get the job done. However, it could be more portable (the wire sometimes is annoying)"
5,Ritter Hits the ground running!,"Wow! Ritter has once agian raised the bar for this genre! This once ""every-guy average Joe"" has once agian descended into the mirth & mayhem of the human mind. Ritter takes what we all secertly fear & throws it into the cuisenart of his twisted mind, and with what emerges, truly shows us what could have been, and might still be. If you only watch it once, then, my friend, you have not seen it twice! With Dirty Cop 2, Ritter truly steps away from the pack & solidifies himself as the Roger Loy of this generation!!!!"
1,Stupid Movie,"I bought this for a friend of mine who simply ""had to have it"" because of several private reasons. I found it stupid."
4,Another Ustinov classic,"If you like character acting at its very finest, then watch this movie. Peter Ustinov here builds on the sly but endearing crook persona he won Oscars for in Spartacus and Topkapi. While the characters in those films are expressions of Ustinov's great abilities in making sleazy characters sympathetic, this film goes beyond the slightly over-the-top characterisations of those films to present a fully-rounded character in the context of a credible and somewhat touching love story. This is particularly remarkable because Hot Millions is a light and airy 60s caper film. The scenes between Ustinov and Maggie Smith are brilliant, exhibiting a humourous warmth all too little seen in films, and there is great comedy generated by the presence of Karl Malden and Bob Newhart. Nice score and tight direction too. In my opinion, one of the very best mainstream movies of the late 60s, and one which gives renewed pleasure on each viewing."
2,really bad investment,"I bought this laptop because I thought a Sony Vaio was top quality.--I was wrong. This computer is entirely too heavy to be considered even remotely portable. It's slow, noisy, and doesn't hold a charge. My laptop overheats constantly...I even purchased a ""chill mat"" in hopes of alleviating the problem. The computer gets so hot, it actually burnt out one of the fans in the chill pad. Also, the computer freezes constantly--I can hardly get through an essay without having to save and re-boot. Don't waste your time/money/energy!"
3,"Good for work, Bad for gaming","If you work alot at home and use the programs like Word or Access, then this is the computer for you. If you enjoy gaming then you need a different computer. The Video card cant hold up to the newer games. I tried playing Civilzation III on it, and it wouldnt even start the game.Like I said, regular programs are great on here, I make powerpoint slides all the time, and it does awesome for it.Pro's:Great screen, one of the best I've ever seen.Excellent ability to run Office ProgramMouse Pad, never had a problemWireless Card, picks up great. I just love connecting to other peoples wireless routers without them knowing.Con's:Battery, sucks, really sucks, 1hr maxUSB ports, all on one sideVideo Card, needs updatedFan is loud, it can be heard over 30 feet awayOverall: Except for gaming, this is an awesome computer. If you just want something for Work or School, then this computer is great."
3,Too loud for quiet home use,"I initially purchased the K45 to replace my home desktop. It was purchased for its brand, style and performance. However, I noticed the fan noise was too intrusive. Noise level was loud enough to make other people notice. The bulky design was also disappointing.The store had no problem exchanging K45 because it had a defective pixel in the screen as well.K45 was exchanged for FS550 which I am very happy with."
2,Went back today!,"Firstly, let me say this laptop has a great bright display and very fast processor. But it's VERY LOUD - sounded like a vacuum cleaner. Battery power was barely over 1 hour, it's very heavy and the AC adapter was way too short...Too bad i had to pay a 15% restocking fee to find all this out."
4,Best Big Sandy by far!,"Having seen Big Sandy play live too many times to count, I enjoy his performances but his recorded material has always been boring for me. This re-issue of one of his first records is a pleasant surprise as it sounds nothing like anything he has recorded in the past 5-6 years. The songs are more rockin' and less ""western swing"" than his recent songs. Some of the songs just flat out don't sound like Big Sandy, which is a compliment and a good thing. This is a great CD for those who have always appreciated Robert's talent but wanted something a bit more rocking and edgier...well, this is it!"
3,Not as enjoyable as the other Paula Quinn books I've read,"Lord of desire was worth reading but for me it was lacking in adventure. I enjoyed the scene when Brynnar takes Brand to her favorite childhood spot over looking the ocean. While I did like the angry heated encounters between them and how that fueled their passions, I think there where far too many of those types of scenes and far too little of the more adventureous scene on the cliff over looking the ocean. I got the jist of what Paula Quinn was trying to convey, the difficulties of getting a man who had lost his true love to get over her and love you, I just think she may have taken it a little too far."
2,"good story, but...","The story is entertaining and enjoyable, but the reviewer who called it ""historically accurate"" was, to say the least, mistaken. The setting and characters bear as much resemblance to pre-Conquest England as they do to the dark side of the moon (but then, some romance writers are long on plot and really short on research)."
3,Just OK....,"This is a perfect candidate for a 3 star rating in my opinion. I did get through it, and enjoyed parts of it, but it did not leave a lasting impression on me. It is definitely not a keeper and I would recommend borrowing it from the library rather than purchasing it.Brand ""the passionate"" Risande has been burned by love. His fiancee was caught ""in the act"" with one of his good friends and his heart has been burned and sealed off ever since.When he is forced to wed Brynna in order to avoid war, he resists loving her, but because this is a romance novel, does not succeed. I did like the characters, but the storyline of Brand being so in love with the other woman and then to top it off by having her show up towards the end of the book was not what I hope for in a romance novel. His obsession with the other woman and Brynna's determination to ""win him over"" proved to much for me. I did like it enough to try Lord of Seduction, but not enough to remember Lord of Desire for any length of time."
1,Not really as advertised.,"This is a nice product and seems to be well made, but it was advertised as fitting around pipes under sinks. This isn't really the case. I thought that the sides and back would be assembled separately so that I could work it around the pipes, but it is one solid piece. I was unable to use it as planned. Make sure that you have no pipes in the way and it would work fine."
4,Very funny !!,"This book has no pretension to be a classic but it is very funny. McGinniss manages to involve the reader in the story and the characters, a struggling team of soccer players in a small Italian town who manage to temporarily advance in the national ranking. The depiction of the Italian lifestyle and personalities is very amusing. McGinniss inserts himself in the life of the town and becomes a consultant to the team, even if his advice is not always sollicited. The book loses some of its light-heartedness due to some events in the end (can't give it away) but I highly recommend it to anyone who likes Italy or Italians or soccer."
4,You don't have to be a tifoso to appreciate this book!,"Joe McGiniss has done it again. After a controversial apraisal of Alaska after a one winter visit and a lawsuit with Dr. McDaonald over a murder case, McGiniss has gone up against the Mafiosi of Naples. Long life to you Joe. The book captures the true spirit of the Abruzzese better than any other book I have seen including Luigi Barzini's ITALIANS. Only incidentaly does it capture Italian calcio (soccer)."
3,great book ruined by lack of objectivity by the author,"A truly great story of a small city, their soccer team and how they pulled off the impossible dream of playing in Serie B. The author seemed to stretch his story with all the translations of Italian. While I speak Italian, I found the translations detracted from the reading. The passages should have been in English to begin with. McGinnis steps over the line as an observer when he begins to believe he is a soccer expert and starts to advise the coach on line-ups. And then he ruins the book by playing GOD by using his morals and beliefs to judge a situation all too common in Italy. He turns a year of hard-won friendship into ashes in the mouth. He goes from being a reporter to a pariah - not only in the eyes of the town of Castel di Sangro and the soccer team, but in mine also. Another American trying to dictate behavior all over the world. Will we ever stop?"
3,An entertaining story by an arrogant author,"Mr McGinness tells a lively, entertaining and funny story and tells it very well. Along the way the reader learns alot about the Italian people in general and the game they love in particular (soccer/calcio). Unfortunately the author's arrogance (personal and cultural) gets in the way in the opening pages as he arrives in Italy without competence in the language. Then it gets worse as he assumes he has become an expert in calcio and finally evolves into a pre-adolescent debacle of petulance when he finds his heroes have feet of clay. He would have been well-served even by a small amount of humility and introspection. That said, I read the book in two days and thouroughly enjoyed about 80% of it."
3,The Miracle o f Castel di Sangro,"As a lifelong player and follower of soccer, I must admit that it was difficult to put this book down. In the first chapters, however, I found myself seriously second-guessing the author's professed instantaneous love for the game and certainly his tone of authority-in that regard, I have to agree with reviewers who disliked McGinniss' attempts at advising the manager, Jaconi. (Tactically, for example, I can't imagine any reason why the author would understand the implications of various formation changes). In the end, however, I would *strongly* recommend the book to any soccer fan or player (even younger ones)--I learned a lot about professional soccer in Italy, and the ""cameo"" appearances of Lalas and Baggio were amusing."
5,Astounding ... breathtaking,"It's sad that this book won't be as popular as it should be because some people will only see McGinness as an ""ugly American,"" yet many Americans won't understand the obsession with soccer!I'd suggest that many of the negative reviews came from readers who didn't finish the book or shrugged off the shocking conclusion. (Heaven help you if you are NOT shocked!) McGinness' conversations with Jaconi are comical -- no different than what many obsessed fans in any sport in any country would do given the access he has.Ultimately, this book has little to do with soccer and everything to do with life. To say you can't put the book down is an understatement. It is a compelling tale of triumph and tragedy stranger than the strangest fiction, and written with brilliant wit.And yes, Joe, we all wish it could have ended differently."
1,American Arrogance,"Although the book purports to speak to a year in the life of an Italian football team, it rather highlights typical American arrogance. This book is more telling about the author than anything else. As an author covering the team he thrusts himself as a knoweldgable member of the football community 9although clearly a novice). His arrogance in the manner of interacting with the team, as described in the book, is insulting. I would not recommend this book to anyone, regardless of their interest in football, or Joe McGinnis."
3,"Good, but not great","I am not a soccer fan; I merely play soccer recreationally. I enjoyed the book, it was well-written, exciting and full of emotional turmoil. I felt as though I was on the journey with McGinnis. However, I found irritating McGinniss's personal intrusion in both the events around him and in the book itself. First, his interactions with those people in whose lives he was a guest could be both shameful, embarassing and beyond presumptuous. Second, his failure to intuit the fact that his behavior was at times disgraceful and entirely inappropriate brought an unpleasant element to the book. He displayed a typical American inability to control the force of his personality.Despite my misgivings, I would recommend the book to anyone who enjoys nonfiction."
1,A year in the life of Joe McGinniss,Agree entirely with the previous review. A good tale spoilt by a self-indulgent author.
2,Great Story ruined by annoying author,"The actual story that is supposed to be told would have been a great story. However, the arrogance and poor writing style of the author made me cringe every time I turned the page. The fact that the story about the unlikely successes of a team turned into a story about the author's 9 month vacation in Italy was a shame. This must be the first book I've ever read where I literally couldn't stand the author and the only thing that got me through the book was the underlying tale of this incredible soccer team."
4,Joe don't know calcio . . .,"Like previous posters, I found myself engaged by the moving, funny and emotional story that McG tells. I found, however, McG's self-righteousness to be unbearable and a distraction to the great story that he tells. His ""suggestions"" to the alenatore were unbelievable given that he studied the sport for less than four years, and his inclusion of his told-you-so opinions made his book much, much worse than it could have been.I also think it's amusing that Joe references a Lazio farm player as a ""romanista,"" which means a fan of Roma, instead of a ""romano,"" resident of Roma. That may sound too nit-picky, but Joe clearly acts as if he knows the game well -- and nobody who is a serious Serie A fan would ever make that mistake.Still, criticisms aside, the story was AMAZING. It's worth reading because of Joe's access to players and an incredible town. If only he had shown a little less hubris . . ."
3,"Italy, not soccer, is the subject","This book is an engaging look at a small town in Italy and their passion for soccer with an overachieving minor league team. The story is well written, but McGiniss often misses the point and conveys a self righteous American view of his beloved team. I would recommend this book to anyone fascinated with European life. It reminded me of my own experieces in Europe some time ago."
4,italian balls,great and easy read...went beyond football. It shed light on several historical facts as well as politics.
5,Extraordinary and mistreated,"I read no book reviews, saw no interviews, and saw no ads for this book. It's quiet, unassuming cover has little to nothing to do with the content. And yet, when I started reading, I fell in love with this book. I could not put it down. My wife, daughter and I spent several weeks travelling around Italy this summer. I discovered this book upon my return and it immediately made me sick to return to Italy. The book is as much about Italians and their society as it is about soccer. WHY WAS IT NOT MARKETED BETTER? This book shoudl be a best seller."
3,Great Story; Greatly Flawed Book,"The story of the Miracle of Castel di Sangro is an unbelievably rich one, with characters and events almost too good to be true. However, that story is ruined by egotism of the author. He inserts himself into the story on every occasion. Events that you would like to hear more about are presented as just an aside to a story that focuses on his actions and heroism. I do not buy into the notion that this was a literary device used to show his delving into madness over the team; it is distracting and very unattractive.If you have interest in soccer or Italian culture, the story alone makes it a worthwhile read. Just be prepared to endure long, drawn-out, personal diatribes of the narcissistic author."
5,Like Jack Higgins,I have read Jack Higgins for years. Always like his books. They are fictional but full of historical facts. Good stuff.
4,The Savage Day,I always enjoy his books and this one was no exception. Has a good twist at the end and some sad parts but a really good read.
3,good,Was an interesting . Enjoy his writing.. Most of his work is most enjoyable. That is all I can say for now.
3,"Frozen Ghost's Debut Notable for ""Should I See""","Frozen Ghost's Arnold Lanni and Wolf Hassel were one half of the band Sheriff, whose 1983 song ""When I'm with You"" recharted and hit #1 six years later in 1989. ""Should I See,"" the only Frozen Ghost single to make Billboard's Hot 100, wasn't a big chart hit; but radio was still playing the song in 1989, when I first heard it. After the excellent Shake Your Spirit (1991) went largely unnoticed, Frozen Ghost disbanded. Lanni occasionally surfaces as a producer, working with some of Canada's most promising young rock bands."
4,Great Undiscovered 80's Band,"I remember ""Should I See"" coming on the radio and people saying, ""What a great new Fixx song - they're really rocking!"" I think Frozen Ghost picked up on some of the strengths of the Fixx but avoided their self-aggrandisement and obscure lyrics. Unfortunately, even ""Should I See"" barely did much in the U.S., as far as I know (I was in the Northeast and rarely heard it).The album is really strong, though, which a number of songs (as others have said) that are close to, or as good as, the first single. I happen to REALLY love ""Love Like Fire"", which I think has great lyrics and a haunting melody. In general, most of the songs have strong hooks and are very catchy. I used to listen to this quite a lot but have forgotten it for a while now. My new iPod is helping me rediscover some gems like Frozen Ghost, and I highly recommend them to people who like 80's new wave and alterna-pop."
5,GRAMMY NOMINATED !,"Green Gorilla, Monster and Me has been nominated for a GRAMMY! Really, its that good! You gotta buy this one, Jack! Kids like King Kong? They'll like Green Gorilla!"
5,Very fun!,My kids (ages 2 1/2 and 12 months) and I really enjoy this CD. We've had it for a month now and listen to it every day. It's fun to dance to and sing along with.
5,"Green Gorilla, My Son, and me!","This is a great CD. Ralph doesn't disappoint, and my son just loves it. It beats a lot of the other kids stuff I endure on the commute in to school and work. This is a good one to add to your Ralph collection or a worthy one to start getting to know Ralph's World."
4,Good - but not great,"This is a good CD - love all but 2 songs (""Liesl Echo"" is pretty slow and brings our silliness to a halt...and ""I Don't Wanna"" makes me fear that ideas of bad behavior will be planted in my kid's brains). Still - it's in-line with other Ralph's World CD's...genuinely fun and silly, and catchy enough to engage parents in the fun of dancing and singing along. We especially like the ""Tarzan"" song...great lyrics! We also love his other CD, ""Happy Lemons""...every song is a gem!"
4,Important Information to Know,I purchased this film to gather information on nursing homes. There is too much information out there and takes too much time to find. This tape provides a nice overview and it breaks down the topics so its easy to follow and understand. I like the fact that it differentiates between the different type of nursing homes and discusses how they should be paid. This tape points people who need this information to the right direction.
4,A Must Have Information For The Elderly And Their Children,"When it comes to placing a loved one in a nursing home, many families are sad, stressed out, and often confused. Currently, on the news there are many debates on the needs of the aging population. This video sheds light on this time consuming and complicated issue. It sets easy to follow guidlines and teaches people to keep their eyes and ears open by asking the right questions on their tour. It covers and clarifies the essential points that people should know."
2,Hackneyed,"I picked this up at a used book store thinking it would be diverting and fun. I had hopes, albeit not large ones, that it would also use the amusement to illuminate greater truths. Instead, it is superficial and unrealistic. The crazy people are caricatures, so immensely insane that they stop resembling human beings. No one can relate to that. The doctor is also a shadow of a doctor, lacking in humanity.Meanwhile, it's not funny. If it was funny, there would be a redeeming quality to the book, short and humorous. I haven't laughed yet."
4,Prot (Mr. Hyde) is not hidden!,"This book helps complete the story begun in K-PAX, but the narrator is becoming too wooden and predictable - much like the skeptical characters one finds in THE X-FILES. Having a foil to the phenomena on hand can seem plausible only so long.Nevertheless, the story is great fun, and one must hand it to Dr. Gene Brewer for his skill at interweaving psychology and science-fiction in an odd and entertaining fashion that never delves into the bathic, but keeps the reader thirsting for more contact with the protagonist - whoever he may be."
1,Incompatible w/ our workout room,"Our workout room is also the playroom. Our DVD player is a PS3. This DVD won't play on a PS3. Looking at reviews of this DVD and others from the same series, it looks like this is a flaw in the DVD."
5,No More Fear of the Dark,"A delightful journey with a young, lonely boy who lives only in the light because of his fear of the dark. He meets a young girl that shows him the beauty and magic of the dark, along with all the creatures that live in the dark. He learns that he has a choice to 'turn on' the light or the dark."
4,I wish I had this book as a child.,As a child I was always terrified of the dark. I know it is a very common problem with children but I believe my case was a little more serious. To this day I have to sleep with the lights on if I'm alone and even when someone is with me I still get goosebumps. I wish I had this book when I was a kid to help me realize there is nothing to be afraid of. Beautiful illustrations and anything by Ray Bradbury is sure to please.
4,Switch on the Nignt,Great book for thinking about being scared of the dark or focusing on the sense of vision.
1,Disappointed,"Charlie obviously lacks his brothers talent for singing and songwriting. His song have no flow and don't seem to go anywhere. The one bright spot on this album the entertaining ""The best that I can do"" was penned by his brother Bruce."
5,EXCELLENT CD EXCELLENT LYRICS EXCELLENT CHARLIE !,TRUE TEXAS HONKY TONK BLUES . CHARLIE ROBINSON IS A CROSS BETWEEN GRAM PARSONS- ROBERT EARLE KEENE- AND A LITTLE BOB DYLAN.REAL AMERICANA MUSIC FROM BEGINNING TO END.
2,Everybody needs a little Charlie Robison,"Everybody needs a little Charlie Robison -- to make you laugh and cry and spill beer on yourself for one reason or another.He gets better with age. If you're only going to buy one Robison CD, hold out for ""Live"" (four stars) or ""Live Unchained"" (five stars).This one is an early work and of interest to Robisonophiles, but the rest of us can hear the same songs played better on his more mature albums."
4,Rocking Texas Honky Tonk,"A little bit of Steve Earle (""Loving County"", ""My Hometown""), a little bit of John Prine (""Indianola""), and a little bit of your Texas guys like Jack Ingram and Ray Wylie Hubbard add up to Charlie Robison. Great songwriting--""Indianola"" is a damn near masterpiece-- and songs, like ""Barlight"", that are mainstream enough to be all over the radio (but of course won't be). This is not alt-country, but good, strong, hard rocking Texas honky tonk. Docked one star for being married to one of the Dixie Chicks."
1,"NO to Vol.2, but YES to Vol.1!!!","This item was a HUGE disappointment after listening to Vol.1!!! Do not waste your time and money on hunting this rare piece of junk for the sake of collecting both volumes! On the contrary, I consider Vol.1 to be a state of the art release and one of my 10 most favorite releases (alongside with all versions of ""Blade Runner"" by Vangelis, ""the Fifth Element"" by Eric Serra, ""Older"" by George Michael, ""Emergency on Planet Earth"" by Jamiroquai, ""23am"" by Robert Miles, ""Another World"" by Astral Projection, ""Sunday 8pm"" by Faithless, ""Out There and Back"" by Paul van Dyk, etc.)! Vol.1 is definitely a must have for all the Science Fiction fans and great for playing while reading S. Lem, A. Asimov, R. Bradbury, or H. Harrison to your friends or children... it maximizes the effect and makes people fall in love with literature on a whole other level!!!!!All in all, make sure you get Vol.1 instead of this junk!"
3,Wanted to give it a 4,"This is a dreamy almost stream of concouncous 'longish' short. Much of the charicterization here is done through body launguage and complex facial expresion. This film isn't for everyone, but if you want to see what very good acting and directing, a mimimalist script, all combined with wizardly film work can achieve on a zero budget, then this is the art house film for you. Don't expect gore, do expect charicters that make you want to know more about them. Vampire slice of life."
5,Touchstone,"I have been listening to William Ellwood since the late 1980's. I have all of his selections and enjoy each and every one. Touchstone is another great recording by a very talanted and emotional artist. Although Closely associated to New Age music I feel William Ellwood separates himself from the sappy stigma New Age Music is labled with. Ellwood's CD's are a descriptive story told by his acoustic and ensamble abilities. They do just that, tell a story. If you are looking for more than background music and want to drift away and reflect don't miss this opportunity. I would highly recommend his other selections. On Touchstone, Dakota is my favorite selecion. Take a listen and enjoy."
4,Good mid 70's jazz-rock-funk,This is a great example of fusion from the mid 70's- heavy on the rock and funk with splashes of latin. This guy actually wrote songs and not just jams avoiding the wankery that fusion from this period sometimes had. This guy is truly funky.
