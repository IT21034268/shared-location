4,Good Quality + Affordable,"Ok... Ask yourself one question before you buy these speakers. Am I an audiophile? If you answer ""Yes"" or if you have a subscription to ""The Absolute Sound"", then keep looking. For the rest of us, these are really good speakers. If you're looking (as I was) for moderately priced, good sounding, in-wall, paintable-grilled speakers then this is a solid choice. For a retrofit into a smaller room, I'd suggest the 6"" speaker instead of the 8"". Also, if you're doing a whole-house audio thing on a budget (as I am), then you can save $$ and effort by buying the ""dual voice coil"" model which accepts both the left and right channel into one speaker. Not as good as separates, but you only pull one 4-wire cable and drill one hole into your drywall. 5 stars minus one to aknowledge my audiophile brothers and sisters who know their stuff about high quality sound."
2,dont buy it,"I bought this because I wanted my chinchilla to have calcium. It is basically made of cereal which is bad for chinchillas. He doesn't like it much and the directions are wrong. It says to keep a stick inside the cage at all times which they will eat it and get fat because of the sugary cereal. I highly highly highly recommend you buy a ten dollar ""Chinchilla feisty fusion"" from Forever Feisty chinchilla rescue instead. He LOVES the herbs so much and theyre very healthy for him. These calcium sticks are crap processed treats. It's not even resealable and who knows what they used to make it long lasting."
4,very helpful,"gave lots of new ""tricks"" to meeting people. Some that are so obvious, I don't know why I wasn't doing it before Dr. Judy wrote about it!"
3,The book is well worth reading,"I found the book to be enjoyable reading when I purchased it on a recent trip to North America. Dr. Kuriansky's approaches aren't bad at all and the book had a lot of humourous points as well. The part that I wasn't keen on was that it overly stressed heterosexual dating and very, very little on homosexual dating mentioned. Gays feel the same as straights in many ways with regard to dating, yet there are some differences. In future editions of this book it might be a good idea to include a section for gays and lesbians."
2,little helpful,"This book is very little helpful, because it really doesn't tell you more than everybody already knows. Look your best,, be confident,, it really doesn't tell you what everybody looking for someone wants to know,,, when you walk up to someone you are interested in,, WHAT DO YOU SAY? It does give you a list of really played out pickup lines that nobody should use, but nowhere does it tell you what you should say. Anyway,, being ""dateable"""" only depends on your genetic looks anyway."
2,Don't bother!,"I got this as a gift from someone who'd never read it (if he had read it and had given it to me anyway, I would have killed him)...the first clue to how bad it is is in the little tear-out cards in the front that say ""Name, weight, height, how we met,etc."" to give out to prospective dates. Are they serious? The rest of the book is similarly ridiculous. It's good for a laugh if nothing else."
4,Complete Idiots Guide to Dating,"This is a good resource for beginners dating tips. It covers almost the same material as the dating guide in the `Dummies' series. Both cover fundamental work (such as self-esteem) and then go into the mechanics of flirting, asking out etc. In other words, for a dating novice or someone who has trouble with successful dating and relationships, this book can be an excellent source of information. Since the material covered by this book and the dummies brand version is essentially the same, just buy the one you feel most comfortable with. The best reason for buying one of these books (Idiots or Dummies guides) is that you don't have to read it from beginning to end to use it effectively. Just pick a chapter or section and read through the tips and try them out."
2,Trite and Superficial,"There isn't much depth to this gloss. Perhaps the picture of the author on the book's cover, taken as she hosts her radio talk show, gives the best indication of the book's quality: not much is inside that cover that could be considered insightful, thoughtful, or helpful. Just a lot of trite superficialities that do little to explain the intricacies of male/female interaction. For example, the role of eye contact is acknowledged to be ""powerful,"" but only three paragraphs are spent on the subject. Don't expect much above the level of the average call-in radio show, or to discover anything you don't already know."
1,DON'T BUY THIS BOOK ! ! !,"i have no idea what world dr. kuriansky lives in. if you do the things the book tells you to do, girls will think you're a major dork, and you will be doomed to failure! the truth of the matter is, dating is a game. and kuriansky does not address any of this game. she even says not to play any of the dating game. well, i learned the hard way...a really really hard way. trust me, dating is a game, which even nice sincere girls will respond to, so buy a book that actually addresses this. i won't suggest any book, because then people might think this review is a fake. but check out the other dating games on amazon.com and read the reviews. and look for books that addresses the dating game. by the way, i'd like to thank you dr. kuriansky, for ruining my recent dating experience."
2,how to be a jerk,I had the good fortune to thumb through this in a bookstore. (Saved me from buying it.) There may be some good stuff in here but you'll waste a lot of time sifting through lame advise. I must admit that the book taught me a *very* important point: I looked up the section on 'pick-up lines' The lines in here are *so bad* it turned me off to the whole concept. I quickly saw how innane one can be when avoiding authenticity. This book seems to emphasize retaining one's low self-esteem and trying to trick someone into liking you. (What a load!) Better to take the risk and be real. On the other hand I went cover-to-cover on Nina Atwood's book and found it accessible and comprehensive -- emphasizing personal-growth and finding someone with whom you'd actually want to be in a long-term relationship. Nina's book is at: href=http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0805040978/7694-5374857-919139
3,Out of my trunk from 1950 by Berle,"well i just got the latest Milton Berle book in my collection. it is very used and not in great shape. no dust jacket and the books cover boards are torn, the pages are all yellowed with age. I however want this book, to read and not to show off. If I like it, I will get another copy. The last Berle book that I got was his Joke File...and it is the very best joke book that I have ever read. I have his autobiography, but have yet to read it. I always found his humor on tv rather over bearing, but he has gathered the very greatest joke book and a second volume. So I have high hopes. The illustrations are good, and I could use a good funny book right now."
4,Music for Meditation,This is a great CD for quiet listening. It helps you focus in preparation for prayer or meditation. The first track - O Lord Hear my Prayer becomes powerful as you play it over and over. The rest of the CD is also a joy to hear.
5,If only Mercy was the Energizer Bunny...,The only thing I truly didn't like about this book was the ending. Because it ended. If only it kept going and going and going...
3,Not her best but worth reading,"I must say this was not one Ms. Garwood's best books. I am an avid reader of her work. I have read all of her books at least once. I was not thrilled when she started writting contemporary novels, but gave Heartbreaker a shot and LOVED it. However, I must say Mercy was not as good. I like Ms. Garwood's new books but still hold the hope that she will also write a historical romance every once in a while."
1,Brainless Heroine! Brainless Hero! Brainless Book!,"I leafed through this book and it's beginning was great; everything went down hill after I paid for it. The characters became so old and so clich√© just like all the other ones I'd read. The heroine has to be the stupidest thing since the first fiction writer ever scratched charcoal on a stone wall. I tell you if girls were easy as she was; it would be good to be a man!!! On top of that all the internal dialogue with the heroine and hero only proves that they are both the stupidest human beings ever to have a brain. They change their minds every single line, and with all the slashing around I get to feeling like I'm in a washing machine!!"
3,Not one of her best.,"I have read a lot of Julie Garwood's books, however, this is not the best one. Sizzle was much better."
2,Clever premise gone wrong,"The Sowing Club idea is clever, but the romance between ""Mike"" and Theo was lame and lacked Garwood's trademark chemistry. It was almost like she was writing two different stories and they were just bound into one book. Frankly, I've found myself skimming this author's contemporary novels and will be hard pressed to spend money on another one."
3,I have read two Garwood books and both were very similiar. Predictable.,"Even though the themes were similiar and have some of the same charactars (from same family), I did enjoy reading the books."
3,Sorry Julie,"I thought long and hard about what I should write. I review what others had said. Julie I'm begging you to at least write one or two Historicals mixed in with contempoary. I'm find that most of my beloved romance writers are taking a stab at mystery. I must say that so far I have not been overly impressed. I really, really loved your historicals. I understand the need to branch out but many of your fans would love to see you write at least some historicals. I really want to see a sequel to ""THE WEDDING"". I think that Quinlan and Faith need a story."
2,Garwood Cashes In,"Like many of her more successful predecessors, Julie Garwood is beginning to rest a little too heavily on her laurels - and the marketing skills of her publishing company.Okay, we've never been talking Faulkner, here; but Ms Garwood could always be depended upon to deliver reasonably well written, funny, and sometimes touching, romantic fiction to those of us who wanted a bit of intelligence with our escapism. This book, like its contemporary predecessor, reads as if she wrote it while balancing her checkbook. Little humor, little character development, little fun.Ms. Garwood, go back to your roots, take your time with your writing, and quit anticipating your advance checks. With the lousy product that you've been producing recently, they may dry up sooner than you anticipate."
2,My Last...,"I'm thinking ""Mercy"" may just be the last Garwood book I read...unless someone can recommend one that can change my mind. The beginning was great, but towards the middle it just got way to unbelievable, yes... everything I read in truth is unbelievable and doesn't really ""happen"" but that to me is where the writer comes in and makes it very possible... Garwood didn't do that for me."
5,Excellent!,"I found myself engrossed in this mystery thriller from start to finish. I couldn't put it down, in fact, reading to 3am. The storyline was exceptional and refreshing."
5,Wonderful!!!,"This book is wonderful! The only thing I would change is the ending. I would have liked knowing exactly what happened to John and Monk, but overall Julie Garwood out did herself with this one. I loved the humor! Hope to see one soon about Noah."
5,whoooaaa...,"To me, this is one of the best second success [this is Garwood's second contemporary novel]. Not many authors can cross and make their second novels one of their bests - this is a big exception. MERCY was an excellent read and I am anxiously waiting for the next novel.While I'm not going to review this, I will say that it was fast-paced, and that any who like romance or suspense will like this book."
5,She's done it again!,"Julie Garwood has effectively delivered another romance and thriller after Heartbreaker! While The Heartbreaker was action and romance from the get go, this one started a little slower but once it picked it's pace, there was no stopping it. Mercy has a very well developed story line and characters you will love, along with the romance and excellent dialogues that you would expect from a Garwood novel. I love the Buchanon family and can't wait to read more!"
2,Mercy (Julie GarwoodO,"I have been a fan of Julie Garwood for years and have thoroughly enjoyed all her previous books. Her past books have had plots and characters that kept you reading until you finished the book. Mercy lacked the usual Garwood flair and was a ""ho-hum"" book. Will probably not buy another."
3,Not her best,"I have been a Julie Garwood fan ever since I read 'The Gift'. After that I bought all of her books. I especially liked the medieval ones (The Bride, The Prize). Heartbreaker was a good book, I really liked it. But MERCY is a bit disappointing. It is still quite good, but not for me. I do not think I will buy a contemporary of Ms. Garwood in hardcover again. Sorry...."
4,An entertaining book,"I can't say what was better, Heartbreaker or Mercy. They were both good books. I really liked the characters Theo & Michelle but I think Ms. Garwood went a little too far with the residence of Bowen. Also, the final hospital scene, well... But then I think Ms. Garwood blew it with the church scene at the end of Heartbreaker. While the book is supposed to be suspenseful it should also be believable. Still, it's worth the price of a hardback and, if Garwood plans on a trilogy I would like to see Noah as the next hero."
1,1 star for effort,please be real this book was one the the worst books I have ever read for an author of [a] high standard. I was truly a devoted fan collecting and reading every book u have published. [The] old books were magic. What Happened too the magic please bring it back...
1,Wish I'd Listened...,"...to the readers who rated this book 1 star. I love Ms. Garwood's historicals, but this book was unreadable. Very slow pacing, repetitive, and way too many plot inconsistencies. Disappointing."
3,Slight Disappointment,"As a longtime fan of Julie Garwood, who especially adored her Regency England espionage series, I enjoyed ""Mercy"" but wished it had more depth. Theo is one sexy and smart leading man, which made for a great read, but I was disappointed with his leading lady Michelle, who seemed more clinical than passionately loving. I was also disappointed by the casual attitudes both characters took about sex, as was also done in the recent ""Heartbreaker"" book. Julie's historical novels were centered much more on falling in love and making love with emotion and caring rather than instant physical satisfaction that later leads to some kind of regret or pain. I sincerely hope this trend will not continue in her writing -- entering the modern-day genre does not mean she has to bow to the most liberal views on sexuality which, contrary to popular belief in the literary world, do not dominate every aspect of American society."
2,"I have to say, it WAS boring...","I love this author and in deference to her I tried to read this book twice but could find little to hold my interest. I did finish it the 2nd time in order to give a fair review and I'm sorry to say, there's no other word for it, it was 'boring.'And why someone with such a lovely name as Michelle would want to be called 'Mike' is beyond me.This book had such potential but fell far short of being interesting, having any sort of intrigue, or conveying any attraction to the characters, which was amazing considering the talent of the author."
1,I COULD NOT FINISH IT............ DID NOT LIKE,I PREFER GARWOOD'S HISTORICAL NOVELS AND DID NOT LIKE ANY PART OF THIS ONE. EVEN SKIPPED AFTER 3/4 FINISHING TO THE END AND STILL DID NOT CARE. IT DID NOT HOLD MY ATTENTION.
1,Cartoon Characters,I can't imagine how this book was ever published. The author can't write. Her characters are one-dimensional cliches. The plot is thin and ridiculous. You would get more enjoyment for your money if you simply burned it. This book is a total waste.
4,Good Book,"Mercy starts rather slow. About 100 pages in, I was pretty bored. I was beginning to wonder if the entire book would be dominated by one dimensional evil characters whose only motivation was greed. Fortunately, things began to pick up. The good characters are far more interesting than the bad ones. There were a few surprises. The pace (after the first 100 or so pages) is good. It was funny as always with Mrs. Garwood. The ending was a tad predictable and a bit unsatisfactory in certain aspects but it did have Mrs. Garwood's flair for the dramatic. Good book. I would read it again."
4,Loved It,Dr. Mike is awesome. I look forward to the other stories on the Buchannan clan. I am glad Nick and Lauren where mentioned. Although I would have loved to have seen more of them in this book - Julie cleaned it up with the time line (Nick & Laurens wedding).Great read - you will NOT be disappointed. Oh and there is an AWESOME Twist! Hope this helps. Can't wait for the next book!
5,Good Follow Up,"This book is a follow up to her last novel ""Heartbreaker"". In ""Mercy"" Garwood brings back Nick's brother, Theo Buchanan, who holds an esteem position with the U.S. Justice Department. He falls ill at a party, and literally falls into the arms of Dr. Michelle ""Mike"" Renard. It does have the feel of the Florence Nightengale syndrome. The book is fun. The characters are great. I hated to come to the end of this book. In this book they had a couple of stories going. They had conspiracy going on with a group of people that involved Dr. Mike. Theo comes to her rescue because he can't stop thinking about her. The book had suspense, romance, and drama. I hope that she continues to write about Mike's crazy brother and Theo's FBI friend in a future book."
4,What a great book!,"I enjoyed reading Heartbreaker, Ms. Garwood's first contemporary, but with Mercy, she has really hit her stride. This was a very good book, with excellent pacing and great suspense. I recommend it highly."
4,Mercy,"I enjoyed Mercy, it is the best of the contemporary outings Julie Garwood had attempted. Michelle and Theo are a decent couple and their meeting is comical in a good Garwood way. It's a little farfetched that the city boy would be willing to live in the swampy sticks, but his single focus on Michelle makes you go along with it and the town's involvement constantly calling him ""Coach"" despite his best efforts to deny the title are also cute. You are introduced to her brother John Paul who is written as such a bad ass it makes his own book that much more of a let down. Noah is back having great fun pestering those around him and Michelle is given character enough to hold her own with the boys.Not as good as her historicals, but worth the time to read for a change."
3,Not very powerful,This fan works ok - it's just not very powerful. If you have a large room or need to circulate a lot of air then you should keep looking.
3,fan,ya it works good but dosent really blow alot of air .i love the therm control thow overall not to bad
1,Don't Waste Your Time or Money,"At first glance this seems like a cute, simple to play toy for the Cars fanatic in your life. In reality it is a cheaply made waste of your finances. Not all the parts click into place as they should, even when they are in the right spot. I just let my kids put the parts on without the timer. Once they were finished we put the timer on and waited for parts to fly... and did they ever fly. Luckily my daughter was wearing her glasses, or she would have taken a small plastic blast to the eye. I don't recommend this toy for anyone. There are so many other good, fun Cars toys out there. Don't waste your time on this one!(Amazon deleted all other reviews of this toy. That should tell you something.)"
1,Timer too fast,I bought this for my 6 yr old for Christmas. I'm glad I got it cheap because its made cheap. The parts don't go on right and the timer runs so fast that I can't even put the parts on before they fall off. I certainly don't expect any child to put the parts on before the timer runs out. I don't recommend this.
4,Entertaining Toy,"This toy was very enjoyable for my three year old. We bought this for him for Christmas. It's one of those timed games and you have to put all the pieces on Mater before the time runs out. The only problem is, if they are not on just right even if all the pieces are on it will blow all the pieces off when time runs out. But for the price it was well worth it for entertainment value to our son."
5,Lots of fun for the price,My 5 year old boy loves this toy. He doesn't use the timer feature much but he takes it apart and puts in together and really loves watching it fall apart. He's been pulling apart and breaking his other cars for years. Glad to find something that he can do that to without breaking it.
5,Loved Disney Cars Later Mater Game,Ages 45 to a 3yr old played this game. We all had a good time. Only the 7yr.old was able to complete Mater before he blew a gasket.
4,CARS Mom,"My son is an avid CARS fan. He has all things CARS. This game is perfect for those kids. It is a fun ""Beat the clock"" type of game. However, my only complaint is that the clock is too quick. We haven't been able to put it together fast enough to avoid Mater's explosion. That is kind of frustrating. Other than that, it's fun. I would advise you to get a plastic storage container to keep Mater and all of his parts in so they don't get lost. Also note that the game is like a puzzle since the wheels go in specific holes. Once you put Mater together, he can roll around like a regular truck. Overall it is an exciting game."
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought this for my 3.5 year old daughter for Christmas and I was pretty disappointed in it! The parts don't fit well and they don't pop off like they are supposed to when the time is up. My daughter will still play with it because she loves Mater, but she basically just puts the pieces on and puts it back in the box after 5 minutes. It's a great idea, but just made pretty poorly!"
2,this toy does not work...frustrating!,"This toy does not work. The only thing that flew off was the bumper and the wheels. All the other parts did not budge...so not all 10 parts fall off. I would defintely not recommend this product...there are other, better Cars toys."
2,Poor Sound,I love Taize and the Taize form of worship but I cannot hear the words being sung on this album. I like the feel but am really disappointed in the sound quality.
3,Nothing like West Wing,"I was either mislead by the other reviews or received a strange one of a kind CD, but there is nothing on this CD that sounds at all like the song used in the West Wing."
4,cute and comfy,"I am pleased with this shoe (in black). It is cute, especially with pants or long skirts. It seems to run a little bit big, but for the price I will not complain!"
3,Energy Club Sour Gummy Worms,I purchased these because I love sour gummy worms and so my order would qualify for free shipping.These gummy worms are the most sour I've had and the sour sugar on them is thick which at times overpowers the fruit flavors.I also felt that these were a bit tough but not stale. The fruit flavors were all very enjoyable except I thought that the blue (raspberry) had a different taste to it then I am used to.This is a good quality product but doesn't suite my tastes. If you are looking for a sour gummy worm that has more sour power than Trolli brand this could be for you.
4,Perspectives worth considering,"While not an easy or fast read, the material was researched and appeared thorough. The ""Spiritual Legacy"" presents an amalgam of centuries of philosophical thought and is well worth the time to read and digest. Concise summarization with the filter of experience makes this short book a window to a wider world."
4,Dry but all the information you need,"It is what you would expect, it is how to write your Master's Thesis or your Doctoral Dissertation with step by step procedures to follow. Although it could be looked at as becoming outdated, the Dissertation, and I'm sure the Thesis, information is still relevant as well as the approaches to research. Although not a requirement, I would suggest it for those getting a first Master's or Doctorate."
5,Excellent,"This is the best review I've ever read about the process of writing a dissertation. It's clear, concise and specially honest about all the good and bad things that occurs when a person is admitted in a graduate program (master, phd or others)."
2,Just work with your committee,"I bought this book because my thesis committee chair specifically recommended it. Then he told me to change some of the basic elements of the written product which were modeled after this book. I doubt that this is a reflection of the quality of this book, but rather a reflection of the nature of thesis committees."
4,A great book,I think this book was great .The author did a wonderful job of adding history to his story. my favorite character was carrie because she was brave and snecky. she was so cool.
2,okay,"This particular product is not at all what I wanted. American Greetings no longer makes their Create-a-card line. When they did, the later editions were wonderful and very user friendly. This one, however, is a very early edition and the graphics are not as good. If you can find an edition 7 or 8 platinum, they are worth the money and lots of fun if you are a scrapbooker or a card maker."
3,"When they take away out country, they'll take away our soul.","C.W. McCall was a fairly popular country music performer in the 1970s. He ""spoke"" most of his songs, rather than singing them. He is best known for his smash crossover hit, ""Convoy"". In 1990, he released an album of re-recorded versions of some of his songs, plus one new song (the great ""Comin' Back For More""). Unfortuntely, McCall chose to record more of his serious songs than his comedy songs, and I prefer the comedy songs. Still, the material is pretty well performed, and this is one of the few C.W. McCall albums that ever came out on CD."
5,christopher jennison,"Perfect! The account and the pictures combine to elicit the joys and the agonies of what it was like to root for the Dodgers in the 1950s. Ebbets Field and the Polo Grounds are here, with some glorious images of Brooklyn landmarks. I too listened to the final inning of the game, transfixed by the miracle. I lived it again, thanks to this marvelous book."
3,works fine,it works good. but the game tends to skip sometimes. also it will only let me play it in 1995 Microsoft program.
4,"Good Game, Not as Good as Carnivores 2","As said in the title compared to Carnivores 2 this game just isn't as fun, this may be because its a little harder (all animals can kill you, the starting map is not beginner friendly, and the animals generally have better senses than Carnivores 2). Also a little disappointed that no new weapons were added to the game and the lower end weapons (pistol, x-bow, single shotgun) are still underpowered and the rest are incredibly overpowered....but despite all of this it's still an awesome game and a good edition to the series. The supply drop function helps you during hunts to restock on ammo, it brings back the classic trophy room, and brings back that feeling that makes the game fun for hunters and action gamers alike. I decided to get this game to get a little nostalgia and it didn't disappoint.If you do get this game and like it I suggest buying Carnivores 2 as well."
2,I love it!,"There are 10 dinos called Archeapteryx, Brontoteriy, Hog, Wolf, Rhino, Diatryma, Giant Deer (Megaloceros), Sabre tooth tiger and Mammoth with the final Cave Bear. Wait a minute! Archeapteryx is not in the menu!

1,No new idea,"1. The author advises the use of templates for process consulting. This is not a new idea in IT. Templates are used both in production and process. Templates of all sizes and shapes are used in writing code, IT project management process, spreadsheet templates for calculations etc. It is mature to an extent where templates are generated without much hoo-ha and contributed for reuse.2. The book, in an attempt to be overarching, is stretching itself in early stages where it reviews the economy of the world and the industries in 1 broad stroke.3. The idea of using templates for consulting is not new and is already being practiced in all nooks and corners."
5,Potent,This is for me one of the most intelligent and beautiful books on Genesis I have ever read. The depth of the book takes several (hundred?) readings to fully grasp its height and breadth. A must have.Ms. Zornberg's grasp of her subject matter is awesome and inspiring.
2,Zornberg Wanders Aimlessly Through Genesis,"Zornberg's book on Genesis had much promise for me, but the book failed to live up to this promise. The author is certainly well versed in the rabbinic commentaries on the Genesis text, but her writing style is so disorganized, and her intellectual leaps so large that following her arguments often take more time than they are worth. If you are searching for a contemporary analysis of the first book of the Bible, I would recommend Dennis Shulman's Genius of Genesis. This latter book was time much better spent."
2,learned but dull,"This densely written book gives the patient reader a few of the same insights that one can get from a good Chumash (Torah w/commentary) such as the Artscroll Chumash or the Conservatives' Etz Chaim-- so I would not say it is completely worthless. The difference is that a Chumash is pithier and more clearly written than this book. When I read the Torah portion every week, I sometimes can't put it down (especially in Genesis). By contrast, I found it impossible to keep plowing through this learned but dull, dull, dull tome."
3,Disappointed,"Bought this for my wedding, very disappointed. The knife came bent, and the set wasn't nearly as good looking as in the pictures. I returned it. Ended up ordering a simliar set from Amazon by Mikasa and really like that one."
4,Great! Love it!,"The set is very modern, clean and simple. I plan on using it for my wedding and after. It's weighted well and sturdy. Only complaint is that the point of the cake server is quite sharp and came with a few blemishes on the steel. Otherwise, fantastic product and would recommend it!"
3,Sharp points,Really pretty set and they work nicely. I bought them as a gift for someone. But the cake server point is so pointed you could hurt someone with it and if you push down to much in a pan it will scrape it.
3,A standard James Taylor album,"James Taylor has always been an amazing singer songwriter, however, In the pocket is nowhere near the masterpiece that everyone is raving about. It is indeed just a standard good album with many legitimate album cuts. There are no hits after shower the people but every song is consistent. Don't buy this expecting another sweet baby james, hbuy it knowing that it is just nice! A good buy if you like JT."
4,My Older Dog Loves This Cushion,"This Cushion is primarily used when dog is outside under a covered porch. I put this bed on top of her other bed so my dog has extra cushioning as she is older. It was a little too big, so I fold it a little to make it fit. The crinkle noise that others mentioned is there, but it does not bother my dog at all. I'm happy with this and have told some of my friends about this even for their cats. The other dogs in our household prefer this bed also. have only had it for a few months so don't know how long this will last."
1,"Questionable, dated, and unsophisticated","This ""text"" vastly oversimplifies the complexities of special needs children and families and in many cases may do more harm than good in training/facilitating future teachers and child care professionals.I am in complete agreement with the previous reviewer as this book should be titled ""Basic Disability Awareness Exercises.""This sets a very low bar regarding the level we want prospective teachers and child care professionals to tackle in terms of supporting special needs children.If you're looking for a text that is actually comprehensive and genuinely useful beyond simplistic prescriptive ideas/activities regarding this subject I'd recommend Ann Turnbull's text, ""Exceptional Lives""Take home message,...there are clearly many other BETTER choices than this book.Exceptional Lives: Special Education in Today's Schools (6th Edition)"
3,Be aware of mistakes,"While this book provides many good activities for teachers to use in their classroom to promote disability awareness, the authors' guidelines to use with children with disability are way off base. For example, under 'hearing loss' they suggest not to touch a hearing impaired child to get his attention so he will become conditioned to attend to your voice as a signal. While this will work for some children, it is not an appropriate suggestion for many deaf children who cannot hear anything even with hearing aids. When a mistake is made like this, it makes me reconsider the other recommended guidlines. I would highly suggest that before these guidelines are used, the reader check with the childs' parents or special education teacher to make sure they are appropriate for that child."
5,A useful handbook to help teachers and students.....,"This is a world where we need to understand and help those in need, especially those kids with special education needs. The book has provided many useful checklists, questionaires, and ideas to help special education teachers share some thoughts and clearify some myths with other students in class and at school. Cute comics on almost every page make it more fun to read. If you are the one who would like to give a hand to those kids with special education needs, this is the book you must have at hand!"
1,disapointed,"I bought this in the first day of the month by amazon and they promised me delivered until dec 11, but now dec 15 I did not receive it and I have already received the bill to pay. It is absurd! I do not recomend to buy anything else from them."
5,Excellent,"An important book that will expand your sense of the human body in space, the way we communicate, and the importance of thoughtful movement."
3,small and not black and white.,I searched for black and white products for some reason this pillow came up and after recieving I realized the white is actually a off white creme color. The pillow is also small.
3,The Civil Engineering Handbook,"This book should be in the libraray of many civil engineers. It covers a broad spectrum of topics. It provides worked examples in some sections. I would like to see alot more detail; however, I imagine it would take at least double the amount of space to provide the detail I would like to see. That said, every civil engineer needs this book. My suggestion is to purchase it as well as other more detailed books to supplement it in depth in your chosen field to get the most value."
4,"A more electric type of ""sweet baby james""","What I really love about this album is because it is electric taylor but it still truly maintains that awesome charm and beauty of Sweet baby James. It is not electric like ""gorilla"" or ""In the pocket"" which are good discs, but this is a more ""tasteful electric"". Taylor alters between ballads with strings, ballads with horns and ballads with himself, as well as jazz and folk. Not bad James! Paul and Linda McCartney as well as Carly simon are featured on a lot of songs and it gives the album a great feel. The album has 10 songs which for this type of album is perfect. You will be hooked with the first 5 songs. However, song 4 ""me and my guitar"" has awful lyrics but still a nice hook. skip ""ain't no song""-he didn't even write it and go onto the beautiful ""Hello old friend"". By then you have 3 songs left and they are all soothing. the album has a few loose ends but once it's over you'll be glad you've listened to it."
4,OK Album - sounds a little rushed though.,"JT's Walking Man is a good album. Not great but good.The title track is the highlight for me, but there are also a few nuggets in here like ""Daddy's Baby"", ""Me & My Guitar"", ""Let It All Fall Down"", and ""Fading Away"".They one thing I must mention is that this album is the first with that has the ""comtemporary"" JT feel to it.Bottom Line: Walking Man is ""good"", not James' finest though so do not start with this album. -- try out the previous 3 albums to get that cool sound."
4,Walking Man Walks On,While this album did not receive great critical acclaim...I couldn't even find it in local CD stores. It is one of my favorite JT albums. The music is so soothing. It takes me to where I am most comfortable. It is sitting in a easy chair holding a nice cup of hot chocolate in front of a fireplace with a roaring fire on a chilly night. Safe and secure.
5,This is a Great album from James Taylor,"James Taylor / Walking Man: There are just a couple of hits on this one, but the album is memorable, moving, and excellent. This album rates Five Stars."
5,"Good Surf Music, Funny too","This is a pretty funny album, lots of alcohol theme stuff and jokes like ""the Hindu Elvis"". But it's actually really good surf music. It's got the traditional reverb and retro tricks but with a bit of an updated flair. If you like surf music, you'll definitely like this record."
3,Foodsaver 1 Qt,"Worked for a while...still ok to seal dry products; developed stress cracks. It has been my experience that Tilia products eventually deteriorate or lose their effectiveness. This is my 2nd Foodsaver product. Next time, I go to Cabela's and pay the price. (Tilia, are you paying attention?...probably don't care)"
1,Defective latch design,"The canister is first class. The lid is first class. But the latch design used to latch the lid just prior to pulling a vacuum is flawed. Our latch cracked at the hinged pin, which essentially renders the canister non-functioal as a vacuum canister. Just by looking at the design you can see that the latching mechanism obviously needs to be redesigned.This product has no guarantee, but I am asking Foodsaver for a replacement."
1,BEWARE! BEWARE! BEWARE!,"Don't say you haven't been warned. I have had 2 of these products crack after first use. I bought 3 and Amazon already replaced one. I'm trying to return ALL of them. There is some sort of design or manufacturing flaw in this product.Don't get me wrong, I love all my other Foodsaver containers, but NONE of them have cracked on me like this one.UPDATE 10-26-2005: The 3rd one developed a crack just like the previous....go figure."
2,They crack no matter what you try...,"We bought several. Treated with care, hand washed, used lower pressure, never dropped. All cracked in less than 10 uses."
3,So So,The referral section and the cold calling sections had useful information. Nothing earth shattering.
5,House of Plenty,"This is a great story about a truly amazing company......a sad commentary on the death of an American business ethic, and an interesting family history...very worth the read. I LOVED IT."
3,Interesting but painful to read,I grew up in San Antonio so was eager to read about the history of Luby's. While it was interesting it was also tedious reading. The writing style is florid and repetitious. Throughout the book I couldn't help thinking that it would have made a great Texas Monthly article. It is about 200 pages too long.
2,House of Plenty,I was disappointed with the purchase I made. I thought it was a cookbook and it wasnt. I was looking for a cookbook from Luby's and I thought this book had some recipes. I wish that when purchasing a book it would allow the consumer to flip through some pages or show the table of contents. To provide more info other then just the title. My book is still in the box it came in. I dont know the policy for returning merchandise when the customer is not satisfied. Any feedback would be appreciated. Thank you for allowing customers to express their thoughts/opinions.
5,Josh Groban....extended edition,"A special treat for Josh's favorite country to visit, this Japanese release has extra tracks not available in America unless you're a part of his fanclub.Everything else about the CD is exactly the same as the American Closer release, a stunning companion album to the immensely popular debut album from 2002. With depth and clarity Josh Groban invites his fans to understand his own unique musicality, introducing his own lyrics, composition, and choice of guest artists like Deep Forest. Bravo Josh!"
3,Ugly singing from Hadley,"The singing in this video is generally very lovely, especially the pastoral king, and his lady. They are just divine. The other soprano is also very enjoyable, and the secondary tenor is acceptable. But Hadley is surprisingly awful in this recording. The voice is pleasant but the coloratura is just sad. He does some of the most awkward singing you can imagine. Bad enough to take a 5-star rating down to 3 - I found him painful to hear.The sets and costumes are quite nice, but Hadley is really disappointing."
2,Trivial,You have to compare this Mozart opera to his major operas. It is staged well but utterly trivial and boring.
1,Very poor quality,The red and black wire that are advertised as 8gage are not really 8 gage.Do not use this with a 1000 watt amp unless you want your car to catch fire.
3,Its ok,The wire connector ends that you crimp on the the wire are pretty crappy. Other than that wire is wire when it boils down to it all. Great lengths on the wire. Wired it in my crew cab Nissan titan and it went from the front of the truck to the rear.
1,Garbage,"No way will this handle 1000 watts at 17' ! Normally I read reviews, for some reason this slipped by. Wire is 8 ga if they include shielding! WASTE of $$$$$$$$. rca cables are junk as well. There are much better quality kits at this price. junk!!!"
1,fail,complete garbage undersized wire. dont waste your money. the only thing worth using was maybe the signal wire. the wire was maybe 12 possible 14 gage diffidently not 8 gage
3,Not as advertised..,"Not as advertised.. But still not bad. I use this to run a little 300w amp I have for mids and highs and it seems to be okay, just wouldn't trust it with a 1000w amp as it advertises. The wires are very cheap made but I guess you get what you pay for!"
2,"right amout of cable, wrong termial ends","The power and audio cables are of the correct type and good length to install the system in my truck. They are missing the cable from the amp to the speakers but thats my failt for not reading the description fully the Issue I had was it gave you 2 connectors 14-16g to use and on the power cord and ground this is not only impossible to fit that wire correctly into the 8g cables it could cause the termial connectors to fail beacuse they are only rated to 27 amps. My system could draw 40amps during operation. I took the option of solidering the wires much safer. I still do not see how this ""kit"" can be sold as is, If a first timer user who know little about wiring uses this they could install it and have serious issues"
2,doesnt work with gms,tried installing the wire to my battery terminal and the piece to connect to it was to small to fit on the terminal so i had to buy more connectors
2,"bad remote wire, no speaker wire","This amp kit doesn't come with speaker wire to run from the amp to the sub box. Also, the remote wire was discontinuous in my package (i.e. the resistance was infinite between one end and another)."
2,Not what I expected,"I thought this would be a list of adult grahic novels, like those of Harvey Pekar. A few were, but many were for children or comic book collectors. I do not think some of them really qualify as graphic novels. From the term ""your library"" I understood my own personal library, but seems it is for public librarians serving a mixed public. Fine, but I did not see that in the editorial description."
4,Great resource for teachers,I received the book and it is just what I wanted....a great resource. I teach Language Arts in Junior High and I wanted a list of graphic novels to guide me in my purchases as to suitability and content. It has certainly provided direction.
2,Childhood Dreams,"The main problem with this book is the list itself. There are far too many books aimed at children and teens, and not enough for the mature reader. The author seems to have stopped reading the latest books, and is trapped by the classic, easy insertions. How can you leave out ""Road to Perdition"" and ""A History of Violence"" ? Sure, Spiderman and Superman are fine, but both of these are more comic book and less graphic novel. The term Graphic Novel has moved beyond the superhero stage."
5,Worth Every Penny !!!!!!,"I Was Thrill To Finally Get S-1 V-2 Of ""Streets..."" Great Picture & Sound Just Like Vol 1, The Stories Are Terrific, Very Enjoyable To Watch And Being Able To Watch Shows Like This Is Worth $60.00 A Season For An Hour Long Show Of Great Quality....I Care About The Quality Of What I Purchase Not The Price!!!!! Having My TV SHOWS On Dvd To Watch When I Want As Often As I Want For Years To Come Is Worth The Price!!!!!"
5,Simply amazing,"What a flashback, to be able to watch these classics of 70s TV again. The picture quality and color is superb, as is the audio. I only pray they decide to release the rest of the seasons on DVD. I will be first in line if they do. So many Quinn Martin shows aren't out on DVD yet. Perhaps this will open the door to Cannon, Barnaby Jones, and even the Invaders beng released? Even if you don't care for the plots, the DVDs are an incredible joy to watch for the vivid colors of San Francisco in the 70s. I can't remember seeing such a clean set of DVDs in a boxed set."
4,Many Stars Guest Star in This Show,Buy this DVD since Judith McConnell who is Best known for her role of Sophia Capwell in the soap opera Santa Barbara Guest starred in The Streets Of San Francisco episode Act Of Duty playing a police woman.
1,Paint chipping at bottom,"This was expensive, but I thought it would be worth it..I have only had it for 2 weeks and at the bottom of the trash can there is chips of paint falling off...I can't blame UPS, because it would be chipping all over the can...Very disappointing.."
5,Best Garbage Can EVER!!!,I didn't think it was possible to LOVE a garbage can. How weird is that? But I do truly LOVE this garbage can with all my heart! It's the perfect size. Inside is basically a large plastic bucket with a handle where the garbage sack goes. It's brilliant because you just lift the bucket right out and it's incredibly easy to wash and keep clean. The foot peddle is great for when your hands are messy. I have a small space for a kitchen and it works great in a small space.
5,AWESOME!,i LOVE my charm! it was exactly what i wanted---arrived beautifully and un-harmed....quick delievery!
4,"good, but...","music: really goodcover of eleanor rigby: fantasticdvd: MUCH to be desiredthe dvd was more like ""fall in love with thrice"" than actual music; left with disappointed feeling. the cd is pretty quality though"
3,"A B-Side Collection, If Ever There Was One","If the live tracks weren't good, I'd be upset by their inclusion. But most of these songs are really good. The Eleanor Rigby cover alone warrants purchase of this release. Just don't expect too much from each track. After all, it is meant to be a B-side collection."
4,How do you define a Christian band?,"It seems that there has been a lot of confusion over Thrice being a Christian band. Let me start by saying that as far as I know, Thrice had started indie and then signed under a secular label when they released Artist in the Ambulence. I don't believe they've ever been under a Christian music label before. But is it the label that makes a band Christian, or is the position of the musicians themselves that make the band Christian. Dustin Kensrue brings amazing lyrics in Vheissu That at times are taken directly from Scripture. Most of the bandmembers of Thrice are self-proclaimed born-again believers in Christ. Vheissu I think best proclaims what they believe in while not being offensively in-your face. Honestly, I think Thrice is the best example of a Christian band out there, not to mention the definition of great music. :)"
1,DONT BUY THIS,"this cd SUCKS! this is almost like a ""greatest hits"" album. seeing that i have all of thrice's previous cd's i figured that this one was gunna be awesome. WRONG! only 9 tracks, which is QUITE SHORT if you ask me. and 2 or 3 songs are previously recorded songs! so basically they were like, ""lets go to the studio for a weekend and record 2 songs and get the rest from an acoustic concert piece we do. yea with this junk cd they put out thrice has dropped like a rock"
3,our boys overseas said they got a kick out of it,"but I didn't get to see it myself; they might have just been being polite. I would check for more reviews; a similar item I had sent here was barely audible (could hardly hear the sound). I hope this item is better than that ... it's a pretty cute idea, I think, but of course just a momentary once-or-twice kind of entertainment - I doubt it would keep a kid occupied for hours or anything ... depending on the kid, I guess (!) 'course that would be up to the parents to nip that in the bud (no pun intended). Service was careful with mailing instructions; it was received in Iraq in due time and plenty of guys who needed a laugh to pass it around to there!"
3,too old,"This book sounded alluring but it's too dated to be of much use anymore. I was bored and disappointed, although every word in it is true. Great for a young woman or someone just beginning to think about feminism and how women have evolved together over time."
2,Decent Drive - Terrible Software,"If you plan to use this only as an external hard drive, it may work well for you. So far mine is not having the squeeking issues that others have reported. However, the backup/restore software that it comes with (Retrospect Express for Windows) is atrocious. If you've got any of the latest software from Microsoft (with .NET framework 2.0), it doesn't work out of the box and simply hangs without any error messages. You have to download the latest patch from the web site. It worked for a few days but broke again after the latest automatic Windows update. Maxtor phone support hours are useless, so I'm waiting for an email response. Be prepared to fight with the software if you intend to use it."
1,No Good,I got this a while ago; Too many steps to get to your saved files. It also stopped working (got the blue screen of death)and i cannot get to my files.Would not buy this product again nor would i recommend this product.
4,Ok study guide..,"CD's are good except he talks a bit too fast!! Actually, he talks very fast, so you might have to spend plenty of time pressing rewind on your CD player to catch what he is saying."
3,Talked too fast!,"The content of the tapes was okay. My main complaint is that the speaker simply talks too fast. This substantially increases the listener's workload because he is trying to keep up.My recommendation: If you want to learn evidence, try Weissenberger's ""Federal Rules of Evidence."" It will help you much more than these tapes will."
1,Don't do it,"Be careful if you buy this or any other CD set from Amazon, I was missing a CD in this set and I ordered the Constitutional law CD set, which was missing 2 discs. Amazon people are also impossible to get in touch with so you risk spending $65 on a defective product and never getting reimbursed. DON'T DO IT"
5,Fascinating Study of Renaissance Books and Woodcuts,"This book is a necessary corrective to recent scholarly work on the complex relation between word and image in the sixteenth century. Knapp's elegant arguments about the role played by the struggle between the image and the word in an emergent English historiography greatly refines our knowledge of the subject.The overarching argument of the book is that the disappearance of the visual component in printed books facilitated the naturalization of historical representation as historical truth, and his excellent chapters on Foxe and Holinshed's Chronicles are particularly persuasive. The real strength of the book is that it brings together current scholarship on the history of the material book and a keen understanding of early modern English culture; and it does so with a theoretical sophistication rarely seen in textual scholarship."
1,I rented only one disc of this selection. I am glad I did not buy it.,"After reading many positive reviews on Amazon.com, I rented disc 1 of this selection. I preferred reading the illustrated story. It's more suspenseful. On the contrary, the movie is boring. Also, the animation is stiff.I am glad I did not buy it."
3,A pretty good yard sale,"Short stories aren't Martin Amis' thing. It's just impossible to compare Heavy Water to London Fields, Money, The Information and all those other muscular big-budget novels that I find myself dipping into when I need a bit of a lift. Amis' two books of non-fiction are more entertaining. Still, to the dedicated Amis fan, Heavy Water proves that even his cast-off stuff is better than most writers' best; the book displays a tremendous elasticity of style from the hilarious role reversal of the poet and screenplay writer in the first story to the somber and technical science fiction of the 'Janitor on Mars.' Heavy Water is worth the cash outlay, but after this and Night Train, I'm ready for another meaty five hundred pager marinated in the BO of Keith Talent or BS of John Self. And I probably speak for most Amis fans."
4,My Favorite Birthday Present,"I received an autographed copy of this book and was hesitant to read it. I am a big fan of Martin Amis and bent the spine and folded corners in it right away!Amis's flexability as a writer is evident in this book.The stories in this book are different from The Rachel Papers and Dead Babies. For those familiar with his work, it fits somewhere in the middle. For those not, this would be a good one to start."
2,OK,"These are hard stories to get involved in, especially the ones that throw out literary agents and such ilk. I like his other work....but this was rather boring."
4,An Interesting Collection by a Talented Writer,"What's up with all these negative reviews? This is a strong collection that certainly does not deserve these pans. Each story in Heavy Water contains an interesting premise that Amis runs with and makes a successful story out of. For instance, in Career Move, the pop culture value of poems and screenplays have been reversed. It's an interesting idea and a funny story. The last piece, What Happened to Me on my Holiday is narrated by an 11 year old who is hard to understand. I think Amis did it this way because he did not want the story, a heartbreaking tale of the sudden death of a young boy, to be taken lightly, to be breezed over. This is an interesting collection. Give it a try if you are at all interested in Amis' work"
4,HEAVY SATIRE,"My first encounter with Martin Amis. A diverse collection of satirical short stories. Each sends an arrow into some area of human behavior. I found most or them amusing and on the mark; focusing on the humor and the pathos of the human condition. Some go a bit too far. Amis stretches, as my grandchildren do when they tell a funny story which gets a laugh from the adults. (No stopping them as they go beyond the point of humor or good sense.)He has a talent for sensing the absurd and expanding it with great verve, and a wonderful command of the English language.I look forward to reading his novels."
5,I'm glad to know that other people love this band,"I have to repeat what was written: ""the best album that no one has ever heard of."" I played this for the fisrt time on air at KFSR it quickly became one of my very few favorites. I still listen to it regularly. It's way too bad these guys couldn't keep it together. Black 14 is true creative and performance talent- one of a kind. I am still kicking myself for passing up what turned out to be the only chance I had to see them."
5,Stumbled upon,"This Cd has made a positive influence in my life. One of my most prized CDs I own. Just listen, better yet just buy it! My only dissapointment was that the band did not continue making albums after 94. Damn!"
3,"Interesting, but stopped short of being truly helpful.",The book gave some interesting information that gives cause for concern to the consumer. However there was no 'step by step' guide telling how to avoid the bad guys.
3,A bit overbearing.,"There was too much time spent on the topic of what is wrong with the system, and not enough pratical information to help the consumer determine if they are getting good quality dental care. The book contains good basic information on dental procedures."
1,Scare tactics and antiquated views,"In my opinion, this book is filled with outdated information and tries to scare patients into avoiding dental advances made over the past 25 years. If these guys ever write a similar book about medical treatment, they will probably recommend leeches and bloodletting for your ailments!"
1,horrible movie,"this movie is trash. the plot was cheesy, the animation horrible; mouths dont move when the characters talk and the voice acting was terrible. jon stewart is a very bad animation actor. i hope he sticks w the much better daily show. after i came out of this movie i wanted my money back. i wouldve left early in the movie but i kept hoping it would get better. sadly, no"
2,See Hoodwinked Instead,"After seeing Hoodwinked and enjoying it, I looked forward to this movie, by the same makers. Also, with talent like Kevin Smith, Chevy Chase, Whoopi Goldberg and William H. Macy, I had high expectations. I was very disappointed.The movie makes a few cultural references, which is amusing, but not really funny. There are very few actual jokes, and characters that are not at all developed after the initial introduction. The wizards, good and evil, look like Jack-in-the-Boxes which have escaped their boxes, which seems odd and unnecessary. Their powers come from their pizza-box-guy stereotype mustasches, which is sort of cute.Small children will probably enjoy the brightly colored scenes and the triumph of good over evil, but I'd give this one a miss if you're over 6. I gave it two stars because it wasn't so bad that I had to turn it off, though I came close."
1,B-O-R-I-N-G,Too bad so many high profile stars were used for such a poorly written and boring movie. This should move to the bottom of the dustbin.
3,Doogal,Great movie for Kids. Shipping was not what I expected but still good enough to buy from this company.
3,Not Shrek but not Master of Disguise either,"Yes, this isn't the world's greatest animated movie but it's not even close to being the worst. The characters are cute and interesting to children and it's not really designed to appeal much to adults. Most children's TV series today don't appeal to adults either (with some notable exceptions like Kipper and Pocoyo). It's not a classic must have and do keep in mind it was based on a old TV series and like most movies based on TV series it's something that probably could have been done in 1/2 hour show and kept the kids happy. That being said I think anyone giving it 1 star (or less) is a bit off base for what the film was really intended. Not something I'd have paid money to see in the cinema at full price but wouldn't stop me from buying a copy for the house. It reminds me a lot of the Christmas TV specials we would wait each year to see - Rudolph, Frosty etc. At least the animation has improved a lot since then!"
1,Don't waste your time on this one,"I'm writing a review to save other parents from wasting 85 minutes of their lives on this. This is possibly the worst children's movie I've ever been forced to watch. I just feel awful for all the actual stars that lent their voice talents to this movie. What a horrible thing to have to have on their resumes. Rather than having an actual story, it seems like a bunch of advertising/marketing people came up with this movie - gathering together bits they thought would ""sell."" But it doesn't work. Even kids movies need a compelling story. Don't waste your time or money on this."
1,this movie is bad,"If your young kids do not like kids being froze on a merry-go-round then don't see it. it is too short, too boring, and to innapropriate for younger kids"
1,Please do not buy this for your children,"It is awful.Pay no attention to the actors giving voices to this movie.It doesn't make this movie worth your time, much less your money."
1,Only For a Child,"My two and a half year old son loves this movie...and ONLY for the train. The animation is poor compared to Dreamworks, Pixar/Disney. They have big actors as ""co-stars"" to a poorly cast ""main character"". Hearing Doogal speak absolutely ruins this movie. But like any parent would say...if it makes the kids happy so be it...for adults it just makes you wish for a mute button."
2,Like a Puzzle with a Missing Piece.,"This film is the plot for The Lord of the Rings and the Chronicles of Narnia with action and setting from film like the Matrix, Indian Jones, and Dawn of the Dead. Sometimes it feels like it's just being packed on just because there's room enough to pack more on. But really, the graphics are amazing; the story is enjoyable; and many of the characters are just loveable.It's the main character that screws up the whole story. (I liked Jar-Jar Binks.) This guy is so bad. Not only is the character in and of itself the most annoying character ever screened, but the voice actor seems to have read: every, single, line, off, a, queue, card. There's no emotion, intensity, or variation in any part of his performance. He could define m-o-n-o-t-o-n-e.Other more minor complaints are many elements of the plot seem to have been placed in there just because the direct thought everybody else would do it, so he should also. It feels flat when you get through it. It's bad."
1,Absolutely A-okay...................,"I hate the phrase A-okay just as much as I hate the movie Doogal! This movie barely had a story to it! It was just one popculture reference after another with no story connecting those references! I was just waiting for that crappy phrase it's the nineties ya'll! If it had the""It's the 90's"" phrase I would have given it -100 stars! I do know it's not the 90's( this movie wasn't made in the 90's either) but even so that Phrase sucks now just as much as it did then!Doogal had some ugly looking character designs and dull dialogue! I agree that Doogal's voice sucks!I recommend Hoodwinked over this turd any day!"
1,Strange!,Zero Stars! Bad! Bad! Bad! The only reason it will keep a child's attention is it's animated.
1,Even a five year old said it was boring!,"Terrible movie. The story is very slow and makes no sense, and the main character's voice is very annoying. The preview makes this movie look funny, while there's only really one funny part in the whole movie."
1,The worst movie of all time.,"Oh, so bad. I wish there was a way to give it no stars. Everything this company produces stinks."
5,Doogal,"Yeesh, people expect so much from a movie these days. Relax and enjoy the film.Many people think this movie stunk. Trust me, there are way worse. For me,I thought this movie was good. I watched it twice in a row. The acting was good enough and it was cool watching a snail, cow, shaggy dog,train,and bunny go on a little adventure. It was cool spotting out all the references in the movie as well. Give the movie a chance and don't get so into it. It's a short cartoon, not ""Gone with the Wind""."
3,Funny sometimes......but sometimes boring.,the voice of Doogal (Teaser) is not the same as in the movie..... and the story is quite boring sometimes.....
1,Stopping remaking classic TV,"This is destined to go into the cinematic trash can along with the abomination that was ""Thunderbirds"".Please someone tell movie execs top lay off cult TV shows.The ONLY movie adapted from a TV program that worked was ""The Fugitive"".If the movie industry is batting 1 for a zillion, they should stop what they are doing and invest in some ORIGINAL IDEAS."
1,"My kids love it, but I hate it","My kids, ages 1 and 2, love this movie. My little girl asks me to play this movie everyday. However, I absolutely cannot stand it. Mostly because kid who plays Doogal obviously has had no training in acting whatsoever. He plays this role with absolutely no emotion, and whoever wrote about the monotone voice was right. The script is awful. I also find that freaking bunny rabbit (Jimmy Fallon) to be one of the most annoying characters I have ever watched. And I like Jimmy Fallon. I wonder if the stars thought about the damage this sort of movie could do to their careers. I worry about the damage this sort of movie is doing to my kids' brains, but they just can't get enough of it."
1,this stinks,"don't take your kids to go see doogal. it is boring, if some kids like it. critics say it should be rated PG. I am ashamed that the Fairly Odd Parents creator made such a thing."
5,Beautiful!!!!!,I Ordered this anklet for myself because I love butterflies and when I received it Iwas in love thanks!!!!!!
3,Some pretty fair covers,"all right, pretty good for alice. but if you like this, i suggest you listen to the orignal versions of ""unholy war"" and ""stolen prayer"" (that is the correct name, notice the word ""stolen"" is ommited?, how ironic) anyway, these two songs were written by chris cornell and were released on a few soundgarden bootlegs. the one that comes to mind is the ""songs for ozzy"" bootleg. (they were supposedley written for him). the quality is not the greatest, but chris' rendition of ""stolen prayer"" is very good, i think he even sounds like ozzy sort of. and if you read the liner notes, you will notice that chris is credited with singing back-up vocals on this album. i don't mean to sound like i'm putting alice down or anything, but just for yer info, ya know."
4,An underated cd,"Definetly one the Alice's best along with many of his other great ones. It is worth purchasing especially for ""Lost in America""."
3,Eh,"The songs themselves are very good, but too much religion for my taste. If you can get past that, then I would recommend this album."
1,Utter crap.,"This is by far the worst thing Alice Cooper has ever produced. If your a long-time Alice Cooper fan don't be surprised if you start vomiting 10 seconds after putting it on. If you enjoy this kind of thing, what in the hell is wrong with you?"
5,Alice Cooper Rocks,"Alice Cooper proves Why HE Is The Genius In The Metal Genre. This Disc Starts Off With A Bang And Just Keeps Going And Going. WoW, What A Ride"
4,"Wake Up, Little Steven","Back to the world of concept albums for Alice, who brings Steven out of the Nightmare once again. ""The Last Temptation"" is easily the best of his Epic Records trilogy, and follows a story line that echoes the classic novel ""Something Wicked This Way Comes."" Steven enters a dark carnival for which the price of admission is one's soul. Alice rocks more dramatically here than on ""Trash"" or ""Hey Stoopid,"" and harder on the song ""Unholy War"" than anything on his post Warners output. Also like most of the Epic period, the list of extras his heavy on star cameos (Soundgarden/Audioslave lead throat Chris Cornell's contribution to ""Stolen Prayer"" is a highlight). I wouldn't give this a full five stars because it lacks the urgency of his younger years, but if there was a half star available, I'd notch ""The Last Temptation"" up another notch."
4,Classic Coop,"I love this album. It's a smart and creepy concept album that sounds more like the original Alice cooper group/ Welcome to my nightmare days than the early 80's ""hey Stoopid"" stuff.If you like the old style coop sound this is a great update from the king of creepy."
3,"OK, but not what I want from Bill K.","Some nice country ditties, some sensitive tunes, but we need to hear much more of what Bill does best: songs about truck drivers, black coffee and truck stops, graveyards and diesel fuel, truck drivers with girlfriends all over, etc.Bill's trying to be an all around songwriter guy here and does an ok job, but it just sounds like so much other music out there. So please Bill, MORE DIESELCASTER, MORE TRUCKABILLY PLEASE!!! That kind of music is getting hard to find."
2,Missed its potential,"This book contains a lot of excellent information about the development of the Federal Reserve System with many incidents that I had never heard of. However, the writing style is poor since the book is FILLED with cliches. Also the material is not well-organized with a lot of jumping from incident to incident. Lots of fascinating inside stories, but disappointing overall."
3,If you are an investor...,"If you are an investor and you need to know how the Fed influences the stock market among others...If you bought and read ""Secrets of the Temple"" by William Greider and maybe ""Leadership at the Fed"" by Donald Kettl...If you understood them and knew who the named people were...Then you should buy this book too."
2,Misleading Title,"My main problem with this book is that the title really should have been ""A Detailed History of The Fed."" I think I was looking more for what the title implied, a book with a focus almost exclusively on modern times, and concentrating on the relationship between Fed actions and economic reactions. If this is what you, too, are seeking, don't read this book.A secondary problem is that the recitation of Fed history that comprises nearly the entire book is almost unbearably dry.This book's main (only?) good point is its detail. I personally found the amount of detail excessive and boring, but I can't fault the author for completion: the history that this book contains is broad and well-researched."
2,this one bothers my skin,I can only surmise that there IS some hint of something in it that is NOT for sensitive skin as it claims. I have discontinued use - though Dove products are good.Christine
3,Just ok,This product is just ok - it is NOT as invisible as it claims to be! So beware when you wear dark colors! Its anti-perspirant abilities could also be stronger.
2,Didn't work for me,I bought this because it said senstive skin on it. I ended up with a rash after using it for two days so it obviously didn't work on my sensitive skin.
2,Butchered and Mauled,"Please don't buy this thing. The CD side is fine, but the DVD side is a waste of money. The album itself is good, so just buy the CD. The 5.1 mix is crap. The vocals are really loud and stuck in the center speaker. The guitars aren't loud enough, the cymbals'll make your ears bleed and are too loud, and the rears aren't used nearly enough for music this aggressive. Worst of all, the songs are changed! ""Break You""'s vocals keep speeding up and slowing down, changing pitch. Some songs have a few words removed (not cuss words), and sound effects changed. In ""Now You've Got Something to Die For"" everything goes silent towards the end all of a sudden, and then comes back just as suddenly, skipping a few seconds of the song. The CD side is identical to the original as is the DVD stereo, which is only 48KHz/16bit resolution (CD is 44.1/16) so it doesn't sound much better (it actually sounds worse due to a top range volume cut that Sony applies to all of its DualDisc's DVD stereo)."
3,"Good Album, eh on the DualDisc","Don't get me wrong, I think that this album totally kicks ass. And I never had any problems playing the CD side of the DualDisc. I never tried it in 5.1, so I don't know if it cuts out like the other reviewers mention, but I do know that the videos included are nothing new. If you have their DVD Terror and Hubris, then you have absolutely no reason to buy the DualDisc. In fact, if you've even seen Terror and Hubris, then you really won't find the need to ever watch the DVD side. There's a music video on there too, but it's nothing particularly awesome. And plus this version is like 8 bucks more than the regular version. With the money you save you can almost buy the Killadelphia DVD, which is most likely way cooler than the video on this."
1,Music is worth 5 stars but...,"I cannot make the CD side of this disc play for anything. The DVD side works great, but I wish to listen to the music in something other than a DVD player."
1,"5 stars for album, 0 for DualDisc","If you already own the album, good. Look no further then. It's not worth it to get a DualDisc. The idea of a double-sided cd doesn't sound very promising, and from I read, not very good either. If it was a cd/dvd combo where there were two separate discs, you've got something different, but both on one disc? Forget it, pass on this. Lamb Of God's a good band with a great third album, but this ain't worth it."
5,You can look but you'll unlikely find a better CD,"Luckily I heard about this band long before they got huge (and they will). I have been able to catch them live as an opening act twice. The album captures the energy of the live performance and is an excellent recording. Looking forward to the new release and to some headline shows. If you like Marshall Crenshaw, Candy Skins, Lighting Seeds or anything else that's pop candy and will give you cavities, you'll like the Push Stars. Improve the quality of your miserable life by picking up this great recording. Then continue to ride the wave by sharing with friends. You'll be the envy of all. My favorite part... all that sound from three people."
5,A must have when you have dyads,"There are very few people who are brilliant at understanding statistics (really understanding it deeply) and gifted at explaining it to others. Kenny and his colleagues are such people. He brought us the distinction between moderators and mediators and developed the ""gold standard"" test for mediation. Now, he and his colleagues point out the problems inherent in analyzing dyadic data and explain how to analyze such data. If your data include 2 or more people who interact with one another, this book is a must have for data analysis."
1,Jeeez....,"I should've known to put it down. The story starts out with a young girl accused of the murder of her boyfriend. By arson, with kerosene. Her name is Cary Seen. Ugh. There is a chemical sniffing dog involved, it's handler's name is Kaye Nine. I should've known. If you'd like to waste about an hour of your time, and be completely frustrated, go ahead and read it. Maybe you can figure out the verdict, since it's not even written into the story. ARGH!"
3,Not Really Moog,"Don't waste your money on this damper. This is sold as a Moog but is really nothing more than a made in Mexico cofap with a Moog part number on it. Paperwork inside box has cofap on it. I returned the first one, got same thing the second time. This is not a terrible damper, but why pay more for a part number."
2,"Amp Kit, didnt hold up to the watts indicated.","The product indicated that it was for up to 1200 watts, now I knew that it would not be able to transfer that kind of power right off the top. Well what I didnt expect that 750 watts would melt the power wire all the way to the trunk. Yes it was installed properly and I had the fuse block installed 10cm from the battery and the actual housing for the fuse melted as opposed to simply burning out the fuse...not normal. Im not quite sure if I just got a bad kit or what, but I can tell you this I did not go get the same one to replace it. :)"
4,Useful in Stimulating Ideas,"I judge a book like this one by whether it stimulates ideas I can use in my business. Since my business is very much effected by the ideas in Blur, I found it very rewarding. I learned much that will cause me to adjust my business to be more competitive in the market of the future. If you are in a position to use this material, this may prove to be a very valuable book. If you are just reading for pleasure, it may not be the best book of its type. I read ""The Death of Distance"" at the same time as this book, and I found ""Blur"" many times more useful in generating ideas. This is subjective; however, a creative person may find this evaluation useful."
3,Not to the point,"The authors did start with some new interesting ideas but as I kept reading, I somehow could not relate those ideas to the instances provided in the book. The examples provided are not particular to BLUR scenario but are general in nature and applicable to existing models too.If you read the 60 points of BLUR summarized in the last section, you can skip reading the entire book.Overall OK but lacks strong correlation to subject idea."
3,Good anthropological description of today's business world,"BLUR is less a guru ""how to"" than it is a study of trends in speed and connectivity in commerce. The authors' include convenient business mini-cases to support their observations. While thought-provoking, I was disappointed in the absence of any explicit value commentary regarding the consequences of society embracing BLUR concepts - good and bad."
2,Traditional Ideas spun for the out-dated dot com generation.,"I have found that this book was a weak and uncreative attempt to brand ""BLUR"" as a modern innovation of conducting business when it has simply re-spun and devalued traditional business practices into a dot com unsustainable ideal. This book preaches that there is little need for the tangible bottom line for the intangibles of business out weigh the value of the actual assets. That may be partially true; however, what actually happens when that model is embraced is uncontrollable corruption in the market. If you are a beginner in the business world and have trouble reading, you will find a few good business ideas and examples within the double spaced, trivially written text. However, as it was published in 1999 most of the ideas are now a BLUR of the past. There are better books out there. Don't waste your time."
4,Interesting but nothing novel.,The examples in the book were nice but often didn't accurately paint the real picture. Seemed to be a lot of bandwagoning with something new without really trying to see if it was effective. But I enjoyed the book and it was well written and easy to read. As a software developer I find it frustrating that the new solution to all of the problems of buisness are believed to be in software.
2,Precis of What We Already Know!,"This book attempts a discussion on the forces shaping the current state of market and tries to extrapolate this to the future. In this era of 'Blur', how can we be certain of success in the future when we are not sure of its direction?On Page 31, there is mention of the availability of a '7 x 24' 800 number. Having a 800 number is only an incentive and does not guarantee your availability to your customers!On Page 33, 'is your offer online'? Being online means nothing. One has to be able to integrate his online services with his buyers and sellers!Well, I have read a couple of books which attempt to discuss the same but without any success!"
3,Personal Review,"Authors Davis and Meyer bring forth their definition of BLUR. They give their perspective on the three ideas of Blur; speed, intangibles and connectivity. Very interesting view about their view regarding people and ""BLUR"". Actually, could have gone directly to the end of the book where they listed their top 60 ways to blur business and self.Would recommend this book to anyone in business. Good information about how we should stay connected."
2,Ambitious title!,"The concept of the book is quite novel and interesting. The title seems to demand a reading of the book. However, utter disappointment awaits the reader. The book is very poorly written. The authors have used the ""blur"" terminology ad infinitum that it starts to grate on your nerves. Have a supply of valium handy! Given their desire to relate everything that happens to BLUR, they over-extend their point to ridiculous lengths."
4,Good information and insight for the middle 50 percent.,I thought BLUR helped shed some light on where technology is taking us. For the advanced user and/or developers of such technology it may seem simplistic. For the intermediate useres of technology it may help put things into perspective. Its easy to read and very enjoyable.
1,Don't Bother,"I originally chose this title because it was cheaper to add it to my order and get the free super saver shipping then paying the minimum shipping rate. However I can honestly say that I would have been better off if I had just paid the extra dollar as I would not have wasted my time reading this garbage.Lets look at the title shall we ""10 Secrets I Learned from The Apprentice"". First of all I am highly skeptical that the author learned these 10 ""Secrets"" from the television show. More likely the author just wanted to write a book with some sort of tie in to a popular television show in misguided hopes of making some money.Well guess what, the book is selling for scraps now. So if you want to learn how to end up in the metaphorical bargain bin of whatever your chosen profession get this book. If you want Apprentice like advice for business read one of the books authored by Trump that have made it to the best seller lists."
3,Really for fools,Really very basics. Would not recommend for mass crowd. This is only for college grads entering their new job or business.
2,Mediocre,"This book is really not that good. It is ok and has a few sharp, interesting comments on banks and banking services, but overall, it has very little that is original to say. I would not recommend it to anyone. It got 2 stars because at least I didn't notice to many errors in it. It was a tedious book."
1,"Terrible, junior high school level depth","The book doesn't go into much depth about anything really and is a very basic look at managing your money. They give worthless tips like don't go into credit card debt because you will have to pay it off forever and other useless, common sense tips everyone knows. Read it if you want some definitions but don't expect anything important to come of it."
1,Wanna save money? Don't buy this book!,"This is one of the worst ""money managing"" books I've ever read. I couldn't put this book down fast enough. Talk about cutting corners!! For example, in Chapter 4, they define ""yeild"" and ""rate"", but do not define what a CD is -- they just mention ""CD"". The book is so poorly organized. The amount of space and ink that's wasted on the inane humor could have been used wisely for elaborate explantions. Just opt for a clearly-written economics book instead of ""Managing Your Money""."
3,Descriptive of MINIX structure,"This book does a very good job at walking the reader through the various functions of MINIX, but it does not go into the specifics very well. In short, it is a good technical book, but it is not one I recommend for an introduction to Operating Systems, since it glazes over many things. So while I had a good grasp of how MINIX operates, I had little knowledge on how to add more to the OS, or how to write my own OS.While MINIX was a good choice for the text, as MINIX is an operating system written to be understood, I just think the authors could gone much more in detail. A strong grasp of C is also required, so make sure you know your stuff before reading this book."
3,A description of MINIX,"As a description of MINIX, this book is nothing but good. As an operating systems introductions, one can find it a lot tiresome and confusing. Don't recommend buying it, specially as an introductory book."
2,Average book on OS,"The book focus on Operating Systems and includes source code of a mini OS called Minix. Till I read it, I always read rave reviews, but found it to be quite over rated. The pros of the book includes the source for reference, a Micro kernel OS design, while what is not really upto the mark is the language tends to be difficult thereby making a tough subject even more tougher, the author's view tends to spill over and are juvenile with cliches like all students are trying to hack systems, etc and does not cover various aspects of OS subsystems.My recomendation would be the book by Abraham Silberschatz, Peter Baer Galvin called ""Operating System Concepts"" incase of you are starting off or just want a very easy to read book or consider various approaches."
3,"I like Minix3, not the book","I like the microkernel approach to implement a UNIX-like OS. It is simple and elegant although it does sacrifice a little performance. However, the book is not particularly well-written. It lacked clarity in its explanation of both theory and implementation."
3,Some weaknesses,"(1) The CD does not include the Amsterdam Compiler Kit, which prohibits compiling the source code. (2) The authors made no effort in explaining the ports. There are two types of ports: physical and logical. The authors should mention the amount of physical ports available (perhaps 1024), and the logical ports (perhaps 65536 - 1025), how the mapping is done, and what are the 'meaning' of ports like 10020 required by some software. The authors should mention what the number means. (3) Some abbreviations should be described better. For example, what is 'BSS'."
3,Not the best basis for Operating System design,"While this book is good explaining theory and demonstrating it in the author's operating system, MINIX, MINIX is an insanely small OS. Now there's nothing wrong with that by default, just keep in mind that any OS you were to write in industry, etc would be way more complex.Also, beware, of the 1000+ pages, at least a quarter of that is a print out, line by line, of the MINIX 3 source code. (Approximately 30,000 lines...)Bottom line: Good for basic theory and understanding, but you would need to know much more to write a friendly OS."
4,"Historically Significant, Simply Complex","The operating system for this book, Minix, is the ancestor to the now wildly popular linux. The idea behind this book is incredible, step through some of the most important areas of Operating Systems using an open source OS which was intentionally kept very simple.Rather than a survey of all the capabilities of operating systems which we see in many other books, this book focuses in on five of the core concepts. It discusses design tradeoffs involved in selecting an implementation for any one area of an operating system and is a very respectable book from the man who wrote the Operating System in question. A Good book if you are interested in the deeper concepts of OS."
5,Well coverage for fundamental OS design,"First there was Unix, then Minix , now Linux. Before Unix became a proprietary OS, its source code was available freely, hence the codes were used by many OS courses in colleges. Then things changed and the source code is no longer free. OS books will only present theories but not enough source code to show the implementation. This book is different. The authors took an extra initiative to create Minix which implements many features of Unix (and Linux) and include it into this book. I believe that this is a very good book to study OS in depth. It is reasonable that some mind stretching is needed as the subject of OS is sophisticated and complex. Highly recommended especially for Linux and Unix devotees."
5,Great Job!,Great book !This book is for those who are looking to see how things really run!I am looking for a similar one on linux or FreeBSD. I hope that they will do it soon!
1,No a good book,"It is not a book that overview OS, but a book for people who would like to read source code. It is overloaded with details. I don't consider the book is for beginners."
4,Looking for sound advice? Look no further.,"I am thoroughly impressed with these speakers. I am no audiophile but consider myself technically proficient when it comes to Home Theater an Home Audio. I installed these speakers in the kitchen for my wife to listen to music while she cooks and visits with guests. I installed these speakers with Monster Cable 14/4 CL3 In-wall speaker wire. Installation is easy, sound is good, and the price is right. Fairly full sound and discreet. What else could you ask for? I give it four stars, not for a top end home theater, very good for whole house hidden music."
3,Not sold as a pair..,"These speakers are not sold as a pair like it says in the advertisment. Told Amazon about this weeks ago, nothing done to fix it....."
2,Not What I Expected!,"This game was too easy. I rented it three days ago and I've beaten it. And the characters are so block shaped. I say Resident Evil has the lead in the horror/action category. Now there's a game! None of those limited weapons! It is always long, you're always well equiped with weapons and the graphics are excellent. But this game was not what I expected."
4,Resident evil take-off,"this game is a great game, if you've read any of my other reviews then you know that i dont give games good reviews because i dont want to be mean, i speak the truth...this game is a definite take off of resident evil. the button control is the same, if capcom found out about this, jaleco would be in big trouble. i am giving this a good rating because it is like resident evil, resident evil is awesome. so this game is awesome. you should buy the game, but find a walkthrough for it, too because otherwise it would be too hard. This game is kindof cool, but it is worth the money"
3,Not bad,"Carrier is a pretty good Resident Evil clone for the Dreamcast. It takes place on a giant ship where humans are turning into hideous mutants - now thats original! But actually, it has a couple of neat innovations of its own such as the scope that lets you see who is infected, and the opportunity to replay the game as a second character. Its also quite tough to finish, but worth the effort. Mind you, the climax is such a rip off of the tyrant battle from RE1 that I'm surprised a lawsuit didn't follow! Should be going fairly cheap now, so pick one up."
4,Cousin of Resident Evil,"This game is so much like Resident Evil, it's not even funny.However, it's not exactly the same storyline. Carrier has a different unique storyline. It's just the gameplay, the angles and bad acting. Of course you got to have bad acting in one of these games. I give it four because Dreamcast didn't go over the edge using the same storyline as Resident Evil. Other than that it's a good game. Not a great game, but still good. I suggest you rent it instead."
4,Don't play at night !,"Don't play this one at night ! Not because it's scary. It's just dark and hard to see during the day ! This is a pretty good game ! Good sound, great solid grphics and models, Good story and it's a good way to pass the time until Resident Evil Code: Veronica. I bought this game on a whim and at first I had trouble getting the hang of the controls. Once that little snag got ironed out however it was fun as hell from then on! This game isn't that scary but can get nerve racking espcially with some of the masterfully crafted ambient sounds they use. The music is almost a parody of standard Sci-Fi horror. The graphics are good some of the characters are just plain goofy looking but the everything else is rock solid and clean looking. I recommed this fun little game ! It is a great way to warm up for RE:CV and a great way to get into the whole survival horror genre (if you havn't already)"
2,Carrier,"Ok, someone compared this game to Code Veronica. Oh no! This game not only lacks in graphics, but it lacks in weapons also. The guy that you control don't look bad, but the backrounds are terrible and make it hard to maneuver. I bought this game ....... new and found out real quick why. You get what you pay for. .........."
2,I should have just waited for Resident Evil,"First off, the game spends too much time back tracking instead of killing off mutants. There are times where I find myself spending more time looking at the map of the ship trying to figure out where I have to go rather than actually playing the game. Secondly, the camera angles absolutely, positively SUCK! More than half of the time when trying to kill off the enemy you can't see them. Furthermore, even when you're walking or running you not able to see what's in front of you. After a while it gets old and frustrating. However, the game has great graphics and sound. But even with that it still isn't enough to make up for the lack of lasting appeal. Also, the game is pretty hard to play if you don't have a manual or a walk through guide. There are so many things that you would not even think of doing that you must do in order to complete a level. I would suggest that you either rent this game first or borrow it from a friend before you decide to buy it."
2,Why?,"I must admit that I'm not a huge fan of survival horror games. Only R.E. 3 struck me as an engaging game. I figured Carrier would have been cool considering it was for DC. The sound, graphics and overall wonder that can come from a DC game will knock you off your feet. Then, there's Carrier. A worthless piece of tripe that is not fit for a coaster. The voice acting is TERRIBLE, the graphics are decent, the gameplay is boring and hampered by awful controls and there's nothing interesting going on in the game. Stay away at all costs."
2,Blue stinger and Resident Evil are better,Carrier is not great but not good.The game has horrible controls.Great Graphics.Good Sound.The game is a bad game.So buy code:veronica or Blue Stinger please.
5,Commentaries for the Commoner,"William Barclay's commentaries are written for the common person. You do not have to be a seminarian or theologian to understand his writing. Yet he is able to give historical information and Biblical interpretation that will add to your understanding of the Bible or enhance your lessons if you're teaching. The Gospel of John comes in two volumes, so don't forget to order v. 2, if you order this one!"
2,Get the Second Edition,"I have most of the New Testament commentary set from the hardcover Second Edition, which I obtained years ago. I had a few holes however, and did not have the two volumes of John. So I purchased a revised paperback edition. I was very disappointed. I since obtained hardcover Second Edition copies. They are out there, and they are worth finding and getting. I would pass on the Revised (edited) edition."
4,Audio Source AS5 S in-wall speakers,"I am using these speakers for rear surround. Installation was fairly easy if you don't mind cutting 6""x9"" holes in your walls.You CANNOT beat the value of these speakers. Sound good, look good...BUY THESE SPEAKERS!!!!!!!!!"
1,Not great....,"A brown ooozzz...it coats your face, sort of like a paint pigment. Never seems to really ""set"" and comes off if you wipe a towel or such across your face....oddly it didn't seem to streak though. Most definitely the worst ""tanner"" (if you can call it that) I've ever used."
1,Strictly Faces,"I have purchased this product many times over the years, just never from Amazon. I don't know if the company has changed the product, but what I received is nothing like what I have been using. The product is usually in the form of a 'lotion' consistency. The product that I received is a 'watery brown' consistency. I used it for the first time this morning and after shaking it up, opened the lid and half the bottle ran out in my hand, bathroom counter and onto my white bathroom rug, which resulted in staining my hand and bathroom counter and ruining the rug. If this is how the product is made now, DON'T buy it."
5,Works Great,This products leaves your face with a natural looking suntan. Not orange at all. Smells nice too. I would definitely recommend it.
1,Wish I could get my money back.,Didn't like this product at all. Wish I could get my money back. For a self-tanner it is very fake looking...not natural at all.
4,Golden Plow Jumps the Shark,"Prentice Alvin is the third book about Alvin Maker (nee Miller) set in an alternate American frontier where folk magic and hexes are real. In this story, teenaged Alvin finally makes it to Hatrack River township to begin his apprenticeship to the town blacksmith and meets the love of his life, Peggy Guester, the torch girl who saw his birth and has been protecting him from supernatural attempts on his life. Alvin also becomes the protector / father figure for Arthur Stuart, a young man born into slavery.Card tries to incorporate Alvin's progression towards his fate as a demi-god promised in book one, but it reads like a square peg being forced into a round hole. And the whole business with the golden plow... well, as they say about television shows, this is where Alvin Maker jumps the shark."
5,Alvin comes of age,"In this book, Alvin comes of age, finally getting education and training both as a blacksmith and as a Maker.The blacksmith training has been a bit delayed by the events in the previous book, but Makepeace Smith is still willing to train his late-arriving new apprentice, in his way. Along comes a teacher for the town, who is willing to tutor Alvin, in part. Who the teacher is, and what she does for Alvin, is a major part of the story. If you want to know more, get a copy and read it.The story FLOWS very nicely and is a superb successor to the previous books in this series."
2,Predictable,"In Prentice Alvin,Alvin is apprenticed to a black smith in Hatrack River when Peggy lives. In an attempt to avoid an encounter with Alvin, Peggy decides to flee to Philadelphia to apprentice herself to a rich lady. Just before Alvin arrives a young runaway slave and her infant son is found by Peggy and taken in by Peggy's parents.Later in the book Peggy returns in disquise as a school teacher.There is conflict in the story. The black smith that Alvin is apprenticed to becomes envious of Alvin's obvious talents, even though Alvin is careful not to use his knack. The Unmaker makes his presence felt and attempt to attack Alvin.The owner of the runaway slave attempt to get the infant back.Overall, the action is predictable and boring. Even though it's the third book, Alvin still doesn't know what his purpose is. Alvin goes to great length to build a golden plow, but even Alvin doesn't know why he built it."
3,"eh, it was ok","i LOVED Seventh Son, and Red Prophet almost made me cry. but this book, this is not as good as the prior two! i mean,i t's a good story in that you find out what happens to alvin and stuff, but it's sorta...hokey i would say, because the years pass by and alvin becomes such and such and you hear all about Peggy and how she's mooning over alvin,a nd all this other excess that i feel was...not unnecessary, but rather cheesy. whatever, apparently other people liked it, but i definitely preferred the other two. but don't let this stop you from reading it!! i love the Alvin Maker series. Orson Scott Card kicks major butt in the field of sci-fi/fantasy."
2,Let down,Many times while reading this book I felt the urge to just toss it into the trash. I read this book just for the simple fact that I am two books into it and have enjoyed the previous ones enough to continue. Slow moving and slow reading. Sad part is I will continue to read this series to the end because it does show some promise. We shall see.
2,Not Free SF Reader,"Yet more boring mormon wish-fulfillment fantasy. In this arena, David Gemmell he is not. If that is what you are after, then by all means get it, otherwise something like The Jerusalem Man will be much more appealing. You could, however, use them as a cure for insomnia, or sever lack of schmaltz."
2,Buffett Recommends Essays by Cunningham,"Just to complete the theme of the recent reviews, Warren Buffett at the Berkshire annual meeting in 1998 recommended Cunningham's Essays of Warren Buffett as the book to read about Buffett and investing if you are only going to read one. Having read them all, I'd say he's right, with this book by Hagstrom being on the list but not near the top."
1,"Read Buffett, don't waste time with Hagstrom","I bought it, by the title mentioning W.B.Wasted money: Whenever it comes to the details, he refers to his other book ""The W.B way"" (which I do not have, amazon ratings are poor though). Nothing wrong with the contents, but nothing new either. Just read the Berkshire Hathaway Annual Letter to the Shareholders (free on the web), with more and actually useful info. This book has ZERO value after reading the Letters, and this book ALONE does not quite help you picking stocks (although makes a good point in favor of WB's way)"
2,It doesn't add much to the understanding of Warren Buffett,"Don't get me wrong...the book isn't awful. It is just that it is more of a compilation of 3 sources of Buffett-isms and investment psychology than anything else. If you have read Warren's Letters to Shareholders, and Peter Bernstein's ""Against the Gods - The Story of Risk"", and have ever heard Charlie Munger speak, there is nothing new here. The author is a qualified mutual fund manager, and I commend him for not plugging his own fund throughout (though he does plug his first Buffett book many times.) But precisely because he has written 'one of these' before, I view this current effort as irrelevant. Go to the sources...get online, read the letters yourself, read ""Against the Gods"" and read ""Buffett - The Making of an American Capitalist."" Those give you much more color, flavor, and insight on what makes The Oracle tick."
3,Emphasizes the importance of a focused portfolio,".................................................I am still half way through this book. But I must say that I was impressed by the author's arguments in favor of a focused portfolio. Even if you picked 15 stocks AT RANDOM (out of a total of 1200 stocks), you would have outperformed the market in 808 out of the 3000 combinations that the author generated (i.e. 1 out of every 4). But the number drops to 1 out of every 50 if the portfolio has 250 stocks.Another point is that, of the 808 15-stock portfolios that did beat the market, a good number of them underperformed the market for as many as 4 or even 5 years out of 10. So, if you have a carefully-constructed focused portfolio and are trailing the averages for the last 2 or 3 years, there is no need to despair. Just stay the course and you'll do fine in the longer run."
2,Intellectual Lint,"Warren Buffett must find it irritating that his name is treated as a hanger for the tangential thinking of Robert Hagstrom in ""The Warren Buffett Portfolio"". When the author isn't quoting or paraphrasing Buffett, he is arthritically connecting Buffett's ideas with strangely incomplete summaries of tangential concepts like Kelly betting or Stern Stewart's EVA and Cost of Capital (the latter concept has been explicitly rejected by Buffett's partner, Charlie Munger). At the end of the day, this book looks like an investor's collection of idealogical lint and Hagstrom seems like an overrated exponent of Buffett's investment strategies. Thoughtful Buffett newbies might have found Hagstrom's previous ""The Warren Buffett Way"" only vaguely unsatisfying, but those who have read-up on Buffett in the interim since Hangstrom's last book will find this latest work a muddled and half-baked mess."
1,Essays by Cunningham is Better,"Hagstrom's earlier book made a contribution but this one seems intended only to try to cash in on the market created by that one. In between writings, Lawrence Cunningham published The Essays of Warren Buffett--a collection of Buffett's own writings that outline the philosophy better than anyone ever could. Hagstrom's current book only proves that point--perhaps a point worth making but it didn't really take a new book to do it. Cunningham's already did. Click on The Essays for lessons from the master himself."
2,Nothing but story,"This book give you a brief introduction to focus investing and its practitioner like John M. Keynes, Phillip Fisher, Bill Ruane of Sequoia Fund, Lou Simpson at GEICO and Charles Munger, VP of Berkshire Hathaway.There is no detail about how Buffett evaluate the stock because the author didn't know that much. That's why his mutual fund kept on buying FRE in 2008. While Buffett already sold off all his FRE positions in year 2000."
3,Confusing ragtag of quotes.,"I wonder what the aim of this book really was... It appears the author was impressed with Buffett's use of probability theory and expectancies of outcome on investments, and he wanted to share it with the world. But it seems the author has written this book before he fully understood the concepts, because this book is little more than a ragtag of quotes. The book lacks detail and practical how-to guide-lines. It often tries to draw irrelevant analogies. And the writing style of this author is generally confusing, because he relies so heavily on quotes instead of making a coherent explanation of the concepts himself. I've given this book 3 stars because it does have some interesting points for further consideration for people already experienced in Value / Focus Investing."
3,Comment in book description is so untrue!,"It says ""It's no secret that most mutual funds fail to beat the performance of the S&P 500. And if the pros can't beat the averages, it's not unreasonable to assume that most individual investors can't, either"".This is so untrue! Individual investors can quite easily beat the pros for many reasons. First of all, mutual funds have commissions built into them that they withdraw from your money. Secondly, the ""pros"" are mostly short term traders because they sacrifice long term returns for short term statistics so they can advertise their mutual funds with ""good"" returns. Many other reasons we can beat them can be seen on the Motley Fool web site: www.fool.com. Best investment web site on the internet for us individual investors!"
3,Oak Cube Shelf Set,Smaller than appear in the pictures. While I was able to usethem I felt deceived.
4,A Variety of Music,"I haven't yet seen the movie associated with this soundtrack, but I just got it as a gift from my brother, today. It's a very nice CD. It has a variety of Jazz, Electronica and Orchestra Music. I suppose if I see the movie, I may end up liking the soundtrack better. But for now, I give it four stars."
2,Mediocre for Benoit,"I have been a DB fan for a while but simply found nothing new in his latest effort. The beginning is basically the same as ""Fuzzy Logic"" and ""Right Here, Right Now"", and the whole CD's format is just too predictable and less jazzy than before. He's probably trying to be a bit Brizilian but just not quite there...Not impressive at all!"
5,another great CD,This is another must have in your Benoit collection. Great music in a classic Benoit style.
4,A Neat Little Gizmo,"One of these, together with two high capacity CF cards equals a pretty good home brewed 2.5"" Solid State Drive. I cheaped out on the CF cards, so the performance of my laptop is suboptimal in some respects. Installation time for new software is especially awful. However, on the whole, the performance of the laptop is improved. Bootup time is improved by better than 50%. Battery endurance is improved around 20%. Your mileage may vary, of course. Best of all, my laptop is completely silent most of the time now. Much less fan noise, no clicking read head, no whirring drive. If you have a couple of fast CF cards lying around, one of these gizmos will turn them into a perfectly fine Solid State IDE drive. If you don't have the cards on hand, it might make most sense to wait a few months and buy a purpose-built SSD; prices are falling fast now."
3,Not quite what it should be,"The product will not support two microdrives because of physical issues with the thickness of the drives and locations of the offset slots. I did get this to work with one 8Gb microdrive, but then it would not fit into my old ultra light Dell laptop because it was too thick. It is working fine in my Dell CPx laptop and runs silently, but just a bit sluggish."
3,ACTING NEEDS WORK,The message in this film very clear and goes on in the world today. Why marry if you don't keep YOUR VOW TO GOD SACRED? What you do in the dark will come to light. If a person is changing you and not for the better why do you feel the need to stay. Sometimes the things you pray to keep together God is trying to move you from it. BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU PRAY FOR & RECOGNIZE YOUR BLESSINGS. The ending sucked and could have been better. On a scale of 1-10 this movie gets a 6.
4,Life happens,"Its funny on how you can find yourself in a movie. This movie is like most other Black marriage movie but it goes further than the wedding day. Three friends and second guessing their choice of marriage. To find out they married a ""GIRLFRIEND"" not their life partner. When the fire goes out, you have deal with that person!"
5,Excellent Film With Fresh Talent!,"Length:: 1:53 MinsThis is an Excellent independent movie featuring actors James Winningham Jr, Michael Wayne Thomas, Kanroc, Loneta Edison, Teshia Thurman, Crystal Maywald, Kurvie Kapone, Chantal Nicole and Thea Renee'.Married Men and Single Women has very relatable and realistic storylines, great actors, fresh faces and I already know that anyone who sees it will love it because everyone who's seen it at all the tour premieres has loved it!The Houston, TX Movie premiere is January 13th at Landmark River Oaks Theatre 730pm CST and I can't wait to see it again. For details on this premiere visit [...]Original Trailer: [...]New Trailer: [...]I'm going to pre-order some more DVDs now! See you in January."
1,Worst acting ever!,This movie was made with $50 and a biscuit. I kept rooting for it to improve but it just got worse and worse. Horrible. If I made this movie and watched the final cut I would have thought...hmmmm I respect cinema too much to EVER put this out in the public. Obviously that was not the case with these film makers. It was so sucky that I felt like I should have been paid for being able to watch 85% of it before deciding I liked myself more and turned it off. Yuk.
4,darkness of light,this is a prime example of life in the fast lane the innocent the beauitful and the playboy its how you would want to be love and treated without the nonsense of lies and others bs if you really dont want to be married to someone then stay single and grow old by your self !
1,"poor acting, waste of time and money","the only acceptable actors were the extra's. It's hard to pick what I hated the most,cheap production, poor acting, unbelievable story line OR THE TIME AND MONEY I WASTED WATCHING ITMarried Men and Single Women"
4,This Makes you Think,Sometimes the actions we take have wonderful and terrible consequences and shows how we can embark on a path for reasons we think are justified and that it can lead to unexpected results.This really makes you think.
4,Viva Viva!,"Viva paper towels are excellent. Very absorbant, very soft, very cloth-like. The only problem I have with them, now, is the center tube. Kleenex has begun narrowing the diameter of the cardboard dowel so it no longer fits on my towel rack. (The single roll packs still seem to have the wider center, just the multi-packs have the problem.) Still, I find the towels themselves to be among the best on the market."
3,Great fit for my 3 yr. old!,"I bought these for a plane trip and they worked excellent for my 3 year old to watch movies on the laptop. They fit perfect on her head- comfortable and don't slide off. Plus, there is an adjustment so these headphones can grow with her. Even after the trip, she loved using them on the computer to play games. Unfortunately, afer only having them for a couple months and only using them occasionally, one of the ear pieces sound went out. Now, she can only hear out of one side. Fortunately, I was able to get a replacement, since they are still under warranty. I absolutely love these headphones and hope they last for years to come."
2,Not very durable,"While they worked they were awesome, but...We bought two pairs for 5&7 year old girls for a long car trip. They were great on the way there. On the way home one side of one pair stopped working, had to wiggle the cord to try to get sound back but couldn't get them to work for long. The other pair had one side pull out of the junction where it becomes 'one' cord."
2,Great...but broke quickly,"These were great headphones...right up until they broke on our first trip/time using them. They fit well, the volume control is perfect. Not too loud but loud enough that she did great on the airplane with them (even the tiny prop plane). She loved them, we loved them, and then...they broke. One of the ear 'wires' pulled out of the junction where they come together into a single wire. We got to use them for about 4 days total. So, not worth the money at all."
1,Poor quality headphones,"I purchased these because I wanted safe headphones for my four year old daughter. They lasted all of 2 months after only using them about 4-5 times. Now, no sound is coming out of the earphones. Very very disappointed. There are no good quality children's headphones out there currently from what I have seen."
1,very disappointed,This is my second pair of these earphones and the 2nd pair that one of the wires has pulled loose and cannot be re-inserted to get stereo sound. While they were working they were great but if you cannot keep them together there is a big problem with the design.
2,didnt last!,"We bought these and loved them but they stopped working after just 5 months. we live overseas so not much we can do, tried to have them fixed but no one seems able to so we will have to buy a new pair, and will not buy same brand this time."
5,My 20mo old loves it,I searched and read all the reviews to find a perfect headset form my 20months old. She is at the age of wanting her own electronics. This headset fits her little head perfectly and I like the sound quality. The s ame day we got it we went on a little road trip and she fell right to sleep with it. Now she uses it with her dvd player when are watching our own dvds at home. I am so glad I go this
3,Plug too thick to use with iPhone case,"I'm so disappointed. The earphones themselves are fine, but the connecting plug is so wide that it won't go through an iphone case. I have tried it with both the Speck pixel skin case (iPhone 3S) - which is fairly thick, and the Speck Candyshell case (iPhone 5) which is very snug. In both instances I have to take the case off the iPhone to use the plug. This is kind of a pain, since you really want the case to be on when kids are using it. I've been looking around for a ""skinny"" adapter but the only one I found was at radio shack and it was 6 feet long - i was looking for one that was about 2 inches. So if you were planning to use it with an iPhone case you might want to keep this in mind (it did work with an Yoobao iPad case, however)"
2,"Seemed like a great buy, but died after 1.5 months","My almost 5-year-old received these for Christmas (at my request) from his aunt so he would stop trying to steal my husband's pair of (much) more expensive headphones. For a month and a half, they worked wonderfully and seemed very sturdy. Then, suddenly, for no apparent reason, sound no longer comes through the headphones. When plugged into my laptop to play a game, the sound stops emitting from the computer speakers, but does not come through the headphones. Very sad day here for my little man. :("
3,My son doesn't like... probably his age,"I b]purchased these for my 1 year old prior to a plane ride. He was too little and just didn't like anything on his ears for very long. We really haven't used them since now that he is a bit older, but I don't think they would take the ""Handeling"" of a toddler for very long. It would be great if they had a storage case so they could withstand travel in a diaper bag or similar."
3,10 year old,"Would these headphones be good for a 10 year old, or would they be too small, or too ""babyish""? Thanks. I put a 3 star rating only because it made me rate the product, but I have no knowledge of it yet.________________December 12, 2011I have since bought the product since asking this question. I will still give it a 3 star rating. I bought it based on other people's reviews saying that it was okay for their older child. Maybe they have small children. I think the package should say for ages 2 - 6 or 2-5. And maybe rename the product Little Kidz Gear. The part that fits over your ear is very small. Also, I had tried contacting the company about a week before posting my original question and to date, I still have not heard from them. Not very impressed with their customer service."
1,Don't Buy It!,"I thought it would be worth a chance considering the bad reviews and the more numerous good ones. I bought this for a 7-year-old. She used it once, then one side went dead. It was a waste of money."
1,Wire connections on earpieces look very flimsy,"I bought these headphones for my 2 year old because they sounded quite durable.When I opened the package, I was disappointed to find the wires going into each earpiece were quite thin and unshielded. They did not look like they could make an hour without my active toddler creating a short in the line.Also, with a line into each earpiece, there is one more point where your kid can get caught in the line and end up pulling all the connection points.For this price ($25) I expect wire construction to be at least comparable to the Leapfrog brand headphones, not the same as the included headsets they offered with tape Walkmen in the 90s. Shoddy looking stuff.They are already boxed up to be returned."
2,Terrible buzzing sound,"The size is great. Perfect for a 5 year old, but the buzzing is not so good for a 5 year old and not good for her parents either! Wish I'd bought a different one all together!"
3,Great fit - Broke quickly,"These were a great size for our 3-year old to use with his Kindle Fire. They were super comfortable for him- and he preferred them to listening to the Kindle Fire without headphones. He could plug them in and adjust the sound. He used them all winter break- from Christmas morning until today, almost daily. They did last the trip across country.Today the right piece snapped off. If we glue it, it won't have the right rotating function. If we just try to snap it back together, it falls right off as soon as he puts it on.I'm actually probably going to buy a second set - maybe he was just too rough? Maybe the plastic got too cold? Nothing else fits as well. And this is the third type of headphone he's broken . . ."
4,Work well for kid's headphones,"These work very well for kids headphones. The sizing of the headphones are perfect for small children and they are very adjustable. Sound volume is okay and the built in limiter is a definite plus.The only reason I took off 1 star is because of the extensive use of plastic. We have other $20 over the ear headphones that don't use as much plastic in the portion that goes over your ears and connecting parts. These headphones also do not fit all the way down to our 2 year old though, so I'm not sure if you can make a direct comparison. I can only speculate on longevity, but it appears that these could break much easier than the other $20 headphones we own."
4,children's headphones,Headphones worked very well. The volume control is a nice feature. I ordered 4 units for my four grandchildren aged 8 & 9. One set lasted only a few months because the wire pulled out. I wish there were a way to repair them easily to extend the life of the unit.
5,Work great,Fit fine on a 3 year old and will go bigger as she gets bigger. Just make sure whatever is holding her hair up is out of the way. Can adjust the volume on the headphones themself which is good. Good purchase.
5,Great!,"My 3 year old loves this. The headset that came with our van does not fit so she had to hold it in place and it kept slipping, miserable for all. This fits her little head great!"
5,"Finally, a kid's set of headphones!","My kid cannot wear earbuds because they constantly fall out... These headphones are the perfect size for kids! Yay... finally! They work great and it's nice to have a volume option on the cord, too! They seem to be very comfy for my 5 year old, who refuses to take them off!"
1,"Used twice, then broke!","We have the same exact complaint as others here, and I honestly wish I had read these reviews before purchasing....usually when there are only a few bad reviews, I chalk it up to statistics, but we bought a pair of these for our 4 yr. old and used them 2 times on planes (for about 5 hours total). The next time we took them out to use them, the right earphone had no sound. I couldn't even jiggle it to get it to work. Prior to this, I really liked these! They do look great, have great fit, etc., but it's just not worth it if they are going to break. I contacted Amazon who refunded our money, and as much as I would like to, I think I will not buy another pair of these again. I am guessing until the manufacturer fixes this flaw, we'll be right back to where we started. I figured adding my review here might help."
2,Not sturdy enough for kids,These fit well enough and the sound quality is fine. But the cord is thin and delicate. I have replaced a set two times in several months simply because the child tugged a very little bit on the cord in one instance and for no apparent reason at all in the second instance.
5,Excellent headphones AND customer service!!,"We've had these headphones for about 2 months now and LOVE THEM!! Beside the fact that they're a wonderful product, the Kidz Gear company has an A+++ customer service dept. Case in point...strangely one of our headsets suddenly stopped working so I contacted Kidz Gear. And without ANY hesitation or question they apologized for the inconvienance and shipped out a new pair. Two days later we received them! So for that alone I applaud them! Way to go Kidz Gear!!"
2,"Great sound, cords short easily","We bought two pairs. I really love the sound quality and the over the ear design of these (for comfort and blocking a little of the ambient noise).However, the cords lasted two trips because they shorted out (sat on, yanked, whatever). It's not the kind of wire you can fix by twisting back together and taping it.I have sat on, twisted, pulled, washed, and overall abused my ""adult"" headphones and have had no problems, so why would they make a ""kids"" product with flimsy cords?"
4,"Great headphones, one tiny flaw",I love these headphones. They fit my 1 year old very well and the volume adjusts very easily so I don't need to worry about hurting his little ears! The only problem is the little extender headphone jack piece. It caused the headphones to only work on one side and they crackled a lot. Easily fixed just by removing this piece. The wire is PLENTY long without it.Overall I am very pleased with this product. It is strong enough to not break when being tossed around by my son :)
1,Didn't last one trip.,"We bought these based on all the good reviews. Unfortunatly, they did not last through one vacation with only one child using them in his Leapster and portable DVD player. The sound would come and go, and caused our son a lot of frustration."
1,Don't waste your money!,"I had originally rated this product with 5 stars; however, over the past 3 months I have changed my mind. At first, I loved these headphones because they fit perfectly and were very comfortable for my 2 1/2 year old boy (he does have a large head, so these were great :)). I bought them as a Christmas gift in 2011 to go along with his LeapPad Learning Tablet. Now it is early March 2012 and they are already not functioning properly. The sound is warped and low. They have been well taken of so I know it's not something that we did. I am very disappointed that I bought the highly rated, expensive headphones thinking that they would last. Don't waste your money on these headphones!"
3,"Fairly durable, but my daughter didn't think they were comfy","These puppies did last for 2 years of heavy use by my now 5 year old, but she complained that they hurt her ears. I could see her ears were often red after use. She's a tiny child, <3% for weight, but perhaps she has a strangely large head? They did seem a bit tight, but I was just happy they stayed on her head when so many other didn't."
4,Great kids' headphones,"I purchased these headphones for my 4 year old daughter to use on a recent vacation. On the airplane she watches movies or plays with her Fisher Price iXL video game. We previously had a set of Philips kids' headphones that were pretty awful. They were always falling off and she couldn't ever get them back on properly. These headphones had a much better fit. My daughter can put them on herself and they seem to stay on comfortably. One problem is that the volume-limiting piece seems to limit the volume to mute! I tried attaching it to keep her from cranking up the volume too high, but when it's attached no sound comes out! I suppose its a defective piece and I may get around to contacting the manufacturer, but for now these headphones have worked out just fine."
5,Product you can count on!,"I purchased two headphones for my boys ages 3 and 5. After one use of the headphones, one set stop working. I posted a remark on Amazon and received a phone call literally the next day. The rep from Kidz Gear was professional, apologetic, and just plain nice. It was such a refreshing customer service experience! A replacement pair of headphones was shipped to me, that I received within 3 days of the call. So my boys are back in business, using their headphones to play Starfall on the computer."
5,Great fit!,I purchased these headphones for my 3 year old daughter to watch movies on flights. They fit wonderfully and the audio quality is great. Very happy with the purchase.
5,These are the best kids headphones,"I've tried a bunch of different kid's headphones (Sony, Griffin, Califone) and these are the best ones. They fit well on a wide range of ages and they seem pretty comfortable. They're well made and have stood up to some abuse. Also, the individual volume limiter is much better than the across-the-board approach that other kids headphones take. Thumbs up."
5,Perfect fit,These headphones are a perfict fit for my 4 y/o. Have already traveled on one trip and headed out for another. I really like the volume control option and the fact that these fit over her ears and not inside the ear canal. She has trouble with those staying put. Highly recommend.
5,Great for Young Kids,My 2 1/2 year old deals with sensory overload/ASD symptoms. He is easily overwhelmed when we are out in new or noisy places. These headphones are a life saver for us. He loves music and it is calming for him. These headphones fit him so well and are comfortable for him even with is sensory issues. I just turn on his favorite music on the ipod and pop these on him when he starts getting overwhelmed and on the verge of a meltdown when in a new environment and he is able to remain calm. I love watching him dance and sing to the music when he has these on.I saw some kid headphones at Best Buy and Wal-mart for about $3 less than these are wast tempted to try them but I am so glad I went with these. The cushion around the ears is great for blocking out extra sound and stays on his little head very well.
3,not durable,"I had purchased two sets. Upon arrival one set broke within days. The wires came unattatched where the left and right ear wire merge into the single wire to the plug. I got a new set for free and less than a year later, the same thing happened. the ""Y"" connection is not durable at all"
3,"OK Headphones, but a little expensive","We got these for my two year old son when we were headed on a long car trip. At first, he loved them. We plugged them into the DVD player and everything worked well. After about an hour he was ready to take them off, and he wouldn't put them back on for the rest of the trip. He had no interest in wearing them on the way home a week later either. I don't think that they were uncomfortable, but not enjoyable either. For the money, I have seen other headphones that would have worked fine in the $5-6 range that would have fit him just as well. The headphones themselves are well made, with a volume control on the cord for easy adjustment. They are made for small heads and small ears.The package arrived on time with some other items, and was well packed in the box."
3,Not so durable,One side of the headphones broke. Not very easily packed up. Would get a different brand next time . Okay for the price
5,Great for kids!,We bought these to go with a dvd system for our car. They held up well to the abuse of three kids on a cross country road trip. The volume adjustment is easy and you can make sure it never gets to loud. They fit our 3 and 7 year old without any problems.
1,STOPPED WORKING,"After a few months of use, our headphones just stopped working! I have tried figuring out how to use the lifetime warrantee, but haven't had any success with Kidz Gear. Perhaps the warrantee is worthless."
2,Great while they lasted,"Comfortable fit, great sound, but died after 6 months. Not even abused or anything, actually used rather gently, but just suddenly died one day. Kinda sad considering how nice they seemed at first."
3,"Great idea, but needs better execution","My four year old needed headphones for his DVD player. Kid sized head phones seemed like the perfect thing.They look great and are comfortable. The plush ear pads help block out ambient noise. The size is good.My biggest problem is that the cords are so thin. For something designed for kids, they should have thicker, more durable cords. My son broke two sets of cords in a year. (I tried soldering it back together, but the wires are so thin, it didn't last long)."
4,Works Well!,"These headphones worked exactly as advertised. My 3yo daughter had a great time with them on our flight cross country, and kept them on the entire time ... so I guess they were comfortable! I only wish they had some way to retract the excess cord as there is quite a bit of it."
5,Best headphones for toddlers/preschoolers,I have been looking for headphones that fit toddlers/preschoolers and were actually comfortable and these are perfect!
5,Silence is bliss...,Our 3yr old son loves his new headphones...especially because the resemble his Dad's. We like the headphones for the volume control and comfort. Highly recommend...no problems with purchase through KidzGear and Amazon.
3,"Great Idea, Poor Quality","My 4 year old daughter wore this once before complaining that there was no sound coming from one ear. Took it apart and found that both wires had completely detached from the speaker. Made repairs, but was disappointed that something that is supposed to be made for kids is not very durable.The size is great for little ears and has a detachable part that restricts the volume, but we find on car journeys that we have to remove it because the sound is so feint."
4,Works on the airplane,These are quality headphones they cover the whole ear; we were only able to find earbuds at Best Buy. No problem hearing the video on the airplane which is why we purchased the headphones. Now our 3 year old likes to wear them at home with his little DVD player.
4,great investment,"I purchased two pair of headphones for my 3- and 4-year-old children. We have wireless headphones for the dvd player in our van, but my son pulled off the ear padding on both sets. I love the padding on the Kidz Gear b/c they won't come off. Also, the kids have Leapsters, which come with earbuds. However, they have a hard time keeping them in their ears. The Kidz Gear headphones are perfect for this. The only downside is that the headphones have cords. But, that is how they are advertised. The cords are plenty long enough to use in the van, but they do hang down from the dvd player. We just have to remind the kids to be careful with them. Overall, this is a great product, especially for the price."
2,Good while it worked,"I purchased these headphones in October for my daughter to watch her dvd and play her nintendo ds without disturbing others while we travel. She used them a maximum of four times, after each use the headphones were stored. By April of the following year, she was complaining that the headphones had no sound. Indeed after jiggling the wire the sound came in and then left. I'm back to the drawing board looking for a kid-friendly headphone."
3,I wish the kids used them more,"The headphones fit our 5 and 3-year old just fine. The cords are lengthy and the inline volume adjuster is handy. I only wish they wanted to wear them more. The car screens have speakers, so the boys don't want to wear the headphones. When we make them wear the phones though, there's no complaints. For your very little ones, you'll want to put them on first to try and set a reasonable volume for them. The volume limiter is handy as well for keeping them from blowing their ear drums out.Buy the headphones for those car rides where you just don't want to hear what your kids are listening to."
5,Perfect for our 3 yr old!,These fit our 3 yr old very well. They're adjustable so fit our head as well; they are comfortable to wear and the sound quality is great. The volume control is a nice feature.
4,Good Product,"Work very well for my children. Great for on the plane with the loud jet engines. A little bit on the cheap side as far as materials and construction, but will still do the job. sound is great and they are able to control the sound on there own which is also great."
4,Great headphones for toddlers,Bought these for my then 2 1/2 year old son for an airplane ride. They worked great and he loved them. Size is perfect for toddlers and big kids alike.
2,Hurt son's ears after 1 hr.,"We bought these for a 1100 mile each way road trip for our 3 yr old son. He wore them part of one movie, said they were hurting his ears, and wouldn't wear them the rest of the trip..."
4,An Exciting Book!,"This was a good effort by David Hagberg to use the notorious reputaion of Saddam Hussein to cast him as a villain in a book. Saddam,after losing the Gulf War,attempts to obtain a nuclear reactor to buils an atomic bomb. He sends his chief enforcer who his a backgroumd in terrorism(1972 olympics for example) to obtain his reactor. His enforcer is accompanied by his ruthless daughter. The only one to stop this group is a German detective. This book has plenty of action and will definitely keep you reading. Once again Hagberg proves himself to be a good writer. He has once again come through with a good book."
2,Not so good!,"The cover to the book said something like ""Hagberg now takes his rightful place alongside Tom Clancy and Clive Cussler."" Not with this book he doesn't. This is a quick read with a lot of shoot 'em up but it is a dime novel along side either Clancy or Cussler. It is an OK read if you check it out of the library, but I wouldn't recommend adding it to your personal collection."
1,If you like crap. you'll like this,"Ohhhh Jaleco why have you forsaken yourself? Premise of the game is you have to save your girlfriend (ooo originality). This game wouldn't be so bad if it actually had action in it. But unfortunatly this game has none, you don't even get to walk around. Which wouldn't be so bad if it had good graphics, but it doesn't. If your hoping for good puzzles this game isn't for you, because the puzzles often make no sense at all! After ten minutes of the game I wanted to hunt down the creators of this game and beat them with a golf club. This game would of gotten two stars if it's name was thuggernaut. And the people that said this was good were high as a cloud. If you buy this not only will you waste your money and time, but also your life because this may ruin video games for you."
1,YOU DO NOT WANT IT!,"If the selection of material in this calendar is as poor as it has been previously, then you do not want to buy it. The articles to denote gener are not given with any of the featured words. I was always taught that it was culturally incorrect for words in this language to stand alone. Further, the phonetic pronunciations are only given for the featured words. There are no pronunciations for any of the phrases. Also, there is no continuity from day to day, and the phrases are so ""far out"" that they are hardly worth learning. I would not recommend this calendar to anyone who truly wants to learn the language."
5,FoodSaver 1.5 Qt Rectangular Canister,Works great! I use it to marinate meats and veggies. About 20 minutes after you seal it; your food is ready to grill.
1,Great idea - lasted a month,I bought this and several other Foodsaver containers. This one developed several stress cracks and now does not hold vacuum.
4,"Mixed bag, but worth it","Another live album from Marty Haugen and David Haas, this one includes quite a bit of Jeanne Cotter's work songs as well. I don't feel this album holds up as well against ""Come and Journey"", primarily because I'm not a big fan of Jeanne Cotter's songs (although she has a wonderful voice). David Hass puts in the strongest showing, including the very moving ""Wherever You Go"". Most of Marty Haugen's songs are more somber than usual though ""All You Works of God"" is an upbeat, welcome addition to the album. So, I don't think this album is as strong as ""Come and Journey"", but it's quite a good album anyway."
5,Really beautiful,"This is a very beautiful tape. It is cheerful to listen to the music, and I enjoy it just about every day."
3,"Good system, but no station Lock.","While this system does get good reception and the headphones work very well, the dial for tuning is on the edge of the unit and I found that it is always getting bumped and making it's way to another station or to just plain static.If this had a station lock or presets it would be a great radio, however it does not."
5,awesome!,"i love this powder! it works incredibly well and smells great! it is soothing and pulls away wetness! unfortunately, the one store i could purchase this product at in the mesquite area, has discontinued this line! i hate the store doesn't carry it but i'm thrilled i've found it here!"
3,"Not a heavy blend sweater, sizes run one too small","I had to return this at first and exchange it for a size larger, minus one star for it not being true to size. However it went through the wash and dryer without shrinking.This is not a heavy blend sweater. We were hoping it would be a good 50/50 blend for working in a NE winter, with this being one of his layers. But it is a fall jacket at best. And since I had to pay to return the sweater, it ended up costing me $32, minus one more star.If all you need is a wind breaker type deal, this could work for you."
2,Not the type of Polo material im accustomed to...,Unlike what these other customers are saying... the material of these polos feel very cheap... i bought 5 of them because i was convinced the material would be as described... its not... i received these shirts in a box... no packaging no tags no nothing... im very dissatisfied with this buy... the shipping however was great for what its worth...
4,it gave what was needed,"The book gave what was needed and some more: how to beat each misson with flying colors, detailed descriptions of every civilization, strategies on how to win at multiplayer, and much more. the only down side was that if you buy this the game loses some of its chalenge."
3,A pretty well rounded guide except for one thing......,doesnt really have any useful stratigies for deathmatchers(and theres a lot of us out there!) but it covers everything else pretty thoroughly. it's worth it just for the run down on the new civs and the changes to the old ones.
5,a very good book for a very good game.,gives you helpful tips for the capaigns and tells you about the civilizations and thier uniqe units.
4,"Outstanding, much improved over previous DVD offering","Though I'm a little miffed that I have to shell out another $20 per set after buying the complete original three series, I welcomed this remastering and have not been disappointed- mostly. The sound is vastly improved (good bass and some decent use of the surround channels) and the video, while not perfect, is leaps and bounds better than the original DVD and TV offering. It has bright colors and remarkable clarity, but there are compression artifacts from time to time. Another minor annoyance- the original box sets included a third disc of bonus material. These sets do not include those. It isn't worth rebuying these unless you want the best possible quality video available or if you don't have the originals."
2,WHAT,Harmony Gold seriously must give this series to someone who will do it right. They really need to sell the rights to the series to someone like Pioneer. This is just ridiculous and their bumbling DVD production is killing what is one of the best early anime series to make it over to American shores. I was waiting for this one and I feel really let down.
4,Tan buena como la recordaba.,"Si no compraste ninguna de las ediciones anteriores de la saga de macross esta es muy buena opcion. Despues de a√±os de esperar un dvd de Robotech en espa√±ol llega este, con una buena traduccion auque no la original,buena imagen y el exelente sonido.Exelente opcion para todos los fans de la serie!!!"
1,Destroyed a little bit of my childhood,"I purchased this is in memory of the little boy who woke up early to watch robotech; unfortunately, robotech is awful. The program is written for a bright five year old or a dumb 10 year old. The plot barely makes since and the animation is stilted at its best. Save the memories of your childhood and don't by this."
1,Robotech Legacy coll great! Remastered a waste!!,"I would just like to say that from what I've read about the remastered version it sounds like Harmony Gold cheaped Out! I'm sticking with The Legacy DVD boxsets, they have all of the episodes and the episodes look pretty good and sound good as well. My advice to any Robotech newcomers and those that have been fans for years STICK WITH THE LEGACY BOXESTS BECAUSE THE REMASTERED VERSION DOES NOT LIVE UP TO IT'S NAME!!HARMONY GOLD! RELEASE THE RIGHTS SO IT CAN BE DONE RIGHT!!!"
3,Es una farsa la version en espa√±ol,Si realmente son fanaticos de la serie de robotech en espa√±ol y tuvieron la oportunidad de verla en los 80's se van a desilusionar del material las voces no son las originales y sobre todo estan planas en la expresion eso si el audio 5.1 es increible pero aun asi no me convence el color de los graficos y sobre todo las voces. Es una version totalmente comercial para los nuevos pero es una farsa.
3,No a bad indy action film,"Treasure Raiders pulls some storylines from big budget films, but it is catchy and action packed. Alexander Nevsky is larger than life in person and in the film. If you like street racing films and a little adventure, you will like this one.*Sponsored Post"
1,Never again,"Really bad experience. The product did not come with the charger and usb cable either. And a after spent some money buying the accesories the camara stop working. I sent an email to the seller and he offered to reimburse me 50% of the cost. It was an insult to me. Well, never again with this seller."
1,Not that good,"The first one only lasted Two Days! Only used once other time in the next month, the next time I tried to use it on vacation that month it was dead again. The battery door is too week to keep the battery down against the spring and in contact with the contacts. Unless you keep pushing on the door the camera is dead. The camera has nice features but not if it doesn't turn on."
2,Wonderful camera - but it fritzed out within 3 days,"I researched several cameras in this price range before buying the Olympus, and was extremely happy with it - until it ceased to function properly (a heavy gold tint to every picture, with horizontal bars across the image) after three days, just as I was beginning to shoot a 50th birthday party for my best friend. I don't feel comfortable buying another, as obviously I have a better chance of getting another lemon. I'll be getting a bulkier but hopefully more durable Canon."
2,Nice size - too fragile,"When i got the camera, I was looking for one that would be a nice small size to fit in my purse so i could take it everywhere. It's great and compact and all.. but i dropped it once and now it has problems. It sometimes shuts itself off with the shutter still out. It takes a lot longer to save and view pictures now. I always had canon cameras before and they survived multiple drops before showing any problems.The good things though... the camera seems to have a pretty good battery life. I was concerned with the big lcd and no regular viewfinder, but i don't have problems with the battery. The pictures are ok, but low light images don't look very good a lot of the time. the image stabilization is a nice feature that i do use often though."
2,so sorry I bought this one,"This camera's size is perfect. However, the pictures it takes sure aren't. I have changed the quality of the pictures too and it really doesn't make a difference. If you use the zoom, the picture quality is horrible. Even if you don't use the zoom, the picture quality is not as good as my old large Fugi 2 megapix. camera."
2,Blurry pictures...,"If you are looking for blurry photos, this is the camera for you! I loved the price and the size but come on! My 8 year old Canon powershot (3 megs) make MUCH sharper pictures than this camera. Do not buy this camera. Took it back, got a Casio Exilim EX Z600, very, very happy. I'm not some big photo guy, Christmas, vacation, that kind of thing, was looking for a small digital camera. Thought, what the hey, they have had to gotten better after 8 years, this one hasn't. Was very disappointed. If you do buy this camera, make sure you get it somewhere with a good return policy because I think you might be using it......"
1,Dont Buy This Game,I was so looking foward to playing this. I'm one of those geeky types who loves watching robots smash heck out of each other. So I thought this would be an ideal title for me.Heres why you shouldnt buy it.The robot build feature is totally lame. Blank spaces in the weapons menu make you think that this game was not finished b4 it was released.The AI is way way to easy to beat. I became the champion at my first attempt!!! The AI robots dont attack they just sit there and let you knock hell outta them!Wizard works should be ashamed of themselves for releasing this utter excuse for a game on to the market. Ive played free shareware games that are 100 times better than this.JUST DONT BUY IT ITS THE WORST GAME YOULL EVER PLAY
1,To easy,The game was fun at first but the creators were in to big of a hurry. The computer is to easy to beat and there is no way to change the difficulty level.
3,The fun does not last long,"This Game is fun at first,but after about a month or so it gets boring . There are 7 opponets and arenas . Even though you can build your own robot, You are limited to too many things . After awhile you will find yourself doing the same thing over and over again. Most of the other robots are very easy to defeat and you will get bored after some time.This gives you more weapons, wheels and harder opponets. You can also go against someone on the same keyboard . All of this adds about another month to the fun, but you will still get tired of defeating the same robots over and over and you will be hungry for more action.P.S. you should search for Robot arena Design and Destroy, you may like this game more."
1,This Game sucks,"Do not buy this game. It has a lot of potential, but the designers for this game were in too much of a hurry. The game will not save, causing you to lose the bots you create. I thought it might be the CD so I returned the Game and Same thing happens. This game is not even worth 1 Star. DO NOT BUY IT."
3,No physics engine!!,"This game has a great premise, but there is only one problem - there is no physics engine, meaning that you cannot push, shove, crash, flip or toss any robots which are common tactics on shows like Robot Wars. The design areas are skimpy, and the movement is sometimes jerky. All this will supposedly be fixed in the next release, ""design and destroy"", so that would be a better buy. But if all you want to do is pound other robots with hammers and saws, you can try this if you want to."
4,Great cleanup saver,"Have ordered all sizes and clean up is great. Use for baking rolls, fries, meat, etc. Husband will not using baking pan without."
3,Not his best...,"First off, I can't speak to the classical allusions, as I'm a complete Philistine. This book didn't transport me the way Rushdie's earlier works did, and I've read them all. The passages on rock music and America just ring hollow. I didn't feel the connection with the characters and immersion in the story that's made me go back to, say, _The Satanic Verses_ again and again. Perhaps, during his period in hiding, he saturated his brain with Thomas Pynchon and David Foster Wallace, as it seems he's made a decided effort to write a maximally huge, sprawling, at times tediously madcap novel replete with hidden, acronymic conspricies. (He even weaves in a bit from ""The Crying of Lot 49""!). For me, I'll still take _The Moor's Last Sigh_ and _Midnight's Children_."
2,Unfortunately,"It is really the five stars that scare me.....this novel is only so good as you avoid all the others who have done this ""genre"" before. By genre I mean the rock and roll novel, the spectacle, and the myths we place upon those persons. Rushdie is about thirty years too late to pick up the mantle of Thomas Pynchon, and it shows: where TP's songs resonate with creativity, Rushdie's are more along the lines for the older Sting/ Will Smith crowd. Something I think is a mistake in the book is thinking music remains the same for all generations, that the enthusiasm is the base element in equal supply throughout. This isn't so--music takes many forms and different guises and means many different things; and it proceeds at a brutally quick pace. Rushdie would have done well to not have studied his U2 buddies so much. The world has passed them by, and what he thinks he encapsulates slips out his fingers as easily as a hand misses a chord."
2,Please make it stop!,"First, I only got to page 63. Second, you would need the patience of Job to finish this tome. Does Rushdie really have to say something three different ways in one passage? You know, part of art is knowing what to leave out. Apparently, Rushdie feels this would pay him back for his time in writing this, to leave everything in. I wish someone would pay me back my time for reading it. Also, one of characters-Ormus father?-does this twitching muscle thing whereby he twitches each muscle on his bare torso to amusement or derision of others....there can be no better metaphor for Rushdie's work, than in this character's habit. Being able to say something many different ways & even ELOQUENTLY is no reason to do it. It should be necessary in the context of the story. Not just doodling about just to doodle. It's self-indulgent, mannered writing, less in the service of story, than in letting ego roam wild. Where is the editor when you need them?"
1,Rushdie rips-off Dick,"Actually, I haven't read the book, I just wanted to express my dismay at Rushdie ripping off the real life experiences of Philip K. Dick, whose work should be read (not just appropriated):Ormus's twin brother died at birth and communicates to him from ""the other side"""
2,not his cup of tea,"Good writing and style. But he does know anything about pop music and, incidentally, pop is the book's core."
1,Worst Book Ever!,"Hawai'i reviewer and Victor Charlie, I'm with you. Self-indulgent doesn't even begin to describe it. I actually threw this one against the wall!! It has not yet made its way to the garbage can...instead, I am mailing it to a friend of mine who got three pages farther into the Satanic Verses than did I. It was the last book either one of us was unable to finish, so I can't wait until she calls me to tell me that she got as far as chapter 5 and threw it in the garbage!! Why even pick up Rushdie again, you ask? I guess I just couldn't deny someone who wrote such engrossing, beautiful and compelling works as Midnight's Children and the Moor's Last Sigh another chance. I will not be so foolish again...give it a miss."
2,More cluttered than a Bombay night market,"I returned this book to the library barely halfway through. It appeared to be written by a pretentious Classics Ph.D candidate with a thesaurus in one hand and a meerschaum pipe in the other. Rushdie gives you two sentences of plot, then spends an hour waxing philosophical about a multitude of obscure things, which, while interesting on their own, become such a mishmash of misplaced ideas that the whole thing just loses its momentum and the interest of the reader."
2,"Like ""Midnight's Children"" ... minus the good parts","While not unreadable, Rushdie seems off his game in this one. Compared to the genius of ""Midnight's Children,"" ""The Satanic Verses,"" and ""The Moor's Last Sigh,"" the novel reads like a B-side. What was most off-putting was his reliance on cliches and tired idioms. Cliches were used as a crutch, not as something that's subverted."
3,Moderate masterpiece,"Salman Rushdie's setting is always mesmerizing. His language vultures clssical music into my ears. His problems with the GOD idead are stil the same. Always. Not bad though. The idea that religion cause war and it is better off irriligious is accepltable, but it feels like an ache under his tooth that he can't write without anymore.On the other hand he definetly missed out on the rockstar world. I have never been part of it either and he talks about it the way I would. Which is embarresing and lacking knowledge.Still, Salman Rushdie books are unique in the art of literiture but I need them to become more entertaining and not purpose driven.Moderate masterpiece"
5,"Great, as Always","Rushdie delivers a perplexing and interesting novel, as ever. I'm not even going to try to explain the plot. I suggest taking a class on Rushdie- his books go that deep. I have enjoyed everything that I have read so far. This is a great novel, whether you are reading it for school or just for fun."
5,"Until now, Rushdie was a tease","Until this novel, Salman Rushdie was a tease. Yes, his words are musical and magical, inventive and playful. And yes, his characters are complicated and real.But I knew I was missing half of what he wrote. Who caught the targets of his allusions? Not me. I don't know the Koran (Satanic Verses) or the history of Pakistan (Shame) or India (Midnight's Children).Now he has written something for me. Set in India and London and New York, the references and allusions are all to rock and roll. Elvis, Ike and Tina, Dylan, Madonna and U2 are obvious. Less obvious are David Bowie, David Byrne, and the Clash. But they are all here.And the story is moving, easily the most emotional work he has crafted."
4,SPEECHLESS!,"This is one of the times when someone feels that whatever he might say, it won't be enough!Reading ""The ground beneath her feet"" was one of the most revealing times of my life. Never again had I felt this way...and Rushdi..what an inspired man. His writing made me think and his story reminded me how one book can change so many things: from the way you see life to the way you share your heart and your love..."
3,Rushdie on autopilot,"This is one of Rushdie's least successful novels. He relies too much on mythologies and puts his usually wondrous prose on autopilot. He simply becomes lazy, allowing for the readers' knowledge of mythology to inform the characters, rather than the author. All is not lost, however, as Rushdie on an off day is still enchanting. And when he writes of those loners on the outside, there is a chilling warmth to his empathy."
2,Wears Out It's Welcome Too Soon,"This being the third Rushdie novel I've read (The Satanic Verses and The Moor's Last Sigh the other two), I have to give him credit for creating memorable characters and being a master at conveying colourful and textually-rich settings. On the other hand, I also feel he is long-winded to a fault and, particularly in the case of this book, in great need of some further judicial editing. Vina, Ormus, and Raj are all terrifically interesting characters when the reader first meets them; however, after 300 pages or so, one finds they aren't particularly likeable and the remaining half of the book just kind of chugs along without a whole lot of momentum or purpose. (I did like the final two chapters though)."
3,"If you want Rushdie at his best, read Kleier","Rushdie had his moments with ""Satanic Verses,"" but it's been downhill ever since. Once again, he never seems to get firm footing with ""GROUND."" Verbose, overwritten and self-indulgently wandering. Unquestionably, the mantle for outrageous satire has passed to Glenn Kleier, who has earned the title ""The Salman Rushdie of Christianity,"" with his provocative ground-breaking novel, ""THE LAST DAY."" If you've not read Kleier, I strongly urge you to do so. He will more than entertain you until Mr. Rushdie regains his footing."
5,A Great Collection,"Rushdie is in top form here. It was a wonderful, satisfying novel that I thoroughly enjoyed. Bravo to Rushdie who is truly a great writer."
1,"He'll be very sorry when he pass away, because of his books.","This man has a chance to see the truth each day on his life. If he becomes a real Muslim this will be his rescue on this world and beyond... Anyone who will read his books, must also read books about Islam to have balanced knowledge... PS: Learn about Islam and be informed..."
5,Could not put it down!,The master does it again. Only Rushdie and Pynchon make me savoir each word in a novel. This book is a joy. I am sending copies to all my friends.
2,love Vina - miss profoundness,"I got through and loved Vina. However, The Ground Beneath.. wasn't deep enough to compare to the incredulous Moor. Mr. Rushdie, I believe, does not have an as profound or grown knowledge of the Western culture as no doubt he has of the Indian (like no other). Thus I find the story less convincing and catching (at times I was about to give up). I miss the deep underlying understanding which to me has characterised Mr. Rushdie's phantastic past works."
2,"Two-dimensional characters, muddled plot","This is a brave attempt at retelling the Orpheus/Eurydice myth in a modern, rock 'n' roll context. And you can't fault Rushdie's skill with words. The puns and allusions fly thick and fast. But he fails to make any of the central characters anything more than cartoonish. Avatars, he'd say. Add to that the problem that the plot wobbles from one improbable event to another. It's hard to swallow the idea that two essentially boring characters -- Ormus and Vina -- could produce the kind of world-shaking music Rushdie credits them with. There's a sneering tone about real stars like the Beatles and Elvis, which many may find annoying. But then, he's always been anti-Western culture, perhaps as much as he has been tagged anti-Moslem. Far too long, too."
2,"""Play 'Free Bird""! ""","I have a great deal of respect for Salman Rushdie's work. I have been a serious student of his novels for several years now. It is thus with regret I must report that his current novel, ""The Ground Beneath Her Feet"", is the textual equivalent of a lighter waved in the air. It takes Rushdie over 500 pages to say, in essence, ""Play 'Free Bird'! Yeeeaaaahh! "" This is an unfortunate turn of events, to say the least. The novel is undisciplined and self-indulgent, melodramatic and maudlin. It is, in short, a midlife crisis of a book. The story of over-sized, one-dimensional Celebrities, ""The Ground Beneath Her Feet"" fails to engage the reader or create any sympathy for its spoilt, unpleasant protagonists. Rushdie's readers have come to expect better. It is to be hoped his next book will be less of a disappointment."
1,Quite disappointing,"Rushdie's editor was sleeping on the job...At 575 pages, this is just way too long...rushdie doesn't break any new ground on this one...the writing is tired, the characters flat and reading the entire book is a just a waste of one's time...Absolutely hollow...I guess he peaked with "" Satanic Verses""...since then it's been downhill"
3,"O.K. , but should have been better","When this book is good, it's very good. The English scenes where Rushdie writes like an accessible Pynchon are superb. Really, the first half of the book is terrific.The later problem is Rushdie is so concerned with his 'spin a yarn' conversant style that he loses touch with reality. Example : One of the major characters has a brother who is a serial killing, mass murdering lunatic. The fact this would be too huge an issue for anyone - not to mention a celebrity - to ignore is barely addressed. By the time at the novel's end when it is 'resolved' you've kind of quit caring because the whole dilemma is given, maybe 8 pages in a 600 page novel. The book has bright spots - namely the first 300 pages. It just seems Rushdie was too self conscious about writing an epic and using style over substance. Not a bad book-, but not a great one either."
3,He's lost his muse,"Rushdie is a master of prose, but along with that craft mustalso come a story. Alas, in the final analysis, THE GROUND BENEATH HERFEET is simply boring. Some nice language play and nifty phraseology, but no real story. In reading through all the reviews here, I see where some readers have recommended an alternative author, Glenn Kleier as the ""Salman Rushdie of Christianity."" I've read Kleier's THE LAST DAY, and concur. THE LAST DAY is brilliant, bitingly funny, and hugely provocative--which is what Rushdie used to be (and hopefully will be again). Until then, I direct you to Kleier for an exciting and challenging ride on a razor's edge. But I admit, I will sample again Mr. Rushdie's next effort."
3,"If you want Rushdie at his best, read Kleier","I've said it months before and it's still true: Rushdie had his moments with ""Satanic Verses,"" but it's been downhill ever since. Once again, he never seems to get firm footing with ""GROUND."" Verbose, overwritten and self-indulgently wandering. Unquestionably, the mantle for outrageous satire has passed to Glenn Kleier, who has earned the title ""The Salman Rushdie of Christianity,"" with his provocative ground-breaking novel, ""THE LAST DAY."" If you've not read Kleier, I strongly urge you to do so. He will more than entertain you until Mr. Rushdie regains his footing."
5,"Strangely, a much-needed portrayal of Jewish women","I can understand how the religious would be offended by this work; it's got all the ingredients that would offend religious people.But - but but but - I also have this to say.As a Jewish woman, I'm tired of turning on the TV or going to a film and seeing negative portrayals of Jewish women. In film, actors like Ben Stiller are routinely - and almost exclusively - paired with blond, WASP leading ladies. This sends the wrong message. It makes Jewish women feel bad about themselves, and gives Jewish men the message that something is wrong with Jewish women.Nimoy's work will not seem ""Kosher"" to many.However, my immediate, gut emotional response - was to seeing an attractive, sensual portrayal of a Jewish woman on the cover, even if it was somewhat ""immodest"".Does this represent me as a Jewish woman?I sure hope so!Does Fran Drescher?Absolutely NOT.THANK YOU, Mr Nimoy, for a much-needed celebration of Jewish femininity."
3,Good Photographs of Nudes from Leonard Nimoy,"Leonard Nimoy shows that he is as fine a photographer as he is an actor and film director in ""Shekhina"", his first monograph of photographs. These are beautiful, sensual photographs of Jewish women and are in themselves, an intriguing photographic exploration into Jewish femininity. And yet Nimoy's work doesn't quite rise up to Edward Weston's or Robert Mapplethorpe's in its ability to inspire or to infuriate the viewer. To his credit, Nimoy demonstrates his technical acumen in lighting and composition. However, I wish his work was visually more interesting."
2,"Poor art, poorer taste",I don't want to grace this book with a lengthy review - there is little redeeming about the photographs and his attempt to blend sensuality with religious symbols comes across as gratuitous sensationalism. A banal swan song for the former Yiddish-theater actor.
1,USING WOMEN'S BODIES TO SELL,"An open letter to Leonard NimoyDEAR LENNY,LENNY, YOUR BOOK WILL SELL BECAUSE OF ITS ARTISTIC SHOCK VALUE...HAD YOUR PERFECT MODELS HAD THEIR CLOTHES ON, YOU MAY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MAKE A REAL CONTRIBUTION TO THE DEBATE ON WOMEN'S RELIGIOUS EXPRESSION. USING WOMEN'S BODIES TO SELL THINGS IS PRETTY COMMON...YOU'VE JOINED THE CLUB.bruce birnberg"
2,Dragon Seed,"Game was not what my son thought it would be. Played for a day, and was done with it. Vender did a good job getting it to us, but again I would not order this game again."
4,Good as it can be,"I just love this game. Its not Pokemon, its not Monster Rancher, and its not Digimon. This game is pure stratedgy not luck. I love the fact that you can raise dragons to battle and watched them evolve and with available dragons on PS save data, you can have more and more dragons (16 actually). My point is... I got no point!!! Play the damn game!!!!"
4,This game is cool but I won to quickly,"Dragon seeds is an awsome game. I really like it, but it was quite easy to figure out how to get the dragons levels up fast and win (and I wont tell you so you can figure it out for yourself). The graphics were good for the time the game was made. It seems to be a good storey(I like how the junk man and the shop owner are fighting all the time), and I will enjoy playing it for a long time."
4,"Looks good, smells bad","I recieved the leather ipod case in a very timly fashon. It looks great, however the smell from the ""keep it fresh"" packet was so bad that I couldn't use it. Other than that it was a great deal and it looks good."
4,Works fine,"Very good case the ipod is very protected and secure, the thing that I do is that I put to my ipod a screen protector and cut the plastic that the case bring so I get a better look of the screen."
3,Joanna Pacula Can Still Play the Femme Fatale!,"I've been a big fan of Polish Actress Joanna Pacula since the early '90s (Black Ice, Under Investigation). Still sensual and stunning at 47, she plays a role similar to one she played in 1993 (Every Breath), that of a woman who plays a dangerous game with her husband. Also of note is the actor who plays the chief police investigator - he brings the energy level of the movie up whenever he shows up. A minus is Richard Grieco, who walks through his role like he's sedated. There is a twist at the end, which I enjoyed. The South African setting was also a nice change from the usual LA/NY setting. For Pacula fans, a step up from her recent movies!"
2,Look Elsewhere,"I found this book to be a vast waste of time. There is very little of practical use to the trader. The author spends the majority of the book on his ""Triple Crown"" of reducing taxes. None of which you can do without a CPA. You would be better off visiting this book at your local bookstore, jotting down the ""Triple Crown"" and then hiring a CPA to explain it to you. The writing is poor and difficult to follow -- not because of the technical difficulty, but, because the sentences and paragraphs are so poorly constructed. Save the $( ) and look elsewhere."
3,Acceptable,The cardio part is not very well cued and the movements change at a too fast pace (too little repetitions)..in the end you feel rather confused than worked out..the rest of the DVD is ok with nice/some new exercises.
2,Great for beginners but no real challenge here.,"I must agree with disappointed. I too was disappointed with my purchase after reading the high reviews here. This DVD is a good place to start if you are brand new to exercise but will become repetitve and boring quickly. You get one short cardio, one short lower body, one short upper body, one short Yoga (I'm not sure if I would call it Yoga), and one short Pilates (again, not to my standard) workouts for the whole week. You are supposed to do these same workouts over and over. Muscle has ""memory"" and will easily adjust to these workouts. The key for me is to stay CHALLENGED. I have been using the cardio, upper, and lower body workouts on this DVD 2x a week and am not challenged at 7 months pregnant! Leisa Hart is a great instructor but has mislead the public with the claim that you can re-shape your body with this GYM IN A BOX."
4,Great variety,"I just bought this DVD and am very excited to start on my own weight loss plan. The Personal Trainer section is great and offers many different combinations of the workouts. The pilates and yoga sessions are energizing and relaxing. The cardio workout is a little complicated at first, but I imagine repitition will help. I love the idea of having a different workout every day of the week. And once I get back to my ideal weight, I will still be able to use the video! I'll be able to use the ""Take It Easy"" or ""Mantenance"" Programs within the Personal Trainer. I recommend this video to anyone who's bored with walking or stationary workout equipment - I sure was!"
5,It actually works!!,"I love this exercise video. I actually bought a second copy to loan out. If you follow the diet, do the 30 min workout 5 times a week, and occasionally do some of the personal trainer workouts, you really can lose 5 pounds and 1 inch off of your waist per week.After doing so many other diet and exercise combos it was astonishing to find one that actually worked.The 30 min exercise is broken up into 10 minute segments of aerobics, kick boxing, and pilates, which made it easy to follow and less likely to get bored and quit."
5,Great workout!,"If you want an intense, low impact 30 minute workout, this is it. Great directions, an easy to listen to personality and a quick, not boring workout. The 30 minute workout is great for travel, since you don't need any equipment. The other sections require weights and a mat and are good too."
2,A little too much...too late,"This video promises to loose a dress size in a week. And ok, sure...it could happen. If you can keep up with this lady. I found the cardio section of this video to be very complicated and confusing. First she shows you the move and then moves to the next one before you have time to really even figure it out. And then...she moves to add about 5 or 6 of these moves that you can't even follow together into complicated routines. That just really annoyed me that she didn't spend the time to explain how to do each move, and just dove right into them. She doesn't stop and promt you to what's next. She completely dives in with all her clothes on and pushes you in with her. I found it really abnoxious.She's mixed a variety of styles of exercise, and I guess for someone looking for a taste of everything, there it is. But I hope you can keep up and don't mind tripping up for the first week or two trying to get the routines down."
1,Thank God for the old stuff!,"What the heck hapened to the blues? I was raised on them, and I always thought it would be around. I was wrong. The best way to describe this album is LAME. The only song that's even descent is burden, and guess who sung it? I'm all about an artist growing. I really enjoy that part of music. I have enjoyed seeing where Johnny Lang is going. However, this isn't growth, it's regression. If this was a demo tape, no one would listen past the first 5 seconds. Where's the heart? the passion? Am I the only one who needs this in their music?"
2,"KWS, play the guitar, let Noah sing","I have been waiting patiently for 5 years for a new KWS album. Live On was a good 4 star album. However, this is not worth buying. KWS is not a good singer, and the 2 stars I gave were for the 2 songs Noah sang on. For a while, I thought KWS was doing Lenny Kravitz cover tunes.As with Johnny Lang's last album, very poor effort - trying to be too commercial and trying to stray from what made them popular. Goood musicianship."
2,Horribly Disappointing,"Like many others I had eagerly awaited the release of this album. KWS's first three albums were so fantastic and I expected this one to be at least as good, if not better. Unfortunately, it falls far short of my expectations.There are only two songs on this album that aren't absolute disasters - the two featuring vocals by Noah Hunt. Kenny's vocal talent is mediocre at best and is totally unsuited for the type of music he is trying out on this album. It seems that KWS is searching for himself with this effort. Unfortunately, it seems he has lost himself in the process."
1,THIS IS BLOODY BAD,"JUST TO SAY THAT THIS STINKS IS NOT ENOUGH.ANYTIME YOU HAVE A TALENT LIKE THIS THAT IS WASTING IT,IT MAKES YOU WANT TO PUKE.THIS DISC IS THAT BAD.KENNY WAS A VERY TALENTED BLUES GUITAR PLAYER ON HIS FIRST THREE CD`S AND NOW HE IS TRYING TO BE MR POP STAR.I THINK KENNY HAS BEEN WATCHING AMERICAN IDOL TO MUCH BECAUSE HE SOUNDS ALITTLE LIKE CLAY AKINS.COME ON KENNY,PULL YOUR HEAD OUT OF YOUR ASS AND SWALLOW YOUR STINKIN PRIDE AND GO BACK TO WHAT YOU DO BEST,WHICH IS PLAY THE BLUES.THIS CD BLOWS.I JUST WISH I COULD GIVE IT A ZERO STARS ITS THAT BAD.PLEASE DON`T MAKE THE MISTAKE I DID BY BUYING THIS."
1,a stunning stylistic shift (from blues to lame),"Much like the Dave Mathews Band, The KWS band changed their sound so they would get a broader market share - gone are the funk and the blues.Now they are Britneyfied. This album contains the same boring pop smear that is on every radio station from country to rock to pop. Same lame cliche'd lyrics, same flavorless accompanying music.This is the reason CD sales are crashing. No one wants to pay for the same music they can hear on any radio station at any time of day."
2,Growing Pains,"KWS is clearly trying to stretch his wings on this album. He does the majority of the vocals (for the first time) and has definitely diverged from his previous albums' style of SRV and Hendrix styled electric blues guitars.I don't begrudge him, or any artist, the attempt to grow and find his own artistic identity. This attempt, however, was a failure. Rather than being progressive and eclectic, it's scattered and unfocused. He sings a few songs, his (former?) vocalist sings a couple (and makes you wonder why he wasn't allowed to sing them all), he attempts a ""modern rock"" sound, tries a ballad or two, has a forgetable duet with Kid Rock, and even throws in instrumental.It's a shame. I was hoping (expecting?) he would be the dominant figure for decades to come in the blues/rock genre. From the sounds of this album, he's specifically (and disappointingly) chosen to defy that expectation."
2,Very Disappointing.,"I've read the reviews on Amazon and am relieved to know that I'm not the only disappointed customer. Being a huge KWS fan, this new CD was a complete let down. I listened to it over and over again, hoping it would grow on me. Whoever is singing the vocals sounds like they have a nasal problem. I miss the rock-bluesy sounds of the previous CD's. Kenny, go back to your old style because this new style just isn't YOU and you have a lot of disppointed fans. Sometimes change is not for the best."
2,What happened?,"KWS was blazing a trail. The blues rock gunslinger that every fan of the genre was holding as the torch bearer. My chin hit my chest as I heard Lenny Kravitz spewing forth from the speakers. I could've sworn I put the new KWS CD into my dashboard CD player. I popped it out, checked the label and stuck it back in, making sure is was set on CD and not crappy FM formula radio. No, it was KWS. I listened through, a couple of flickers of quality music, few and far between. Most ironically is the title of ""Ain't Selling Out"" which could be nothing more than a ""Please don't hate me"" plea. Oh, and a Kid Rock guest job, crikey! Next up, Eminem and Jay-Z with Sheryl Crow and Ice T's come-back.Better luck next time, Kenny."
4,Give the guy a break!,"Grant it, this is a departure from the blues, BUT how can you not like this recording (assuming you like RnR) Give him credit, he always has made leaps (not always as big) but be honest, he has been going in this direction since the first release.As far as copying Lenny, again, give the guy a break, his voice is what it is. It's not his fault he sounds a little like Lenny. BUT CLEARLY, Kenny's out put on this recording is a TON better than what Lenny can crank out.Come on, all the good ones make changes and move on. Be thankful he is a ""good one"""
1,"sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry customer service!!!!!!!!!!!!","I would like to say that I will never order anything from Amazon.com again!!!! I never got my package to start, and they tried to charge me $11.98 for SHIPPING!!!!! How dare you!! I wound up canceling my order and buying the CD from a local store. Lots cheaper, and I did not have to wait 13 days to find out they lost it........"
5,The best full album i have heard in a long time,"first i would like to say that this is not like any other kws album. i have read a lot of reviews of disapointment about this album for a turn from the normal kws album. here are my thoughts a lot of people say he was going to be the next stevie ray vaughn but what people dont realize is that he is not srv and never will be and to me that is a good thing because if he was we would never hear something this good. i am extreamly impressed with this album and it takes a lot for me to say that. If this is his new direction, or if the directions keep changing i bieleve that this is just the begining of greatness in music. You can tell from the songs that this is something that has been in the works for a long time and makes me wonder what other great songs and directions kws will take us in."
2,What Could of Been,"I hate to criticize music, seems to be too many people doing so and its all quite subjective anyway but I was confused as to what direction Kenny is going on this disc. The blues, totally gone and as far as a rock effort goes its not bad. However, Kenny taking over most of the vocals duties from Noah was a serious mistake. Kenny's voice is alright but it lacks that distinction that makes Noah's vocals stand out. I think if he wanted to release a rock album he should of called it by another name because fans of the blues are going to miss out big time on this disc."
2,Is this Kenny or Lenny?,"Dude sounds like Lenny Kravitz on this record... He needs to get Noah Hunt back in the record. It's kinda arrogant of him to misuse Noah in this manner since he's half of what made the band great in the first place.I'm not so surprised that Lenny errr Kenny has made out an album with so much generic stuff. Lets be real folks, like Jonny Lang, Kenny isn't truly a bluesman. He's more of a poser and posers true colors tend to come out sooner or later. Well, it's happend here with Mr.Sheppard.I hope Noah goes a finds a band that can respect his talent and the role he played in making the band good. The only good songs here are Alive and the other two songs sung by Noah."
1,The Place You're In,"Very disappointing. I'm glad I didn't waste money purchasing a new CD. Kenny Wayne Sheperd should stick to playing the guitar and leave the singing to Noah Hunt! If Mr. Hunt is not singing on the next CD, I certainly won't buy it."
1,Disappointed,"If your looking for what we heard on KWS first couple of recordings you wont find it on this CD. This recording findsKenny doing most of the singing in a more Heavy Metal style,sounding a little like Lenny Kravites.I dont like the stylechange, the guitar is ok in some of the songs, but the hooksand the songs arent very good. Unlike Kenny's first couple ofCD's these song's wont grap you or stay with you and you wont want to hear them again and again."
1,"KENNY, KENNY, KENNY, LENNY, LENNY, LENNY...","What a huge letdown...after waiting all of these years for the new KWS we get a poorly done Lenny Kravitz wannabe albumn. Kenny should let Noah do the singing and let himself do the guitar work. Speaking of guitars, this albumn was sub-par for Kenny. I thought that maybe after all of these years he would have gotten much sharper with all of the practice time he has had. Maybe he was visiting with Mr. Brownstone a little too much...I don't know? When people are comparing KWS to SRV, expectations are VERY HIGH. This albumn is by far the worst one he has put out. The only bright spot I could see was the song Noah sang in. Kenny, clean up and go back to your roots...ELECTRIC BLUES!"
3,Good news and bad news... (2.5 stars very middle of the road),"First, the good news:Rock and roll isn't dead, a prime example is on this CD. It's good rock, not my favorite, but acceptable.Okay, the bad news:This isn't the blues CD I was hoping for. You don't hear the fabulous KWS guitar as strongly as you have on his previous collections. Maybe if I forget it's Kenny Wayne, I'll like it better.Definitely listen to the samples before you buy this. If you are set on a blues CD, you need to look elsewhere. If you're willing to listen to Kenny Wayne Shepherd no matter what he does, give this a fair listen, and then decide. I'm on my second play and it's 'growing on me' but I don't have that instant affection I have for Kenny's blues.Rebecca Kyle, May 2008"
2,Disappointed,"I too was disappointed in KWS's departure from the unique soulfull bluesy style he once had. This new album impresses me as a B grade alternative music soundalike. My young daughter has dozens of albums that sound like this, except perhaps for the few residual guitar riffs that KWS is still capable of. And Kenny should please, please put Noah back on all the vocals or he should get his own band. He is way too talented to be relegated to 2 tracks."
3,EVERYBODY Changes....,"If I had rated this album after the first time I listened to it, I probably would have given it 1 star. But after listening to it over the past couple of weeks, it really has grown on me. Yes, I was disappointed like the rest of us that were expecting ""Shame, Shame, Shame"" again, but every band in history changes. Remember Zeppelin 3????? How about Pink Floyd Animals???? People change. Styles change. Things happen in our lives that move us in different directions. Buy this album and give it a chance. You cannot tell me that ""Be Mine"" is not a sick song..... I do prefer Noah on vocals though."
4,I give him my respect now.,I'll admit that I have always been an SRV fan and when KWS first came about I was looking for someone to fill that void. I just never put him up there with the greats because he didn't take that leap to let his voice be heard along with his fiddle. I know some people just don't have the voice but I think to win over fans you have to take that chance and on this album Kenny did just that. And let me tell you it pays off. He doesn't try to be SRV and that's a good thing because he has his own sound and that deserves so much more respect than if he was trying to be someone else. I know alot of people will be turned off to his new sound but I'm not one of them and before people decide to let this one pass they should really give it a listen. I really think you will appreciate this album much more because of the step he's taken to showcase all of his talents.
2,Why screw up a good thing ...,"I was of the impression in music that if you had a good thing going you wouldn't want to mess with it ... Noah Hunt vocals and KWS guitar is some of the best rockin' blues I've ever heard, but Kenny just ain't no vocalist. Not kinda, not even a little bit ... I was extremely disappointed with this album, but it did motivate me to do some emergency research to make sure Noah was still singing - so it served some purpose. Please, take note of the reviews, Kenny - go back to what works and share the road with Noah!"
1,This Stinks!!,KWS has sold out. Kid Rock? Where is Noah? Worst sell out by a supposedly good guitarist since Lenny K.
2,Overrated,"Kenny Wayne Shepard is so overrated that it is a joke.He has had more help than any of the other young guns out there since his dad is in the music buisness. That is the only reason that Kenny Wayne is so well known. Sure he is a decent player, but when I think of the other young guns out there, Joe Bonamassa comes to mind first , KW is way down the list in talent.This particilar effort is his worst so far, it's like he is trying to go to more of a straight hard rock thing and is getting away from the blues/rock that was on his earlier albums. And he can not sing, sorry KW stick to playing the guitar and let poeple that know how to sing do the singing.Stay away from this album, it is a waste of money, I sold mine at a second hand cd shop for a quarter of what I paid for it and am glad I got that."
2,memo,"Memo to the reviewer a few reviews ago:SAMSON was the Bibilical strongman who owed his strength to his hair.Hercules (Heracles) was strong because he was the son of the chief god in ancient Greek mythology, Zeus."
2,"Kenny, get back to your roots!","This album is a disappointing departure from the signature, blues rock sound of KWS. Kenny seems to be hunting for a new musical persona, with varied results resembling Lenny Kravitz, pop rock, and progressive rock.Kenny, embrace your destiny. You were born for blues rock. Come home.It's ok to sound like Stevie Ray Vaughan, because he's dead, and someone has to keep making that music we love. And while I do love Lenny, you are not him, and your talent is wasted emulating him.It's time to have your woman leave you again, start churning out the blues, get the soulful Noah Hunt back on the mic, and come home to your millions of loyal fans."
3,Not what you're expecting...,"I love all types of music, but the blues has always been one of my favorite genres, and to that end I have been a longtime fan of Kenny Wayne Shepherd. You can imagine my surprise then when I popped this disc in and not only did not hear any blues but in its place heard... grunge? alternative? generic radio-rock? I'm not really sure. Other reviews on this page were not exaggerating when they state that if you heard this disc for the first time without knowing who it was, KWS would be one of your last guesses. For what it is, it is not bad. Kenny Wayne Shepherd is actually a good singer, and of course he still wails on the guitar, but this album will have the same effect on KWS fans as Load did with Metallica fans. Newcomers might think it's wonderful, but longtime fans who have much higher standards will be sorely disappointed."
1,Kenny Wayne who?,What's the deal with this album. Whatever happened to Kenny Wayne Shepherd? Big disappointment. Is that him singing or is somebody making tennis raquets out of cats in the recording studio? What hapenned to the guitar virtuosity from the previous releases? I think Kenny should listen to Ken Lemberg's work on Pocket Xplosion's second album 'impact' and go back to his chop's filled guitar albums.
1,"I Have The Blues,,","After such a long wait from one of the most aspiring young BLUES players of this era - comes The Place Your In - a sad cross-road has been taken here,, This CD is a far cry from previous outtings from KWS,, I can't wait till he's over this phase of his life and bring the BLUES back,, SRV must be shakin his head,, - On the Bright side Noah comes thru as usual,, I have the BLUES over this CD.."
1,Don't bother buying this cd unless you need a coaster,"After waiting on a new album for 5 years I am so bummed that this is what he put out. The songs are way too pop rockish. I am so disappointed with this new CD. Kenny's singing on TPYI sounds too much like a demo recording and not a real album. It reminds me of Karaoke of Bon Jovi or Lenny Kravitz songs. If you're a KWS fan just keep playing the other albums he made with better producers, song writing teams and better singers and just try to forget about this one as soon as possible."
2,What the crap is this???,"Marti Fredrickson, remember that name! Cause he may go down as the producer who killed the once hot Blues guitarists that were known as Kenny Wayne Shepherd and Jonny Lang. In 1 year Marti Fredrickson took both of these next SRV and turned them into crap! There is no blues at all. Where the hell did they dig up this producer anyway? Do not buy this album, it is radio friendly garbage!"
3,Interesting...,"I find it rather interesting that a guitarist with such a fantastic blues style and huge following would change directions so drastically. It kind of resembles Jonny Lang's recent shift in that the style is completely different. Don't get me wrong, the music is good, its just that it isn't what his fans are used to hearing from him and it gets lost in a sea of other artists that have a similar sound. A good comparison would be a recent Jonny Lang concert that I attended at which he barely played his guitar and the music was largely unrecognizable due to the artist making ""creative changes"". If you are a blues fan like me than you'll probably agree that we can only hope that both of these artists will someday find their way back to the blues roots that made them famous."
4,Open your mind to great music,"Obviously, the majority of reviewers for this album are fans of the blues, not fans of Kenny Wayne Shephard or good music in general. This is a great blues-inspired rock album. I could have done without the Kid Rock song, but everything else is totally solid. There is plenty of the soulful playing that made KWS a star, it's just that most of the songs are a little more upbeat. I like blues and rock, so I think this is a phenomenal album that steered KWS away from the rut into which he had been settling."
2,Kenny-Where'd You Go?,"Hello? What is this? OK it's not the KWS Band, too bad. As a KWS fan who's traveled as much as 300+ miles to see him, I must admit that I wouldn't go a block to see this! I like so many others was hot to get this after such a long wait. Perhaps Kenny waited too long, like Jonny Lang's Long Time Coming. The only bright spots on the whole cd are ""Believe"", and ""Burdens"",which are of course Noah Hunt's vocals. Kenny you cannot sing, do what you have to to get Noah back! Where's the blues? And the Kid Rock thing, ""Spank""(cannot call it music) what in the ""h..."" is that?! Kenny go back to what you do well. I will have to listen to samples here before I buy any more from you. Too bad."
2,I thought I had made a mistake and bought Lenny Kravitz,"Kenny, it was worth a shot buddy, but let Noah back behind the microphone.I downloaded the two songs Noah sings onto my I-Pod and gave the CD away.You are one of the greatest guitarist I have ever heard and a pretty good singer but Noah's deep bluesy voice is what makes the Kenny Wayne Shepherd band great."
5,Outstanding !!!,"I must admit, I'm a ""Johnny Come Lately"" fan. I've known Kenny's stuff over the years and really liked his style.But, I was blown away by this new album.It is rare that an album comes along, that I can say I love every song.Sure, a few I feel are stand-out cuts, like ""Be Mine"", ""The Place You're In"" and ""Burdens."" But every tune is top notch.I have gone back and completed my Kenny Wayne Shepherd collection, but as great as they all are, I must recommend new and old fans give this disc a wirl.Outstanding !!!!"
2,Disapointing Change in Style,"I must say that I was disapointed by the latest album from KWS. The tremendous blues guitar work that is the halmark of the first three albums is missing as is the stand out vocals of Noah. ""The Place Your In"" is solid enough as a basic piece of pop/rock but bears no comparison to earlier albums, Trouble Is or Live On. KWS fans should make sure they listen to this new album before purchase as it is totaly different in style to his previous work. Good luck to Kenny I hope he has commercial success with this album, however its not for me. I'll wait until he serves up the blues again."
1,What did I just listen to?,"Can someone please tell me: A)what happend to Noah Hunt, and B) why its no surprise that the two best songs on the album are the ones which feature him on lead vocals? Yeah ""Alive"" is a decent song, but imagine it with Hunt on vocals. KWS... if I wanted a three doors down CD I would have bought one. Bring back Noah!!!"
1,How Sad,"That they are begging fans to come over here and write a good reveiw for this latest,but far, far from the greatest release.KWS in my opinion never sounded like SRV; to me the only thing they had in common were heart and passion.I would have loved a good rock album from KWS but what we got is GENERIC INSEPID PAP...Kenny I'm sorry but the fact is you can not sing.You have an extreamly talented vocalist in Noah Hunt to bad your ego got in the way."
4,Kenny Wayne Rocks Once Again,"I will start out by agreeing with everyone that is not his best album by any means, but I will also say that it is very good. The sound is different from the first three but it is still some great guitar.I really like all the songs. Alive is one of my personal favorite KWS songs. The Place You're In is also a great one. Noah Hunt appears on a couple tracks and his voice is just amazing. The final track A Little Bit More is an instramental and rocks. Different from other KWS albums but still good in its own way."
5,"Not what you expect, but great anyway","Be warmed. this is not the Blues that you're expecting, but it is good tunes. Give it a chance; it seems like almost all of the greats like to experiment (Clapton, Beck...). All in all, it will make for a nice live show; where he'll still play Blue On Black, Voodoo Chile, Slow Ride, King Bee, Shotgun Blues, Born With A Broken Heart..., and then throw in Alive, Hey, What Do You Say, and others.Also, if you're more into the KWS Blues stuff, he has a DVD/CD project coming out in 2005."
1,5 years & now this piece of ****?,I didn't even want to buy the album after hearing 4 songs off the kwsband.com website. Kenny's singing is terrible & there are no real blues oriented songs on the album. I've waited 5 years for this? Complete waste of money!
1,Not Impressed,"While my child enjoys the story line and the pictures, I am not pleased with the content. I skip 2 sections when I read this to my toddler. In the first part I skip, the main character asks ""Who is the original dumb blonde?"" in reference to Goldilocks. That is unbelievably inappropriate! The second part I skip is when the main character uses the word ""stupid."" I had to check the age range for this book .... certainly not a good sign if Mom has to censor the book when reading aloud."
2,"Nice Illustrations, Poor Story","I was impressed by the illustrations, but little else. The illustrations are what make this book readable; it's not really a picture book that kids will enjoy. I got my copy from the library, and seeing as how it hadn't been checked out (ever in a year), it's obviously not popular. And, there are a lot of fairy tale references, particularly on the postcards, that most children won't even understand. Heck, even I didn't get that the initials were fairy tale characters until almost the end. I wouldn't recommend this book."
1,Disappointment,"I purchased this bear for my grand daughter as a learning tool for dressing herself. The tie doesn't untie, the buckle is cheap rings, and the zipper doesn't totally unhook so that she can not learn how to connect and then zip. No snaps... no real buckle, useless tie. and the button will be difficult because it is larger than the hole. Do not waste your money look for something that is better quality. I trusted the Gund name... big mistake!"
5,Fun and educational!,"I purchased this for my 4 year old last Christmas and he still plays with it. The outfit closures were great in teaching him how to button, buckle and zip. The bear has been washed several times and has stood up to lots of hard play. Very, very pleased with the quality of it!"
5,Great Teach Me Toy,"I gave this as a baby shower gift to some friends of mine who are both fire fighters. I was very pleased with the quality of the bear, but expect nothing less from a Gund bear. The bear will allow the child to practice tying laces, buttoning, buckling, velcro closures, and zippers but until she is old enough to do all of that, she can just have a teddy bear to love."
1,May work on nicer chalkboards...,"but it does not work on our little Ikea chalkboard. Granted the chalkbaord is not very nice, but I would think it would work. It may work very well on nicer chalkboards or white boards, but if you are looking for something for a cheap kids chalkboard, this may not be right for you."
2,NOT GOOD QUALITY,"Wasn't what I expected, it didn't feel like an old felt eraser does, but I bought a different one from the same seller and it is much better."
3,One pointer,"Eraser worked great until it got wet. After that, it has not been the same or erasing all that well."
4,No inside details,"The book is interesting and worth reading, but if you want inside info or details from Begin it is not in this book. I had to look up the (in)famous bombing of the King David hotel on Wiki."
1,Poorly crafted,"I really wanted to like this book. The plot's premise and its characters are intriguing. Unfortunately, I found the book to be marred by the author's clunky writing style. There are too many characters and story lines that are clumsily drawn and that never coalesce. After awhile, it almost became punitive reading."
2,This book is work,"While I appreciate the author's ability to convey this interesting character study, I find it to be more toil than entertainment. However, I'll probably be a better person for having read it. . .if I live that long."
1,The Summer reading blues,"6 weeks ago I picked up this book, looking forward to another great Oprah pick. Boy, was I wrong. I compare this experience to having to read a Summer reading list selection during my high school honors English days. You know, the books you absolutely do not want to read but you know you have to or else you'll fail some sort of test. The test with this book was simply not giving up and making it to the end. The sentences were too wordy, the story was undeveloped and the characters were empty. The summer of 1999 will forever be remembered as the summer wasted on a bad book. Sorry Oprah, better luck next time."
2,Enjoyed it but I'm alittle confused,"If someone gets the pig symbolisim I'd be interested in learning how to figure that out. I never get it! I liked the book but it took me a long time to read it. I loved the characters and liked the overall story. I did get lost sometimes. I wonder if it's a book that is better the second time. I wouldn't suggest it to someone who only reads a few books a year I'm afraid they might give up reading. It was a effort but again, I liked the story and I'm committed to finishing books. Enjoyed the ending"
2,Requires diligence to get through.,"Thank you. I thought it was just me rereading pages to try to make sense of the whole story. I'm still struggling to get through this book, but, like others, determined to finish it."
4,"Excellent, intricate, for the more sophisticated reader",This book is a great tale of two worlds that collide. Its written in a very different prose that some find hard because the facts are interwoven within the story vs. just given to the reader.
4,Not For Teens....just an educator's thoughts,"While I enjoyed this book, it is not a book for teens. The reason I say this is because, upon doing a search for books for and about teenage African American girls, this selection appeared. Were the girl over 16 and a mature reader, perhaps. But for readers ages 13-16, not a good selection. There are too many scenes of violence, sexuality, and other questionable, adult issues for me to recommend it for the teen audience."
5,The Best Book I have ever read.,"This book starts out seemingly confusing. Too many characters are introduce in the beginning. I made a list to refer to, so I wouldn't get lost. Once I began reading, I couldn't put the book down. It is full of characters and their lives. It is written so beautifully that I felt as if I was actually there living it. Melinda Hayes's discirption of people, their lives, and what they are thinking makes you feel as if you actually met the people and know exactly how they are living their lives,because you are actually experiencing it. I can't tell you how much I enjoyed this book. I'm not talented like Melinda Hayes."
5,Best Ever,"The last thing anyone needs is to read another review of this book, but I had to get a positive rating up there. Just finished this book today and I have to say it is the best I've read in a very long time. I am disappointed at the average rating this book is getting because I thoroughly enjoyed this book. There are so many mystical moments in this story - i.e. when Valuable meets Joody in the woods for her first ""reading"". I've never experienced writing such as this. It is poetry."
3,Mother of Pearl,"I am conviced you have to be southern to get this book. I liked the book because I was born and raised in the South. I gave it to my neighbor who was born and raised in Arkansas. We both liked the book. You have to feel for these people. They are just so ignorant. It goes to show how much we all need education. They are not stupid people, they are just ignorant. There is a large difference. We southerners all know sad people like these. The language is a bit hard to grasp unless you lived there. Some talk about bad writing, how about bad living. Just thank your God you had a better way of life.Thank you."
5,A wonderful story full of interesting characters,"I really enjoyed this book. In most books there is one main character but in this book there were many interesting ""main"" characters. I thought the author did a great job intertwining the relationships of all of these people. I highly recomend this book."
4,Well worth it,"My friend recommended this book, and it was well worth reading it. I always check other reviews before starting a new book, and this time I was afraid I would not like reading this book. I am glad I was wrong.Mother of Pearl has many characters, including Valuable Korner, daughter of the town's whore. It was set in a small town in Mississippi in the late 1950s.Melinda Haynes has a unique way of telling the story. It is not an easy reading, by the way. You just can't skip a word she wrote. This was her first novel, and she did a great job. She used her own Southern roots and language to describe the characters and the events.I recommend this book, but it is not one of those novels you just cannot put down, no matter what. It can get boring sometimes, but in the very next chapter you are hooked again. I really enjoyed reading it, and I plan on reading it again someday."
2,"Good characters undermined by weak ""sacrificial lamb"" plot","A real crash-and-burn novel, the characters are great but the structure is loose. Just as I wondered why Nicolas Sparks ended Message in a Bottle on such a tragic note, I find myself asking Hayne the same question. I see her attempt at restoring those with tragic pasts, but the way in which she accomplishes this just could not happen in 1956. My willing suspension of disbelief could not sustain itself in the final chapters. She covered her tracks to make the loose ends tie together, but the characters were watered-down by then. Incorrect and vague references: ""dentil"" when referring to an architectural decoration is incorrectly spelled ""dental."" At the end, I had to read a paragraph three times to understand what ""her"" means because of an improper antecedant. Once again, I love her characters."
1,Don't bother reading this book.....,"I really had a hard time reading this book...it was extremely pondorous, and pointless for so long, it was a real struggle to finish it. If I hadn't bought it in hardback, it would be fireplace fodder by now. This is the second Oprah book I have read -- and I really disliked the first one -- and swore I would not read another one. Well, I am renewing that vow --NEVER AGAIN! I think Ms. Winfrey has an extremely odd taste in books. If she wants people to read more, she should stop recommending these types of books!!!"
1,BOOOOOORING!,"I never leave a book unfinished, but I finally threw this one down in disgust the other day. It's going in the Goodwill bag with my bookmark still in it around page 100. I tried but I just can't like this writing. Wish I'd read the reviews before I wasted my money."
2,Mother of Pearl,"I tried to read this book. I've read other Oprah books and loved them. I felt this book was not worth my time. I put the book down and would try over again, but couldn't finish it. I stopped half through. There was no plot and it moved very slow. The characters didn't impress me. I felt it was a waste of my time."
1,"Boring, Boring, Boring","I've liked all the other Oprah picks, but this one was the pits. Nothing of interest happened, the characters were unappealing and I gave up on page 200."
2,"Love Oprah picks, but lost on this one","Im sorry, but I usually love Oprah picks, but I have given up chasing the characters and figuring out who is who. Im on to the next pick. I am dissapointed. I usually am very excited about a new books out with Oprah's approval. Go on to Tara's Road. I loved that one."
2,Rambling. Too many characters to follow! Disjointed.,"Oprah never selects books that flow easily and have less drama. Life is difficult, why do we have to read about it! The south needs a break! The author had to take it to the 50's since I felt she was living under a rock otherwise! Move on! Let's see some growth. A friend gave me the book on loan. I was glad I did not buy it! The author needs work! Very cumbersome. Had to keep a notepad handy to record all the characters.I was lost from chapter to chapter. All I can say, I am glad it is over. Not a book for entertainment. Too much work for this reader."
2,Alot of obscence language and hard to read,"Slow at first, hard to follow along. Surprise ending. Alot of swearing through out this book. Sometimes unsure of who the character is. Hard time following along with the plot."
3,My First Oprah Book,"This was not an easy read! It took me 5-6 weeks to complete, but was glad I did. I enjoyed the characters. They were realistic, albeit a little strange (a condition which is not uncommon in real people). Several of them were shallow and weak, the majority were well developed with original voices.The complexity and intricacy of the various story lines was challenging and is what made the book interesting.On the down side, parts of the book were long and tedious. Too much time was spent on Jolebs rescue and recovery, as well as, the flood. Did anyone get the symbolism of the slit pig, Did I miss something or did Ms.Haynes fail to provide an explanation or reason?All in all, I did like the book. Ms Haynes did a good job projecting her view of race, culture and relationships in Mississippi during a very turbulent time."
3,"Good story, if you can find it","Haynes characters are certainly interesting and very appealing, and the story is good..BUT,the writing is so ""wordy"". Almost painful digging through it to get to the story. I can feel the labor of love she put into writing this book. I went through my own sort of labor reading it."
1,This author needs to learn how to construct sentences!,"This has certainly been a unique read. I do not know where this author was educated but the writing is very poor. The story, which is one of hope and redempton, can at times hold thereader's interest, however, each sentence is a chore to get through. Not worth the struggle!"
1,Leave it alone,These Oprah books are getting worse with each successive selection. This one is offensively sub-par.
4,Very well written,"Melinda Haynes has produced a very good novel, rich in characterization and flavor. I have to say, however, that Oprah needs to widen her horizons a little and refrain at least once in awhile from touting the same kind of fiction. Earth to Oprah! There are many, many fine books out there that deserve some attention, even though they don't fit into your narrow tastes in literature. ""The Triumph and the Glory"" comes to mind, as does ""After Dunkirk"", and ""The Last Day"". I was intrigued by ""Mother of Pearl"" despite my frustration with Oprah, INC. Keep up the great writing, Melinda!"
4,A Great Book!,"This was a very good book, long but good. All the characters were intertwined one way or another but you didn't know it til the moment it was revealed. Even Grace and Valuable stood their ground as equal characters in the book. Little did they know how small the world around them was until their pasts crossed and shaped their lives in the present. I really enjoyed the author's writing style.Reviewed by: Sheila"
2,PLOTLESS WONDER,"Reading this book seemed an excercize in futility. Although most of the Oprah books I've read have been decent this one seems to have no plot or purpose. I do believe the author has the potential to tell a good story if she would just find an interesting tale to tell. The characters in this book were sporadic and underdeveloped. Most of the time I had no clue as to what was going on, and I consider myself an avid reader. Maybe it's just me, but this book just didn't deliver. I wish her better luck on the next novel because I do believe she is a capable writer if only she could find the right story to tell."
1,The Reader's Guide to Poor Writing...,"The reviewer who used the word ""pretentious"" summed this one up. This book is nothing if not a long, boring, poorly edited anecdote. We have here an unrealistic portrayal of the South, circa 1956 Mississippi. No characters are fully realized, and cheap symbolism is casually thrown about with little apparent link to anything. The repetition of the phrase ""You say that true."", and the broad use of the term ""hasn't got a clue"" (remember, this is 1956 Mississippi) cause the reader to wonder what Martha Levin (the editor)does for a living. Author Haynes needs to pick up a copy of Strunk and White's ""Elements of Style"" (available here at Amazon) and get this clue: OMIT NEEDLESS WORDS. How I trudged through the pages of this book and completed it is beyond my understanding. Perhaps I could not believe that these words were actually published."
2,I am totally confused,"I bought ""Mother of Pearl"" a couple of weeks ago, but only got around to starting it a few days ago. I normally like the books that Oprah chooses for her book club, so I was excited about this one. Well...I just couldn't get into it. I found it extremely confusing, I did not like the writing style. I kept reading, just to see if it would get any better, but it never did grip me. So I finally decided to give up on it, about 1/3 way through. I can only remember doing that with 2 other books."
1,don't bother,"I am an Oprah book club aficionado. Love most of them, but once in a while she picks a clunker. This is one of them. I couldn't get into it, didn't enjoy the characters, nothing happened, and it was still confusing. I don't understand how it got such good reviews in the trades. It is impossible to wade through and, ultimately, not worth the effort. IMHO."
1,"The book was cumbersome, unrealistic, and full of loose ends","I love to read but this one is going to make me take a break for a while. The characters names were very confusing...Even and Valuable...even Joleb. (how do you like that me using even as a proper noun and adjective in the same sentence) Not until the end of the book did I know whether to pronounce the ""e"" long or short in Joleb name. At any rate, please give us something where we don't have to work so hard for our entertainment next time."
2,hard to follow.,"Although it did not take me as long to read as some of the other readers, I often thought "" Is this the same book that I started?"" I love stories about the South, but this one was not one that I would recommend. My own book club has chosen it for our next discussion. I don't think it will be a very long one."
2,WHAT WAS ALL OF THE FUSS ABOUT?,"When I first read some of the bad reviews, I wouldn't let myself believe the book could be so bad, especially since I have enjoyed most of the books from Oprah's club. Please ignore the hype, the book is as bad as others have alluded to. The ony reason I finished the book is because its my personal policy, I had to see at what point would it start to make sense. I'm still waiting."
2,"An interesting, though disjointed read!","The book was slow moving and somewhat confusing. I had to reread several pages for clarification. The pages overflowed with strange, but interesting characters and their connections were not always clear.Was there symbolism in the dream about a walking, talking, slit pig? That still has me baffled. The end was a shocker, I would never have guessed it.All in all, the book was ok. Ms. Haynes did a good job blending the different southern cultures. A good book of 400 pages usually takes me one week, this one took over a month. This was my first read along with Oprah, I was determined to complete it!"
2,This was long winded and dissappointing,"I was very dissappointed in oprah this time. Usually her picks are great.This one was long winded, and difficult to follow.At times I skipped several pages as nothing was happening.The book vclearly did not hold my interest."
1,Not so hot for a summer book.,"I got 200 pages into this book and donated it to theL.A. County Library. Maybe someone else can finish it. I tried. Ireally did. But I have to say . . re: the Oprah books, I am still reeling from White Oleander. And living in the L.A. area, I am noticing, maybe for the first time, how we are swimming in Oleander bushes/trees (of all colors) and it is a beautiful sight right now."
1,Don't waste your time or your money on this book.,"I will tell anyone that will listen not to buy this book! Further, I would suggest not to waste time reading this book when there are so many others that are more worthy of the time it takes to read a novel. The characters never fully ""evolve"" and, I found myself wondering the whole time how they would all eventually tie together. The book starts flat and ends the same way. In my opinion, the most amusing character (very small part) was the goat!"
1,If I hadn't been stuck on a plane I wouldn't have read it.,"The characters were unreal and the details were untrue. Where on earth did Two Sun live before she dropped into this book? About the time I started liking Joleb, he ends up in the quarters turning on a faucet. I grew up in Mississippi, and if there was a faucet it didn't work after a flood. Research was lacking throughout."
1,Too many characters with trite names.,"Oh Oprah - where did you find this one? I am glad I borrowed this one from my public library - I would have lamented the waste of cash had I purchased it. Is Melinda a southerner? Did she live in the 50's? Where did she get such affected names for her characters -Valuable and Even? Toni Morrison (known for her ""naming"" of characters) she's not."
5,Poetic,"I adored the prose-like writing of this book. It was beautifully descriptive. The tea-colored water, the old worn sign whose purpose had been forgotten...all these wonderful details really set the scene for this story. It's almost like painting with words. Of course, the characters were glorious. I especially liked Joleb, whose bluntly spoken words had me laughing out loud."
1,Wasted time and cash!,"It sounds like it would be a good book, and might actually have been, if the author had stuck to any of the dozen or so storylines she started. Interesting ideas wither on the vine as Hayes jumps to something/someone new or more convinient in order to somehow justify one of the most insultingly implausible endings I've come across in quite a while. A total disappointment."
2,mother of pearl,although I never want to put any writters work down I just couldnt give this book a good review its to wordy the writer of this book describes this way to much and not enough action I wanted to read this book because Oprah gave it such a good review on her show but i just couldnt get into it
2,Disappointing at best,"I really wanted to like this book. When I first started reading, I was quickly drawn to the main character,Valuable. Other characters (Even, Joody) were interesting as well. But, I eventually found the author's prose overbearing to the point of exaustion. The basic story line was a great idea; I just feel as though the book would have been much better had it not been so frothy. I kept finding myself needing to put the book down because I couldn't stomach anymore fluff. In fact, had I not cared for Valuable's character as much as I did, I'd have quit reading this book altogether, without a second thought."
3,Strange,"This book was very different from all the other books I have read before. It told a couple stories at once and it got very confusing to follow at first but then once i got used to reading it, it was a good book. I liked the way the characters were all linked in the end and how they learned to get along.The way the girl has to teach her self everything and has to learn the hardway about everything was very humbling to read. Then getting pregnant in the middle of the book and not knowing it and everyone else knowing it and not telling you till it's to late was very sad.All in all it was a good book. I never really liked to read long books but this one kept my attention."
1,This book was an incredible disappointment,"As an avid reader and a fan of most of Oprah's Book Club selections, I have to admit that I was truly disappointed by Mother of Pearl. The characters really lacked definition and despite the various stages of turmoil each was facing in their lives, I didn't care about any of them or what happened to them. The story lines for each character seemed to go no where -- very slowly. Since the book was so long and drawn out and I didn't much care about any of the characters, I actually stopped reading the book with only about 100 pages left. I have never, ever not finished a book before, no matter how bad -- so that should give you an idea of how awful this one was. If you're looking for a good book along the lines of Oprah's usual picks, try Home is Where the Heart is by Billy Letts, Here on Earth by Alice Hoffman or Black and Blue by Anna Quindlen."
1,"Bored, cliched, I hated it","I'll be honest, I didn't finish this book. But that's because I was bored by the first page. Having grown up in the south, this was so full of tired cliches I could barely concentrate on the story. Beyond that, call me a prude, but there was way to much gratuitous discussion of nudity (especially in children) to the point that it was distracting and utterly pointless to the plot. The woman by the river was a ridiculous caricature... I mean, I just couldn't take that seriously. And it was depressing. If I want to be depressed, I'd prefer it not be in my free time reading made up stories. Ok, I could go on, but you get the point. So, yes, I hated it."
2,Feel like I wasted my time.,I should have given up on this book early on but I stubbornly stuck with it. The story did get a little better...but I still feel as though I wasted my time.
1,The worst oprah book club selection ever...,"I read over 150 pages of this book and it was a struggle all the way. I was thoroughly disappointed with this selection. Impossible to make sense of the characters, the story was boring...and I never finished it.. I figure that reading is suppose to be a pleasurable experience. As I look at the other reviews I can see I am not alone."
1,The story line was heading somewhere but.......,"I really tried to like this book. It started off as an intersting story although it was very wordy and hard to follow. The number one problem with this book is that the author leads you to think you are heading to a climax but then bypasses the climax in just about every instance,leaving the reader to find out what happens through the conversations of the other characters. There are too many characters without any character development I saw many influences of other novels such as Flowers in the Attic and Boys Life, but without the story telling ability of those respective authors. This book made me feel like I wasted my time."
1,Wish I could pick ZERO stars....,"This was the worst Oprah book that I have read! I don't get all the people who gave the book such high marks and were so entranced by it. I am an avid reader, and I always finish any book that I buy, but this book really tested my resolve. I wanted to throw the book in the trash every other chapter. The characters were just okay, and the ""lyrical prose"" was tedious and boring. I would never recommend this book to anyone, and I am in complete disbelief that it will be made into a movie. But then again, a screenplay that generously cuts out the wordy nonsense could be a big improvement on the novel. My advice...Wait For The Movie."
1,Mother of Pearl,AAURRGHH! Will this TEDIOUS story ever end! I have put this book down twice vowing never to pick it up again - and I rarely give up on a book... The author uses far too many rambling metaphors. The story gets completely lost in non-essential information.
2,A summer wasted!,I thought that there was something wrong with me that I did not enjoy this book untill I saw some of the other reviews. In the end it seemed that even the author just wanted to get it over with too. I might recomend this book to someone in solitary confinement with a lot of time to spend on this book. It was very confusing and long. I am just happy that it is over
2,A chore to read,This was a difficult and sometimes confusing book to read. Nothing really grabbed me and made me want to keep reading. I forced myself to finish the book and was surprised when I discovered the story was better than I thought it would be. I'm not sure I would recommend it to others.
2,"Oprah's usual historical race pick, dark and uninspiring","To be honest, after reading the first 100 pages I skimmed through the rest to get a feel of the story. Sometimes I wonder why Oprah picks (and recommends) these dark novels, that leave you more depressed then thoughtful. I really wouldn't recommend the book to many, unless depressing story lines really enthrall them."
2,Don't waste your time...,Don't waste your time. The story is slow in starting and riddled with trite character names and a wandering story line. It starts to go interesting places then turns around and heads in another direction. The author should thank Oprah. It's the only way anyone would ever bother to read it.
2,Mother of Pearl wasn't worth the $11.98 I paid.,"Mother of Pearl was a story set in the south, but were exactlydid some of the language come from? At times it was hard to figureout exactly who was doing the talking. Many times I grew confused and would have to reread pages. Don't get me wrong Melinda Haynes did a wonderful job with her descriptions of Petal and Hattisburg and Grand Bay. I felt as if I closed my eyes I could see everything. In the future I hope that she can bring the story together a little sooner than in this book. Tell Oprah I hope she does better with the next pick."
1,Now I know why I don't like fiction.,"This was my first attempt at reading a Oprah book club selection...I thought I was going to go somewhere in this book but it only made me go around in circles...I wouldn't of purchased it in the first place if I had noticed that the brother was name ""Even"" cause a brother will never ""break even"" in a book with a white girl named, what else...""Valuable""...come on...its time for Black folks to tell our own ""fiction"" in creatively plain words that we can comprehend, understand and really ""feel our spirit"" ...now I know why Oprah is so rich...girlfriend is getting PAID to promote this pseudo-intellectual nonsense."
1,Waste of Time and Money!,"I have read many of Oprah's book club selections. I loved some, and tollerated others. But The Mother of Pearl is unbearable! The language is difficult, and insulting! The characters you should love, you can't understand. The story line shiftes too frequently to comprehend. AND WHAT IS IT ABOUT THE PIGS?"
3,great characters,"I knew this book wasnt going to be easy after I read the first chapter but I stuck with it because frankly I dont give up easily. However, after a while I started to enjoy this book. The characters were interesting and the story drew me in. I was reading passionately when the book lost steam. After joleb was found, chapters just went on and on about the river. I give the book 3 stars because there was a lot in this book that enjoyed but I think the book needed an editor to cut a lot of lulls."
1,Couldn't even get through the first 20 pages,I usally enjoy all of Oprahs choices but this one is very disappointing. I didn't even finish the book.
1,I hope you have a lot of time for this one,It will take you forever to get through this novel.Getting through the first 300 pages is like trying to walk through quicksand. The final 100 pages has a riveting storyline. But why did it take the author so long to get everything to come together?
2,Pretty disappointing. Falls apart quickly.,"I love to read and this book started out with high hopes and fascinating characters. So promising! And Oprah said, ""Stay with it until after the flood!"" so as I was enjoying the book up to the flood, I thought ""Wow--if this is the low part of the book, I am really going to enjoy it!"" But then the story just fell apart. The characters never developed and seemed to just be filling the remainder of the pages with ramblings; their personalities drifting into nothingness. I usually will re-read a book a few months later--this one I have already given away."
1,Ugh! Just not worth it.,"This book was to say the least, a big challenge to read. I read it, and reread it. I have read most of Oprah's picks, but this one I would have opted not to buy, had I known the confusion it would cause in my mind. (A lot of back tracking was done and that didn't seem to help! Anyone out there understand the pig?) This book is one that will retire at a used book store somewhere. I would not recommend it unless you have a lot of time to study and attempt to figure the sorted mess out. Even watching the Oprah show on the book club discussion did not help me to understand. Get past the flood, Oprah said, and then it is smooth sailing and things will come into place. Not for this reader! I just am amazed that it was published."
2,Very hard to follow,"The language in this book is very hard to wade through and the story seems to skip around quite a bit. Overall, it's a confusing read. I have read several books in the Oprah book club, but this by far is the hardest one to get through. If you like complex, winding stories, this might be the book for you. On the other hand, if you like quick, light reads that don't require much thought, skip ahead or better yet, you might just want to skip the Oprah books altogether!"
1,Horrible read,"I did something I NEVER do when reading a book. I PUT IT DOWN, and I refused to finish it. It was a tedious story with far too many characters that the author could not sucessfully tie togerther. Not only did I find the writing to be unbearable, it was also full of the worst kind of human suffering. I gave it one star because I had to give it something, and after reading a few of Oprah's picks I have come to the conclusion that they are all the same. They are stories of horrible human suffering, unrealistic circumstances, and just plain horrible reads. I enjoy a good read as much as any avid reader but I cannot comprehend what pleasure anyone could find in this book. So I guess I will chalk this purchase up to poor judgment and toss it in the trash. Sorry, I won't be reading any works by Ms. Haynes and no more Oprah picks for me."
2,EXHAUSTING!,"While this book had its lyrical moments, it was an extremely trying read. I can say that it is just good enough to want to finish but there are entire chapters that I hummed through; not necessarily remembering what I had read. In other words, I just desperately wanted to finish and move on to a better novel. I'm not sure that Haynes did the best job at developing some of her characters (such as Canaan and Jackson). It seems there are a lot of unanswered questions about each one concerning what makes them tick.I think the author has talent, but am hoping for a more brilliant attempt next time."
4,Excellent.,"The lives of the characters are told with all the realness, the passions, the violence and the bigotry that we've grown up with in the South. Amidst all the action (yes, action ...) is a great story about rising above circumstances and making peace with all the demons."
4,"A gripping, intense and moving piece of literature!","This book was one of the best pieces of fiction I've read in a long time. But as others have stated, Ms. Haynes style of writing is very wordy. I found myself having to reread certain passages two or three times. At the time I almost resented having to do so but after finishing the book I realize that this also contributed to ""the story."" I feel that I now know these characters personally. I can hardly wait for the movie! Being a white woman born immediately after this time period gave me an advantage in being able to get to know these complex characters of Ms. Haynes. Also, being form the South , I found myslelf being able to associate people from my small town childhood with Val, Cannan, Joleb and especially Evan. Keep writing Ms. Haynes. I am encouraging my 21 year old daughter to read this book. She is an avid reader and I am very curious to hear her thoughts on the book. Again, the movie cannot come to us soon enough."
2,"Good, but very complicated","It was a good story with a good plot and I enjoyed how it all binded together at the end, but it was very hard to understand and I found myself reading lines over and over to make since of it."
1,A waste of pleasure reading time! The worst!,"Oprah's choice here of ""Mother of Pearl"" almost puts me back to not wanting to follow her recommendations. The character's name Even throws the reader off when the author uses the word as a proper noun and an adjective in the same paragraph. The story tended to be choppy, discontected and often times confusing. And the story itself is begining to get long in the tooth. Sorry, but there are better summer readings out there to enjoy rather than suffer through this one."
1,Tedious and wordy with a rehashed plot,"Every word read like razors slicing through my skin. I enjoy Southern fiction, but the plot is old and the author's voice didn't bring anything fresh to the story. I'm wondering how this even made it to a publisher's desk..."
2,Difficult read,This felt like a reading assignment for a college literature class. It wasn't a book that felt like a pleasure to read. I had to force myself to finish it. A lot of Oprah's Book Club selections are like that.
1,Very difficult to read.,"I am still on page 51, have been on page 51 for 2 weeks now. Very difficult to get into, confusing and complicated. Does not hold interest at all! How did this book become Oprah's book club??"
2,Needs a little more polish or a lot less editing,"Usually I can whip through an average size novel in two or three days. I found that I had to keep back tracking to find a connection between one thing and another and there were few connections. Call me stupid, but I think that there was too much missing or pulled out of the book to make us what; think? reflect? fill-in-the-blank?I'm not sorry I read it, I'm just sorry I had such high expectations."
2,A Very Slow Read,"I usually enjoy Oprah's picks, but I am having trouble staying with this one. I finally reached page 150--but I find myself backtracking quite a bit. I usually finish each book I start and I'll try to finish this one also. I just hope that things pick up."
2,a mishmash of themes with no central purpose.,"Because it was an oprah selection I looked forward to reading it. Even when I'd gotten through 2/3 of the book I didn't give up because I was sure it would make sense eventually. well it didn't. I understand the concept of people of different colors becoming caring of one another and I have no argument with that. It could have been done in a way that would have been meaningful instead of confusing and at times a mishmash of ideas, themes, circumstances, as though the author recalled every event she could conjur up and put them together in the pages of one book. The matter of the pigs was completely beyond my comphrehension and I believe anybody else's who read it.Come on Oprah, give us something better next time."
4,challenged anyone,I enjoyed reading this book even tho I had to back track a chapter or two. I felt like I had really finished a complete novel when I had finished.
3,Not what it's cracked up to be!,"This story centers around two people: Even Grade and Valuable Korner. Even is an orphan. Valuable is the daughter of the town whore and an unknown father trying to find herself. Along this journey, she falls in love with a young man named Jackson who is acually a close relative of hers although neither of them are aware of it. Even is a working man who has made a life for himself in Mississippi with his good friend, Canaan, and flaky girlfriend, Joody, who is a fortune-teller. When Even and Valuable's paths cross about two-thirds into the book, they find something of themselves in the other and the story really begins to pick up and get interesting. Until then, however, it takes a lot of perseverance to keep reading. It took me about two months to read this book which is uncharacteristically long for me. The storyline is powerful, but the writing is atrocious. It's hard to get past bad writing sometimes and this was one of those cases for me."
1,"Worst book I've ever, ever read","I bought this book on vacation and was on the beach in a secluded area unable to conveniently get to another bookstore - I would otherwise have tossed it early on. But, in view of my situation, I muddled through it and can honestly say I just hated this book. I just can't find words to describe how much I disliked the characters, the writing, the language, the ridiculous story line. I still shudder over this book!And, really, was there Oil of Olay in the 50's? I didn't think so."
3,Mother of Pearl,"I found this book to be just OK. I was trying to find the right words to use to describe what I felt while reading this book. The term that finally came to mind was ""CUMBERSOME"". For most of the book I couldn't keep track of what was going on. I still can't even tell you what the point to this story was. I think that there were just too many characters focused on in this book - each character seemed to have a full life story given and quite a few of them had NOTHING to do with the main character or her story. These extra characters made the read rather confusing. After getting better than 3/4 of the way through the book, I found myself skipping to the end to just get it over with already."
4,Hard on the eyes? Try your ears instead!,"The mannerism of Nana Visitor's reading style on the audio version of this book literally breathes life into these wonderfully, diverse characters. Her intelligent technique of knowing when to ebb and when to flow, and her flawless presentation of each character's personality and ""voice"", gives well-earned justice to Ms. Haynes unique writing style.Admittedly, even on audio, there were parts of the first chapter that were so full of metaphor and prose that it took a while to find the rythmic niche... but only momentarily. The story was so intriguing, and Nana so adept in her presentation, that I began to marvel not only at its unfolding tale, but at the way it was read. The story of the relationships between these wonderful, interesting characters... full of diversity, twists, and insight, is one I'll not soon forget."
1,Tedious,Terribly written--it reads like a soap opera. I would never have finished it if it weren't an assignment for a book club. It was pure tedium to get through it and reads like it's written by a high-school kid. I didn't care about any of the characters and could hardly remember who they were.
1,Surrealism gone wrong,"This book is full of prtences.A group of poor uneducated rural folk in Mississippi carrying on like at a cocktail party at the Museum of Modern Art.Simple black people quoting from Greek tragedies.Unfathomable prose with no respite.The author has an obsession with bodily fluids and every imaginable effuents.Four letter words galore.Stereotyping based on color,profession and religion.To focus on the deep south, the author casually mentions lynchings,Klan and not being served soon at a paint store et al.Impossible situations,meaningless theories,irrelevant characters and pretend pop psychology. Perhaps the author wanted to do a Salvador Dali in a novel form.But it is gone wrong.Perhaps she should return to her vocationand resume painting.But I have lost faith in book clubs and best seller lists."
2,Memorex MP3124 Boombox experience not the best,"I have a library of 35 MP3 discs. 20 worked fine right off the bat. Got 8 more to work after burning over 60 CDs trying to figure out what was wrong.Memorex support is NON-EXISTENT. Sent detailed email to their support group and never heard back.Still can't get 7 mp3 CDs to work....ready to give up guessing.These 7 work fine on portable mp3 player and DVD/mp3 and computer.The ones that work come up in about 12 seconds ready to play.Works with 128, 160, 256 kbsProblems:- Will not read CD...spins forever until you stop it- 60 to 120 seconds before ready to play- Lists wrong number of folders- List total files greater than actual files, repeats earlier songs 1 or more times later in playback list.Some fixes were:- only 23 or less files per folder (fixes total file read problem)- possible limit on number of folders- Can't handle long file names (unsure of actual limit)Any suggestions please email me at: cranekenup@attbi.com"
1,Not even worth the time it took to return,"I bought this particular item for it's capability to play MP3 discs, it being the first box I have found in a store with that capability. Boy, what a disappointment.The first box I bought home would play about 10 songs on a home recorded MP3 CD-R (ironically enough, a memorex cd-r) then it would stop tracking altogether. When the box was shut off and examined, I found that the CD was actually hot enough to be painful to touch from being played. This is not right.I returned the item, and exchanged it for a new one. This one would not even recognize that a CD had been placed in the player, and would constantly demand that the door be shut. Enough is enough, I'm buying another brand in the future, and recommend that others do so as well."
3,"Just what I needed, but...","This is the perfect ""boom box"" for playing CDs, Tapes, Radio and MP3s. At the clearance price..., how could I pass it up??? The only thing that keeps this from getting a 5 star rating is that when playing MP3s, the unit tends to overheat to the point that the laser mistracks. Excessive use (i.e. continuous play for more than 3-4 hours) will cause the unit ""sensory overload"" and the MP3 CD will begin to skip. I've had no problems with normal CDs or tapes. Overall this is a good buy. I'm just glad I didn't spend the... list [price]."
3,Not a buy,"The first player I had to return to Target. It would not recognize any CDs. The second player worked. However, it will not recognize all MP3 CDs, but it is better than my home unit (Samsung). The display light burned out after a while, I thought. It came back a few days again, but would not stay on. The direct track feature is cumbersome. The player does not load fast. It took me almost 5 minutes to load one MP3 CD. At least it recognized it. Overall, a C+ until something better comes along."
2,"The Features I wanted, But failed to deliver.","I picked up one of these at a local Good Guys. Within a couple of months the CD (and thus MP3) stopped working. As a cassette player it has eaten multiple tapes (mostly books on tape which always sucks to loose one of a multiple tape set). The radio works fine, but 1 out of 4 functions doesn't even start to redeem this unit. I hope other manufactures take note, because IF the unit worked as it was designed, it would be the perfect small portable stereo. I spotted Amazon carrying this while shopping for it's replacement. I still haven't found one that fits the bill, but if you are looking for something like this, I'd try another brand first."
1,Consider something else,"I purchased this unit in Dec. 2001 for it's ability to play MP3 files. Which it did for about 3 months and then it began playing 5 or 6 selections and quit. It does the same thing on regular CD's as well. I sent numerous emails and also a regular USPS letter. I have not had the courtesy of a response to date (11/10/02). Based on Memorex's lack of response I will never purchase another Memorex product again. By the way, if I could rate this product with zero or negative stars I would. If you cannot tell it by now, Memorex makes my blood boil."
1,mp3 boombox - not this one!,"Has only played from an mp3 style disc once, and after 4 months of ownership it does not even play audio cds anymore. I wish I kept my receipt. I wish I read reviews first."
3,Now I agree,"I was optimistic when I bought this, thinking, oh we'll enjoy it. Nope, he just plays with the tractors. The board is boring and the game itself seems never ending. After a couple of rounds on differnt days, I gave in and just let him use the tractors and Frank."
2,Not destined to become a classic board game,"My six-year-old saved his money and spent it on this game. The movie tie-in lured him to the purchase. We've played the game a few times. I'm still not completely clear on the rules. The ""points"" assigned to the tractors are impossible to read - in fact my son, who wears eyeglasses, cannot even tell where they are. He prefers the old classics, Monopoly Jr., Sorry, Trouble, Mousetrap, and Scrabble Jr. to this game. Purchase one of those instead."
3,SMALL PIECES!!,"The first thing we observed with this toy was how small the pieces were. Given that the target audience is the 3-6 year old crowd, I'm surprised that the pieces were so small. But my 4 year old really likes the game - not really for the gameplay, but rather just to move the pieces around. I think they could've just made some die-cast figurines and they'd have had just as much fun. Overall, not a great item, but they really love these Cars games!!"
4,Fun but simple,"This game is fun for the family. It's very simple and can be played by young children learning to count. It's not overly exciting by itself, but you can make it that way with your own spin on sound effects."
2,It's ok,"There are lots of little pieces, and the rules are a bit complex. I played it with my nephews ages 7 and 5 and they both had a hard time staying interested for the length of the game. However they have both asked to play it since, so they must like something about it :)"
4,Check This Out,"This is a pretty good CD. Petro-Loukas is one of the best Epirus artists today. Though this is a good source of Epirus music, there are definately better out there. The best part of this CD is track #6 ""Smandakas"". This song is a great song to dance to and makes the whole CD worth buying."
3,The Dancing Machine,"The musicians need to let loose, too anesthetic. Too clean for my taste, I personally like the ""live"" flavor of Epirus music. Petro-Loukas is one of the top five clarinet players in Epirus.There is definately better Epirus music out there with more of a ""folky"" feel."
3,"eh, it was ok","i LOVED Seventh Son. I LOVED Red Prophet. Prentice Alvin was a MAJOR disappointemnt, and this one, well, Alvin Journeyman is only slightly better than its predecessor. But still, even though these books are going downhill, i can't help myself, I HAVE to know what happens to alvin and the crystal city! i rank this book 3 stars not because it's so terrible, but because it doesn't rank among the 5 stars i'm used to getting from OSC. Hart's Hope was EXCELLENT, and so was Ender's Game. THat's the kind of quality i love. But i digress. Nevertheless, the Alvin Maker series is intriguing, despite the occasional bad plot twist and whatnot. hopefully Heartfire is better. right now i'm feeling like there's not enough character development to support the amount of characters OSC has introduced in Alvin Journeyman."
3,Alvin Maker is degenerating into a weekly TV show,"I've given up all hope of resolution. The epic story of Alvin Maker has become a series of side adventures that, while still entertaining, are rapidly losing their momentum."
4,Leaves you wanting more,"The book was well written and keeps with the flow of the other three, but there are a number of characters that have been dropped. I read the book within a week and enjoyed the new plot twists, but I am wondering if Card can finish this series in 5. It would be quite a task, and I hope he ties everything up better than this book would leave you to believe he can. I recommend this book for those that have loved the previous titles, and hope you don't come to the same conclusions I have"
5,Excellent but too many years between sequels!,"This series will be a joy to someone starting to read it 15-20 years from now.This is an excellent continuation of the Alvin Maker series - a truly fantastic fantasy/historical series of books. If history books had read anywhere near this I may have actually learned something in those classes instead of somehow getting A's while learning nothing long-term!!Please be aware that this is NOT the last book in this series - like some previously ticked off reviewer thought.The series published:1st in '87 2nd in '88 (not bad!) 3rd in '89 (kinda bad) 4th in '95 (Yikes! Why so long!) 5th one forthcoming in '98...There's probably at least a 6th coming, maybe a seventh. Can Card finish this series before he dies? Well, let's hope for no more pauses like the one before this one was published..."
2,THIS is supposed to be the ending?!?!,"I loved the first three books in this series, but, how can I put this nicely? This one stinks. This series built up alot of momentum, and I don't mind when the author leaves something to the imagination. But I DO mind when the author leaves the entire ending to the imagination! It was well written, but that's besides the point. Things they talk about through all the books are never resolved. I don't think there's any excuse for this book, except maybe he was having an off day, or a few chapters were lost."
3,Maintaining the decline,"The positive: Affable characters, fast moving, easy to read.The negative: Uninteresting plot.Although slightly better than the previous book in this series, Card still doesn't manage to recreate the magic of the first two. In this book, the bulk of the tale is involved in Alvin facing trial for being wrongly accused of theft. Many characters are introduced based on characters created in an AOL chatroom by Card's fans and this book gives the impression much of it was written to coddle those fans and feature their characters. Not an entire waste of time but don't go into this series thinking each of the books will be as entertaining as the others."
4,Just tell me what happened!,"I've just finished reading this book. It took me only 2 nights to finish it, not because it was so good (like the first book of this series, along with many of Card's books), but because of my frustration. I had to endure several pages in order to know what happened next. How long do I have to wait until Alvin gets to the Crystal City? I remember that I had exactly the same feeling when I was reading ""Children of the Mind"". Still, I had my reward of joy when I finished the finale of Ender's saga. So I guess I have to keep reading the Alvin series until the end."
2,Ummm...not his best work,"Well, I loved Ender Game, in fact I've just read it again for the umpteenth time, but even ignoring what this wirter is actually capable of, this is not a good book. The problem is, and it's true of the rest of this series and of the Wiggin books subsequent to Ender's Game, is that the main character is just boring. I found that the 'goodies' were just sooo good and the 'bad guys' just so bad that I really had no sympathy for any of them. In fact, by the time I had read about two thirds of my way through I only kept reading out of a sense of obligation, not because there was any real interest in seeing it through. The only thing I really enjoyed was speculating about whether there were really homosexual overtones in the feelings of the lawyer (I can't even remember his name) toward Alvin. If you're determined to read Card, read Ender's Game or The Lost Boys (a short story that he published in one of his collections and is brilliant) instead"
3,Not the miracle worker I was hoping for.,"My husband suffers when we go on long trips where his buns get numb. I was hoping this would work and it did not. It noticed no difference. the product, itself, is nice, little more flimsy than I would like, but okay. since it didn't work, we have removed it. we are now looking for another miracle cure"
2,Its too flimsy,"The wooden beads are comfortable and role with your movement. But they are keep together with a thin polyethylene ""wire"" which breaks and beads go flying everywhere. One size does not fit all, least of all, a small car. And you have to find some away to keep it from slipping down; the attached elastic is not very good."
3,"Not ready for use ""out-of-the-box""","Plan on adding your own 550lb. Type III Paracord or some other means to secure this thing to your seat, the goofy little straps/strings it comes with are a total joke."
3,Making-Do,"I read all the other reviews- and they are all pretty dead on. This is the first beaded cover Ive owned and I do like it- BUT it is WAAAY to small. I drive a tiny car (hyundai accent) and the seat cover just does not fit. Please dont be fooled by the product image- the perspective is way off. The narrow part is much longer than it appears- and one of the pictures submitted by 'reviewers' has got to be on a fake car seat. There is no way this product would cover a seat as shown. I put up some pictures of it in my car for comparison. Also the tie downs are flimsy (like everyone warned) and Im just merely making-do with it for now.That said, it is better than nothing and seems to be pretty durable, given that it has been hanging from my headrest for a month- and let's face it- the price is good- especially with free shipping..."
2,Bled brown stains all over my leather seat,"I was trying to install it on a hot summer day, so I just laid it out on the seat (very warm inside of car). I came back a few minutes later and picked it up to find little brown dots all over the seat. I decided to return it."
3,worked as described,"Personally I've always been more of a fan of the coiled spring type of ventilated seat cushions, but the bucket seats in my car don't work with them.this works well enough to add some airflow to my back, particularly when sitting on black leather seats in the summer, in a convertible. Any airflow is good!"
3,Pros and Cons,"If you're deciding whether to buy this, then this review might not help. That's because I'm really conflicted over whether I like it or not. So it's A LOT bigger than the picture makes it seem, which is a good thing, and it fits comfortably in my bucket seat. It stays on fine too, and I'm not sure why other reviewers had such trouble with this. But it makes me look like an old man taxi cab driver, and I think the wooden beads smell a little funky. I bought it to keep my back cool this summer, and for that, it's been working just fine."
2,Not quite what I expected,"I owned a beaded seat cover, which was very old and fell apart. Thinking this was the same thing, I purchased one and was quite excited when I received it. However, when comparing this one to the older one, it is quite smaller. So now many of the other comments make sense. The older one covered almost the entire seat, top and bottom and could fit over the headrest. The older one also seemed built a little heavier. As for the string that holds the seat in place, these aren't too bad. Although they seem quite flimsy, they do last quite long. And the strings can be repositioned easily so that you can tie them where you need to."
4,Long Test Drive,"The cushion in my 12 year old minivan usually gives me a pain in the rear about 5 - 6 hours into a long drive. We were preparing for a 1,200 mile trip recently and this was a desperate attempt to make the drive tolerable. All NYC taxi drivers use some version of this, but I couldn't buy it on the street corner. To make a long story short, the cushion worked as advertised. Two days of 12 hour driving was far more tolerable with the cushion.If you want to get this, buy it before your long trip and plan to use bungee cords to make it stay in place. Otherwise, you'll end up giving this thing very low ratings."
5,Works great!,"I don't know what the fuss is, I've had mine for a month or two and it works great!I feed it through the headrest and with a short piece of cord, shoelace actually, tied it to the hand bar on the back of the seat of my Honda Odyssey. I don't bother tying the sides down. I am 6' 230lbs and have no trouble. Maybe for those with a superwide butt it would be.Works as adverstised, keeps the backside cool in the hot days of summer!Good quality, looks nice too."
2,"Again, no where to attach it.","Well, against my better judgment, I bought this thinking that the other people that weren't able to attach it just weren't mechanically inclined or good problem solvers. Bad move. The thing seems pretty well built and the beads are nice, but this thing just doesn't appear to have been made for the seat in a vehicle (what exactly it was made for, I'm not sure). It isn't even the correct shape for a car's bucket seat. You can stuff the thin part between your headrest, but it is wider than the pins so you gotta stuff it in there. I don't know what the people that make this thing were thinking.Would definitely not buy again nor recommend to anyone else."
1,Uncomfortable to me in an office chair,"I got this hoping for some ventilation during long work sessions in the summer months. It didn't work well and was uncomfortable. Also, it pulls on leg hair when wearing shorts. Maybe I'll try it in my car."
5,At last!!!,"After looking ALL OVER for beaded car seat covers (Neither Advanced Auto or Walmart had them) found these here at Amazon and ordered THREE. The nylon cording is good and strong and the beads substantial...and the whole product well made. These are perfect for velour seats like those in my Honda that catch at your clothes and bunch them all up in unattractive ways. Plus I think there really IS a massage action going on. A Plus, guys!!"
4,Your shoulders probably shouldn't be pressed against a car seat at any point in time,"I don't get all the complaints about this thing not being long enough; the wider portion really does not need to come all the way up to your shoulders because, presumably, your hands are going to be on the steering wheel, making it difficult to create anything resembling a pressure point there.Lay it so the bottom makes it to the back of your knee and throw whatever's left under the headrest. I didn't bother tying mine down at all because my headrest clamps it right in place. Much more comfortable than leather in the summer, and my britches don't bind up as much on long trips."
4,"Comfortable, durable cool looking....","It is as advertised, keeps your back, legs and rear end from over heating on long or hot drives. Fits good in my Infiniti FX drivers seat. I bought mine from Advance Auto Parts for 12.99. Amazon is overpriced on this item."
2,Sit gently....or it all over!,"I installed this, utilizing the cord provided, in my 2006 Hyundai Elentra the day after I received it. I used it 2 or 3 days and it worked wonderfully. On the 4th day I must have caught it getting in the car, because after my 1-1/2 hr drive to work, I got out, and beads started falling everywhere. It appears the plastic line they use broke. I'm working on fixing it now, but what a pain.P.s. There were no installation instructions provided. I assume I mounted it correctly.Wood Beaded Comfort Seat Cushion"
3,Comfy but not durable,"I have owned a couple of these, and they are very comfy and great for letting air circulate.The fishing line or whatever they use to hold it together, though, is pretty wimpy and has lasted at most a year with some care not to stress it too much. Once it breaks in one place, it's very difficult to stop the whole thing from unraveling."
2,Product image deceptive,We have had this product from another supplier a number of years ago. It was described as the French Taxi Driver Seat Cover. We enjoyed them and decided to replace them after they wore out. The picture of this product appeared to offer the same item as did the description. Upon arrival the item was visually and physically different from our earlier product. The coverage area was drastically reduced and the beads were smaller and finished at a much reduced quality. The head and neck portion in the image looks smaller then the other area but in reality it is the larger portion. So end effect was we got less product for more money.If someone had not enjoyed the REAL thing before they would not know the difference and would probably find it marginally useable and enjoyable....thus the 2* rating. Otherwise I would have rated it 1*.
4,Long drive savior,"Fast shipping, solid construction. Only problem is how to keep it in place. I used a bungee cord."
2,cost cutting,"i like the feel of the beads on my seat, back, and shoulders. My previous wood beaded seat cushion covered the entire seat back. My shoulders are off the seat cushion. It was held in place by sturdy straps. The strings provided where too short and too flimsy."
1,It is way too narrow.,"the Comfort Bead Wood Beaded Seat Cushion I got is different with the one I have seen on the website,it is 2 beads narrow everywhere than the picture above,I am a slim person and can not stand it,going to return it for sure.Comfort Bead Wood Beaded Seat Cushion"
2,Not what I thought,"The beads were fine - nothing torn or damaged however it was the installation thats a problem. Sure there are some strings - but on 99% of car seats, there is no way to secure the beads to the seat.I ended up using some twine to loop in and around the headreast. Works for now but certainly dosent look good. I fear its only a matter of time before it breaks."
4,how can hard wooden beads be so comfortable?,"The Komfort bead wood beaded seat cushion was purchased as a gag gift, but it truly is VERY comfortable! Keeps you cool on hot days when the car has been sitting in the sun. The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because I think it needs a better system to attach to the car seat itself. However, I did buy an extra one for my leather desk chair, figured out my own system for attaching it to the chair and it works great there too! Great product, shipment was prompt!"
4,No more sweaty seat!,"I got this for my home office chair to keep me cooler. It works very well, even when I'm working longer hours. The only downside is I must be cautious if I'm wearing shorts or it occasionally yanks my leg hair."
1,Boring,This DVD was a big disappointment. My toddler is obsessed with dancing and she loves some other dancing DVDs but this one was a big bummer and waste of money. It had a very homemade feel to it and the instructor was such a poor fit for young children; a subdued older woman. The prima princessa DVDs are wonderful. Get those instead!
5,Excellent!,I advise you to get Junior Jazz by Rosemary Boross. It's a very interesting and professionally built lesson. You will like it!
4,Beautifully Crafted,This is a very beautiful peice. It is smaller than expected with total lenghth approx 3 inches in length from top to tip. Sturdy silver construction. I received mine as a gift. It's perfect for marking a few pages and keeping your place. I just love it!
4,Tunde lights up his solo career,"Somehow the last Lighthouse Family studio album seemed disappointing: the sound and formula was right, but it appeared tired in comparison to its predecessors. Tunde's solo effort however, goes along way to recapture the original spirit and flavour of what made the Lighthouse Family so successful. Beautifully crafted songs, particularly Letting Me Down Gently and the unusually entitled but haunting Anaesthetic, run throughout. Others such as Our History and I have Never Walked Alone echo more successful Lighthouse Family Days. An excellent solo debut - which begs the question: Why the criminal lack of promotional airplay in the UK?"
1,"weak plot, weaker characters","First off, let me say I enjoy most of Huxley's work. The style of this book is totally different from the usual Huxley method. I've never read anything else by Christopher Isherwood. This book starts out boring, and ends boring. That's really the sum of it. The characters are flat and extremely simple. In his early work (say, pre ""Brave New World""), Huxley's characters are an embodiment of one single trait. However, they are always developed well, and their thought processes are complex while remaining within this one trait. This book has the same characterization - Jacob, for example, is moronically kind and simple (think Forrest Gump). There are also the classic evil tricksters, and so on. It's not done well at all, and I left this book with a bad taste in my mouth."
3,"Enjoyable fiction, its cinematic roots all too obvious.","When I read the book, I hadn't realized it was the result of a film project. But in restrospect that makes all the sense in the world. We meet Jacob in the 'present', shift to the 'story' which explains it all, and then return to the 'present'. We follow our protagonist through the adventures presented by his natural healing powers and his genuine love for a dreaming young women. Written in a clear straightfoward style, it was all too easy to forsee the results of each action. Description leads to the obvioius mental visualization, very cinematic. The main characters are well drawn, the plot flows smoothly, and the book is a compelling read. Not particularly challenging, just simple enjoyable recreational fiction."
5,His versatility on the mic is awesome!,"He starts this album right where he left the last one with ""Su unico amor"", a song who's delivery is truly his own. Overall, the whole album is great with 8 merengues, 1 cumbia, and 1 bachata song that was written by popular bachata singer, Joe Veras. Ladies will definitely like the remakes of ""Asi Fue"" and ""Un buen perdedor"" which to me sounds better than the original ballads. Production-wise, the merengues are mixed with a new-school, old-school feel that brings even the worst dancer to get groovy!!"
5,excellente,"wow, I really like it with a new idea of how to listen to a word, offering you a new piece of"
2,Not crazy about it,I bought this cause I thought it would have a lot of good music. Maybe the songs are good but they were notNecessarily to my liking. There were some good ones but for me very few.
2,not what I was expecting,This is not the music I was expecting to hear. I've heard some of the songs on regular radio stations. Others sound like they've been re-recorded.
2,Crushed Christmas,"I ordered three Christian CD's for my sister for Christmas and had them shipped to her. All the cases were broken, but the CD's were still functional. USPS did another poor job, probably running them through the automated stamping machine. A poorer job of packaging might have played a role in the demise of the plastic carriers also."
4,In Christ Alone!,"Let me start off by saying that the entire compilation was worth it, there are some very great performances on these CD's, and it's great to have my favorite songs featuring Avalon, Rachael Lampa, and others on a two disc set. I loved it, but what really stood out to me was this one song by Brian Littrell (who's already a platinum selling mega-star member of: The Backstreet Boys, no less) I absolutely enjoyed his soulful voice, the earnest plea and praise he offered to God in this song. I never expected to hear this side of him, simply amazing."
4,"Definetely ""A Kids CD"" and A kids review","This is an album for kids. It starts off with the uptempo beat ""with a child's heart"" which is great. Next the RAVEN SYMONE CLASSIC ""I can get down"" which my cousins and I love. After comes the Beat Boxin' "" Hip Hoppers"" in which she raps,raps,and just raps. The next two, slow but reasonable songs ""slow down"" and ""best friends"" are nice and calm.""People make the world go round"" is good, followed by ""bounce"" one of the best. You have ""I love you"" and ""lean on me"" which she expresses her concerns for her friends,also ""with a child's heart""(ballad version)a remake of MICHEAL JACKSON's version. Also ""pure love"" is way to slow for me. Then ""with a child's heart"" bonus mix is very good .Last is CH HOUSE MIX, so let your house comment on that one"
4,slamming!but too short,this cd is all that! Raven has talent galore! Why is the cd only 6 songs long? It must be 1 of 2 cds with 1 to follow. Please say it is otherwise i guess i'm only half hyped up.I say buy this under these circumstances. Luv ya! I'm out!
1,THIS CD IS GARBAGE,"U PEOPLE ACTUALLY LIKE THIS CRAP, HA HA HA HER VOCALS SUCK AND HOW MANY TIMES CAN U PUT ONE SONG ON A CD? THEY ACTUALLY GAVE HER A RECORD DEAL WOW I GUESS N E ONE CAN GET A RECORD DEAL THESE DAYS MY DOG SINGS BETTER THAN THAT!!!! I SEE WHY THEY CHARGED SO MUCH FOR IT CUZ NO ONE IS GOING TO BUY THE CRAP!!! RAVEN DON'T EVER DO THIS AGAIN, THIS CD SUCKS!!!!! STICK TO TELEVISION THAT'LL KEEP MONEY IN YOUR POCKET. STOP RECORDING MUSIC CUZ U SUCK VOCALLY NOW IF U WANT SOME REAL MUSIC PICK MARIAH CAREY NOW THATS TALENT!!!!"
2,SWEET & SOUR,"SOUR: This is a stage performance preserved on film. No effort has been made to alter the production to take advantage of the versatility of film. The scenes are dark; singers are obviously there - you can hear them but can only barely see them. This DVD is not at all suitable for viewing on a 4:3 CRT TV set, which is what I use.SWEET: Jose van Dam is fine as Falstaff but the other major singing roles are poorly represented.FOOTNOTE: The product description obviously is not describing this opera. Renato Bruson does not appear in this production.Bruson made a fabulous Falstaff but as far as I know the Royal Opera production is not available in DVD format."
1,What a disappointment!,"As Falstaff sings, ""all the world's a joke"" and so is most of this production. Gramaphone magazine went wild over the DVD. I think I would need some of what the critic was on to appreciate this production as much as they did. In one word, it's a BORE. If you've ever seen the classic Franco Zeffirelli Metropolitan Opera production which was just revived and given a ""make over"" last year, you would see why no other director or scenic designer need apply. Zeffirelli's take on this opera is definitive. Now if only we could get the Met to committ it to video.They only thing the Theatre Toyal de la Monnaire de Brusselles has going for it is a first class Falstaff in Jose Van Dam. The rest of the cast and conductor have nothing new to offer and the music just sort of plods along without any spirit or vitality.Save your money and wait for the Metropolitan DVD - if it ever happens. Perhaps a letter to Joseph Volpe and James Levine might work!"
2,Not the Best Bang for the Buck,I would like to start by saying I love Tetris and have been playing for years! That is why I felt it needful to tell all weary of this game to seak other games as options. The downfalls are greater for an older aged generation down-pitted with cheezy annoying music and lame Attari like graphics. As for a younger group of Tetris players this may just pass as fun.
1,BORING,"The object is to get the professor to the bottom. You do this by trying to get rid of rows.( Kind of like or Tetris games. ) 2 player mode is terrible. It is just like 1 player mode but the object is to keep the professor closest to the bottom. ( If you put a block on top of the professor, he will climb it. ) So I player against my sister. My sister tried to get rid of the rows and I tried to stack all the blocks on the side. ( So the professor doesn't climb them. And guess what? I won! Now what kind of strategy is that? I would get a adventure game or action game any day!"
3,More boring than I had remembered.,"I think I'm just getting older but this game bored the heck out of me. I remembered liking this in middle school but oh well.It is a mix of a puzzle game and classic tetris. If you like tetris or puzzles you might like this, however I would recommend looking on youtube for gameplay videos before purchasing it."
3,same old tetris,"Tetris is tetris....good classic version that i remember from years ago. Not as easy as i remember, but then again i am a little older!"
4,Compact and durable.,Just what I needed for my small loft laundry closet. It's passed the durability test by holding 2 jeans and 3 sweatshirts. Impressive! I did mount on to a stud wall and used longer screws than provided.
4,great product,Very helpful in the laundry room. Folds up nicely so that it is not in the way when not in use. Holds a lot of clothes.
5,"its plastic, but has held up so far","It makes some creaking every now and again, and it's just plastic; however, it is holding up and serving it's purpose. I'm using it on the back of my closet door to get a little extra hanging room."
5,Fabulous product,this product does what it needs to do and folds up when not needed. sturdy construction. prompt delivery and a great price.
4,Fits the bill,I was looking for something to hang my wet clothes on in the laundry room... This screwed right into the wall and is very sturdy.
4,Hanger Holder,"This is an inexpensive, handy, organizational item. Prior to buying the hanger holders, I had no way to hang up laundry. My laundry room is barely large enough to fit the washer & dryer. I installed them at a height that allowed the cabinet door to open fully. The Hanger Holders accommodate plenty of hangers (and I use the plastic ones), and fold up out of the way when not used."
4,Great for the laundry room!,Nice space saver. Gives you extra room to hang things without taking up space when not in use. Good for hanging lingerie and light shirts. Would buy again!
4,Great for when I iron,as expected..good price ..fast delivery..just what I was looking for.. thanks for having such a neat product..easy to install thanks
1,Doesn't work!,"Tech support guy said, ""it is the worst product we ever made and you should return it."""
2,Hawking back to dlink,Need upgrade firmware. Although I only used it for a month with cable & dsl service it seem slower than single service with my dlink router. It need refining
4,Works for me,I bought this as a backup for my expensive dual wan router and it has performed well. I updated the firmware to Ver 1.32 prior to hooking up and it recognizes both cable and dsl connections. DSL took a bit of finessing but it works.There is no ability to assign smtp to a specific wan which is a bit of a headache. Load balancing appears to lock you to one WAN so no bandwidth gain. With the little amount of time I've spent using this I'd recommend this for redundancy but not a bandwidth increase.I've used the H2WR54G for a little over a day and it's working much better than my broken $$$ router.
4,Movies Are Better,"Four stars for the basic stories, but I must admit it was because I so loved the movies made based on the books that I was compelled to read the books. However, I did not get far into the books before realizing I couldn't stomach the hillbilly dialog! I am SO glad they didn't do this in the movies, but made the actors talk pretty normal, even for pioneers. Part of the charm in the movies was Marty teaching Missy to read and correcting her grammer and bringing so many books with her in the wagon, etc. The people in the book sound like they have no education at all and it was very hard to read, so hard that I gave up reading the books. But I cannot recommend the movies highly enough!"
1,only if you like prairie historical books,"If your into little house on the prairie then you might like these books, I felt that they were very poorly written. The author writes the character's and the way they talk is just annoying, yeah that's how they used to speak back in those days but its just annoying. I didn't like that old dialect."
2,Not GOod,"Only two songs i like, ""Lay Me Down and leave the pieces. they are backwoods girls. not fit for singing."
5,Sweet!,The CD plays great! My best friend and I used to listen to this CD back in high school and I lost Mine so I'm thrilled to have it again... and in better condition then my old one!
2,Nothing special but could have been,"Having heard these young ladies on the radio and finding their harmonies reminiscent of The Kinleys, Dixie Chicks and SheDaisy, I bought the CD with nothing else to recommend it. It's a disappointment on a couple of levels.They have nice voices. Not great voices but nice, pleasant voices and they harmonize well. Not having a great voice can still work okay if there is something to say. On this recording, the material is weak. Very, very weak. Not one song is really interesting or stands out in the vast quagmire of today's country-pop radio playlist. Every song is immaculately produced to sound like everything else deemed worthy of radio airplay.This recording never rises above the level of mediocrity. On that level, it would rank three stars. However, there is obviously some talent here that needs someone or something to kickstart it. That is what is really disappointing and, because it could have been a better recording, I can only give it two-stars."
2,I was so excited and then disappointed....,"The first song off of this CD 'leave the pieces when you go' was so awesome that I ran out to buy this CD when it was released. I have to admit that I was a little disappointed. It was really the only good song on it. I loved Michelle Branch and her lyrics were always so touching and true; so well written. The other lyrics on this album are just not up to her standards. If you are the type of person who can listen to music without ever knowing the words to the song, then you will probably love this album. The music itself is pretty good. I just wish a couple of the songs were not on here...#12 Crazy People, esp. This song was horrible!! I'm glad it was almost the last song or I probably wouldn't have listened to the rest of the album."
3,Sounds like so many other country-pop albums these days,"Sorry. I liked Michelle Branch's first lp, though her 2nd one was unremarkable. Maybe that's why she switched up and decided to go pop-country.There is nothing really wrong with this record, other than the fact that it sounds so much like every other female country pop record out there these days. The Dixie Chicks come to mind, and even their sound grew old after their first album.Sorry, but this just doesn't do it for me. What I object to with all this new country pop is the production. It all sounds so slick and produced. I'd much rather hear just a tight 4 piece band using guitar, banjo, mandolin, bass fiddle and so on, in an acoustically produced vein. This pop sound has grown tiresome."
3,Okay,"As many of you probably have, I listened to this album because it had Michelle Branch in it. I have to say that the vocals with Jessica Harp are fantastic and the sound of the songs are nice, but most of the songs aren't that great. Leave the Pieces is a nice song, but not that great. The only ones I enjoyed are Lay Me Down, Rain, The Good Kind, and Tenessee. The rest is mediocre. My, Oh My for instance is just plain boring. Rain is a great song, which sounds exactly as if it came off Hotel Paper, and isn't country at all. Lay Me Down isn't a truly great song, but I really enjoyed it. The Good Kind is a nice sounding song, and the melody reminds me of Breathe. Tenessee is a really good song.I hope this review was helpful."
5,Blown Away in Virginia,"I'm an ex-60's drummer (Rock & Country) and had never even heard of Michelle and Jessica before. I read a review of ""The Wreckers"" andbought the CD. Their music has so super-charged me to the pointthat I have pulled out my drums (after many years) to play alongas their mesmerizing harmonies and rock-solid musicianship meltthe years away. I highly recommend this CD to anyone andam a ""My,Oh My"" fan!"
4,refreshing in Nashville Music City,this stripped down yet not under produced recording is a refreshing twist for the Nashville music scene and beyond...catchy tunes and amazing harmonies...hope this is a sign of more authenic music to come!
5,Pleasantly Pleased,"Heard ""Leave the Pieces"" and decided to take a chance & buy the cd. Money well spent. I'll be surprised if a couple of other hits don't spin off from the cd as well.On 11/10/06 We'll be hearing them in concert!(Touring with Little Big Town & Montgomery Gentry). If they perform as well as they do on this cd, it will be more money well spent!"
5,organic sound,"Michelle and Jessica have worked on this album so much time. I wouldn't label it country i'm not in it and I am in love with it.I think the perfect match between their voices, the acoustic guitars' sound and the lyrics it's enough reason to buy the album, cause really it's worth it."
3,Not to bad,"I wasn't overly impressed by this. Maybe becuz I was expecting more of the Michelle Branch I was used to. But I can't get enough of the first song ""Leave the Pieces"" Absolutely worth the buy for that song alone"
4,Michelle goes country,I have been a fan of Michelle Branch's music for some time and I eagerly awaited the release of her next album. This collaboration with Jessica Harp is a serious break from the genre of music that Michelle wrote for her previous releases. She has taken on a very country sound but as ever she does it well. I would recommend this album for anyone who is looking for something to chill out and relax to and I cannot wait to see what her next album will bring.
2,Disappointing...,"I love Michelle Branch, I have her debut album (great album, wonderfully done), and her 2nd album (beautiful/gorgeous album, even better then the firsy) so I had some pretty high expectations for this album.It's not necessarily that this album is bad, but it's just nowhere near up to par with Michelle's earlier material. The only saving graces on this album are ""Tennessee"" and ""Lay Me Down"" (""Lay Me Down"" is an especially beautiful song, if anything, this album is worth it for this song alone). These two tracks are up to par with Michelle's normal standards, which is simply writing a wonderful tune.Michelle is better on her own. Maybe her partner in crime for this group is the faulty part to this album. Whatever it may be, I'm waiting for the next Michelle album."
2,A rather sad dissapointment,"I heard the song ""Leave the Pieces"" on the radio this morning, so I bought the CD since I liked the song. Other than that one song, I am very dissapointed in the very poor singing abilities of the two singers: their voices are infantile and immature, and the song material is insipid and puerile. This CD will appeal to thirteen-year-old girls, but I doubt an adult will find it worth the cost. A few of the songs are so bad that one might be compelled to believe they were made that way on purpose, as a parody of what can only be call reaking garbage.This is not Country music, which was another dissapointment. At best it can be called ""pop.""I very much recomend that people listen to the CD before they pay for it."
3,nice,"I like this CD for the most part, but was hoping some of he songs would be a little more rock oriented like some of Michele Branch 's earlier stuff."
5,wreckers have a great album,"great new group with a easy to listen to style, good songs, and great harmony.......am waiting for another new album as I enjoy this one....they have written and produced an album that you will enjoy if you like the country sound."
2,Too much pop,"After hearing Leave the Pieces on the radio, I decided to try the whole album. I was dissappointed because it was not what I was expecting. Currently, I am very into Carrie Underwood, Shannon Brown and Miranda Lambert. These women have a real country sound mixed with just a pinch of pop. Although the Wreckers harmonize very well, I found the sound to be much more pop than I was hoping for (I'd say 40% country, 60% pop). It's not that it's a bad CD, but I wouldn't recommend it to someone who's a country fan to begin with; it's more for someone who was a big Michelle Branch fan initially."
5,"Stephanie, qu'est qu'il y a?","Je parle francais. Mais, je ne comprends pas ce que vous avez a traduire: l'information sur la logicile ou bien les remarques de ceux qui l'a achete....Tant mieux, je ne sais pas pourquoi je vous reponds. Promlement, je ne vais pas retourner a cette page. Ah, je sais: J'avais envie te tapper en francais:)"
4,Trunk Organizer,Fits great in the back of my mid-size SUV. Holds about 4 bags of groceries. I wish the separator in the middle was adjustable.
2,this is not alt-country,"alt-country, a genre exemplified by artists such as uncle tupelo, wilco, and whiskeytown, is put to shame on this disc. with a voice like a cracked-out bob dylan and lyrics that reak like a concert festival port-o-john, jesse malin delivers 13 already-been-done songs.i bought this cd under the misdirection that malin was a neo-springsteen. and he is...exactly. and therein lies the problem. he's breaking no new ground and doing so with a subpar talent.i was also excited that ryan adams had produced this album. this was nothing more than stupidity on my part seeing as how adams has not written a good song since heartbreaker.if you want to hear springsteen, buy some springsteen. if you want to hear ryan adams buy heartbreaker or some whiskeytown. and if you want to hear alt-country, check out:lucero: tennesseeuncle tupelo: anywilco: anywhiskeytown: strangers almanac, pneumoniaplease do not purchase this album."
4,Come On People....,"The reviews here are more about Ryan Adams than Jesse Malin. If you hate Ryan Adams, go trash his CD's on Amazon. (Or did you already do that?) This CD is great. His voice is amazing in a lonesome, cry-over-spilled-beer sort of way. How can any of you flatliners not love Queen of the Underworld or Almost Grown??????"
3,Decent Solo Effort,"Malins solo effort definitly gets athumbs up, however hwat happend to Mr.Rocknroll?If you like D-gen or Malin check out 17 Crash(...)"
1,Are you kidding?,It's amazing how untalented some people can actually be. Would anyone actually listen to this guy if Ryan Adams wasnt on the album? The answer: No.Squirt hot glue in your ears then listen to a drunk sing on a subway platform and you'll get the same effect.
5,good stuff,"don't waste your time reading this. It's a really solid cd, kinda like a strange inner-thigh rash in that it just slowly but surely grows on you. you don't know where it came from. you want to scratch it away at first. then one day you're in the shower and you realize, hey, that's alright. ummm...he sounds a bit like bruce springsteen, sometimes like jagger vocally, and the obvious ryan adams comparison is deserved. if you like ryan adams or pete yorn, then you will hopefully become as close to this album as that rash you keep telling yourself will go away."
1,Don't Buy - Take Your Cash Elsewhere,"I had the same problems as already stated. I am currently having the volume issue as well, and yes my batteries are weak (the light is on).The first unit I bought lasted two weaks and then there was no sound at all. I called Sharper Image and they agreed to send a replacement. I waited two weeks and nothing. I called again and they had no record of my previous phone call. They did send a replacement and told me it would be sent overnight if ""deemed appropriate by management."" It was not shipped overnight.Bottom line - this product is awful. Do not buy - I regret it! It is worth it to spend more money on a different product. This only has a 90 day warranty and it doesn't last quite that long."
1,piece of junk,I too had a Sony for YEARS and replaced it with this radio. Big mistake- even when I buy brand new batteries they are dead. Literally the low battery light flashes and all I get is static. Save your self the money and don't buy this hunk of junk!
3,It's really not THAT bad!,"Had mine for 2-3 years now. Normal battery life so I can't compare my story to the ""one star"" stories. Like it well enough that I'm looking to purchase the power adapter now--but there's no owner's manual online that I can find and I don't know what type to get. It's been fine by us; bummer that Sharper Image is in bankruptcy."
1,Manufactured with known defect,It seems that toshiba manufactured these machines with a known defect in which the CPU needs to be throttled back in order to keep the laptop from shutting down due to over heating. The cause of this issue is that Toshiba used a desktop CPU (Intel Pentium III) instead of a mobile CPU in these laptops. Toshiba's solution to the problem is a BIOS update which effectively throttles back the clock speed of the CPU and causes some issues with DVD playback. This defect is also present in the satellite 5505 series laptops.
1,Do not buy this computer,"This computer has been a disaster. The modem has never worked once. When I call tech support, they blame it on my settings, my ISP, or my OS, pending their mood. The monitor flickers and goes dark on a daily basis for hours at a time. I have sent the computer in twice to be ""fixed"" only to get back a machine that works for a short period of time before the flickering problem returns. They kept ""fixing"" my problems for just long enough, so that my warranty could expire and now they could say tough luck. I would never buy a lousy Toshiba product again."
4,Affordable with all features,"... Great notebook for this price.CD-RW/DVD works great. Battery life decent. Screen colors and size superb.2 minor complaints:1. The keys are not in standard place. Start key at top. Home,Bckspc,Del all at non-standard places.2. Jack for Dial-up connection is again in a bad place. Just in front of DVD rom. So if you open the drive, it gets stuck by the phone wire.I have recommended it to all my friends."
1,dont eva buy toshiba,"dont ever buy a toshiba pruduct. worst customer service. if something is wrong with the computer, they will hold it for months and then send it back ""fixed"". It never stays fixed and computer will repeat problem within months of being ""fixed"". i hate toshiba!!!"
1,what a piece of junk,I have had this computer for 6 months and it has been nothing but a problem. It shuts down whenever it wants to. I have had the hard drive crash and 3 cdrom combo drives. As of now I have had no satisfaction from Toshiba. They just keep sending boxes and I just keep sending it back.
3,Is the Cpu Fan too loud or is it just mine ?,"The cpu fan of my laptop (1805-s274) is too loud compared too other laptops.Is it norml to be like that , or did i got a defect laptop ."
4,Good value but HEAVY,"This computer has performed up to my expectations and, in my opinion, it's the best value on the market now. One word of caution though, it's HEAVY. It's not really something you want to carry around for a long time."
3,You take the good with the bad,"I have owned the Toshiba 1805-S254 for 3 years now. it has been a pretty reliable computer overall. No problems with the DVD or issues with ports of any kind. If I can fault this computer, it would be the ever persistent overheating issue everyone mentions. My laptop started to overheat 3 months or so after I purchased it. It is indeed a design flaw, and I believe it to be mainly the cause of dust. Dust gets stuck in the fan screen, and ends up overheating the laptop. While the problem is persistent, it can be helped by a) having your laptop slightly elevated so that it does not have dirrect contact with the desk, and b) blowing air into the fan opening to clear at least some of the dust out.The only other I have had is a battery issue. Mainly, that the battery is pretty much dead and takes very little charge. (it lasted perfectly 2 years) I can't say however that this is a product fault since most batteries are expected to last 2-3 years."
3,Similar to a pocket knife,It is hard to use this without doing some damage to the case. I was expecting something that is easier to use. The cutting edge can easily cut into the case.
5,Really handy watch case opener,"This knife, watch opener is really handy for popping the back off of a quartz watch. Could use a regular knife blade, but why mess it up when you can use this inexpensive opener."
1,Does not work,"Tried using this on my Timex, which is an ordinary (read: cheap) watch. Yet this tool cannot do anything to open it, it is even thicker than the blade on my Swiss army knife, which I tried unsuccessfully to open it. I thought this is a specialized tool that can do a better job than a regular knife. Lessons learned. Not sure why it is even called a watch opener, it probably can only open a watch cheaper than its value."
1,Not worth the effort or cost,I tried this product on 5 watches but could only open one. The product is actually well made but doesnt work on most watches. One huge problem is that everytime the blade slips off the back of the watch cover it hits your thumb. One blood thumb which I hit numerous times and the fact that it did not open most types (all of my watches were different backs) makes me rate this product poorly.
3,Opening a watch is weird enough without risking a cut,It's nice to have an actual watch opener when you need it and not risk your safety with a pocket knife.
3,"Good, does the job for the price.",Worked ok for me. Wish there was some sort of guard to protect you hands if it slips as it is pretty sharp. The reason for the 3 stars is that I wish the blade at the end was a bit thinner. It works after a bit of struggling and is ok for the price.
3,Not for the lefthanded,I am left handed and can't use it. Beveled for right hand use. Common problem for us lefties. My husband uses it for me so I can still get the batteries changed in my watches. He likes it.
1,"SE Hn7 knife, watch opener","In my judgement, cheap looking, not sharp enought to catch the back over of the watch, had to use my Swiss army knife to pry watch cover off. Not recommended, waste of money."
3,disappointed,it doesn't work. I could't open my watch case yet.My watch is Casio. I don't know why it can't open my watch.
3,Hefty feel but the point was bent upon delivery,"I like the heft of the SE watch case knife. It feels like a solid keep it for a life time tool. However, mine arrived with a bent point. It came in an un-damaged plastic envelope and there was no indication that it was damaged in shipping so I can only guess that it went into the box damaged. The tip was easy to re-sharpen but I can't in all honesty give high marks for a product that can't be used without ""fixing"".This is another necessary tool for anyone who has a lot of battery operated watches and changes them him/herself. Yes, the bent tip is a minor quibble and yours probably won't arrive like mine."
1,Did not do the job,"I have watches with no notch in the back to enable a small screwdriver to be inserted to pry off the back to change the battery. I thought I was going to have to throw them away. I was very frustrated. I was hoping this product would be thin enough to fit between the back and the watch case. It was not. In fact, a number of my small screwdrivers were much thinner. It didn't work at all. However, I also ordered the Adjustable Snappy Case Opener advertised on Amazon. It worked beautifully! It wasn't really thin enough to slip under the watch backs and at first I thought it wasn't going to work, but I just positioned it against each back, pushed down(it has a spring action), and the watch backs popped right off!"
3,"Worked, mostly","This is a case of getting what you paid for. Considering the price I cannot complain, as it was able to eventually open watch cases better than anything I already had. Using it I learned a lot about opening cases, as I wound up initially scratching a few case backs before I got them open. Sometimes the problem just seemed to be with the particular watch. You will need instructions, so I strongly recommend viewing how to videos online before attempting to remove any cases. There may be much better tools but I would guess they are much more expensive. After a lot of practice I did get better using the tool."
5,Prong's Best By FAR!!,"Cleansing is the pinnacle of Prong's career. This album just plain kicks ass! They utilize lots of layered riffs that are sampled and looped in the background to create a really dense, heavy sound. The riffs are mammoth, and pretty much every track has a tight metal groove. Crystal clear production sets this apart from Prove You Wrong and Beg to Differ. Heavier than their previous works, yet without the ""dance"" feel of their newer stuff."
5,one of the most underrated cds ever,"well, i can't understand, why this lp has never even got a bit of mass appreciation. while other bands which are also underrated like helmet, life of agony etc. are at least well enough know with certain people i really know nobody except me who knows prong. too bad for them, cause this is one of my favourite metal cds. (along with helmet's strap it on, machine head's burn my eyes etc.) i think this one's a classic. i really love it. the riffing sometimes reminds me of helmet, but still it seems unique enough. the sound is harsh and cold, very angry, but still kinda emotionless. also it has some nice industrial elements. if you like this i recommend helmet, machine head, strapping young lad and ministry"
5,I don't get the Metallica reference at all.,"Will Killing Joke ever get the credit they deserve?? ""Noisy""? ""Industrial""? My god, compared to Backstreet Boys I guess, sure. Don't judge from the reviews, take a listen and see if you like it - - Prong strikes me as a love-or-hate kind of venture. I would compare them less to Metallica than to early Killing Joke (but if all you know is Love Like Blood, forget I mentioned them), Chrome, Swans, Pantera; I hear a Motorhead influence, but maybe that's just to say that it is a metal album after all :-) This album is very melodic, and highly proficient without being merely flashy."
3,Good but not great!,I kind of gambled with this cd. Somtimes it pays off and sometimes...... It's not quit what I thought it would be. But I don't really know what I was expecting. Snap your fingers snap your neck is a killer track. The only really killer track on the cd.
5,An excellent tool for both pastor and layperson,"Neither Give Place is absolutely spellbinding. I keep thinking ""why didn't I think of this?"" It is the tool that I have been waiting for in my ministry. In this day when there are so many hurting and dysfunctional people, it is important that ministers such as myself have tools that prepare us to help these people. This book is that tool."
4,a good start!,"This text is an explantation of the recipe for the ""race"" issue in the world. I was impressed by the amount of information that is included in the book (historically speaking) and enjoyed Brace's casual and sometimes funny/snide comments throughout the text but wish he was not so scatter brained. This text would have been better had it included more discussion on The Atlantic Slave Trade and its effects in the US and England and not so much on France and the French scholars/scientists/anthropologists and their influence (although discounting them would be fallacy as well). I bought this for a college course I was taking but I'm definitely not selling it back. I love it."
1,Awful. Godawful.,"You can change your band name, but you can't change the fact that you're still not that good. Legends of Rodeo [or The Legends of Rodeo, I'm not quite sure which one it is] used to be The Recess Theory, but, according to their press sheet, they felt that there were too many bands with ""theory"" in their name, and they wanted to be original. How ironic. If you really wanted to be original, why did you insist on putting 5 tracks of bland, repetitive, 4th rate emo/watered down indie rock on your CD? I wish I could write more about this, but there really isn't much more to say. There is no reason that you should buy this, simply because theres dozens of other bands who are better at it. Case closed."
3,Lukewarm and somewhat boring,"Some of the essays in this book made you think, made you muse and ponder certain ideas. Some of the essays were flat out BORING. The last section, ""The Lighter Side,"" made trudging through the rest of the book worthwhile. But it didn't make it GOOD, necessarily. I though this was going to be a small book of summarized and commentated-on current events. Wrong. Half of the essays are about things most people could give a hoot about. All in all, the book was disappointing."
1,An influential man's farewell,"First anger, then sadness, as I read the musings of a network news anchorman at the dawn of a new millennium. Audrey Hepburn, Elvis, Charles Kuralt and other heroes are gone now, and so is the author's authority and relevance. The man who was upbraided by George Bush in a live TV interview now watches George Junior inexplicably move forward to fill the breach. The man who helped bring down a President finds himself embarrassed by the way a President younger than he brings himself down. There's true pathos in these essays by a man who once influenced Kings, but now worships the lowly Don Imus. Dan Rather bravely admits he has passed the baton to a new generation with standards perhaps lower than his, but with a bare honesty he could never bring himself to achieve. Here, he tries to break loose the network bonds that he inadvertantly helped create.A poignant end to an influential career."
1,Rather disappointing...,"The ""commentaries"" you hear on the radio are usually bits that are written on deadline, reacting to news stories or events-- spur of the moment stuff to fill time between the denture ads--but they ain't the stuff of literature or books-- at least not stuff you pay good money for. And I did. This ain't Paul Harvey. But what's more frustrating is that even though the book tries to touch on all the demographics-- from Clinton to Elvis... the crackerbarrel philosophin' don't ring true (and neither does the story about his wife almost marrying The King). If Dan wants folks to care about what he thinks about things, next time maybe he ought to maybe think about taking a sabbatical or at least a vacation to sit down at his estate and write something real. What'll they sell us next-- a book of his intros from the Evening News? (and according to the credits, he don't write them, either!)"
2,Shallow and Predictable,"With all due respect to a man who has had a great career on television, I frankly am shocked at this ""book"". It amazes me how little ""in touch"" the author is with the world he has been reporting about all these years.The ""Love Me Tender"" Elvis story is corny and just plain silly. The ""When Their Sixty-four"" story is not only stupid, it clearly shows that Dan completely missed a generation. By the way, when WAS the last time Bob Dylan revised his thought ""never trust anyone over thirty""? Dan, are you sure it was Dylan who said that?"
2,"pretty pictures,pretty poor info","I looked forward to this book giving me the info I needed for planning my short port stops in the 3 Alaskan towns that I will be visiting. It doesn't take into consideration port times and misses Haines altogether. When they note a restaurant stop, there is no information about it. The pictures give you an idea of what photos to take or postcards to buy butI don't think that I will even pack it."
2,Boring book,Not what i thought it would be.It was boring to read and i was very dissappointed that i ever bought it.
1,bad,"Very cheap earrings, bends like aluminum would not recommend them to anyone. Was expecting more than cracker jack box quality."
4,A handy little book!,"Let's Learn a Little Hawaiian is a handy little pocket-sized book. It gives translations of many male and female names into Hawaiian versions. The English to Hawaiian list is fairly extensive, and the Hawaiian expressions are cute. The only thing this book lacks is grammar. But for a take along quick dictionary, this book is great!"
4,Decent pop album,"Ryan Cabrera may have gotten exposure thanks to girlfriend Ashlee Simpson, but one spin of Take It All Away and it's obvious this guy's got more talent than Ashlee could ever dream of. Most of the songs are formulatic pop songs about being in love, lusting for love, or feeling bad because you're not in love. However, Cabrera knows how to write a catchy song and has a good, strong voice full of conveying the necessary emotion and he also has capable range.""On The Way Down"", ""True"", and ""40 Kinds Of Sadness"" were wise choices at singles - ""True"" isn't a traditional radio song but it worked quite well and ""40 Kinds Of Sadness"" has cheesy lyrics but is a pretty decent pop songs.Other highlights include ""Echo Park"" and ""Exit To Exit."" With a little more practice and some more time, Cabrera could join the ranks of John Mayer and Dave Matthews."
5,Ryan cabrera-takeit all the way..AWESOME!!!,I love ryan cabrera and he has an amazing album..his lyrics are so real and relatable! GO out and buy it! IT is soooooo worth it!
1,1 Star=Too Kind,"Seriously, you simply cannot enjoy this stuff--it's a bunch of white-bread mush! If you like acoustic rock, check out Howie Day--at least he's got a bit of edge to him--Dashboard Confessional also rock . . ."
1,"Here's the Truth, if you can handle it","There is no functional difference between the music of Ryan Cabrera and the music of Air Supply. None at all. It's the same warm vomit. I have to listen to ""True"" at the gym. No, I correct that -- I just went to get noise-cancelling headphones, so there's a slim chance that the next time I work out, this awful dreck doesn't have to seep into my ears. I heard ""True"" today and I raced home just so I could look it up on-line and see who did it, so at least I can hate it properly. Go ahead, click on ""Air Supply's Greatest Hits"" and tell me I'm wrong. I dare you."
1,"Two Bad Singles, One Horrible Disc","True is the current worst song ever! And On The Way Down is a close second. Do you want to get ANY disc that has those horrible songs on them??? I didn't think so. The other songs are not that bad, but ""True"" is so truthfully horrible that I get sick thinking of listening to it. The spanglish version isn't too stellar either- hey, it's at least something different! The worst part is, its the only song playing on z100 right now! Go to Eminem's album ""Encore"" and listen to the song ""Puke."" That is how to recover from the true worst song ever."
2,WHAT?,"This dude is horrible. He sounds like a little whiny boy crying. I only give him credit on his guitar skills, but man this dude sings like a crappy Johnny Reznick and he sucks too. Thats why Ashlee dumped his whiny self, but I guess shes kind of whiny too, I used to sleep with her. If you want a better album of this genre try Maroon 5 or John Mayer they are much better."
3,Good start...,I gave this album 3 stars because although it's a pretty good album Ryan still lacks some abillities.
5,Excellent Major Label Debut by Ryan Cabrera!,"When I first heard the single, ""On the Way Down"", on the radio, I knew right away that Ryan Cabrera had something special going on. After purchasing his cd (and major label debut) Take It All Away, I knew that my first thoughts had been confirmed. Since purchasing the album, I have continually listened and absolutely love it! His sound is refreshing and unique, as demonstrated on such tracks as ""True"" and ""Echo Park"". I can't wait to hear more from this up-and-coming talent, if this album is any indication of what else is to come. I would highly recommend this album to anyone and everyone!"
5,Ryan Cabrera's debut album is awsome!,Ryan did a great job with his first album. He is an amazing artist with an awsome voice. This is a cd you could listen to from begining to end. Its so hard to pick a favorite song because they are all so good. I would have to say that two of my favorites are 'Let's Take Our Time' and 'True'.
5,Ryan Cabrera's New Album,"You might have sen Ryan Cabrera on The Ashlee Simpson show, as Ashlee's Best Friend, But now he has taken his fame to the next level. He has a new cd out in stores called Take It All Away. Its a great cd! everybody should get it. There is a total of 12 songs on the cd. The track Listings are 1.) Lets Take zour time, 2.)On The Way Down, 3.) True, 4.) Exit To Exit, 5.) 40 Kinds Of Sadness, 6.)Echo Park, 7.)Take It All Away, 8.) Shame On Me, 9.)She's, 10.) Illusions, 11.) Blind Sight, 12.) On The Way Down Acoustic Version. My personal favorite is On The Way Down Acoustic. I guartantee that You will love this album. There is nothing not to love about him and his music, its just great."
4,Unique enough,"Ryan Cabrera's debut Take It All Away proves an up-and-comer that definitely has some potential. Though his voice isn't always as unique and different as some other male artists today (which seems to be the trend these days as seen in rival Jesse McCartney), his light wispiness and frequent head voice melismas prove his reasons for being a star. Opening Jessica Simpson's successful Reality Tour 2004 certainly didn't hurt his popularity, or being frequently featured in on-and-off girlfriend Ashlee Simpson's TV show, nor the song material itself. Like McCartney, Cabrera co-wrote some songs and even co-produced the record himself showing his marketability and savviness. Though not as universally good-looking as co-pop star Jesse McCartney, one thing --musically-- Ryan has going in his favor is his more unique voice (though still bland). In the end, though, Take It All Away is a record you're not likely to want to once you hear it."
5,Great CD,"I have to agree with a few other reviews. The CD is one that you can listen to endlessly. I was sick of ""On the Way Down"" because it was overplayed on the radio. While I was wandering through a local store I got Ashlee Simpsons CD and as a second impulse got Ryan Cabrera's CD. I liked this CD more that the other. The acoustic version of the song was amazing. It put a new spin and made it better. Together the songs sound great, but many of them sound the same in the words of my family. I would give this CD an A- just for the song similarity."
4,Props to Ryan Cabrera on a solid album.,"I was quite impressed with Ryan's debut 'Take It All Away'. My favorite songs on the album were ""Let's Take Our Time"" and ""Shame On Me"". The only reason I don't give the album 5 stars is because some of the songs sound somewhat repetitive of others. But otherwise, a good album."
5,FANTASTIC!!!!,"i absolutely loooove this album. ry is a very talented young man : ) he is a breath of fresh air. he is a singer/song writer/guitar player/producer/AMAZING person and the list just goes on and on. this cd is one of the VERY few that u can listen to the whole thing on repeat and NOT skip ANY songs...i bought 2 copies, one for the house and one for the car,lol...i know u can burn cds, but the cd is not expensive at ALL, so y not get more that one copy and support him as well : ) this cd is up beat and is very well written. u can pour ur lil heart out and sing in the shower or u can crank it up and sing along with it in ur car.so if u dont already have it, go out and get it. ry is very greatful for all his fans and he deserves all the love, support and SUCCESS in the WORLD : )"
2,A beginning . . .,"Well, the guy has some talent. Properly nurtured, he might go on to do some more consequential work. In the meantime, it is another case of a young artist put before the world prior to when he/she has lived enough to have anything interesting to say. I'm inclined to see this album as another in a long list of ""pabulum for the sleepers."""
5,Ryan Rocks!,"Ryan's cd has to be the best cd to be released this summer. He writes songs that people can relate to and he's original. His album shows his writing ability, guitar talent, and his amazing voice. If you don't have his cd yet, I suggest you go get it now!"
5,Such a great album,"This was such a great CD! I must admit that although I loved the song ""On the way down"", I really only bought this album because he was dating Ashley Simpson and I had seen him perform a bit on her show. When I picked up this album though and popped it into my CD player I was so pleased, with songs like ""True"", ""She's"", ""Lets Take our time"" and ""Illusions"", I must say that Ryan Cabrera, although he looks like just another hot pop star wannabe is such a great gutairist/singer/songwriter."
4,ryans cd!,"this cd is pretty good. i love his voice, some songs i like more than others...the simple ones are the best i think like 'TRUE'. he wrote/cowrote all the songs, played guitar and helped produce- so overall the cd is really impressive"
5,Amazing!,He has an amazing voice. And he is an amazing writer. He writes with passion and sings with soul. Its an up lifting CD with amazing melodies! He is simply put.... AMAZING!
5,A CD You Can Listen from front to back.,Basically I am going to say that this album is one of the few albums that I can listen to the whole thing. And every song is incredible and it's one of my favorite albums that I bought this year. So I recommand everyone to buy this you will not be disappointed.
5,Ryan Cabrera rocks!,"Hey people! Did u know that Ryan's new cool cd is in stores now! Anyways, I love Ryan's cd. I don't think I would get tired of it because it is amazing and awesome! I love it a lot! All of his songs have a good beat and Ryan writes his own stuff. Well, you should really think about getting his new cd. Oh yeah, if you turn in the receipt to some address you can get a acoustic guitar signed by Ryan! (...)"
5,Worthy of a listen,"I have to admit, I was a little skeptical when I went out to purchase this album. Like most, I had heard the single ""On the Way Down"" on the radio, and it was definetly catchy. So I figured I should give the rest a listen. I wasn't disappointed. He has a very sultry voice, and isn't bad to look at :). All in all, it is a very lyricly pleasing album, and definetly one that leaves you singing for hours after you turn it off."
5,Ryan Cabera,"Ryan Cabera is coming up in a big way. His album is a must have for the car or house. ""Shame On Me"" is one of my favorite songs along with ""Exit to Exit"". The former gives a fun, sassy sense while the latter plays to your emotions and is one that just about everyone can relate to. Go out and pick up this album. He opened for Jessica Simpson on her tour and if you didn't then make sure to catch him on one of his independent shows."
2,...,"Ryan Cabrera sounds like hes trying to be the new John Mayer. The only difference is John Mayer has some slow songs, and some upbeat songs. Ryan Cabrera needs more upbeat songs if he plans to stay around for a year. Right now, he blows. I feel sorry for anyone who buys his cd."
3,Give it a preview first,"I have to admit, I only bought this CD because my daughter enjoyed the radio singles. Unfortunately, having heard it, I still take that stand. It is not actually a bad album, but I just feel that it is lacking in charisma and variety. Ryan has a nice, easy to listen to voice and a catchy pop sound, but I find that most of his songs sound very similar. For example, I confuse Exit to Exit with 40 Kinds of Sadness sometimes. Nothing stands out as being all that different and no song truly draws me into Ryan's world.That said, if you like the radio singles (On The Way Down, True, and especially 40 Kinds of Sadness) you just might enjoy listening to the rest of this recording. Expect a nice voice and pop-sounding music, but don't expect mindblowing lyrics or experimental music. Ryan is all about cheerful, predictable pop music and there is nothing wrong with that if that is your style."
4,Just the start,This album is a great start for such a young artist. He is a very unique person. His voice is like that of Dave Mathews and or Bono. His writing style shows he is a young artist and with all the time he has to grow musical his writing will also. His music isn't the best and with his talent could be better. But we all know this is how all artists start. Like a bud of a flower he bloom into the great singer/song writer he will be.
4,Hitcooper.com Review,"Do you like John Mayer, The Goo Goo Dolls, Ben Jelen... or any of those young, singer/songwriter types? If so, you will LOVE this album... and you will love Ryan Cabrera. He has a great voice that's easy to sing along with, thoughtful lyrics and he's fun to look at too! Hitcooper.com picked him as a featured artist (there's an interview and review on the site), which is proof that he's worth checking out..."
3,Pleasant Pop,"The first two tracks are great, but by the time you get further into the CD, the songs all start to sound the same. Pleasant enough from this talented young guy, with the promise of better things to come."
5,Great CD!,"I really think Ryan is a great singer. He has great vocals, guitar skills, and he's just well, great! I first heard about him on the Ashlee Simpson show that i saw like 5 times. I didn't really know him nor care about him. Once i heard his single On the Way Down, that was my favorite song. So i got the Cd for My Bday. I listened to all the songs and i really liked them. I especially like Illusions, #10. Its a really good song. All the songs rock so go buy the album if you don't have it already. Seriously, he is very talented. People...there is nothing about him to complain about so keep your mouths shut you guys who are jelous of him."
3,Pretty Good,If you like this music you should check out Joe Sneva. www.joesneva.com I saw him when I was in Seattle and I became a huge fan. It's a sweet collection of rap/pop acoustic songs. Really sounds like the summer.
5,Ali's review 4 the hottest singer around!!,"OMG!!!! Ryan Cabrera is the...best..hottest..most wonderful(!!!) new singer out there rite now! I'm SoOoOoO jealous of Ashlee Simpson(they date) cuz not only is ryan sexi and sweet, hes a SUPER good musician!! I LOVE YOU RYAN!!!!!!!"
1,(shakes heads in sadness),"When a 21 year old is singing songs about ""eternal love"" to 9-15 year old girls...it time to go inside and watch wrestling!!!"
1,Sucky,"I haven't even listen to this recycled garbage called an album, Its sad to think that people actually wasted money on this cliche' john mayer pansy. I cant phathom why people would consider this the ""best album ever"". I guess these are the type of people that spend their days watching MTV and checking on-line for the new fads. I can assure you that i can name at least 300 albums that are better than this one. This is the type of album stores hand out when you but their ""new hot tanktop"". Everyone who likes or listens to this album has no musical taste nor an IQ over 20.My AOl screenname is BK42585 if you would like to talk about this"
4,just what I was looking for,"This shoe was exactly what I had in mind for my dress, but it is just a little bit short. It's fine as long as I'm not on my feet for too long."
5,Goosebumps all over!,"Bobby Fisher is not only a technically adept musician, but he is a consumate performer, writer, and composer. His grasp of liturgical music leaves me with goosebumps every time I hear his music."
4,Great Reference Book,"This is a compact, no frills reference book that we use all the time. The perfect reference for New England."
3,"Okay, but","This LaCie 40 gigabyte external hard drive plugs into any computer with a USB2 plug and comes with a Linux Mandriva desktop system installed. It's a nifty idea if you don't want to be bothered installing the program yourself. You can take the drive, plug it into any computer and have your Mandriva Linux desktop system with you, at home or away.But in truth, you are better off buying a LaCie 40 GB external hard drive without Mandriva installed. The stand-alone drive is cheaper. You can then download the 2006 Mandriva program onto this drive for free, and have the same system, for less. I recommend the second method for all but the complete techno-idiot.Mandriva is easy to install. After you select the language in which you want to run, the program pretty much installs itself."
2,a short story in book length,"It seems that Amazon rankings work like this: fiction - mostly people that like the book; non-fiction - mostly people that didn't like the book; music - people calling each other names.So to buck the trend - here are my two stars. I really like Greg Bear, especially his ""Blood Music"". This book, however, has a clever premise and some decent hard science to it, but on the whole is just plain boring. It may have made a nice short story or novella, but it doesn't work at novel length.The initial find of the iceman is too bizarrely coincidental with the rest of the story. And, anyway, wasn't this same ground better covered by Arthur C. Clarke's 2001?Bear is one of the few authors I will risk a sight-unseen hardback purchase. After this disappointment, I may have to remove him from that category. That's evolution for you!"
2,couldn't get through it...,"I'm sorry. I usually like Greg Bear, really enjoyed Eon, and looked forward to this, but this book was obviously intended to be a ""product"" as much as a novel. It's inflated with needless chit-chat, dull description and flat characters who really have little to do with the main storyline.I tried to be patient...but he lost me at page 100. (I'm glad I took this one out of the library and didn't spring for it.)"
2,Not Greg Bear's best!,"Writing as a fan of Greg Bear and many of his previous books, I have to say that this is not one of his best. The premise of an evolutionarily important retrovirus embedded in our genes that drives a sort of punctutated evolution is interesting, but Bear does not pull it off. His book struggles as an unsuccessful mix of a hard science fiction story about a possible new revelation in biology and a story of a relationship between two of the principal characters in the plot. Furthermore, the decidedly anticlimactic ending left me cold, with only a superficial description of the supposed next stage in human evolution, which didn't even seem that remarkable given the long build-up. Disappointing."
4,"Good read, a little bit manipulative","The story has been done before in science fiction-- what sparks evolution? and what happens to us if a jump begins in our lifetime? Bear uses the characters of a biologist coming off a failed marriage, a disgraced paleontologist, and a government disease specialist to carry the plot that is meant to be an answer to this 'what if'.The approach is fresh, and well-written. My sole complaint was that I felt like he chose a very ""good scientist/bad scientist"" approach to members of the government and scientific communities and created an artificial kind of opposition that may have made us like his characters better but weakened the lovely complexity that he'd otherwise achieved. I think he could have respected his readers enough to let us make our own judgements without painting the character actions in such big obvious strokes. It's a common failing, but Bear's a good enough writer that seeing it here disappointed me."
4,Great sc-fi mystery book . . . sequel forthcoming!,"Awesome concept and great storytelling! I read it straight through in 1 day! (It reminded me a little of X-files and Virus.) I only gave it 4 stars, because 5 stars are reserved for books I want to keep forever. This doesn't mean that everyone shouldn't read it!!! ;-) P.S. According to a recent interview, the author said that #2, ""Darwin's Children"" is indeed forthcoming . . . YIPEE!!! :-)"
3,Thick rambling book containing thin gripping book,"There are subplots all over the place, but the main stream is this: Something in human DNA is evolving within a generation and changing not only the offspring but the parents. That part is fascinating and the science is crackling. Alas, some of the subplots have dangling ends and sloppy thinking. An example: One main character's husband apparently suicides, disappearing on a small boat. A few pages later she says that his body was found and it was in such bad shape ""they identified him by his wedding band."" Whoa! If you want a character like that to be really dead, you ID him by his dental charts. So the reader keeps waiting for the husband's reappearance. He stays gone. In the last 50 or so pages, the book goes magical after the birth of the evolution-jumped baby, who can speak from birth. She's fascinating, but the book too soon cuts away to an end that semaphores ""wait for the sequel."" Not a bad idea."
3,calling all genetic engineers,"cool book, great idea. But im not a genetic engineer, nor a biologist, and to tell the truth, the jargon gets a bit too confusing. After a while, I just dindt care anymore about LPC's or HERVs or retrowhatevers, I did not get any of it. It makes an interesting story, thats why i stuck with it to the end. And I guess the jargon doenst really matter to make a good storyline, though it can be important for the nitpickers. I enjoyed it, but next time, please less technobabble."
3,Hard Science- Tough Read,"Hard science-fiction alows us to learn while we enjoy a good story. The science is here,the makings of a good story also. But the book never takes hold of the reader, never pulls one along for the ride. I learned about phages, retrovirus and genetics, but didn't have a lot of fun."
4,This Book Rocks,I have to disagree with the negative critiques. This book was great. I really enjoyed it and it was so much more interesting than any of the medical thrillers out there. Very thought-provoking!
3,a little too technical,"I enjoyed this book overall, but Mr.Bear (doesn't that sound like a kid's toy?)went into way too much detail about the chemical bonds, and the virus, retrovirus, endovirus thing. The book gets much more interesting when he lays off the technobabble and concentrates more on the characters. The only other complaint I have is that he often has the characters refer to events that the reader knows nothing about, or he only alludes to an event, and we're left wondering ""What's up with that?""Overall, a good read, if you can stick it out through the science parts."
2,Darwins Radio had too much static,"Greg Bear is one of the best and most talented science fiction writers of today, but I guess even the greats bomb out occasionally.The concept behind the book is clever and thought provoking. The author thoroughly did his homework. The problem was in the writing. The book was so filled with distracting drivel and unnecessary social dialog that it could have been written by a computer. I felt embarrassment for the author when I read the first sentence -->""The flat afternoon sky spread over the black and gray mountains like a stage backdrop, the color of a dog's pale crazy eye."" The book reminds me of the movie Stargate; so much unrealized potential.Darwin's Radio wasn't all bad. I gave it two stars. After the the story begins, on page 493, the reader sees the real talent that Mr. Bear was hiding. By skimming over the superfluous dialogs, the reader is introduced to an eye opening view of a bright future."
5,A book that causes you to question things...,"What sets this wonderful book apart from others of the genre more than any other factor is the fact that it carefully explores the social implications, even the long-term ones, of a biological crisis. I look forward with high anticipation to other titles by this author."
3,Silly plot,GB really went out of his way to think up such a far fetched and unrealistic plot as this! Fortunately it's a brisk read.
3,Sags in the middle before an obvious conclusion,"This book had an interesting premise and some okay characters, but it ended up being a bit of a slog. The technical discussion is worth sitting through even for the non-scientist, but what is unforgivable is the number of boring conferences and meetings that populate this novel. In real life there is entirely too much of who said what about whom at the big conference, or jockeying for position at meetings -- we read escape fiction to get away from this stuff. Things picked up a bit again toward the end, but the conclusion was fairly obvious. There was also a small but bothersome plot hole which I won't describe for fear of giving away the ending, and the heroine's husband is conveniently dispensed with so early in the novel that one wonders why he existed in the first place. Greg Bear on a bad day is still better than many sci-fi writers on a good day, but this was not one of his better days."
2,Toooooooo loooooooooooooong,"Way too long. The story Bear tells is just not worth telling at such great length. It starts out as a scientific mystery and devolves into a soap opera. I never liked any of the characters enough to want to spend so much time with them. I only finished the book because I wanted to learn the answer to the evolutionary mystery, but the payoff was disappointing."
3,"Great premise, left me wanting for more...","My only complaint about this otherwise good hard sci-fi is that it ended too soon - why didn't we get to the good part about what these new people are going to be like? I felt like I waited the whole book for the 'good part' only to have that be a total of about 3 pages. It's too bad, because with just even one more chapter it could have been outstanding.I don't agree that this is Bear's best. While he is certainly getting better I felt that the Eon and Anvil of Stars were much better books. If you are looking for another book like those 2 you are going to be dissapointed by this one.Maybe there's going to be a sequel and I'll finally get my wishes..."
2,Wasted a great theme!,"I had never read Greg Bear before. So I was excited and ready for the experience of this writer and, it started out fine. However once he got into the characters it began to fall apart. Especially the diolog between Mitch and Kay was very amateurish. Conversations between the scientists were not realistic. At the top of all this the turn of the events and the agenda (far from science) that the author was trying to sneak in became obvious. What could be an exciting page turner evolved into a ""can't wait to finish"" kind of a nuisance. Although it was not waste of my time, it was the waste of an excellent theme by the author. A very interesting subject was being squandered by bad writing and shaky science."
3,Review of Darwin's Radio,"This book was a good book. What did I like about it? I liked the idea of something living inside of us for so long. About how life can change in an instant due to factors that we cannot control. I also like the deep, complicated science part of it. Although, for me, at times it got too complicated. The science talk would slow down the book some but it did add to the book an air of understanding."
3,"Great opening, too technical middle, interesting conclusion","The first chapter really hooked me, and the following early chapters kept me going, but then I felt buried in all the biological details. I kept plodding through anyway, and as the ending became more involved with the individual character's fates, my interest level picked up again.The concept is great, and the general plot, though somewhat predictable, makes it worth plodding through. The concept of a retrovirus which causes miscarriage and a second pregnancy with a poor infant survival rate is chilling. And this novel would have been much more of a thriller if we had been spared such thorough biological speculation.However, the sequel was, in my humble opinion, quite a bit more readable and worth reading, so for that reason, I do recommend reading this one first."
4,Good science,I really liked the science in this book. Not many science fiction novels handle biochemistry and genetics well but this one did. I was less impressed with the anthropology and did not really get how the ice man fit in. His discovery seemed like such a coincidence with the rest of the story. The characters were simple but entertaining. I enjoyed this book and would recommend it.
2,Mostly mediocre,"Takes exciting scary ideas that you COULD fall in love with, and buries them in a long boring, punctuated, slog of paper-mache characters who are either moping or expounding like they're on AM talk radio. I got tired of the author's descriptions of white middle-class America flaking out. I finished it so I could trash it. Sorry it was such a failure."
2,Boooooooring,"Very talky, slow-moving and WAY too long. The central idea is interesting but not enough to carry a 500+ page book. Much of the action, such as it is, takes place ""off-camera"", being reported by characters or summarized briefly instead of being depicted. The collapse of society amidst paranoia about an unknown disease could have made for a gripping thriller but instead it is treated as incidental. The characters are a bit better realized than in some of Bear's previous novels though not by much. On the other hand the flow of thought-provoking ideas which made many of his earlier novels enjoyable seems to have dried up here. Very disappointing."
2,Not one of his best.,"Do you remember those really old sf stories where men in white coats endlessly lecture each other about the improbable results of their peculiar experiments? Large indigestible helpings of pseudo-scientific guff, but not much else?This is one of those."
2,"Good concept, but writing cannot sustain it.","To put it bluntly, Greg Bear's limitations as a writer hinder this book. If he had cut it down by 100-150 pages, it would've been a focused and thrilling novel. As it stands, the book meanders. The paeans to Democrats and villification of Republicans do not mesh with the theme. The idea behind the book is gripping enough that I finished it, but more from the standpoint of wanting to find out how it ended. If there would've been a two page summary, I would've probably preferred it to the last portion."
2,Starts off like a rocket. Finishes like a cannonball.,"Darwin's Radio is the great sci-fi/techno-thriller you always wanted to read -- up to about 2/3 into the book. The at first seemingly complex story is actually a well-tied together tight ball of story lines. Especially if you've kept up on virus-related science and fiction, this is no stretch of the imagination, rather an original innovation. And, where other fiction fails, namely believability of characters and their thoughts and actions, this book succeeds. However, sometimes great writers don't know when to stop -- as in, just end the book with a punch! It occurs to me now that, like Ender's Game, Darwin's Radio could have been two very good, but very different kinds of books. It's too late for that now, but you may want to consider that in your aproach to reading it -- avoid the dissapointment by lowering expectations a few notches."
2,"100% plot, no characterization","If you enjoy books where the virus is the most rounded and interesting character, or think people actually speak dialogue like ""We can't target the LPC messenger RNA in the cytoplasm because our current ribozymes do not recognize the mutated form,"" (I am not making this up; see p. 268), or enjoy books with 5-page glossaries of scientific terms at the end, this book's for you. The human characters are motiveless, flat, dull, boring, etc. and are just moved on- and off-stage by the author to speak this sort of scientific babble. Snickers at religious people and politicians. The plot is kind of interesting but could have been written on a 3 x 5 card. Not recommended unless you go in for this sort of thing; I do enjoy an occasional science fiction story but not this one."
2,Techno Thriller Without End,"I ""read"" this on a drive from Washington, DC to Detroit, MI and back. (At 15 packed CDs, not much time left to hear anything else, believe me!) Mr. Guidall does everything he can to make this book come to life. He's a real pro. But something this long should have had some kind of point to it, or at least an interesting ending. There's lots of biological and genetic techno talk that you won't need to understand, and weaved around that a pretty pedestrian plot, full of give-aways ‚Äì Bear stealing his own thunder (you as a reader are way ahead of the characters most of the time, which is absurd and makes you feel silly). By doing childbirth, perhaps Bear decided to go for both the largely male techno audience and the romance ... audience simultaneously. Who knows? Who cares? Oh, and did I mention it was unconscionably long? If you insist on experiencing this novel, may I recommend it in an abridged form? You won't miss a thing."
3,Super Reader,"The earlier part of the book is the most interesting, with the investigation, and the parts in Georgia, and phage science, among other things.Interesting, but not outstanding. The latter new child family oriented stuff drags a bit. The relationship and actions between the two main adult characters and parents doesn't necessarily ring true either, I think."
3,An average book,"I've read Bear's books before (Eon, Heritage) and although I was never quite satisfied with them, they held some promise. Seeing how a lot of people think ""Darwin's Radio"" is one of his finest, I decided to give it a try.I stick to the same verdict. Quite promising, but disappointing. Characters are flat, plot is over-stretched.The only good part about the book is the basic science of endogenous retroviruses. Bear did his research and it shows. He can also explain it in terms that are understandable to general public. Yet he fails where it matters most - in justifying the reasons and mechanisms for quick evolutionary change. From his descriptions it seems that he lacks even basic understanding of how evolution works. And since the whole book is dedicated to the idea of rapid evolutionary jumps, the book falls flat and all that research is wasted. Without the science this book has nothing to offer."
3,"Good science, not so good story telling","Bear does good homework with the science part, but misses the ball on the fiction part. The accounts of the inner workings of genetics, molecular biology and evolutionary biology begin to get in the way of telling a story and making us care about the central characters in the novel. I like Bear and read through this book rather quickly, because I did find it entertaining. But he needed to spend a bit more time crafting a story and a little less on the wonkery of the biological sciences. I felt as if I needed a stack of reference works in the field to keep up. I found myself either ignoring some deep science parts or refering back to the included glossary of scientific terms. I enjoy reading a novel more without drowing in a sea of acronyms."
3,Good middle third of a book,"Darwin's Radio is a solid middle third of a book. Acutely drawn characters with realistic interactions, flashes of heroism, and aching humanism (I especially liked Saul); well-plotted storyline; provocative scientific ideas; frustratingly realistic politics of Big Science. What's missing is some development of the initial trigger for the events of the book - author Greg Bear alludes to ""stresses"" and chemical communication, but I couldn't figure out why all this would be happening. A second missing element relates to the first: why are Stella Nova and the other 100,000 better than their parents?Read Darwin's Radio for a fast-paced and frighteningly plausible story of the ""How"" of modern science and politics, but be prepared to speculate on the ""Why"" of it all."
2,Really Bad Science,"I normally enjoy Bear's work, but I was dissapointed in Darwin's Radio. Though his character development and writing style are good (if a little longwinded), his use of evolutionary biology is not. He obviously did a great deal of research into molecular biology and immunology and I am surprised that he didn't work harder to achieve a better understanding of evolution. The idea's presented as ""tomorrow's headlines"" are not just silly, they're pretty much impossible. Speciation is not a mystery and Bear's use of goal directed evolution is completely at odd's with real science. He throws in terms like punctuated equilibrium and adaptationism, but I don't think he really understands them. Read the book if you want but keep in mind it has a lot more in common with fantasy than sci-fi."
1,Terrible,"I find it difficult to believe that this and similar horror / thriller stuff was written by the same Greg Bear who authored Eon, Eternity, and Anvil of Stars.All I can figure is he's reached a life stage where he feels a need for mass audience and especially a movie contract or two. The poetic justice is this: beyond the gross-out factor his writing is now just plain bad. Maybe that's part of the recipe for this market."
2,Poor story line,"I'm going to keep this review short. Just wanted to give a rating so that system is fair, meaning the ratings are not filled with all 5 star people telling you to buy it.The book meanders through needless details that do not contribute anything to the story. Main characters husband commits suicide, big deal. They find neanderthals with speciation, big deal.Read Eon by Bear, it is much better and more imaginative."
1,Disappointing,"When a book is really, really, really bad I throw it across the room. This book took its maiden flight at 11:00pm on a Saturday night on around page 85. I am going to give this book to my brother Lonnie because he keeps giving me horrible books. If he reads this...great - He will save himself from wasting a few hours. If he doesn't - I figure I owe him anyway."
2,Wildly Disjointed (small spoiler warning),"I got this book out of a suggestion from a friend. I started reading it and I loved it, but this book as a whole is highly disjointed, and about 3/4 into the novel it starts making no sense. It's like the story just gets lost and it ends abruptly, then Bear just started typing randomly with no ideas of where the story is going. There was no climax, and the structure seemed to get lost. I give this book 2 stars because the beginning was fascinating as was the whole first half, but the second Kaye and Mitch get together the book takes a slow and tedious dive into obscurity. My recommendation: don't get the book. It's a fascinating premise, and at first you'll be riveted by the interesting characters and storyline, but everything that's good about the novel gets lost in the last 2/3rds of the book"
1,Mitch killed this book,"I love books that run with the concept of ancient diseases wreaking havoc on modern man. What killed this book, was the anthropologist, Mitch. He was an obnoxious twit with overly flexible morals, which truly took away from the integrity of the story."
3,greg you let me down,"DARWIN' RADIO starts promising with lots of what appears to be solid scientific reasoning.I can remember my high school English teacher drilling ""write what you know"" in to our heads. I can tell from the text you enjoyed becoming a father and you love the mother of of your child. But come on. Born speaking English? Really? The book for went from sci ti to sci stupid in the last few chapters."
4,Shaky ending,"""Darwin's Radio"" grips you from the start and holds on until an unfortunately anticlimatic conclusion. The characters are well drawn and diverse, and the plot moves along at a brisk pace. The evolutionary science that serves as the premise of the novel is speculative, but not beyond the realm of belief. Furthermore, it serves to make the book one of the more original I have encountered.However, as I mentioned, the ending is something of a let down. It is overly rushed, and doesn't really offer anything in the way of resolution. That said, this is still and enjoyable piece of hard SF. With a better ending I would have given it five stars, but it is still well worth reading."
3,Fails to Reach Orbit,"Bear is a good science fiction author, and you will rarely be disappointed with picking up anything he's written. Even when they are incomplete novels like ""Darwin's Radio"".The story is classic Bear, an education in the reading with great detail and good (if slightly too masculine) characterization . Unfortuately, this story just peters-out in the last 75 pages, characters are left hanging along with plotlines, a huge conspiracy remains, and the relationship between the old and new races sputters to a conclusion in an unsatisfactory Epilogue.Perhaps Bear wants to write a sequel?"
2,Darwin's Dumb Radio,"The preposterous plot barely keeps the reader hanging on long enough to finish this book. Save your money and your time - there are much better books out there that prompt one to think about the earth, our role on it and the future of our species."
3,Great 1st half...what happened?,"This book started with a truly mind bending, mind blowing first half. A horrifying, plausible disease is loose, and our characters have to stop it. Great so far. Lots of nifty science that I swallowed like a good reader. Then, Bear turns the story into a romance. Our main characters are in love and ON THE RUN! Oh, boy. That's when it lost me. Just keep with the mystery and the disease, and it's a winner. Can he go back and start over from page 350?"
2,Great disappointment,"Lost opportunities, that's what I say about this work by Greg, who used to be my favourite author. I used to buy his works on strength that HE wrote it - but I was disappointed this time. Greg has come down a long way since his own nadir of accomplishment in Eon/Eternity days. Here he wants to do a Arthur C Clarke style 'END OF MANKIND as we know it' gambit a la The End of Childhood meets Andromeda Strain, but fails from mishandling of dramatic tension and plot development. His premises are technically brilliant - human evolution encoded into our genes and suddenly progressing explosively. But the reader will be let down by the last 50 pages. The climatic scene is simply not there. No buzz, no high, no intellectual orgasm. Just a bewilderment that ""Hey is this IT?"""
2,Predictability,"Oh well, in reading some of the other reviews stating that this book was way too technical for the layman, I can tell you that it's way too predictable for someone with the relevant technical knowledge. I knew what was going on from the time that the bodies were discovered in that cave, and that was very early in the book. The book took no surprising turns and the main protagonist was insufferable. Although I have greatly enjoyed some of Bear's other works such as Blood Music, I can't say I enjoyed this one much."
3,Great concept woven into a disappointing story.....,"This is the first Greg Bear book I've read and I'll probably read more. I thought his premise was very interesting - evolution occurring as a ""flash cut"" rather than gradually. However, I found the story quite disappointing. I agree with the previous review that a sequel is in order. Numerous characters were introduced throughout the story. We began to care about them only to have them simply disappear from the book without further word.I also think many of the plot lines could have been better developed. All the important events just seemed to be very convenient and very unprobable coincidents. This a really a shame since it could have been so much more."
3,"Good, but muddy going.","As the other reviewers have mentioned, the book has a sigificant amount of technical jargon, most of which I was able to gloss by without resorting to the glossary of terms. I found the story interesting, but the end left me wanting. The story certainly reminds me of Bear's other work ""Blood Music"", which in my opinion was much better. I would start with it first."
3,Darwin's Radio - metaphor gone awry!,"This is a fast-paced adventure in ideas, genetics & evolution. As the clues & scenes unfold, the idea that we are not the unchanging acme of our species becomes more & more apparent. While scientists bicker, citizens riot & politicians placate, there are groups of scientists scrambling for answers in their labs, doctors wrestling with mass miscarriages & bureaucrats intentionally bungling data. In other words, all hell is breaking loose. Some of this latest Greg Bear saga is eminently readable, flowing & fluent, as is this author's trademark; some of it reads like an abbreviated Genetics for Dummies. I managed to stay the course."
2,Just plain bad writing,"Like another reviewer, I didn't get very far into this book before giving up on it (though I didn't actually throw it across the room). It wasn't just that it was boring and long-winded, it was simply that Mr. Bear is a bad writer. Cliches abound. He seems to enjoy using colors to describe everything! ""The gray xyz was next to a white abc which had a blue-green exterior and a pinkish lid, etc, etc."" The romance between the characters is like something you'd read in a crappy romance novel ""she stood above the ridge looking strong. Noble. Gorgeous."" Ugh!"
3,More of a slog than I thought it would be,"I purchased this book based upon the mainly enthusiastic reviews here and elsewhere.I was disappointed to discover that the story was more of a slog than I anticipated, and it was a bit of a struggle to finish it.Elsewhere here, the plot is discussed, and I won't waste an effort to restate that. I'll just say that once the heroine was seriously involved in the process, it seemed to just take forever for the final scenes to work themselves out.I also had real problems with the realization of the main idea here. It just didn't seem logical to me. Yeah, I know that evolution can occur, even in humans, in this late day, but this just didn't seem to be high on the list of probable evolutionary changes."
2,No exciting music playing on this radio,"Well, what an absolute disappointment! I have read several of Bear's books, and I thought this one might follow suit with excitement, intrigue, suspense, scary critters...SORRY! None of those!I tried really hard to wade through this mishmash of oddly developed characters, a totally unecessary and weak romance between the two primary characters, and a plot that could have been really good. Sadly more time was spent with the science of the theory than the fruition of the theory, resulting in an oddly confused mess that I couldn't even finish.In conclusion I just can't recommend this read if one is searching for that perfect beach book! It just isn't all that exciting! Of course if you need help sleeping...:-)"
2,"A nice idea, but then it just rambles ...","RE: my review of EON - the characters get away from him here & all blend together, ruining what could have been a biological manifesto."
3,"Not bad, not great","I must say that Bear's Darwin's Radio rather impresses me. He knows his science, or at least makes it sound like he does. This book is packed with DNA terminology and evolutionary concepts that make a dumb guy like me think he's pretty knowledgeable. Moreover, I really like the plot, and the concept that humans are entering some form of ""upgrade"".However, there is something frustrating about the book, some aspect of it that makes it seem plodding and slow. At moments that are supposed to be times when the reader's ""thrill level"" should be peaked, it is only mildly provoked. Bear dances around what this whole virus/SHEVA thing is without really hitting on it for way too long. As much as I liked the book, it was easy for me to become distracted by other books and as a result it took a while to get it finished fast enough.I would not classify this as a cheap sci-fi thriller. Its well written, but just not enough to grab me the way I think Bear intended."
2,"Promising start, lousy finish","This was my first experience with the author, and I was especially intrigued by the blurb. But what started out as a scientific fiction page turner of high merit later turned into a rather unsuspenseful and unbelievable (even taking into account the ""suspension of disbelief"" factor). This became more problematic as the author switched from a rather strong scientific premise to a character-driven drama driven by characters that lacked depth and really weren't all that interesting anyway.The plot turns also veered off the original trajectory and left me scratching my head why Bear had gone from rather complex and gripping to formulaic. Only the strong beginning kept me from abandoning this book toward the end."
4,More Great Bear,"I think I used the above words when I finished Moving Mars; they about sum it up. I thought Darwins Radio was a little slower paced than some of Bear's other offerings, perhaps necessarily so to provide the biological foundation, but as usual the last 200 pages just rocketed by. I find it amazing that Bear is comfortable working with the physical sciences (Moving Mars), nano-tech/computer tech (Queen of Angels/Slant), and in this case, the biological sciences. Yet in all genres, devise exciting and credible plots and develop characters that we care about.The ending was perfect--not a cliffhanger screaming necessary sequal, but something that can stand alone or be continued--I vote the latter. I really like the new variety of human and want to read more about them. I think this is the primary reason I'm taking the time to write these comments. How about ""SHEVAs Children"" for next year..."
4,Technobabble Really?,"I read it with interest and found to be quite a quick read for the most part. I have one dissenting opinion: I found the biology to be a bit of a tough go but, I WANTED MORE NOT LESS. I'm not saying that I understood it all and it took awhile to sink in but the reading and thinking about the biological content was worth the effort. Evolution is fascinating & this work took me well beyond my previous thinking. I had the usual model plus a crude ""catastrophe"" model of evolution. This new line of thinking of ""punctuated"" evolution is very tasty indeed. Thanks for that.I would suggest that the author perhaps put up a website to go witht he book where lay readers could get more science if they they are so inclined."
2,Find another station,"I've read both Darwin's Radio and its successor, Darwin's Children. The real star of the show here is the evolutionary change itself. Bear's 2D characters drag both books down. Unfortunate, because this would make for a great SF read if the characters weren't so single-minded & cardboardlike."
1,Pretentious,"Why is this book so badly written ? The first sentence is ""The flat afternoon sky spread over the black and gray mountains like a stage backdrop, the color of a dog's pale crazy eye"" and there are many more awful sentences like this one. After 20 pages I nearly threw the book away. I then started to skip pages. From about page 80 on I read the book and tried to ignore the misguided ""poetic"" stuff, which - mercifully - became less frequent. This would have been a good hard SF story of about 300 pages. Unfortunately the book has 538 pages. A good publisher employs people who guide authors (they are called lectors). Somebody should have told Mr. Bear to cut the unsuccessful attempts at writing ""literature"". They ruined the book."
1,Horrible waste of time.,"There's an intersing story idea here but I'm 200 pages in and nothing has happened.....Greg, get an editor and move the story along! Jeeze, what a waste of time. I'm throwing this one in the trash and the sequel (Children) without even attempting it. (Maybe some talented your author out there can take a stab at re-writing this book?)"
3,"A Good read, but not spectaculer.","This book have a interesting premise, and interesting characters. The story revolves around a cellular presence named SHEVA and how its discovery and spread could change the evolutionary history of human kind. The main characters of the book are all very well developed and draws you to their emotional and physical crisis. The problem with this book is that it feels ""lose"" and the plot disconnect itself during the middle of the book. The ending is not exactly a satisfying closure but acceptable. I felt like this is one of the few Sci-Fi books that I am more focus on the characters than the dangerous setting."
5,"Very nice combination of biology, politics and humanity","The ideas presented in this book are simply mind-blowing. It offers a very provocative explanation of the punctuated equilibrium theory of evolution. To fully appreciate everything presented in this book, it helps to have at least a basic biology background. The book also explores the politics involved in the biotech industry and what the personal motives of a select few can do to the policies and practices of an entire nation. I love how the book doesn't only focus on the biology but chooses to display all of its ideas through the characters. The characters could have been better developed but the main point of this book is the idea of evolution. The characters are simply a means to display greg bear's idea. They're sort of like a real-world example of sorts. So maybe it's fitting that the characters are somewhat flat. Read this book if you're at all interested in evolution."
1,Where's the Beef?,"This book *did* take a lot to get going. It was exciting in the middle, yet I felt the ending left the reader somewhat lacking closure. It almost feels as if a door has been left open for a sequel. Hopefully, the author will resist the urge."
1,Very disappointing,"A solid idea with no meat to fill out the 500 pages. The entire plot becomes blatantly obvious early on in the book, and the journey of fulfilling that plot was far from entertaining. What a bore."
3,"Almost, but not quite","This book came well recommended and I really wanted to enjoy it. Unfortunately, Bear only realized about 75% of what he could have with this book. The idea of an evolutionary virus was fantastic, and Bear started out strong with the social impact of SHEVA. But toward the end, I thought he got kind of lazy. I wanted a really strong, revolutionary conclusion, but it just seemed to peter out. I lost my sympathy toward the main characters toward the end. It was a good book, but I wish I'd waited for the paperback."
2,Great premise but..,the book does not live up to its potential. The ending will leave you completely unsatisfied.Move along. This isn't the book you were looking for.
1,"""Darwin's Radio"" is a bit antiquated.","This story blows.It's quite mediocre in the extreme. And it's word count could and should have been cut by at least eighty percent.DR runs through the usual paces that a medical thriller runs through: the dull fright, the plethora of technobabble, the cliche persecutions, the plethora of technobabble, the internecine battles with stupid bureaucrats, the plethora of technobabble, and the extremely boring finale. And, finally, the plethora of technobabble.I saw no new moves to this tale at all. In Addition, The ending was extremely anticlimactic and silly. What is this with the evolved kiddies expressing parrotlike behavior and the color changing cheeks of both parents and child? I thought I'd been thrust into another dull and crusty episode of Wild Kingdom for a moment.*yawn*Give these evolved characters each a cracker and shut them up."
5,The best for spiders,"Found this stuff at Lowe's. Been using for two years. Very reasonable price. At First was skeptical but this stuff does the job! I have spiders everywhere almost all year around and this stuff does what it says. I spray when and where I don't see spiders and then when one comes along to build its condo in the corner or anywhere, I just watch it die. They had to walk through where I sprayed so it does it's thing while the spider keeps truckin' to its spot! But i did have a big mother in my tub the other day with and it was unusually large. I saw it was ready to have babies too!. Just a little spray and that was that! The spray takes longer to kill the big thick looking spiders that are normally outside in the hedges. I get those occasionally on the patio after trimming. Terro Spider Killer takes care of the other bugs too that can be menacing like silver fish. But I won't buy here because the shipping is way too much!"
3,Kills spiders...but takes longer than I'd like,"Product works well in the sense that every spider I've shot with it dies. The problem is they seem to crawl around a bit before dying. I used to have a spider spray that would kill all insects including spiders instantly. Can't seem to find it anymore, but it's NOT this one."
1,Ever sleep on a moonbounce ?,This bed is really uncomfortable and causes restless nights. If you move it goes bouncing around .I woke after a few hours with severe back pain.It also needs air added every night and the pump is loud and stinks. The only good thing is it is fun to jump on and has a lot of bounce for other activities.
3,Those Moaning Saxophones,"The Six Brown Bothers present a whole range of saxophones, allowing the listener to hear something rarely heard these days -- the bass saxophone.The quality is good keeping in mind these are remastered 78s."
3,Ahh...the memories.,"I remember seeing this movie back when I was in college. My best friend dragged me to the theater to see what he called a good science fiction movie. To my surprise, it was a combination of martial arts and science fiction. I loved it. I have seen it on my satellite service once or twice over the years, but I decided to own it. I have to say the movie content was still as good as I remember, but the presentation or DVD transfer was not. I guess the manufacturer did not have much to work with due to age, and this was the best they could do. The movie is ""campy"", dated and utterly ridiculous by any standard, but fun. I just wish it looked better. In any case, I can live with it, I'm a fan. If you remember this one, you will live with it too."
3,recording quality not great,I bough inframan and super inframan (shaw brothers).They are the same film but the shaw brothers reproduction was far superior and actually looked like a normal movie and not a copy from a vhs.
5,"hot,hot and hot the band is on fire love them!!!wow!wow!wow!",this is a great album i mean great love it .It rocks!!love i
4,all wound up vs. self-titled,"all wound up was the godsmack-released version of the self-titled album. it is the same album except for the song order and the song ""whatever"" is not on all wound up."
4,A great read,"I've known the author only for his culinary talents and organizational ability. Therefore, it was quite a surprise when he announced the publication of his novel, All' Acqua. I bought several books for family and friends. Skeptical at first, naturally, I began quickly to appreciate the author's writing style, and his ability of keeping the novel interesting and fluent. From the start, I fell in love with the story's main characters: Herman Schuller, the young Swiss Army corporal, and Angelina Bianci, the fashion model from Milan. But I was not prepared for the last dozen or so pages, which took me by surprise, totally - the best writing comes at the very end. And what an ending it is...."
3,Disgruntled,"!st off, the graphics are alright. I do like the unique battle advantage scenarios that are taken into account based on number of troops, type, experience, etc. etc. However the flaw that ticks me off is this. No matter the scenario, (ex. 5 troops vs. 2) the computer always does maximum damage while you (the player) always do minimum damage. The odds could be overwhelming in your favor, and the computer would still win. Aside from that the game was alright."
2,NOT WHAT IT PRETENDS TO BE!,The sketchy sales information on the Amazon site leads one to believe that these are original recordings. Not so! What follows is an OK but not great rehash of too many songs by a group of unknowns. Be forwarned.
1,So much talent so badly recorded!,The sound is badly recorded. The performers are so great that the bad audio recording seems all the more unacceptable. You sit there knowing that this is a great performance and you only feel anguish in not being able to hear it properly.
2,It's pretty but cheap looking.,"After about a month it also broke off my phone. Actually, when it came to me it was already broken and I had to push the string part back into the metal part. I didn't want to go through the hassle of returning it though so I just fixed it. Not worth the price in my opinion."
1,Junk :-(,"If I could give this zero stars I would. One of these trays just broke in my hands while I was trying to break up the ice cubes. I only owned it for about three weeks. But then, the plastic did feel rather stiff and cheap. I have never in my life seen this happen with an ice tray.I was really disappointed in this item, because it is such a great idea! And I have a smaller-than-average freezer--space is at a premium.Back to the store it goes."
3,"OK, but not ""scariest game ever""",I bought this game years ago. It's OK for a 20 minute span of distraction every now and then. It's definitely a bargain bin CD though. To compare it to games like Silent Hill isn't valid. There's no plot or atmosphere other than you being a diver in the water and waiting for the heart beat sounds to get louder so you know when to start looking. The only real scary part is not knowing where it will be. But the graphics are so limited it doen't provide real animation that makes you believe it;'s a shark attacking. It's OK. But only as a cheap extra game to have around.
5,"Great game, very captivating","If you have an interest in sharks and/or diving, this is a great game. Other reviews go into detail on the actual dives so I won't bother with that aspect. At the start of each dive mission my heart rate starts to increase, so when a shark approaches and you begin to hear a heartbeat on the computer it can make you jump. The clarity of the water is realistic so that you may be warned that a shark is near but can't see it yet. Very realistic and great graphics. Short missions make it ideal for someone who doesn't want to spend all night on the computer. Additionally, at the harder levels, those short missions become longer when you get eaten and have to try over and over again."
2,Disappointing,"""Uncorked"" is one of my favorite movies. I was hoping for much from Far Harbor, but the plot was dull and flat. The crisis facing the characters came across as ridiculous. The wealthy setting only added to the impression. If we were supposed to feel compassion, I sadly felt only ridicule."
3,Slow but worthy ensemble comedy/drama,"This movie's script and situations break no new ground, and the camera work is standard fare. The main reason to see the movie is the performances. A group of unknown actors bring out the best in one another's abilities. A few exchanges between them seem forced (there is a gay subplot which just does not work), and the characters spend too much of their time sniping at each other to be truly likeable. Still, the movie showcases the aimlessness of many people I know in their late twenties/early thirties; you may feel that you are watching your friends on film."
1,Only 4 more DVDs then the world will be safe!!,"As I'm writing this, it says ""only 4 left in stock"", after some poor souls buy those last four, this DVD sould be outlawed! I got it because I'm a big fan of Jennifer and I knew she was brilliant in her early work. This was not an exception, as far as Jennifer is concerned, she did some excellent acting, but this is about all there is. The film is so badly written, so boring, so pointless and so slow I wished I had longer hair so that I could have pulled it out. It is this bad.The transfer quality is cheapish and the sound no better. It does not have subtitles or extras or anything. Just an amateur looking menu leading to a crappy movie.This DVD is a great gift to one of your enemies or someone that you really want to take revenge on. Just tell them that it gets better near the end to guarantee they will suffer through the whole thing before they are hit with the end credits and be scarred for life!"
1,ZZZZZZZZZ..........,"It`s a little bit boring.... the only thing that save the movie is Jennifer Connelly... But the light, the script, the story ..Oh my God...It seems to me like a French movie .... Please Jennifer punch in the nose to your agent ! Carlos Gonzalez Fernandez"
4,"""Turn It On"".","This movie wasn't as good as ""True Romance"" or ""Natural Born Killers"", but the soundtrack sure is great. It's a good mix of cool bands (circa 1994), and legends like ""Roger Miller"" and ""Johnny Cash"". Everything here is actually good, but the better ones are from ""Flaming Lips"", ""Mazzy Star"", ""Reverend Horton Heat"", and ""Butthole Surfers"". ""Meat Puppets"" and ""Jesus And Mary Chain"" are great too though. Song for song it's one of the better alternative-heavy soundtracks I've seen. Hop in your car, put it in, and be ""King Of The Road""."
4,great cd great price good service,i found this cd here and i have wanted it for 15 years it was a great price and i had no problems with my service from these guys
2,"Silverware is 18/0, not 18/10","The silverware was good looking but I immediately returned it when I realized it was 18/0, not 18/10 as advertised. However, Amazon did a great job with the return and refund."
2,"Comfy, but problems ensue","Found these shoes very comfortable right out of the box, and they don't look like those ugly golf shoes you often see. Look and feel like tennis shoes. Good price. However, at the end of the first summer two of the spikes fell out, and not just the spikes but the part of the shoe that holds the spike in place. Didn't notice it until the next summer so too late to do anything about it."
4,really good compilation of SW tunes.,"this is a solid compilation of the 3 stealers wheel albums- it actually contains the first album in it's entirety.it's not perfect- gives some short shrift the the 2nd record, 'ferguslie park' (my favorite of the 3) by omitting 'good businessman'- but is a solid collection of the songs rafferty/egan created in the early 70s.music geeks: the first two records were produced by leiber & stoller and sound fantastic."
5,It just keeps coming,"I loved this book because(besides the new perspective) it gave the reader all the missing gaps from Ender's game. It told us what happened on Eros, the bickering between the higher-ups when it came to decided who would lead, and so much more. I highly recomend reading Ender's Game before-hand because Ender is the main part of the story, or read it soon after Shadow. This is a hreat book for all ages!"
5,Surprisingly good,"I usually like his novels, but was prepared for a somewhat boring novel since this was billed as ""parallel"" to Ender's Game. I was pleasantly surprised to find it as engrossing as the original."
4,Shadow of Substance,"Unfortunately, I cannot easily give Ender's Shadow that elusive fifth star. This is not any fault of Orson Scott Card's, however. This is a magnificent book, full of vivid description and a wonderfully woven story. My only regret is that my previous readings of Ender's Game (20 or so all told) colored my reading of Shadow. I cannot say I regret reading Ender's Game first, but at the same time, to read this book fresh, without the knowledge of the Ender story, would be magnificent indeed."
5,this book is the ultimate companion to enders game,"enders game has but one book which rivals in comparison, that book would be the recently written companion novel, enders shadow. bringing a new view to science fiction writing, orson scott card, has created another masterpiece in the saga which started with a youth named ender."
5,Increadibly wonderful! MUST READ!,"When I was walking down the hall of my local mall, and saw 'Ender's Shadow' in the window of the nearest book-store, I had to rush right in and buy it. I didn't even know OSC was coming out with another Ender book. I could not have made a better purchase. I devoured the book in less than a day, and loved every minute of it. I doesn't take anything away from the original as a few reviews here seem to say, in fact it added to it. Ender is still the true hero, but he had help. Even if Ender didn't know it, Bean was right there to help him do what he was born to do. If you haven't already bought this book, go right now and get it. If you haven't read the original 4 books, go out and buy all 5. Call in sick to work and read them all!!!"
5,Far superior to the Ender's Game Sequels,"Too many things I want to say... This is a very good book, almost as good as Ender's Game. It looks like Card must have struggled with how to make Bean stand as his own character without deprecating Enders legend as the only superchild. Overall, I think the results are quite good in that Bean struggles with a very different set of issues and limitations (I actually found Bean easier to relate to) from Ender while still fitting a similar profile.Argh - I could write for a long time, but the short answer is that this is well worth buying. Check Card's website to read the first few chapters if you are in doubt..."
3,Decent follow up.,"Ender's Game, while a limited work, really excited me when I read it the first time. It crackled with wonderful energy, and was driven by a clever plot. Now we return to this world from a different point of view, and while it was an entertaining book, I found it just falls a little flat."
5,Card at his best (and that's saying a lot!),"If you liked Ender's Game (a multi-award winner) you will devour Ender's Shadow! Like Card's best, it is a riviting psychological and philosophic tale, told through the medium of Sci Fi."
5,Disturbing,"I'll tell you why it was disturbing. When I read Ender's Game, I knew I'd never find another book of the same calibre, and as I went on to read the rest of the Ender Quartet, I realized Card was a master of his art.Then he wrote Ender's Shadow, which as others have stated gives Bean credit for several things we all took for granted were Enders brilliance. Reading these things, I got just a little annoyed, but I took a deep breath, settled back, and immersed myself into Bean's life.Perhaps in forcing myself to finish it, Card again enabled me to grow once more, and as I reread Ender's Shadow, I know it will take its place in my heart, right next to Ender's Game.Read it, Card again is golden."
4,Good addition to Ender's series,"I ordered ""Enders Shadow"" along with the controversial WWII novel ""Triumph and the Glory"" and enjoyed them both. I don't see what all the fuss is about. Geez!"
5,Almost as good as Ender's Game,"This is an excellent book! Finally, a book in the Ender's series that re-captures the magic and intensity of the first book. The three that came between Ender's Game and Ender's shadow are hollow and directionless compared to these two."
4,Just exactly what I expected it to be,"It is obvious that Ender's Shadow was written, if not completely, then partially to cash in on the success of Ender's Game. When I bought the book I expected it to be a very good book-since everything I've ever written by Orson Scott Card was very good-but not quite the quality of Ender's Game. This is exactly what I got. It seems to me that the things said about Bean, the main charectar in the novel, often work against the things said and implied in Ender's Game. But still, I loved the book. Basically, I recommend this book to fans of Ender's Game, but for new Card readers I advise you start with one of his better known works."
4,First class Card and a very good story!,"I am blessed with forgetfulness in my reading so that even though ""Ender's Game"" which I read long ago blew all of my fuses and became one of my most recommended and praised books, I retained just enough of the earlier story to have it add some real spice to this one.I must also say that even though I pretty well knew the expected ending to ""Ender's Shadow, I thoroughly enjoyed this parallel tale. Bean is a fascinating character in his own right, and it was a pleasure watching him almost grow up in this book.Card's gripping action and fine portrayals of all of his players always leaves me wanting more.If you haven't yet read ""Ender's Game"" (say what????), do yourself an immense favor and get it now! I would definitely read that one before this later work. If you have read it, I would strongly recommend ""Ender's Shadow"" as an excellent provoker of memories of that book, but also one that stands up strongly for itself."
5,Because he is an underdog,"My favorite thing about Ender is the fact that he is an underdog. He is a ""third,"" looked down upon by general society (ie. Mrs. Pumphrey's first grade class), he is small (even for a six year old), and he is an outcast (set aside because he is different). The only thing he has going for him is an intellect surpassing that of any child, as well as an undeniable charm, and an unrivaled ability to lead. These are the qualities that make him a perfect candidate for battle-school training and a later command position.Ender may be the most intelligent that Battle-school has ever seen, but perhaps for that very reason Ender develops many enemies, not the least of which is an honor-struck spaniard, named Bonzo. If Ender survives the rigerous training at battle-school that's only the first hurtle."
2,"No Good, and Has 2 Stars only b/c it reminds me of Ender","Well, I loved Ender's Game so much that I tried to get the magic of reading that book back. Ender's Shadow seemed the logical choice: written by the same author, and basically told in the same timeframe (and I didn't want to read a sequal, b/c so far all sequals have been disappointing). But, alas, this book did not bring back the magic. It seemed that Card wanted to make Bean extremely smart (too smart). This seemed to diminish what Ender had and what Ender had done. I didn't like the whole back story of Bean, and really wasn't interested in him at all. Basically, if you are trying to get that magic of ender's game through this book, then prepare to be disappointed."
3,"If you want the same novel as Enders Game, then read this on","Enders Game is perhaps the most compelling book I've ever read. Enders Shadow, is basically that, a book that stands in the shadow of Enders Game. I felt that it was basically good, just lacking in any of the originality that we had with Enders Game. It tried to hard to have that same magic. It just didn't make it for me."
1,would give zero stars,What is baffling to me is how fans of the original Ender's Game can like this book. Bean takes credit for many moments when Ender showed his brilliance. What? While I could understand if this were revisionist history - a bitter old Bean trying to relive glory days - I dont believe that is the case here. In the end this (and the subsequent books of the shadow series) seems like an author trying to relive his glory days but in doing so he undercuts the amazing accomplishment that was Ender's Game. I will now completely ignore these shadow books so I can keep rereading the original with the same wonder that I had the first time...and the second...and the third...
2,It didn't need to be a book.,"When I finshed the book I wondered when exactly Mr.Card jumped onto the Financial Bandwagon. I've read a lot of Mr. Card's books, and none of them stank of money like this one. I think we loyal fans were suckered, and that disappoints me. While I considered Ender's Shadow a decent read, it couldn't compare to Ender's Game. Not only that, but Ender's Shadow was unnecassary. I say this because a short story could have sufficed to tell the story that Mr. Card told in this book. I suppose for someone who hasn't read Ender's Game, Ender's Shadow would be an okay read. But as an avid fan, Shadow was a dissapointment. I expected a crisp, new story since it was from a new perspective. Instead it was the same story, just chewed up and regurgitated by Bean. I guess I expected better from Mr. Card. This is the first time he's ever dissapointed me with any piece of his writing."
2,Bean finds the Amazing Love of Jesus,If you liked Enders Game then this is an interesting sidestory. I did like Enders Game and I did like this book except that is for the drivel about Jesus. A little less Jesus-Freakin' and a little more substance and this book could have been really good.
3,"Great story, but too constrained by Ender's Game.","Card took on an original idea in developing an parallel novel to Ender's game. However, this literary experiment would have been more successful if both books could've been written simultaneously, or if Card would've understood Bean's character more when writing Ender's Game. As it is, intersecting the two stories seems forced at times.Card does some excellent writing here, though, creating a compelling character in Bean. And there is the possiblilty of a highly intriguing sequel."
4,Challenge to write,"I enjoyed Ender's Game enough to pick this title up just a few weeks later. I enjoyed it. It was nice getting back to Bean and Ender's world and the challenges they face. I actually think this is a better written book than Ender's Game. Card shows more maturity as a writer here, handling his main character's inner struggles with considerable skill. He does a great job of deepening Ender's story by weaving in all sorts of information not previously revealed. He found many ways to put an alternative spin on that previous story. It's really well done. As a book I don't think the impact of this is either greater or lesser than Ender's Game. It is truly a working companion novel which must've been very challenging to write. Recommended."
2,A disappointment,"I liked Ender's Game very much. I also liked the 3 sequels despite the fact they were radically different - much slower pace and less adventurous. The quartet was ammazingly brilliant, and I was looking forward to the next chapter. Being a parallel book, I was expecting another gem. Unfortunatelly, Major parts of the beginning (before battle school) lack credability and the looooooooong essays capturing Bean's thoughts are simply boring. I would give this book an even lower rating, if it wasn't Ender's Shadow. If I would read it first in the series, I would dump it in the middle."
4,A great point of view!,"I am a newfound sc-fi fanatic! I started with Ender's game and read all of the series. I found out about ender's shadow and had to get it. I absolutely love how Orson Scott Card took the same elements of the original ender's game and told it from a sub-character's point of view. I am waiting for the next one, I highly recommend this book, it is easy to read and understand, and you do not have to be a sci-fi freak to see the plot line. It is by far one of my favorit books, of course other than Ender's game. I also loved it so much because Bean was one of my favoirt character's he reminds me of Ender, but they are both two differnt character's so that is why it is such a great book! also read Shadow of the Hegemon! it's great also!"
4,Card returns to the top of his game,"For those who read ""Ender's Game,"" the sequels that followed it went on a painful downward spiral. ""Speaker for the Dead"" was ok, but things just dropped off from there. This book marks Card's return to form. It is not just a retelling of the same story from a diffeent person's perpective; it tells the story of Bean's origin and makes Achilles into a much more powerful and chilling presence than he was in ""Game. Some of the most interesting parts of the book, detailing Bean's life on the streets, occur prior to Bean's entry into Battle School. The rest of the book is fun too--well-executed, so much more than just the same story all over again."
4,"A challenge, as ENDER'S GAME was, but not the same.","If you read, and were moved by ENDER'S GAME, read this. If you have never read ENDER'S GAME,and like stories of almost unbearable choices, try this; the ""great surprise"" in ENDER'S GAME is not kept here (or, at least not as long) but the pain of impossible ethical decision is even sharper. I, for one, cannot read the climactic scene without tears; I don't say that about many things. Bean is someone you cannot forget."
5,awesome,"This is a simply amazing thing that Card has done. It tells its own unique story but enhances and deepens Enders Game as well. All I could think was that he should do a book through Colonel Graff's eyes, and one through Peter's eyes, and one through... Get the point. It deepens the story line to a level I did not even know existed, I never thought a story could be this engrossing. Another interesting thing would be to have read this before Enders Game and seen what it seem like. Again Card really knows what he is doing and this is the book that he shines with. A definate read if not a buy."
4,loved the shadow!,Ender's Shadow is a wonderful addition to the Ender series. I had a hard time putting it down. I feel like instead of taking away from the original book it added a new dimension to it and gave me more insight into Ender's Game. I loved Bean's character and how he overcame so many obstacles in his life and never felt cheated with what he was given. After reading Ender's Shadow I had to go back and reread Ender's Game to relive it through Ender's eyes. And i still loved that one as much too. They really compliment each other! Great reading.
5,Great Read,"I enjoyed the Shadow Series as much and maybe even more than the Ender series itself. Both great reads, but I really like the story of Bean."
5,Card Does it Again...,"Not surprisingly, this book lived up to all of the expectations placed upon it and more. Card displays his excellence by engaging the reader with multiple viewpoints, writing characters with ""perfect understanding"" as Ender might have said. The popularity of Card's Ender series continues 15 years past the first book in the series, and amazingly, I have tried for a month to win a used hardcover of this book on eBay for less than Amazon's hardcover price, all to no avail. It is simply too popular to obtain, so thank goodness they are releasing the paperback, which will be a wonderful addition to libraries everywhere. Thank you again, Mr. Card for another terrific voyage - please take us on another one soon."
4,Bean's no Ender,"When I saw Ender's Shadow on the shelf I was broke, but thought ""How can I not buy this book?"" because Ender's Game was one of the most impactful books in my life. So I bought it and read it till all hours of the night. It's a good story, full of OSC's magnificent touch, but it lacks Ender-quality. Ender alone will forever stand in my memory--he is the hero, not Bean."
4,"Better than ""Ender's Game.""","I didn't fall in love with ""Ender's Game"" like everyone else, but I decided to give this book a chance. Even though it takes place during the same time period and place, I found it worth reading. It stays more on point than the other book and was just easier to read."
5,Thank God I Can Relive The Adventure Again!!!,"Ender's Game captured my heart and my soul, and made me fall in love. When Ender's Shadow came out, I hoped it was going to capture me the same way. Well, it did! Card has a way of making you fall in love with his characters. I believe that's why he can get away with so many sequiles. Card, I thankyou, and long for your next. Please, don't die until I do!"
5,"Card is at the top of his ""game""!","You will absolutely fall in love with Bean, the new hero in this novel. If you loved Ender, you will love Bean just as much, maybe more! This is an intense read to the end -- even though readers of Ender's Game ""know"" how it ends, there are a lot of surprises. I couldn't put it down. Don't miss this one!"
5,A master of character and plot,"That about sums up how I feel about this book and the author. One of the deans of science fiction. I'd also recommend Dan Simmon's HYPERION series and Robert Doherty's AREA 51 series if you haven't read them yet. All different, but interesting."
5,Another masterpiece by OSC,"Ender's Shadow is an excellent book, although I feel that Ender's Game is better, and should in fact be read first. Whereas Ender's Game describes the world and events more slowly and in-depth, Ender's Shadow seems to assume that the reader has prior knowledge of some topics to a certain degree. However, even if you haven't read Ender's Game this book should still capture both your imagination and your heart!"
4,i liked it,"this is a good book if you liked enders game. i liked bean, and it was cool as i feel like it completes the enders game as it fills in a couple of blanks, it would be nice if he did the same thing but with diferent perspective of other characters, as i found them all interesting"
2,The second star is optimistic,"Okay, metaphor time. If ""Ender's Game"" and ""Speaker for the Dead"" (the two best books in the series) are Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back, respectively, then ""Ender's Shadow"" is The Phantom Menace. Good idea, bad follow-through. The writing is poor, the characters are wooden and not really true to the originals, and worst of all, the main character is so unlikable that one can only hope that he dies soon. The only reason that I gave this book 2 stars is because I hold out the same hope for this series as I do for the rest of the new Star Wars movies. Hopefully, now that the story is set up, the next books will be a vast improvement."
2,"Bean, like Alvin, is too perfect to believe.","I really enjoy Orson Scott Card's fiction, especially the Ender's Game series. However, he tends to overload his lead characters with superhuman abilities. In Ender's Shadow, this process happens too fast, and we never can appreciate the development of Bean's personality. We don't get to see him learn and grow the way we did with Ender in the first book. And while, as always, the world Card creates is engrossing in the tiny details, we've seen this one before, and it's not enough to carry the story. I would recommend reading ""Lost Boys"" or ""Saints"" instead, and saving your money on ""Ender's Shadow."""
1,Not worth reading,I had to read this book for school and it was torture. If you don't like Science Fiction this book will make your brain sick.
3,Much of the Ending Feels Like Revisionist History,"I'd rate the first half of this book 4 1/2 stars. Rotterdam, the Clean Place, and Bean's early days at Battle School are wonderful story lines. This is all new information which greatly compliments Ender's Game. However, from the point Bean and Ender meet up, the book becomes primarily a different perspective on the exact same sequence of events. While Bean's supreme brilliance is repeatedly tempered by the fact he lacks Ender's leadership skills, it still cheapens Ender's legend and feels like revisionist history. Ender's Shadow is still a fun read and a must-have for fans. I am hoping for more completely new stuff concerning Bean's return to Earth."
4,Another Wonderful Orson Scott Card Book,"Many people see this book as just a rewritten version of Ender's Game except from bean's view. That is true in part, but the story tells of bean's past, his thoughts, hopes and wishes. Without reading this book, it would be impossible to understand bean thoroughly.From the first moment I started to read the book, I was astonish. I simply could not believe that bean, such a small child, had come from the streets living as an urchin for the greater part of his life. Questions as to where bean came from, how he came to be in battle school and other thought provoking questions are answered in this book."
5,Card Scores Again!,"Everyone science fiction reader has no doubt heard of Cards flawless novel ""Ender's Game,"" which is by far the best science fiction novel ever written. Card enhances the story even more with his newest novel, ""Ender's Shadow,"" which features the small but highly intellengent Bean. I have always loved Bean as a character and found him even more enjoyable after reading this book.It isn't any ""Ender's Game"" but it's still very very good. If you loved ""Ender's Game"" you will love this one as well. Although Bean seems to be much like Ender, I found that it wasn't entirly true upon reading this book.There are twists and turns in this book, as in all of Card's books. And in the end you of course want to read it again. I really liked this book and I would call it my favorite science fiction if ""Ender's Game"" had never been written.""Ender's Game"" is a book which one cannot reproduce, however, ""Ender's Shadow"" comes very close."
1,Another money-maker for Mr. Card,"For the last 10 years OSC has come up with all sorts of ways to make money. Now he's mining the Ender saga for all it's worth. ENDER'S SHADOW is well written, fluid ... and boring. All Card is interested in is making money and he'll do anything he can to get people to think he's one of the greatest writers on the planet. All the critics in the SF field are his personal friends and the reviews he gets are ""non-reviews""; they just do backflips in praise of this man's alleged insight into the minds of children. This book will have a number of sequels or other ""parallel"" books: ENDER'S TENNIS SHOES, followed by ENDER'S CHRISTMAS followed by ENDER'S ORTHODONTIA and ENDER'S SUMMERTIME ROMANCE. I'm truly sorry I have contributed to Mr. Card's financial status over these years. But, boy, how the man knows how to get rich. EVERYBODY: DO NOT READ ANYTHING WRITTEN BEFORE 1980! Go back to the classics and forget Orson Scott Card's self-righteous narcissism."
3,Meh. Okay.,"I'm tired so I won't write a long-winded review, but, well, to me, Ender's Shadow didn't have the same punch Ender's Game delivered.I did enjoy reading about Bean's past as a street urchin in Rotterdam, and I truly loved the parts that were about Bean only. However, Bean's interactions with Ender...I didn't quite like that much. Of course some of the dialogue was parroted straight from Ender's Game, but Card seems to have seen the need to ""spice it up"" by shoving in a bunch of internal monologue between lines and well...it's cool at first, great, you know what Bean's thinking while Ender's talking, but then it gets more than a little aggravating. And I found it hard to believe how Bean was behind a lot of things that were never mentioned in Ender's Game, like the Dragon Army roster.But all in all, a pretty good book. Not a very bad one, per se. But again, it just doesn't have the same impact of Ender's Game."
5,Best Card Novel Yet,"I'm one who ranks Ender's Game as one of my all-time favorites, and have read virtually everything since that first short story and then novel that Orson Scott Card has written, with mixed thoughts on each. Examples: Game and Saints were superb, Speaker was OK, Lovelock not so OK.The concept of Shadow sounded unusual. I thought I'd be disappointed. I read along until Bean met up with Ender. Then I dug out the old ratty paperback of Ender's Game, and read that until I caught up to the same Ender/Bean encounter. I went back and forth several times, reading the books in parallel (they were written that way...why not read 'em that way?).Again, masterful, brilliant, and all sorts of other adjectives I can't think of. Don't know of any other SciFi novel attempted this way, and don't know of any writer that could have pulled it off as well."
2,Ender's Shadow,"My son loves these books but when he was reading this particular book he came across 30 pages missing from it and then certain pages repeated. It was very disappointing to him. I would like to get a new copy please. I have missed the ""return deadline"" because he just started reading this book. Very disappointing."
3,Its ok,If you read Enders Game then you will probably like this one. In my opinion Bean really isntcelevated enough to warrant a separate book but I read it on the recommendation of a friend.
5,Looking at Ender's Game all anew,"I respect Orson Scott Card a lot for innovating in his writing and trying new things. Ender's Shadow is a perfect representation of Card at his best. Ender's Shadow is essentially a retelling of Ender's Game through the character of Bean's eyes. While Ender and Bean were both brilliant students at Battle School, Card gives Bean a different and compelling backstory. Unlike Ender, who came from a middle-class American home, Bean rose from the mean streets but has genetically enhanced mental abilities. What I love is how Card toys with the parallel development of Bean and Ender. Ender, the lovable, friendly kid, becomes lonely through the burdens of command. Bean, the rough kid who depends only on himself, learns to form strong bonds with his troops.If you read Ender's Game and liked it, definitely read this book. Then reread Ender's Game again to really appreciate Card's ability to retell a story and make it fresh."
5,an awesome new view,"i read ender's game and absolutely loved it and was dying to read more about battle school and the bugger war. i also wanted to see ender from someone else's point of view. so, needless to say, i was very pleased when i found this book. it gives you a great taste of a different sort of life and a very different kind of person. this book was at least the equal if not better than ender's game (i say that b/c it doesn't have a long sappy bit at the end like ender's game...card keeps it short and sweet at the end of this book and you learn more about what the world is like and how the teachers work at the school). overall this book was really, really good with no competition."
3,Not bad,"I enjoyed this book, although it was nothing new. More like reading old journal entries in a way. Enjoyable. However, I felt the last 75-100 pages was more set up for the sequels which sort of turned me off. Otherwise, not bad."
4,"Very, very good","I look forward to seeing a sequel to this book, because I think that this is when Bean will really get to be his own character and stop being ""Ender's Shadow."" This book is very strong in many ways, but where it suffers is the fact that a lot of the book was simply a retelling, and not a new story. Still, it really was very, very good. I will be first in line to get a copy of the book that will surely come as a sequel to this."
5,Once again we're pleased by Mr. Cards work,"I must admit I was a bit apprehensive on whether Scott could make this concept of a parallel novel work. I shouldn't have worried. He left me gasping the way the original Ender's Game did many years ago.This book delivers on several levels. Astute political and military processes are thoroughly thought out. Look forward to the next novel in Ender's universe.BTW, I thought Urchin, Scott's original title, would have been a better title."
5,Scott's BEST BOOK IN YEARS!!!,"I am an OSC fan from way way way back. I think I have read every word he's ever published. I am still such a fanatic about Ender's Game, I buy used copies to give friends. ENDER'S SHADOW is remarkable, amazing, a great read. It will bring you back to everything you ever loved about Orson Scott Card. Remember Bean from Ender's Game? You will never forget him after reading ENDER'S SHADOW!! Trust me, get this book now. Do you need to read Ender's Game first? Probably not, but it will make the experience all the better. I think everyone should read Ender's Game before any other book."
4,"Great book, almost but not quite Ender's Game","This is my 2nd favorite OSC book after Ender's Game and it's a great read. Unlike a lot of readers, I was disappointed by Speaker for the Dead and Xenocide. If I could go back in time and do it again, I'd only read Ender's Game & Ender's Shadow, these two books complement each other beautifully and make for incredibly inspiring reading."
4,"Great, but lacking.","I think a lot of us can agree that _Ender's Game_ was awesome. Nothing can possibly compare. Upon hearing about _Ender's Shadow_ I got very excited..but I should have known that it would not have been what EG is. ES is as most of Card's works are very well written. I enjoyed it more than _Xenocide_ and I think it's at the level that _Speaker for the Dead_ is. I wish that I could say that this book is as gripping as EG, but it isn't. The momentum is not there."
2,Mixed Emotions,"I have been an avid OSC fan for many years. I first read Ender's Game in sixth grade and over the years I have worn the book literally to pieces. When I learned Ender's Shadow was to be released I was very excited. However, the book did not live up to my understandably high expectations. In EG, Ender was presented as a heroic, brilliant, and tragic young boy. It seemed to me that by making Bean even more brilliant than Ender, OSC made Bean the REAL hero. I read Ender's Shadow in two grueling days. In the end, I felt duped, and I felt that Ender had been cheated. The book is worth reading, but read Ender's Game first, it is by far the superior novel."
1,An attack on Ender's Game,"Ender's Game became, when I read it, one of my favorite books. This book is OK, alright, acceptable, etc. any middle of the road adjective you could think of and even that, it's only because it's based on a story I liked, in a location I liked, etc.So why not give it 4 or 3 stars?Because it actually seems to try to tear down Ender's Game.All the things you remember about Ender's Game, this book tells you they were actually WRONG!Ender is a smart kid? well NO, turns out he's ""slow"" compared to the title character in this book.Ender took a ragtag group of people and made them into a great 'army'? NO, the only reason he did well, was because the title character in this book chose a great army for him.Ender is a good leader? NO again, he only did well because the title character in this book was helping him behind the scenes.I could go on, but you get the gist. This book takes your prized memories of Ender from Ender's Game and tears them down.Extremely disappointing!"
3,"Good story but a ""shadow"" of Ender's Game.","I think I would have really enjoyed this book if I hadn't read Ender's Game first. Don't get me wrong, it was still a good read. I just felt that the author was short-changing Ender by writing this book and making it sound like Bean was the real hero. I thought Ender was a much better character. He was a genius but he was a kid too and he was a real underdog. I never got that feeling with Bean and I think that's a shame. It also lacked the meaningful ending that Ender's Game had. It was nice to see Bean meet his family but so much more meaningful to see Ender realize that this war he'd won had all been a misunderstanding. That's good stuff there... the kind that makes you question the wars in our own time.Despite that I do recommend this book. What I've read of OSC so far has been enjoyable. He's one of those writers that you want to read more than once to make sure you get everything. I'm looking forward to reading more from him."
2,"Repeat, rerun, blah blah blah","With this story Card revisits the original ""Ender's Game"" story from the point of view of the character ""Bean"". We learn more about Bean than we knew before and don't see much of Ender himself at all. It's the first in a new set of books. I haven't bothered to look at the one that comes after this.I'd say this is readable, good if you're really that ""into"" Ender's Game or Orson Scott Card, but very skip-able otherwise."
2,Put the word ENDER in and make some $,"I just finished reading Enders Shadow and I have this urge to let my feelings be known...I will keep it short. It seems to me that OSC is just trying to cash in on his largest commercial success with this latest ""Ender"" novel. The worst part of about this is that it seems to be working. In ES there are too many times where OSC has to bend the plot points of the original book to fit his new one. We are supposed to believe that Bean was this genius who was REALLY behind a lot of Enders supposed brilliance? I am a purest and a traditionalist and an admitted admirer of Enders Game but ES has changed a lot of how I viewed EG so now I must pretend that this new Ender book (and the inevitable sequels) don't exist and that hurts. By the way, did you know that Wantnot is really the Maker not Alvin!?!?!?!?!"
5,Enders Shadow,Great book. I had read Enders Game a while back and when I saw this book I had to read it. It gives Beans unique story plus the storyline of Enders Game from a whole different point of view.HenryV.A.
5,Great,"This book was great! I'm a longtime Card fan, so I loved this book. It's most similar to Ender's Game, which I also loved, but you don't have to have read EG to get Shadow. I've reccommended it to everyone I know- Read, it, you'll like it."
5,Addicting read with minor flaws,"I found this book addicting just as I found all the earlier novels in Card's Ender series. While it was not as engaging or profound as the first three books in this saga, I still found it an entertaining book that provided new insights into the story of Ender, and brought a new image to Bean. I believe the biggest flaw in the novel is Card's stretch to make the new Bean fit the old Bean's dialogue, and during those moments I found myself waiting for them to end so the new Bean would return. I still give it five stars, even though it doesn't compare in my mind with Game, Speaker, and Xenocide, because to me, those deserve six. But for anyone who loves the Ender series as I do, this is a must-read."
4,"Good, But not as good as Ender's Game","I feel in love with Ender's Game as soon as I first read it the entire concept was so perfect. When I heard about Ender's Shadow I got it as soon as it was released, and read it before the night was over. I was frankly disappointed, while Card does suceed in making the opening incredible and I throughly enjoyed Graf I found Bean's later history...disappointing. While in Ender's Game the you got to see Valentine and Peter aswell as Ender in Ender's Shadow Card creates a ""super"" human out of Bean. It ruined it for me, some of the moments were good, but the entire brother thing was just a little too much cheese. I was especially disappointed by the ending, half of what made Ender's Game so good was the fact Ender could never return. It was still a great read but not nearly as good as I could have hoped."
1,Extremely annoying.,"When I first heard Orson Scott Card was writing another book that took place in the Ender's Game universe I was exited, to say the least. After reading the first four chapters of Ender's Shadow, attainable at the official web site of OSC, I ,almost literally, couldn't wait. Now that I've read the novel cover to cover I am thoroughly disappointed. It does not complement Ender's Game, which is my favorite book, it tries to overpower it. Although Ender's Shadow never contradicts Ender's Game, the two books often disagree.Many of the reviews that gave this book five stars were done by people who had read only the first four chapters, which were extremely good. This latest Orson Scott Card novel shows that while OSC's grasp on scientific principles has increased, his knowlage of what makes a great novel has dramaticly decreased."
5,Excellent book to any SF standard,"I was a bit dissapointed when Ender's Shadow came out that it was a parallel novel to Ender's Game, and not the sequel to Children of the Mind as I had secretly wished for for years!But the book turned out to be an intensive reading, incredibly addictive, and in many ways turned out to be much better than the original. OSC's ability to tell the same yet totally different story is amazing. And being able to see behind the set of Ender's story is a unique feeling, close to the feeling you get when watching the Usual Suspects' Director's Commentary on the DVD edition.Now, Orson, please tell us the rest of the Descolada story. We really can't wait any longer..."
5,Card's best book in years!!!!,"This is Orson Scott Card's best book in years. I am 11, planning to graduate from high school in 2000, and I always empathized with Ender more than any other character. I liked Speaker for the Dead, Xenocide, and Children of the Mind, but they look at the world through an adult's eyes, instead of the growing, changing child prodigy I knew in Ender's Game. I always thought that Ender grew up too fast, and I wanted more books featuring him as a child. While Ender's Shadow and Bean can neeer fill Ender's shoes in my heart, they can take their place next to him. I think this is Card's best book, other than Ender's Game, and I can't wait to read the full novel."
5,fantastic book!,"Ender's Shadow lives up to Card's highest standards. It's thoughtful, interesting, and you become completely involved with Bean. A must read for Card fans and science fiction fans in general."
4,Not Really in Ender's Shadow,"Ender's Shadow is the first book of the Bean Series of the Orson Scott Card books. The main character is a small orphan from the streets of Rotterdam, named Bean, named for his size and worth. Eventually he is taken to Battle School like Ender in Ender's Game. It takes place around the same time as Ender's Game, and is about the killing of the buggers, like Ender's Game. Bean is cooler and better than Ender, and more fun to read. He is much smarter and better at the Battle Room then Ender. Bean is in a few parts in Ender's Game, and Orson Scott Card, has those same parts in Ender's Shadow. Everything that has Bean in it from Ender's Game is in Ender's Shadow, but it also includes Bean's thoughts instead of Ender's. Except for one mistake, Scott Card matched the books perfectly, even though he wrote Ender's Shadow, 22 years after Ender's Game. Bean and Ender's Shadow, is not in the shadow of Ender and Ender's Game."
5,A book for all ages,"I loved this book. I read it right after reading Ender's Shadow and they were both great. I'd never read any sci-fi before, so I was hesitant but as soon as I finished Ender's game I rushed to buy Ender's Shadow. It's about Bean, a character in Ender's Game. It kept me as intrigued as the first one and I would recommend it to anyone."
2,Revisited but not improved,I have this problem with Scott Card's children -- they read about 12 years older than they are supposed to be and it's definately the case in this work which revisits Ender Wiggin's childhood but from a very different point of view. In the notes Scott says he was originally going to open this to other authors. I think he should have. It's a not very good sequel that lacks the power of Ender's Game.
5,Nerd at Heart,"I had to read Ender's Game in High School for Summer Reading but strangely enough, found that I loved the whole Enders series. 10 years later, I'm still re-reading this book because it is by far my favorite of all the Ender books. If you're a nerd at heart and/or you love sci-fi (you don't have to love sci-fi for this particular one), then you'll love this book"
4,A good read,"I read Ender's Game many years ago and sequel, did not like the sequel, this book is not a sequel but tells the same story as Ender's Game from the perspective of another child. I enjoyed it much more than the sequel and recommend it for anyone who enjoyed Ender's Game."
5,One of the classic,"The shallow series is one of my most beloved book series ever. I begun the story with Ender but I end up loving Bean. This book is a mixed of Oliver Twist and lords of the flies. But if you are a Ender's fan, you might not like this book very much. This book discredited almost all of Ender's achievement in ender's game."
5,Every bit as enjoyable as Ender's Game,"As the editorial review states, a parallel story to Ender's Game, taking us along the life of Bean, a brilliant kid with a mysterious past ... and dangerous enemies. Just as absorbing in its portrayal not only of the machinations of Battle School and its adult leaders, but of the lives of children as they really are, even the killers (which was what shocked many adults - and got them hysterical - about Ender's Game). We are given a little more depth into the final battle, and more interaction between Ender and Bean.As always, Card's prose and dialogue are sharp and thoughtful. A worthwhile read."
4,A great addition to the Ender Series,"This story parallels Ender's Game, but is told from the view of Ender's sidekick, Bean. We learn about Bean, what makes him tick and why we should even care. We also see Ender from another perspective.As with Orson Scott Card's other books, it is exciting, suspensful, and thrilling.It was difficult to put the book down and I anxiously awaited the sequel. If you liked Ender's Game, you will like this series too. If you didn't like the sequels to Ender's Game, you will still like this one."
5,More like Bean's Game than Ender's Shadow,"Finally the story of Bean is told and told well. Although this character shows up very late in Ender's Game, I was as intrigued by him as I was with Ender. This book does Bean full justice and in a way it's a better character study because Ender's Game put Ender a bit on a pedestal and hard to reach, but with Ender's Shadow, Card really brings you into Bean's head and gives you details about his past.The title of the book is my only reservation as I think Bean holds his own very well. But I guess Card had to for the public recognition. I'd hate to give anything away but I loved learning how much more involved he was with the mission than previously thought. It made me read Ender's Game again to get the nuances missed before and then Ender's Shadow AGAIN to really get a grasp of the whole story."
2,Ender's Shadow does not live up to Ender's Game...,"This is a parallel novel to Ender's Game. It relates the same events of Ender's Game, but from the point of view of Bean. Ender's Shadow begins when Bean is four years old and barely surviving on the street. It tell of his struggle to survive and then his triumph in being accepted to Battle School. This novel has some new surprises in it. Surprises that I thought were unbelieveable. The book itself is a good read, however, it is not as good as Ender's Game. Some of the revelations are just too much in the sense that you almost feel contempt for Ender and shout to yourself, ""Why doesn't he see this? Why is he letting himself be manipulated by Bean?"". At least I did! I just did not accept or want to accept what Card was telling us about Bean. I have been looking forward to this novel for months and I can tell you that I was disappointed! The concept was so great, but I think that Card fell a little short on Ender's Shadow."
2,Ender's Shadow,"I thought this would be as good as Ender's Game, but it was not. It did not keep my interest, and I quit before the end."
2,Audiobook rendition disappoints,"First, let me clarify by saying that I have read the book, and enjoyed it tremendously. I felt Card was at the top of his game. The rendition by Michael Gross in audio was, however, disappointing. I'll admit right away that I could listen to no more than a half-hour of it before switching it off in disgust. His treacly rendition of Bean was the final straw - Bean is a tough little survivor, not a ""Pweshus cyoot little kid"", as Gross' voice suggests. I had picked up the audio on the promise of Harlan Ellison's readings (not a major part, to be sure, but he's a great reader) but never got that far. I _have_ listened to numerous audio books and have found that the reader makes all the difference in the world. In this case, the cuddly father-figure type of reader just didn't match the parent-less society that Card created. Stick with the book."
2,Not enough differences to make it interesting.,The book was far too similar to 'Ender's Game'. Bean's perspective was too introspective and not that interesting and my God was that Nun annoying. The book could have been 100 pages shorter.It is also evident that Card is writing this book with an eye to even more un-necessary sequels. Too many loose ends that I am not interested in following.
2,Sure it was a good follow up but does it even touch Ender,"Come on guys, lets all face it that Orson is a great writer but wouldn't we have rather had a sequel to Ender instead of one of his tag-alongs. Ender was the greatest, therefore none of his glory should have been taken away by the fact that Orson was hoping to grab people's attention by using Ender's legacy....For God's sake look at the title. Card looks like a pimp trying to prostitute Ender's name for more money."
3,"Interesting idea, wrong direction","Card attempts to write a parallel novel to Ender's Game, but he finds himself constantly constrained by the requirements of consistency. Ender's shadow turns out unfocused and awkward. Perhaps Card should have written a less restricted (and somewhat inconsistent) companion novel instead. I look forward to reading The Shadow of the Hegemon, as there is far more room to develop Peter than Bean."
5,One of my favorites!,I bought the hard cover of this book because I already have the hard cover of Ender's Game. I love both of these books as well as George Orwell's 1984. I would recommend this to anyone who hasn't read it yet! Its a great compliment to Ender's Game.
5,Swell Books,"Card has produced by far my favorite books, Ender's Game and Ender's Shadow. They do have a plain style of writing, although it did make the story center around the story and not the author. This book in particular associated itself in my mind with Radiohead's Scatterbrain so that was quite nifty, too. I have almost all the books but I haven't read them all yet but I certainly plan to. My teacher read Ender's Game to us in middle school and I was able to see how great it was even though I DESPISE when people read to me.I find it so unbelievable that people would find this to be a bad book, but I guess I should expect the worst such as my favorite author being a homophobe. YES! I SAID IT!!! ORSON SCOTT CARD IS A HOMOPHOBE! but that won't take away the feelings I have for the series. I love the lessons in Ender's Game and Ender's Shadow and that's all I will take away from it and I hope people will be able to, also, because they are great books."
4,for those that couldn't get enough of Ender's game,"While not necessarily in the brilliant category of Ender's Game, Ender's shadow is nonetheless a wonderfully entertaining read. No fan of the original will be let down, you also won't feel the same sense of discovery. It may then come as ironic that I believe one should definitely not read this book without first having read Ender's game."
3,Definitely not Ender's Game,"Simply put: Ender's Shadow was good only because I enjoyed Ender's Game so thoroughly. It was interesting to get another perspective on this excellent story, but as a stand-alone novel it was mediocre. Read Ender's Game if you have not already and maybe perhaps read this one if you are so inclined."
4,"Good plot, good end","I really enjoyed the book, and I thought that the twists of the plot were creative. Orson Scott Card has struck gold again here. What I enjoyed most were the small details that bonded Ender's Shadow with Ender's Game. The small things that showed Bean's different point of view due to his hard life on the street held the novel together. It kept this prize of a book from becoming just another sequel. A must read. Maybe Card should write a sequel about Bean's enteraction with Ender's brother and sister..."
4,A little information,"I would normally never presume to review a CD when there are so many knowledgeable reviewers of any given musical genre about - however, as there is no other review of this CD, I'll pass on a bit about it. Most of the pieces were written by Fawzy Al-Aiedy, a couple of them instrumentals, some traditional Iragi songs, a couple are traditional Egyptian. Most of the music is very evocative and languid. I had to listen to the CD a few times before I liked it, but now as I listen to it, I imagine myself poling a flat-bottomed boat over still water in the failing light of a hot Eastern sun (as shown on the cover photo!). Probably you'd have to be a real fan of this genre (which is I suppose quite traditionally Iraqi) in order for the CD to become one of your favorites, but still very interesting. Hope this helps."
4,Price drop for Acrobat but only for filling in forms,"This is the equivalent for Acrobat 5 of Business Tools as a cut-down version of Acrobat 4. So far Amazon have not described the number of seats you get but it should be lots, much cheaper than the one at a time download price at Adobe.Forms filling is pretty boring but at least the design should look nicer with PDF unless you demand animation. The paperless office might be getting closer. Many organisations should be able to afford Acrobat at this price level.5 stars should wait for an update which included markup tools. There is a basis for this in the eBook Reader version so why not? The full product is worth getting for PDF creation so would still sell anyway."
2,"""Vigil"" meets ""The Mummy""","If you like Jerry Goldsmith, you'll love James MacMillan. Excellent orchestration that moves the music along a la your favorite Saturday matinee. If I wasn't told to feel all holy and sacred, I'd say ""please pass the popcorn."""
2,Piece of Junk,One of the screwes got blunt as I was installing this. My materials were very light and flimsy and the product was not sturdy at all. It ended up in the thrash the same day. Waste of money. :(
4,Perfect Fit,"I bought 2 of these trolleys to add organization to our closet. One for my husband and one for me. They fit perfectly under the hanging clothes and hold all of our pants. We have hardwood floors so we have no trouble with rolling or moving them.I would have given this product a 5 star if the material was more than just aluminum tubing. Not the sturdiest, but we have had no issues with it breaking we have been using them daily for 5 months.This product did exactly what I needed, added hanging space for our pants and organized the closet."
4,pants trolley for extra room in or out of closet,"This is a tidy device for extra pairs of pants, takes up very little room and keeps pants wrinkle free. I find it very useful in a house with scant closet space and LOTS OF CLOTHING. it also comes with extra hangers, which are not listed here, in sets of six."
4,Nice Rack!,"This trolley is great, it fits perfectly in my closet under my shirts, the reason i gave it 4 out 5 stars is that the metal frame is not as solid as i would like, therefore I would discourage rolling it around too much wen fully loaded. But I definitely recommend it."
1,Cheap,"I almost sent it back after assembly. It is flimsy. In my case I will keep it stationary, but if I had to move it much it would be a problem holding togetherThe hangers are also too thin and tend to crease my pants.NOT recommended. Spend a little more and get something more durable and functional"
1,wheels don't stay put,"I purchased this item and there is no green fabric on either end, so I am not sure if the wrong thing was sent. There is no hardware included to secure the casters, so they just keep coming out and the trolley cannot be rolled in and out of the closet easily (or at all). Is there a part missing? If not, i am returning this item because it is useless."
2,Missing items,"This trolly I did not find all to great like some of the other reviews said. It had only came with three wheels, 14 of the hangers, and it was unbalanced."
2,missing parts for Rolling Pants Trolley,"First one of the screws are missing. Instead of 8, there was only 7. I will shop for the missing hardware."
4,Metal Hangers,"The cart is good. Easy to assemble. The one thing I don't like about the cart is the wire hangers. I didn't want to hang my pants on wire hangers. My husband purchased vinyl tubing at the hardware store, slit it down the middle and cut them to the right lengths. I slipped the tubing over the hanger part my pants will touch & I hope that will stop wire hanger creases in my pants. If not I think I'll upgrade to a wooden hanger cart. The cart is a great solution for me. The wire part not so much."
5,MORE STORAGE ROOM ANYONE!!!,"This sure helped to open up our space in the small closet we have, now I just need to order more hangers, but I am not sure they will fit very many more, I may end up ordering a whole trolley or getting rid of some pants. lol The seller and the time it took for shipping were wonderful."
4,Pretty good!,"This is a decent closet organizer! You do have to be careful putting it together, and it's a little wobbly, but once done, mine has stayed together quite well and adds to my closet space, which is all I wanted. I highly recommend this if you're trying to get organized on a budget."
2,Just OK,"While it does what it is designed for, it is very cheaply made and not very sturdy. One of the wheels will not stay attached."
2,the golden haired prince put to shame,I bought this toy and i was pretty dissapointed He was cool for an hour. His face is kinda big and bulky. His super saiyn sound effect is annoying.He is very undurable he is a disgrace to Vegeta Not to completly discourage you but dont waste your money.
4,Nice exhibition catalog,"This exhibition catalog is only 36 pages long but is very well done. It is printed on heavy stock and has a very clean attractive layout. There are 14 very large color pictures of some of the pieces in the exhibition, each with a note providing information including the name of the artist, the artist country of residence, year pot made, pot dimensions, clay and glazes used and method of firing. I would have given 5 stars if more pieces had been photographed. They did at least provide an informational note on all the pieces that were not illustrated."
1,"Troll 2, Move Over","Mi Amigo, made in 1998, is a movie of staggering awfulness, and should be seen by anyone who appreciates cinematic abortions. Intoxicants are suggested for optimum enjoyment."
1,Mi Amigo what??????,"This movie sucks big time, not what I expected at all, the story line read very good and made me want to buy it. Waited for the movie to ""DO SOMETHING"" to keep my interest. I am so disappointed with this movie. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY like I did. It's next stop is the dump after I smash it with a hammer. I had to rate this movie in order to proceed with this review. I want to give it NO rating at all but since I had to, my rating would go only to the actor. The guy who plays Sawyer from the series Lost, should stay on the Lost series. Wish I had my money back on this one........"
2,A Departure for Cobham,"The drums are unmistakeably Billy Cobham, but the music is quite different from the style we've been accustomed to since the early 70s. This is the first Cobham album I've heard that eschews the popping-bass funk groove in favor of an all-acoustic, traditional jazz set, with mixed results. This is a quartet with piano, acoustic bass and saxophone playing rather unmemorable riffs over Cobham's powerful drumming. It's worth noting that only two of the selections are written by Cobham; you can tell right away which ones they are. The first time I played this album I heard a lot of things I liked; the next morning, when I played it a second time, it seemed meandering and undistinguished. Go figure. Probably not the best choice for those unfamiliar with Cobham's work, who would probably be best served by checking out his sessions with Miles Davis and John McLaughlin first."
1,Annoyed at work,"I absolutely LOVE the original Cranium game, so I figured I'd just have to have one for all my silly co-workers to play too.I was hugely disappointed when I found out that the game answers are NOT printed on the back of the card, instead you must log onto the Internet to get answers.What a time consuming annoying thing!Forget it if you don't have Internet access in your office.I think there should be a list of answers to print out somewhere and take with you."
4,Cosmo Discontinued - Answers no longer available,"Just something to be aware of: when Hasbro bought Cranium earlier this year, they took down [...] website and with it the answers to all the questions. So, while it's still usable, it's a little frustrating that you can no longer get the answers if everyone in your office is stumped.That said, I really like this game and have been through a number of answer packets over the years. It's always been popular in any office I worked in."
3,Horrible red-eye effect,"The red-eye effect is enough reason to consider not buying this camera. If you take many indoor pictures in low-light situations every one of your subjects will have a red-eye! Silly for such an otherwise great camera. Much cheaper cameras have solved this simple problem! If I cannot find a way to reduce this effect easily through software, I will return the camera."
4,Very good picture and MPEGs too,"I was impressed with the image quality and its ability to make MPEG movies (up to 30 seconds in length including sound). The memory sticks are not the best value in compact digital media (smartmedia flash memory cards are). These sticks also cannot be read directly unless you buy an adapter or use a slow serial interface. Exception being some newer Sony computer systems can read them. I knock off a star from the rating for their omission of i.Link and choosing a more expensive digital storage medium. Their digital picture frame also costs as much as the camera, which I think is very imbalanced price-wise."
2,bare on the facts,"The narrator mentions his parents, his wife, and the age of his death. Still, this work is threadbare on the facts. For example, they note that he wrote ""Sharazad"" (sp?) and they play a 3-minute clip of it, but that's all.Too many docs on entertainers become boring slide lectures. The creators here try to have movement. For example, they show photos of Rimsky's relatives but they move the camera from the wall where they hang to a busy outside scene. Old operas are shown with singing and moving performers.This may keep your interests, but you won't learn much. That's for sure."
2,Not as realistic as it thinks,"Sweetwater and Gunslinger are the cllsigns of the crew of an F-14 fighter which was, when this book came out, the US Navy's top interceptor. While two-man aircews should be enough to generate the structure around which can be built a great aviation novel (like ""Flight of the Intruder""), it's wasted here as we watch the two engage in the sort of antics popularized in Top Gun while the top brass watches powerless, and aged admirals watch wishing they could be young nuggets again. Much of the novel is episodic, and not written very well, following the boys as their aircraft carrier charts the expected hostile waters, but we never feel as is we are actually there. The airplanes aren't fully realized, nor are the struggles of becoming a proficient aviator made out well enough to describe the charachters and why their superiors tolerate them. Ditch this book for anything else by Coonts."
5,John Wayne Legend Movie Pack,"Brought this movie pack and the other John Wayne Hero Movie Pack for my elder aunts and uncle and my mother....they just enjoy watching John Wayne in his westerns and they hadn't seen these in a long time...In this movie pack, nine of the movies are in B&W, almost an hour long each, and from the 1930's and the 10th movie (McLintock) is in color, from the 1960's, and just over 2 hours long....we put these on to play when is nothing else that they can find to watch on TV, since TV is their primry source of entertainment because of their inability to move around...I would recommend this movie pack and the other movie pack."
2,John Wayne - 10 cowboy legend movie pack,"While the price was OK for this product, it has 9 black & white short movies (all under an hour) and one full-length colored movie that was over an hour (McClintock). I was expecting copies either made from originals or digital copies; however, the quality was very poor. The quality looked like VCR copies that had been burned onto a DVD on a home machine, there was no clean-up - I can only stress the poor quality of the video itself."
4,Movie pack,I bought these for my husband and he loves them. it is a great product for the price. the reason I gave it a four is because most of the movies are black and white. i think there is only one that isn't. other then that we love it.
1,DIFFERENTIATING SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS,"WHEN I RECEIVED THIS BOOK, IT LOOKED LIKE IT HAD BEEN RUN OVER BY A TRUCK, AND THE =N PUT THROUGH A RINGER. I TOOK IT TO THE POST OFFICE BUT THEY SAID THAT THERE WAS NOTHING THAT THEY COULD DO SINCE IT WASN'T INSURED. I HAD TO GO BUY A NEW BOOK"
3,"Not much on the differentiation, but a good catalogue","The title led me to believe the book would go into depth regarding the subtleties in differentiating between instruments which are very much alike. Instead, the book acts as a good text for the surgical tech student who is still working on getting the basics under his belt. Instruments aren't really differentiated in the book so much as listed with pictures according to specialty. It's good as a general reference, but not for any detailed study."
5,This One Is As Good As His First Album,"Nothing can compare to Monte's abilities on the 6 string guitar. In my opinion, he stands alone amongst the ranks of guitar masters. Alvarez Guitars' decision to utilize him in their advertising is sufficient testament to that."
5,"I ""Took Too Long"" to find this band!","I was given ""Mirror"" by my boyfriend and now I am going to order ""1st and Repair""...does that say anything to you?Monte Montgomery has the most soulful voice that is so full of passion. His musicianship is totally 1st Class. Actually, I think he is in a class by himself. Someday I will see him live and he will have a real screamer on his hands.Thanks Monte!"
5,!!!WOW!!!,"I saw this artist on public broadcast system, Austin City Limits, along with Bruce Hornsby. I just couldn't get over how great Montey Montgomery and his band sound, and look. Watching him on T.V. and how he just manipulates the guitar is nothing short of extraordinary! I will get both of his cd's as soon as possible, but in the mean time, I will be playing the video I recorded from tv. If you have heard of this artist from a friend who thinks you will like it, take their advice and go get it! Five stars does not do him justice."
5,This record is the best I've heard since his first.,"Monte just blows me away. I've seen him perform six or seven times now and every time he just gets better. I never thought he could ever make a better record than ""1st and Repair"" but he certainly proved me wrong, much to my delight. Guitar playing talent has never been matched with such magical lyrics and wonderful vocals as in Monte Montgomery. Nothing brings a smile to my face like watching and listening to Monte play. Thank you Monte.Lenny in Austin, TX"
3,"great musician, inconsistent songwriter","Monte is easily one of the best guitarists around, and belongs in the same category as Bruce Cockburn (if you like this style, make sure you own Charity of Night). He has, without a doubt, the greatest tone and control on acoustic guitar I have ever heard. Unfortunately, his songs, like Cockburn's, often fall into the category of pop duds. Sure, he throws in great guitar solos, but he is definitely a product of 80's pop. There are some great songs on this album, but nowhere on it does he reach the high of ""Love Comes Knockin'"" from 1st and Repair, which sounded like SRV's Riviera Paradise if Stevie had spent a few more years crafting it (this is, of course, among the highest praise one can give to a musician). 1st and Repair is a must-own. Mirror is optional. If Monte could hook up with Cockburn or someone like that for an album or two, maybe they could prevent each other from getting into that sappy pop garbage and keep each other on track."
4,The Best Monte!,"I've been listening to Monte for a few years now. I've re-listened to all his CD's and seen him in concert many times. That said, I've come to the conclusion that this is the ""best"" Monte on record, so far. It makes for a great starting point for the uninitiated. The guitar playing is excellent. The songwriting is first rate. The tone is set from the first song and hits a very nice stride with the title song ""Mirror"". A similar pace continues throughout with a nice change of pace in the ragae inspired concert favorite ""When Will I"". Hard to pick a favorite. The ballads are typically not the strongest Monte material, but are very good on this record. All in all, his most consistent effort and the best showcase for his considerable guitar skills. A solid 4-1/2 star effort."
1,CLASSICS??,"These songs aren't Catholic Classics; they're Catholic contemporary trash. This is nothing more than a collection of the tritest Catholic worship music written since the Second Vatican Council. If you are looking for real Catholic Classics, I suggest you look elsewhere (there're plenty of good recordings of chant, sacred polyphony, etc. available on Amazon.)"
3,Makes the songs inaccessible,"When I came upon this entry and the track listing, I was excited to finally find a collection of Catholic music that is regularly sung in my own Parish. However, after listening to the samples, I have to agree with some of the other listeners that the tone of the recordings is not the joyful one that I'm used to. I find these versions inaccessible and distant. This is not a recording to sing along to, as in church with a cantor. Rather, this is clearly and overproduced performance and that is just not what I'm looking for in a collection of Catholic music."
5,Very Helpful Guide,"This book has provided me with important information as a consumer of medical services, and has provided my mother peace of mind as someone who has been undergoing a number of medical tests. The book clearly defines various procedures, patient preparation, and often includes comments about tests that patients are seldom told but ought to know. This book has been so helpful. I am a layperson with no medical knowledge. But to be able to describe a test to my mother in advance of the procedure, to let her know when it is non-invasive versus invasive, to know what kinds of physical symptoms or complications may follow a test...this has been invaluable information. I strongly recommend this book for anyone who has to undergo, or has someone close to them who will undergo, medical tests. The price is [reasonable] given how much useful and potentially lifesaving information it contains."
2,I give it a 'D',"I give the graphic novel ""30 Days of Night"" a 'D'. It was too short and not enough suspense (it's not scary if you just go straight to the gore) and not enough character development. The artwork was blurry and inconsistent. Because there wasn't enough character development I never sympathized with the characters. In this rare case, I think the movie adaptation was better than the original graphic novel."
3,"Great idea for a vampire story, but it fall's flat.","This graphic novel has beautiful artwork and an amazing idea, but it feels like an outline for a story rather than a finished product. Ifyou are interested in this, go see the movie. There's more to it and you wont feel like you missed something...I never though I'd say that..."
3,A little disappointing,"After hearing from one of my friends how great this book was and that I should definately read it, I had to see what all the fuss was about. I thought the story wasn't bad, but it was a tad bit boring. Also, the artwork just didn't do it for me. I'm not saying it was bad or anything, I mean, I know there's people who like this type of artwork, and I'm not trying to offend it in any way, but personally, it just didn't work. For me, this book was just alright."
4,Creepy and atmospheric,"Steve Niles', '30 Days of Night,' is a smartly written and beautifully drawn graphic novel that will certainly be appreciated by any horror/vampire afficionado out there. The premise alone is chock full of so much potential that it's almost remarkable that is hasn't been done before. While the story is cleanly and briskly plotted, the middle act (the town of Barrow under siege) should have been further fleshed out. Due to its relatively short length, it seems as if the book comes to a somewhat abrupt halt at the end but even with this put aside, the book is still very much worth your reading time with a great storyline and equally remarkable artwork by Ben Templesmith."
5,The best comic of the year,"Yes, I liked it a lot. A friend of mine passed me a copy but as I don't like vampire stories I had on my table a couple of weeks. Finally I decided to have a look on it and I couldn't drop it until I read all the story. I love the end and I think that the art fits perfectly in the atmosphere of the tale. I recommend this book to all the good comic readers. I think that it will become a classic, only compared with the great books of the last decades, like Watchmen, V for Vendetta, Batman Dark Knight and so on."
3,"Good, but not up to the hype...","People have been paying a lot of money to pick this story up on Ebay. It's a fantastically original concept that, unfortunately doesn't quite live up to the hype (not that anything could). The art is fine, surreal and spooky, but the story is reminiscent of Stephen King's X-Files episode: a wonderful, spooky start, but it can't sustain the pace. It's worth reading, though - especially the very moving last page."
2,"great art and idea, weak storytelling","After hearing great things about this book from so many people I expected a lot more. The story isn't bad, the book is just too short to tell it (around 80 pages). The characters are pretty one dimensional and I never really cared whether they lived or died. If they would have doubled the length and developed the characters more it might have been worthy of all the praise. As it is, it's pretty dissapointing."
3,It ain't great...,"It's decent, but not great. The artwork is excellent, the violence is magically delicious, but the story..... hmmmph. The story is truncated and limp. It's as if the creators wanted to hurry up and finish with this whole thing. I wanted to see a more detailed storyline of the vampires killing off the townspeople... but what we get instead is the vampires arrive in town, and the next page the townspeople are down to just a small group of survivors. It's like there's a HUGE chunk of the story missing from the middle. It's a decent book and, hesitantly, I dare say it is worth the price (especially if you get a used copy).... but don't open the book with high expectations or you'll close it with a feeling of disappointment."
4,Not bad,Good story to introduce you into this series. It made me want to investigate other episodes. Overall a fun read.
4,A review for first storyline...,"Just when I thought there is nothing left after reading Moore, Gaiman and Keith (considering US published titles), I got into this series. Story is better every issue and artwork is very unorthodox considering today's biggest publishers, yet great in my opinion. I got this one and two sequels and I am continuing to read it. If you like this trade, get it's two sequels, it's first storyline in this innovating take on old themes. If you read stuff for art and like it, get all you can get :)"
2,Disappointing,"The story is cliche ridden, the characters are flat and the artwork is murky. It's like something put together by talented highschool kids."
2,boring and cliched....,"i don't know why this book gets such high ratings. it's just another average horror movie put onto paper. templesmith's art is interesting though.... for about 3 pages. after that, it just gets old. character dialouge is bland and reactions to ""scary"" situations are cliche. characters aren't given any depth and the story doesn't really focus on anything in particular. overall it's a boring, anti-climatic read with a cliche plot twist. weak beans."
2,Wait for the movie...maybe,"I really anticipated the release of this comic. When it finally arrived, I was encouraged by the moody stylistic art and potential for a really great story. How totally disappointing! The plot was weak, and had huge gaps. It soon became abundantly clear that this was a shameless bid at a movie deal, which worked. Hopefully someone like Sam Raimi can actually make something worth watching, because 30 Days of Night is definitely not worth reading."
2,Why the hype?,"Ok, first of all i love vampires. but this?Steve Niles comes up with an interesting concept here, with a town with 30 days of night, but the actual story reads like a high school short story collection entry. He seemed so wrapped up in the concept that he had no idea how to end the story. You can see how he starts off explaining in a huge info dump at the beginning of the story. This is prime example of the ""Telling, not showing"" which goes against most creative writing paradigms. Now, that being said, the story's weakest section is the ending. He just seemed to end it, with many loose ends and plot holes.The artwork was interesting though. I will not go so far as to say i liked it, because it was too obscured and foggy for my taste, but i can understand the artist's intent.This was just a book that was hard to keep in my hands, rather than hard to put down.And now they are making a movie? there is hope for it, but they better not stay exact to the story of this comic book."
3,An okay beginning...,"It is true that Mr. Niles does not take advantage of a wonderful idea, like he does in Return to Barrow, however it is still a great story, and it is also the beginning of an interesting trilogy. I was fortunate enough to read each comic as it came out, so I had the luxury of feeling the time seem to pass by inbetween reads. 30 Days of Night does not translate well into a graphic novel. It cuts off at points and is too fast of a read. Steve Niles does not take the time allowed to put the reader on the edge of his or her seat. But, it is the beginning to Dark Days and Return to Barrow, which are both far better developed.If you are a hard core fan of vampires then get the book for its uniqueness. He does not make the vampire lifestyle romantic in anyway. However, if you are looking for a good read then pass this by and read Kingdom Come."
2,Most Disappointing Book of the Year,"The plot is little more than a rehashed ""Night of the Living Dead,"" with the main difference ostensibly being that it is supposed to take place over the space of a whole month. Unfortunately, the book is poorly paced and, if not for the title, you would think the story took place over the space of a few hours. Key scenes are glossed over or summarized by the narration, making this read like an excerpt, not a full book,. As for characters, only the sheriff is given a backstory that makes him seem like anything other than ""vampire fodder."" Skip this book and wait for the promised movie. Hopefully, a new scriptwriter will cure the flaws."
2,"Looked cool, fell flat","This is one of the few graphic novels that will actually have to have the plot filled out in order for it to be made into a film. It goes by so fast you're left feeling that you've read a synopsis of a much better, larger story. The artwork is dark and interesting but sometimes so murky that I had trouble distinguishing who I was looking at and who was attacking whom. I'm curious to see what the sequel will hold."
4,Good book.,I like this book very much. I love how the book was written and the main topic. The only thing I disliked was the illustrations. They were ok but I wish the illustrater would've put more detail in the pictures.
2,"Some plus, some minue","I got this book with the expectation of being whelmed. That didn't happen. The premise is great, the artwork interesting...but, overall, I was left feeling pretty ho-hum about the whole thing. The story is rushed, in an attempt to create suspense (at least I hope that's the reason); but there isn't any depth to it and, although I don't mind that two of the characters have no apparent meaning in the story development (a lot of time/space is wasted to get on of them in postition to provide the vampires with an alibi), I do mind what happens in the climax when the sherrif finds himself able to destroy the vampires simply because he 'finds his rhythm'. It's difficult to recommend this book. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't that notable either."
1,Horrid,"30 Days of Night? Try 30 minutes... That's how long it took me to read the thing and that's how long I thought the story took in real time. The writing is awful. The first scene with the sun setting made me want to puke because it was obviously trying to get the reader to care about the two main characters, but ends up making you feel indifferent.The plot is just re-hashed Hollywood horror from George Romero to Dracula movies. Scary? Not even close. While the art seems to be well done it does not lend it self to story-telling at all. I was straining my eyes looking at the panels trying figure out what just happened and who it happened to.I heard they were making a movie out of this mess. They would be best advised to pull the plug on it now."
1,is this for 12yr olds??,"I was in the library today and happened to notice a book in the young adults section called ""30 days of night."" The library staff person on duty told me the young adults section was for 13-18 yr olds and that this book was targeted toward the 12-14 yr old range. I flipped through the book and was shocked at the level of graphic violence and dialog. I opened to a random page and saw the ""F"" word. The scenes of blood and gore were disturbing.I'm 29 yrs old and I like vampire stories in general. I'm not against the library having this book but I was stunned to find that this book was openly available to kids under 17. If the pictures in the book were on film instead of in print it would easily get an R rating. In my opinion this is adult material and should not be targeting kids."
1,This is a comic Book,"Unless you know the author of this type of books, You are not made aware that this is not a novel, it is a comic book."
2,I'll take the pamphlet,The good news about this book is that it does provide the reader with some good insight about slot machines. The bad news is that the information it contains would fit inside a pamphlet and the rest of the book is filled with lame jokes and enough cliched one liners to fill a dozen cancelled sit-coms.
3,"Steeleye Span, a Fine Celtic Band","I find it hard to think of this record as being by Steeleye Span. Without the soaring vocals of Maddy Prior (to borrow another reviewer's phrase) it just doesn't sound like da Span. That said, The songs are interesting and Gay Woods is a fine Irish singer. The CD is well worth the replaying and the arrangements are quite intriguing. I found the Lord Randall to be the best version of that old turkey I've ever listened to."
5,"Great piano ,sophisticated lyrics passionate vocals!!","A refreshing variety of music in the pop genre. Two favorites are ""Tell Me"",and ""Go down to the river"". Tell me has the plaintive theme of a troubled love which reflects real life. Go down to the river has great rhythm."
1,Does not meet the hype,"The title is very misleading. Remember that this book has not been updated since 1998, so unless you are looking to buy a car older than '98 this is really not a ""buyer's guide"". It has good coverage of Mercedes historically, so if you want to know about the various models from a collectors point of view this book would be appropriate, if you are in the market for a current model Mercedes ('98-'01) do not waste your time with this book."
2,Firm hold but top rolls down!,"I have a surgical hernia just to the right of my belly button and need firm support so I purchased this item. It does hold very firm, but the top rolled down almost instantly after I put it on and when I wear it there is a good 2 inches rolled over my belt and waist of my pants. Also the plastic boning comes down too far and digs into my hips on both sides."
3,Hard to put on,I am a stroke survivor and the binder is hard for me to put on due to my left side weakness
3,Binder is Ok,"It was a little too wide for me, bound when I sat down. I need one that is shorter from to chest"
3,"beautiful, but",it is very thin.. I was expecting a heavier chain.. It's not really heavy enough to use for a pendant unless it is a very small one..
5,Just as beautiful as the title says,"If you like Peter Koelewijn, or would like to know him, this is the perfect cd for you! It contains his best tracks. All the popular are on this cd and even some less known songs, which made me positive surprised as I thought I knew quite a lot of his songs. All in a great quality. One of my favourites cd's. And they don't lie when they call it ""Het Mooiste Van Peter Koelewijn"" - it really contains the most beautiful songs..."
1,Dont get this rip-off,"if you love blink-182 you wont get this piece. its just freakin ""blink-182 punk poets"" ripped off and given a different box. literally the dvd menu says ""punk poets"" and everything just like the other dvd by that title. seriously this is the biggest disappointment ever. the freaking music isnt even blink 182. DONT BUY THIS. YOU WILL REGRET IT."
5,Harry James in his prime,"I've played trumpet since the fall of 1976 and while I knew of Harry James while in school his music wasn't available as much as it is today. Many of the live on air cuts are now being released. Thanks to Harry's longtime manager Pee Wee Monte and his wife much of his great music is now available. I'm not sure if these tracks are from the Monte's archives but they show first hand this band in it's Heyday.I rediscovered Harry James in 1991 and have collected much of his music. Helen Forrest was the""Queen"" of all female vocalists of this era. Air checks are about all that is available in this time frame due to the musicians union strike around this time. This is a great live recording."
4,Printed in Italy...,...and the quality reflects it.This book has a lot of very good pictures of both interior and exterior of boats that were built without budgets.
1,Stinks worst than a skunk!,"I think this book was pretty bad. There was many unrealistic situations and the book was boring. The main conflict in the book is dragged all the way to the end of the book and it is very sloppy how it is 'finished'. I think the only thing this book is good for is being a paperweight, a wedge, and also coaster."
1,"Overdone, trite -- disappointing","The title pretty much says it all. I enjoyed ""Bean Trees"" enough that I was pleased to find a sequel. What a disappointment! I found the plot twists unbelievable and most of the characters trite.What really bothered me was the book seemed to be a hymn to political correctness. There seemed to be a representative of virtually every possible type of person, whether their characters were believable or not. I grew truly disgusted with Taylor's brief relationship with the man in the wheelchair -- that seemed especially tokenistic. I have no problem with any of these things in a book, but they have to be woven in to the plot properly, not just pulled out of a hat and arranged.Overall, read ""Animal Dreams"" if you want Kingsolver, not this."
2,Historically inaccurate,"I was disappointed in the book because of its many historical inacuracies and its distortion of current Cherokee life and culture.Having grown up and lived my whole life (68 years) in Eastern Oklahoma, known many Cherokees, and spent many years studying their history and culture, I found the book full of disappointing stereotypes. I expected better from Kingsolver, especially since the Cherokees are among the most thoroughly researched and written about of the Native Americans.The story should be regarded as simply a fairy tale with no relationship to real life.I give it two stars only because Kingsolver tells a good story even when it is just a fairy tale."
3,Read the book just for fun,"An easy to read and enjoyable book but nothing to knock your socks off. The book moved along and kept my interest. It must be read with the idea that it is fiction, almost a fable, because there is a lot in this book that is pretty unbelievable. For example, the coincidence of relationships among the characters, the highly romanticized vision of family and life on the reservation, the lack of forethought and wisdom of the main character on the run with her daughter and the everything neatly tied together ending. This book certainly delves into social issues pertinent to our times and does give pause for thought but is disappointing with respect to these issues because of the ending. Read the book for fun."
3,The sequal to 'Bean Trees' is flat by comparison,"Like Kingsolver's previous novel starring Taylor and Turtle, Pigs in Heaven crams a lot of humor, happiness and bizarre plot twists into virtually every page. This makes it an entertaining read, but many times it seems as if Kingsolver is trying too hard. In an attempt to create more of the disordered splendor found in 'Bean Trees' she has gone way overboard. Characters are introduced as though through a revolving door; as soon as you become interested in them they are whisked off the pages. Annawake is boringly typical as the exuberent protector of sacred native life, as is Jaxs in his unreasonable devoted/unfaithful relationship with Taylor. Like many sequels, Pigs in Heaven fails to capture the essential element of its predecessing novel. The charachters from 'Bean Trees' were all there, but the zany, endearing spirit was not."
4,GGGRRREEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATTTTTTTTTTTTT!!!!!!!,"I really enjoyed this book. Barbara Kingsolver is a wonderful author and I can't wait to read more of her books. I was a little disapointed with the ending, but it was an overall success in my mind. I especially recommend this book and ""The Bean Trees"" (also by the author) to highschoolers who are discovering their identities."
2,A Heavenly Mother-Daughter Relationship,"Pigs in Heaven was an interesting book. At times it was slow, but for the most part Kingsolver was able to keep her readers' attention. Overall, I liked the book. I felt that Taylor and Turtle's relationship was a very solid mother-daughter relationship that I hope to have with my mother one day. I felt that the trust between Alice and Taylor was also a very crucial part of the book. Without that, Taylor may have been on the run forever, while only hurting bot herself and Turtle in doing so. I also found Cash's love of Alice to be something very special, something that Alice seemed to be longing for for more years than I can imagine. This gave me a comfort in knowing that while separated from Taylor, even if for only a few short months a year, that Turtle would be safe and loved unconditionally. In the end, I found Pigs in Heaven to be an excellent example of love and strength that everyone should have the opportunity to experience at least once in a lifetime."
4,kudos to pigs in heaven,"I still have not read its prequel The Bean Trees,but Pigs in Heaven is a good book all alone.It focuses on Taylor Greer engaged in a tug-of-war with the Cherokee nation to keep her illegally adopted Cherokee daughter Turtle.Great imagery and character description,like with Taylor's boyfriend Jax and Cherokee lawyer Annawake Fourkiller.A beautiful story."
4,a mother and child chase and face book.,"Barbara Kingsolver has a tremendous insight for delivering a story of true meaning. Her ability to write characters so well is amazing. She is the embodiment of what a writer should be doing with their writing. In Pigs in Heaven, she once again delivers her normal brillance with her renown twist of moral. She continues to impress me more and more with her flirtatious means of storytelling. Four stars."
5,Altogether a fabulous book!,"When a librarian suggested I try this book, I had no idea that I would get so much out of it. Wow! Most people who reviewed it said that it was really unimaginable that all the characters could be connected. This happens to me all the time. The only problem I had with the book was that I found it unimaginable that Taylor and Turtle would stay in such a dismal situation for so long and not even try to come home. Anyway, this is definitely worth your time."
3,Not my favorite Kingsolver book,"Not my favorite Kingsolver book, but it's a nice story about a white woman's adoption of an Indian child. The purpose seemed to be to explain the Indian Child Welfare Act, but I found much of it hard to understand."
2,It Could have Been Better-I'm Not Sure about Kingsolver!,"After reading this sequel to The Bean Trees, I found it a bit better, but still, it bored me. I just don't think I care for Kingsolver's style of writing.Taylor's daughter Turtle was adopted illegally and the adversary, a female attorney Annawake, wants to contest the adoption, and put Turtle back with her indian blood kin where she feels she belongs.The whole story focuses on this issue, and I just found it monotonous to say the least. There are other more worthwhile books to read for sure!!"
4,JAXXXXXXX!,"I am very taken with Turtle, Taylor, Alice, Cash, and Annawake. I felt much closer to Taylor in TBT, probably because it was written in first person and I liked that much better. I loved Alice and Cash's love thing and Annawake's bitter, mourning feelings about losing her brother (though I wish we could have seen her interact with him), but my favorite parts in the book were with JAX!He's so funny and tragic. He's not even mentioned in most of the reviews. I thought I'd read about someone who felt the exact same way. Oh well. I probably would have given Pigs in Heaven 5 stars if Kingsolver had just shown us Jax at the end of the book."
1,A waste of precious time...,I agree with the customer who thought this book was under developed and thought the characters were one demensional! I felt so cheated by sticking through with this book. It read like a ridiculous soap opera - with events happening that were so contrived and unrealistic. I even think that the writing was below par - pure dribble.
2,This book is better read if your a female,"I felt this book was decent for the most part. Being a male reader I had a difficult time reading Kingsolver constantly trash men, which is one of her big themes in this book. Unless your a good interpretive reader, I suggest you skip this one. Kingsolver uses alot of metaphors and unless you are able to connect and understand them you won't get the full aspect of the book. I suggest that only women buy this book, since men will be disgusted with Kingsolvers continuous male bashing. Not only that but this has no plot whatsoever, its all relationship and dialogue, Another words, skip this novel and choose something a little more interesting."
2,Pigs in Heaven not very heavenly,"Pigs in Heaven starts out well, but then we get dragged through the emotional mud of 2 women who can't relate to others in a healthy way. As the reader, I couldn't relate to or sympathize with either charachter. Kingsolver deals with Indian American issues as they pertain to adotion and slams everyone from adoptive parents to Mormons in the process! She tries to tie it all together with a happy ending that is far-fetched and just a little too easy. She wants to tackle major social issues and then turn it in to a happily-ever-after and I just didn't buy it. Not one of her better books."
2,Unrealistic Characters,"I was fairly disappointed by ""Pigs In Heaven."" I was expecting much deeper writing, rather than the simplistic, primative style that Kingsolver adopts for this novel. Furthermore, I found the characters far too ideal; they were very unrealistic. It seemed as though Kingsolver had a very good plot and well drawn characters going for her until she decided to round off the corners and sand everything down. The book also came to a close far too neatly for my taste."
4,Pigs In Heaven by B. Kingsolver,"Pigs In Heaven is a wonderful book and I enjoyed every page. However, I encountered many typos - especially in the last 50 pages or so. Some were not so easy to decipher even using context clues. The kindle edition needs further editing!"
3,Good summer read,"I picked up this book while staying at my Aunt's house. I needed a book and found this one in her collection. So I didn't read Bean Tree's first. Maybe I would have liked the book more if I would have read Bean Tree first. The book didn't grab my attention until about the third chapter. I found the book nteresting but somewhat unbelievable. The Native American aspect of the book was intriguing. An alright read, but nothing to rave about"
2,Try Another,"This is my first Kingsolver novel and frankly, I was not impressed. Though it is well-written, it did not hold my attention. Unrealistic characers, contrived plot, and comical situations made me struggle to finish it. I'll have to try another book."
2,"Very unrealistic storyline, and downhill from there","With 250+ millions of human beings in the whole US of A, what a fortuitous coincidence that all these people are connected via cousin Sugar. Unbelievable. And then how convenient that Alice and Cash fall for each other! There are supermarket paperback romances with sturdier storylines! I enjoyed the moral questions that Kingsolver raises, but the vehicle to express these issues is quite poor. I think _Animal Dreams_ is a million times better, and _The Poisonwood Bible_ a trillion times better."
3,Nothing like what I thought,"Ho hum. I thought the plot to this novel was interesting, but the writing was boring. I read this before I read ""The Poisonwood Bible"", and almost didn't read ""Bible"" because I was so bored by this one. Mediocre at best. ""The Poisonwood Bible"" puts this book to shame!"
4,A must for any adopted child,"If you are adopted or have an adopted child, this book is the best I have read which shows clearly the two opposing sides in an almost perfectly balance. At the beginning of the book, relatives of Turtle's biological family find out about her and try to take her back, while of course her mother is doing all that she can to keep her child. This is every adopted kid's nightmare and fantasy at the same time--that ""the people"" will come and take you away. Both sides are painted very fairly but it will be an emotional read for anyone who has lived through it."
5,Loved the book,"Loved the book! The editing errors were a distraction. I thought the ending was abrupt, but satisfactory. This sequel was a good conclusion for The Bean Tree."
4,Inspiring through the fantastic,"I have seen many harsh reviews of this book, but as someone who read it in the midst of a comprehensive survey of Native American literature, which lasted for two years, I must speak out in favor of Barbara Kingsolver's bravery in using levity, and at times, almost fantastic twists of fate to represent her Native and Euro-American characters as equally flawed, and equally open to the forces that rule the universe. I enjoy Kingsolver's use of the ""small world theory"" in bringing Alice and Cash together as much as I enjoy her realism in pitting Annawake and Taylor against one another. I think that her ability to mix serious topics with simple human interest is unique and compelling. This novel, in my opinion, was a worthy follow up to ""The Bean Trees,"" a masterpiece of contemporary American literature."
2,Unrealistic and a bit dull,"I had to read this book for my english class. Although the book did have some high points, it seemed very unrealistic (too many things happened coincidently and the characters' reactions were a bit unbelievale). The only reason I gave it 2 stars is beccause of the unique writing style."
2,interesting info on Cherokee Nation but writing labored,"the author tried too hard to be a clever writer and it came across as a labored style; the story itself was somewhat unrealistic but I did enjoy learning about the life style of the Cherokee Nation in Oklahoma, especially since I had lived in Atlanta and heard about the Cherokee's forced deportation"
2,An excellent example of a completely over-rated book...,"Barbara Kingsolver's book is noble in the fact that she tries to shed light on an important social issue, but it was simplistically written. Metaphors and smilies are beautiful when well written, but Mrs. Kingsolver abuses and misuses them. Its unfortunate that the author wrote this book at the expense of an issue like the Indian Child Welfare Act."
4,"Different from fist book, but good","Pigs in heaven is different from the first novel where me meet taylor and Turtle, but a great and easy read. Interesting story."
3,Good but not terrific,"In this book Ms Kingsolver discusses some compelling ""new-age"" issues--preference for being a single versus permanently-coupled mother; love after age 60. However, she brings on way too many characters without developing them fully, which tends to muddle the story line. I have no idea why the author dedicated so much time to Barbie, who finally disappears.Yet the story and three main characters--Turtle, Taylor, and her mother--are believable and we keep our fingers crossed for them, just as Anawake is a young and meddling lawyer-nuisance whom we wish would grow up."
3,it was a nice insight into Cherokee culture,"I just finished ""Pigs in Heaven"" on audio tape. It was a pretty good followup to ""The Bean Trees."" The same woman read both books, which was nice. Though not told completely from Taylor's point of view, as was ""The Bean Trees,"" it's nice to hear her familiar voice thoughout the tapes.My only complaint was the relationship between Taylor and Jax. She was never home long enough for us to get an understanding of the relationship. So much of what we saw was conducted long distance, that I didn't really accept how their relationship ended up.Otherwise, it was a nice insight into Cherokee culture. The story is a continuation of the lives of Taylor and Turtle. Because of a highly publicized incident at Hoover Dam, the two end up on the run from authorities who are trying to return Turtle to her native Cherokee people.Fate has a hand in their lives as they both grow to learn of their heritage."
2,schizophrenic charm,"Numan's dance trend reaches scattered heights in the disco-tronic 80's. Confusion and perhaps blatant redundancy cloud whatever direction Numan is trying to approach in the post-modern era. A river patrol to sax highlighted dance floors perhaps....however, the schizophrenic ""Strange Charm"" yields 3 classics in ""My Breathing"", ""The Sleeproom"" and ""Time To Die"". Strange in the fact that Time To Die was left off the first pressing of this CD. Even more strange is that it was only available on cassette. Did anyone still buy 45's in the mid 80's? Strange Charm indeed.olofpalme63"
3,Atmospheric,"This isn't my least favorite Gary Numan album (that's MACHINE & SOUL) but I never found this one too compelling. My problems with this album were thrown into focus when I read that Gary Numan more or less had ideas for the album, but never really brought them into sharp focus. That explained a lot - the album has a tense, forboding atmosphere, but nothing really to hang the atmosphere on. Sort of a Gary Numan environmental album. There are several highlights - ""My Breathing"" was deservedly singled out for praise (the hook'll stay with you for days), and ""I Can't Stop"" plays with rhythm and lyrics in interesting ways. The bonus track ""Time to Die"" is a rare ballad that comes together quite nicely. Except for the ""longer-versions-of-what-you've-already-heard"", the bonus tracks are actually a very welcome addition, with some instrumental work that actually enhances the feeling of the album. Maybe not an essential Gary Numan purchase, but certainly no embarassment."
1,reallly crappy scissors,"I thought since they were ""scotch"" brand scissors they'd be at least acceptable for wrapping presents, instead they stick and are hard to open and close. Spend a few bucks and get a better pair."
4,decent everyday-use scissors,"These scissors are good for everyday use; they are not superior cutting shears, but they are nice and big and are perfect for general purposes, such as construction paper, etc. Price is right, too."
3,OK,"These scissors are OK - but they're not as good as the ones we got at the dollar store. You get what you pay for, sometimes."
3,"Good Book, but took a while to get into the story line","This was a good book, but I agree with the previous reviewer comments about the book being slow paced."
3,Okay book,"The book was okay. I was kind of dissapointed that i actually bought the book, which I borrowed it from the library."
2,Not Jacquelin's Best!,"The previous reviews here have already done a pretty good job of presenting the synopsis of this novel. Therefore I don't see the need to rehash on that. However, unfortunately, I didn't find this novel as appealing as the others.It took me almost two weeks to finish this book. That was mainly because I couldn't get into it and the first 2/3 of the book was prolonged with empty chattering and had me questioning the purpose of it all. When the plot finally developed towards the end it was rather rushed and the overall tone of the book had sort of a fairy-tale theme - ""Once upon a time...and they all lived happily ever after"".I was greatly disappointed with the book. I have read other Christian-based novels by Jacquelin and this is definitely not her best."
3,Very slow-paced,"This book moved incredibly slow. I started flipping through until something caught my eye. Also, the 3 main ladies: Macy, Patterson, and LaRue, all seemed to be missing a dimension. I could not relate to them at all."
3,Thank You for Being My Friend,"Once upon a time there were three girls...Macy is a native of NYC. She's a spoiled brat and after getting in some trouble her parents decide that it's time for her to make it on her own.Patterson is a Georgian and a strict Christian. She'll meet obstacle after obstacle as she tries to adapt to big city living.LaRue is a Californian who's harboring a lot of hurt. Though she's been told that she looks like a model, it's late in her life that she decides to make a go for it without following God.I found this book to be a very good read because not only was it refreshing, but it was also very inspirational. Three strangers with a common goal develop into friends."
3,Underwhelming,"I came to TU via Natacha Atlas, who's solo work I like - this has some great tracks, but overall isn't memorable."
5,From a reader in N.Y...a book that touched my heart,"This is a extremely well written book that is sensitive,feeling and very moving. If you have ever lost someone you loved dearly this book will touch your heart and soul...it is poignant, intuitive, filled with humor and honesty...its fluidity of style and grace make it a wonderfully easy read....I adored every minute of it."
4,An Exciting Lady,I read this book in one day. What a life. If only the racing personalities of today could be so colorful. Instead we get a bunch of men spout the same old corporate jargon. Helle Nice could not only raced cars she lived life to the fullest.
4,i Ay Que Bueno!,This is definitely one of the best Latin House CD's out there! I can't even take it out of my CD player! BAILA! BAILA!:)
3,"Nice, sweet...","He has everything money can buy - except a wife!Confronted with Andreas Karydis, Sophy is convinced arrogance is a Karydis family trait! Wealth, power, devastating looks - no wonder Andreas has women falling at his feet...Spending the summer at his Greek home, Sophy is relieved when Andreas insists on separate rooms. Only, then she discovers why he doesn't want her as his mistress - he wants her as his bride!This is a sweet book. Andreas seems genuinely to like Sophy and is such a decent human being. She is a career woman, not by any means a simpering, wimpy girl who gets dragged around by the whims of the man she is attracted to. Although, the actual courting is virtually cut out of the story, Andreas declares his feelings soon enough and that is certainly always refreshing."
3,"Flying High With ""Boys""","WHEN BOYS FLY is an intriguing and entertaining look into the sub-culture of the Circuit Party scene. The film pulls no punches as it follows various young(and some not-so-young) men as they delve into the fun, the danger, and the debauchery that is all-too prevalent in the annual bacchanal held in Miami Beach. Like most parties, the merriment comes with a price, and in the case of the party-hearty revellers presented here, it is a price they are all-too willing to pay."
1,when boys fly,"I have viewed a lot of great gay films, when boys fly is not one of them i will not be passing on to friends"
5,Watch this one...and walk through the looking glass,"I found the documentary ""When Boys Fly"" to be a surprisingly engaging and fascinating, candid, shocking and sometimes sad peek through the looking glass to see what really goes on at ""gay raves,"" aka circuit parties. Filmmakers Rolov and Halpern did a great job in showing us the world in which this segment of so-called ""A-listers"" live and party, and how some newcomers and White party veterans are drawn into the circle of rave party life and its immediate results...good and bad. The quick editing makes for a fast-paced viewing and humor is where you might not always expect to find it in this honest and non-judgemental portrayal of this subculture within a subculture that I believe can be enjoyed by gay and straight, young-to-middle-aged audiences alike."
5,A Must See!,"An incredible documentary that takes a hard look at the gay circuit party scene. Funny and sobering, witty and truthful, edgy and insightful. Simply fantsastic."
2,Boo to the rescue cozy coupe,"All over the coupe where the molds met up, the plastic sticks out and creates a sharp and dangerous edge. My husband spent a lot of time with a razor shaving down these sharp spots. Also, one part of the molded plastic did not match up because the mold was a bit off so that was a huge pain trying to force the pieces to fit. We purchased the cozy coupe because I have seen many still around after 8 or ten years but I can not imagine this one lasting nearly that long. The plastic is a lot thinner than the good ol' days. (And I'm only 25!)My son does love his coupe but this is the third Little Tikes product I have had a problem with so we will be sticking to Step 2 for plastic molded items from now on.To summarize, if you have ever handled an older cozy coupe, this item is less durable, awful to assemble, but still fun for the kids."
5,Great toy!,This toy as well as the regular coupe are great toys for toddlers. They are always the most desirable toys that my daughter and her friends play with when they are together. We had to buy two so that there would be one for my daughter and one for when her friends come over. They have so much fun!
2,"May work, or, may slowly destroy your Zen Vision M","While this does indeed recharge the Creative Vision:M MP3 player, it is likely responsible for slowly cooking my Zen.My experience:Number one, when the Zen is plugged into this adapter, the touch pad becomes useless. unplug it, and you can use the touch pad again.Number two, I eventually wound up replacing the touch pad.Number three, a slight audible hum can be heard while listening to music with the Zen plugged in.Number four, My Zen began to need constant resetting and restarting after years of good performance. Eventually it became unuseable. I ordered a new battery, thinking that was a possible cause, and when I opened up the Zen to replace the battery, i noticed corrosion and heat damage both on the metal of the power supply and all around the power supply on the circuit board. I belive this adapter is responsible."
3,It does what it does,"It does what it does, which is charge the Zen Vision M quicker than the USB cable would, but it also causes a loud buzzing in the headphones while charging, making it impossible to listen to music while charging the unit.My best guess is its cheaply shielded and it's electromagnetic noise. I've tried solutions to no avail so buy if you must, but I suggest a higher quality charger."
5,Lovely Book,"This book was a gift to me from the author himself, a generous man with a big heart. Wonderful quotes that sweeten your soul! Highly recommend!! Now!!!"
5,This book rocked,"This book tells all about Jason Kidd, you know legendery Dallas Maverick now a Sun that player, well the book tells all about his life and carreer goals (achieved)"
5,Highly Recommended.......Very Entertaining,"I have had the pleasure of seeing this band perform live at the Sweet Oregon Grill in Hillsboro, Oregon. Their style is very entertaining and fun. I highly recommend their newest release ""Dream Cemetary""."
