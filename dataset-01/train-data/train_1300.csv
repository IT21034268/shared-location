3,Makes good juice.,"Squeezes lemons and small fruit okay, but it would be nice to have a larger size just designed for oranges."
5,Sturdy,So far works like a champ! Don't feel like you are going to break it at the hinge. Always good idea to roll limes first tho to soften them a little.
3,handle bends easily,"I bent the handle the first time I used it. Now I have bent it back and I have to hold it close to where it squeezes or the handle will bend again. It works well though, gets every drop out. I'm not sure what kind of stainless steel it is but it's not professional as stated on the box. Made in China."
1,"Might serve as a good grape press, but.....",".....it's definitely not sturdy enough for frequent use on lemons or limes. After just a few squeezes the handle bends to the point where it will no longer completely extract all of the juice. In fact, in order to effectively squeeze out all the juice, it's necessary to, after squeezing the first lemon pile a second lemon on top of the first and squeeze again. It takes three limes to achieve the same result. The handle can be bent back into position, of course, but that only lasts a few squeezes and then it's back to bending again. It's hard to count the number of times over the two years or so I've owned it that I've had to mount the thing in a vise and bend the handle back to where it should be.PLEASE, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT IF YOU ACTUALLY EXPECT IT TO WORK!"
4,Citrus Press,"This is an excellent product. I am a little arthritic, but find it easy to use due to the weight and balance. Using thin skinned lemons makes them easier to squeeze, however. Also, no need to separate pulp and seeds from the juice.I would highly recommend this citrus press - good value.Sue from Ohio"
5,Awesome juicer,"My primary reason for purchasing this juicer was for squeezing limes to make margaritas. I had been squeezing key limes by hand which took forever to get the amount of juice needed. This press saves an enormous amount of time and pain. One quick squeeze gets every last drop of juice out of the limes. I have started to use it for bigger limes and lemons and it continues to work great.The stainless steel construction feels solid, much better than some of the cheaper plastic ones I have seen, and the handles allow you to get plenty of leverage. The higher price was definitely worth the quality of the product.In case you buy this just to make margaritas like I did, here is a simple recipe to get you started:4 parts tequila2 parts triple sec1 part mexican key lime juice1 part simple syrup (2 cups sugar dissolved into 1 cup boiling water, then cooled)"
5,My Main Squeeze,"This citrus press gets every last drop out of a lemon or lime, in just one good squeeze. And no electricity needed! Easy to clean (including dishwasher safe)."
1,rip off,can i get my money and postage back...... not what i expected.... the 12L does not match the few 12L I have already so I wonder if you all really sent me the right size. It would cost me more to send back than the screws are worth but if you want to refund my money go ahead.
5,Great clock!,"I bought this clock to take with me on a cruise last month. I have a HORRIBLE time waking up in the dark (as in - it doesn't happen)! The amount to upgrade to a cabin with a window (just so I would know when it was morning) was about $300 per person. I decided to give this little clock a try for less than $100 and I'm glad I did! I was able to stay in an ""inside"" cabin, set the alarm, and easily wake up to a warmly lit room every morning. It worked like a charm and I'll definitely be using it every morning once daylight savings time is over with!I guess you could say this clock saved me $600!!! ;)"
1,Sad,"I find it so sad that people can justify almost anythng under the name of god. The person writing this book is just that - a person. Because he's written a book, this seems to make it ok to beat our children. You can call it spanking or any other name but you are still hitting someone you supposedly love. To say nothing of the humiliation to our children. He holds court in his house, to make sure things remain fair. Will he except it when he's made a mistake and his children tell him to drop his pants, lay on his stomach and beat him with a paddle."
1,pass on it.,"The book is not w/o some good points,but the descriptions of cruel disciple with religious overtones,in the James Dobson tradition,vitiates against any positive value the book may have.It is also much too anecdotal in nature,and its parenting prescriptions do not take into account the fact that a child have have special needs or undiagnosed mental health problems."
4,Sharing Life together in the Family,"Smalley's book on parenting, ""The Key to your Child's Heart"" invites parents to share life together with their kids, heart to heart, at the daily, emotional and spiritual level of life. His over-indulgence in lists (84 ways, 4 basic types, 2 factors, 3 powerful ways, 19 ways, 6 characteristics) cheapens the material in this book in my opinion. But Smalley had condensed into this volume a wise perspective on parenting and dozens of practical ideas for improving your family life.Also recommended--THE FAMILY CLOISTER: BENEDICTINE WISDOM FOR THE HOME, by David Robinson (New York: Crossroad, 2000, 192pp., trade paperback)."
2,Carribbean London,"Music is OK, but does not sound professional. I guess you need sunshine and palm trees to make steel drums sound authentic."
5,They're just fine to me!,"I've read several reviews stating that the Emerald nuts are too salty or stale. I received my shipment yesterday and have been very pleased with them. I can see where they would be too salty for some folks, but I think the walnuts and pecans, by virtue of shape, will collect more salt than the almonds or cashews. Overall great quality."
1,VERY SALTY!,"Disappointed. These Emerald Deluxe Mixed Nuts are coated with too much salt. The nuts themselves are fine but I couldn't eat anymore after only a couple of them. So very salty. Not wanting to waste them by throwing them away, I ended up dumping them on a sieve and shake the salt out to lessen the salty taste. YUCK! I wouldn't buy it again."
3,too salty,The deluxe nuts were good because there were no peanuts; lots of cashews and almonds. But they were a little too salty.
2,Good movie terrible reproduction,"This Roc Tien movie has the makings of being a class A martial Arts film except for the reproduction and quality of the DVD its totally unviewable. The movie go's into black about five minutes into it, I rate this movie with a 2 because you can't see nothing at all after it blacks out. I wish I could have gotten a good copy this film is wrought having in your library."
1,Silly and outdated,"The idea that socialism and communism is a monolithic plot by the wealthy is just silly, especially after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the general retreat from the social safety net seen in the English speaking world since the 1970s and 1980s. If Wilson wanted communism, why would he send in troops to fight with the white Russians? If you want to read about what the elite really wants, read Noam Chomsky (Manufacturing Consent, What Uncle Sam Really Wants, The Prosperous Few and the Restless Many, all are excellent and convincing.) And watch ""Bulworth"" and ""Bob Roberts."" Gary Allen is about as worth listening to as Lyndon LaRouche. Some might find all this conspiracy stuff amusing, but for that you could read the ""Illuminatus Trilogy"" by Robert Anton Wilson. In short, save your money."
4,True facts on hidden powers behind the White House,"In politics, nothing happens by accident. This is an incredible true statement from Mr. F. D. Roosvelt.This book re-oriented some concerns I had on North American Government effectiveness on foreign affairs.Really a pleasant reading.The best, is that you have the right to believe or not what the author of this book says.ENJOY THE READING !"
5,blockbuster,Everybody should read this book. There is a lot of valuable information concerning the direction our country is being taken starting in the early 1900's.
5,Fast shipping and exactly as described,Thank you for sending the book so quickly - it arrived within a couple of days of ordering it.
3,Amusing,"I loved this book when I read it as a teenager. It was very amusing. It told a fantastic story of a world that was completely and totally organized, quite unlike the world in which we actually live. I think that the author should have put in some UFO's and a Yeti or two to make it more realistic. I give it 5 stars for the fantasy component and 1 star for the reality component. That averages to 3 stars."
5,Feel Better!,"At the very least, I feel better 90 of us have read this stuff. I live in a state of paranoia. Catholics! now you know!"
3,If only it were this simple...,"This book paints with broad strokes, unforgivable generalizations and too many Carroll Quigley quotes. The simple fact is that to know FOR SURE that the Rothschilds, Rockefellers, etc. are actually sinister, evil families, an entire objective book and documented investigation would need to be dedicated to them -- to the point that the author would interview the family members, surveil them, document their whereabouts and activites over years, interview their friends, and document their financial dealings. Such a task would require years of dedication, something the authors of this book were not capable of. I would recommend ""A Fearful Master"", circa 1964 I believe, over this book. -- J.R., redstone@sedona.net"
5,READ THIS BOOK - One of the most important books ever written,"I cannot possibly recommend this book highly enough. The book was written about 40 years ago and details the rise to power, especially in the US, of the banking elite, and how they have planned and worked to seize control of this country - and the world. In light of the events of the past 10 years particularly, it has become obvious that we no longer live in an open democracy, but in a plutocracy controlled by mega multinational corporations and the super rich class that owns them...and manipulates us. ""None Dare Call It Conspiracy"" will explain in a cogent, concise manner, of why no matter who we elect - Bush or Obama - things DON'T change, and only Wall St and the corporations flourish. There really IS a plan to all this and it's quite simply...a class war.READ THIS BOOK. If there is no other book you read for the rest of your life....MAKE IT THIS ONE. You will never view our country and the world the same way again."
5,None Dare Call It Conspiracy,"Excellent book for an introduction into what is really going on behind the scenes in politics as well as some history of how the Federal Reserve came into being and the results.A short history of the Bolshevik Revolution, who funded it, and who funded the Soviet Union is included. It is an eye opening book!"
4,Excellent Tool,"It is always a little challenging to review very simple items like this, but as with other Marshalltown tools I own, the quality and finish is good, and the tool is well proportioned. I wouldn't hesitate to purchase this item again, although for my purposes, I might opt for the 1-1/2 inch model next time. However, that is simply a matter of personal preference, the two inch version I bought is quite satisfactory. I think you will be pleased with this tool in either size."
1,"Does not work, No Customer Support","I purchased this item and attempted to use it on a 2004 Ford Freesar. It would not work. Programmed for one start only each time, following the directions explicitly.And good luck if You need to reach their customer/tech support centerDo Yourself a favor and purchase code alarm (audiovox) or other audiovox brand (flash logic)For $5 or $8 more, it will be worth it.I can not believe the time I have wasted with Direct Electronics products."
1,Not worth it.,"This ""study guide"" is simply a summary of the story. As a teacher, I did not find any really useful information or helpful material to use in my classroom."
4,GREAT ATMOSPHERE,"The best thing about ""If You Could See Me Now"" is the eerie, dream-like atmosphere that Straub builds from the very beginning. It contains so many weird, quirky goings-on before any ""supernatural"" elements are introduced, I kept thinking to myself as I was reading, ""No way that just happened!""The plot surprises are effective, too. Straub baits you along for practically half the book before revealing even ONE of the surprise mysteries. The ending is a good twist, too.I liked Ghost Story, but this book made me a bona fide Peter Straub fan."
4,"Not a King, more like a cunning wizard...","I thought mr Straub was something like a second King, since they have even co-operated, but after reading this book I changed my mind. King is a fantasy writer, fond of epic sagas in the black-and-white vein, whereas Straub weaves his story of more complex stuff. Somehow this is like a detective story, but there is the dark supernatural element as well. A powerful and very intensive story, which reaches beyond the usual standards of horror fiction."
1,I don't agree with the other reviewers,"I was not convinced. Having tried Mr. X (it had such a ""must have"" look about it) and found it seriously wanting, again the main character is not persuasive enough. He actually sounds like a complete jerk. Maybe it would have been more convincing written in third person but as is.......... Not as bad as Mr. X which was a total dissapointment but definititely much ado about very little!"
3,its OKK,i read this book for usmle prep...it was pretty good...but had way too much information for usmle 1....i would reccomend using FA's embryo section as a guide...and read only sections in high yield that are represented in first aid(FA)...over all decent book...but overkill for usmle 1...
3,Not the best book,"This book is ok to study for USMLE step 1, but not fantastic. There is not much background information or explanation, and the images are ok but not very good. I would have liked it to give a bit more information on some processes, a little more background and a bit more help to understand and memorize important subjects. It does give a lot of clinical information, but not in a way that makes it very easy to memorize.So if I could choose again, I would go with another book. This is not a bad book, but not very good either."
5,Good book,That is very good book i love it everything is very clear in this book i recommend this book for the those students to become for usmle step 1
4,good book,Great book for cliff notes version of the embryology book I use for class. It is straight and to the point
3,skimable,"i skimmed through this book for my step 1 because some of its contents not necessary or were found in other books such as high yiel histo or anatomy and first aid.good to skim through for the boards, but if u dont have time first aid is a perfect alternate.Even if you decide to use this book, dont use it alone, use it with first aid, which was what i did. i ended up making a 229/95 in my step 1."
2,Only good for USMLE review.,"This book is too concise to study from for your medical course. It has no explanation of the facts or theories whatsoever. It is perfect once you've already learnt Embryology (from another book), and wish to simply review the facts. But if you are studying Embryology for the first time, consider: Moore & Persaud - Before We Are Born, Larsen - Human Embryology, and Sadler - Larsen's Medical Embryology.Personally this is one book I would not want on my bookshelf, because I do not believe in buying books simply for review. I want a reference, something I can go back to when I need to check something."
3,Great backup band,"Buy It for the historical aspect, GREAT back up band, but TerryDolan more or less screams the vocals @ 1 note. Oh Well????"
2,Disappointing,"Was so excited to finally be able to see this film on DVD. The production design is superb and the ""bad acting"" was on the money, unfortunately the pacing of the movie is dreadfully slow and the script itself is very weak. It plods along for over an hour before the monsters appear, and then it comes to an abrupt end. I really want my money back on this one. The trailer was far better than the actual movie."
3,"Nostalgia-filled fun, but flawed","If you're a classic movie monsters fan, you'll love the effort that went into this film. It's meant to be the ""lost"" third film in Universal Pictures' monster mash-up ""House of ..."" series, and is set in 1946. Ron Chaney, grandson of Lon Chaney, Jr., stars as Dr. Bela Reinhart. He's invited five people to his remote castle, and he will pick one of them as his heir. Little do they know they are all his children, and that he himself is really a Frankenstein. Most of the movie plays as an old dark house mystery. The monster mayhem doesn't really get going until the last 15 minutes of the story. The acting isn't that great, but the attention to detail is amazing. The late Michael R. Thomas, however, gives an impressive performance as Count Dracula in the film's final minutes, and it's dedicated to his memory. The monster make-ups are quite excellent, too. If Chaney can polish his performing skills a bit, I'd be up for a sequel!"
3,Old time monsters are back,"I am a huge Universal monster fan. It is quite apparent that the folks who made this movie love them, too. The film was made to resemble a 1930s Universal film with lots of creepy castle time and fog. The acting is a bit weak, but it's all about the monsters, folks! Without doubt, the highlight is the Frankenstein-Wolfman battle in the climax. This one makes up for the short fight in the original Frankenstein meets the Wolfman movie. So, sit back with some popcorn, turn off the lights and revisit the melodramaticatmosphere of the past and visit The House of the Wolfman."
3,Only for Hardcore Fans of Universal Horror,"While this movie appears to have tons of monster screen time based on the trailer circling the internet, it is actually devoid of the monsters themselves for much of the film until around the last 15 minutes. It is a noble effort as a tribute to the classics of the 30's and 40's, but could have used significantly less dialogue, and more scenes with the monsters actually on screen. Despite this, there are Easter Eggs throughout the film that any veteran of Classic Horror should be able to easily spot and be entertained by. I would exclusively recommend this movie to only the most hardcore fans of the genre. Anyone new to old horror films wishing to be exposed to the genre would be better off watching the actual films themselves from the 30's and 40's as they sadly contain significantly more monster action than this film does."
1,Oh my,"How I really wanted to enjoy this little film. I think everybody else has pretty much nailed the faults of the production pretty well. I really have nothing new to say other than yes its worth a watch, if nothing else than for curiosity, but its really really not that good."
1,Bad acting on purpose? Great monsters though...,"The acting was so stilted it had to be bad on purpose, and I don't get that. The acting in Universal's Classic Monster films were actually pretty good. ""Oh... my... God.... look.... over....... there..."" followed my a long stare. It was so bad it was hard to watch... but the monster makeup was actually pretty good. It was a treat to see Frankenstein with the traditional flat top again."
3,"Wolfman,The Monster and Drac are getting the band back together.","Starring: Ron Chaney,John McGarr and Michael R. Thomas.Written,Directed : Eben McGarrImagine a completion of the `HOUSE OF...' movie series begun by Universal and somehow completed by Paramount.We really felt this film nailed the era (Love the cars),Sets (How did John McGarr do them) , And the makeup was perfect.Ron Chaney has a big role,Due to his name or not,He does the evil scientist well.Hey,Did we mention it's in Black & White and the monsters are truly as good as the originals.The music is very much in era, Looking at end credits...They used a full orchestra.So,Not giving away anything...Goes from HALF of `Ten little Indians' by Agatha Christie to purest points of Universal's Monsters."
5,Pretty!,Sister loved it. Bought to replace the one that she was wearing and cracking. This one is much more durable!
2,Poorly Described,"I have the black face version, identical except for color but not currently listed on Amazon.The description does not indicate that updating of the year and month windows is done manually. They are not operated by the watch mechanism but via manually depressed plungers on the edge of the case. Also the 24 hour dial is not adjustable to a different time zone than the main time so is IMO a almost useless feature. This is not noted in the description either.When setting the watch the date and day of week are intended to be set by plungers on the edge of the watch. On mine the day of week plunger will not operate the mechanism so I set the DOW via the time adjustment stem and then set the date via the plunger.The actual watch mechanism is a wrist watch size automatic wind nechanical watch mechanism fitted to a pocket watch case. It seems to be a solidly made stainless steel case but the claimed $1000+ MSRP seems out of line for what appears to be a Chinese movement watch in my opinion."
5,as described and on time,This book is being used for a college course and it was as described and on time. Was the book the course required.
3,An OK book about the american dream.,"Death of a salesman is a book about the american dream. The american dream is all about beeing succesful and make a better life for yourself. Everybody wants to be famous, swin around in money and live a ""easy"" -if you could call it easy, life. This is also Willy Lomans dream, but I guess that is not going to happen... In my opinion Willy does not realy try to make it better, he tries to flee by killing himself and he can't even manage to kill himself, what more is there to say! Willy is a falure. As for the book I gave it 3 stars, if I could, I would give it 2,5 because I feel ""blank"". The book isn't good or bad, it's somewhere in between.. OK, I guess."

3,Dealth of a saleman,this book is great..it demonstated our daily life and the suffocated live chasing for the unreality dreams
1,age 3 and up? Maybe for King Kong's kid!,"I got this for my friends child who ""needed"" it for Christmas and after jumping hoops, paying next day delivery, waiting for a ""delay in your order"" and finally shipping it to England (where they were out of them for toddlers), it did arrive in time for Christmas. Don't know anything about the ""joy"", ""durability"", of ""hours of entertainment"" BUT, it says it's recommended for age 3 and up. I did doubt this as the size is 7-8, but, hey, I didn't think I was the expert. My friends child could never be described as average build even for a 3 yr old. He's a big boy and this will not fit him for at least another 2 years according to my friend. But the mask says size 3 and that's perfect. They might need to get their sizing revisited. And, the belt buckle was not in the package. So, it huge and they can't even buckle it!! I'm giving it one star because he'll probably not be able to use it at all."
3,"Good, but not THAT good","I liked this book because it was really fun to look at! Although it does have some nudity, all the girly ""details"" are covered up and all. It's very colorful, which I like, but it DOES NOT at ALL show you how to draw manga. It does give you a peek in the lives of several girls, which is fun, but if you are expecting a how to draw book, don't buy this."
4,refreshing (owns it),Its nice to get a How to draw manga book drawn by a woman about girls. It helps people not fammillar with girl rituals like painting nails and puting on makeup( It makes me feel really ungirly...). They're lots of nice color images in it! I actually prefer this one to Vol 20Techniques for Drawing Female Manga Characters. Its got less fan service poses in it (though theirs some nude shots their not done in a perverted way.)
2,Fun to sit down and look at (once...) but not that usefull.,"This is very fun to flip through, but for the most part, the material was not essenshul for a serios artist.I must admit, that in the middle of some drawing or another, i said to myself 'wow, i think there is a picture of some clothing in that Girls' Life Illustration File book, that would look really hot on this caricture'. Some of the clothing was pretty interesting, but nothing was spectacularly 'new' or 'amazing'My main problem with the book was that all of the different girls looked exacly the same (except for the hair, which was big). the face and body never changes and this grew to be very annoying, as the body of the 'shy girl' and the 'sporty girl' would be very different. I know it is manga(simple faces, ect). but i would like to see a little more variaty in this book."
5,the beeeeest book,"Inside this book had colours !but... not every page... It's OK because in the pages that do not or have colours are Very Very GRRREAT !and there are more coloured pages than non-coloured pages(the first pages had colours)But don't look in chapter 4 :The Bare Essentials,because there are JUST ... NAKED (NUDE)Pictures!So,THIS BOOK IS VERY USEFUL and...FUN !!!BUY IT !!!!!!!!!!But...I wanted to say that this book DO NOTKept you learn drawing step to step but it's meaningis for you, drawing or Knowing a Girl's life and it had writted:Girl's life.......illutration file...that do not (doesn't) mean that you should Copy ECXACT the same,but you should knowthe importants (like as the ECXACT same hair,heads)of the mangaGirl drawing ( If you'd like to see boys , buy HOW TO DRAW MANGA--MALE CHARACTERS and I hadn't buy it so can someone write a review of that book if someone has it and begin writting :Dear Lucie...(My name is Lucie)Please?)"
4,An interesting and colorful guide book,"Generally, this book isn't really essential for beginner manga artists, but it does go into a considerable amount of detail. This book provides six different girls as examples and explores how they arrange their rooms, their clothing, cosmetics, kimono-style, whether they prefer a bath or shower, what they wear to bed, and many other details (there are even examples of how they paint their nails!). Almost all of this is illustrated in detailed, full-color images, many of which are looking through more than once.Overall, this is more of a guide for a for someone who has already grasped the basic drawing concepts of manga. However, Girls' Life Illustration Fileis fully capable of keeping it's readers interested throughout most if not all of the entire book."
5,Gripping reading for anecdotes,"this is not for those searching for easy belly laughs. This is a work of art lovingly cobbled together and illustrating some of the humor of the ages, dating from the beginning of printing press publishing. Makes a wonderful gift for students of writing."
2,Better books out there.....,"This book is an ok way to learn 3d studio max, but a better book is included with 3d studio max (assuming you dont have a pirated version) This book often times has vague descriptions of what you are supposed to do which can leave you wondering for upwards of 15 minutes, and it was written for 2.0 (not 2.5). Also, I have also found many typos in the book that make learning that much more troublesome."
2,The faulty attached CD-ROM spoils an otherwise good book,"The tutorials are based on existing files on the CD. Unfortunately the CD in my case was faulty and therefore rendered the tuturials practically useless. The CD seems to be a common problem with reviewers. I saw this, but thought it wouldn't happen to me. I regret purchasing this book. It was a waste of money."
4,3D Max as a new career,I've just left teaching 3rd grade to begin a career in Max. This book has helped so much with the basics and fundamentals that you need to learn and understand. It goes step-by-step and is very clear compared to the tutorials which take for granted what the learner already knows. For anyone just beginning this is a great way to learn the program.
3,Dissapointed,Not found what I expected. It is true that it is an introduction. not more. Havent fount anything about modifiers...etc. I recommend you to wait for Inside 3DS MAX Release 2 Series. Reaaly..(I'm tired of waiting)
2,Leadership Vapor ...,"I received a copy of this book from upper management as part of an offsite planning retreat. Reading it later, it struck me that ""there is no there there."" Max DePree may be a nice guy and maybe was an effective CEO for Herman Miller, but trying to climb down from the clouds to distill his advice to a day to day operational level is like nailing Jell-O to a wall.Come to think of it, ""Leadership Jazz"" may be somewhat like chicken soup for the management soul. It certainly won't hurt and just may help.Perhaps the best thing about it is the fact that it is a quick read. Platitudes, sermonizing and bromides about servant leadership abound. I'm not saying it's bad, just a bit ethereal.If this is leadership ""jazz,"" I'm not sure I want to riff with that band ...."
4,Depree Gets it Right,"Max Depree provides a great knowledge base and a vast amount of information for improving leadership at all levels. He doesn't try to answer all the questions, instead he carefully guides you along a path where you can make your own decisions. I highly recomend this book to leaders at all levels."
1,Leadership ?,"This is a very poorly written book. The author terms without defining them, leaving the reader wondering what it is he is talking about. His writing is cliche-ridden. He insists on using 'she' instead of 'he', showing the worst kind of condescending political correctness. And the Christian bias is very blatant, enough so to be offensive to non-Christian readers."
3,Ok Leadership,"The Max Dupree book was ok I guess. I read this book for a Communication leadership class and it has some good points and a few that were no good. Dupree writes the book so that about anyone can read and understand but is no thriller. It is based on some solid leadership principles but not all of them. It does give some insights on how to be a more effective leader in the future. It does however have too much emphsis on the ""touchy-feely aspect to leadership in my opinion. I probably would not have read the book had I not been assigned but it was not bad but not that good either. What I am most confused about is the use of she and not he, What is up with that?"
3,Doesn't fit smaller hands,"I have a small hand and cannot manuever this glove very well. But my husband has no problem with it. So although I won't be using it, my husband will."
1,just buy elsewhere...,"the item received was not as described.the gloves run small.the velcro closures are too difficult to operate. go ahead, try to put your second glove on.when i decided to return the item for the reasons above, i was charged a restocking fee. might as well have just kept them and re-sold them on ebay or something.do yourself a favor, buy something else from somewhere else."
3,clarity found!,I feel this book allows the reader to access all the synchronicity that has been experienced but with a new awareness. Debbie Taylor writes concisely and warmly-
3,For Adults or Teenagers Learning Chinese,This book is for adults or teenagers learning Chinese. Don't buy it for little kids. This will just confuse them. Most of the pictures don't really look like the charaters.
1,"Fun? Monotonous and poorly illustrated, maybe...","This book is not the best book to use if you are trying to learn Chinese characters. The book tries, but fails, to teach basic Chinese characters through ""comics"".Interesting approach, however, while the comics provide mini-stories and an attempt at entertainment, the book is filled with dated illustrations and reads as if it was written for a Singaporean audience--the ""humor"" in most cases, doesn't translate. In most cases the lead character is a racist portrayal of a Chinese man.After about 10 pages, this book becomes extremely monotonous. I would not recommend this book to anyone struggling to learn Chinese characters. Lastly, the overall quality of the book is quite poor with inside pages printed on what appears to be newsprint. If you decide to buy it, make sure you buy a new copy."
5,Fun & Easy to use...,"My family and I have enjoyed using the Fun with Chinese Characters books (Volume 1, 2, & 3). The books make it possible to learn the Chinese characters with ease. The visuals add a sense of humor which makes learning the characters easy to remember and fun. This book is a great resource for all ages interested in learning the Chinese writing system."
3,NOT FOR 2001 SUZUKI VITARA,"I don't know whether Amazon or the seller is responsible, but this product was mistakenly listed as fitting a 2001 Suzuki Vitara. NOTE: IT DOES NOT FIT A 2001 SUZUKI VITARA. I give it 3 stars in the form of a ""neither here nor there"" review, the radiator itself looked well built and was packaged very well, but the lack of a photograph of the radiator and the erroneous vehicle compatibility listing are inexcusable. Amongst the fit issues: the inlet was on the wrong side, the fill spout was on the wrong side, the mounting brackets were perpendicular to where they needed to be, and it did not have the transmission cooling ports.Recommendation to the seller: add a photo of the radiator to the listing, and remove the compatibility listing for 2001 Suzuki Vitara's."
4,TOTAL HILLBILLY CORN ! OOOOOOOWEEEEE,"Yes,city slickers will die of embarassment when you play this disc. The Collins Kids could deliver high energy Hillbilly rock with the best of 'em. This review is for the single disc , 22 track edition."
4,Must have,"That kid probably surpassed my guitar ability long before he could walk...Great Cd, great songs. It's a must have. Just don't be decieved by the amazon listing... this is 22 tracks."
3,Ghost Son,Nice show but i quite don't get the story but another horror movie with few nude scene for a wake up call will only rate the movie as 3 stars
1,BMI strikes again,"Hoo! Bad. I mean, real bad. But bad in a funny way. BMI specializes in horror novels that are bad in a funny way, I think. And they've published some real wangers, but this one may take the cake.In 1931, a student at a new and exclusive Massachusetts girls' school is possessed by some kind of demonic entity (what, exactly, is never specified) and murders the headmaster, whom she has a crush on, and the two students she discovers him with. Fifty years later, the school (which IS the demonic entity... but we're still not sure what, why, or how) sets up the same scenario with a new cast.Yup. Bad, I mean, bad. Predictable, silly, gratuitous. Four hundred pages of utter tripe. I laughed in every place I wasn't supposed to."
5,I LOVE THEM,"I love this product My husband and I have TTC for 1 year, so I was tired of reading lines, so i broke down and paid 15 more dollars and got the digital. I tested 6 days and got no smiley face, then on my last test strip, I got a smily face, and i am having all the symtoms of ovulating, so I really hope I get a postive at the end of this month!!!! I am ready to start our family!! Good luck to all of you women!!"
5,Soo much better than the cheapy wodolf ones.,Trick to using these is do it twice a day once in the morning and then once in the late afternoon. Ive been doing that for the past 5 days and this morning got a negative and just tested a few mins ago and got a positive. I would recommend to get the 20pk and test twice a day like I mentioned above.Ive been trying to get pregnant for the past year and no luck and we will see if these tests help so Ill try and update and let everyone know if it helps me finally get baby #2.
5,Excellent product. WORKS!!!!!,"If you are looking for an ovulation kit, just go ahead and buy this. It works, it is easy to read, true it is a little expensive but it gives you peace of mind since you are paying for a product that gives you accurate results. It is rated the most reliable of all and it is great!!!"
3,No smileys,"Just received the ovulation test kits in the mail. The item I received is not identical to what was described in the Amazon Product Features. My test kits indicate LH surge by displaying lines....no smiley faces for me! I was kinda looking forward to those smiley faces, but alas, the lines will have to do. The item I was sent also included pregnancy tests. So I received the 14 ovulation tests plus 2 pregnancy tests."
1,Won't turn on,"I bought a test but it wouldn't turn on. Rite Aid wouldn't take it back. I then bought another. The second one would not turn on. I called the 1-800 number provided on the literature, but they were no help. So now I own two that I cannot return but neither works."
1,not replacement strips!!!,"This is NOT ONLY replace strips. Clear Blue does not provide replacement strips for this test. You have to buy a new kit every time, it's extremely enviromentally unfriendly and irresponsible and I'm personally going with another brand from now on. Annoyed!!!"
1,Don't be fooled by the name of the book.,Look for somewhere else if you are serious about network security. The content of the whole book is just too superficial !
4,"Ivory lace, but white pillow","This is a very cute ring bearer pillow, and due to the colors theme of my wedding, I wanted an ivory pillow. The description states that it is ivory, when in fact the pillow is white and just the lace is ivory. I like it enough because of the lace detailing to ignore the slight mismatch with other wedding components though."
4,So Beautiful - maybe just a bit small,"I read the reviews and noted the product dimensions. For my seven year old grandson, the size was actually just right for him. There wasn't a good way to attach the actual rings to the pillow (not sure we wanted to do that anyway), so he carried the pillow down the aisle mostly as a ""prop"". The Vintage design is so very beautiful and goes well with the matching flower girl basket."
3,So so,"Although this book had a good start, I got kind of tired of it and didn't find it very intersting. Her husband is in a coma almost for the entire book, which was a little tiresome and drawn out. I like Elizabeth Berg a lot, but I think she kind of missed the mark here."
3,Didn't live up to it's reputation,"I've been hearing about Range of Motion for several years now and finally got around to reading it. For no particular reason, I expected a meaty, challenging read - something along the lines of Smiley or Hamilton. What I found was a much more simple book that left me unsatisfied. The writing is correct and the fundamental story is one worth telling. Still, there are lots of loose ends in the story. The most frustrating part is the end where it seems to me the story is just starting. What was life like with Jay back in their lives? What could they resume and what was irrevocably changed?Bottom line -- an easy read with some thought provoking elements. Still, it is so straight forward that my book group ran out of things to talk about in the book after only 30 minutes."
5,Thought provoking,"I picked up this book on a whim at the library. I had never heard of Elizabeth Berg at the time but after reading this book, I have since bought nearly every book she has written. The writing is not difficult or elaborate, but the intense questions it conjures up are. While reading this book, I had to stop and really examine the thoughts and emotions it brought up. I liked that it was thought provoking and evoked strong emotion. I love a book that can make me laugh or cry and I adore a book that can make me examine my beliefs and experiences. This one did that and stayed with me long after finishing the story."
2,Draggy prose or excessive introspection?,"The author has Lainey spending too much time revising her inner thoughts. There is excessive introspection, and her dialogs with the ghost woman seem really forced at times. Also, the side-story (her neighbor's affair) is distracting and quite frankly, a bit corny.Another point that annoyed me was Lainey's visit to the man whose wife was also in a coma. Lainey, who subtlety is portrayed as unselfish, borderline holy, passes some serious negative judgement on this guy. Why? Why jump on the moral high horse now?In summary: somewhere between contrition and a made for TV movie"
1,Are you kidding me?,This novel is like watching paint dry. Are you kidding me? How long can you draw out a husband in a coma. I wish I had visited the husband in the coma. It would have been more interesting than this dry prose. Please spare me any more of these sawdust works!! Kill the bastard already.
3,Very honest!,"This book is about a woman whose husband is in a coma and she doesnt know if he will be able to recover. It is honest and addresses some of the questions we probably all would ask ourselves but would be ashamed to admit - what if he doesn't get better? What about me? Should I date again? The only problem I have with the book is that the characters are slightly underdeveloped, a common complaint I have about all Elizabeth Berg books. But a good read!"
2,THIS HAS TO BE BERG AT HER WORST~,"I particularly liked Berg's ""Open House"" but was extremely disappointed with ""Range of Motion."" The story begins when Lainey's husband, Jay, is hit on the head by ice falling from a building and is rushed to the hospital. There he remains in a coma. Lainey brings Jay's favourite things from home with the hope that scents, sounds, smells and feel of familiar things will help him come out of the coma.The book seems to drag on forever and the characters have absolutely no substance or realistic quality. They remind me of wind-up toys going through the motions (maybe that is what prompted the title, ""Range of Motion?)and feeling nothing. Lainey's best friend, Alice, adds nothing to the book and the ghost of a woman who previously lived in Lainey's home is just too bizarre and far-fetched to be believable. The ending was predictable almost from page one. What more can I say, ""The booked is boring, dull, a chore to finish, and now sits in my compost bin."""
4,A New Elizabeth Berg Fan,"This is the 3rd Berg book I've read and I have loved them all. This one is probably my favorite as of yet. I love her wit and the way I can laugh suddenly and then cry with the turn of the page. This is a very sad story, yet very realistic. Somehow she (Berg) manages to create every emotion in her stories, yet they are very smooth reads. I'll definitely keep reading."
3,"A good book, but a bit disappointing","This was my first experience with this author. The story was enjoyable, but I felt a little too much time was spent on the fantasy aspect, which could have been better spent developing the characters. I found myself skipping partial paragraphs. Enjoyed the book, but I'm not rushing out to experience this author again."
5,Berg at her best,"Range of Motion was my third Elizabeth Berg novel (Talk Before Sleep and Until the Real Thing Comes Along being the other two) and I must say this is by far my favorite. I loved this book from the opening line to the finishing sentence. Berg portrayed her title character, Lainey, with great sympathy and passion for what she loved. I loved Lainey all the way through the book and she remains my favorite fiction character. Throughout the novel Lainey is dealing with her husband being in a coma after a freak accident along with taking care of her two daughters and helping her neighbor cope with a failing marriage. I cried along with Lainey and smiled at her happy moments the entire time keeping the faith that Lainey's husband would one day wake up along with her. For any fan of Berg or any reader interested in a truly great book, I highly recommend Range of Motion."
5,Berg does not disappoint!,"I have enjoyed reading books by Elizabeth Berg. I couldn't wait to find out the ending of this book. This writer has a unique talent with words on paper. She describes things in a way that allows the reader to see things a little different. I find myself absorbed not only in the story but the way she tells it. This was a unique plot. It isn't just the story of a woman whose husband is in a coma. It is a story of the things in her life that help her cope. From the next door neighbor who is losing her husband to another, to the apparition who distracts her enough to help take her mind off her troubles. This is another great read by Berg! Highly recommend"
4,"""Range of e-motion""","Elizabeth Berg has a wonderful way with words that women can easily relate to. She seems to know each of us intimately. Our secrets, our longings, our personal and private pain. While not all of us will be called to experience the heartache of caring for a comatose loved one, in Range of Motion, Elizabeth helps us to realize that life does not always give what we expect, but the friendship of women can serve as a strong shield against the cruelties that life hurls our way. Elizabeth is a master at meeting us where we are in life. You will laugh, you will cry, you will feel anger and fear as you immerse yourself in Range of Motion, and if you are like me, you will find it difficult to put the book down until you have absorbed the very last word."
4,Nice pillows,"After having very old pillows for way too many years, if found these to be a delight and at a good price, too"
3,not for me,This pillow is rather stiff for a feather pillow and a bit too dense for ths side sleeper. I perfer my pillows fluffy and a bit springy? This is not once it mold to your head it just keeps becoming more packed down.
3,You get what you paid for,"If it's 575+ pillow, then you should look for much higher numbers as this pillow is very soft and doesn't provide enough support so that you end up feeling a mattress"
3,Not bad,Pretty good pillow for the price I got them at. I am a 6 pillow in the bed person and I like soft fluffy pillows.These pillows do not have enough filling in them--if they had more they would be perfect
1,dissapointed in value,"I AM SOMEWHAT DISSAPOINTED IN THE VALUE OF THE PILLOWS.. THEY HAVE NOT KEPT THEIR SHAPE AFTER A FEW DAYS USE, ALSO BY MY OWN MISTAKE I ORDERED REG . SIZE AND NEEDED QUEEN SIZE SO I AM USING THEM IN MY GUEST ROOM.. THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY ."
1,Royal Velvet Pillows,These pillows were over rated and the description on Amamzon not accurate.We are very disapointed and could have done better and cheaper at Wal Mart.
2,Not the best,"I loved these pillows when I first received them, but as time passes, they are loosing feathers left and right."
4,Good pillows,These are good well made feather pillows and a great deal for the money. They lie rather flat which is exactly what I wanted - my neck does not need an overstuffed pillow. The covers are excellent and there was absolutely no odor at all. I would definitely recommend these pillows for those who want a flatish but scrunchable feather pillow and don't have the money to spend on the high end versions.
2,They still smell,"Yes, its been two months since I bought them and they still smell. Also they aren't as soft and fluffy as I would like. Sometimes they feel clumpy! Would not buy again."
2,Good for about 3 months,"After 3 months this pillow DEFINITELY let me down. Unlike the other ""5 star review"" this pillow took about 1 week to fully break in. However after 2 months the pillow started to soften. I have just completed a 90 day trial and would definitely return it if possible.DO NO BUY THIS PILLOW UNLESS YOU ARE COMFORTABLE WITH A FLAT PILLOW"
3,"Alright, just alright","Not a bad product, decent really... It is what it says it is. If you fluff it a lot it kinda looks like the one in the picture. Honestly, you can do much better for this price. On pillows under $12 its probably better to stick with synthetic; the ones with Comforel stuffing are amazing. You might want to keep on shopping if you want a good feather pillow."
4,The ups and downs of being a high school junior,"I love this book, probably more than Dear Lovey Hart, because it deals with a successful young lady, talented and in love. She's trying to do the right thing with her investigative reporting AND to make things a little more complicated, her boyfriend is the editor/her investigative partner. When her boyfriend shallowly falls for Purdie (which, never quite made sense to me, but I guess he really is only 16), Carrie has to deal with how to take care of numero uno, even when her heart breaks. Only problem with the story is the ending, in which she hardly pushes back to Chip about how badly he treated her. Chip's a nice guy and all, but he was an idiot and all we can hope is that he comes through on all the making up he needs to do!Conford, however, does make up for this in other books where she writes of her heroines pursuing shallow men when the good guys are right in front of them."
3,Good,"It was used product I ordered, but it was in good condition. I was searching this book all over the world, I found it here. Came in to my home address in reasonable time. Just the book was $4, shipping charges was bit expensive."
3,"Premise good, romance not so much","The premise of this book was interesting. I enjoyed the mystery, the magic, and that there was a slight twist to it. The reason I only gave the book 2 stars was because in the end, the romance fell a little flat to me. I didn't think the relationship was developed enough for there to be much of a relationship there."
3,"Good book, atrocious kindle editing","This work is an old favorite, and I liked it enough to purchase both the paperback and kindle ebook versions. I'm really surprised by the poor quality of the kindle version, though: you can't skim through a page without stumbling over a land mine of spelling errors. Whatever OCR software was used seems especially confused by ""t""s and ""c""s, resulting in common sightings of ""co,"" ""cell,"" and ""chat"" in place of ""to,"" ""tell,"" and ""that."" At least it has chapter markers."
4,"Nicely made, but spaghetti cutter not perfect","Overall I'm happy with the set. It's solidly built and looks like it will last. The flat roller gets highest marks: rolling pasta sheets out is really easy and convenient. The linguine cutter works reasonably well. But the spaghetti cutter basically scores the sheets of pasta, leaving most of the noodles lightly attached. They mostly detach when cooked, but not entirely."
2,What is this product?,"This is a confusing item. It used to be a ""set"" containing an angel hair pasta cutter and a thick noodle cutter, but now it is unclear what is being sold. Is it just one noodle cutter, but all the reviews seems to say that it was two items: angel hair cutter and noodle cutter. Amazon and Kitchenaid need to be clear what they are selling here especially with this very high price."
5,does what it is supposed to do.,"It looks good, it works well, it lives up to kitchenaid's good reputation. Like the other pasta cutters and the roller, it works better if you dust the sheets with flour between rolling and between rolling and cutting. That way everything works smoothly and the strands separate. I don't separate the individual strands of angel hair, but like the manual says, you can make a little nest of it in a baggy and freeze it.When you cook the pasta, stir it while it is first in the water to break apart the clumps, and you will have something good to eat that you know was prepared with care."
5,Love!,"To me, this is the best of the best. The fragrance lingers throughout the house and smells so clean and fresh. Would love to have more available so I can load up!!"
3,Bits & Pieces of Bletchley Park's History,"There should never be any shortage of admiration for the work done by BP's codebreakers and staffers -- a great majority of them being women. Michael Smith's book on Bletchley Park is a collection of fun facts, historical highlights, and occasionally dense information on wartime codebreaking methods. It makes for untidy reading and indicates the storytelling of someone who's been too immersed in the story to really understand how to distill it for general consumption anymore. That said, I still found the book enjoyable, and I'm all the more motivated to find out more."
1,Horrible product,"I just bought his wheeled cart last week and it broke literally in half this morning. When I got it home I was very disappointed because the handle was too short for me (I'm 5'6) and I have to stoop over to use it. I used it for 5 days not even reaching the max weight capacity and this morning as I was lifting it into my truck for work, the entire lower half cracked in half! All my books and graded papers went flying! What a waste of money. I'm back on here to by a better product. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!!!!!!I give it an F-"
2,Cracks Easily,"I bought this product about six months ago. It was very easy to put together and certainly made carrying things easier. However, it only took about 2 months for it to crack at the bottom. I kept using it and putting off buying a new one until it was completely unusable. That day came five months after using it. It won't hold anything anymore."
1,arrived broken,"Tote arrived broken. Six small pieces were broken off so that handle did not extend. It seemed to be made with very cheap plastic. I returned it along with the apron cover sold with it. I did not get a full refund and don't know why. And I can't find where to complain that I did not get a full refund. I would avoid this tote, especially since you will not get a full refund if it arrives broken."
1,Buy a different cart,First one I received was cracked on the bottom and the handle would not operate correctly. I exchanged it figuring there is a lemon every now and then. I should have listened to the other reviews...when I received the second one I opened it to find the the wheel protector was broken...do not buy this product!!!!!!!
2,Couldnt handle it,I am a teacher that takes my work home with me almost every day and I really relied on this cart. However after about 2 months the bottom fell out due to my apparent over use of the cart. :(
3,Pages,"I was surprised to find that the book had no Preface. I would expect that a report of missing pages would be part of the ad. Let's see, is that 20 words or must I add some more?"
3,"Interesting, but not a real ethnography","Make no mistake, this is a travelogue, not an ethnography in the traditional sense. Hurston, who was a voodoo priestess of a high order herself, was too immersed in the culture to really view it objectively, which is necessary for any anthropologist. That said, it's still a very interesting read and certainly emphasizes the fact that voudon is a valid religion and not a set of superstitions. However, I'm puzzled as to why Ismael Reed (himself an accomplished writer) is listed as a credit. Did he write the introduction? Because he didn't write this book. Hurston wrote it. She traveled to Haiti by herself in the 30s to investigate this. It was not written by Reed."
1,Thinly veiled nationalist revisionism of the Balkans,After reading this book it is not hard to understand why Tudjman is considered the foremost ideological hardliner among the multitude of former-Communist-turned-nationalist leaders. Facts are often doubtful and interpretations have frequently been ammended or changed to suit current conveniences.
1,paperback is a strong word for this pamphlet,Priced high to be a pamphlet. I was really disappointed when I got the pamplet and was expecting a paperback book.
2,Neon Nits only for Dark Hair and removal foam does not kill lice,"I was very disappointed that the Neon Nits spray they sent is labeled for use on ""dark hair."" I didn't see this mentioned anywhere before I made the purchase, and my children are all rather fair-haired so this was a waste of money for us.I also wish I had realized that the Lice and Nit Removal Kit that comes with this package is only a lubricant to help remove the nits. It will not kill anything. On the upside, at least its safe!The reason I gave this product any stars was that the Nit Free Terminator comb that it includes does seem very effective. It is rather painful and pulls the kids hair more than I wish, but I can't imagine any nit or lice could possibly slip through its tight teeth. You can purchase the Terminator comb separately, however, and save a lot of money."
1,Lice kit,"This item did not work at all the shampoo did not kill the live bugs and comb did nothing for my daughters hair. I have found the only thing that gets eggs out is pulling them out one by one with your finger nails. Lice are horrible. I have tried to find out how to return this item and e-mailed the seller and no reply, very disappointing.I also ordered pink spray and got white spray and that does nothing for blond hair. I will say they do ship quickly."
2,I will stick with a metal pan,"This pan is not totally non-stick. Many of the tarts and muffins that I have made in this pan have stuck to the bottom and also easily burned in this pan. Great idea, but better functionality and easier to get tarts out of a metal pan."
3,A helpful guide for a serious Simpsons collector.,"It's not a licensed book, but 1990's ""Simpson Mania"" by Steve Dole and Shane Tritsch is a worthwhile addition to any Simpsons collection. In addition to telling the first-year story of the series, the book features more than two-dozen color photographs of Simpsons merchandise, from bumper stickers to T-shirts. The entire fourth chapter, ""A Craze in the Making,"" is devoted to merchandising.While by no means a comprehensive look at Simpsons merchandise -- many of the best products came after the book was published -- it is a helpful guide to what was available in those early days."
1,The worst film ever made,"This has to be the worst horror film...no wait the worst film I have ever seen in my entire life, the acting was terrible the villian was forgettable, and if you didn't guess the end, before it ended you need a doctor. This movie is dumb, stupid, and I don't need to see Pilers and Mans privates ever together again in any movie. Avoid this at all costs, this is a very stupid movie, I rather watch Lake Placid 2 again."
2,Who are the Carver family?,"This movie is apparently based on the true events surrounding the infamous Carver family in the backwoods of some ""real"" town. The Carver family consists of two brothers, one a red headed invalid bartender who is half retarded and his obese, useless and totally retarded brother who likes to wear gogles as he kills people. This movie presents the well worn plot of 4 very unlikable 20 somethings who stop their pointless roadtrip long enough to cross the 2 retarded serial killers. The end result is lots of blood and over the top gore with very little plot or empathy derived from the audience. I found myself nodding off on a couple of occasions during the movie which proves that ripping off a man's package with pliers isn't enough to cover for bad moviemaking and predictable crap acting."
2,not that good,"i rented this based on the trailer and the positive reviews, but this movie is not all that great. the acting sucked and it was too low budget for my taste. ive seen worse thats why im giving it a 2 and not a 1 star. some good gore but the acting took away from what could have been something like hostel. if you are into low budget horror and gore than i guess you can give it a try but dont expect too much. glad i rented this for free"
1,CRAP,"Yet another homemade style move. Let's see, a lousy soundtrack, crap acting, dumb plot, no make-up, gore yes but I've seen a lot better. They throw in a Sheri Moon Zombie wannabe (not happening) and for some reason this movie shows many people on the toilet. Maybe the director is obsessed with fecal matter, I dunno. I do know that this movie was slow paced, boring, predictible and really had no scare to it. I'm glad I didn't pay the full purchase price. PASS!"
1,"Bad, Bad, Bad","My husband decided to rent this movie because it said that it was ""based on actual events"". What a huge disappointment. Extremely boring, bad acting, no plot to speak of, and the list goes on and on. Some of the torture scenes are interesting at most, but alot of this stuff has been done in movies like ""Saw"" and ""Hostel"". I've read some of the other reviews and for the life of me, I can't figure out why some of you are giving this movie 3 or 4 stars. You've obviously not seen a decent horror movie before. If you really want to see some good, and I mean Good horror movies check out Texas Chainsaw Massacre (the original), Wrong Turn (If your into the hillbilly stuff), and House of 1000 Corpses. These are much better by far then this movie. Please, please don't waste your money on this one."
5,GLADIATORS PREPARE FOR GLORY!,the title says it all: gladiators were fierce warriors prepared to fight for their lives and they didn't care if you were already hurt their job to move on to fight another day was to to end your day. this book goes into the history of their combat and a must read for any fan of gladiators
5,Review,"My daughter loved it. I wish she had bought it,She was looking for it due to telling her aunt about it."
2,For Kids,I have two smaller children and this show did not keep their interest. It might be better show for a little bit older child.
1,"Bad, really bad choice","Record company trying to cash in on the Salsa Craze? What a sad record. One of the truly greats (El Guayabero), paired up with a cartoon version of a Cuban back up band and singers. Avoid at all costs. Get his more authentic, older, ""El Guayabero"" cd."
1,What were they thinking??,"El Guayabero is certainly of music's greats. Cuban or otherwise.But this cd is an abomination.Who though that it'd be a good idea to have a bunch of third rate backup singers trying to sing what they imagine is Cuban choruses?The background singers sound like a bad imitation of generic Latin singers. Heck, they don't even sound Cuban. The CD was recorded in the Nanary Isles, which may explain the poor choice of backup singers. Totally unauthentic.They sing too fast, and poorly at that.El Guyabero and his tres are great, as always. But adding that noise in the background (it's not fitting to call the background music, as it detracts grom the real music played by Faustino) is criminal.Get ""El Guayabero"" (that's the cd's title) which is far more authentic. The version of Marieta on that recording is <i>the<i/> one to get.Avoid this horrible marketing driven hack."
1,Unreliable,"The power adapter failed within an year of use. Unfortunately, it uses non-standard power socket so I cant even replace power adapter. Otherwise, the device was made well. It was sturdy, had adequate ventilation and nice blue light when it was powered. Too bad it dies so quickly."
4,Well worth the price,"I installed two drives that I replaced when I upgraded a computer. I now have the benefit of drives' additional capacity at a very low cost. The enclosures work reliably and are sturdily built. There is one exception however; one enclosure came with an internal connector that loosley grabbed a wire and gave an intermittent connection. I fixed it with a little solder rather than returning the unit (the price was so low that I didn't care about ruining the warranty). That is the reason for a 4 star rating rather than a 5. Otherwise, Windows XP has no problems with either drive. It's just plug and play."
3,Not what I expected,"I don't know why I expected more from this toy. My daughter loves the Teletubbies, and it seemed like this toy would be loads of fun for her. I was somewhat disappointed when the toy arrived - I think they could have done a much better job making it look like Teletubby land, and could have thought the pieces through a bit more to make itmore entertaining for children. My daughter loves the little Teletubby figures, and loves NooNoo (since she has never had a Noo Noo toy before) but will not even play with the rest of the toy or parts - all in all, it's an average toy, but nothing spectacular like many of the other Teletubbies toys available."
3,Questionable value,"This was incredibly expensive for a tiny plastic playset, but i guess it isn't produced any more. I got it for a friend's kids and she can afford it. I would'nt."
4,Loved by my 2 and 5 year old!,"I bought two of these as my kids would argue over it if I didn't. One came broken, the white plastic 'thing' that holds the table down on to the main toy wasn't there, so it wobbled an fell off easily. Other than that, my kids LOVED it. They take the Tubbies with them in the bath and play with it almost daily (which is amazing considering the number of toys they have, and few get that much play time). Good value!!"
3,Do You Like Your Rachmaninoff Fast or Slow?,"If speed is what you're after, then this performance is for you. Most pianists these days like to take this concerto at breakneck velocity, which is unfortunate. This frequently happens when the recording is of a live concert, as is the case here, and most of Rachmaninoff's lush romanticism is lost in a tidal wave of notes, especially in the second movement. I'd recommend a videotape of a live performance by Alexis Weissenberg and Herbert von K. Weissenberg allows the second movement to flow at a relaxed pace and is not shy about letting it stretch to nearly 15 minutes. It is the only performance I would have of the Rach Second."
4,"Competent orchestra, conductor and piano player","I liked very much this DVD. Well, it is not difficult for me to like the pieces of Tchaikosvsky and Rachmaninov. They are my favorites composers. The player in No. 2 concerto is plenty is sensibility and vigorous emotion. The solemnity of Symphony No.5 is well demonstrated by the orchestra with many young people doing a good job under secure direction of the conductor."
5,Fascinating.....A Must Read,I have summered in Newport for many years and never knew about this truly historic heroine. This summer I will surely make it a point to take a moment to remember the life and times ofMs. Lewis. She wasn't your typical Newporter by any stretch of the imagination. Fascinating....a must read!
5,Ohh Too Cute,"I bought this and the ""Girls who lunch"" tattoo's for my Cousin Bachelorette Party Favor Bags(shh- dont tell her). I gotta say, for $2- they are so worth it. The sheet is about the size of a 5X7, and the packaging is very Cute- almost chic. The pic on the web- really doesnt do them justice. These are going to go over really well with the party goers! Thanks"
5,Look at kitty go!,"I recently purchased this item from my fourteen year old female tabby, TippyToes. Boy, does she sure love it! She doesn't even seem to mind that I'm actually in control of it. She'll chase it all day, for minutes at a time. I like the fact that it runs off of AAA batteries which are less expensive than the button batteries most lasers use. This product even came with two extra batteries! Yeah, it's much bigger than the laser penlights but I prefer this because I'd lose those smaller keychain deals. Both me and my kitty give this item three paws up! An exceptional buy!"
2,Perfect Case.... For Awhile,"I really liked this briefcase when I bought it in September 2009. It protected my 15"" MacBook Pro very well, and in spite of its slim appearance was able to carry many extras. But by May 2010, both zippers had broken, rendering the case completely useless. I'm tempted to buy another one because it was so good, but not going to keep ""renting"" them for 8 months at a time. Sorry, but can't recommend."
2,not as good as it looks,"I thought it looked good when I ordered it last year. It looks a lot better on the website than it does in person. It's bulkier than I wanted. One of the zippers broke off after a couple of months.I bought this case, so I can't just throw it away and replace it, at least not 'til I've had it for more than a year. But I'm looking forward to replacing it. Maybe I'm just spoiled because my last case was a wonderful one by a Canadian company that's long gone out of business, and my rating is based on my comparison to that case."
5,second of the Lily Bard series,"Lily Bard is a cleaning woman with a tragic past, and she's chosen to get away from the spotlight by settling in Shakespeare, Arkansas. In this second outing Lily discovers a body in the gym where she works out, and the death seems to be connected to other acts of violence in the area. Also, this is the book where Lily meets her soulmate (though she doesn't know it yet), Jack Leeds. As always, Ms. Harris, author of the Sookie Stackhouse novels, is a fine writer. The dialogue is authentic, the characters are interesting and the mystery is feasible. Lily Bard is a compelling protagonist, and the writing for the climactic scene, in which several people are injured, is truly exceptional.I started reading this series to get me through waiting for another Sookie insatlment, and I'm really glad I did. Lily is a very interesting heroine and the mysteries are quite fun to read."
3,good read,"I love Charlaine Harris. I read the Sookie novels first and wanted to find another series to fill the void while I wait for the next installment of Sookie. I enjoyed the first novel in this series Shakespeare's Landlord, so I got this one.I enjoyed this one also, but not as much as the first. It's a fast read, and farely simple to narrow down the suspects before she does, but worth reading.Altough I do enjoy the Lily Bard novels, I may switch to another series to see if any appeal to me more. I like Lily, but I can't relate very easily and I believe thats making it harder for me to get into.but I would recommend this book."
3,Dark mystery....,"This book was better than the first ""Shakespeare's Landlord"". I really like the character of Lily and the mystery wasn't bad. I enjoy most of the characters and Lily's community for the most part. This series is far too dark to be considered a cozy although a lot of people seem to classify it as one. There wasn't any great suprises here; nor was it boring. I'd like to see Lily get some of her happiness back; she just seems like a fairly unhappy person...I understand her background and the reason for it is logical but it'd be nice to see some good things happen to her. I wish I could say more about this story but in my opinion it was good, not great. There is nothing specifically bad about it, nor anything amazingly positive either."
1,Ugh,"Wow, this was a big disappointment. I happen to really like the first one, and this is nothing like it. Horrible CGI. I loath to even refer to it as acting. No suspense, no cheap scares, no halfway decent one liners. They don't even have consistency. First they decide it's to fast to outrun, then they decide hey, lets make a run for it! You've been warned, so if you waste your money on this gem, it's your own fault."
2,2.3 stars.......good for a rainy day,"Not bad , not as good as the original. It seems they ran out of money topolish off the CGI effects... I rented this version, cause ive seen somany more bad movies than this one.Could have been much better... great for a rainy day."
1,One of the worst movies released on DVD in 2008.,The special effects of the crocodiles are so so. But they do not look scary. the plot and the acting are below average. There are a lot of logical holes. There's no suspense.
1,this movie blows,do not watch this crappy movie. rent the first one instead save yourself movie. its so fake even my cat felt ripped off that i rented this. stay clear of this movie
1,Horrible,"Normally I enjoy B movies....and I loved the first Lake Placid. Aside from a few humorous moments, this was absolutely horrible. Thankfully I rented it first."
1,Embarrased to say i bought this,"Oh Boy, possibly the worst movie I have ever seen and I have seen some stinkers.You must be VERY HUNGRY for work to star in something like this.Save your self don't buy or even watch it."
1,Lake Placid 2,"Finally, Ed Wood can rest in peace knowing that he is NOT the worst director of all time. That title now goes to David Flores the director of NOW the worst movie of all time,in my humble opinion, ""Lake Placid 2"".I must admit that by looking at the cast lineup I thought it had hope, but boy was I ever mistaken. Cloris Leachman is a total waste and John (Duke Boy) Schneider is even worse. The CGI is terrible and the rest of the cast is a total waste as well.Don't waste your time and money."
1,poorly done,"unlike lake placid which was funny and exciting, this part11 is a poorly made, unacted, and extremely corny remake that in my opinion is a waste of time and money"
3,cheer for the croc,"I was cheering for the croc munching on all the lick-butts! Once again good special effects, the subtle comedy and one-liners not as many as The Original, but still a good friday night fright flick. Cloris Leachman's one-liners stand out."
5,LOVE IT,LOVE IT LOVE TO GET GOOD MOVES LOVE MOVES LIKE THAT AND MY BOYS THE LOVE THAM TO WE SET BACK AND WACH THEM ALL THE TIME
4,Good movie,"Even though the effects of the movie are not the greatest, you really have to love John Schneider and the ""hunter"" in the movie. Visual effects are totally unbeleivable, but the movie has comedy and some lessons to be learned in it. I rated it 4 stars only because John Schneider is such a great actor. 5 stars would have been a bit much since the visual effects were not good. Cloris Leachmon plays a strange lady and gets hers in the end I guess. If you like John Schneider, you will like the movie. Without him, I don't think it would have been as good as I thought it was."
2,Lake Flacid the limp noodle,The only thing i liked about this movie was the girls and they werent really much to get crazy over.not near as good as lake placid.
3,So-So,"I think I must have picked up this title a few years ago and there it sat on my shelf until now.Good points: There was a plot. There was romance. The characters were likeable. It was a quick read.so-so points: The sex was rather tame for a story taking place at an ""exclusive gentlemen's resort"". I didn't much care for the sexual language used...there are ways to write hot, steamy and kinky scenes without overusing less than flattering terms for female sex parts.The Possession was just ok. I've read better from Jaid Black."
3,It's ok,"This was ok. Wasn't really what I wanted it to be. The plot seemed to be really quick and to the point, didn't give you much to really get into the characters and care about them at all. Sex scenes were a plenty, but didn't really leave me satisfied!"
1,Predictable,"Out of all the erotica books I've bought recently, this was my least favorite. It is very predictable with little character development. There are turns it could take or possible surprises, but it is a typical romance novel with very little real BDSM happening. If you like romance novels, you may enjoy this. If you are looking for a shocking and arousing BDSM book, this may not be for you."
3,"Good story, Bad editing","This was a creative story line, but the writing lacked refinement and I could not manage to bond with the characters or lose myself in the book. However, I blame the editors more than the author because the numerous grammatical errors broke the continuity of the story more than anything else."
2,Eh...,"This was on a recommended list for bdsm romance, but the bdsm was practically nonexistent. If the book were longer, or free, I would have given it a higher rating, though. It's a very short read, not giving much time for any character development or to even become attached to them. The sex was okay but nothing special, though it had the feel that if the author put a little more effort it could have been very hot. Jack referring to his member as 'him' was a little weird, as well, and pulled me out of what was going on. Overall, though, it would have been a good read if it were longer and more fleshed out, or at least had a lower price tag."
2,What a let down,The first small part of this book is really hot - then when there is going to be 3 days of servitude - there is nothing - I was VERY disappointed
1,A dressed-up bodice-ripper,"This, some damned way, ended up on a recommended for me list. I love good pornography, particularly BDSM, but this is boring, repetitive, and not even vaguely leather. More like a dressed up bodice-ripper. forget it."
4,Take Me Away,And that is just what Ms. Black does. You are allowed to enjoy another world and enjoy the rise and depth of romance. With a lot moreUMPH! to it. I love how the guy really is in love. Just the basics forhim.
3,Possession Review,"I thought Possessions was an okay read. Krissy is the main h. She feels that she has a boring life and wants to spice it up so she joins the Island for five days. The Island story line I think could have been more realistic if written correctly but it came across as unreleastic. It's a island were men buy women for five days to be there submissive. The women get paid to be there and they have a few days of actives before the men buy them. There was no Bdsm in the book only some light spanking and one scene with handcuffs. The Jack the H is a millionaire alpha, who is friends with the guy who owns the island. He also knows Krissy because of a work project so when he sees her on the island he has to have her. I felt that some of the scenes where hot but I didn't feel for the characters. I just wanted it do be deeper more thought out story then it was."
2,Not Worth It!,"I purchased this book off of the reviews and thought the description sounded interesting, but that was not the case. I kept waiting for it to get better and it just never happened. I would have to say it's average and not worth the $9.00 price tag. If you want something hot and steamy, this isn't it."
1,Worst DVD I've ever seen.,"Don't get me wrong. I like the film. It's pretty fun light hearted stuff, but this is one of the worst video transfer jobs I've ever seen. I can barely read the opening text, I can barely make out some of the shapes, and the whole thing looks like its negative had been sitting in the sun for the last 30 some odd years. Then again it's Good Times Video marketing the thing, and they're not exactly known for quality videos. Both audio and visuals get a major thumbs down in this viewers book. Do your wallet a favor, and don't buy this DVD. Wait for a better version (if there's ever going to be one).Still, if you can put up with all that, it's actually a pretty funny movie. Camels and cowboys. Who would've thought?"
1,Poor Video Quality,"We own a VHS version of this film (which also included a short on the ""Life of Benji"", and ran it so many times it's wearing out. I was thrilled to see this DVD version and ordered it, but we watched it last night and it's little better than our VHS tape. The video is especially bad in the low light/night scenes (and there's a fair number of those) where you can't make out what's happening. The soundtrack is so-so as well (and mono).Nutshell: great family film, awful video quality."
3,funny,this is still funny today as when it was made. the 3 stars just comes from the quality of the recording on DVD. casting is good.
4,Slapstick comedy,"This is a fairly funny movie about a cavalry unit in the US Army that is issued Camels instead of horses to patrol the American Southwestern deserts. Supposedly based on actual events. Funny in a sort of ""F Troop"" fashion."
1,Arabian Nightmare,The video quality on the DVD appears to have been made with a handheld video cam in someone's basement. It is terrible. Many scenes are just plain blurry. Don't waste your money.
4,Camels in a Texas desert,"This show is about a cavalry unit in Texas who are unable to use their horses because of the extremely hot weather, which the horses can't adjust to. The army gives them camels as an experiment, which at first is hated by those in the unit. However, in the end the experiment is canceled, but the soldiers have grown too fond of their camels. Starring James Hampton, Slim Pickens, Denver Pyle, Jack Elam and Frank Inn. Great family movie, entertaining, and clean."
2,Poor quality!,We were extremely disappointed with the quality of this DVD. It was out of focus and blurry through the entire movie.
2,Not what we were expecting,"If you like a movie with very little plot and slapstick comedy, you might like this one. We did not."
5,Very Happy,"My daughter has been looking for this movie for quite a while,easy to find here & product in great condition. Thank You"
1,"Buy this for the photos, if at all","While the photos are indeed a treat to look at, the text is so full of inaccuracies that it best be ignored. I'm not an expert on every one of the Metro systems profiled, but with regard to the ones with which I am familar, I can attest that Mr. Bennett's factual errors are pervasive. Dates, directions, system topology, and more...nothing jibes with the actual facts -- even such seemingly minor things as referring to Washington DC as a ""state capitol"" when I think that many people are under the impression that it is the national capital of the USA...or referring to Ontario as a state when many in Canada, and elsewhere, believe it is still a province. With an editing standard as low as this, it's no wonder the metro descriptions are valueless."
2,Alternate recommendations?,"Hi, I haven't read this book, but I saw it in a bookstore today and was very excited. It seemed right up my transit-freak alley. If it's so full of factual errors though, what better books on the subject would you suggest?"
4,Old-Time Honky Tonk,"Jess Willard is a name that very, very, few know. And it is doubtful that he will ever become a household name. Yet, Jess is an important link in bar-room country music. Jess Willard has a sound somewhere between Jack Guthrie and a raw Johnny Horton. But, Willard's voice is unlike any other; he can never be mistaken for the smoothness of Roy Drusky....for that matter, his voice may not even be as good as Ernest Tubb or Charlie Walker! But, noone else could pull off the delivery of such songs as ""Buy Me a Bottle of Beer"" and ""Drinkin' at the Bar"". This is yet another Bear Family release, and like all of their products, it is packaged and presented perfectly. B+"
2,This thing is freakin' huge,"When I pulled this mask out of the box, all I could think about was how gigantic it was. I can deal with it being lopsided. But now I'm really having to consider being Dark Helmet instead of Darth Vader this Halloween. Why couldn't they have made one from the Revenge of the Sith mask???"
1,Do yourself a favor and DO NOT BUY THIS!!,"The picture looks really good..The fact that it is cast from the original studio prop; sounds great...The truth is, this Darth Vader Helmet is just a HUGE plastic,cheap looking, piece of crap! THIS IS NOT A REPLICA....I sent mine back for a full refund..DON'T WAIST YOUR TIME..."
2,"Excellent size, poor quality","First, ONLY buy this mask if you possess good quality craftsmanship to remodel & recontour half the mask and just basically shift the right part of the mask 1/4 in. back toward the left. Thats how warped this thing is. The original actual movie Vader mask did have a slight uneveness to it, but not as nearly to the extent of this Rubies edition. The helmet or (dome) contour lines are equally as bad, but overall the basic shape and size is satisfying . With the proper devotion and a good amount of skill and the (eye) for beauty and accuracy,( a must !!!!! ), this cheapy Rubies ABS monstrisity of a mask can be made to resemble a highly sought after Don Post fiberglass edition which can even surpass that."
1,"So going around gibberish, more like it","What holds Mr. Berrigan's poetry back from greatness? The same thing that holds back a sales receipt from Kentucky Fried Chicken. There is, simply, no poetry in Ted Berrigan's poetry. What deadened his sense of acumen so I cannot say; he surely had access to the steadfast verse of his closest inspiration, William Wordsworth, but whereas Wordsworth's verses puff with gusty brilliance, Berrigan's crinkle up like burning paper hats. He must have read John Berryman, for Berryman's influence is everywhere apparent, but he has maintained none of Berryman's awareness of the majestry of language. And, while I have read in critical journals of repute that he read many French authors, Ted Berrigan does not display even the faintest tinge of Continental eloquence or dignity. A pitiable effort."
2,Buy used,I bought the book used and am glad I did so. The book was a quick read and very interesting at the start but by the second half it became more about how great Mcdougall thinks he is and less about the outdoors and cabin building.I was suprised that Mcdougall could fit thru the cabin door with the ego he sports.
5,Great Book!,"I am currently building a Cabin and found Len McDougals book intresting. Whatever his publisher paid him for this story could not be enough money for me. Having previously lived in Michigan for 23 years, it brought back some fond memories of both camping and the bugs. I will most likely purchase another one of his books."
1,Waste of money,"I was very disappointed in this product. I found it wanting to unhook from the strings. Then, it broke after a mere hour of playing! I have read a mix of reviews on these with some players having similar experience as me and then some loving them."
2,Nvidia is a better choise,"As an Architect and tech fan (i use complex programs like 3D studio, Autocad 2009, Impression 2009, Photoshop and Power DVD for Blu Ray paly back) i was very disappointed with ATI, first i purchase one of this, secondly i purchase another one and put in the CROSSFIRE in a capable motherboard (ASUS of curse) and the power never surpass my expectation, the programs about i talked never surpassed the performance i needed. In Linux (ubuntu) the 3d Hardware acceleration is Not Capable and this is a very disappointed from AMD-ATI. After a time i Purchase an NVIDIA Quadro FX1700 and is another story... with Nvidia all SHINE and WHISTLE in your computer..."
2,Not Worth The Money,"Nothing special about this video card. My old nvidia 6150 did okay, the only thing was that i couldnt turn up the graphics/antilaising/animorph up. I only saw some improvments. I play alot of Counterstrike source, and with this card, it looked better but ran somewhat laggy even when settings were set low, and even at 800x600, still lagged a bit. I have a 2.5mghtz dual core, with 2gigs of ram, so my system shouldnt have any problems running this thing. Im going to return it and spend the extra 80 bucks for a decent card. Dont waste your time and money with this junk. You'll just spend more money if your trying to get a decent gaming experience on the long run."
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,"My daughter received this doll for her 4th birthday party. Everytime we visited the toy store we had to pry the doll out of her hands so you can imagine how happy she was to receive this doll. The doll is cute and I do love the functions however the head on this doll is made out of this squishy/rubbery material. After playing with the doll 3 OR 4 times the doll appeared very dirty and you CAN NOT clean this material. To top it off my daughter was fascinated by the squishy/rubbery head and was constantly pulling at facial features, she pulled on the nose and it came right off!! There is no way to fix this. Please Please do not waste money on this doll. Stick with the baby born, we've enjoyed that doll for over two years. It alot more durable!"
1,"Horrible, Overpriced Junk","I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. The face is a lint magnet. The dog walks by and the doll needs a bath. It is not interactive. It just goes through a babble, crying, staring cycle. The doll never sleeps (closes eyes) as its supposed to. The only thing positive is daughter potty trained to get this doll. Fortunatley, I can take it back for a better doll and daughter will still be potty trained. Keep your money and stay away from this doll."
5,jessi's review.,This toy is wonderful.Santa brought it to me on Christmas.It makes me feel like a real mommy I got a Baby Born doll carrier. And sata also brought me a suit case with weels and a 3 peice traveling set what iam tring to say is if you have trouble finding a doll - get this one. When it is on it sounds like it is crying all the time but I love this toy and hopefully you will love it too.
1,DO NOT GET,To my opinion chou chou is a great doll. But this one looks like it came out of space im 12 and still play with dolls but this one I think is not good. On the computer its cute but when it gets home its how should i put this........U.G.L.Y. We ordered it from the computer at my grandmas and we returned it the next day. I would choose a diferent doll from chou chou.The thigs the made it ugly1) it look like it had surgery on the top of its haed if you take the hat off.2)its face is not cute it looks like it had a fight3)lint gets stuck on its face so easy you can clean your house with its face.theres alot more resons just look for your selfjust not worth your money unless its at the dollar storeThe good thing its educational it will prepare a kid for takeing care of a baby. But other dolls will to the same with better looks.Hope the reveiw was clear and helpful ;-)
5,"If you love Robin Williams and Holly Hunter, you'll love this one.",An off-beat comedy with great actors (beyond the stars) and beautiful cinematography of a wonderful wide-open place. I love Robin Williams because he can make me laugh and cry in the space of a moment--fine performance.
4,"Oddly funny, black comedy",This has been compared with Fargo. That's a stretch. They are both black comedies with lots of snow and quirky characters.I'm not sure why I watched this. I'm not a fan of either Robin Williams or Giovanni Ribisi but this works. Some of the other reviewers give a good description of the movie so I won't. Basically Robin is trying to commit insurance fraud and Giovanni is trying to catch him. Two hit men complicate their lives.I would watch this again and I hope it is available soon as an Instant Video.
5,Held my attention,"Usually I find that dramatic comedies have a few 'drag' areas, but this one held my attention from start to finish. Holly Hunter is always a 'hoot', but her role is especially funny when paired with Robin Williams. Great casting and great fun!Chrissy K. McVay - Author"
4,Not bad for time-waster.,"Robin Williams is, as always, zany and funny. Add the absurdity of humanity--and it's a fun flick."
3,Lambert really can act...,"If you are a Lambert fan (like me), then you'll be surprised by his performance in this movie. It ranks up with Mortal Kombat in films he actually pulls off well.However, if you're looking for a good story, stick with Highlander."
1,Not a kid but this movie was made by one,"Terrible acting. Whoever said Christopher Lambert can act should be forced to watch this movie over and over again until the truth is made quite clear: HE CANT ACT. Take what could have been a great movie like ""The Sicilian"" where Lambert plays the title role. He is so bad and so unconvincing as the character. I laughed out loud when he tried being emotional because he completely failed at it. As far as this movie goes Lambert sounds like he has laryngitis through the whole movie (even more so than his other films). He has the same expression through the whole movie. I was expecting a bad movie but this is really bad."
2,"Subpar, hasty adaptation of a decent novel","The Heat of Ramadan, Steven Hartov's first novel, deserved a better film adaptation than this low budget, poorly edited disappointment. The plot was very promising and you could sense the potential. Perhaps veteran action film director John Glen (The Wild Geese, The Spy Who Loved Me, Moonraker) ran short of time, money, or talent.For a better film on international terrorism, try instead The Little Drummer Girl, directed by George Roy Hill in 1984 and based on the novel by John Le Carre."
5,A Look at Christ through a different Glass,"This book was very exciting for me. Alexander and his son Hero, illustrate that, regardless of how lost we are, or how far we might have rejected Christ, He will always accept us back into his fold, with UNCONDITIONAL LOVE.Again, this series is remarkable."
1,Bull.,"I agree with John Davidson, the Thoenes need to finish the Zion Covenant series, then we'll talk about me buying new series, until then...NO."
1,Tired of this,"Its time for them to go back and finish the zion covenant series, instead of forging new series, they need to complete unfinished work!"
5,Wonderful series,These books make the scriptures take on life by explaining the times that they are set in. I am truly enjoying them.
3,Nice package; Nice workout; But Rough Bands,"I got this book to extend my rubber resistance training. It's the only book on the topic I found at Amazon at the time. I was interested in the book but when it came and I saw the 2 small blue rubber bands attached, I was happy that it was an inclusive package. You didn't have to go out to buy the exercise equipment now that you had the book. I tried out much of the exercises and they do feel good. However, the rubber band feels harsh in my hand after a while and I have to do the exercises with my exercise gloves so I don't burn or chafe..."
4,ARGENTINE/AMERICAN'S DELIGHT,"If you've ever been to Argentina or wondered about this country's mystique and charm as well as it's silent horrors; If you are an Argentine- American or an American-Argentinian, you'll be caught in a whirlpool of memories, backflashes, cooincidental identifications, and you'll almost think the book is about you. Unger is not a master, but a keen observer and a captivating storyteller. I couldn't put El Yanqui down and finished it in a day."
3,Insightful but not easy reading,"While Ms. Shatzmiller's provides a vast amount of historical information regarding the history of Islam and Bosnia, getting through this book is a challenge due to the heavy language and writing style of the author. Admittedly, she has chosen to address a complicated topic however what I had hoped to be enlightening turned out to be a chore. As a result, much to my disappointment, I have yet to make it through to the end of this book, nor have I gained the insight that I had hoped to from reading this book."
2,Description Deceiving,"This product is not a full Batman suit. The chest pad is made of a thin layer of foam and there is a cape attached. Although Halloween costumes are usually not durable, I question how long this one will last. I will have to compensate for the full suit with some black pants. The best part about this costume is the mask. It is the best Batman mask by far."
5,Bediquette-Bedtime Manners,Where was this book when I was thinking about getting married? This would have saved my marriage! A great read for new brides and grooms and even married couples! Every marriage counselor should own this book and tell their clients to read it. I loved it!
3,NAMES THROUGH THE AGES,"Although The Volume Arrived In A Dented Condition Due To Improper Packing On The Seller's Part, After Thumbing Through The Book, I Found It To Be Amusing As Well As Interesting. This Book Might Be Of Value To Individuals Interested In Etymology Or Genealogy. I Recommend This Book. Sincerely RSPG/DK"
5,Traditional Yup'ik Narratives,"This book is a wonderful bilingual collection of traditional Central Yup'ik stories. Includes the stories in English and Yup'ik (on facing pages). Probably best suited for those with some background in Alaska Native cultures (esp. Eskimo cultures), though it does include some cultural background. Great book!"
3,kind of cheap but it works,"not something I would use at a job site, but it works fine to keep a spare belt for use around the house, or to lend to the neighbor."
2,Needs a better buckle.,"This is a good belt, so I thought. I used it several times until the buckle kept coming undone. I finally gave up when I it came off while I was on a ladder 12 feet off the ground. I threw it out for safety reasons."
5,Definitely Different,Do not often do a puzzle less then 1000 pieces but the shape and the colors fascinated me. The pieces are oddly shaped and you need to think about where they must go. I enjoyed this puzzle even though it didn't take long to complete. It is beautiful when done. Highly recommend to anyone who does puzzles to try this one.
5,"Still ""Great"" after all these years.....","Great updates of some of the Beach Boys best. Some new things too. Truly expresses the title ""The Warmth of the Sun"" in so many ways."
5,beach boys 2007 new release,I purchased this for my dad who is a huge Beach Boys fan. He says they never sounded better. The updated sound to those good old oldies is great and love hearing their new music.
2,Sounds Of Summer It's Not,"Don't be confused by references to the great Beach Boys CD ""Sounds of Summer."" Although the tunes are extremely well remastered and edited for excellant sound quality, they are much more obscure then the songs on ""Sounds of Summer."" I am a Beach Boys fan and I only recognized a third of the tunes on this CD. And half of those because they were someone else's hits. I enjoyed many of the songs I had not heard or had forgotten but this is nothing like the hit after hit of ""Sounds Of Summer.""So, unless you are a big Beach Boys fan on a limited budget and haven't purchased all the Beach Boys' albums already (or such a Beach Boys freak you can't stand to live without every recording), I would say most listeners would be better off passing this one up."
1,Lackluster,"There are very few really good songs on this CD. Most of these songs must have been the ""B"" sides of thier hit records because neither I nor any of my friends had heard most of them. Even after listening to the CD several times, it still didn't ""grow"" on me. I real waste of money."
5,The real significance of this album is...,"Brian Wilson and the Beachboys collaborating again. Brian did his own album(s), DVD, and was gigging with other musicians. The Beachboys have been gigging without Brian. As a Beachboy's fan, I think it's great they got back together. This weekend was classic, wooden boats all over Lake Arrowhead. I bet they had fun there, at Brian's house, cruising in his ""California Girls"" speedboat, as they met discussing this retrospective. Between this release, and the Stone's ""Bigger Bang"" 4 DVD set, this is going to be a great summer for classic rock. I would agree with most, that the band's best material came before 1970, but I also liked ""Surf's Up"" from the early 70's. Since the Stone's are still writing good songs, perhaps the Beachboy's could too? I will especially enjoy hearing a remix of ""Wendy"" because a beautiful girl with the same name was once a true love of mine. Please, don't tell my wife! LOL."
2,a little late,"Subscribed here thinking this would be a much easier way to manage it each year. Its really no saving over ordering direct from the magazine. only problem is that i entered my subscription on Nov. 9, 2011, expecting first issue 60 or so days later. Won't get first issue until March 9, 2012. seems a tad long to wait."
1,Naming of stars DISCONTINUED,It would have been helpful if this was indicated in the item description by the seller. The company who makes these has advised on their websites that these toys have been discontinued and naming the stars is no longer an option. It's the whole reason I got this stuffed animal and we are very disappointed.
4,well made knife,The knife is very well made for the price (which didn't cost me anything we received an amazon gift card for a survey we completed) however the shoulder holster i wouldn't recommend it hardly fits my 16 year old son but overall very pleased with this
2,OK,"This was my first Pelecanos book. I found it OK, not great, for the reasons previous reviewers mentioned, including the one-dimensional characters. The transfer to kindle was sloppy, at times with typos so frequent they became distracting."
4,"Good story, great characters","In ""Shoedog"" author George Pelicanos nails the Washington DC of the 1990s as the background for his entertaining story of the planning and execution of two liquor-store heists that include hard-boiled characters and a dark eminence pulling the strings. I've always thought that Elmore Leonard was the best at this kind of crime writing, but ""Shoedog"" demonstrates that Pelicanos has the same chops and feel for the genre. As a DC homeboy, he certainly gets the geographic and cultural details right for the novel's context. The book's protagonist, Constantine, a 35-year old drifter, is well-drawn and credible. The story's ending is what it should be, but comes as kind of a shock.A good read and certainly one that encourages the reader to try other Pelicanos novels."
4,Noir in DC,"Pelecanos takes a break from the Nick Stefanos series to tell the noir tale of a drifter who, while simply hitching a ride south, gets caught up in shady dealings with deadly consequences. The protagonist, Constantine, is extremely similar to Pelecanos' Nick Stefanos (and even spends a night in Stefanos' bar) he's a loner, able to hold his own, at home with the underbelly of society and a keen sense of what is right and wrong. He gets caught up in with some petty criminals and their controlling boss and ends up in a sticky situation. As usual, Pelecanos uses Washington DC and environs as a backdrop for this gritty little tale."
4,Pelecanos has to be one of the best modern noir writers,"This isn't quite one of the author's best, but it's a good tale of a drifter befriended by a senior hood and subsequently involved in a couple of what should be easy and bloodless liquor store robberies. Naturally, if these robberies went as planned, there would be no story.The territory is overly familiar and predictable, but the author's style and depiction of the underside of our nation's capital city save the novel making it well worth reading."
4,Lovin' this new CD,"It's great hearing Miami Mass again. As in their past releases, the Miami ""flava"" is present especially on the songs ""Worthy To Be Praised"" (for the praisers who love to jam), ""Hallelujah Anyhow"", ""The Storm Is Passing Over"" (featuring Dorothy Norwood) and the title cut ""God Will See You Through"" w/ a added reprise which includes their hit ""It Is For Me"". Also, ""Don't Take Your Spirit"" caught my attention as well being that it's a freeform kind of song w/ no tempo. Man, it was refreshing to hear songs like that again (cause not too many choirs sing them anymore). Reminds me of Benny Cummings a little. I'm sure you'll enjoy this CD just as I have, so check it out!"
1,This is a Duracell???,"Not sure, it came with paperwork indicating it was made by BatteryBiz. Not sure if they make these batteries for Duracell or not. The battery did not come in Duracell packaging, and it was stamped with white lettering rather than the gold lettering shown. Either way, I charged this up for a few days, put it in the camera and it sat for two days. When I went to turn on the camera the battery was drained! Not acceptable for me since the Canon batteries would last forever when the camera was off. I sent it back! Amazon was great about refunding my money, they are great for customer service!"
2,Will not hold a charge that lasts as long as Canon,"This battery doesn't hold a charge for anywhere near as long as my ""old"" Canon branded batteries. I have to recharge them as often as batteries that are nearing their end of life cycle. I thought that Duracell brand would be better than the ""no brands "" I bought once before that were nearly useless. Back to Canon only I guess because battery life is very important to me."
1,Junk.,Lasted two recharge cycles. Will not take a charge. The original Canon battery lasted four years and many recharge cycles. Recommend against purchasing this product.
3,ok,When ordering this item I looked at the picture and what I was sent didn't look like the picture. I already had 2 old batteries one that looked like the picture which the battery last longer The ohter one I had is like the one you sent me and this battery doesn't last as long. I was hoping it was the longer style battery.
1,"So bad, I can't help but laugh!!","Yearning to hear the songs I learned while on a Study Abroad trip in 1995, I purchased this CD. This is the most horrid version I have ever heard! First year language students could do a better job at pronunciation. Every song has a garish, obvious mispronunciation. The most annoying one is their version of ""Kalinka"". They do not pronounce it ""Kaleenka"" (long e) they pronounce it ""Kaleeneeka"". My advice to anyone who has taken more than a semester of Russian is to keep searching for a better CD. I know I will!"
1,A parody?,"I - a Russian! - could do a better job impersonating Bob Dylan than this fellows - pretending they are Russians... And no, it's not only ""singing"" part: instruments, sound, arrangements are truly aufull! Do yourself a favor - buy ""Stars of St.Petersburg"" CD, it's the real deal, don't waste no money on this parody..."
2,Gustavo Ferreira Russian Music,"I found this CD not very good. The arragments developed by the ensemble wolga are commercial and not very good. I think are not close from the real spirit of these Folk music.I also had bought at the some time ""Balalaika Favorites"" that is an excelent compilation and excelent played. I realy recommend this one, not the first one."
2,Disappointed,"I am sorry that I cannot give a review. I ordered this CD for my little grandson's birthday as his mother is Russian but, when it arrived at their home the case was empty...no CD. I hope my family in St.Brelade, Jersey, were able to contact you and sort this out.Anna."
3,Miles Davis turns electric. Jazz fusion is born,"I recall one review that described Bitches Brew as 'the shot heard around the world'. The album itself is a frenzied jazz soup, winding electric guitars playing off of each other, trilling keyboards, slinky basslines, and powerful driving percussion rhythms. But if there's one constant, it's the reverberating echoes of Miles Davis' horn. Yes the sound may be cluttered compared to earlier cool jazz, but the genius of 'Bitches Brew' is the spirit of improvisation, allowing the band to communicate with each other, through back-and-forth type musical banter creating a language that is dense and complicated, at the sametime lush and beautiful. Only Miles Davis is brazen and crazy enough to create something this daring and unconventional. 'Bitches Brew' is the powerful force, innovative and revolutionary, by which all electric jazz recordings were spawned from."
3,EH-lectric,"For Jazz alone, Thelonious Monk is simply better. For Jazz Fusion, Krautrock masters like Annexus Quam or (especially) Wolfgang Dauner are better. I think this is another case of the origionator being outpaced by his followers. This is a good album for rebellious librarians, not a good fusion album."
2,Bad Idea,"Miles is a genius, but every genius has a bad idea,and this is very surely one of them. I'm petty sure he convinced this all-star cast of musicians to contribute through his rather weighty reputation, but that' no excuse for putting their stamp on this sonic disaster. Listen to it once or a thousand times,it doesn't make any difference. It just sounds like a group of patients all suffering from some degenerative neurological disorder who have been given unfamiliar electronic instruments for some type of bizarre therapy.Every one of these guys has made some pretty incredible music on their own; I suspect some of the younger cats learned from this experience but that certainly doesn't excuse the sum total when it comes to this unbridled catastrophe. Two stars for the pedegree of the performers, otherwise zero....."
5,really great album,"I WISH THIS ALBUM WAS AVAILABLE 'NEW' FROM AMAZON!UNFORTUNATELY I BOUGHT THIS FROM A STREET VENDOR IN SOHO & THE RECORD WAS SCRATCHED ON THE LAST 2 TUNES! I PURCHASED ANOTHER 'USED' COPY HERE WHICH IS IN BETTER SHAPE - I SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN IT HERE FIRST!Anyway, I really love it, and I am very happy with it. I especially love track 3, I play it every morning before work!"
2,Dated and badly........,"I remember listening to this album when it was first released. The hippie heads told me this was ""jazz"". Well it really wasn't then, nor is it now, and time hasn't been very kind to this album either. It sounds very dated in 2005; hell by 1973 it sounded pretty badly dated for that matter. This might have been a soundtrack for the Woodstock kids who finally made their way home from the festival, but to the rest of the world this should be little more than the link between Miles' classic 60's acoustic jazz and his fusion classic Jack Johnson released in 1971 and his other electric fusion work in the 70's as well.I can't even imagine buying this album in the expanded box set either. Why would you want to? I mean I have a ton of respect for Miles Davis, but Bitches Brew was a product of its' times, and those times are long gone. Contrary to what Columbia tells you on those stickers found on every Miles re-release....this is NOT a ""classic""."
5,the mother of all jazz fusion,"At the intersection of cool jazz and psychedelic rock, one of the greatest and influential albums ever recorded. This is where jazz fusion came from, which in its early days was one of the most creative styles around. Not to be confused with the electric jazz-lite muzak of today.What the Beatles & Sgt. Pepper are to rock, Miles & Bitches Brew are to modern jazz. After this band split up the members went on to form Weather Report, Return to Forever, Mahavisihnu Orchestra and Herbie Hancock's Headhunters.The jazz purists hate this album. Essential in any collection of creative music."
4,This Album gave Birth...sort of...,"This is a must have if you love Miles Davis....or Herbie Hancock...or Wayne Shorter....or Mahavishnu John Mclaughlin.or.....or..or...get the point. This was a new chapter in modern/progressive jazz...with Miles experimenting in differant sounds and textures....also led to the advent of ""world music"". Along with the title track""Bitches Brew"" is a must have 2 cd's full of some of the best jazz you will ever hear.The album also gave birth .....sort of to the groups ""Weather Report"". Herbie Hancocks""Headhunters"" and numerous other jazz/fusion groups that went on to enjoy worldwide regonition. Also introduced the world to Mahavishnu John Mclaughlin who went on to enjoy success playing alongside Carlos Santana on the album ""A Love Divine"" a rare but really differant turn for Santana,also worth taking a listen if you are INTO it.................the Toad"
5,Mind Blowin,"Purchased the album when it was originally released.At that time in my life it added to the state of mind I was in as a result of mind altering chemicals. As I listen to it today, chemical free it's still "" Mind Blowin ""."
1,Work of Art...Ruined By Ham-Fisted Echo in Remix,"It infuriates me that apparently nobody seems to notice...or nobody cares...but if you've ever heard the original version of this album on vinyl, or on the original CD release, you know that the echo on ""Pharaoh's Dance"" was originally one of the highpoints of the entire album. I mean, it was even mentioned in the liner notes. In this remixed version, however, the echo effect is hopelessly out of sync, rhythmically incorrect, and sloppy sounding.The losers who remixed and remastered this important work of art should be ashamed of themselves. It seems that they completely disregarded the way the echo was applied so tastefully on the original, and have just sort of slopped it on in a horrible way on this new version. And now of course this is the only version you can find (on disc anyway). If they weren't smart enough to get it right, they should have left the track echo-free. Miles would be furious.Why not just paint a mustache on the Mona Lisa?"
5,yeah cosmic jazz funk oddyssey,"First of all to like this you must be open minded,I felt this from day one but for some your taste must be abnormal or you must be a fan of Sun ra, hendrix, Sly Stone, and p-funk to catch on, cause Miles was listening to a lot of Jb, sly, and jimi at the time but these songs kicks ... man big time. Miles combined afro caribbean vibes and made a funk opus, cause this is funk maybe Miles was behind the times but he caught up and took jazz to a new direction very few can comprehend, yes this is hard to understand for some if you are not open minded but one listen i caught on,just picture jazz from a egyptian-cuban vibe i can expain this all day but still this ia a classic. R.I.P. MILES dAVIS."
1,very disappointed,"This three disc set has very few songs, some of which are not audable.The third disc does not even play in my CD player. It reads error every time.Vey poor quality"
1,Whats This?,"The First disk is terrible. No beat just random blows of the horn its awful. 2nd disk, not that bad"
1,This CD could have been improved with a good trumpet player,"Do not be intimidated into pretending you like this recording because you might not look cool. The main problem with this CD is that it is boring. Here's the formula: Take a has-been trumpeter who has lost his ability to play and add tons of reverb to his anemic solos. Add a bunch of great musicians who are all ten times better than the leader, but intimidated by his horrible personality. Let everyone jam without any direction. Give the CD an ugly cover and a stupid name. Defy anyone to be objective and realize what a total waste of time this is."
1,"It's Just Noise, Don't Bother","As the previous reviewer from South Carolina stated, this album is just a bunch of disconnected noise. It's not ""jazz"", it's not ""fusion"", it's not anything...it's just a badly recorded drug overdose.The folks here who gave it 5 stars and gushed over it are just trying to be hip and want to believe that they ""get it"". There's nothing here folks, and I bet Miles had a good laugh at the joke he pulled on everybody, the record company included."
3,OK,"You know what? I've listened to this two CD set multiple times, and I ended up taking it to my local CD store for trade in credit.Not that there aren't some good moments, but there aren't enough of them to justify its inclusion in my more than 200 CD collection.If you like ""fusion"" I would check out the Chick Corea/Return to Forever Compact Jazz disc (available only via used, I think).Miles is a wonderful guy, but that doesn't mean you have to buy this. Besides, he's dead, so aside from his beneficiaries, who cares?"
4,A masterpeice likely to fly over the heads of the close minded / musically conservative,"Miles Davis was always known for being an experimental artist, but when he released this in 1969, many people were confused. Wheres all the melodies of ""Kind of Blue"" or the cool feeling of ""Birth of the Cool""? Well, it was just another step forward in the evolution of Jazz, which, for better or worse, brought in Fusion. The album may sound like a mess on first listen, but it isn't. Miles Davis put a good amount of time into conceiving this album, which he hoped would change Jazz. They aren't merely jamming here, it's all part of a greater purpose. In addition to creating Fusion (probably my least favorite style of Jazz), the album also set the blueprint for Funk-Jazz. Herbie Hancock as we know him today wouldn't exist if it wasn't for this album. This was probably the last great Miles Davis album, but it is one of his best, and therefor a must-buy for his fans."
2,Miles behind,"After listening to this the first time, I thought Miles had gone mad. A few more listens later I still think that Miles was mad when he made this record. The first CD is pure noise. The second CD though is somewhat better. I especially like the short track ""Mclaughlin"". On the whole, `Bitches Brew' is definitely overrated.I would prefer the pre-fusion works of Miles. Anyday.Sanjiv"
1,Collecting dust due to nausea,This game never gets played at our house. I have kids from 5 to 12 years of age and no one likes this because it is visually disorienting. Anyone looking on becomes sick to their stomachs in just a few minutes. Solo play is the only option with this one. And its just not fun enough to want to take it off the shelf.
3,Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,The game is a lot of fun for my kids. It is a little chalenging at parts for my younger kids but that makes it more fun.
5,I love this book.,"This book is great...even a novice like me can creat amazing dishes by following this book. Betty Crocker shows you the easy way to roast a turkey and prepare the side dishes and desserts that go with a Thanksgiving meal. Thank you, thank you."
5,B.C. Thanksgiving Cookbook,This will be helpful at Thanksgiving for years to come. I'm so glad I have it. I don't have any cookbooks devoted only to Thanksgiving.
2,Not what I expected.,"This book was full of off-the-wall recipes. Being a Betty Crocker cookbook and advertised as the Complete Thanksgiving Cookbook, I figured the recipes would be more traditional. I was disappointed."
4,The go-to bottle when severe thunderstorms strike!,"We have tried several products to help our youngest dog cope with his anxiety when thunderstorms approach. (He also struggles with fireworks.) I'm not sure how much the other products have helped, but he never completely calms down until he has a spoonful of this. I can't bear to give it the highest ranking only because it seems awfully expensive and he really doesn't seem to like the taste. (Yes. He is spoiled.)"
5,We love these books!,The illustrations have a lot of detail. They are beautiful and fun to study. The stories are fun! There is lots of humor. We especially like Willy the hedgehog. He is always so hungry! I am 9 years old and my brother and sister and I love the Foxwood books. We wish they would print them again.
4,Classic Car Chase / Gun Fight Scenes as Real as Hollywood Gets,"DeNiro at his best in this post Cold War thriller. Whatever is in the case, (Is it the same stuff from Pulp Fiction?), ruthless people want it and are willing to do anything to get it. Great car chases (rivaling, if not exceeding Bourne trilogy) and realistic gun fight scenes underscore a reasonably paced storyline. Recommended, definitely not a chick flick."
4,Innocence Goth,"A Goth twist on the Grimm brother's classic, this Gretel is the sword-wielding daughter of Mr & Mrs Sakazaki, who own the only grocery store in a small town surrounded by mountains. Her twin, Hansel, the more diplomatic of the pair, sports a tin-can for an oxygen mask (he is the ""brain"" to Gretel's ""brawn""). Everything goes well in the pair's life until the grocery store's suppliers refuse to sell Hansel & Gretel's parents any more food for their store. Armed with Gretel's sword and a mission: The twins search for both the answer to this mystery -- and something to eat!I like Mizuno's colorful, yet Goth characters, which are both charming & a little frightening! 128 worth-reading pages (not including the paper dolls & sticker sheet). Rated ""M"" for mature. Adult manga readers who like this will also enjoy her other classic fractured fairy tales: Cinderalla & Princess Mermaid."
5,heartfelt writing,"I think this is a really terrific collection of monologues. The editors have found writers with a really great range of styles and voices. One piece called ""A Picture Hook"" was amazing. It was strong and heartfelt and so true. The entire collection features very unique talents."
4,great performances,"Compared to the Amar-Hindemith quartet playing Op.22 all other performances pall. On the other hand, this quartet's performance of Op.22 is the second best recording I've heard so far, which is good if the competition is Hindemith's own performance. My only quibble is that they take the middle movement a bit slow (but everyone else takes it a bit slow, too).The best works are the Op. 22 and 32 quartets and his last quartet, which he wrote to play with his wife on cello. Some of the novelty works and the transitional quartets don't grab me (the third and first quartets mainly) but at his best Hindemith's quartets are equal to Bartok and Shostakovich for emotional power and stunning chops.This CD set is actually back in print but reissued with different cover art and at a slightly lower price. Snap this one up if you see it."
3,Short and sweet,"It is a very short book. Being a board book, we expected that. But for the price we paid, we were hoping for a little more inside. Overall, it was average compared to the other military deployment books for kids. I wish they had more that werent so specific on army personnel though."
1,rhyming needs a bit of work,"The author hit the highlights of what a deployment/TDY will be like. Unfortunately the rhyming (or lack thereof) was a bit ""off"" and it is actually painful to read. The illustrations aren't very appealing, either, and my 2 yr old rarely picks this book at storytime."
3,Good for child,I call this the sad book because it makes me sad to read it while my husband is away. Of course my child seems to pick it ALL the time and I read it because I want him to want to read about Daddy. I have to agree that the rhyming and rhythm of the book are a bit painful but my child doesn't care so it's great for him.
3,This book is great!,My little girl really enjoyed me reading this book to her. Another book we loved is Speak Through Me: The Diary of a Military Brat. They both help us cope with Daddy being away. It makes it a lot easier to explain to your little one.
1,"poor quality, unfortunate","This book has a nice sentiment, but the writting isn't great and the images are **TERRIBLE.** Seriously, I've never seen such bad illustrations, ever."
5,Amazing! Amazing! Amazing!,"Best Friend Forgotten is so amazing! I saw this movie on PBS and fell in love with Clover and Oreo. Thank god this show was made. Also, David Duchovny is awesome as the host. Way to go David! My favorite part about this film is that it's range of emotions it provokes. There is comedy, suspense, drama, sadness, and happiness! I also found it to be very informative, I learned so much from it. It's really cool that it didn't give opinions and force me to feel a certain way. I definitely feel that I got to make my own decision about how I felt about Pet Overpopulation. Also, I really felt inspired to get involved with volunteering at the local Animal Shelter. I really have nothing negative to say about Best Friend Forgotten, which is strange, because I always find some fault and problem in movies I see."
5,"Buy now, these are the last ones available","Obviously, best film on pet overpopulation. If you can get people to sit for 27min you will have changed minds. Reach the masses."
5,LOVE IT!,"I love this booster! Its safe, comfortable, easy to use, and easy to clean! Highly recommend any Britax products!"
5,Excellent!!,"Very possibly one of the best intros to the subject of Romanticism ever written. Full of info, and insight, the book covers the high and lows of the movement that influenced Napoleon, Beethoven, Kant, etc. Sweeping thru several countries, and numerous art forms, including music, literature, and theatre. One is introduced to the high wire tension of the Romantic, forever trapped between the Unreal (primal nature) and the Real (Civilization)."
2,Long winded indeed!,"As usual, M. Lerner has wonderful ideas. But he hits you over the head with them in ""Spirit Matters"". So, one, this reader, begins to wonder about the author's aim? Does he practise what he preaches or does he preach to hear himself preach? Does this spirituality on-the-page rise from authentic practise? Are these words full or empty?It's hard to know. I have read several of Mr. Lerner's other books, notably ""Jewish Renewal"". There, and here too, after overcoming the sea-sickness his prose style begets, I have to wonder: Is his focus on selflessless real? Does He find God in everyone he meets, as he suggests? Something about the tone of tenacity and endless loquacity in ""Spirit Matters"" has the quality of protesting too much. Lerner is exhaustive, yes, fine: but the writer is equally: Exhausting. Closing this book, I wondered: Does he walk the talk? Or does he just talk (and talk...)?I'd give this book 1 star except that the ideas, however wordily conveyed, are good ideas."
2,Disappointed recording.,The sound effect is almost similar standard of the 33-1/3 black rocord age. Hardly distinguish between instruments playing.
4,A must if you love Tchaikovsky's music,"...anybody who loves Tchaikovsky's work will enjoy these two fine performances.The video and sound are very good, not CD but there aren't that many choices around so don't be picky!The two young soloists were great, a couple of little mistakes here and there, but... I wish I could play like that!I would recommend spending your money on this DVD."
4,Mauling,Well there were parts of this that were pretty interesting and there were parts of this that were simply mediocre. In several parts I felt like I should have felt more tension. Tracer had the potential to be an interesting villain but ended up being a plot device more than anything else. The best part was where Spider-Man has his near final showdown and gets mauled as never before.
2,Pulp.,"I love Peter David, I love Straczynski, and Hudlin is fine, but this feels like a big add for each participants other works. You really find yourself not caring for any of the characters. It was a road to hell littered with good intentions."
2,"Spider-Man, Spider-Man...What Did They Do To You?","This collection completes Spider-Man's origin change from science-based to some sort of mystical garbage. He gets some new powers here, which we're told he's ""had all along."" How Peter Parker overlook some of his spider-based powers such as organic web-spinners shooting from his wrists? Or night-vision? Or the ability to detect airflow changes with the tiny spider hairs covering his body?Peter was the original science nerd-turned-superhero, and I find it difficult to believe that he would have ""overlooked"" these amazing powers. The neatest power is his ability to shed his skin after ""dying"". I had a tarantula that did this every couple of years, and it's a pretty cool concept to apply to Spider-Man.Unfortunately, the execution here (over 12 issues by three different writers) is choppy and disjointed. It's tough to make a comic in which Spider-Man has an eye friggin' ripped out boring, but that's just what Marvel has done here."
2,"Good if it only costs you 20 bucks, otherwise don't bother","I bought this for 29.99 plus tax, I guess that's retail. In all this hardcover is not worth the retail. You get all 12 issues and that's about it, no real extras to speak of, other then a two page spread of variant covers and short bios on the book flaps of those involved in Spider-Man: The Other."
3,Well written but strange,"This is well written and the art is great, but the whole Spider totem thing JMS had going during his run was a bit weird and something that is basically ignored by the current writers."
5,Reviews in 20 words or less,Compelling storyline creates an emotional roller coaster revolving around the death and rebirth of a classic hero.
3,Good though not what I expected.,"To me the first 5 volumes were either decent, good, or great. *Loved volume 4-5 the most* Where's the following volumes felt a little weak when comparing. Because the whole feeling of the previous chapters kinda died away. And the conclusion doesn't seem complete here.All in all it's entertaining but without spoiling to much. It could of been better."
4,High Quality but . . .,"The only beef I have with this set is the retention rubber. It does an excellent job of grabbing the head of the plug, but the rubber tends to stay with the plug, not the socket. This is no big deal unless you have an engine with deep cylindrical spark plug shafts where no needle-nose pliers can reach (like my 2001 Toyota Tundra). And obviously this is only a problem when installing the plugs.However, I was able to solve this problem with a littleHenkel 235522 Loctite 0.2-Ounce Tite'n Nuts and Bolts Locker. I'm sure epoxy would probably work, too, but I didn't have any handy. It was solid after about 10 minutes (I was antsy to get my plugs changed), and the rubber has since never come out.Great quality, but 4 stars for the need for glue."
2,Not impressed.,"I bought this set of spark plug sockets to change the plugs in my Nissan Pathfinder. I thought the price was great, considering that a lot of other places charge as much or more for a single spark plug socket. I bought this set because I was unsure what size my spark plugs were. If you have no need for multiple sized spark plug sockets, there is no need to buy this set. The size I used was the 5/8"" socket. The first spark plug was no big deal, worked great. After that, every other spark plug that I replaced the rubber stopper inside the socket very easily slipped off and stuck to the spark plug. When you have a spark plug that is located in a place you can't reach with your fingers, this poses a big problem. I ended up using a different socket to finish the job. I would have sent these back, but the cost of shipping to return it would have cost me more in the long run. Also, the box arrived damaged and wide open."
2,Not so great,Rubber don't stay in the socket and would get lost when sticking to the sparkplug! Probably good for removing plugs but I can't use it to install plugs! Never had a set do this! Wonder if superglue would fix the problem!Or maybe cutting the top so that it don't grip the sparkplug top!
5,Start with the Basics.,"Dewey Markham has been able to bring the so-called ""complicated"" wine to the most basic level. The book covers topics from Why to drink wine to what is a vintage.My favorite section was the taste areas of the tongue: sugar, tannin, acid and sweetness. This was very informative on how to taste the wine and what to look for when tasting.The wine label section was very well presented with the various labels I always get confused but this section in the book goes over the various forms of the labels.Overall this book was an easy and informative read. If you want to start understanding wine I recommend this book as your first step.Have fun reading and drinking."
4,Django is alive and well,"John Jorgenson plays in the gypsy jazz style of French guitarist Django Reinhardt and The Hot Club of Paris. He's very good. This recording has all the bouce and life you'd expect in this style of music. I prefer the tracks where the backing is simpler (a couple have bigger orchestrations). I love what he does with the old Shadows hit ""Apache"" - it really shows what this style does to a tune! Enjoyable."
4,Readable biography of Battle of Britain unsung hero,"When you think of the Battle of Britain, what do you think of? Dashing young officers with public school accents flying Spitfires? Well, try reading this book, and discover that one of the finest fighter pilots of the war was an auxiliary pilot from Yorkshire, whose favourite aircraft was the Hurricane. James Harry 'Ginger' Lacey was flying aircraft from the beginning of WWII (winning a Croix de Guerre during the Battle of France) to the end (first Spitfire over Japan) after the surrender. The book is well written and nicely illustrated and gives a fascinating picture of what life was really like for a fighter pilot. Recently updated from the original (published in the 1960s) it also tells of the rest of this man's flying career before his untimely death in 1989. He was a real hero - I should know, he was my Dad!"
1,Unlikable characters,"A friend lent me this book and I was encouraged to read it out of my desire for plausible storylines and relatable characters in this genre. I couldn't have been more disappointed. The conversation is predictable and ridiculous, and the qualities the characters display make you began to wonder why these people would have anything to do with each other. I really wanted to like the main character, Jane Lawless, but she is someone that cannot be related to and who too often has events conveniently fall in place for her. Her actions make you think she feels entitled to do what she wants by believing in her excuses for constantly putting aside basic principles and expects the other characters to believe her excuses too (they do). These are the kind of people you steer clear from in everyday life, in all situations possible, and in books.I had always thought I would rather read anything rather than have nothing to read...I was wrong."
5,Wonderful,"I was very pleased with the content of this book. The composers history was accurate and interesting, although for a more thorough look into their lives, you can supplement with additional books from the library. The CD that came with it was great to have. My kids love learning from this book!"
4,"A ""Must-Own"" for Anyone with Asthma!!","This book is an easy-to-follow discussion of what asthma is(in layman's terms, NOT all medical jargon)and how to successfully handle it. Topics discussed are such as: finding the ""triggers"" to your asthma problem (i.e. food allergies, environmental allergies...), making the most of the least medications, holistic treatments that might help, how parents can help their children...and the list goes on. Of all the books I have looked at on this subject, this one seems to ""cover all the bases"" without being too bogged down. A quick, easy reference."
4,Romantic Comedy,"It was because my wife and I wanted to watch a movie together that I got this one. It looked a bit ""alternative,"" and turned out to be a pretty good romantic comedy from Australia. Honestly, I had my doubts at first, but it turned out to be a very enjoyable film."
3,Silly but a fun ride nonetheless,Get this if you are a fan of Rhys Ifans. He is funny once again in this role in his own goofy sort of a way. A couple of good supporting roles also by Justine Clarke and Miranda Otto. The storyline is obviously silly but fun at the same time. At the very least it is worthy entertainment.
5,Aaaaawww...,"That would be the word I could not stop saying while watching this movie. It is one of those rare, precious romantic comedies that is actually both romantic and funny. Since the plot has already been discussed exhaustively, I not waste anyone's precious time by rewriting the screenplay. Miranda Otto is adorable as Glenda, reinforcing the opinion I formed after watching the Lord of the Rings trilogy; that is, she can pull off just about any role. The rest of the cast is also excellent in their respective roles. The supporting characters are quirky and fun, but never to the point of upstaging the action. This one is a keeper!"
4,Praetorius without his crumhorn,"If you've been put off Praetorius in the past by the liberal use of flatulent period wind instruments and harsh percussion, you might try this fine recording. Strings, bowed and plucked, take the spotlight here and the result is very pleasing. Hyperion can always be relied upon to provide nice sonics and the performers are in excellent form. Some might prefer more demonstrative playing, but the slightly laid-back approach here is highly enjoyable and sounds totally valid."
1,Unmitigated Noise,"This album is nothing but unrelenting noise that grates on the senses. I can't believe an online ""professional"" reviewer gave it 4-1/2 stars. An aspiring horn player on acid might like it for its offbeat technique, but otherwise it has absolutely nothing musically to recommend it. Some may call it improvisational jazz; I call it unlistenable trash."
3,Christmas holiday through the country of Mexico ....,"The author, Elizabeth Coatsworth, was known as an international traveler, which influenced her writing. This is reflected in this seven-chapter young adult novel as the main character (Daisy) visits Mexico with her parents and older sister (Emily). Daisy discovers the Mexican culture. Some of her Christmas-time vacation experiences include visiting: (1) the church in Mexico City which houses the Virgin of Guadalupe, (2) the church that tops the great pyramid of Cholula in Pueblo, and (3) Monte Alban in Oaxaca. A young adult would need to have some general knowledge of Spanish terminology / customs to fully appreciate this novel."
5,"the best for star gazing beginners, even adults","well, especially this adult, who had no clue that plants did not follow along with the stars. Love the author and this was a good starter book. got me to subscribe to Sky and Telescope, though it is way over my head. (!)"
5,Love it!,"My mother-in-law had an old paperback copy of this that we borrowed for our child to do a book report with. We LOVED this book! I wanted a hardback copy for our home, and scored! It has updated info, which I was very pleased about. It's just a fantastic book for kids (and adults) who are just getting into astronomy-star gazing. It has very kid-friendly terms and illistrations that really make it easy to go out and check out the sky. Great book."
5,Great service,"As usual, I only get the best of service and the fastest solutons to any problems I might encounter.Herb"
5,teach this unto thy children,"I've long been a fan of Rey's (of Curious George fame) The Stars, a New Way to See them, but that is a bit more complex and geared towards adults and advanced students. This book is ideal for children and parents alike because Rey breaks down the major constellations one by one and draws them so they look like real pictures, not like those horrible drawings in the NY Times and other publications. His lion looks like a lion! The text is very basic, easy to follow and explains the basic astro stuff like stars, planets, magnitudes, but not much more. The major reason to buy this book if you already have his other book is for the handy sky charts. Unlike his more advanced book which has an entire sky map, this book as more handy ""sky view"" charts which are an easier way to learn the night sky. Another winner from H.A. Rey that anyone can profit from if interested in learning the stars!"
5,Daniel MacIvor IS modern Canadian Theatre,"House opened my eyes to the work of MacIvor and set the standard for contemporary Canadian theatre. Victor's rants and theories are both entertaining and engaging for an audience, and both challenging and rewarding for an actor. MacIvor thrives in the intimacy of smaller theatre spaces where the audience has no choice but to be affected by the action on stage. If interested, be sure to read See Bob Run, Never Swim alone, Here Lies Henry, and MacIvor's most recent play Marion Bridge - his most sincere work so far. Great to read, wonderful to perform, and unforgettable to witness. Also, MacIvor fans may look for the new independent film adaptation of See Bob Run by Calgarian director Don Scott!"
2,Not a page turner,"I'm surprised this book has a sequel. It was not that interesting. I am a politics buff so I thought a chick lit novel set against Washington would interest me, but the story never presents any captivating moments or characters."
5,Become Successful,"This is a must have for ANYONE who wants to be the Best they can be in the world. Doesn't matter what you want to be you'll be the BEST! And know why, But you will have to really read and understand this Book. You'll be lead to great things if you trust."
4,Good info and excercises,"I'm not a fan of the ""Law of Attraction"" in general, but I think this book has merit. It's got some explanations and exercises for getting one's mind in the right frame for cooperating with the forces that be, in any case.The only trouble is that it's very badly written. It was originally meant to be a weekly mail-order course, and maybe it worked better in that context. Each chapter begins with a brief argument, then several paragraphs of short statements to reflect on, then usually a weekly exercise, and finally a Q and A that's really a summary of all the paragraphs that made up the bulk of the actual chapter. There are several chapters where the weekly excercise is the only information of real value it provides -- perhaps an abridged version of the book should be released."
4,Before The Secret,"Great book though it is not a ""quick"" read. Meant for each chapter to be read in weekly installments, which is a good idea overall to absorb the information. Worth it to know a more indepth proseperity philosophy."
4,"An essential ""must have""","I think Haanel's work trumps Wattles work. The eloquent language and the beautiful prose of this book makes you feel romantically enraptured with the concepts of meditation and visualization in a way no other author has. This book is older so you may find it more of a laborious read than some of the books of late, but if you want to really master practices like employing law of attraction to create your life and visualization to attract what you desire you have to learn meditation - that's just a fact.Haanel talks about the ""sun center"" - which is the solar plexus in other words, and he explains the power of Light and how to quiet your mind. These concepts and practices are a must if you want mastery - if you want to be a successful law of attraction practitioner.This is the quintessential ""how to"" for all life mastery practices."
4,The master Key System,"Enjoyable and educating! This product has given me a new way to live my life. Excellent product, highly recommend"
5,great book,Harder read because its an old book but if you adapt to this way of thinking you can achieve anything.
2,Good information...Horrible reader!,To each his own. If you can bare the sound of the reader's voice and monotone intonation then this is a good audiobook. Otherwise you will find that you cannot focus on the material because of the strange voice. It's not the monotone quality that bothers me the most... but there seems to be a nervousness and almost whininess- something very unpleasant about the voice used to read this. For me it was like nails on a chalkboard and it literally brought chills up my spine listening to him. I can't focus on the actual material like this.
4,good book but more of a list rather than a read,great book but the format is not very readable... it's essentially a list of how the author proposes to unleash your life ... good advice.. just not very easy to read
1,Terrible Format,"Its hard to believe Amazon would sell this rag. The Format and font design is so bad, you can't read it. It looks like it was typed on an ancient typewriter. The font is extremely small and the entire book is in ""bold type"". It all runs together, very difficult to read. Single spaced, the inside margin is less than 1/2 "", so you'd have to pull-llll the book apart to read. Horrible!This is going back!! I'd have to question all these 4+ ratings...."
5,Mr. Charles F. Haanel Master Key System:,"If you are into this sort of thing; that is, self-development at all cost, even though this book was written in the early part of the 20th century, it is very much appropriate for people who are interested in self-evolution - self-development, in 2007. It explains in very clear, concise terms how to go about getting what you want at a deep level in a ""weekly lesson format"". As within, so without.I have been reading and searching extensively for the last 30 years and I do not hesitate to recommend this book very highly."
4,"Inspiring and insightful, easy to read","The Master Key System by Charles Haanel is a fantastic book for anyone looking for inspiration to improve the quality of their life. A previous review states that this book is hard to read because of the size of the font used, but I encountered no difficulty. At this price, you get a real bargain for the amount and quality of information offered. This edition is a definite improvement compared to the other editions out there - it has been polished for grammatical correctness and contains four additional chapters that no other edition has. I'm very satisfied with this book."
5,Excellent,"I've graduated the School of Hard Knock with various degree's when all along I've known these principles to be true. If anyone is interested in excelling at ANYTHING that is a desire your heart longs for please do yourself a favor get Haanel's book and reap a reward that will not only help you obtain your desire but fuel any other desires you have. This applies to ALL regardless of your beliefs, background, or education."
4,Stuck Between Parallel Dimentions,I am currently suspended between two parallel dimentions aparently in a very deep meditation induced trance. This is a great way to escape the turmoil of the times. Only one chapter did this to me. One can only guess what will happen upon finishing the book. Let me sleep a while! A very good book and investment.
4,Most precise education for law of attraction yet,"I have begun reading heavily on the mind and the power of the subconcious. There seems to be alot more new out there that just ""touches"" on this phenomenom. This book seems to put a logical spin on the illogical or the sometimes unexplainable, something I enjoy completely. It is hard enough to begin to understand and use the psychology of the mind and the spirit and this book zeros right into the places you need to work on.It is interesting to note that the original author wrote this book many years before this idea even became as popular as it is today. That seems to offer some credibility to me about whether this stuff is real or not."
1,Not the Original Text as Advertised,This is not the original text. There are references to VCR's and Cellphones. No telling what else has been altered.
2,Not that great.,"I was not very impressed, after having read other reviews, I expected more. Think and Grow Rich or other books do better job in my opinion."
3,Difficult to understand for the laymen,"This is an excellent book if you are versed in the ""law of attraction"" thought process. If not, i would not recommend this before reading a preview of the basics in the ""law of attraction."""
2,The Master Key System,"The principles are great. However, it was not as logically thought out as I had anticipated. Not well written."
5,Life changing book,"This information comes from ancient times and I feel is the main philosophy of the world. If everyone lived by these laws, this world would be a much better place."
5,This was my first copy of this great work!,"Funny, I bought this long ago and did not read it - shame on me. I then went to a course and bought a copy that was part of the system they were selling (it was fantastic and very good to use) and using this new book reminded me I had this old one. I'm going to donate the old one to a friend.They are all great!This is the one from the course if you are wondering:The Master Key System: The Personal Study Edition"
5,A rather useful layout in a quality product.,"I used this apron extensively during my last deployment to Iraq. I loved the fact that I could have all my measuring tools, tooling, pens, scribes, doodads and whatsits on my person, without having them be a jumbled mess. It made learning using a lathe and mill much easier since I didn't have to fumble around looking for stuff. Granted, that's not all this apron is good for, as the general layout is conducive to any sort of small tooling and gadgets one might need for a wide assortment of hobbies and jobs. The quality is very good, as the material is thick and durable and is sewn together well. It also washes easily, which I was surprised to see, considering it did get covered in oils, rust, and other assorted effluvium one encounters in a fabrication shop in one of the worst environments to be working in."
5,Incredible!! 10 Stars!,"Judith Hall manages to deal with some unpretty topics (anorexia, cancer) with amazing smoothness and grace. ""Monarch's Birthmark"" is the most endearing and precious piece that I have come across in a long while; ""The Other Girls in Lettuce,"" a startling and complex one that I have read so many times I might be able to recite it. A must read for anyone who loves poetry or for anyone who is looking to improve their own writing."
2,I bought a medium size and received a large size,"I bought a medium size and received a large size, I was delighted with this purchase and this disappointed me"
1,Terrible product,"I purchased this belt as a replacement for my old valeo VRL that I lost. This belt was half the thickness of my old belt and the suede lining was coarse. Not soft like my last one. This belt offered no support and felt like I was lifting with a piece of cardboard wrapped around my waist. I only used it once and gave up on the workout. Everything about this belt is cheap. Nothing like my old one. Instead of this, buy the Grizzly padded belt. Just like my old valeo."
1,Tried to return item due to wrong size,"Item is good but not the people who sell them, i contacted them via email and explained how do i go about exchanging item for a different size and got no reply, its been over a month and no reply."
2,Not what I expected.,"Judging from the title, I was expecting a book which would give practical advice and resources for raising an intellectually gifted child. Even though I was surprised that the ""gifts and talents"" the title refers to are in areas such as ""sense of humor"" and ""social consciousness,"" I tried to appreciate the book anyway. After all, it is true that all children have some ""gift"" or area of excellence, whether it is in an academic area or not. However, I found the book dull and lacking in useful advice. I got very little out of it. At the very least, they should change the title to reflect the emphasis on social talents."
4,Be Who,"I have been searching and searching for Be Who. I had it years ago, but can no longer find it. If anyone know where I can get this CD please contact me. BigRed3504@aol.com"
2,Be aware...,"If you are considering buying this, be aware that it is a ""period"" performance with the keyboard part played on a fortepiano, not a modern piano. I enjoy period performances of baroque music (in which the keyboard instrument would typically be a harpsichord), but what works for Bach and Vivaldi doesn't necessarily work for Mozart. OK, so this may be closer to what Mozart would actually have heard himself, but if he could have heard a modern piano perhaps he would have preferred it! To my ears, the fortepiano sounds thin, almost comical - perhaps worth hearing once, but not for repeated listening. So unless you are really into it, I would look look elsewhere."
1,Didn't have good luck with this scanner,"Scanner arrived and I scanned a total of 6 slides before the power supply quit working. I wanted another one sent but after waiting 4 weeks, Amazon cancelled the order and said they were unable to get a replacement. Amazon was not the problem, Konica/Minolta was."
2,might want to consider Minolat 5400 instead,"I got mine yesterday. I made a few scans. The biggest concern I have is that they are not really sharp. I think the 5400 focus button is of great value here, and seems like a fast solution to get scans in focus. I decided against the 5400 because I read so much about the ""green lines"" problem and the higher price tag. Now my unit is defect as well. 2/3 of the slide is in normal color while 1/3 of the same slide is in different color ( this was for all slides and all scans ). So I am going to return it and try the 5400. Finally about the comments below with the blinking green light. I cannot say for sure but this might be an operator error. The scanner needs to be booted like a computer. It boots when you start the scan utility and only then you can scan. That being said mine is defective as well so it might not be the best model on the market. There was a time when people did QA......."
1,KonicaDiimage slide scanner,I bought the scanner after extensive search on the internet and asked a few frieds who are computer savvy.I am extremely disappointed with this scanner. This is my first scanner and I thought it is a piece of cake once I got the stuff. However the scanner would hardly ever scan one slide with out causing trouble There were more error messages than work done by this machine. Also the companion booklet does not give the meaning of error messages .Over all I am extremely disappointed and do not know whom to call for help.Krishnamurthy
3,Good equipment for the price,"Although there are some glitches and infrequent freezes in the software, it is a good value for the money."
1,Didn't work,"I believe that the scanner that I received was defective. The software that shipped with the device wouldn't recognize it. It also seems like the scanner would lock up during set up, then power itself down and would not come back on without unplugging/replugging.Returning for replacement/refulnd."
5,This is an awesome scanner!,"Seriously, for the price, this is such a great scanner. It's also easy to use, it was easy to set up, it couldn't be simpler."
2,Slow and images are flawed with 'white' feathers/lines/dots,"I received this scanner yesterday and immediately started scanning. Set up was easy by following procedures from the manual.Scanning speed is slow, I scanned only 16 negatives in 2 hours, most of the negatives took 2 or 3 tries to scan because I always see flaws resemble white feathers/lines/dots. Because of this, batch scanning won't work since I need to rescan the negatives. My negatives are newly developed films, they are not even old. I also selected the dust brush, grain reduction, and auto correction. Wonder what's wrong....Will post updates in the future....."
2,Oh Well,"I tried everything to get it started but did not scan!I finally called a Senior Tech @ Konica Minolta imaging andhe claims item could be defective, so I sent it back.Nervous about re ordering another Dimage and having a problem with this item, I purchased a Canon CanoScan 8400f two days later and I have no problems at all! So I was never able to seehow good it could have been, Oh well."
4,It's a good one,"I've had this now for two days. I've already scanned in 280 slides, and could not be happier with the results. The batch scan is a breeze and it makes feeding them in so easy. My main problem is STOPPING and going to bed when I should. The one common complaint about the fussy startup is one I share. When I first set it up, I did everything the manual said to. INCLUDING not starting software until the light stopped blinking. It blinked for a LONG time, and nothing. I was figuring I had a bad unit, but then tried starting the software to see if it would respond at all. Soon as the software started it went on steady and I was able to scan. Too picky of a start up which is why I only gave 4 stars. The quality is EXCELLENT. I was very hesitant to buy this at first, but am SO glad I did now. It's been great fun rediscovering the memories that have been buried in the trays for too long. Making them usuable again, is well worth the $265."
4,Satisfied,"I have had this product for four months and have scanned over 5,000 slides and negatives. I am happy with the results and versatility of the unit.It works as advertised and I am still learning new ways to use the versatile software, which is based on Photoshop Elements.The software is great when it works and the user knows how to deal with it. It is not very forgiving nor tolerant of odd conditions. New users will be frustrated if they don't spend the time to learn it.My unit [or the product] has a defect: every 500 scans or so it just hangs mid-scan. The software cannot deal with this and it hangs as well, sometimes even crashing Windows [not that difficult, but I did note that the software is not robust]. The only solution is to pull the power plug on the hardware and re-start.In summary, I would recommend this unit, warts and all, and would buy it again."
2,Poor Mac Support,"What little scanning I have done so far ( between constant freeze ups ) has been good. The problem is that it is constantly freezing up on me. I have a new Apple G5 dual processor running OSX 10.3.8 and I can only get a few slides in at a time. I have tried calling Minolta numerous times but it has to be done at their convenience. I work full time and have difficulty contacting them at their specific working hours. They sound sympathetic on the phone but my scanner still does not work proper. The one time that I did get to talk to a technician he had me unplug all other USB devices because he said the Scan Dual IV does not play well with others, I did not read that in the owners manual or sales literature. I'm not to fond of having to unplug all of my other USB devices everytime I want to scan. What happened to being able to use up to 127 devices on the USB bus. All said, I should have sprung for the Nikon and saved my asprin."
4,Slide scanner,"Takes a while to learn to use, but it is worth the time. Resulting digital images are as good as it gets, especially if you select the highest resolution. ONLY drawback - processed about 1200 slides, and then the slide tray broke. KONICA Minolta charges your $40 plus shipping for a piece of plastic worth about 50 cents! The salesperson, however, send me two trays for the $40 plus, one redeeming fact."
5,DiMAGE Scanner,Scanner does a great job on 35mm slides. I'm scanning at 3200 DPI and can make 11x14 prints with no grain. I am concerned about the durability of the drive motor as it acts like it is slipping once and a while. Not enought to be positive yet. Otherwise I'm Happy with it.
3,Design flaw,"The DiMage scanner worked great for my needs-presentation and personal photographs. The color and scan quality was acceptable. However, after around 1000 slides the machine stopped working. Since it was out of warranty, I opened the case. I found that as the slide carrier moves it drags a cable accross a screw head. This abraded through the traces on the cable. I have not been able to get a new cable and will have to send it Minolta for repair. I am concerned that after another 1000 slides I will have to have it repaired again."
2,"Yikes, the software and support really *are* that bad!","For the money, I suppose this is a good scanner, but...I read several reviews that complained about the software. I figured ""These people are just too lazy to read the manual."" Then I bought one and found out for myself. Trouble. Besides frequent freezing on a Macintosh which required restarts to get it to recognize the scanner again, it also refused to remember settings for batch scans. I'd set up the contrast parameters, save it as a ""job"" description, and try a batch scan. It would ignore the saved settings use the (too contrasty) default settings, producing very harsh scans from B&W; negatives.As others have noted, there is no tech support. There is a web page where you can submit a question, and then you will never receive an answer. All in all, the troubles made it a useless doorstop for me and it went back."
2,You (Minolta) tell me!,"As a scanner, it works fine, albeit a little slow for the hi-res scans, but what do you expect for < $300? On that score, I'm satisfied.HOWEVER... Here's the rub.Every time I turn off the machine, I have to reload the software to get it to work the next time. Otherwise, all I get is a flashing green pilot light and a bunch of error messages from the software. The troubleshooting guide offers no help nor solace, and there is NO 800 NUMBER SO I CAN CALL MINOLTA (ARRGH!!!) They say I'm supposed to call my dealer (AMAZON!!?? Are you kidding) or distributor (which they DON'T list)GIVE ME A BREAK!If anyone out there can help me, please send me an email.I'M DESPERATE!! (YOU HEAR THAT, MINOLTA?)"
4,A good value for entry level film scanner,"I was skeptical about this purchase because of numerous bad reviews. Since I was using a Visa Gift Card from my company, I stuck it out there and proceeded. I also purchased the 2-year protection plan. The scanner was no problem to set up. I followed the instructions as advised. I have a project to scan about 1200 slides. I am about 200 slides into the project and the scanner has not missed a beat. I will send an update revuew in a few weeks."
1,Get an other one!,"Upon installation the scanner worked great. After two weeks of rather light use the machine started to slow down, it became louder, and finally it stopped working. Considering all the other reviews, describing similar issues, I'd suggest to Minolta/Konica to seriously redesign the mechanics of this product."
1,Not worth buying this product,Not worth buying this product. Almost whole book was filled with pencil n had to erase it which took couple of hours.
3,Fundamentals of Englsih Grammar,"This product can be wonderful, but to do wonderful to need how complement Fundamentals of English Grammar (Third Edition) of Betty Schramp) fer Azar (the book that was wrote for Betty alone)."
2,It is so old book.,It is so old. The book with lots of writing. Before the book is wet. Even the surface looks very old.Last page was also been ripped up.
4,Good book,Good book for learning english language grammar. Bought as a gift for a friend learning english. Three books in the series.
1,"Santa, WHY?","Having Leslie Nielsen in ""Santa Who"" is the reason we got suckered into getting this turkey, and really, I wish he had known that if he needed a job that bad, we would have let him sleep on our couch until he found a decent gig.Santa Who is a made-for-TV movie that gives made-for-TV movies a bad name. It has every trite cliche and every bit of bad writing you can think of. It has children that, if real, would make people everywhere realize that reproducing is evil. Adults that are less than one-dimensional, and stupider than a box of really stupid rocks. Bad pacing, dumb situations... and worst of all, during the time I watched it (before my rising stomach made me turn it off) nothing funny happened! There's nothing good about this movie.Don't waste your money or your time.(I'm ignoring the other movie on the disc, ""A Chance of Snow"". Proceed at your own risk.)"
4,Santa Who?,This was a gift but I imagine it was very good considering Leslie Nielsen was in it. Don't you think so?
3,Good copy,I haven't seen this one yet but plan on watching this weekend but I'm sure it's a good one we will see.
1,IT LEAKS!,This thing could electrocute small children and large adults because water leaks on to the floor from the bottom of the unit. The owners manual states that you should place a piece of plastic under the humidifier. It is also noisy and squeaky.
4,Greenhorn Review,"My computer skills are limited, but this book was recommended to me by a knowledgeable friend as a resource. I am using it that way, so have not been into it that much. It does have great illustrations and directions clearly illustrated."
4,Windows XP Illustrated,"I found this book very helpful for my husband and I who are not very computer literate! Very, very helpful."
5,Maran Illustrated Windows XP,"I love the ""Maran series"" books. They are very helpful for people who are no computer geniuses, since give you step by step instructions."
1,disappointed,Did you know the boys from Vienna also sing in English? In this album they do. Drat. I should have looked more closely before buying it.
1,celebrate freedom,"although it says it was shipped, i never rec'd the product. Very disappointing. i have been a long time amazon user and this is untolerable."
4,Dust Mask with filters,"The product is well made, but the rubber across the nose tends to be too tight and causes discomfort. Other than that I like them. The head straps are heavy duty and comfortable."
4,Functional,"This case will cushion my laptop, and also holds it shut. The fitting is snug, and the zippers and everything work. However, note that there's no where to put your charger. Also, it's not the prettiest case in the world. And no handle."
5,Unique and Important Book,"This book fills a unique need in the field of plant layout and design. There have been no new texts like it because this field is dying like many of the old plant designers. Particularly important is the emphasis on the relationship between pipe racks and the overall processes.Since we haven't built a substantial refinery or large process plant in the uS for decades, this book serves as the only important reference for all of the 3D CAD newbies out there.My only suggestion is that there is not enough discussion of electrical layouts - especially the effects of DCS systems on equipment placementThere should be plans for a newer and updated edition"
4,A good thriller,"I think the previous review is WAY too negative. I found Shaiton's Fire to be a good read -- an exciting, believable page-turner."
5,More than a memoir...,"Living a Year of Kaddish portrays one man's search to come to terms with the loss of his father. But it does more than that: it shows, with vivid and stirring vignettes, how the most painful pages of a life (divorce, estrangement, and death are some of the ones Goldman grapples with) need not be turned with the bitterness of a victim, but can be read with the openness of a student who is willing to learn, and to grow. Goldman is an Orthodox Jew, and as the title of his book makes clear, he draws first and foremost on the religious and cultural traditions that have shaped his family for generations. But he does not write for fellow believers alone. A keen-eyed observer with a gift for distilling the universal from the particular, he speaks in terms that will resonate with a wide and varied readership."
3,book review,"I bought this book after my father passed....I'd read the review awhile back and thought it would be appropriate. Although very specific to the ritual and experiences of mourning, not as poignant as I'd expected....I found it interesting though, and would recommend it...passed it on to my brother"
5,Happy customer,"I am very happy with my new stainless steel food mill. I love to make apple sauce, and this handy tool makes it so quick and easy. I like that it is stainless steel also, which cleans up so nicely. I appreciated the quick delivery of this item as well, since it was coming to me via a friend and needed to reach him before he left to visit me."
3,NEEDED MORE WORK,"WHEN PRODUCT ARRIVED, WAS NOT ABLE TO UNTIGHTEN SCREW AT BOTTOM TO TURN HANDLE. TOOK IT TO A COMMITTEE MEETING, BUT NONE PRESENT WAS ABLE TO RELEASE SCREW EITHER. SON, A MACHINIST, DID SOME WORK ON IT, AND NOW WORKS FINE. WITHOUT HIM, I WOULD HAVE RETURNED IT AS DEFECTIVE SINCE HANDLE WOULD NOT TURN, AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN USELESS."
2,wish I had read the reviews before ordering this item,Didn't read the reviews before ordering this item and forget that again.The mill might be fine for apples...but it's useless for raspberries. I didn't notice that it had only one grade of milling. Big disappointment...but basically my fault.
2,Unhappy with this Food Mill,I bought this food mill and there was a defect (center hole was punched off-center) so I returned it. The new one left small metal or chrome flakes in the baby food I was making. Not good! This is not a quality product.
1,Broke after 2 cranks,"I purchased this food mill to make tomato sauce out of my homegrown tomatoes. I quartered the tomatoes, and put them into the food mill, and cranked it twice, and the handle broke. I put it back together (I'm pretty handy), cranked it again a few times, it broke again. Needless to say, I was really disappointed. The best thing about the transaction was that Amazon let me send it directly back, they paid the shipping, and my account was credited quickly. I bought a different brand, and have had no problems since."
1,Broke after one day,"My mother-in-law got this for me since I was getting into canning. I used it one day, to make applesauce and tomato sauce, before it broke. It's flimsy, cheaply made, badly designed and creates lots of waste. I'm looking for an old one now, from back when companies took the time to make products worth something. Very disappointing."
1,DO NOT PURCHASE,"This food mill was a gift from my sister... I feel bad she wasted her money. She gave it to me for Christmas, in the box as it arrived from the shipper.I am not going to tell her of my experience as I do not want to hurt her feelings and she does not cook so I do not fear that she will purchase another. I do need to tell you because I want to prevent you from wasting your money. Information is critical for competition.I opened it, went to make pommes puree, and it was broken. Already. I never got one full use of it.DO NOT PURCHASE THIS FOOD MILL. It is good for nothing, except wasting money.Let me say again, DO NOT PURCHASE THIS FOOD MILL!"
2,Milling for miles,"A food mill is essential for making applesauce. This food mill proved itself worthy, although taking it apart to clean it proved to be a chore. I'm not sure if it was meant to stay together or not. From my own experience with food mills, if you don't take them apart to clean them, the trapped nasties will contaminate your next food milling festival. It did come apart, and it did get put back together without too much of a strain."
2,"I used the foodmill to prepare applesauce , the center of the mill fell out.",Foodmill is very cheaply made. It fell apart while making applesauce.I cooked the apples until very soft. While I was processing the apples with the foodmill everything was fine then the center fell out. So I returned it.
1,Not the outcome I would have wished for,"I assumed this cleanser would be great since I am familiar with this product line. That was not the case. By the second day, my skin was exteremly irritated and enflamed. I had to send this back"
4,A good starting point for students of Hinduism,This book provides an excellent basic analysis of Hinduism. Hinduism is an incredibly complex religion but Zaehner outlines the important points for the reader.
4,Remote switch,"This is a good basic wireless switch and works well. With more than one unit, make sure they are of a different letter (A, B, C, D, etc.) otherwise it's a problem."
2,"It works, but not well.","I got this item so we could have a way to turn on a light in our garage from the side door as the idiots who built our house neglected to do this. The switch works, however, if you don't use it gently, it doesn't work. It's as if it is super sensitive. So don't try to turn it on or off with your elbow when your hands are full."
2,Flimsy,"The product works as advertised, but I just found the equipment to be flimsy. The whole thing feels like it will fall apart in months. Sometimes flipping the switch doesn't activate the signal - you have to giggle it around a bit to make it go. I have actually figured out how to turn the outlet on and off without even moving the switch all the way down - by just giggling the switch a bit at the top I can turn the outlet both on and off."
4,almost perfect,"got this light switch for a child's room and it has worked out. plug in a battery (not included) in the switch, plug a light in the socket which plugs into the wall: instant light switch. only issue I have found is that on occaision, the light switch will be flipped without a response from the light plugged into the socket. This means that if the switch is placed on the wall, sometimes you'll have to flip the switch up to turn on the light while other times you'll have to switch it down. Not a huge problem at all, just not perfect. Would certainly purchase again"
2,Cheaply made!,"It works however switch does not alway make contact,so you have to move switch up & down at times to turn on or off."
3,"Works good, but...","So far, I'm enjoying this switch. It has made it more convenient to turn on the lights in my living room, which has no wired lighting.However, I'm not enjoying the company, Heath-Zenith. I was in need of a second switch transmitter, but not a second plug-in receiver. I want to have two switches to control one lamp. The company refuses to sell the transmitters and receivers separately. If you want two or more of either transmitter switch or plug-in receiver, you have to buy the whole set whether you need them or not.I am returning this switch as soon as I find another switch made by a different company which is more flexible towards its customers' needs."
2,"Good for 1 month, then...","I ordered this from Amazon on Nov 10th, received 3 days later.For one month, it worked pretty much flawlessly. Now, I have a similar phenomenon as others... If you switch it on or off, at a very random interval, it will just swap (off, or on). I have come home at night after turning it off when I leave for work, and it was on. This is not only a waster of energy (small waste but still) but could even be dangerous (depending on what you're using it for!).What's worse, I thought it had something to do with the battery, a connection issue, or the switch had a problem... so I totally removed the battery. it STILL did it. That means (to me) that the issue is with the plug part, not the switch part.I will try to contact the company, because if the light switches on and off whenever it wants (as it is doing RIGHT NOW as I write this), it's essentially useless.I know at least 4 others had this same review point. Hopefully they found a resolution?"
1,Not Too Good,"Doesn't work very good, as several flicks of switch needed to actually connect on or off.My old ""Handy Switch (tm) works much much better. Will have to see if they still available."
3,Works as Advertised BUT...,"I've gone thru a couple of ""Handy Switch"" units (as seen on TV) and they broke not to mention recalled due to being a fire hazard. Thus, I decided to spend the extra $ and buy this unit. It works and has proven durable. I also appreciated that it used a simple 9v battery. HOWEVER, this unit randomly turns on. This flaw limits what kind of appliances I use it with."
3,Not Dobie's best work,"I don't think this represents Dobie's best work. I especially enjoy his ability to pick out the essence of a particular character. These are hackneyed old traditional stories, skillfully retold, but lacking that personal touch that sets apart some of his other works."
4,Good Chemistry,"This is a good Sci-Fi, Action, Horror/Vampire Movie with tough characters, even the women hunters who are cool with attitude. This is what movies are made for, to enjoy and I hope more viewers enjoy this Heavy Metal, Vampire Future, WILD RIDE through the Universe kicking tail!"
3,Entertaining Sci-Fi Actioner,"In 2210, mineral rich planets are cleansed of Vampires by a rag-tag group of Corporate Mercenaries. This interesting blend of Sci-Fi, Action and Horror, plays out like a lost episode of STAR TREK, though it has been updated to contain gore laden imagery. One might argue that it also has the swagger of a Western in a Sci-Fi setting, replete with the half breed guide, (a Vamp/Human in this case), who was brilliantly played by Natassia MALTHE. Though not without misfires, other credible performances were delivered by Joe LANDO, Dominic ZAMPROGNA and Michael IRONSIDE. Natassia MALTHE, however, stole the show as the Kate BECKINSALE-UNDERWORLD like heroine who wears black leather and kicks inter-galactic Vampire butt. An interesting and entertaining blend that is worth checking out!"
3,Vampire,Picture quality good. Story line needed some work. Not really scary but good movie for a Friday night with popcorn.
3,Vampire Wars: Battle for the Universe,"IF YOU LIKE VAMPIRES,S MOVIES THEN YOU MUST WATCH THIS ONE I REALLY ENJOY IT AND I WILL RECOMMEND IT."
2,Average Futuristic Vampire Movie,"Second movie in the boxset. Originally titled Bloodsuckers, This movie was pretty average. It is kinda boring in some parts but there is some good gore effects, but they're not great though.The movie takes place in the year 2210. Vampires have pretty much taken over the whole world. The V-SAN (Vampire Sanitation) Squad, which also has their own spaceship and is lead by Churchill, who is captured by the vampires, recieves a message from an Earth and the team, formed by Quintana (Played by the very hot Natassia Malthe), the rookie officer Damian and the rebels Rosa and Roman (Roman being played by Aaron Pearl from Wrongfully Accused.) V-SAN later meets up with the leader of the vampires Muco, played by Michael Ironside from Total Recall. He has no plans of living peacefully with humans, as he is bent on world domination.While this movie was not a waste of time, I doubt I'll be putting back in the DVD player anytime soon."
5,"Wonderful set, but we NEED THE REST!","It's been years since Butterflies - Series 1 & 2 were released on DVD here in The U.S.. What I can't understand is that there are two series to go before the DVD collection is complete. Two seasons & one special. Where are they???? The waiting is ridiculous! I have e-mailed Acorn Media to enquire about the remaining seasons coming to DVD & have not heard anything back. I will try yet again to get another e-mail to them.[...]I strongly implore all fans of fine british comedy & Butterflies, to let them know we want all the rest of the episodes & can be as stubborn as necessary till we get them. I can see a couple of years between releases, but this length of time is insane.Anyway, yes, I obviously highly recommend Butterflies (seasons 1 & 2 & the rest whenever they are put to DVD)! ;-)"
3,DVD,"Picture quality is not as good as it should or could be, but maybe because of the time it was produced (1970's) it couldn't be reproduced to enhance the quality??? Otherwise, I am enjoying this DVD."
4,Nice piece of work,This intermediate level textbook does an excellent job of covering the subject. DeLong writes well. The book requires the requisite introductory macroeconomics background and some facility with algebra and mathematical functions. Those not possessing that background will most likely find themselves frustrated because of their lack of preparation. Anyone who wants to take their knowledge of macroeconomics to the next level should take a look at the book as a potential guide and source.
4,"Men's LaCrosse 3""","These shoes are well insulated, waterproof, and very warm. Maybe a bit too warm for gardening, which is what they were bought for. Other that that, they do what was expected! Easy on and off. Very comfortable. I'd buy them again, just don't expect them to breathe."
4,"innovative, easy to use","This is a uniquely innovative tool. While the pda pen concept is unlikely to catch ongenerally, it works very well in this context. In fact, working with the classpadwith its pen interface is remarkably similar to working with mathematica on a pcwith a mouse. There are very well implemented drag and drop and cut and pasteworkflows. And, there is a help website ([...]) with scores ofuseful training videos to get you going. Once the classpad basics are grasped,its very easy to extend to different math functionalities. Please note classpadcomes with a thin protective plastic sheet over the screen area, that--unfortunately--greatly limits visibility. Once the plastic is removed the screenis fine. While this device may not be legal for tests, it is nonetheless veryuseful for doing homework, etc."
2,For those with poor eyesight,"Even though the display looks very bright and sharp in the picture on Amazon, I found it to have poor contrast no matter how I adjusted it. The numbers, characters and symbols are too small for me to read them.I returned the calculator for these reasons. Just a warning for those you over 60 like me."
4,CASIO - Graphing Calculator (CLASSPAD330),"Saw it, ordered it, received it, saved a lot of money on it, no fuss on it, little time spent all up, enough said, thanks ball boys and fans."
1,"Yes, It is true. The display is awful.","I totally agree with the previous reviewer. I removed the protective cover (as suggested by another reviewer), it did not help that much. The only way I can see the screen is when I place the calculator under a desktop lamp.I wasted $150. What a shame."
4,good tiny filter for fry tank,im going to use this filter for a guppy fry tank in a 5ive gallon tank this fulter is good for up to 10 gallons
5,Interesting Book about a Dark History,"Interesting book. The term ""The Evils that Men Do"" more than fits this.It give you insight on what War is and how it goes way beyond the battlefields."
4,Not too Shabby,I needed to do a book review a few years back. I used this for my cultural feminism course. Interesting read and it keeps your attention.
1,Poor quality/Limited foghorn,"This is very poor quality with only one foghorn cartoon...mostly other stuff that looks like it was video cam'ed from a television set. Requested my money back...we'll see. Personally, I'd be embarrassed to sell this duck."
5,This is the way it was.,"This is the way music was at the time of its inception. Going for broke, yet tasteful. Similar in style and approach to early Tull works (Stand Up, Benefit) but with that wonderful vocal styling of Keith Relf. My god, even though I'm a proud American, the English at this time just kept exploding onto the scene. What a history of progressive, creative music during the late 60's/early 70's.The whole album is strong from start to end, but especially the final lengthy track ""Basking in the White of the Midnight Sun."" It's the kind of music that makes you remember, and admire the early works that haven't worn out there welcome in today's polished (which I enjoy also) world of not so ""real"" music.What a horrible loss Keith Relf's accidental death was/is. It would have been exciting to have had a couple more Armageddon albums!Buy This Music."
5,Excellent progressive/hard rock album.....,"Another example of a great group getting little to no air play. I really don't know why FM radio exists anymore. All they do is play the same stuff over and over. For young people today the current and recent music being pushed down their throat's is basically worthless and has little creativity and musicianship. Give a listen to this album if you want to have a glimpse of what musical creativity was like back in the 60's and 70's, the finest era for all of rock music. There were so many good groups back then and the music was phenomenal. This album is an outstanding example of great musicians and writing. These aren't songs they are compositions. It is just a shame this was their only album. Progessive/hard rock at it's finest!"
1,Made for small knees,These were way too small for our knees so I had to return them. I would list them as extra-small to small. They really wobble when they don't fit. The strap was a nice idea though.
2,little pad and not very comfortable,I don't think that there is anything like a comfortable kneepad. I don't like these. I thought the single strap will be more comfortable but no. These don't stay in place. I think a double strap model is much better. The pad are very little.
4,Unbelievable,"This book is well written and extremely interesting.It took me to places I'd never conceived of. That this poor young woman could write so well, after having suffered so much, is unbelievable."
2,Survivor Speaks out....Many remain silent,Unseen Unknown Unheard is a book that exposes the basic 'safe' horror the children had to live with. Sadly though it doesnt touch on the more serious forms of abuse these children and other children(away from 'uptop') had to endure. The book is the first attempt to speak out and be free from the horror of 'uptop'.
3,Silent Survivors,Silent Survivors need to speak out also. reading the other reviews makes me believe others haven't been heard through this book.
2,Last review is so right,I have read the last review about other children being exposed and abused by this cult and I agree 100% with the person who wrote it.I believe all the children suffered at the hands of a horrible group of adults that did not in any way deserve to escape jail sentences but if only people would investigate further the authorities may find the truth and facts this books only begins to reveal.
3,Good Value,"For the price, this fit the bill for my needs. I needed a outdoor drop box. This item is powdercoated black and has two doors the lid to cover the opening on top (keeps the rain out) and access door to get the contents. The keys are very simple though and the lock and access door can be easily bent or tampered with should someone want to mess with it. Easily mounts with two screws."
3,Fulton 15LW Locking Mailbox,Cheap mailbox. You get what you pay for. It is already starting to rust after a year and a half up.
2,Same ol' same ol',"Having read the previous book by this duo about biblical archeology I looked forward to a good and interesting read. I was hugely disappointed. There was nothing new in this book: it seemed to be a re-hash of some of the material in the earlier book. It may well be interesting to those who have not read the first book, but for me it was very tempting to put it down. (However, I did read it through to the end.)"
4,the most important question?,"For me the most important question is where did Hebrew Thought come from? Finkelstein seemed to recognize this question in The Bible Unearthed with an anemic response and no reference to it in David and Solomon. There are at least 8 principals that turn Eygpt on its head that one can derive from the early Bible - liberation, good vs evil (I prefer ""cruelty""), land, priests shall not touch the dead and not own any land, choose life rather than death, no infanticide, sabbath.Where did such ideas come from? What provoked them? Archaeologists have no clue.Gerson Jacobs (Marin county, CA)"
5,A great series,"This book, as well as the others in the ""Andrew Lost"" series, is wonderful! I stumbled across it as a gift for my nephew, but decided to read it to my 6 & 8 year old sons. They loved it, and we have read the whole series. Andrew's adventures kept the boys interested and there was a whole lot of learning too. Because Andrew is shrunk to a level we don't normally see, we get an ""up close"" look at things thru his adventures. There is lots of science, like what the color of a bubble means and how an insect sees with its many eyes (and so much more!). The books are sufficiently ""gross"" to interest boys, but not so gross that I couldn't read them. In fact, I learned at least as much as they did. Really interesting stuff! The chapters are short and easy to read. We finished each book in 2-3 sittings. I highly recommend these books."
3,Book club buzz,"The sentences were too short. Not enough detail. The book was too short.The sentences didn't have enough detail and it didn't paint a picture for the reader's minds.The sentences were to short as well as the book and not enough details.In my opinion, this book should be for the age range of 3-7yrs.The sentences were too short and didn't have enough detail.I didn't like it. Except for the cute puppy."
2,To be continued...,"I read this book with my kids. It was a fun story. However, the book ends with to be continued... I hated not having an ending to the story and I think my kids were disappointed too. I realize that it is meant to be a book series, but other books in a series still somewhat wrap up the book while continuing on with the storyline and characters. This book just leaves you hanging. I have no interest in reading the next book because it will most likely end the same way."
4,Overall Great Series,"My 6-year-old son loves these books and my 4-year-old daughter enjoys them, too. We finished the Magic Treehouse series and were looking for something similar that would mix fiction and adventure with true facts. To me, as an adult, these are not as well written as the Magic Treehouse books (a little more simplistic) but by son loves them just as much, which is what matters. We actually got the first four on audio to listen to in the car, and we listen to them over and over. We are reading the rest of the series and are up to number 11 now. At the end of each book is a ""True Stuff"" section with more facts about things that were mentioned in the story, and recommendations for other books and web sites to find more informaton. We are reading almost one of these books a day now."
4,Textbook in Disguise,"Jim Cobb has produced an engaging story of Georgia, half-memoir, that turns out to be a terrific textbook. Try it with high-schoolers, and just read it yourself. Nobody's intelligence is insulted, but even teens can enjoy this."
3,Hewitt's Medium is Not the Printed Word,"I expected of Don Hewitt's book something on par, at least professionally, with ""60 Minutes""; not so with ""Tell Me A Story."" This is an okay book-- always straight forward, occasionally telling, a few juicy tidbits-- it's just not a well-crafted, fascinating book. Don Hewitt is a masterful producer with a keen instinct for a good story. The medium of television is his, hands down. Hewitt is not a fine storyteller however. When Hewitt breaks into a sprint of passionate interest, the reader soon begins to realize that the excitement is all about Don, written by Don, and relived through Don's (perhaps) revisionist memory.In brief, if this were lying about at a church booksale, I'd recommend you snap it up at a tenth the price-- great beach or bath reading."
1,Not New,"I bought this book to give as a gift, so I picked a more expensive option because it said ""new"". I could have picked a copy that cost a dollar if I'd wanted a used version.The ""new"" book had a big black marker mark on the top of the pages. The corners of the dust jacket were all bent up. There was a big used book sticker on the back of the dust jacket covering the original barcode.This was not a ""new"" book as promised. I was unable to give it as a gift. Very disappointed."
3,A Decent Story; Not Great,"If this book attempts to tell a story, following Don Hewitt's philosophy for successful TV news segments, it's not the most engrossing one.This book reads like a timeline of Hewitt's life -- and then this happened ... and then this happened -- which doesn't allow for much drama-building. A pioneer of the TV news business certainly has a wealth of content for a book, but as is often the case with autobiographies, the story would have been better told by a veteran book writer.Some insights are valuable -- behind-the-scenes adcedotes about former President LBJ, his thoughts on the validity of the movie The Insider, his take on the 2000 Presidential election. But I found those nuggets to be too few and far between. The rest reads like a chat transcript.If you buy this book, I hope you do enjoy it."
5,Tell Me A Story,"Excellent book, so well written you can not put it down. What an incredible life this man had."
5,Tell Me A Story,"Great book by a great guy. From Murrow to pre-Couric, he was CBS News. 60 Minutes ia an ok show, too."
3,Interesting !,I am in Hewitt's business myself (in another part of the world). His book and his experiences give me a lot to think about.
5,Oh Too Cute,"I bought this and the ""Girls who shop"" tattoo's for my Cousin Bachelorette Party Favor Bags(shh- dont tell her). I gotta say, for $2- they are so worth it. The sheet is about the size of a 5X7, and the packaging is very Cute- almost chic. The pic on the web- really doesnt do them justice. These are going to go over really well with the party goers! Thanks"
3,Not as good as other series,I've been reading the Sookie and Harper series. This isn't bad but definitely not as good.
2,Disappointed,"I read all of Charlaine's Southern Vampire Mysteries so far with good results. However, when I jumped into this book Shakespeare's Landlord I felt let down tremendously.This book is about Lily Bard who's been through something traumatic. She's relocated and changed her life. She keeps to herself. She cleans home's and business. While out one night walking she see's something. Unsure of whether or not to report it for fear that it will bring up her past. She makes an anonymous call.I was at about page 56 when I was thinking, this chick is awful. She really dislikes everyone. Even people who are trying to be nice to her she's sort of abrupt and short with. It's common courtesy to be polite. Yet, Lily isn't. I get that she went through something before Shakespeare but come on. It just makes the story hard to swallow and not fun at all.I vote to skip this one next time. I do want to try one more but I almost feel like I'm putting myself through something I don't need to."
2,Not the same....,"I have read most of Charlene Harri's novels. But, I just couldn't come around and read this book. My favorites of course are the Sookie Stackhouse series and the Harper Connelly Series are excellent."
3,"Engaging heroine, flawed plot","Don't get me wrong: I liked Lily Bard. She's strong, private, has secrets, is self-disciplined and self reliant, keeps in good physical shape and can destroy a man with a quick karate chop. Besides, her house is obsessively neat and she brings that same sense of order to the other houses she cleans for people.And I like Charlaine Harris' view of small town America, with its tawdry secrets and perversions. The town of Shakespeare is populated with people I know, and Lily Bard and I chuckled at how seriously they take themselves and their small passions.But why would anyone want to kill the landlord? He was no better or worse than any of the rest of them, and his shadowy self is not finely enough drawn in this novel to provoke even the smallest curiousity about why he was mangled and his corpse elaborately hidden in the apartment complex. Lily Bard and the society she lives in are the reason I read the book with interest: the plot is superfluous at best"
1,Disappointed at the library,"I checked this out electronically from my local library and was frustrated and disappointed that the publisher restrictions require that I use a USB and cannot use Wireless download. I was a big fan of Charlaine Harris, but with her clout as an A list writer, it's inexcusable that she chooses to assume that her readers need that extra layer of security so that they won't steal her books.I was looking forward to reading this. But now, in order to read it I have to go through preparations that involve moving my computer from one room to another, digging up a DSL line so that my computer is directly attached to the network, then getting a separate USB line and hooking up my e-reader so that I can read it.I really wanted to read this book. I was pretty sure I was going to enjoy it. But I'll be danged if I'm going to support an author that for no good reason makes it difficult to read her books. So sorry. Done."
3,Eh!,"I am a huge fan of the Sookie Stackhouse books as well as the Harper Conelly series. I had a harder time getting sucked into the Lily Bard books, another Sookie series it is not, but I did enjoy how Charlaine Harris draws out the story. I can't say this is a book I will pass on but if you are a Harris fan it's worth the read."
3,Solid first book,"It took me a while to get into this but by the end of the book I liked Lily & was interested enough in the back story & characters to want to read the next book.Lily has trouble sleeping & one of the ways she tires herself is by walking the neighbourhood late at night. One night she sees something dumped using her trash cart, so she investigates. When she finds a body she makes an anonymous call to the local police. Through a series of events she gets pulled into investigating the case.The resolution is predictable, but not immediately and the journey taken to get there gives the reader more set-up, such as revealing Lily's demons, how she ended up in Shakespeare & why she wants to stay.If you like the Harris' Aurora Teagarden series you should probably give this a go too."
3,Lily Bard Myster,"This one wasn't too bad, but missing a lot of back story on the characters which would have filled out the story more. Not much detecting being done before the solution hits you in the face and no real lead up to the motive for the murder, like you jump from point A to point D, missing connection points B and C in between. I will probably read the next one to see how the main characters develop, i.e., see if she does any better than she did with Aurora Teagarden."
4,Very entertaining read!,Another of Ms. Harris's small town quiet heroines. Well written with a good pace; I liked it well enough to seek out the rest of the series.
3,Good and interesting,"I enjoyed this first book in the Lily Bard/Shakespeare series. The mystery is not one with too many twists and turns, but the characters, especially the protagonist, are nice to know. I have read each of the next four books and enjoyed each one a little bit more than the first."
3,Funny,Good quick readFor fans in CH this is great better than sookie Stackhouse books by far. Right up there with grave series
1,"Dark, dark, dark","I love Ms. Harris's Sookie Stackhouse and Harper Connelly series, but this one is awful. I only read the one book and didn't even finish it. The protagonist is a deeply damanged person and not someone I want to read about. I have heard that Ms. Harris decided not to write any more of this series after a few books. Good choice."
4,Awesome,I love the Sookie Stackhouse novels so I decided to give the Lily Baird novels a try. I think we are in for a fun ride with Lily and I can't wait to read the rest of the series.
4,Shakespeare's Landlord,"I love another character created by Charlaine Harris! I thought Sookie Stackhouse was complicated! Lily Bard has an even darker backstory! The author has given us enough of a glimpse into what happened to Lily to make her 'Lily', that you can't help but totally understand every odd choice that she makes!The author introduces you to all of the different characters in the small town of Shakespeare, that you feel as though you actually lived there and are going through small town living. Nothing slick here, just life going on in small town America. I love it!"
4,Lily's life is a little rougher than Aurora Teagarden's,"From the title, I expected an actual story about Shakespeare! But I was not disappointed. I've enjoyed all of Charlaine Harris's Aurora Teagarden mysteries (can't wait to see what happens next with roe & robin & the baby), so I figured I would enjoy this one by Ms. Harris. It's quite a bit different. Still authentically southern, but a little rougher with more graphic violence. Ms. Harris has a true voice for loneliness, need, regret, joy, vulnerability, perseverance and love. And, of course, doing the right thing. I wouldn't recommend it for young teens, but young and old adults will enjoy the twists and turns without getting too grossed out. I don't usually enjoy books with this sort of graphic violence, and these few passages did stay with me for a couple of weeks after I finished the book. But I've already ordered the 2nd one in the series, and I'm looking forward to the interesting characters and plot twists. Keep writing, Charlaine!"
2,Barely readable,"Sorry Charlaine, as much of a Sookie fan as I am (I have been with you since the beginning with that series) these books are... horrible. I ordered the first two and it was all I could do to keep reading and finish. After the first one, I was dismayed that I had already bought the second. Out of desperation (I had nothing else) I ended up reading the second book. BLECH!You are funny and so witty in your Sookie Stackhouse books. All of the characters are great... but these are just not good."
2,Not a Sookie Stackhouse or Conelly novel!,"I've read both the Sookie and Conelly series and love them, but Lily Bard was just plain boring to me. I'm a fast reader and it took almost a week to finish this book (which is so not me). I actually started reading and finished another book in between. It moved at a very slow pace, and characters just weren't that interesting. I probably won't buy the next book."
4,I like this author a lot...,"I like the works of author Charlaine Harris a lot and this book is no exception. I enjoyed this story. I thought the plot was interesting and intriguing. I liked the characters and the even-flowing dialogue. ""Shakespeare's Landlord"" is a story that most mystery lovers will appreciate."
3,It's an okay book,"I am a huge fan of Charlaine Harris, and have been immediatly captured by every book I've read thus far. This book however, is not on my favorites list. I liked the idea of the story, but it seemed to drag..for me. Because I am such a fan, I will continue through the series. I will let you know how they turn out"
4,An interesting start to the series.,Usually the mystery genre isn't really my thing but this book is an exception. The mystery itself wasn't really anything special but the heroine is the most interesting character I've come across in a long time. I can't really say anything more about her without giving too much away. Fans of Charlaine Harris' Southern Vampire series should give this series a try.
3,OK but not the quality of Sookie Stackhouse series,"I finished the Sookie series and thought I would try another Charlaine Harris series. Chose the Shakespear series and have just finished the first book. It definitely is not the quality of the Sookie books. The first book was OK but I will have to think about whether I want to get the second in the series. The story was, I am sorry to say, just boring. With the Sookie series, I could not wait for the next book."
2,What is wrong with this freaking game?!,"I can not believe this game continues to freeze up. My Xbox can play any other game I own perfect, but not Madden 07. The first game we got was returned within 2 days for crashing. So we played 06 for awhile...no problems. We got a brand new sealed 07 from the return and the game does the same FREAKING thing! Freeze up and crash the Xbox. Yet, all of my other games play fine. That pretty much narrows it down to this particular title having issues. There is nothing worse than sitting through 3 quarters of play and then *poof* game freezes up and your left cursing at your TV. Stupid.Ultimately, it isn't any different than 2006 except for some roster updates and a couple of new moves.Someone needs to issue a patch for this game that can be downloaded via Xbox Live to correct the problems with it."
4,This Game Rocks!!!!!,"This is the first time that I have owned a Madden football game. I can't compare it to the other games, but this one rocks! I love the highlight stick and hit stick.Pros: Good graphics, great commentary, and very funCons: If you challenge a play, it never gets reversed. It only gets reversed if the other team challenges.Notice I have only 1 con, so this game is a must get for Xbox!"
1,This game sux,Let me say that football games have been unplayable for about 3 years nowSo I tried to play this game to get back in the swing of thingsThe tackling in this game is unrealistic and the punting and field goal bar dont even get me started the graphics are just flat out garbage someone please bring back the 2k series you know a football game that actually gave people a challange and looked realistic.GARBAGE
3,Not as user friendly as '06,"I like it so far, and I think the new features are going to be cool once I get better at them. I just don't like that they made precision passing more complicated, and they changed the kicking, but I think I figured that out. I beat the computer by 52 points, so I guess I am doing okay (never mind that I was playing the Texans, ha ha). I haven't really used precision passing though...just gotten lucky on my passing for the most part. I liked that it did it for me in '06."
5,Greatest game of all time!!!!,"I love this game, I play it every day. I love all the features such as Franchise mode wich is simalair to seasen mode, it alows you to cut and trade players and hire free agents.The running controls are awesome they allow you to juke, spin, and truck through players. If you have a friend thats willing to play do rushing attack. Its a fast paced game where you play defense and offense each. If your looking for a gift our even for yourself buy Madden 07."
1,The frozen game,My wife purchased the game for my son and I and after playing this game for about two months it began freezing up during plays. We thought it was just the actual game that we got but after reading some of the reviews we see maybe it's just that version.
2,ice pack feom Amazon,"The back has a heavy white plastic which does not permit a comfortable fit for my neck. If the back portion was the same as the front, the product would be more beneficial."
4,Just OK,"I was unhappy with the quality of the outfit. My granson had his own light saber and just got is own mask, so all we really need was the cape. Lucky, because the rest of the outfit was cheap and not worth getting."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS VERSION!,"The original version of this film is an expansive epic of something like 3 hours and 40 minutes; this version gives you 100 minutes (1 hour and 40 minutes) so more of the film was cut out than left in! It shows too, in the resulting viewing experience. This version is choppy, doesn't make a lot of sense and makes the whole production look amateurish and completely miscast.The full version allows you to experience the life of Ernest Hemingway, whatever good or bad that may involve. He was a man who lived life hard and reflected it in his writings. In this edited version, you don't ever even see him writing! All the passion and emotion of the original is gone, and the power of Victor Garber's performance is totally lost.I would love to see Beverly Hills Video release the complete version of this film, and I would gladly pay more for it than what is being charged for this shadow of a film. C'mon, BHV, do the right thing and do it over!"
5,Helps avoid colds,We have been using Zand orgainic zinc lozenges for about a year. We start taking them as soon as we feel a little tickle or start feeling under the weather. I take as directed - every two hours. Often the cold never comes on. LOVE IT
4,Was initially just curious... but it saved my 10-gallon tank...,"I had not seen one of these for many, many years... but I thought it would be useful as an emergency filter for a small tank. I actually had a 10-gallon fry tank that suddenly cycled a few weeks later, so I added this to a spare airpump with a mesh bag of ""nitrate sponge"" and some nylon fiber and a filter pad... It helped stabilize the tank and save the fry. If you are someone who prepares for an emergency with your smaller fish tanks, this might be a useful purchase..."
4,Great product but fragile,"Great bubbles with triple-flow action, but I cracked it after a few uses and it will no longer hold charcoal. I would buy a new one though."
3,Filter,I got fast service it came in the mail when it said it would. My bowls started to look a lot better right away.
3,"Fragile, thin plastic. Cracks and breaks easily","I needed to replace my 25 year old corner filter when it got damaged during a move. This one is made of plastic so thin that the bottom cracked when I pushed the filter pedestal into the gravel. The ""grips"" that are positioned to hold the air stone tubing in place do not have a central opening large enough to accommodate the tubing. If you try to press the air tubing into the center of the riser tube the prongs will break off. As a consequence the air stone floats out of the riser and the filter is useless. The unit should be fitted with a rigid tube attached to the riser such that the air stone can be held in place.Other than the above mentioned quality and design problems, the filter functions as advertised and should be suitable for short term use until a better option becomes available."
2,Really depends on what you want it for...,"If you are looking for a cheap flimsy child's mask, this is a very wise investment; the helmet is actually shockingly well-done given that it is made out of chintzy lightweight plastic and the two pieces fit together with the help of velcro straps. While the thing might look good in the dark on Halloween, upon closer inspection it is very clearly a flimsy, cheaply made knockoff that has absolutely no business sporting a $30 price tag (though realistically with Lucasfilm's ridiculous royalties, this may well be the cheapest you can find!) Do yourself a favor and if you're looking for a decent sith lord helmet, be prepared to shell out at least $10-$20 more on amazon. Quality stuff might be available elsewhere for cheaper, but somehow I doubt it."
5,A MAGE-BORN'S MAGIC & HIS COLORFUL PARENTS KEEP U READING!,"Never a dull moment with these tales! A family of three unforgettable characters--a rough-and-tumble mercenary with a soft spot for his family (Conor), his spunky little healer wife (Eithne), and their unpredictable mageborn son (Rhoyd)--keep you glued to this chapbook. The three roam Keltora, ""Land of Magic and Myth,"" where they encounter bandits and bogies at every turn.This writer's smooth prose is laced with humor. By the time you finish reading, I'm betting you'll agree with me that the only thing wrong with THIS little book is that it ends!A perfect book for those subway rides to work or for a satisfying short story before bedtime! FIVE STARS!"
5,DVD! WHEN??,"This is an excellent movie! The history within is right on target and the love story is backed up by lots of eye witness accounts. There is speculation, yes, but then how could there not be?BUT WHEN IS THIS GOING TO BE OUT ON DVD??? So many lesser stories have been released! What is the hold up?? I want this, Amazon! Please do what you can to make this a reality!"
5,A Fine Story Needs to be on DVD,"I haven't seen this in awhile but wore out my VHS version through repeated viewings. With all the old third rate movies around, why is this still not on DVD? The history is as accurate as any movie's and the acting and human interest stories can stand comparison to many hollywood productions."
4,IKE (Robert Duvall ) ( VHS ),I like the movie but the only way it could be found was on VHS format. It was in very good condition. I would have said it was new but the seller said slightly used. This is not the first thing I bought through Amazon and will not be the last. I am very happy with everything Ive purchased.Thank you batcountrybooks and Amazon.
5,MUST READ for moms with preschoolers,"When you become a mom... you totally lose your identity as your new 'hats' take over. This devotional daily reminds you that your duties being a mom, taking care of a home, and being a wife, although challenging, are worth every moment. Cynthia Smith doesn't hold back while honestly and vulnerably sharing her own 'mom moments'. There've been days I've laughed right out loud and days I've cried as I related to her example. She has an amazing way of putting your frazzled days into perspective and reminding you that God is in control. Unlike any other devotional you'll read! Order one today!"
5,Very well done.,"Toss is a great teacher, very calm, articulate, and methodical. His ""bungie rig"" (visual teaching aid) is excellent, and demonstrates how the rigging works and that the mast and rigging are a system, not just separate wires to be tensioned. Step-by-step he takes the viewer through the tuning of of several rigs and explains not only what to do but what not to do to tune a rig. He demonstrates how to hear the wire tention, feel the wire tention, and to use mechanical guage's to measure the tention of a wire. The DVD covers a static(dockside,no load) and dynamic(on the water, loaded)tuning. The goal being to get the whole system working together to maximise, boat speed, performance, and safety. Very well done."
5,Making your boat go faster,This is a very good video on how to properly turn your rigging to maximize boat performance and safety. Presentor provides a detailed review of methods for proper rig tuning.
3,Savage Weekend,"I enjoyed the movie . It was fun, but I can't say much about the film transfer. Bad at best.It was watchable but not a great effort."
1,Buyer Beware!,"This DVD release of Savage Weekend is not the complete movie; it's a badly butchered, heavily censored version. Why? Who knows. But you don't want this. If you're looking for it because you're a fan of Caitlin O'Heaney, you especially don't want this."
1,ZZZZZZZZAVAGE WEEKEND,A group of dumb city slickers spend the weekend of HORRORS at a country house where a MANIAC in a FRIGHT mask eliminates them one by one via garroting-hanging-chainsawing-stabbing & hatpin to the head(I hates when that happens) The acting in this makes the actors from CANNIBAL FEROX look like Sir Laurence Olivier and has thee MOST visible boom mike in movie history. Waiting in line at the D.M.V. is more entertaining. Like to thankmy good friend Stan(runkdapunk) for he mentioned if I had SAVAGE STREETS(never even heard of it but will own) and looked through my DVD catalog and found this Gem(sheesh)
2,Well made Liberal Anti-war production,"Movie contains subtle anti war theme through out the entire entire production. Movie is well made with decent acting, but if you are looking for an action filled movie exhibiting acts of heroism by U.S. troops you will be disappointed. The primary focus of this movie is the negative physical/psycological challenges some returning troops face. My primary criticism is that a wide brush is used to paint all returning troops as head cases and does nothing to honor their sacrifice."
2,THE FUTILITY OF WAR!,"'Been There, Done That"" - Meets ""Coming Home"". This film's title was taken from a powerful war movie made approximately fifty years ago, same title stared Lloyd Bridges, Steve Brody, Frank Lovejoy, Jeff Corey, and introduced a fine young afro-american actor named James Edwards. However,this film is like some of the other movies trying to enlighten the public on the aftermath of war with little impact. America has a short memory; right now everyone is in ""Support The Troops"" mode. Just wait , once the conflict ends, let's see if the country has the same feelings about our brave young men and women who will need care and understanding. Believe me, I know (Vietnam vet with 3 tours under my belt). I strongly recommend viewing the original movie ""Home Of The Brave"" if it is available in vhs/dvd format."
5,great,"intense, moving, honest, practical-minded, in the ""Best Years of Our Lives"" tradition. Makes the majority of FX-laden Hollywood films irrelevant by comparison. A film about human beings, ourselves, Americans. Enjoyed immensely."
3,HomeOfDaBrav,"I really don't have much to say about the movie, bought it cause it was bluray and the price was right. I would say it was a so, so movie. It lacked in regards to the point it was trying to make in regards to veterans coming back and the issue's they face trying to deal with beingback home..."
4,Great.,"I haven't seen such interesting characters in a while. A solid 4-star; nothing more, nothing less. Samuel L Jackson is amazing as always, and as the movie went on, I slowly forgot Curtis Jackson was 50 cent. If all of the actors were in their 'zone' consistently through the movie, this would be a 5-star."
4,Deep!,"This film expands upon some soldiers who suffer lasting physical and/or emotional trama brought home from the conflict overseas, and the resounding impact it has on the people around them. This film was, at times, somewhat difficult to watch in parts, and some of the acting wasn't top of the line, but all in all the movie is definitely worth a watch, and shows a side of the conflict that people should be reminded of."
3,Not the Best....but still good!,"To Sam Graham's review.....bull....just because a war is not yet ""over"" does not mean that returning soldiers do not have the same problems as those returning from a war that is ""over""! While the movie deals with familiar material, I don't think it is worse just because it is current. The other movies that Sam mentioned in his review are great, but it does no harm to remind the viewing public that this ""war"" is just as bad, if not worse, in visiting horrors upon those who are unlucky enough to be chosen to participate in its execution. Sam, your review would be OK if not begun with a totally stupid remark!!"
3,Never Quite Flies,"The cover art is illusory - Home of the Brave looks like a war-in-the-desert film, but it is in fact about soldiers coming home and dealing with post traumatic stress disorder. Despite the strong cast, the film never really gels, and for such a potent subject, somehow the film falls short. Maybe it's because we're used to watching hyperkinetic action films like Blackhawk Down or The Kingdom, that Home of the Brave looks a little tame next to that. Irwin Winkler's direction and the maudlin soundtrack makes the film somewhat old fashioned - and as the film goes on, the subject matter seems to limp on and feels more like a TV movie. There isn't much else to say but don't get this if you are expecting an action film. It's not intense enough as a drama either. There isn't a shortage of Iraq war films out there so keep looking.PS - It's admirable to have a movie to showcase PTSD, but perhaps a documentary would serve that subject better."
5,Home of the Brave,This was a well made movie that hits home with everyone that has someone over there in the military...
4,Home of the Brave is a quality movie,"While it moves slowly at times, this movie portrays the feelings of soldiers who come home with more of an understanding of the reality of the Iraq war than people here at home. Most movie critics didn't rate the film very highly....but of course, they don't crtique the story, only the filming methods. Too bad; but, then most critics opinions are usually very far from those who actually view the films."
4,The Demons of War,"Accuracy of the combat scenses aside, this film hit me in the gut. Why? I have a son who is a vet from Iraq. He had been ""exploded"" several times, been in firefights and did things to others that no young man should ever have to do. He came home in one piece but with 40% disability. He won't talk about what he did. In watching this film I felt as if I was watching my son and trying to realize what demons come to him in the night. For those who think you can blow people apart and it not affect you, you are insane! WWII vets will still weep thinking of what they did.For me the film shows that those who are on the ""outside"" will have a hard time understanding and helping those that suffer. But the truth is that (and the film shows this) the person has to WANT to get help and deal with those issues.Great film. It will make you think."
2,Review,"When they lie on the back of the box in order to get people to watch your movie, no one should! That is exactly what was done. ""When a mission in Iraq is derailed by an explosive ambush, a small band of U.S. soldiers find themselves fighting for their lives."" That happened in the first 15 minutes of the film, and although if you want to argue philosophically that the rest of the movie also fits this description, I don't agree.Perhaps if the company was honest about the film and told the truth. That after leaving Iraq four soldiers go crazy and have to deal with their mental problems, leading to a doctor becoming an alcoholic who rips out his son's lip ring, another invades a business and holds a group of people hostage until he's shot dead, another who lost her right hand, dumps her old boyfriend because of her hand and finds a new one and the last one after smashing up a car re-enlists because all he can do is work at a movie theater.The acting was credible but the movie put me to sleep."
3,Movie not that great,The movie was not that great. The seller sent the movie on time and it was very fast getting the movie to me. My wife and I didn't like the movie as much as we thought we would. So not that great!
1,Curtis '50 Cent' of horrible acting!,"Who the heck ever told somebody that '50 Cent' can act? He is horrible. It is a damn shame that there are actors out there that can't get a break and this piece of wood is getting roles in major movies. He is horrible. Samuel L. Jackson is so overrated it isn't even funny. He gets so many roles and apparently turns down nothing. It isn't that he is that bad, it is just that he is not THAT good. Jessica Biel is good for one thing and that is to show off her body. She looks awful in this movie and she can't act so what is the point of even casting her. I know this movie was trying to make an important point but it just wasn't very good."
1,Was it all on purpose?,"I am a Field Artillery officer in the US Army. It's funny to watch films about the military and notice things that are wrong with the uniforms, weapons, radio chatter, etc; but it's usually small infractions and doesn't ruin the movie. I am fairly positive that the director went out of their way to make the most horribly incorrect film about the military, let alone Iraq, I have ever seen. Obviously having correct uniforms and whatnot is not necessary for the average audience, but it was more than just that, everything was just so wrong it caused me to laugh out loudly a few times. The plot was also as cliche and stereotypical as one could imagine. I'm actually getting mad writing this, just don't see it, it's possibly the worst movie ever made and I sort of want to point at the director and just laugh."
1,"Worst ""war"" movie ever.","This may be the worst war movie I have ever seen.How could Samuel L Jackson or Jessica Beil be part of this?I had to shut it off about half way through because I just wasn't buying it. Horrible acting, very predictable with every cliche in the book.Don't waste your time with this movie."
1,HOME OF HOLLYWOOD STINK !,This movie is a piece of junk what a waste of talent just not very good ugh ! Let's have too sanitary soldier's in Iraq in a war zone and just drop the F bomb in all coversation's phony baloney just not real people ! Bad fight scene's get hurt then call for chopper's that show up 2 second's later what a dog .........I never cared about any of the actors bad story with no story development of the characters...could have been good ....
1,A put down of the Army and of war,"I was disappointed in the movie plot and the role of one of the better actors (Samuel L Jackson). This movie obviously takes the side that all war is bad and that it creates unstable soldiers. Everyone in the movie has severe issues with dealing with life after combat. This is not the case with all of the marines and soldiers I know who have been through a lot in service of our country. The movie makes soldiers look like a bunch of whinny, problematic individuals, who are caught up in self pity. Samuel L Jackson should have passed this script by."
1,Very dissapointed :(,"I am very dissapointed with this product, The notation is fine and is all in the book, but Mr Juber, truly a business man! does not include the complete tunes in the cd, instead he tells you which cd you can buy to listen to it. So, not only you have to spend $25 on this, now you have to cough up the money to buy his cds as well. What he does in the included cd is to play bits of the songs slowed down in tempo, a lot of talking of obvious things if you pay attention to the notation, makes wide measure leaps and you wind up totally confused since even after hearing this ""master class explanation"" you won't have an idea of what the piece is supposed to sound like. I should have just played out of the powertab arrangements out there of the songs that I like and can be found on youtube. If I could have returned this book I would have done so."
2,Misleading product information,"The Amazon Editorial Review is incorrect and misleading. The included CD does not offer guidance on two of the fifteen arrangements. No instruction on either ""Strawberry Fields"" or ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps"" is given. Since those two pieces are the sole reason I bought the book, I am very disappointed."
3,"Tasty but ""All Natural"" does not = ""Plain""","Everyone is correct. They *are* pretty tasty--with a slight oniony flavor--but if you are just looking for _plain_ roasted almonds, these are definitely not it.Here's the ingredients list: Dry Roasted Almonds, Seasoning (maltodextrin, contains 2% or less of the following: salt, modified potato starch, sugar, monosodium glutamate, paprika, onion powder, autolyzed yeast extract, garlic powder, natural flavor, modified corn starch, corn syrup solids).Hope this helps!"
2,If you like onion flavor and can tolerate MSG,"I am addicted to Emerald's Cocoa Roasted Almonds. They're a delicious alternative to a candy bar with the same amount of calories as regular roasted almonds. Note: they are not sweet, so they are probably best for dark chocolate fans.I was delighted to find the plain Emerald Roasted Almonds for my husband who cannot have chocolate. We were both somewhat surprised to discover they tasted like onions. Yes, onion flavoring and paprika are in the ingredient list. I should have read the label before I bought them. I like these nuts, but they're not for the spouse who omits onions whenever possible.Note also: these nuts have MSG as an ingredient. If MSG gives you a headache, you might want to avoid them.Rebecca Kyle, September 2008"
4,The best almonds around!,"My husband purchased these almonds at Wal-mart and we immediately became addicted to them. You guessed it, Wal-mart quit carrying them. This has happened to us before on other products and we've just located a substitute. There is no sub for these almonds and, thankfully, Soooo good and a healthy snack to boot!!"
4,Delicious,"These dry roasted almonds are absolutely delicious and make a nice addition to any gift basket, christmas stocking or everyday lunch bag. However, this product will not meet the needs of someone looking for an ""All Natural"" product. The Amazon ad should be updated to exclude that sentence. If you're looking for a delicious, savory snack that's high in protien, but is a little different than run-of-the-mill almonds, you'll enjoy these."
5,a classic for food lovers,"This is a classic for the book shelf of every food lover. Great writing from one of the best. Makes you feel as if you ""were there."""
1,No help for Career Development,"I purchased this book hoping to find out about the opportunities available specifically in e-Commerce. This book, however, focuses on software programming/engineering in general. It is thin, elementary, and out-of-date."
3,SLOW,I am a Kellie Martin fan.the stories develop slowly but seeing Clarence williams III is enjoyable.But enjoyment can only go so far.The plots were juvenile and very easy to figure out. don't waste your money.Amazon has better films to choose from.
5,Good family fun,"I loved this and the other Mystery Woman movies when I first saw them on the Hallmark channel and was thrilled when I saw the dvd. My only disappointment is that Hallmark chose not to release all of the movies in this series. It is hard to find a good mystery movie that isn't full of sex, swearing and blood. This is one to can share with the whole family."
4,Mystery Woman movies are enjoyable,We have all the Mystery Woman movies and have enjoyed each. We would like to see more if they ever end up on DVD.
1,Disappointed,This product was uncomfortable and broke during its first week of use. Recommend the OEM version.
2,Unhappy,Phone is easily dislodged from cip when sitting. Already lost it once temporaily. It has very limited use.
1,Not so great,"Problem is that my phone falls out of this holster on a regular basis - once every two weeks or so. The retaining clip is not designed well, unlike my prior phone holster."
3,WAY BACK WHEN.,"This quaint odd-ball curio shows that a loving character can overcome prejudices regarding illegitamacy and genetic parentage. Based on the once-popular radio serial OTHER PEOPLE'S BUSINESS which starred Phillips Lord as Seth Parker, the story is cliched, the acting sometimes embarrasingly bad, while the singing is interminable. About the only time the film comes alive is in the buggy-chase toward the end - a nicely photographed sequence with some impressive stuntwork. A young Bette Davis (as Mary Lucy) is the love-interest of Frank Albertson. The story concerns a Maine preacher who manages to keep his foster son: it places very little emphasis on ""preaching"", but rather on common sense humanity of the ""little people"". As such, it has worth: as depiction of a cleric, the humanity, not the faith, is what shines through. Occasionally unintentionally hilarious."
2,Abridged,Although they claim that it has not been abridged I noticed some stuff had been edited out. I read the first edition four or five times before I lost it and can recall details that are missing from this edition.
4,"IT IS IN FRENCH, BUT GREAT JUST THE SAME","I've read bits and pieces of this book, and if you can read the French it is just as good as any English guide, with a litte more insight to the country (as it is written by FRENCH PEOPLE). If you're looking for a good English guidebook, try National Geographic Traveler or Eyewitness guides to France, as well as the Eyewitness guides to specific regions of France to get more in-depth advice on the best places to visit."
2,Michelin Red Guide to France fair at best,"Good basic information, but no english sub titles, overall I would not buy this book, all the basic information is on the web, in english, so we understand it...."
2,Not the best guide for the casual traveler,"First I need to get this out of the way....Yes, I knew this book was in French when I bought it. We were in France in November 2003 for 9 days, and brought this book with us on the reviews listed here. I must say, we rarely used it. The only time it came into good use is in smaller towns when we needed a good hotel. If you are a casual traveler, not looking to eat in 4 star French restaurants, this book is probably not worth the precious space in your luggage, or the $20. Definitely take the Green Guide with you anytime you travel in Europe. It contains the best historical and site information. Pass on the Red Guide, and follow your instincts (or the advice of the concierge) to find good food...and do internet research on hotels before you leave (the info from the red guide in online anyway at www.viamichelin.com)."
2,No English Sub Titles,With no English sub titles (The detailed explanation about the restaurants and hotels)you are better off using the FREE wes site viamichelin.com
1,There are better guides,There is a brief introduction in English and the rest of the guide is in French. caveat emptor
2,don't waste your money,All of the quotes from this book can be found the Brian's andreas qoutes website. I was looking for more and am disappointed I got dupped into paying for the same thing. Love his insight but this is a pointless purchase.
5,Warm and Fuzzy,"I saw this book in a boutique in Paducah, KY about 4 years ago. Flipping through a few pages, I needed no more convincing. I purchased the book, read it and placed it in our bookcase. Within the last four years, I have had two children and moved to a different town. I was unpacking some boxes the other day when I found this book. There I sat on the floor, reading through it. I couldn't stop until I was done. I logged on to find more of Brian Andreas's work. It is amazing. So simple, yet so touching. You have to read it!"
5,Super fun read!,"Laughed until I cried reading it in the store. Bought it then came home and ordered 10 more for gifts! The stories are so touching and delightful, they have just the right amount of humor to make the ""medicine go down""! Andreas is addictive."
4,a truly excellent debut!,"I read this book so long ago but just had to be the first to post a review...This is what essays are all about. It's a fun, informative, and smartly written jaunt through a culture and individual life.Wonderful!"
2,Clips lose the grip,"I had been pretty happy with the purchase until the clips became loose, which are not readily adjustable. The grip seems to be optimized the way it's shipped. Moving the parts either way makes it worse, or perhaps it's just me. Anyway, the adjustment is not apparent. Now it only works on jeans at the belt loops.Suggestions to the manufacturer:1. Improve the clips so that it's easy to tighten the grip.2. Add rubber pads to protect the fabric.3. I would've chosen the beige color if it's offered so the belts wouldn't show through a shirt."
2,almost 3 or 4 stars and would be 4 if for strictly work purposes,"These suspenders seem to be well made, with fairly heavy material and clips. They probably are good as work suspenders, where appearances aren't important. But, that's not what I bought them for. I bought them to wear on my normal jeans as everyday wear. The biggest problem with them is that, as noted in their descriptions, the straps are made of 2 different types of materials. The front straps are not elastic, but some other material and the rear straps are elastic. The colors of the 2 materials are significantly different. The front straps are a much brighter shade of red than the rear straps. I'd be much happier with them if all of the straps were the elastic material of the rear straps.If you're looking for strictly work suspenders, perhaps these would meet your needs as they are."
1,One size doesn't fit all,"If you're taller than about 6-ft, don't waste your money; these will not fit you. Only the lower back straps are elastic. The over-shoulder and front straps are not elastic and have absolutely no ""give."". Incidentally, the lower back straps and the over-shoulder front straps are ""generically"" navy blue but nowhere close to a color or fabric match. I chose to not waste time returning the item for a few dollars after shipping and instead gave them to charity."
2,"Looks cheap, had defects in leather","Bought and returned. Why returned? Looks cheap, had defects in leather, did not like the teeth system or the materials of construction. Would go with Dickies instead."
3,Not for larger people,"Nice style and well made but they didn't fit the person I bought them for. if you have a ""big belly......you need longer ones."
2,clips are too sharp,the quality is not bad but clips are too sharp and cut the jeans. It is not recommended to be used with regular pants and jeans ...
1,Short Changed,"Great looking, good fabrication but too short. I am 5' 8"" so was surprised to not be able close them. If they were too short for me -- how do you think they would fit on you? Don't buy them."
1,"Looks nice, performs bad","These suspenders have a nice design all except for one feature. They don't stretch. The front 2 straps are non-elastic, so they keep falling off your shoulders, and the rear 2 straps have no adjustability. I like to keep the 'X' up between my shoulder blades, but these one's stay towards your lower back, which makes them falling off your shoulders worse.I would say skip these and look for a pair that's made from elastic, and has an adjustable 'X'."
3,sudsdgo,"The suspenders are good quality.I should have looked closer at description, as only one side,the back, is flexible, I have never purchased suspenders before and thought the straps were flexible on both sides."
3,Adjustment Struggle,"Good quality suspenders however the adjustment of the straps is very tedious. After a half hour struggling with it, I finally moved the strap, with some force, however it just slipped out of its ring. Trying to insert it back into the ring was even worse of a struggle."
3,WEAR THEM EVERYWHERE,"The price of these Red Rooster suspenders was reasonable. I loved them so much I wear them everywhere I go, weather its the Olive Garden or Jim's catfish shack, Walmart or a doctors office. Let me tell I really stand out as the only man wearing suspenders and bright red at that. One drawback I've noticed, sometimes they catch hold of projections."
5,Very Satisfied,We searched everywhere in our town for this type of suspenders. We couldn't find them so went in on the Internet. My husband is very happy and satisfied with these suspenders that we ordered.Thank You
1,Not worth it,The tattoos don't stay on as long as they 'claim' they do. Plus applying them to your skin takes longer than what it says on the directions.
5,Fairytale,One of my favorite movies ever. A 21 st century fairytale. The scenery is beautiful and the acting is wonderful.A must see!
4,great movie,loved the movie I had to own a copy after renting it.It's definitely a keeper. Johnny Depp is yummystreaming was perfect
4,Good movie,I like this movie. I think it is entertaining. I wanted to have this movie in dvd and add it to my collection.
5,WINX!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I got this toy 3 months ago and nothing has broken so far. My 5 yr old brother has no interest and I am excellent at keeping things in good condition. I play with it loads and I havn't had any troubles. I still know where all the items are, even Bloom's tiny cute bunny Kiko! I also have all the normal winx dolls, so I have two Kiko's. There is one problem though, Icy gets stuck in the Magic Door and it's difficult to get her out. I've also bought the magiclal minis and I make them change into fairy by using the magic door.$$$$$$$$$$MUSA$$$$$$$$$$"
4,Lot's of teeny tiny little pieces!!!!!!!!,"Many small, fragile pieces to loose. Each doll has tiny arms & legs which come off very easy. My children are old enough not to put these parts in their mouth, so not a choking issue for us, but those w/toddlers beware! Despite this, they really enjoy playing with the set."
5,Anything Winx will be BIG for Christmas 2004!!!,"Barbie is going to have a run for her money if you ask me. The dolls for Winx Club are georgous and my 5 y.o. adores them. She's never carried around her Barbies like she does her Winx. We don't have this product YET, but I'm sure she'll get it for Christmas! Check out Winx dolls, Winx Club show on Fox (Sat.a.m. in our area) (...). I can't emphasize enough how BIG the Winx Club is going to be!!!"
2,Not Worth the $$$$$$$,I bought this for my 4 1/2 year old daughter. She plays with it and seems to enjoy the castle but the arms & legs on the dolls continuously fall off! It is cheaply made.
2,Great idea- terribly made,Great idea and the castle is great- but the dolls are horrible. Arms and hair fall off every two minutes. Wish they would replace them with working dolls. Not worth the money since my daughter will only use winx dolls with the castle and they keep falling apart.
4,ALFEA PLAY SET,THIS TOY IS GREAT VALUE. YOU GET 5 DOLLS AND THE ALFEA COLLEGETHAT OPENS AND LIGHTS UP. IT ALSO PLAYS THE WINX THEME SONG WHEN YOU MOVE CERTAIN PARTS OF THE PLAYSET. MY GIRLS LOVE THIS SET. THE PLAYSET IS NOT TOO BIG OR TOO SMALL. OUR FAMILY WAS VERY PLEASED WITH THIS TOY.
4,FUN BUT FIX THE ARMS PLEASE,My daughters received this as a gift and haven't stopped playing with it since we opened it. My only problem with this toy is the little dolls......the hands fall off constantly which could be annoying if your kids are on the young side. Every few minutes they come to me to re-attach an arm or leg. My oldest is 5! (Obviously if your child is still putting toys in there mouth-this is not for you). If they could make the dolls a lot better this would be an amazing toy for the kiddies.
2,poor quality,"I bought the playset in early Sept. 2005. My 2 girls love to play with it, but I am snapping the arms back into place constantly. I am very disappointed with the quality. It is also a choking hazard for youngsters!"
1,Winx Club Alfea College,"I don't recommend anyone getting this product!! Within 5 minutes of having it, two of the dolls arms came off!! I thought this was terribly made and a waste of money"
3,Replacement Figures,A full set of replacement figures is availbe from Mattel for $8. I assume they may have the same problems with breakage. This playset would be rated much higher if this were not an issue.
3,Annie meets opera,"This is the warbliest rendition of Annie I have ever heard. Personally I am not a fan of super-hyper vibratos or fluttery voices, and it seems every voice on this album can be described this way. I much prefer the original Broadway and 1982 movie versions...I like ""Annie"" to have a big belty voice like the original Andrea McArdle. Also, it sounds as if ""Hard Knock Life"" was pitched a little too high for the orphan chorus. However, if you are a rabid Annie fan, this should definitely be in your collection! But overall I found it to be just ""okay""."
1,Bad Spanish,"I have not read this book, but the front page says it all: the spanish is already incorrect. Why? The correct translation should read ""La cocina comercial en espanol e ingles"" not ""la cocina de comercial en espanol y ingles.If they took this little care with the front cover of their book I can only imagine how many errors the rest of book will contain."
1,not a great buy,"Even at the used price of $15. Only Two episodes.It will take forever to get all the episodes, if they don't quit midstream that is and quote 'lacking sales' thus you get only partial bits of the collection. ( see The Nanny - they still haven't released season 4 after 10 years).278 episodes total in the collection. That would roughly be $4,170. not including shipping.I don' think so."
1,Dead on arrival,"The screen goes dark after one second of displaying the screen content. If I cycle power, then the screen turns on for one second, then goes dark. This is a piece of junk. The back light is going kaput on the first day of operation!"
2,Backlight lamp gone after 14 months. Common problem(?).,Pros:Good monitor. We have three of them.Cons:Short life. Expensive repair. I'm nervous about the other two now.
5,HP w1907 monitor,"Well packaged and delivered on time . PNP unit , connected , adjusted resolution and hit auto set , works like a charm . Does need a speaker upgrade and just throw out the install c.d. It causes error codes which nobody can figure out what they are. Comes with all necessary cables. Looks good and works good."
4,"Best 19"" Monitor for the Money","I looked at several monitors in the $100 - $125 price range and the HP 1907 stood out from the bunch. I don't like the anti-glare coating that Acer puts on all of their monitors. It makes the screen dull and less sharp. The HP monitor has a crystal clear display that renders a beautiful, sharp image. The HP monitor was on sale for $110 at Office Max which seemed like a really good deal. About the only downside with this particular monitor is the 1 year warranty. Almost all other monitors have a 3 year warranty. This was almost a deal breaker but the image quality won me over."
4,nice monitor,monitor came in on time and in good condition...screen is bright and clear. It works well as a second monitor (dual monitor set up) with my HP lap op...
3,Color Fringing,"Bought separately this HP monitor and HP computer (Vista). Digital cable.Color fringing (colored halos around letters) with native resolution. Could be due to the fact that the monitor uses MS driver, not HP driver. Was unable to update to HP driver from Device Manager (access denied). Tried to uninstall monitor in Device Manager.Sound is not very good, as expected. Just use separate speakers."
1,a clunker at 3 years old,"This monitor came with my computer and just turned 3 years old this month.For about 6 weeks I have notice a sutble flickering, then occasionally, andmore often recently, the screen goes black. I have to turn the monitor off, thenon to get the picture back. The bottom line from the sages on the internet is that thepower something or other is going and will soon be kaput; meaning I will have tobuy another monitor. The concensus is that LCDs of some brands are more prone to this thanothers.Thus, I will not be buying another HP monitor."
5,Outstanding value! AND it is HP!,"I just ordered this monitor and it arrived in a day and a half! WOW! Lol, good service!Easy to set up. Excellent, crispy picture. The ONLY downside is not being able to adjust the highth as it is a hinge connection on the back with a base plate to attach, it can still swivel its face up and down, just not lift up any. No big deal as my computer armoire sits high anyway.For the money it is the best deal I have seen in a long time, especially being an HP product"
1,Stops working just after warranty expires,"This was a nice enough monitor for the first year. At about 13 months, the screen started going blank after about being on for just 3 seconds.After researching this on the web, I learned that many others have had this issue and it almost always occurs about 13 months after purchase which is just past the warranty period! DO NOT BUY. It's really painful to toss out what still feels like a ""new"" monitor. I will never buy HP again."
3,Annoyingly middle road,"Short and sweet: The display is fine. I have mine running at the native resolution of 1440x900. Things come through crisp and clean.The problem? The damn thing keeps auto-adjusting at the -worst- possible times. In the last 10 minutes, I've counted it doing this 12 times. It gets old, really fast."
4,Nice looking,"I'm not a monitor expert so I was looking 2 things before I bought this product: looks and energy savings, and I get more that I wanted, it is great looking althought the buttons should be at the side of the screen and not at the bottom, but for a guy that was upgrading from an old 15"" Compaq CRT monitor found the W1907 is like heaven. The sound quality of the integrated speakers is good for an office PC but is null for a home-entertainment use in my opinion."
1,Great for single input users,"Very nice and crisp looking monitor for a great price; it's a shame they screwed up the monitor switching capability so royally. When switching from DVI to VGA or vice-versa, the monitor will display the new source for half a second then go blank. The only way to get the monitor to display the new source correctly is to go through the on-screen menus, set the new source as the default, and then turn it off and turn it back on about 10 times. Switching back requires the same procedure. This monitor is great if you only have one source hooked up to it; if you have two, it's worthless."
1,Not worth the risk,"My HP1907, like so many others went to sleep one day and never woke up. 13 1/2 months after purchase. The HP support people were no help unless I paid them $99.00 to begin with. Their website is full of complaints of the same nature and HP will not even acknowledge the problem exists. And for most of the people with the same situation, the monitor lasted a little over a year, just out of the warranty period. If you get a good monitor, it's great, but you could be buying a temporary product and not a long term investment."
1,worth ZERO stars,I have an HP desk top and purchased this so I would not have compatibility issues.The monitor keeps going to sleep and the HP help site is worthless. I have to manually change the resolution settings every time I turn my HP desktop on. To make it worse if my computer is not used for a while or I switch users I have to reset the resolution again. I use my computer for a living so this is not a toy for me it is my livelihood.I probably will never buy HP again. I am not sure why HP did not offer a fix for this since I have researched this issue and so many HP customers have had this problem. This is another example of a large corporation not giving a crap about their products or their customers.
1,Are you kidding?!,"Ok, so I bought the Video Now for my 3 1/2 year old and she treated it like gold, literally. She was so careful with it and it was easy to use, but the quality was terrible. After using it for 1 month, I had to keep changing the batteries after a 10 minute car ride to school. Brand new batteries wouldn't last more than 10 minutes, no joke. I contacted the manufacturer and they offered to send me a new one if I send back the old one. While Hasbro was wonderful about replacing the Video Now player, the replacement was not as wonderful. The replacement player would work fine for about 1 minute; after that, the picture starts to jump and you hear tons of static. I paid full price for this last christmas and it is a joke. I ended up buying an inexpensive portable DVD player and it's worth every penny. No wonder the price has dropped on the Video now players and I see many stores placing it in the clearance bins! NOT WORTH THE MONEY!!!!"
2,"COMPLETE, AND UTTER WASTE OF MONEY.!!!! DONT B FOOLED!","If I could give this toy a ZERO MINUS on durability, I would. I have a 2 year old daughter for whom I bought this toy. My daughter watched it all of 20 min before she sat it on the living room table and permanent lines began to come across the screen. We took the batteries out and put them back in...same thing. Are they kidding me when they say this toy is durable for preschoolers!!! Blow your breath on the damn thing and it will skip...(see other reviews). The sound quality sucks, and really the picture isn't the best either (but both are suitable for a toddler). Apparently these toys are defective seeing how the problem appears to be across the board. No wonder this thing is no longer being sold in stores. Buy one you'll see for yourself."
3,The fun doesn't last long,The life of the batteries in this toy is about 4 to 5 hours of playing time. Once the kids watch a few videos the batteries need to be replaced immediately. Make sure you stock up on batteries because this device requires several at a time and you will be replacing them several times a week.Also after two months of using it... the screen completely went out on this device...it now only plays the sound with no video.
2,GOOD IDEA. BAD CONCEPT,"I brought this toy thinking a portable DVD for kids, Great! Now I can enjoy my t.v without being interruppted by the Wiggles. But to my suprise the toy was very durable but what child will sit still to watch it. It skips like crazy. All that this toy needs to be perfect is a charger and ANTI-SKIP. Who forgot ANTI-SKIP? Was they trying to be funny? It is a kids toy from ages 3 and up. Who's has a child from the ages 3 and up that sits still?"
3,Where's the charger?,"Don't advertise the charger for this because the VIDEONOW may be able to use it but the JR does not. Having said that put some stock in Duracell or Energizer because you'll be changing the 3 AA batteries about once or twice a week. I do like that we can travel with it and it keeps my 3 year old occupied but I was a little disappointed with the video's. They are only about 20 minutes long each, and where is Elmo's World?"
1,Low quality! Sounds scratchy and picture gets scrambled!,"We bought this for our almost 3 year old son for Christmas. He absolutely loves it, when it works that is! About 10-15 minutes into watching it, the sound goes scratchy and the picture scrambles and eventually stops. When I called Hasbro, they suggested totally removing the batteries and reinstalling them. I tried that, and it didn't work. According to other parent reviews, lots of people are having the same problem. We are going to exchange ours for a new one to see if maybe there is just a bad batch of them out there. If the new one still doesn't work, we will have one disappointed little boy."
5,MY 1YR OLDS FAVORITE CHRISTMAS GIFT,My mother in law bought this for my 1 1/2 year old for christmas. It is the best toy. My other two children have games to play in the car so he had to have something to. We take it everywere. He's dropped it outside in the driveway & out of a shopping cart and it has survived it all. The only thing that happens is it turns off if you drop it to hard but it never hurts the way machine and the disc never falls out. They built it so that little ones can't open it and the volume control is hidden so any time I want to turn it down I just make sure he doesn't see me. He does tend to push the off button on himself quit a bit but I let him do it and now he's learned not to push it if he's not done and he's also learned how to turn it on for himself. The regular Video Now discs work as well. It's well worth the money.
3,GREAT IDEA...NEEDS A LITTLE WORK!!,"I purchased the Video Now Jr. for my daughter for Christmas, and she loved it!!! It was easy for her to use with the big chunky buttons and we bought discs with all her favorite shows. It was perfect for the long car rides we have everyday (think about purchasing headphones!) The only complaint that I have is that it eats through batteries like crazy!! From Christmas to New Year's we replaced the batteries THREE TIMES! Just so you know, THE CAR ADAPTER IS NOT FOR THE VIDEO NOW JR.!!!! [...]All her Jr. Discs play on the regular Video Now so we didn't lose any money. My daughter doesn't even notice a difference, but loves her new ""purse"". Overall, this toy is great! But save your money and get a regular Video Now Color!"
3,fun but not durable,"I brought the VideoNow Jr. player for my 3yr old son as a XMAS present. I love the picture and the way it keep his attention. After opening and viewing Dora the Exployer video, the player stopped only after 45mins. I changed out the already new batteries and replaced it with a new movie and still nothing. I sent it back for a replacement. They no longer have it avialble on Amazon.com, so I had to get a refund. I will buy another one. Hopefully this was just a defective player."
5,Wonderfully Refreshing For On-The-Go-Parents,"I purchased this toy for my daughter, because we frequently make car trips out of town. She seemed to very bored of reading books and coloring and always asking that time old question"" Are we there yet?"" This player solves all of these problems. She gets to watch her favorite shows, and doesn't even pay attention to the fact we are on the road. I love it !"
3,"Good idea, bad results","Okay, based on good reviews I bought this toy for my daughters birthday along with three videos. She LOVES Nick Jr. and I loved the ruggedness and the portablilty. We have a portable DVD player, but I wanted something she could hold and not break. The problem is it sounds scratchy a lot! The screen gets fuzzy and makes a hissing sort of noise. I tried changing the batteries like it suggested figuring maybe it just ate them up quickly--but new batteries did not solve the problem. We have had this 5 days and after hearing my daughter say ""mommy fix it"" over and over again, this toy will go back to ToysRus this weekend. What a disappointment."
4,one of the best things we ever bought,"We purchased the video now JR for my 3 year old son. We make a lot of 2 hr trips to family, so figured this would be good for in the car. The screen is small, but good quality. The battery life is pretty good. It seems to last at least 20 hours on 3 AA batteries (closer to 10 hrs when using rechargeables).the one major negative about this player is the fact that the discs it plays are proprietary. You cannot play regular DVDs on this, nor can you play the discs on a DVD player. They do not cost that much, however and the episodes available are pretty good. My son has over 15 discs and he watches it even at home."
1,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED !!!!!,"I bought this toy based on the reviews and I am not to happy with this toy at all. My daughter loves it but I think that Video Now Jr makers should have a little more consideration on the parents when making this toys, since we are the ones that are going to pay for it. VIDEO NOW JR. DO NOT HAVE AN OUTLET FOR AN AC ADAPTER LIKE THE REGULAR VIDEO NOWs DO!!!! PARENTS PLEASE BE ADVISED YOU REALLY NEED TO STOCK UP ON BATTERIES IF YOU ARE GOING TO BUY THIS ITEM. The batteries drain VERY!!!!! Fast. My daughters Video Now Jr. will be on ebay in a day or two if I cannot find the reciept to take it back to the store."
2,"Good Concept, Bad Product","We bought two of these for our toddlers (2 1/2 and 4 years old). I was very disappointed at the picture quality and how quickly it uses the batteries. Both of them required new batteries after only a couple of hours of viewing. I would not recommend this for toddlers. Older children may have more patience with the picture skipping, etc. Good Luck!"
1,Battery Eating Machine,"We bought two video now Colors, and a video Now Jr. for our kids, thinking it would be fun for the car. However with standard alkaline batteries not one of them lasts for more than 5 minutes. I spent money on the more expensive (M3) batteries, and they seem to last longer. However at $9 a pack that seems a bit pricey, even the rechargables don't hold up well in the player."
2,Acceptable for pre-schoolers. Consider a Portable DVD player.,"This product is acceptable for preschoolers and younger childeren and can withstand whatever they throw at it. If your child is 4 or older, and listens reasonibly well to directions, I would reconsider this purchase and consider getting a portable DVD player. The limited variety of discs available for this player and their increased cost make this item not as attractive an option as a portable DVD player. Also, if your children are fans of Disney Channel, none of their favorite shows are available in this playing format. My daughter enjoyed watching shows she typically doesn't see, but, with the exception of Clifford, the shows were not entertaining after seeing them 5 times. Most of the shows are ideal for 30 minute drives, so keeping a few on hand (in the case is ideal) is preferrable."
5,espejos del alma,this brought back so many memories. I lost this cd about 15 years ago and am so happy to have been able to find it again. thank you amazon.
5,Country Quick and EAsy cookbook,"I love this Country cooking cookbook, the recipes are so fast and simple and dont' use tons of ingrediants, it is usually stuff you keep around your house and their is a honey porkchop recipe that is one of my husband and mine favorites. All the gooseberry cookbooks are fantastic, i have a lot of them. If you like to cook you will love these books. I think you would like them even if you dont' like to cook because they are easy to follow directions. I have a collection of them and always look forward to new ones coming out."
3,Tony Remy Rocks!!!!!!!,"Once again Tony Remy proves that he's one of the finest guitarists, writers and producers on the planet. So why only 3 Stars I hear you ask. Well, he does only share this project, and I can't understand what Bluey does here other than interfere with what could have been a great project. So the stars are for Tony Remy. Wicked!!!!"
5,Clint Black Spend My Time,"This DVD is one of Clint's best, I love it, my favourite song is Just like you & me, first time I heard it was at a Funeral & it was so beautiful, never get sick of hearing it, words are amazing."
4,KregKMS7723,This is a very handy tape. I am using it on a Miter Saw stand that I made so that I can measure the wood to the exact length from the blade and cut it off. The tape is attached to a brace and I use a stop block with a plastic window that shows the distance from the blade to where I cut it off. It works great.
1,Defective,"These Kreg tapes suffer from the same problems as 2 other tapes I have purchased from different companies. They are not accurate or precise. The inch markings vary in size (either too large or too small) by up to 1/32"" resulting in measurements that can be off by up 1/16"" if several inch variations combine. To make matters worse the sizes vary so that the measurements drift in and out. For example over a 12"" span each measurement may be too large, or too small or right on making these absolutely useless for measurement. All the tapes I have purchased from different companies have this problem. They all have been manufactured in China where apparently the quality control is terrible.Save yourself some aggravation and don't buy these. I'm still looking for a self-adhesive measuring tape that is accurate and precise.Ultimately, I was able to buy adhesive tape measures from Oregon Rule Co. [..] that are accurate and precise."
4,GREAT AS A GROWTH CHART,"We have been marking our kids heights in our closet on the wall for the last 4 1/2 years. When the boys would ask how tall they were I would have to run and find a tape measure to measure from the floor to their mark on the wall. I wanted to find a chart but I only found cutesy baby type ones that went to about 4 feet. My 13 year old son still likes to be measured so I was not finding what I needed. Then I wondered if anyone sold a tape measure with an adhesive backing and SURE ENOUGH they do. Then the hardest decision was what width? Right or Left? ha ha Anyway, it is now stuck to our closet wall and the boys can check their own height any time they choose. I even have my mark up there to prove to them and myself that I am STILL 5'8""."
3,Description not obvious about it reading right to left,"When I opened this, I was shocked to find that it reads right to left, otherwise you would have to mount it upside down. I went back to the listing to see if I missed that detail - it's buried down deep in the product information and not at all obvious!"
1,"Buen Reloj, pero pagué el doble por el hace 2 años.","Compré este reloj en el 2008, en aquel tiempo me costó 400 dólares, o sea el doble de lo que cuesta hoy. Es un buen reloj pero pagué definitivamente más de lo que vale, tengan cuidado con esta marca pues sus precios son engañosos."
3,Just OK,"I will never buy another watch again unless I can touch it and feel it. The watch is just not handsome and my Colleagues at work think it is almost comical 'very mickey mouse'. It seems to work OK though, even though it gains at least a minute each week. I just realized yesterday that both knobs on the side of the watch near the winder were missing! I found one between the keys on my computer keyboard, god knows where the other one is!I thought of buying an Invicta but decided on this one, I will not be buying another."
4,Was excited to get,"I was very excited to get this book(s). I didn't think I could ever afford it. The cheapest I had seen up to this point was $165.00 which certainly was not in my budget. I'm not too happy about the cover, it's just heavier paper, but, I have the book."
1,Halloween,"I purchased this as part of a Halloween costume that I used for a Halloween party. The glove was not comfortable to use, nor was it constructed nicely. I wish I would have read the reviews before I bought it."
3,Wish was option for 10yr old size.,"Son was Freddy Krueger for Halloween which is a 10 yr old, had to use regular stretch gloves under claw glove, fingers didnt reach underneath to the top of the claw. But is worked and your able to put fake blood on them, sticks. Good for a 10 yr old due to the safeness of the actual claws being plastic that bends easily. If purchased for child over 10, should fit fine but use some thin gloves underneth. Stayed on Halloween night due to gloves underneath and using tape around wrist to have the claws to stay on."
5,Fit my 8 yr old son well,"I was hesitant to buy this because it says it's one size fit all (for kids and adults) and looks huge! But my 8 yr old son just had to be Freddy for halloween (hasn't seen the movie) and what's Freddy without his claws? We received this today and to my surprise it fits my son well. There are 2 holes on the underside of each finger so that smaller hands can fit through and not have a bunch of bulk material. Also, there are straps under the fingers that you can fasten to make it tighter around smaller fingers. And, as the picture shows, there is a string to tighten the glove around the wrist. My son is outside playing with it right now and having a blast and it's not falling off or coming loose at all!"
1,her WORST move!,"Wow, this is the SADDEST excuse for a movie! Slow running, and so far out there that I think the director was Puffing the magic dragon as he sat in his chair! Do yourself a favor, if this is all there is to rent in the video store, go home and get rest, as that would be a better way to spend your time!"
5,Great Family Fare!,"This is a FAMILY movie. If you want ""edgy"", this movie is not for you. But it's a wholesome story, well told, and, while the turf is familiar, the characters have surprising depth and the plot manages to avoid most cliches.If your kids like soccer, this film definitely will appeal to them."
2,Not As Good As I Thought,"Good But BoringGood Reason:I Liked The Wy The Girl In The Story Had A Lot Of Potential About How She Wanted To Play Football And Continue To Play Instead Of Doing What Her Mam Wants Her To Do.Boring Reason:It Was About One Storyline ""Football""It Was A Good Film But Just A Bit Boring"
4,A nice introduction to the tongan arts,"It is a good book for amateurs, with very nice photos. Not very analytic though, which I think is the only desadvantage. The texts are sometimes short. Sorry for my english"
5,"P'town: Art, Sex + Money on the Outer Cape","If you want to know anything intimate about the folkswho dwell and stand out in Provincetown, you must read thisbook.Not only informative, but totally exciting and it wouldinterest anyone in its close details of the lives of thepeople there. In fact, most of their names, telelphonenumbers and addresses are in the Cape Cod telephone books:Orleans and Hyannis.Norman Mailer, Jay Critchley and others are discussed, also a famous murder, Christa Worthington, and more.Traveling to P'Town and Cape Cod is a bit expensive, comingfrom Central MA where I live, but if I could, I'd be happyas a writer to travel there often to interview some of thewell known people there."
1,Ugly and stupid,"This is a sloppy, lazy, badly written piece of work whose only purpose is to argue that Provincetown has been ruined by those awful homosexuals. Manso tries to cover himself with stories about Jay Critchley, but the real driving force of the book is his hatred of gay people. If you hate homosexuals, especially those with money, you might enjoy this book. Otherwise, I suggest that you skip it."
2,Horribly written,"Yuck! I have a house in Ptown and thought some of the stories were interesting, however, the writing is terrible - as if a string of articles was strewn together to form a book. It does not portray gays in a positive light, but it also pokes at virtually every other ""group"" of people. Don't bother reading this."
3,Misleading classification,"The search subjects for this book bill it as ""secondary"" and ""high school"" language arts. After receiving the book, I can see that it is very much for elementary level teachers. All the pictures, examples, and suggested resources are elementary level.The book does look like an excellent resource for elementary teachers."
2,LAN Times is a good book for Novices to SQL,"I was introducted to this book as a student at DeVry Institute of Technology in Dallas, TX. I found the book to be a great introduction into the SQL language. The books presents a detailed (yet non-exhaustive) history of the language, along with a good solid introduction to the methodology of SQL. It also provides practical examples of relational DMBS scripting, history and methodology. I would recommend those with absolutely no database experience check out the Modern Database Management book (ISBN: 0-8053-6054-9) before purchasing this book."
5,A GREAT CHOICE FOR YOGIS OR NOVICES,"This book is one of the most accesible yoga books I have read. Sometimes yoga books can be more daunting than a class itself! The prose is often very esoteric and the poses intimidating. Gurmukh makes the esoteric understandable. The book makes sense of the chakra system for western readers. The poses are attainable, no foot behind the head! I've been Ashtanga for about three years and this book really makes want to try Kundalini."
5,Different from other yoga books.,"I am currently really interested in yoga, and have been reading several books on the subject. I bought this one because I was pregnant last year, and used the pre-natal video by the author. I was not disappointed with the video, and I found the book to be a great way to learn more about the author, and most especially her style of ""Kundalini"" yoga. Kundalini yoga focuses more on the breath, chanting, and mantras than your traditional yogas. The book focuses on the 8 chakras (hence the title of the book), and how you can work to ""unblock"" them and/or get them to work to their fullest extent. Sounds hokey, I know, but you get into it, and she does have some good points. There must be something to her practice, because all the celebrities don't go to her for nothing!!! (They include Madonna, Cindy Crawford, David Duchovny, Courtney Love, etc.)"
5,Enhances Well-being on Every Level,"I have spent hundreds of hours doing yoga, chigong and related disciplines, but nothing relieved the constant shoulder and neck tension caused by endless hours of deskwork. However,within just a few days of practicing the ""simple"" exercises in this amazing little book, I was pain-free for the first time in years. Just that fact alone lifted my spirits tremendously. I have no idea why such a simple routine of exercises is so enjoyable and beneficial, but I highly recommend this low-key and loving book for anyone who needs a lift. My deepest thanks to the author."
5,Nice book,This book i wanted since long and finally I got from Amazon.The contents of the book are appealing and will render tremendous benefit to those who take real benefit of this book by practicing Yoga.
5,Interesting even if you're not taking a Philosophy class!,This book really makes you think about what you believe and what reality really is. It challenges your way of thinking on so many levels. It helps you learn to argue a point or realize a point you believed can't be true or that you don't have the evidence to determine it to be true or false. Interesting read. Answers to odd #ed exercises in the back are helpful in determining if you have mastered the concepts or not.
4,It works.,The book seems to be well- structured and does a good job of explaining complex concepts. Some of the examples seem to be flawed but my instructor doesn't use the book all that much anyway.
5,Review of First Person by Vladimir Putin,"I thought that this book was very interesting and contained a lot of information about Russia's president, his family and his career. The format was intriguing also as interviews with President Putin were interspersed with interviews of his wife, his children and close friends. I knew nothing about him when I picked up the book and found it quite fascinating. It is a very easy read and quite compact. I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in the present Russian government."
2,Putin the Innocent,"Only the extremely gullible will be fooled by this book. If you really think that Vladimir Putin is a well-meaning innocent who just happened to work for the KGB for two decades, then ambled over to Sobchak's corrupt administration, then purely by accident became head of Yeltsin's intelligence bureau, and then came to power just when, by a strange coincidence, Russian artillery was flattening every city in Chechnya...if you can swallow all that, then you'll probably enjoy this book.But if you really believe any of that, you probably need to do a bit of remedial reading on recent Russian history far more urgently than you need this book."
4,Good introductory biography of Russia's president,"Vladimir Putin's ""First Person"" is a biography in question and answer format. It gives an insight into the man who is the leader of the largest country in the world. There are questions and answers from not only Putin himself, but also his old school teachers, KGB collegues and his wife and two daughters. Even so, this biography does not give a full picture of the president as a person and much of his past (for example KGB) is not mentioned in great detail (that's why I took off a star) and does not give a deep insight as the book implies. It is a very whitewashed biography of Putin. In fact, I don't recall reading a negative thing about him in this book!! This aside, and all considered, this is an entertaining read and a good introduction to Russia's President; but certainly missing a lot."
5,Reading between the lines,"This seems to be an honest report; a frank and informal look behind the scenes. I doubt that this book of high pressure interviews was written just to make Mr. Putin look good, because, some of the firey comments between him and the interviewers seemed ready to deteriorate into a dog-fight. This guy Putin seems genuine enough and I enjoyed the allusions to his dry sense of humour; Russia needs it. For instance after the 1991 coup the Communist party was graciously allocated an office in a building in Putin's headquarters and they raised a red flag on their flagpole. Day after day Putin ordered someone to take it down and every day the Communists raised a new flag until Putin ordered a crane and had the flagpole cut down with a blow-torch!This is an easy and fascinating read made enjoyable by the bantering style of reporting. After reading between the lines without the ""help"" of the main-stream-media, one can't help but wish the man a fair go."
4,Excellent Album - See Her in Concert,"If you like Tracy Chapman, you will like this album. It's better with each playing. She is a terrific musician and songwriter.I just saw her perform at a small venue (less than 1,000). She rocks in concert! The performance was much less folksy than the albums and Tracy played electric guitar for at least half the songs. I've seen her in huge venues and they overwhelm the sensitivity of her performance.Go see her in concert!"
5,It's the songwriting,"First I give credit to Mitchell Froom and Tchad Blake whose serious appreciation of Tracy is tangible in this recording. Next Tracy's voice is like the fine Zinfandel I enjoyed while listening to this album. Finally it is the great songwriting that places this cd in the excellent category. Although the songs were recorded months before Katrina, some of them [America,Before Easter] are so appropriate during sad/angry reflection on the Gulf Coast tragedy. Tracy Chapman is a wonderful artist who deserves to endure for a very long time."
2,Ok Album,"back in 88 Tracy Chapman was onto something as a Songwriter,Vocalist&Musician,but Her albums over the years have pretty much been the same ole same.Vocally she sounds good,but the album is fairly predictable.standard Arrangements&musicianship. the Bottom line not One song really grabs me,still I always keep a ear on what she does."
2,Coulda Been A Contender,"Tracy Chapman continues to write some of the most heart wrenching songs ever. She's got it down pat, let there be no doubt about it. But you know what? On her other releases there were always one or two numbers that were slightly downtrodden but uptempo that caught your ear and made you want to listen again. There is nothing here that will compel you to listen more than once. Well, maybe twice, just to verify what you thought about it the first time. And she certainly will not win over any new Chapman fans with this cd. Even in this era of the less bombastic (Mraz, Gavin, H.Day, et.al) rock anthems, this music is just a little too lo-fi. I bought this one and I'll probably buy the next one in hopes that she will return to earlier form."
5,Truly Wonderful,"I must say that ""Never Yours"" is one of the most beautiful songs I have ever heard and I highly recomend this Cd to anyone who likes acoustic guitar, inspirational lyrics, and great vocals. I became a Tracy Chapman fan as a young boy and to this day I still enjoy hearing her songs."
4,Great introduction to the Black Sea region,"Charles King creates a very readable overview of the Black Sea civilizations which were many and conflicting. Particularly interesting is the description of the physical characteristics of the Black Sea, the deep dead (anaerobic) zone, the dual currents of the Bosphorus, and the anchovy migrations. The reader gains an appreciation of the Black Sea as a hub in which eastern and western civilizations melded. Maps of the Black Sea area in ancient and modern times are very helpful for those who are not familiar with the geography of the region."
1,Comic book without Images,This book doesn't qualify as a history. Maybe a long wikipedia article. Not much historical meat to this book. Feel ripped off. Unable to harness one new fact in this book. a waste of time and moneyThe Black Sea: A History
5,Solid overview.,"Prior to starting this book, I knew very little, if any, about the Black Sea Region. Upon completion I came away with a much greater understanding of both the geographic area as well as how the regions contributed and continue to contribute differently throughout history. Highly recommend this book to anyone looking for some insight into this part of the world."
2,Uninspiring,"Although well enough written it failed to address the importance of the Black Sea to Eurasian mytho-history as well as it might have. By skittering from period to period it left this reader wanting more about the essential place of the sea. An analytical approach would have been more effective. And by relegating only a small space to the creation of the Black Sea at the end of the last Ice Age and its place in the Flood myths that grew up around this the book failed to really place it ideologically.Not a bad book but overall disappointing for this reader.However, I would recommend this book as a fair introduction to the Black Sea and its history...but I was hoping for a more perceptive read."
5,Wine Pourer,"This little gem works like a diamond. I have used it constantly, and given some as gifts to friends, all of whom also love it. It's very easy to use, clean, and store. The main thing is that it works! I have not dripped a drop of wine since I have started using it."
5,Fantastically simple,"No lenthy review. This works as well as any pouring device I've ever used. It can easily be carried in a purse or wallet, because it's paper thin yet durable. Rinses off easily and dries quickly - no other cleaning necessary."
2,"Not very original, very predictable","I feel like I've seen every aspect of this before. That about covers it.If it's your kind of movie, then fine. I expected more."
2,Not so durable,"The first time we used this cover it tore on the rear axle bolt. It also didn't fit the ""classic"" style bicycle we were placing this on very well, but that was to be expected since it is a one-size-fits-all type of cover."
5,Bike Covers,Very pleased with the bike covers. They came faster than expected. I would buy from this company again.
2,Cover is too small,"I realize the price being so low that I would not receive a top of the line bike cover which is fine. I did expect to receive a cover which would fit my brand new average size mountain bike ~ it does not. since it does not fit over both tires, the plastic snaps that cinch it tight do not come together to make a complete unit. I have to use clothes pins in certain areas to seal the cover in enough area to make the cover at least somewhat useable. My tires and rims are left exposed to the elements and thus are getting mud and moisture on them when it rains. Even the picture to the right of this review shows the cover with ample room all over the bike ~ very misleading!Very disappointed!"
2,So so,"The first time I used the bicycle cover (one of two which I bought), when I went to uncover it, there was a foot-long split in the seam. I taped it up and am using it, but basically, I feel it's a rather chintzy product. Also, it's very hard to figure out how to orient the cover to fit on the bike, but I suppose, since it was inexpensive, it would fit in the category of ""you get what you pay for."""
3,fine for the price,"Rather than go out a buy a drop cloth to cover two kids bikes that I store on an outdoor patio, I bought this thinking the vague shape would fit fine over this somewhat oddly shaped item. It has a little more shape than a flat drop cloth so that is good. However, it's durability is pretty thin like a cheap poncho."
3,Ehhh,I have 26 inch kulana beach cruiser. The handle bars on my bike are too big for this cover. it won't go all the way down.
3,"Good candy, but I don't know if it was worth it.","I bought this kit out of desperation (for all day ""morning sickness""). I've now had this kit for 2 days and have tried everything in it so far. The candys are all pretty tasty, and the spicy ginger candies surprisingly do not cause that (new) feeling of heartburn I am now getting from other spicy things. The tea smells wonderful in the jar. As for whether they work, well all the candies seem to dampen my nausea, but it comes right back after the candy is done. This morning I drank some of the tea with breakfast, and then about an hour or so later WHILE having a BNatal drop I had to take it out of my mouth and run to the bathroom.I plan to keep using the candies (but not the BNatal's), smell the dry tea... and try acupressure wrist bands next."
2,Most disappointing,"The definitive voice of Lieder and Mozart Opera is much-maligned by this inadequate presentation of her lifeTo start with the opening shot of this quasi-documentary is of uninformative, cheesy to say the least, shot of a flower and bee. What follows is a much too short film, lacking in available archive footage. I was left knowing very little more about Miss Schwarzkopf's extra-ordinairy life. Apart from that there were cringing moments when eg the Wienerwald song was played instrumentally with footage of unknown people dancing the waltz out of rhythm of the song. And to top it all, a most delightful recording of Schwarzkopf singing the very same song does exist!Perhaps further research in the subject matter would have helped the director to do this wonderful singer's life and accomplishments justice and produce a true celebration of her art?"
3,Some scenes worked,"Overall this is a great no-brainer weekend movie when there is nothing else to watch. The casting is really good, the writing is pretty good, but when it was all put together it seemed like they were making three different films. Brody delivers the psycho character well but he's in the wrong movie. His acting was so good that it seemed like he was helping a friend make a student film. Chiklis is also very funny and he seems to be in the wrong film. There are great cameos from various actors you will recognize, but beyond the simple plotting and overdone stoner jokes overall it falls flat. The 'What? What?' scene is pretty funny... actually it is very funny... What?"
1,TRUE RATING: MINUS FIVE STARS,"A degrading, stupid, colossal bomb (not in a good way) of a movie. Impaired and offensive and worst of all ""unfunny"" on almost all levels. Brody has a few moments of squint-eyed bewilderment. ""What?"" Wonder how long it took to do his hair and tats? How many years has this dud been on the shelf? Not long enough. Adults made this. (And does the phrase ""Jesus F*****g Christ"" really make this funny? If this kind of language was aimed at Islam or Jews, just imagine the response.)"
4,Easy packaging.,"A little over priced for what it is, but it makes packaging a lot quicker. Unlike tape, this can be easily removed from a package."
4,A good overview on Traffic Safety,This book contains a lot of information. It is written very clear and I can advise it to everyone who is really interested in traffic safety.
1,never got my movie,this may be a good movie but I paid for my order and never received it. I am disappointed about this. I know it is not the sellers fault; they did ship it; but I never received it . I may try to order it again.
3,"Good, But....","This is a movie that benefits from two strong performances and chemistry between its leads.The film follows a paint-by-numbers formula I have seen many times before. The dialogue does not measure up, but the actors make it work.Joaquin Phoenix finally becomes a man and an actor in his own right -living out of the shadow of his legendary deceased older brother River Phoenix.Reese Witherspoon, who has become increasingly one-note and bland (and has the box office flops to prove it - Just Like Heaven, Vanity Fair) finds a role that allows her to stretch for the first time since her breakthrough in Election. Will she win the Oscar? Yes. Does she deserve it? No.The film Hollywood-izes drug addiction and infedlity. Could they make his first wife any more of a witch? But the love these two people share is real and the music is wonderful."
1,not good at all,typical hollywood crap. joaquin does a pale imitation of J.C. i honestly don't know why so many people seem to love this movie. it' a disservice to the man in black.
1,walk the line ( widescreen edition),this has got to be one of the worst movies i have everseen - total waste of time. the story line was garbageand the acting leaves a lot to be desired - stay away fromthis one - it will be just a waste of your money and timeto view this one.
4,GOOD TAKE ON CASH!!,"This movie biopic merits praise simply because Hollywood Movies these days are nothing but garbage. This film is stunningly photographed, though the direction could have been better. Everything is done at a shot and clip pace which is a little distracting. But the actors and their performances outshine the film's flaws. Joaquin Phoenix deserved the Oscar for this performance in this film!! He is incredible and I feel he was robbed. Reese Witherspoon, is a charming, perky, sassy and pretty June and while I certainly agree that her performance is Oscar noteworthy, I feel it should have gone to Joaquin instead if they were going to choose one over the other. Nonetheless, the performances especially during the music scenes which are fantastic, give us a great take on The Man in Black and His Woman!! Well done!!"
2,They had more substance than their portrayal!,"I thought that there was something wrong with this movie. Johnny Cash appears one-dimensional, and the story kept jumping from one incident to another. If they kept a bit of continuity, (like showing how he gained acceptance in his field rather than cut from him making his first record in a country store to being a spectacularly famous singer with a spectacular following) it would more cogent and more enjoyable.I remember Johnny and June Cash as people with more substance than this movie shows. The movie was a poor attempt to capitalize on the memories of these two performers who are still in the minds of much of their public."
4,An excellent film in its own right.,"I was expecting disappointment, along the lines of the Bobby Darin biopic, which failed its subject dismally. However, Walk the Line was well constructed and superbly acted. Johnny Cash himself would have been proud of this work. I would have liked to have seen all the Director's edits restored (shown in the 'Special Features' segment) and a little of the glory that followed with Cash's career progression from where this particular film ends. Cash was clearly a special man, who became an American icon. Pheonix and Witherspoon portrayed their characters with respect and dedication; some final, additional concert footage would have been a treat: the music was wonderfully portrayed and Pheonix captured that magic. The Director's commentary is also a walk through history, superbly delivered. Well done to all concerned - highly recommended!"
4,Well-done and quite interesting,"This movie was well written and well acted. I didn't know anything about Johnny Cash nor June Carter Cash before watching this movie. It gives a lot of insight about Johnny Cash. Joaquin Phoenix plays the role very well. He brings out the vulnerability of Johnny Cash. Reese Witherspoon portrays June Carter Cash as a very strong woman. The movie really shows that Johnny Cash had a lot to overcome in his younger years. When he hit rock bottom, June was there to support him and help him through. Then began the second part of his life when he turned it all around. He was remarkable for being able to work though his troubled childhood, and she was remarkable for being so strong and standing by him. It's a true testament to the power of love. I do recommend this movie."
5,Romantic and entertaining,The story line is awesome and it keeps you glued to the movie. My husband and I both enjoyed the movie and will share it with family members.
4,"""Great Biographical Drama!""","Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon star in this 2005 drama.Biographical story of Johnny Cash becoming a country singerand meeting country singer love, June Carter. Joaquin andReese are great together, but I wish Joaquin got an oscartoo. This special edition has nice picture and sound plusneat extras. I recommend this great drama."
4,A glimpse...would have liked a whole story,"As it seems that biographical movies are the way to go lately, first Ray, then this movie, I'm not surprised to enjoy and look forward to more. What I was surprised at was how they didn't follow the Ray formula...and just gave us a glimpse of Johnny Cash's life.Yes, you saw tragedy in his youth. Yes, you saw that he was an enlisted man, and yes you met his first wife and children. You saw his falling in love with June, and then, the end. That's it. Nothing else happened?Nods to the actors, although Joaquin Phoenix was a little smaller, size wise, then the original Johnny, he still did wonderfully. And his voice was spooky, that was where they seperated from Ray. Just wish we could have gotten more story. You'll like it though."
2,Hollywood version of Cash,"I've been listening to country music since I was a little girl and the visual portrait I have of Cash is a solemn one. He wore black as a somber statement of the state of the world. Sure, he could joke and cut up, but the picture I have of him is not goofy redneck. Phoenix's performance has been hailed as genius, but I wasn't impressed. After all, it was basically a reprisal of his character in ""U-Turn"" in which ""Ring of Fire"" plays each time he appears. This is, of course, a crowd-pleaser and I know many people LOVE it. I hated it so much that I actually walked out of Walk the Line. I understand that this isn't supposed to be a documentary and perhaps I would have enjoyed the portrayal of Cash if I hadn't already had a preconceived notion of who he was. As it stands, I find this film to be both a disappointment and an insult."
4,Oh Reece Reece,she reminds me of an ex I once had. She seems like the girl next door instead of a hollywood star.She can act and act well; not a hollywood diva; at least i dont think so.....This movie touches all aspects of human nature AND ALL THE EMOTIONS OF THAT PARTICULAR SPECTRUM.I recommend it
4,Great Acting Lifts an Otherwise OK Movie,"Reese Witherspoon and Joaquin Phoenix shine in an otherwise typical biopic. While similar to the extrodinary Ray, Walk the Line never rises above movie adequacy. The cuts are too frequent to connect you with Johnny Cash's problem or his recovery. Witherspoon gives the performance of a lifetime as June Carter (Cash). She lights up the screen whenever she arrives and the movie is more than worth watching just to see how talented she actually is.The music is great too, and Phoenix does a terrific job of nailing Cash's warbling, toned voice and his unmistakable swagger."
5,Johnny Cash,If you like Johnny Cash this is a movie to see. Shows you where he came from and how is got to where he was in life. Loved this movie.
5,Great Version of this Movie!,The movie looked and sounded amazing. The cut scenes were put back into the movie seemlessly and to great effect. Anyone who loves this movie should definately get this version!!
5,Best movie even if you don't care for the Cash!,Unbelievable performance by Joaquin so give the award to Reese right?! She was good but what about the Phoenix! HELLO! Its a movie you can watch again and again.
4,Walk the Line,"I am not extremely versed on the life and times of this great musician, so I do not know how critical I can really be when it comes to inaccuracies or not. The strongest points aside from the story however, are the performances by Phoenix and Witherspoon. These two young people deserve a round of applause for their hard work in doing the best they could to portray the characters they represent in this movie. I enjoyed the story of Johnny's past including little details, like his family surviving a flood and of course the traumatic event of him losing his brother which changed his relationship with his father, which seemed somewhat frayed to begin with. The set designers did a great job in really making you feel like you were back in that time period as well. Overall a very enjoyable film that covers a lot of the roads that Cash walked."
2,Joaquin Was Cheated,I cannot fathom why Joaquin Phoenix did not win the Oscar for best actor for his role in this film. He did an amazing job capturing the personae and the sound of the late Mr. Cash. While I like Reese Witherspoon in the Legally Blonde series to me she looks like a high school girl who likes to play dress-up in all of her films and this one was no exception. Johnny Cash was complex and driven by many demons as this film shows. I did not feel that the onscreen chemistry between Phoenix and Witherspoon revealed the true nature of this great love affair.
2,What was all the fuss about?,"Another movie that got me with the hype. At least I was too busy to go to the theatres when it was playing so I didn't waste a trip.I watched this with friends and was twiddling my thumbs with boredom. It was just like any other musician movie where. outside their jobs, the musicians have pretty mundane uninteresting lives.I was worried something was wrong with my attention span but then someone suggested turning it off and everyone agreed immediately!We all wondered - whats the fuss about?I think the acting was pretty good but it is hard to tell with a script this mediocre!"
2,why did she win,Reese was just ok his first wife did a better job acting I give this movie a b - Terry
2,Far from Oscar,"If your interest in this film is an Oscar performance from Witherspoon, you will be disappointed. Accomplishing a credible southern accent is far from qualifying for an Oscar performance. By contrast, Phoenix delivers his usual good acting that gets lost in a pretty mediocre film."
3,OKAY.,"Dvd was not in spectacular shape. Price was great, but had some scratches and freezes in some spots. Wasn't very happy with this buy, expected it to be in better shape. But overall the price was wonderful and shipping was fast."
4,Insight to the creative process,"Any one of these DOC-U-DRAMAS genres (Ray, Sonny & Cher, Elvis, The Ronnettes, etc) offer a glimpse into a time when we were all listening to what was happening in the world and the music of these artist took us away, brought us back and still take us on a time journey - my favorite scene here was in Sun Records studio, when Cash was told ""play somethig from YOU - something that people will remember YOU by when your gone"" and the creative flow poured out of that man and guitar in Folsom Prison Blues. Truly a magic moment! Well worth the watch, sit back and enjoy - the life of the man in black."
5,Walk The Line - Simply An Amazing Picture,"Walk The Line is definitly my favorite movie of the year. Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon are absolutly amazing as Johnny Cash and June Carter. Their voices amazed me because before the movie, both of them couldn't sing a note! I hope it gets a whole lot of Oscar nominations, including Best Picture, Best Actor and Best Actress. I'd love to see this again in theaters. I simply can't wait to purchase this awesome movie when it comes out on DVD. SEE THIS AWESOME MOVIE! I promise, you will be taken back by the outstanding acting and the awesome music of Johnny Cash."
4,"Great Film, but the Collector's Edition is a Disappointment","This review is not to argue the merits of the film. ""Walk the Line"" is a wonderful story of love and redemption. Reese Witherspoon deserved her Best Actress Oscar for her portrayal of June Carter, and Joaquin Phoenix's performance is of equal caliber. It's a great movie, definitely worth seeing.The reason for this posting is to tell people that the Collector's Edition is a waste of money. The bonus features in this more expensive version are a huge disappointment. After watching the film you would hope to see a revealing documentary about the real people. However, there's no footage of Johnny or June singing, no interviews with them, nothing but a couple of still photos. The three bland featurettes are just a series of clips from the film and some interviews where people ""talk about"" Johnny and June. What a wasted opportunity.If you want to buy the movie, stick with the basic version and save yourself a few bucks."
3,"An ""ok"" movie",I thought it was lacking. It was long and hard for me to get through the whole movie. It might just be I am not a big Johnny Cash fan.
5,where's the sequel,"Where's the sequel? I'm ready for the rest of the story. Producers should call me, people say I sound just like John when I sing. Also, I have a picture of John and I together and I must say with some make up and a hair style change I could resemble the man in black enough to be believable.ANYWAY, the movie was great and the extra documenteries was worth the extra bucks and I cry too Marshal EVERYTIME I think of how much John and June meant to me too. I miss them as much as if they were my own parents."
4,Cashes in a Silver,"Johnny Cash may be known for many things; music, outlaw/rebel personas and more, but his love is as concrete and true as all his other images. The ""Man in Black"" with a ""Freight-Train Voice"" displays his life-time joys and sorrows that propelled him up inot the music status of Icon. Reese Witherspoon and Joaquin Pheniox both gave a Grammy knock-out preformance, that either has yet to top (I think Joaquin was still in character during Lettermen), in this true tale of love, addiction and music. This may not be a Film of the Ages, but it surely is a fine trubute to Mr. J.R. Cash."
5,I Can Die Happy Now!,"Mr. Phoenix for my is in the top 10 male performances ever you only had to see him in Gladiator to know what i am talking about, I love Reese Whiterspoon too, she is very talented, without a doubt my favorite actress ever(both Joaquin and Reese are my favorite actors) and his chacter in the movie was lovely, their make a great duo like Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhall in Brokeback Mountain,the music is ""Perfect,Outstanding, Superab..."", one things i like in this movie is the chemistry between Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Whiterspoon thats make the film so powerfull and Flawless ,direction was ""fantastic"" this movie deserves to be nominated for best picture too, Walk the line by far is my favorite flick of this year,there another excellent movies in 2005 like King Kong, Sin City, Star Wars episode 3, Brokeback Mountain, Crash,Munich... i like them but Walk The Line will be my favorite of 2005 and one of my favorites of all time."
5,A must see,"My wife and I are long time fans of Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash. We went to see the movie a few days ago and were very moved by the movie. It was well put together, the acting was great and the singing was was very close to original. We were amazed by almost exact mannerism's of Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal of Johnny Cash. The singing was very good and it was as if Johnny was singing again. It depicts a very troubled life, full of despair and pain. But the love and strength of God and of a wonderful woman helps to pull this man from his crying out. He becomes a great man with incredible strength and a solid life based on his faith in God. We have almost every album of Johnny Cash and will buy this movie also."
3,Pretty good film,"I truyl enjoyed the acting performance of Joaquin Phoenix as Johnny Cash,though overall he was missing that edge that Reese Witherspoon brought as June Cash.I think Her Performance is what got her awarded the Oscar.the film was well put together.just was missing something which kept it from being very good to great. still the Chemstry between Phoenix&Witherspoon is on point. good to see the film acknowledging many of the Highs&Lows of Johnny Cash's Musica career."
4,Good Movie,This is a great movie. Would have prefered to be able to watch it for a longer period of time.
4,It's a good film and at times great but at times you want more,"I enjoyed this film but it's not as good as everyone was saying it was. The film is good and at times the film is great but at times you want more with the film. The film is about Johnny Cash and his love for June Carter but that's about it. I found there could of been more of a story then there was. the acting is good from Joaquin Phoenix who doserves his oscar nod and he might win, Reese Witherspoon shines (she shines in everything) and she might win an oscar too (I found soem of the other actress in the catoagory better then her). Overall the film is good and I recomand it you will be mesmerized at times through the film."
3,The June and Johnny story is more like it,"The story basically was about how Johnny wanted June very badly, and how long it took for them to get together. After they get together, the movie ends quickly. I dont know Johnny or June to much, the acting was good but not excellent. I thought Reese Witherspoon did an amazing job as June though. The part that I rolled my eyes at was an almost minute scene with Johnny with Waylon Jennings, who was played by his son, Skeeter Jennings. I thought it was a little tacky and would have prefered to see someone play Bob Dylan. Plus forget to tell the story about Johnny kicking out the lights at the Grand Ol Opry. That would have been cool to see. Go see it for Reese Witherspoon as June Carter, other then that, a weak biography of the man in black."
2,Walking on thn ice.,"A good biography is hard to make. Here are some of the things I didn't like about this movie.1- Struggle between man and woman relationship. This movie comprised too much of Reese Witherspoon's character. I would have preferred the focus remain on his music and the birth of his fame and events to follow.2- I would have liked if the movie went beyond the 60's and looked at him in the 1980's and so forth.3- I didn't think the father and son relationship was focused enough on and why did Johnny Cash not better defend himself against a heartless dad? His dad was not a good dad but he is not even in the middle of the picture, not until the end.4- Reese Witherspoon , though a good actor, has become rather dull in her approach to acting and quite predictable. I was getting annoyed with her about mid way thru the script.Sorry, but this movie isn't as good as those who "" walk the line"" say it is. Thanks."
2,Huh? What?,"My thoughts exactly. The pacing of movie was terribly slow. I was moved a single time during the movie: when John's father cruelly told him that it should have been him who died. The plot of the movie seemed stagnant as the majority of the movie consisted of John wanting June. In the end, I only felt empathy for Jack."
2,for the casual fan only,"no, no, no. i just can't get past joquain's portrayal of CASH. his voice just doesn't cut it, and the musical numbers are painful to watch. if CASH actually sounded like that, he never would have been popular. i think the ball was dropped by the casting of this movie...i am positive that there are better fits for CASH out there than phoenix. when you're dealing with such a legend, it behooves you to make the right choice. i guess i'm just too big of a CASH fan, of course i understand that no one can ever be CASH but i just feel that this movie would have been better with different lead actors (yes, reese is cute but she ain't no june neither!) plus, the movie paints a very shallow picture of CASH as a pill popping freak. one more thing...phoenix's acting is pretty terrible as well. he looks like a monkey when he tries to mimic CASH's facial expressions. go back and watch some vintage CASH footage, you'll see what i mean. way overacted. this movie is wayyyyyyyyy overrated!"
3,Somewhat bland,"My rating is actually pretty kind. I love Joaquin and he did a phenominal job, but the movie itself was kind of on the boring side. It dragged way too long and the length should definetely have been cut. There are a few bright spots, like the acting and music, but perhaps its that I am just not a fan of the biopic type films."
3,"Great video, poor audio.",Many times one cannot here what the actors are saying. Was the original movie audio like this?
5,Inspiration.,"Joaquin Phoenix does a breath taking job at portraying Johnny Cash. The mannerisms, the facial expression, the way he held his guitar and hunched his head over, while grinning--perfect. Reese Witherspoon is beautiful as June Carter, and the two of them together constantly steal the show from each other. It must also be said that both of these actors use their own voices for the songs, and that's saying a lot because the music in this movie is amazing.The story, the music, the progression of the events is very well done. One, upon watching the movie, is totally immersed in Mr. Cash's world. They feel what he feels, see what he sees. This two hour movie takes us through the past, on an amazing trip in Johnny Cash's shoes as he walks the line.10/10 Classic."
4,Walk with the Line of fans to a Grrreeat Movie!,"Walk the Line was an amazin movie.I gots myself all warmed up to it before i even gots the chance to watch it. I'm a huge fan of Mr.Johnny Cash's music. Yes sir, i feels at home watchin' it in the comfort of my ol' reliable flat 20"" Toshiba screen.It brought me joy to know that Reese Witherspoon, a southern belle would portray the lovely Ms.June Carter in Walk the Line. She deserved to win the award she did. It made my wife cry every time she said no to Phoenix's proposals as Cash.The only reason i give this movie one star less was because there wasn't enough songs in my opinion.The songs was heart-warmin' and i hope that my lil boy will watch it when he grows up."
5,OK by ME!,"After reading some of the other reviews I'm thinking that if you're a life-long, die-hard Johnny Cash fan, you will not appreciate this movie. I, for one, knew little about him and wasn't prticularly interested in his music. Let me tell you, I just ordered an album of songs by Johnny Cash."
5,The Story of Man in Black,"Johnny Cash is legend to those of us boomers. Mystique of that gravely voice tied with drugs and prisons and broken love life here portrayed in vignette display of this fascinating life.Beginning and end ties with loss of his brother with sawmill accident, then wait to appear on stage with woodworking blade provide overall bookends to Cash's life.Seems like the oft told story of a basic human's life filled with basics we all enjoy, family, religion, etc. which then goes bad under constant cooker of touring, alcohol, pressure, drugs, away from wife and family, etc. boy the ties here on dramatic, Elvis, Jerry Lee Lewis, etc.They do an outstanding job with the music, Phoenix and Witherspoon."
5,Maybe I am...,"As a die-hard Johnny Cash fan, I had looked forward to this movie for at least a year. After watching the trailers, I was slightly afraid it would be overacted and hard to watch(all the commercial scenes seemed a bit overdramatized, after all), but still had to see this movie. After watching it, however, I was amazed. It is close to a perfect movie.Joaquin and Reese really put a lot into their performances. I was skeptical about them doing their own singing when I heard about it, but they did a super job. While they're clearly no Johnny and June, the two's singing fits in perfectly with the movie. Anyway, I was very satisfied with this. It didn't change history to attract viewers, and it didn't breeze over the hard parts of his life. It skipped some things, but that would be necessary for the time limit. A very well-made movie, with plenty of small details thrown in throughout. I recommend it to any Johnny Cash fan, or to anybody, for that matter."
4,Flashback/flashforward Johnny Cash and June Carter Revisited,"Charming film....power to the June Carter depiction which shows not only love and lust but also the other side of each of those coins which may not be so glossy or shiny...when you're with a charismatic personality like Johnny Cash who strives to overcome his own self-made obstacles and skeletons in his family closet and at the same time keep your true to yourself. Reese Witherspoon is fabulous...her singing, her charm...is this the same actress as in CLUELESS or Legally Blond? What a sophisticated performance with many shades of color and tone. Phoenix does a good job and especially when he's seen as a performer. The prison scene is awesome and probalby worth the price itself to see that concert. You can go home again and this movie proves it helps to have your own cheerleader and soul partner."
5,"""I WALK THE LINE"" is an absolute must see","My wife and I went to see this movie the day after Thanksgiving. It is the first time we've been to a movie theatre in two years because none of the ""predominately computer generated slash em and gash em garbage that Hollywierd calls movies have been worth going to see"". I Walk The Line was a refreshing change!The cast performances were excellent and Phoenix and Witherspoon were astounding! This is a must see for Country music fans, regular music fans, and nostalgia fans.In my humble opinion, anyone who could give this movie a bad review, is someone who just can't be pleased!We can't wait for the DVD"
3,"This is a GREAT movie, 5 stars...but...","This particular version, the ""Collector's"" edition, is not worth the extra money. I was hoping for extras that had actual footage of Johnny and June, but what the extras all appear to be is just additional promo material for the movie itself. I would have loved to see even stills of the concert at Folsom, rather than them talking about ""John"" and showing footage of Joaquin. Not that he didn't give a masterful performance, it just wasn't what I expected or thought I was getting."
3,Times A-Wastin',"I so much wanted to like this movie better than I actually did.The lead performances are good. Oscar worthy? I'm not sold on that. I like Witherspoon, but thought Phoenix's performance was stronger. I found their vocal performances to be well done. Not a forced imitation of Carter or Cash, but more of an homage.Maybe it was the editing - but the story didn't flow well. There wasn't a good portrayal as to why June and John were attracted to each other. And Cash's detox program was the shortest shown in any movie or Lifetime special. We are also to infer that some healing went on w/Johnny and his father - but considering most of the conflict in the movie is based on their relationship, I don't think it would have been too much to play that out a bit.The extras are barely that. Commentary and languages. The deleted scenes, as with most dvds, add nothing and were ripe for cutting from the movie in the first place."
5,"BEST MUSIC BIO-PIC SINCE ""THE DOORS""","""Walk the Line"" is the best musical bio-pic since Val Kilmer portrayed Jim Morrison in ""The Doors."" Phoenix and Witherspoon were superb. The music was top-notch, edgy because they sang them imperfectly but well. Reece got that June Carter Cash twang just about right. Johnny Cash's music is pure Americana. To understand the heartland, one must immerse and learn from the sounds, the stories and the message of Cash's great songs. This film captured Cash's imperfect, sinful nature that always contrasted with his great love of Christ his Savior."
4,Joaquin is hot,"It didn't scream with power the way ""Ray"" did last year, but this is a pretty good film. Johnny Cash had a broodier personality than I realized, but it was because he felt incomplete without June Carter.Much like Ray Charles, Cash was also traumatized by the death of a brother. However, there the similarities end. In ""Ray"", it was revealed that Ray Charles loved music above all else, including his own family and the many, many women. For Cash, his heart's desire was for one woman only: June Carter...an obsession that drove him to drug addiction. I liked this approach to the film versus focusing on Cash's rise to fame. This flaw makes him seem more human and less iconic.Joaquin Phoenix is hot in this film and did a wonderful job; Reese certainly deserved this Oscar...her best role to date. Forget Vanity Fair."
5,Very Entertaining Biopic with Great performances from both actors.,Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon are both wonderful in the roles of Johnny Cash and June Carter. This is basically a film about their relatonship viewed through the lense of Cash's career and struggles with family and drug abuse. The film is extraordinarily entertaining from beginning to end and the musical sequences are very well done. Both actors deserve a lot of credit for doing the singing and making the performance sequences realistic. No doubt Witherspoon deserved her Oscar and Phoenix was equally deserving in a tough field.Having seen Capote and this I think it would be a close call but I'd have given the award to Phoenix.Overall this is an uplifting story about a love between two people who were obvious soulmates and survived in an environment that makes long term marriages a challenge at best. Very enjoyable film.
5,One of the best DVDs in our collection,It was even better the second time we watched. Good songs on disc 2.
3,My expectations might have been too high.,"I was a little disappointed with the story. Joaquin Phoenix just didn't line up with Johnny Cash for me. June Carter Cash was a handsome women but not like Reese Witherspoon who isextremely attractive (cute). That said both actors did remarkably excellent jobs singing. Cry Cry Cry was very effective. Two others Cocaine Blues & Get Rhythm are not heard very often. A lot of the movie was wasted on John's sophmoric pursuit of June. Sometimes he was married or she was married to someone else. It didn't matter to him. He begs her to marry him. It was childish & pathetic as portrayed. A very short movie without that nonsense. Of course the best parts were the stage performances of both of them. So, it's okay & I recommend it."
3,Where's the beef?,"This film seemed to be more of an overview. It focused more on his exploits and early life.In the film we see that he drank, smoked, did drugs, cheated on his wife and wore a lot of black clothing. More could have been done to show - OK he had his vices, he pulled himself together,created great music and here's how. Also we did not see anything about his later life and marriage to June Carter. Why was this completely left out and so much of the early problems shown?The acting in the film was great and the film is entertaining. The writers had an opportunity to show that even though Johnny Cash had problems through out his life that he overcame them, moved on and even more. Instead they sold out and gave us sex, drugs (and in this case) Country Music."
2,Extras Disc is Terrible - just buy the cheaper movie only edition,"The ""extras"" are all out-takes and posed pictures of Joaquin and Reese in-character. Very disappointing as some historic pictures and video of June and Johnny could have added some rich context for the movie.I actually wish I had never seen them - as it just cheapens an otherwise great movie."
3,cash,wonderful performances by phoenix and wither spoon; script a little hackneyed; good date movie; johnny cash lives on
1,Disappointed,"We bought this movie expecting to see a movie about Johnny Cash's life. And it had some decent parts, but this movie only tells about part of his life, in typical Hollywood fashion. My whole family is a fan of Johnny Cash, and the way Hollywood portrayed the Man in Black is almost sickening. Yes, he had a rough life, but he turned around. BIG TIME! If you are a fan of Johnny Cash and want to stay that way. I wouldn't recomend this movie."
1,I KNEW BETTER...,"It's sad to watch memories of the real deal fade in to a middle-finger t-shirt, Walk the Line dvd, ""I love Cocaine Blues"", punk/rockabilly anti-hero oblivion in these 'modern' times. If anyone ever reads this and doesn't understand that statement or becomes offended by it... well??? There is memory a friend of mine shared with me of Johnny and June playing back in either the late 80's or early 90's. They both stayed(unexpectedly) over 2 1/2 hrs after their show ended to meet and listen to each and every person that wanted to speak with them. The show was held at small Otoe bingo hall here in Oklahoma. My friend's memory of their conversation, the feeling that Johnny and June left him and ,of course, June's kiss on his cheek were held in high regard amongst his many reflections. Moments like those and the true spirit of the 2 folks that brought them to millions of people on this earth are not documented at all in this motion picture. A waste."
3,Disappointed,While Reese Witherspoon was delightful I found Joaquin Phoenix to be one dimensional and boring. I didn't care for the movie at all.
3,GOOD.......... NOT GREAT!,"I liked this movie, but it just didn't seem to do justice to the subject. I much prefer ""Coal Miners Daughter"" as a Biography. The cast does well, but the movie feels choppy to me. I didn't feel like I learned anything about Cash from this and there were huge chunks of his life missing. It is still a good film with it's many flaws and the DVD looks very good. Worth renting, but I wouldn't buy it."
3,A Thin Line,"I was not exactly feeling this movie, but I did give it a chance. It was entertaining and the music numbers were great, they were the best part of the movie. I liked Joaquin Phoenix better in ""To Die For"" and I liked Reese Witherspoon better in ""Election"". I think Reese Witherspoon should have won an Oscar for that role rather than this one. But she did a good job with the musical numbers even though she definatley does not have a genuine country voice. (Even she herself admits she can't really sing 100 %). I was more impressed with the music ""bio"" about Ray Charles with Jamie Foxx. It was a much better film than this. Alot of other people including my neighbor and the people at the video store agreed that this wasn't that great of a movie!"
3,"""Ray with white people"" indeed...","Joaquin Phoenix does as good a job as anyone could do portraying the Man in Black. Too bad the movie wasn't a little better. I think Jon Stewart called this ""Ray with white people"" at the Oscars, and that's about right. The music scenes are great, the standard self-destructive rock star stuff is sort of a drag... bottles are broken, a sink is pulled out of the wall, drugs are abused... yawn. Also I wasn't buying the love story between Johnny and June -- thankfully their real life relationship was deeper than this.Grade: C"
5,Journal,"This journal is exactly what I was looking for. It is nothing special but very nice. It has lines but they are not too dark so as not to distract from the writing. It is smaller than my other paperblank journals, only about 7x5"". It's cover is magnetic so it stays shut. One thing, from the picture I thought it was a chocolate brown color, but it really is black.. not a big deal to me but maybe to some other people. I hope this helps."
3,Journal,It was a very pretty journal but the binding was pretty stiff which made writting in it very hard especially being a left handed person. Otherwise it was a nice book.
4,great striaghtfoward salsa,"If you're looking for a good disc of straight-ahead modern salsa then you couldn't get any better than this one. The songs are intricate and very listenable, and the musicianship is absolutely incredible.My personal favorite is ""Perdoname"", which has an awesome percussion solo break halfway through that could almost be in a latin rap song. When I lived in the Dominican Republic the song was a moderate hit and never ceased to pull people out onto the dancefloor."
5,Reviewer Missed the Boat!,"Unlike the reviewer that thinks this CD is not worth the buy, me and pretty much every other reviewer of this CD agree that this is a very good CD, as a matter of fact this is a GREAT CD! From the sound quality, the band, the songs, the dialogues, the audience, this CD is what a Live CD should be!!! Perdoname is done in a way that is completely remarkable, and i'm mostly refereing to the Soneo he does in this song!!! Gilberto is very talented. If you dont own this CD, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR!!!!!"
5,Incredible voice!,This is an unbelievable CD. There is not one so-so song. You will not go wrong with this one!
2,It's like having x-ray vision but getting cancer from it.,"The Nyko Wii Intercooler does what it says it does - cool down your wii, even when it's on standby - and it's very good at that. There is one huge problem that I have with it, which made me plug it in once, then take it out and never use it again - the noise it makes. It's extremely loud and makes a high-pitched buzzing noise. It is very distracting and I can't even pay attention to the game with it on. I will never use this again, I'll probably sell it."
4,S'Wii-t,"Keeps your Wii nice and cool. Like most have said, the main defect of Wii's is that the internal fan does not adequately cool the Wii. And this lil guy does! Yeah, it's a lil loud the first week or two, and sometimes when you fire up the Wii is sounds like it is grinding...just turn the Wii off then back on, or jiggle the fan itself...no biggie! Again, as for the noise of the fan, i am usually listening to music or playing with friends so it is not an issue...but keeping my Wii investment nice and cool is an issue. And that's why i got this lil guy!"
5,Works,"Does the job, my Wii is still working after 2 years. I bought it because my wii is in a place with no ventilation at all."
1,buy it if you like a noise and want it to break in about a year,this was a really great item for the first year. it worked great. but then after about a year and a half it stopped working. this is also a really loud device. so if you want to buy another one in a year and you like noise i would recommend this product to you.
4,cooler,"This cooler seems to keep the unit cool, and I have the console mounted in a cabinet with the TV. It is a bit noisy and would like to see a way turn it off when not needed, but it is in the rear and inaccesable, but does go off when theconsole is shut off. It mounted easily, and I am glad I ordered it. I certainly does what it was created for"
3,Nice but incomplete,"This it's a nice fan, more nicer than those that operate with Batt.But some times even after I turn off the Wii the fan will never stop until you unplug the Wii from the AC cord."
4,Good results for a good price,"I ordered this accessory online to boost another purchase over $25 (to get the free shipping). I liked that it was cheap and that the other reviews were good. Be warned, this product looks extremely dinky when it arrives, as it only covers the fan opening in the back of the Wii (maybe 2"" x 2""). However, it is extremely effective in keeping it cool, and should add life to your system. Definitely worth the purchase!"
3,work but is to loud,"sorry for my english:I think this cooler works, but it makes a lot of noise. I will only play with noisy games."
5,A wonderful book!,"I love this book! This is the second time I read the book, and still , I enjoy it so much. this book is filled with such feeling. I love the way Duncan is always trying to protect Madelynes feelings. I love the way he makes sure no one hurts her. The dialogue is witty, the story is fast paced. It's just wonderful. I would say this is my favorite Julie Garwood book, but I love them all.. The entire book is great.. I can't think of one thing I would change about it.. Buy this book It is great!"
4,guilty pleasure,"This is a book I'd classify as a guilty pleasure. Not in the sense that I'd hide it from anyone else, but in the sense that though I realize it's not very good, I enjoy it anyway.In this case, the heroine is just too naive to be believable, but it makes the book very funny anyway. As long as I ignore the little voice in my head that says she should be able to learn something eventually.Her naivete makes sense at first--she was raised by elderly priests--but it goes on too long, and she doesn't seem to learn anything.Still, as I said, it's very funny. There's adventure and romance, and a heck of a lot of humor, but it's one of those books that I have to turn off my internal critical reader to enjoy."
3,Honor's Splendour,"I bought this book thinking it was going to be a very good book. I love romance novels and this is actually the first book I read from Garwood. This book was not as good as I had thought it'd be. Sort of disappointed. I couldn't wait to finish it because I find it alittle boring. I did love the fact that he secretly vowed that she belongs to him all because she has shown him kindness by warming his feet unpredictably. The romance between them was sweet over all, but the ending of the plot could've been written better."
4,"great book, wish it was longer","This is a great book, although I felt the beginning was kinda hard to get into. But like all J.G. books, you're soon pulled in. I thought that maybe there could have been less of an impact from Louddon. The ending was too abrupt. I really enjoyed the part where her fever made her hallucinate! HAHA! But I thought they should have told her what she had done. I hate characters being left in the dark!! Maybe the author could have elaborated a bit on Rhinehold since Madelyne did find out that he was her father. The Henry and William bit was unnecessary, in my opinion. And I felt so sorry for the younger brother because he wanted her too, but Duncan took her for his own!I think there could have been minor improvements that could have made this book better, but overall, it's still a joy to read!"
3,Not my cup of tea,"I am surprised by the number of 5 stars review for this book.I find it a little boring and dragging. And it is especially hard to like a female character that is always sighing (typical garwood) and clumsy. It was only towards the end part that she showed more spunk outwardly.I have read a number of JG's books, and am getting tired of her typical characters. Females were always sighing, controlled, trying to be a gentle lady. Males were always huge giant, broody, don't talk much and cannot accept fact that they can fall in love and become 'weakened' by it initially.Once in a while, give us some changes."
2,Blah.,"Here's the sad truth: I'm too bored by this story to give it only one star. One star deserves passion, and I can't muster up the energy to hate it that strongly.I enjoy Julie Garwood's contemporary stories--they aren't that complex, but at least I find them entertaining. Her historical romances, on the other hand, just don't have enough substance to hold my attention. I keep thinking I'll give her another chance, but I think this is the last one."
5,Sweet,"I have read over 10 of Julia Garwood books, not one have I not liked. I'm a sucker for romance and this one is a success, a must read!"
5,Great reading!,I read this book a few years ago and I loved it! I love it more that I can do the audio version at the same it! I would definately recommend this book.
4,A GREAT READ,"""Honor's Splendour"" has it all. Romance, intrigue, mystery, humor and drama. I love the way Julie Garwood begins this story with Madelyne rescuing Duncan (and warming his feet) and him capturing her. With this unusual twist, this story heads full-tilt into a great plot. Duncan's intentions aren't very honorable in the beginning (he's seeking revenge for his sister's rape), but Madelyne's honest nature baffles him (he expected her to be like her diabolical brother and she's not) and he's forced to adjust his plan. It's great fun to watch Madelyne send Duncan's life, and those of his brothers and sister, into a tail-spin.Although the long-anticipated first love scene comes much later than hoped for in this book, Julie Garwood does do a great job of building the sexual tension between these two characters. The sub-plots with Adela and Louddon add great depth to this captivating story, as well. It's a great read!"
5,Fantastic!,"I have never cared for romance novels until I read ""Gentle Warrior"" by Julie Garwood. I love stories that are set back in the days of kings and barons just like these two do. You begin to understand the characters of this book and share their hardships as well as their joys. It's definitely not something you can put down without a fight. It is a fantastic storey that has you crying like a baby, laughing your head off, and falling in love like a innocent young maiden."
3,Not Nearly As Good As MOST of her books!,"If first time readers loved this one, they'll definitely love Saving Grace, Ransom, and many other JG novels, except Rebellious Desire.This book was okay but it fell flat to me. It was easily recognizable as a JG book, but it lacked pizazz; the plot and characters didn't quite hold my interest. But I do LOVE this author!"
3,Honor's Splendour,I enjoy listening to books on CD's and Julie Garwood. Was happy with the service and the delivery. Will order more books on CD's.
2,SIMPLY DO NOT BOTHER!,Julie Garwood failed me in this one. While nicely researched it is the typical white night rescues princess. Save your money and hope that Julie goes more toward the detective series shich happens to be my favorites. This one was just a bust in my book- bad pun- sorry!
3,Well Done for its Genre,This book was well paced and had a good story. I guess I am tiring of Romances after having read so many over the last few years. I long for meatier fare.
3,Not that great,sorry to say folks but i didn't really enjoy this one as much as the others. I have to say it was a good story but i just wasn't impressed with madelyne. most of garwood's characters have that innocence about them that can be annoying but madelyne just got on my nerves. however duncan was a great character. to me madelyne seemed to be made of fluff. BUT READ IT YOURSELF IF THIS BOOK APPEALS TO U. however i haven't tried to read the entire book twice.
1,*sigh* Never again.,"This is the second, and last, book I'll ever read by Julie Garwood. I gave her a second chance because we all know that even the best author can turn out a crappy book (see The Reluctant Suitor by Kathleen Woodiwiss). I just do not like the way that Julie Garwood writes a conversation. It seems to me that she is one of those authors that sacrifice quality for quantity. Her books are completely forgettable."
5,Wonderfull Book!,"This is one of those books that I can read over and over again. I bought it years ago and still find myself reading it.Madelyne is a wonderfull charcter, with her own dark past and path in life. Until she meets, or rescues, Duncan.This is a truely unique book, which strays from the usual plot and charcter dynamics."
3,Okay,"The beginning was GREAT, then something happened and it kind of idled through the middle, then toward the end it picked up and became okay (maybe a little too fantastical--but nonetheless, okay).Madeline was not so much an innocent as she was dumb. The hero was wonderful! I did, however, notice many similarities to other books of hers I've read."
3,Not a bad historical romance...,"This is my first historical romance by Julie Garwood and I have to say as far as historical romances that I've read go, its one of the better ones. The main characters were fleshed out pretty well, but I have to say I really enjoyed the secondary characters more. Anthony and the brothers.... Love them! I don't know if they have their own stories, but it is definitely something I will have to look into. The story was pretty good, however, parts of it especially in the middle was drawn out a bit too much, and I feel like we needed to see more of Madelyne's brother especially since he was the villain of the story. I am not much of a fan of historical romances, but I was pleasantly surprised by my enjoyment of this one. Out of 5 stars I give it 3.5."
1,Blah!,"I love Julie Garwood books, besides Judith McNaught she is my favorite author. Which is why I was so dissapointed with this novel. It is her worst novel yet. I couldn't even finish it without skipping parts."
2,Started Out Good,"This book started out good but the character started wearing thin on me. I am half way through and don't even care if I finish. Madelyn is really bugging me. She cries all the time. At first, it was ok. She was experiencing a lot of real trauma but then she started crying over everything and her character became really insipid. Duncan started getting pretty boring, too. I don't understand the great reviews. The chemistry was good at first. After awhile, of all the ""holding back"", I didn't care if they were together or not. Oh, and she starts becoming very clumsy. Huh? I don't get it. Because she is finally free is the explanation. This causes clumsiness? The author doesn't dwell on this but I'm so bored with this book I think I will just go buy another."
4,"Not my favorite, still very good though.","I found myself hoping that Duncan and the wolf were actually one in the same. Yes I'm a paranormal romance reader as well. While this would'nt rank among my favorite JG books I would still recommend it. Duncan is hot (even if he is only human lol.) And I found myself laughing several times which I love. So yes, definately recommend."
5,I think this was my first Garwood...,"Garwood is one of my favorite historical romance authors (her contemporaries aren't as good, but that's another review). I think this was my first book by her. Her stories are funny and ""light"" (not as emotionally wrenching as other historical romance authors can be), and I always feel good when I finish one. The only books that get 5 stars from me are those that are keepers (rereads). This one fits that definition. The tension/romance between the h/h is just right, with plenty of witty dialogue and romantic love scenes. Well done!"
2,Couldn't Finish,"Julie Garwood is a good author but I admit some of her books I do not like. What spoiled this one was the heroine, who claims she is a gentle maid yet makes out with her captor the first night. She throws tantrums, whines about her captors not liking her, and while at times she seems to have a spine, too many times she does not and you just want to shake her. Gentle maid or an idiotic one? The rest of charactors are pretty standard but good. The handsome and fierce hero and the evil villain who lusts after above maid. I wish this one had been a freebie."
1,I'd rate it lower if I could,"There are many books for children of a deployed mother. Try Mommy Wears Combat Boots, or perform a search for others... Anyhoo, this book is a nice thought but it is not exceptionally well written and the pictures used in it are REEAAALLLYYY bad. They're occassionally nearly unrecognizable."
4,Not bad,"The bag holds all my loose hand tools well, my only complaint is that the interior pockets are so shallow that larger items have a tendancey to fall out into the main compartment. I'd still recommend this item."
4,"Durable, comfortable, and organized",I bought this because all my hand tools were in drawers and scattered on my workbench. Everytime I started to work on something I never had all the necessary tools and would have to run back and forth for the tools I needed. I got this home and I filled my new bag. Very pleased with how much I could get in there and organize. Also very pleased with how strong it is. Now I just grab the bag and go.
4,McGuire Nicholas' Builder's Tool Bag,"We have found this to be a very convenient way of transporting essential tools from one job to the next. The bag is roomy and is great for any kind of tool. We are presently using the bag to carry our battery operated circular saw, which fits very nicely into the bag."
1,STILL WAITING & WAIT EVEN LONGER!!!,"I am still waiting for this item, and I, too, ordered it in late December. The other two bonus items came quickly, but it was the bag I really wanted most! Come on people...and today my delivery estimate CHANGED to add another MONTH????You've got to be kidding me."
3,Slide handle pole is NOT a telescoping handle pole,"As of the date I purchased this item (July 2007), the image is of a ""Telescoping Handle"" pole, however, the title of the item identifies it as a ""Slide Handle"". After receiving the product I realized that ""telescoping"" and ""slide"" are not the same thing. I read the manufacturers website [...]and realized the difference between these two words.""Telescoping"" expands the length of the pole from one usable length to an almost double length, while still being usable.""Slide"" just means that the pole can be released from its fixed, usable length, and tucked down to the size of the net, making it more compact, but unusable, for storage."
2,For beginers ONLY,I was disappointed with this book. I have purchased a lot of soap books and found this to be the only one i havent used. It is really only for beginers with no challenges for someone trying to spread their wings. It has melt & pour recipes only. one recipe was to use a finshed bar of soap and told you how to put a tattoo transfer on it. That was it. Inspiring!
2,ANOTHER DISAPPOINTED READER,"Exciting romantic suspense????? Obviously Harriet Klausner read a different book. Maybe something by Susan Andersen? I have to agree with Disappointment from New York. I WANTED to like this book. Reinventing Romeo was a fun read. However, I found myself skipping great portions of Romancing Riley. Too much ""head"" conversation and not enough real conversation. Riley was just too much period - not sympathetic. Again, I agree with New York. Just could not like Riley. I hope Ms. Lane's next book is better, but the brief preview in the back of Romancing Riley did not bode well."
4,"A great guide, but look for the new edition.","This is a great guide book to hiking and photography Denali, but if you are considering buying this book, look for the new edition. It is titled Denali National Park Guide to Hiking, Photography & Camping, or search on the Ike Waits.This book has a lot of great suggestions for day and overnight hiking trips. Also, Waits gives lots of practical advice earned from his years of experience. He goes right down to which side of the bus is better to sit on to get pictures while heading into the park and where to sit heading out. I would highly recommend this book, except that the new edition has more of everything that makes this book great."
1,Pas bon,L'étalonnage du produit n'est pas bon. Tu le met à zéro au niveau de la lame et à 22 pouce tu es off de 1/8 comparer un autre mesure. Le produit autocollant est exellent.
3,needs more oomph to the stick,The adhesive on this tape is not very adhesive. Be prepared to help it stick with some other product. But the measurements are accurate...
2,Wrong Tape,"I was needing a couple self-stick tapes for a table saw sled I made. Looking through the choices I thought I was ordering the right one for the job. Wrong. The one I got is 6' long which is 4.4' longer than I wanted. It is also white and I wanted yellow. Not only that but it is just one side (Right to Left). I wanted to send it back but the shipping would cost me about the same price as another tape like it so I am going to have to eat it while I wait for my new kit...I found the ones I wanted and made sure by re-checking everything that is to come in the Jig Self-Stick Tape KIT. Yes, a kit with 3 sets, etc. in the kit for the cost of 2 tapes if you don't buy the kit.When buying make sure you get and review all the specs to make sure that is what you really want or need."
5,Solid and accurate,"The Kreg adhesive tape measure is great for replacing worn out indicators on table saw rip fences, chop saw guides, and the like. It seems durable,is accurate, and has good adhesive. Free shipping made it a great deal, too."
5,Just as described,Used this to stick to the side of a door to measure patient heights as they come into our office. Works perfectly and much less expensive than the medical height measurment tools.
4,Does the job,"I built a long straight edge using aluminum angle and wanted a ruler on it. This worked perfectly. It is nice and flat, easy to read and the adhesive made it simple to attach."
3,Very pretty watch,"A very simple movement watch with a pretty design.I've only had it for three days and have had no problems.2011 Update. Dropped the watch in December and some of the number came lose. The lose numbers fell down into the works and stopped the watch. Called the manufacturer, they will not give me an estimate for fixing the watch. If I ship it to them in NY and give them $20 they will tell me what is wrong with it and what it will cost to fix it."
5,Two Dynamite Movies!,"Two Women is one of my favorite movies. This is when Sophia Loren showed everyone she is not just a beautiful face and awesome Breasts. Her acting is more powerful than most Actresses can do these days. In real life Ms. Loren had lived through the horrors of war, and she had to reopen many of those terrible memories to do this film. And she did. This is a movie you will never forget!Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow was another great movie. not as powerful as Two Women, but great in it's own way. Sophia and Marcello had magic chemistry between them, and this film really shone with it. Ms. Loren showed to the world that she can do many different scenes, like humor which is hard for anyone to do. And her Strip Tease act was hot. This movie will always be part of my collection."
5,My favorite scent- spicy and rich,"I am a fan of few scents because they rarely capture my complex palate. However, I am a huge fan of Carlos Santana's pefume because it has a deep warmth and spicy feminine overtones. I am also a fan of Hugo Boss' Woman which is lighter but still deep and complex. Love this scent! Hope you will too!"
2,Not fitting for Carlos Santana!,"Very sweet, golden & almost beachy scent. Reminds me of JLo Miami Glow and Jovan Black Musk. Dry down is nice, not so sweet, but it doesn't seem to last on my skin. Also, the white florals are too much for me.Carlos honors women as givers of life, on stage, in music & spiritually. This fragrance is not what I would have expected given his history. Then again, I wouldn't have expected 4"" stiletto shoes and frugly pleather handbags either. All of it is inconsistent with his image.Santana fans might be disappointed. I am."
2,Rehash and Fluff,"Just a few years back Mr. Karas wrote Business Plan for the Body, which made a real contribution to the field of physical fitness and weight loss. Following his guidelines, I was able to shed sixty pounds of unwanted fat. Unfortunately this particular book is mostly an abbreviated rehash of Business Plan. It's not that the information provided is bad, it's only that it is an abbreviated repeat of his prior book, but not as well organized nor as cogently presented. Beware any book that doesn't have an index!!"
5,A Different Way of thinking that works!,"This book is a leap of faith for cardio-holics, but the book produces results. Easy to understand, with minimal equipment."
5,Great Workout,I originally was interested in this book for the workout since my current regimen wasn't doing the trick for me anymore. The workout is amazing!! And the diet info is solid.
3,Not For Me,"I gave this book 3 stars simply because it is not the program for me.I love the idea of cardio-free exercise. The book is very interesting throughout as to the science of cardio vs. weight training. I am with the program that far. BTW, that part of the book was very well written.However, I could never follow the eating part of this program. It is sort of low calorie/low fat/low protein/somewhat low carb. I have been living low carb for nearly 6 years. I have lost 86 pounds. To follow this eating plan would be diet suicide for me.I know there are people for whom this program will work very well. I'm just not one of them. That's my problem, not his.So for those people who fall into the category of low everything, this may be for you. For those who live low carb, I have found Fred Hahn's Slow Burn. That will be the program for me, and it may be for you, too.Lastly, for the training part of this program, you have to buy what appears to be a lot of equipment. I wasn't up for that, either."
5,Cardio-Free Diet,"THIS PROGRAM WORKED FOR ME! Jim Karas' book is wonderful! I noticed results in 2 weeks as the book states. I have completed all 8 phases and have 'removed' 20 pounds since March. At first I borrowed the book from the library, and after seeing results, bought a used copy online. The exercises are easy to follow and I was consistent even with business & personal travel during Phase 3. Before starting this program, I was exercising on a ski machine 3 times a week and using light weights with high repetitions with little results. Now I am exercising with much higher weights and have drastically improved my muscle tone & metabolism. I will be 53 next month and feel much younger. Eight years ago I went through the change and slowly added 25 pounds to my petite frame. I did not follow his diet, but rather cut my portions, increased fiber, drank more water, & cut down on white flour and sugars. I will gladly continue this program for the rest of my life! You can do this!!"
4,the cardio free diet,i thought the book was great and am seeing results already in less than a month.
5,Best results ever,"I recently had a baby (14 weeks ago) I was over weight when i started so I really need to get fit but don't have tons and tons of time. I started this program about 3 weeks ago... I have more energy, I am less grumpy and my body is changing ---- I am working out HARD for 30 minutes a day with HEAVY weights and it is really really working... I have lost 15 lbs and inches...Cheers -- good program for those who are committed but don't have hours and hours to spend at the gym..Cheers"
3,So/so...some interesting information but nothing new,"Thankfully NOT one of those miracle ""diet"" books, Jim Karas is a proponent of mixing healthy living and eating. That is the positive - this book has some interesting theory, exercises one can do and an eating plan. So an all-in-one. That's the good.The not so good: having read his other books, there is very little new in here. So absolutely NOT advisable if you've read Flip the Switch, etc. The diet is also very limiting, starting at 1200 calories a day for women. Even without exercising, such a low calorie diet should stimulate weightloss.All in all, it is only OK. Gives the reader several handy tools and templates but this isn't anything new."
2,are you kidding me?,"the concept of a cardio freee diet may work to sell books and put a lot of money in jim karas' pocket, but in reality, it is not the truth. any successful weight loss plan needs cardio in order to burn the maximum amout of fat. you absolutely need to strength train as well. any person who wants to lose weight and keep it off for life needs to approach it with a 3 angle approach. first, cardio, second, strength training and third, eating plan. i have lost 70 pounds and have kept it off for 4 plus years. i was completely sedentary prior and now exercise 6 days a week. i do cardio 6 days and strength train 4 times a week. for anyone to say that you can skip cardio and be in the best shape of your life is just palin irresponsible. like i said, the only one benefitting is jim karas and his wallet!!!!!!!"
1,How sick can you be?,"This book is a moral disgrace. It should have negative stars. It is just another ploy to take advantage of people who have struggled their whole life to lose weight, just to make money. First of all; the title is a mixed metaphor. Since when is cardio part of a diet? His next book will be the protein free exercise plan. Could you legally write a book and claim that aerobic movement is bad or not needed? I would like to see proof that he has ever been a certified trainer or a dietitian otherwise known as a ""Professional."" He trained Diane Swayer, great! Guess what happened to her? That's right folks, she gained all her weight back. Jim, write a book your kids could be proud of instead of worrying about paying there private school tuition."
1,Cardio Free Diet Book Faulty Binding,This brand new book is falling apart. The binding is faulty. The pages are coming apart from the glue on the spine. Who do I complain to?
1,Whats wrong is obvious!!!,"I would give this no stars if i could. I just saw this book profiled on 20/20. I havent read it but let me tell you. The moment a lady who went on Karas' plan said she only ate 1200 calories a day, i knew why this plan ""worked"". You are starving yourself and losing heart health in the process. 1200 is the bare minimum you should consume. I have lost 85 pounds and have done it with mostly cardio, some strength training and i usually consume 1350-1550 cals a day. Dont be fooled by his claims. You'll only cause yourself more health problems down the road."
3,"Good info, as usual, but nothing new...","I am a big fan of Jim Karas, but found this book to be a bit of the ""same old"" information. I thought ""Flip the Switch"" and ""The Business Plan for the Body"" were more comprehensive. I will say, this book is direct and right to the point: if you want to change the shape of your body, you have to weight train. He recommends completely giving up cardio (the reasons seem valid) and for women, sticking to appoximately 1,200 calories per day (for part of the plan). It's pretty basic and the exercises are pretty much the same as those listed in his other books (I like his theories on working the back muscles of the body more than the front). I agree with what he has to say, but finished this book in about two hours and felt a little cheated."
2,"Agree with his theory on exercise, but not diet","Ok, I think he's on to something as far as problems with cardio. However, 1200 calories a day is bordering on starvation, especially when you add muscle-building into the equation. I myself dropped from 195lbs to 165lbs doing 3 days of weight training and 3 days of cardio per week while consuming approximately 1800 calories a day. At 165 pounds, I hit a plateau. I lost another 40 through a combination of interval and weight training while consuming around 2000 calories a day, more on Saturdays when I had a 3 hour workout. I once tried to stick to 1600 calories a day (this was without regular exercise) and after a few days I began waking up in the middle of the night, ravenous. So to set one calorie goal and assume it's right for all women is wrong and potentially dangerous."
2,Just Ok.,"the diet-1200 calories a day forever- is not maintain-able. Most men and women have resting metabolic rates of 1400-2000. That means that the person burns those calories even if they lay in bed all day, as calories are burned from digestion, respiration etc. If a 1200 calorie diet is followed for too long, the body will preserve the fat and slow the metabolic rate. As for the workout..it is vague at best. Bands are ineffective in the long term. Weight training should be done with heavy weights to build muscle, with good form. (even in women) I highly doubt much progress past a few weeks will be possible without adding heavier weights in the form of barbells, dumbells, pullups, squats, etc. Another problem is that the body needs not only strength, but endurance. Cardio is a way that the body develops that endurance. Cardio exercise reduces blood pressure and heart rate, and also helps to regulate insulin."
5,"You will not die on 1,200 calories","For those of you concern about the 1,200 calories. The Mayo Clinic web site recommend If I want to loose weight to start at 1,200 calories. As you loose the weight and keep active you will increase the number of calories. This book will work for anyone who wants to loose and tone his/her body. I am not big on cooking but I am trying and wish there was a better way. I also wish that he had a video or DVD that showed you how to perform the compound exercises, because it is difficult to try and use the book and perform the exercise."
2,Not Enough Detail,"The weight training/exercise portion of this book does not offer enough detail for a beginner. Even though it has pictures, I found myself wondering if I was doing the exercise correctly. On some, I obviously wasn't b/c my back hurt. There is little information on where you should (or shouldn't) feel the tension in your body. The information on why cardio doesn't work was interesting and somewhat helpful. I'm not a dieter but the food section was a bit of a ""duh"". The bottom line is, and this is has been proven over and over and over again - burn more than you eat and you'll lose weight - exercise and eat what nature provides (don't eat processed food). I wouldn't waste my money on this book."
2,Misleading features,"There is no ""line-out"" as it claim on the features. It has only a headphone out jack.NO RF shielding. FM RF interference when close to a FM radioJust get the lower model down or get a higher model up."
4,Cute for the price.,Costume was cute and served it's purpose (one night outfit) and price reasonable. The only problem was that the snaps didn't stay closed well so I was constantly having to resnap the legs.
5,Holloween suit.,"My grandson loved this. He used it to play in long after Holloweed and was upset when he out grew it.Thanks, MJ"
2,Cute but probably wouldn't buy again or recommend.,The costume was really cute it just didn't fit like an 18 month old outfit should. Fit more like a 12 month only. 2 buttons broke the first time we unbuttoned it so our son had gaps in the outfit.
1,Warning!,"I purchased this costume in September 2006. I immediately returned this costume the next day. It is now January 2007, and I have yet to be refunded nor get any acknowledgement from the company. If you decide to purchase this costume, make sure it's for KEEPS because you will never get your money back from these people!"
3,Browse with Chinese,"I bought this book many years after the other two. You need other kinds of books together with it, because it is not systematic but if you browse in it you find a lot of information: I use it together with WHAT CHARACTER IS THAT? by Ping-gam Go and with a small grammar. Progress is faster than one could imagine."
1,Piece of Crap,"this is a piece of crap...first the handle on the top that you use to turn the blade broke, but the worst thing is: the silver coating(whatever it is) on the blades was worn off by the metal screen and it began grinding the plastic so that you have little black pieces of plastic mixed in with whatever you're grinding. Don't buy this and if you did, stop using it!"
1,this sucks,"The grinder is small and poorly built, and not what I ordered. I ordered a full size spice grinder and actually only wanted a center screen for a Deering spice grinder. The item was misrepresented and I am not happy with the grinder nor will I EVER buy anything from that company again. VERY DISAPPOINTED !!!!!"
2,Mislead,Product was falsely advertised as large grinder when actually was small.Handle has already broken. Sadly disappointed
3,suitable for students in grade 10-12 BUT NOT FOR ME,"The content in this book is suitable only for beginners. If u think that u are quite familiar with recreational mathematic, this book is quite tedious and have no new topic."
3,"I love the movie, but was upset about the copy that was sent","I wanted to have a copy of this movie for my son to watch. When I got the one I ordered, it was not playable on our computer or dvd player. It was UK formatted. :P I wish that had been obvious at the time."
3,Okay Movie.,"It wouldn't play, but they were good about refunding my money so that I could purchase a new one which worked great. Thanks for the good work."
4,One of the funniest Disney films ever.,"It may not be worthy of Masterpiece status, but The Emporer's New Groove will always be remembered as the funny Disney film. It is very alike Saturday Night Live in the way the humor plays out. The voices are great, as well as the animation. See it. I highly reccomend it."
3,Entertaining,"A coming of age animation that almost makes it. It is entertaining, but far from being a classic. There are some funny lines, and a few plot twists, but mostly it is one the predictable side and a bit contrived. A mild recommendation."
3,WHAT A BORING COLLECTORS DVD!,"I like this movie do not get me wrong! I think it is very funny and is great but come on Disney! WHO ARE THOSE 2 BORING GUYS IN THE COLLECTORS EDITION? HOW BORING ARE THEY? I had to turn it off because they are a waste of time! They try to be funny when they are not at all! The mess up the whole Collectors Edition! If you try to make jokes, at least let them be funny! Not so boring and corny that you want to brake your DVD! Sorry, I just did not like them, even though they meant well! It was very boring! They should have been in just one part of the DVD not the whole thing, so I could have not turned them on! THEY WOULD STAY OFF LOL! That is why this movie gets 3 Stars because they are so boring!THANX! :)"
5,Hilarious!,"This movie is incredibly sarcastic, which means the casting people were right on when they picked David Spade. My friends and I went around quoting this movie for days! Pacha is a wonderful role model as the mature and caring family man, and Kuzco is, well, the opposite. Kronk is by far the most entertaining though. Is it really so surprising that this man can have a complete lack of common sense, but speaks fluent squirrel? Most of the jokes will be over the heads of young children, and the most appreciative audience might actually be teenagers, who are old enough to catch what is being lampooned. This will not matter to young children though, because they will focus on the main plot. This is also true of the Muppet and Sesame Street movies, and so I would put The Emperor's New Groove in the same humor category. It makes me sad that Disney is no longer making the musicals it used to specialize in, but I like this joke-a-second format too!"
2,Buy the standard version,"The movie itself is fine, but the additional DVD is pretty worthless. First, it takes forever to load on the DVD player, and the material itself is really rather boring. The documentary they made concerning the development of the movie is awfully boring and of low quality. I regret having wasted the addition few bucks buying a ""Special Edition"" that isn't in fact all that special."
3,Not as good as expected.,"It was an okay movie. Some funny moments. But with David Spade and John Goodman in it, I just thought it would have been better. It is a good kids movie - I guess it was the adult in me that was disappointed. Usually these movies appeal to both kids and adults. This one didn't do that. My kids don't ask to watch it too often either. Maybe they didn't like it as much as I thought either!? Rent it.1smileycat :-)"
5,Clever kids movie fun for adults too.,"This is a story of a selfish young emperor who is transformed into a Lama by his recently-fired assistant, Yzma, and her henchman-hulk Kronk. He accidently gets rescued by the ""folksy-peasant type"", Pacha, who is a good hearted family man and the unwitting participant in the whole episode. Lots of subtle quips and tongue in cheek humor for adults to catch. Great voice talent. Lot's of range of expression. Quick pace, snappy dialoge, memorable scenes. My nine year old has the entire movie memorized."
4,"Great film, but preschool parents beware......","The message is a good one. Basically be kind, or Karma will catch up with you, the golden rule, etc. To any mature mind, this is easy to spot. However, for the younger audiences, preschool and under, this may need some explaining. Emperor Kuzco is only nice for the last few minutes of the film and never really says that he learned from his mistakes or that his poor treatment of others was wrong (unless he is tricking them). Parents of little ones may need to add their own narration while watching the movie to help insure that preschoolers don't just assume Kuzco's rude behavior is cool (like mine did). Overall, this is an extreamly enjoyable film. I highly recomend it. It is funny enough to watch over and over with your child. Just be sure they understand the theme."
5,THE FUNNIES MOVIE (BESIDES SHREK),"This movie is really cool and funny. Unlike many movies, this has no soppy, mushy parts, just downright comedy, with a beautiful plot!"
5,Funniest movie,The Emperor's New Groove is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. My family and I have seen this movie so many times and it never loses it appeal. Kronk is one of the funniest characters and Yzma is a very close second. If you have not ever seen this movie you are really missing out on a hilarious experience.
5,One of Disney's hidden classic,Disney knows what they are doing. Taking on a comidy in this great movie featuring David Spade and Patrick Warburton who are two quality actors. Don't let this movie get passed you. Great fun for all ages.
5,Lots of fun,"I like this movie so much, it's very funny, the Yzma character makes me laugh a lot throughout the movie not to mention when she turns into a cat at the end, also the emperor is very funny when he turns into a llama. I definitely recommend this movie if you wanna have a fun time, it's a great family movie."
4,Hilarious...,It's hilarious all throughout the movie. It bases on lifes features. How man's nature really is toward having so much ambition and temptation to have more. But there are situations where life cycles around and changes the perspective of man. Ovearll it is a recommendable movie for the whole family. It will keep you laughing until the end.
4,It was good,"I live in Ecuador, so I watched this video in Spanish. So I'm sure I missed many of the jokes that are in English and cant be translated very well. But I still liked this movie, it was cute, funny, and had really cool characters. I take it from the llamas and some other things that this movie takes place in Incan South America. I've never seen a disney cartoon take place in SA before. I still think that Mulan was a better movie than this, but it's definately worth watching."
4,Good Film Excellent delivery service,"My son (aged 5)really enjoyed the film and wants to watch it over and over,the transfer is excellent. The humour in the film is really aim at the adults in the audience, as children won't understand a lot of it. The extras are great for the children GREAT disk up to Disney's usual standard.Just a Quick note on Amazon's Delivery service EXCELLENT!!! I recieved the film on the day of release even though I live in the UK"
5,Great movie!,My two daughters loved this movie!! They laughed so much! Really glad I bought it! They especially loved the part when the Emperor becomes a llama!
1,Respect,It's incredible to see such a mistake. I want to think of it as a mistake and not of a lack of interest in history. All the story happens in the Andes and all the names are Quechua (pacha) or peruvian cities (cuzco). But there are several parts of the movie that they mix the peruvian history with the mexican history. You can also hear mexican music and mexican accent in the way they talk. As a peruvian I felt very disappointed when I saw this movie. We latin-american countries are not all the same. Peru is very different from Mexico and they have to respect the history of each country.
1,very disappointing,"Unlike the other reviewers I do not like this Disney film as the main character is not someone you can indentify yourself with. In my opinion the love of the public for the main figure (Pocahontas, Tarzan, Aladdin, Belle, Simba, Nemo, Dorey, etc.) always is the key to the success of the film. In this film I do not have any moment I feel pity of the character or do I really get into the story. Like Lilo and Stitch this is a film very unlike Disney and in my opinion worth to be forgotten very soon."
5,underrated fun disney movie,"I was really surprised when i watched this movie. I laughed for the whole entire time. Truly a funny movie, but it seemed almost more warner bros-ish than disney. It never had one of those ""heart wrenching"" moments Disney always tries to throw in. Lots of fun. As for the SPecial edition DVD. It a great animated menu,tons of sketches, some deleted stuff, and some little toys and games and the such. If you like that sorta stuff, get this version. If you dont care much of that, get the regular, but just watch this movie at any rate."
3,A little disappointing,"Sorry to rain on the parade here, but I have to say this was a disappointment. I felt it lacked the humor, engaging storyline and quality of animation of most previous Disney releases. Not to say that it was bad, just not on par with what I've come to expect from Disney. I bought it blind thinking I couldn't go wrong with Disney and Spade (I'm fans of both). But Spade never hits his stride here. He does a respectable job, but it's by no means vintage Spade. Even my two small children lost interest in the middle on the first viewing. If you've not seen it, I recommend you rent before you buy."
5,Great fun!,"I'm not ashamed to admit that I love this movie! While I always enjoy Disney movies, this one added some adult-focused tidbits that gave it some extra punch. Do you remember Rocky & Bullwinkle? Fractured Fairy Tales? There's a feel of these in Groove that takes it beyond just a kid's movie. The extras on the DVD are also great. The best part? The evil Isme in adorable kitten form. Get this movie whether you have kids or not - why should children have all the fun?"
4,Another Disney Hit,"Disney has another one to add to it's list of hits. The Emperor's New Groove is a fun filled and entertaining movie to watch. It's fun for all ages(pardon the cliche). This is definitely one to add to the collection. So...take my advice and give this movie a look. You won't be sorry. And for you videophiles out there, the DVD has plenty to offer you."
3,LET'S GET SOMETHING STRAIGHT WITH ALL THE OTHER REVIEWS....,"For some unknown reason, people love giving reviews based on the movie in the theatre's and not the DVD. I give this move 3 stars because the dvd is so subpar. The movie is wonderful, don't get me wrong, but the video transfer is absolutely (or damn close anyways) horrible. Pixalation, shoddy picture shots..Disney must have no idea how to make dvd's or something. The extras disk was pretty interesting, but I'm not exactly sure it adds up to $10 extra. It probably goes $5 for the case, $5 for the extra dvd. Overall, I'll go ahead and reccommend the one dvd set but if you have money to waste, go for it. Even then, the one dvd set should be $17. Disney needs a slap on the hand for butchering the video of this great film."
4,Disney without music!,"The Emperor didn't get as much applause as he deserved. David Spade is his usual selfish jerk character--except this time he's animated! John Goodman has basically taken the place of Chris Farley. I think that it's Disney's best since Toy Story. And though they won't make as much of a profit without a soundtrack, I LOVE the fact that there is no music. Finally an animated movie with a script that stands alone!"
3,"Sorta Cute, Sorta Corny, Okay for Kids","The animation looks rushed. The basic idea is good but seems to have been pushed through to completion too fast. It does offer good clean viewing for kids but adults and teens might want something a little more intelligent. This cartoon is okay, but nothing special, although Kronk comes close to stealing the show.Keep in mind, I'm a demanding viewer. You may like it a lot more than I did."
1,1.66 is NOT WIDSCREEN,Some people consider this widescreen. This movie was in the theater at 1.85. This movie is PAN SCANED to the 1.66 aspect ratio. Sure this is better then full screen but it still is not widescreen since it is not how the movie was showen in the theater. For those who don't like widescreen this is not for you either. Since there are still black bars. They are just slightly thiner. Release it in its proper aspect disney.
5,Being this funny should be illegal,"This is not a little kids movie--yes, the tods and tykes will love it, but I showed this movie at my sixteenth birthday party and had college-aged kids holding their sides in pain from laughing so hard.It's Goodman and Spade making jokes the entire time.SO funny. You'll love it."
4,Stupid yet funny,The emperors new groove was stupid. the laughs were all about stupid things. But for children thats all you need. It kept my 5 year old brother entertain. Only god knows how hard that is.
5,Always worth a watch when you need a laugh,"In our opinion, highly underrated and always good for a laugh. Lots of great quoteable lines (Squeakems, Bring It On .. etc.) and greater characters (Kronk!)."
4,Great movie,"The movie is great of course, but I was a little disappointed in the condition. There was a ring on the cover from a drink that had been placed there and play dough or something on the inside...I understand it is used, but play dough? The movie works great though!"
5,You will be quoting lines from this one...,"This has got to be our family's favorite new Disney picture. My husband, a working bass player, plays the theme song over and over. My 5-year-old laughs so hard she gets hiccups, which makes it funnier for us, her parents, because we know she isn't getting half of the jokes. And this cast, it is just perfect for this movie. I have lent this movie out to people who have never heard about it and they cannot believe they never heard of it. The artwork is lush, the characters are out of this world, and, believe it or not, the lesson sinks in. True definition of a sleeper. See for yourself."
3,Emperor's New Groove,I found the story line disjointed and punctuated with irrevalent scenes and jokes. My granson showed interest in only in specific parts and lost interest in others
5,Best. Movie. Ever.,"And I didn't use llama finger quotes when I said that.The movie is hilarious, Warburton and Spade's deliveries are both beyond reproach. Fun for parents and kids alike!"
5,BEWAREEE OF THE GROOVE!,"One of the best movies i have ever seen! I lauged until my sides hurt. It's a great disney movie but is great for everyone. Its one of the only movies i will never ever get sick of! if you like funny, buy this baby!!"
1,"Check your ""DVD Regions""!","Nice DVD, however I would have prefered a big, fat, WARNING written in bright red letters that stated that this disc was for non-US REgions! THis DVD is for playing REgions OUTSIDE of the US!!! What does that mean?? It will not play on any US DvD players!! ugh!"
2,Ho-hum Disney Flick,"The Emperor's New Groove never gets your pulse up. You never care about any of the characters. It would have been ok as a Saturday morning cartoon special, but is unworthy of the title ""Disney Animated Feature."" David Spade stars as an Inca king who is turned into a llama to teach him a lesson on kindness. John Goodman voices his best friend. The villian looks like an anorexic Cruella DeVille with disgusting spidery eyelashes.Endless babbling and anachronistic cultural references made me weary. I was glad when it was over. I know that the destruction of the Inca civilization at the hands of the Spanish conquistadors was one of history's greatest tragedies. But if I were Pizzarro, and the Incas were this annoying, I would have annihilated them, too! I recommend Disney's 2003 ""Brother Bear"" instead, as a wonderful film for both kids and adults."
2,Definitely a kid's movie,"This movie is cute, and kids will like it. Pretty boring for adults though, so I wouldn't really recommend it even as a family movie."
5,Emperor's New Groove,My niece wanted the movie for Christmas. The movie arrived in excellent condition and she loved the movie and plans to watch it again.
5,Emperor's New Groove,I love David Spade in this movie. I laughed through the entire movie. The screwy adventures of the characters reminds me of the Looney Toon cartoons I used to watch. Definitely a thumbs up for this movie!
5,Hilarious Disney movie,"I bought this movie more for me than the kids, it is so funny! David Spade is his usual sarcastic self who learns to grow up and treat people right.I am not a fan of Disney movies like Hunchback of Notre Dame or Hercules, but this a classic."
4,"The Emperor DEFINITELY has a ""New Groove""","This movie is so cool and funny!!! I love Emperor Kuzco and how Kuzco cares abouut himself. It was funny. This movie showed how Kuzco learned how to step outside his own world and get along with other people around him, not being selfish. It's filled with many special features too!"
4,High Praise For This 'Kids' Film,"You've often heard the sales pitch, ""adults will love it, too!"" almost always referring to a kids' movie and in particularly, an animated movie for children. Well, in this case I agree. Even as a middle-aged adult, I enjoyed this.The dialog is adult-friendly but at the same time not coarse or crude with no sexual innuendos, no profanity or even a hint of it. Yet, it's hip with some very clever lines.The story is interesting and offers a few unique twists. David Spade does a fabulous job narrating, has a very pleasing voice, one that's fun to hear. I actually do think adults would like this more than children."
1,ONE STAR FOR THIS POINTLESS RELEASE.....5 STARS FOR THE FILM THOUGH!!!,"No doubt ""the emperor's new groove"" is by far a great entertainer and one of the best animated films to come out of disney studios but do you actually need another edition of the dvd when two different editions are already available? One being a single disc and the other one being a 2disc collector's edition. Again another single disc release for the same film doesnt make any sense to me. Moreover they havent even cut down the price this time or improved on any bonus materials on the disc.I just dont get disney and buena vista's strange ways. They'll keep classics like ""beauty and the beast"", ""snow white"" etc in vaults for years and keep on releasing stuff which is already in stores everywhere.This is not a review of the film ""the emperor's new groove"" which definitely deserves 5 stars in any case!!"
1,Needless and Unnecessary Release!,"I am upset about the ""New Groove Edtion"" of The Emperor's New Groove DVD release.This is for the most part the same DVD as the previous released.Down to the content and even the menus.The only thing really new is 2 more deleted scenes.I thought I would get an upgraded release of the film (hinst the name ""New Groove Edition"")However it is the same old same old.I am totally upset about this situation.I can not return DVD's to the store because the DVD is opened.The only way I could know this was not what I wanted was to open the DVD.As a customer what do you do when the stores have a no return policy on open DVD's.Total Disappointment!Also Beware of the new ""Special Edition"" of Tarzan for it is not a 2-Disc DVD as advertised on trailer previews."
5,The Emperor's New Groove,"The phrase, ""Don't judge a book by its cover"" is one of the many phrases shown in this movie. Once arrogant teenaged emperor Kuzco is turned into a llama by his ex-advisor's botched plan, it really doesn't make that much difference. Then, with the help of a village leader, Pacha, Kuzco (although not at first) eventually realises his mistakes.(A few of these mistakes being firing someone because they're ugly, trying to build a water park on a village, leaving someone hanging to their death AND being extrememly self-centered).This DVD is also packed with bonus features, and two discs, which can make hours of fun watching."
5,Really funny!,"Most people said that this released is trash, pointless and bla.. bla.. bla... I disagree! It's not like other Disney released before but the movie is really funny. That's the reason why I gave 5 stars for this movie and to buyers out there who still do not have and want to buy this, try to get this ultimate collector's edition. Trust me you won't dissapointed."
5,Incredible Movie,"I know that its ""just a cartoon"" but it was made so well. The comedy in it is great. It is one of my husbands favorite movies and we watch it all the time. Wether for a child or child at heart this is an excellent movie. I really recomend that you see it!"
5,Absolutely Hysterical!,"This short but funny Disney film slipped through the cracks in 2000, but anyone who's a fan of Tex Avery or Chuck Jones must see this work. For the first (and possibly last?) time, Disney leaves behind its gentle style of humor and its cloying musicals for a trip to a zany world where the hero is not all that nice, where the villain's henchman steals the show by being just plain goofy, and where slapstick rules the day. Great voice work all around, from the usually dim David Spade to the always funny Patrick Warburton, make this film that much better. And dig the theme, written by Sting and sung by Tom Jones."
5,Great CD but DVD does not play in Region 1,This is a great collection of Suzanne's work but please be aware that the DVD will not play in Region 1 (USA). This is do to restrictions enacted to prevent pirating.
5,Perfect,"I bought the one disc best of and hated it because there was too much missing. This two disc has everything I'd ever want and need by Suzanne Vega... The only two albums of hers I have are 99.9 and 9 Objects of Desire. They are so different form her usual folk fare, but i had to have this best of for ""Left of Center"", ""Marlene on the Wall"", ""Tom's Diner"" and a few others. But I like the stuff I've never heard before.Ms. Vega's voice IS an acquired taste; it's flat, but the right arrangements can make up for that... like Mitchell Froom's two production jobs on 99.9 and 9 Objects.If you are new to Suzanne Vega, this is the best place to start... and maybe all the SV you'll ever need.ANDMy DVD plays! It IS an import but they made an NTSC version as well as PAL. I got lucky; I bought this for the cds, never planning to be able to watch the DVD, but I stuck it in my player, and son of a gun! videos!"
4,Changing my review from 1 to 4,"After a prolonged wait for this product, it arrived in good shape. I had previously been quite dissatisfied yet must say that the customer service and service recovery was very impressive."
1,Good but arrived chipped,"I actually do not hate it, just it arrived broken, it had a big chip out of the rim. I will look for another one similar but directly in a store as this item is not sturdy enough for the mail."
5,real butter not fake spreads,"When looking for a natural alternative to the unhealthy butter like spreads it dawned on me, ""what's more like butter than butter?"" And of course butter is a natural product nothing added except maybe salt. I searched for a crock or butter bell and the Norpro had a basic design and a low price. I used my Cricut and some vinyl to embellish the exterior. It holds one whole stick (1/2 cup) of butter at a time. I live in Georgia and was worried about the warm air melting it. The butter does stay soft and has fallen out once or twice but I'm not sure if that was environmental or User error.We also learned not to put new butter on top of old butter - we got mold. I have seen mold in the water but change it every few days and started using one drop ofNutribiotic - Gse Liquid Concentrate, 2 fl oz liquidevery time I change the water. We no longer have any mold and can spread fresh butter on any bread without lousy hydrogenated substitutes! My heart valves thank you Norpro."
3,functional but poor craftmanship,"This butter keeper is inexpensive and functional, and certainly holds plenty of butter (holds an entire stick) but the workmanship is really poor and it arrived with pits and uneven glazing on the top and as noted in other reviews the top does not fit the base well. So buy it for functionality, but not if you want it to be pretty."
5,Butter Keeper---Great Item,"This is a great item. It looks good in the kitchen and does exactly what it's designed to do...keep butter soft and readily available. I discovered though that you need to keep it away from the heat source otherwise the butter will get mold on it. The further away the better. i bought one for my Mom too, and she loves it.Great item at a great price...."
2,Disappointed,"I had been wanting one of these butter keepers for a while. It had been on my wish list from last Christmas and I finally just bought it for myself. I was disappointed as soon as I saw it. You fill the bottom with water and put the butter in the top. The butter kept falling out and ending up floating in the water. It only held a small amount of butter. It's now taking up space in one of the cabinets.On the positive side, I received it very quickly after ordering."
3,Great when it works,"The idea of containing a glob of butter upside-down over a small pool of water might just be considered a design flaw here, as the butter glob is prone to falling out of the upside-down bell housing and into the small pool of water whenever it gets hot in the house. This is very annoying. But other than that, this weird little trinket of a butter keeper seems to work awfully well, and is preferable to keeping butter on a conventional butter dish, where it just gets melty and generally useless when it gets hot."
1,Great Concept For Yankees,"I loved the concept as I love soft, spreadable butter on toast and other breads, but if you live in a Southern climate, think twice about this product. The heat on a typical Spring day in Louisiana renders the butter so soft that it drops out of the bell into the water. I've wasted enough good butter. I ended up throwing it out."
1,It's a crock! Not the solution to soft butter problem,"I had high hopes for this to solve my sweetie's need for room-temperature butter for his bread. His daughter uses one successfully, he said. Maybe so. We tried several times, followed instructions and video to the letter, used pure double-filtered water and grass-fed cow butter. What they don't tell you: when soft, butter doesn't stay in the upside-down crock, it slides into the water. Well, that might be OK, just fishing lumps out of fluid for a while. But then the surfaces that were buttery and not underwater started getting moldy. Mold might be good on bleu cheese but, this crock is now a tiny flowerpot."
2,Butter flops,"I bought 3 of these, two as gifts. Everyone finally came together and admitted that the butter falls into the bottom where a bit of cold water sits. None of us cares for wet butter on toast.Thought maybe using an ice cube would encourage the butter to defy gravity and stay in place, but was not to be, butter flopped anyway."
5,Good product,"Holds a whole stick of butter. Love the fact, that it is porcelain. Our ceramic one did not last too long. Shipment arrived on time. Tracking of the order was not really possible"
5,Like Buttah,High quality porcelain. Performs as advertised. Several guests have asked about the product and will likely purchase based upon favorable experience.
2,Read the other reviews carefully!,"The message you should be getting here is ""sometimes the butter slides out"" but its no big deal. Digging the butter out of the water in the crock and pressing it back into the cup is NOT why I bought the thing. I say that qualifies as ""doesn't work well""."
3,Ok purchase,"Its very cute and does fit an entire stick of butter...however, I cant seem to get any water at all in there without ending up with wet butter...1/3 of a cup soaked the butter. I store the butter in there without the water, which entirely defeats the purpose of buying this to begin with. The only plus side is that it looks nicer sitting on the counter than the plate of butter that we used to have."
1,Butter,Never used this product. Both I ordered were packaged poorly & were shattered upon arrival. That is the reason i gave it this rating
2,butter dish,"not what I expected, it doesn't live up to what is written about it. the butter falls into the water, and you have to change the water every day, especially if you live in a hot climate"
4,Better butter,bought these to go in my homemade goody Christmas baskets because my hubby and I made homemade butter. Great price and I use one myself. Would recommend
3,Good and an easy read,"Got this book for class, and it appears to be a good overview of the general history of the British Isles... although that ""BCE/CE"" nonsense as a dating system drives me crazy."
5,Love it!,"I have had this machine for over 2 years. I use it at least once almost everyday and never have any trouble with it. The water tank is easy to remove and clean. The frothing wand is also easy to remove and clean. You do have to use small espresso cups because there is not a lot of room between the top and bottom to fit a large container, but not really a big deal. I like that the milk frother is off to the side. I thought the control for the frother looked a little fragile when I got it, but so far so good and no troubles there. Overall, I am very pleased and would definately recommend this to my friends!"
3,"Lush, moody, and delicate","Barbra's second Christmas album is very lush and restrained (for her) but a little bland. Its very ballad heavy which is less problematic than the generic approach she takes on so many of the songs. ""I'll Be Home for Christmas"" is gorgeous except for the obviously synthesized, cheesball ""harmonica solo."" ""Misletoe"" is beautifully nuanced, Barbra's biggest strength. ""Ave Maria"" is ab it much despite her harmonizing with herself and the epic strings. The rest is pleasant, slow or midtempo material. David Foster's ""Grown-Up Christmas List"" is the only mediocre song (the rest are msotly durable classics) with a predictalbe melody and insipid lyrics. Nice, but her first Xmas album is more engaging."
2,Straining Streisand,"I found this album at best Borderline Boring; which is my interpretation of an album trying it's best, but failing to achieve much.It's like All Filler - nothing really to sink your teeth into, nothing that really stands out.And it's a shame too, because I know Barbra is a good articulator of syllables and pronunciations. Barbra knows how to pronounce a word. As she takes her times fully ennounciating each syllable- even common pronouns and conjunctions are given star treatment as they find themselves being expelled by Barbra's thick and pasty lips.I'm sorry I really cannot recommend this album. It falls short on every aspect. But I'm sure if you look around you'll find some other great Christmas albums for the holidays."
2,Longing for Christmas Melodies.... not Mem'ries.,"There is no doubt that Streisand is the greatest singer of our time, yet I also found this CD disappointing. If you don't think of it as a Christmas CD, it is an okay album, with moments of STreisand magic. But, billed as a Christmas CD, it is not what you would expect. It desperately needs an upbeat song, Christmas bells, or even the purity of her voice in songs like Silent Night from her earlier Xmas album. My kids have woken Christmas morning to her Christmas album for years. I guess we'll use this one to get them to sleep Christmas eve."
1,Streisand's Christmas Memories,"One cannot deny that Ms. Streisand has been gifted with a very beautiful voice and her song renditions are almost always supherb, but really, what does this woman know about Christmas or the spirit of the season or any traditional spiritual celebration in light of her corny political views and her support of corupt politicians and their evil policies? I would be curious to know what goes through her mind when she sings the Ave Maria? Probably the adulation and the power of influence her little talent has over so many. I think this CD is as much a joke as her ""Higher Ground"" CD and it's dedication. Sorry, but I can't get passed the hypocrisy!"
2,What a disappointment!,"This is the first negative review I've ever written for Barbra. While her talent, of course, is still intact, the selections with exception to a couple are some of the lamest excuses for Christmas songs I've heard in a long time, and certainly not up to her standards.Stick with her old, original Christmas Amble. Wish I had."
4,A Streisand Christmas with Mixed Results,"Based on the recommendation of a friend, I hurriedly purchased Barbara's latest release. Being a lifelong fan of ""the voice,"" I anticipated a musical treat as only Streisand could do.However, I was somewhat disappointed because this album is 4/5 up to what her listeners expect. Of the twelve songs featured, four just don't cut it. The songs in question can be easily identified because they are the ""newer"" ones.An artist of Streisand's caliber is capable of 100%. I don't think that she would settle for less.But, because it is Streisand, it is still worth the money and the time."
5,Essential Streisand,"Its been a long time since her first x'mas themed recording. Since then, her voice and singing style have mellowed and matured, with a richer lower register. But the yearning in her voice is still very much there and still exquisitely devastating to listen to after all these years."
5,Classic,"Her best studio album since ""The Broadway Album."" Streisand's singing on her past two albums has taken on a darker tone, but no less passionate and thrilling, yet the material wasn't always up to the par of singing. Here, the songs suit the singer, and there's nothing like it when that singer is Streisand. The arrangements are gorgeous, and the singing has an immediacy that makes the emotion even more powerful. She also not afraid to expose the occassional cracks in her delivery, which only add to the sincerity of the performances. The album's masterpiece is ""I Remember"" which is a tour-de-force of song/actress/singer. So many other highlights: ""Snowbound,"" ""What Are You Doing New Year's Eve,"" ""Ave Maria,"" ""I'll Be Home for Christmas,"" ""Grown Up Christmas List,"" ""One God."" I suspect that this will be one of the biggest albums of her career, and deservedly so. Say what you will, but there is no better singer in pop music alive today."
2,A disappointment,"I was very excited to see that Babs was releasing a new Christmas CD since her first one is one of my all-time favorite Christmas albums. However, this new one is uninspired and dull with little Christmas feel to it. Each time I played it, I found my attention drifting off. Compared to the brilliant Linda Eder Christmas CD full of beautiful renditions of traditional and new songs, Barbra's comes off lacking in every way. Sorry, I really wanted to love it."
2,Great voice but boring songs,I love Barbra's voice so much I bought this cd without sampling it first. I have to admit that if I had listened to it first I probably would not have bought it. All of the songs have the same general tone. They are all very soft and melodic with lots of orchestration. There aren't any peppy songs to break the mood. It's too bad she didn't experiment more. Listening to a song or two is fine but listening to the whole album makes me bored.
5,Classic Christmas,"Barbra Streisand's newest Christmas album CHRISTMAS MEMORIES is a must have. Never has she sounded this good. The production is top notch. Her voice is pristine and focused on the material. She has chosen some truly memorable music that fans of Streisand are sure to love. She sings many classics such as ""I'll Be Home For Christmas"", ""It Must Have Been The Mistletoe"", ""What Are You Doing New Years Eve"" and more. As well we have new songs that are bound to become classics, like ""Closer"", a beautiful song about missing someone who is not with you at Christmas. Her rendition of ""Ave Maria"" is nothing short of amazing"", and the closing ""One God"" is another beautiful track. Barbra truly shines on this album, so get this album, sit by the fire with some popcorn and wine, and just enjoy the beauty of this music as it fills your heart with Christmas joy."
5,A Christmas CD for lovers!,"Imagine a snow-covered world outside, a huge fire in the fireplace, being with the one you love and listening to Barbra's new Christmas CD. Barbra's voice, on this CD, is beautiful, mellow and top form. I am so glad that I bought it before I read some of the reviews at this site. THIS IS NOT A PARTY CD. If Christmas music can be termed romantic - then this is it. There is not a bad selection on the entire CD. This will be a Christmas favorite of mine from now on. BUY IT."
2,Bizarre Mix of Mismatches,"It's not that it's a Christmas album of extended proportions as compared to previously unreleased works. This one misses the mark. CAught on the tide somewhere betwen pre-existence works or un marshalled evidences elsewhere, this is an album that knows not where it's going, instead it curts along a line that is both within or without; much ado here. make no mistake, other artists have read the lines before. there is talk of celine dion here, for her coverage of these previously released material on both barbra's path. incongruently it foretells an image of conflict of both artists readings of the songs here.with dion being the victor , well sure enough having the more powerful set of pipes to do the songs justice."
2,Christmas Miseries,"I'm an avid Streisand fan,but am very,very disappointed with this much anticipated and long awaited CD.This is the most depressing Christmas CD ever.Though,Shubert's Ave Maria is beautiful (the best track,by far)the other selections are so boring and gloomy,the listener will long to not only stay home for Christmas,but won't get out of the bed either!Maybe it's being dedicated to Donna Karan's late husband set the mood for the whole CD.What a waste of time and talent.Give me something more cheery.PLEASE!!!!!"
3,Christmas Memories shouldn't be this dull!,"I was looking forward to hearing this album, as it seemed to have a good selection of songs. I'm a sucker for xmas music and I loved her first holiday recording. I was disappointed though, and have only listened to the CD once. As Babs has gotten older, she's also gotten boring. Too much of her legendary perfectionism (and over-arranging) has wrung any passion or excitement out of her vocals. This would be better titled Christmas Elevator Memories."
4,Buy Barbra's XMAS Albums -- Both Part 1 and Part 2,"There is absolutely nothing wrong with this album. In fact parts of it are simply beautiful . (Listen to ""A Christmas Love Song"" and ""I'll Be Home For Christmas,"" and ""I Remember"" especially). But, in my humble opinion, this album, as lovely as it is, is no match for Babs's first Christmas album, released in 1967. That album is just the perfect blend of traditional songs (""The Christmas Song,"" ""Jingle Bells"" ""Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas"") and a little less familiar stuff (""The Best Gift"" ""I Wonder as I Wander""). And I think Barbra does one of the best renditions of ""Silent Night"" that I've ever heard, by far. So I say you can't get this new album unless you purchase the older one as well. They are kind of must-have companion pieces. Happy Holidays and Happy Listening.P.S. There is a version of ""Silent Night"" on Barbra's ""A Happening In Central Park"" cd that is really worth hearing, too."
4,Not for the melancholic....,"This Christmas album is not intended for the melancholic people spending Christmas all by themselves...This CD somehow resonantes the condition of our world...We wanted to be happy and celebrate the occassion, but the losses and tragedy that we are facing somehow hinders us from really enjoying the season. Its best that this CD be played while doing the dinner et al, where the attention is on the food, just as a soft background music or while everyone is chit-chatting... not when you're alone.This CD is a classic Streisand. She's not proving anything new, she always has this talent to select great music for her CD and the wonderful accompaniment. Her voice is like an unnamed instrument that carries itself..its original,unique and unmatched. Her voice expresses itself, including emotions which is very rare now from singers who just often belts out high notes, screaming and squeeking."
2,Not Very Festive,"After listening to this CD I soon realized that it was NOT very good. The songs sounded downright dull and only a handful were traditional songs! Barbra's songs were too slow, and each one sounded like the previous, I normally enjoy listening to Barbra's music, but this is one CD that i feel I wasted my money on, and I wish I hadn't bought it. PLEASE! listen to these excerpts before buying this CD, because I don't want you to waste your money too."
4,New Songs Shine in new Album,"La Streisand has given us a new collection of Christmas/seasonal songs that include several new compositions and fresh looks at others. She is her most impassioned on ""Grown Up Christmas List"" and ""One God."" She really lets it loose. And only Barbra could Stephen Sondheim to re-examine ""I Remember"" and add an additional Christmas verse. Aside from her usual golden tones, the new/less familiar material on the album is what makes it worth getting. It is a bit ballad heavy. One wishes for more of the sense of fun and spontaneity from her earlier albums or at least an up tempo song or two. Every note is perfectly placed and the orchestrations are lush and appropriate. It is a very nice album that will be a welcome additional to any holiday collection and hopefully put some of the new songs into the ""holiday standard"" category."
5,Streisand's CHRISTMAS MEMORIES makes the holiday brighter!!,"I bought this album hoping it would contain new christmas songs, rather than the same old songs done a million times by other artists. Well, this album does not disappoint. There is only 2 songs that fit into this category. The rest are new original christmas songs. The orchestration in these songs is absolutely top notch, and Barbra's voice has never sounded better. Even though it will take a little time before you can sing along, they have that classic sound and feel, rather than the new generation of christmas songs by artists who turn them into mixes of their top 4o hits. These are songs you want to hear over and over again."
1,This cd is not a good example of the reason for the season,"Help! Help! I need your help in deciding if this is a True Chritmas cd or a bogus cd. To me this is a no-none-sense cd. I'm at a loss of what it's trying to accomlplish. Let's look futher at what this cd is about.Please let's focus on the reason for Christmas. Without question the real purpose for this time of year is to celebrate the birth of Jesus. He is the only reason for our celebration. Without him there would be no celebration. Let's don't get caught up in this non-Christmas hype! We all should know better than being mislead.For a so called Christmas cd to be complete, I think we need to feature the great ballads concerning Jesus. Anything less, is just wasted effort. This cd featured very, very few love songs to the master. It seems like it somehow lost the true focus of Christmas and what it's supposta to stand for.Recommendation: I can not recommend this cd."
3,not the best but still very good,"What are you doing new year'e eve is an example of how wpnderful and warm Barbra's mature singing style is. I do not deny her fading vocal powers and sorry to say it her voice is going, but i prefer her now using less voice and convrying more emption than when she was younger, Not bad for 59"
1,This is not much of a Christmas cd,"If you are a die hard Chritmas hymn fan, this cd will not interest you. This cd offers very little of the true Christmas music that we have come to love.As far a Barbs voice goes, it is great as usual. I am off the opinion that voice alone will not do. There's got to be more to a performance than voice alone. Repertoire in my opinion, is as equally important as voice.If you are looking for beautiful Christmas carols, then this cd is not for you.Recommendation: I would not recommend this cd."

2,too bad she can't sing anymore,"bless her heart, even with all the echo, reverb and overproduction, the flat and thin notes are incredibly evident. i admire rosemary clooney who no longer has much of a range, but can at least still sing honestly. ms. streisand wants us to believe that she can still belt and hit clear, high notes, but hides them with choirs and orchestra so we don't really hear. too bad. she does sondheim well, however. she gets credit for that. maybe she should try a little jazz with a small backup group where she can scat and stay within her now narrow range. that might be more refreshing that her vain attempt to still sell a song on vocal prowess alone."
1,"Wake up, Barbra!","I adore her catalogue of music, but this is the MOST BORING crap she has ever put out! Even she said she finds her music boring! Well, this is not helping any Babs!Bring back the Classical Barbra days!ZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzMichael"
2,Please Be Careful!,"I bought this CD for the holidays last year. I played it for my husband on New Years Eve and he got really upset. I never knew exactly why he went into such a rage, all I know is we had a very bad argument that night and it all started with me putting on this CD. At first he was fine with the first song or two, then he started glancing at the stereo and furrowing his brow. Then there was this part where she sings about cookies baking, and he totally goes nuts. He stands up and starts yelling at me saying ""Who the hell sings about cookies baking?"". His attitude changed immediately and he got into a really bad mood. We continued to argue until he ran out the door and didn't come back for 4 days. To make a long story short, we have now been divorced for 6 months. Thinking about the whole thing still makes me very sad, because I really miss him very much. He never acted like that before and we really were in love. All I can say is be careful who you play this CD for."
4,Bonito para escuchar,"Un C.D. bonito para escuchar al lado de tu novio, junto al fuego o al lado de de la estufa. Tranquilo y con una voz que ya no es la de antes, pero cuidada y amable. Buena orquestacion y de factura como todo lo que ella hace: Impecable. ""closer "" le gusta mucho a mi novio."
3,The diva is recycling herself,"After waitting for the CD for a long period (lost during shipment), I bought a new set of speakers and set down, relaxed and with a ""stupid"" smile on my face, turned on the system and waited for the first sounds. My smile disappeared quite soon from my face. Hey, didn't I hear this before? Isn't it all so expected? Ms. Streisand, what is going on here for the last 12 years, or shall I be more precise and state ""Yentel"" as the turning point? If ""yentel"" was, for me, Streisand at her best, ever since than we see only recycling and comebacks and summery. Her latest album, ""essential"", is only making my point brighter.Don't you have, Ms. Streisand, something new to give us? And hey, I am a fan of yours since my early childhood. Today I am approaching my 40'est birthday and I am very disappointed.Please stop recycling. Stop comebacks. Be yourself.I gave this album 3 stars, as I can't disqualify her, but I hope I was clear enough."
5,New Listener......,"I've never really paid attention to Barbra Streisand in the past. Not that I disliked her music, I was just indifferent. THEN, one day, I heard this cd in my girlfriend's car (I think the track that made me SIT UP was ""I Remember"")....and it just blew me away. What a voice! Great music to cuddle to :)"
3,Not as fun or fulfilling as her first...,"I own both of Babs' Christmas recordings. I've only played this one once, to hear the updated Ave Maria, which is my favorite track from her first Christmas album. This one is a letdown. Don't get it without hearing it first, you'll be glad you saved your money."
2,I've tried hard to like this!!,"Barbra returns with a new Christmas album that I've played over and over as I thought it would grow on me, but unfortunately it's a very bland and forgettable offering. Her voice is great and its produced to perfection (maybe this is part of the problem..it's too perfect!), but the only memorable tracks are ""I Remember"" and ""It Must Have Been The Mistetoe"". The rest of the album is plain boring. Like ""A Love Like Ours"" its another perfect but bland offering. Don't even think of putting this on before it's dark...it's not a cd to cheer everyone as they open their presents.....it may work late at night, with a glass of something in your hand, but ultimately its one that will only appeal to diehard fans. Barbra desperately needs to work with some new producers and arrangers to bring her into this new century."
1,"One Part Wail, Two Parts Shmaltz","This album is over-the-top. Barbra wails through every song in a highly schmaltzy fashion. Listening to this is like being hit over the head with ""emotion"" again and again and again. Nothing ""true"" or real comes through. However, if you love to hear Barbra caterwauling, buy this album!"
2,Christmas Miseries,"I am an avid Streisand fan,so was very disappointed by this muchanticipated and longed for CD.The general mood of the CD is so depressing,that it makes you not only not want to leave home for the holidays but not even bother to get out of bed.Shubert's Ave Maria is the only track worth replaying.It's Barbra at her best.My major complaint is,Where's the cheer? These Christmas memories stir up depressions that usually follow,rather than preceed.It won't be something I'll play while trimming my tree."
2,Soft is what it's all about,"Barbra does what she does best. She sings softly, articulating each syllable, hanging onto it as if it's more important than the meaning itself. I am certain that this album will make great seasonal background music. Unfortunately, with the exception of the last 2 tracks - 'Closer' and 'One God' - there is not much that is memorable here. For those of us who have waited long for this, it may be enough. But it lacks the energy and believability of her first album."
1,What a BORING Christmas album....should only be 1/2 star,My wife is an avid Barbara fan and I bought memoirs for her to have and go along with her original BS Christmas album. We hated this cd so much we shipped it back to the store. Try to hear it before you buy it. BORING!!!
1,Weird,"I don't know if the below story is true or not, but either way that is some sad stuff. Of course, I don't know why he waited until she sang about baking cookies. Granted that's lame, but I would leave somebody the second they put on a Streisand CD.And how the heck does she have ""Christmas"" memories???? Did she take a break from spouting her incredibly ignorant political views to realize that a holiday was going on?As a previous reviewer mentioned, having a Jewish person record a Christmas CD, especially one titled ""Christmas Memories"" just seems a little weird."
1,the logic of this astounds me,"As a lifelong fan of Babs' acting, musical wok, and meat-factory management guide writing, I found this dissapointing. There's a fine line between verbose Machiavellian posturing and the crushed souls of the weak that infest our society, and Barbra Streisand is that line."
2,Celine is better,"I think Barbara's album is borderline average, but really i preferred Celine's new holiday release These Are Special Times. I felt Barbara was at times trying too hard in some of the songs. I didn't like the way she leaves you feeling hungry waiting for that cresendo and glass shattering highs, which just well , never came. It left alot to be desired.Compared with Celine, Barbara pales in comparison. Celine not only satisfies your hunger for powerful notes, but really left you fullfilled with glass-shattering notes as well.While barbara's album was average at best, she should retire now and stop trying to sell albums only based on past reputations."
2,Another Money Maker for Babs...does she even celebrate Xmas?,"I always like my singers to sing from their heart, not just so they can make a bundle from me and not even mean what they sing!Does she even put a Christmas Tree up in her home?I can truly recommend the new Holiday release by another superstar...VIKKI CARR. Vikki sings songs from the heart and soul, and I am sure Vikki puts a Christmas Tree up in her homes and really loves Christmas. I recommend her CD ""Vikki Carr Christmas Album"" to anyone who listens to Barbra...you won't be disappointed and just for the international touch, several of Vikki's selections are bi-lingual.Good luck Babs!!! Glad to read in your PR package that you do give Vikki Carr credit for including several of her songs on your Christmas CD. You are given credit for having GREAT taste!"
4,Good,"These glow in the dark stars and moon were what we expected and our son enjoys them. The moon, due to its size, requires ~ 6-8 stickies on the back of it in order for it to stay on the wall/ceiling. I drilled two small holes in the moon and tacked it to the wall instead of using the stickies."
3,Good enough for a toddler,"It does not glow that much. It's pretty light, come with double-sided tape, easy to install. Good enough for a toddler"
4,Great item,I got these for my daughter. She likes that she can sit in her bed and see the stars now. So far they glow great but time will tell.
5,Goodnight Moon...,"I'd bought my daughter some glow in the dark stars, but we were missing the moon so I purchased this. The moon is nice and big and glows very well. The stars have quite an assortment of sizes, but some of them are extremely small and I wouldn't recommend putting them in a very young child's room as a result. But even with that caveat, it's looks great on her ceiling."
4,Cute but get extra stickum stuff,"I liked these because they were big and bright. They put out a lot of light, not for a very long time, but long enough for my daughter to gaze at while falling asleep. The only problem is that the adhesive they provide is terrible. You'll have to buy some additional double sided tape or poster tack. Just don't buy colored poster tack because you'll be able to see it through the stars and moon."
3,The glow is short lived,"We turn on the bright lights in our daughter's room before bed and let these charge up, but they really don't glow for very long.The tape that comes with them has worked just fine on our painted walls. None of the stars or moon have fallen off, and they seem to stick with no problems. I've even moved them and re-stuck them with the same piece of tape and they haven't fallen off yet.I wish the glow lasted longer, so I'm giving them 3 stars. My daughter enjoys these quite a bit, so I don't regret buying them."
1,DOES NOT STICK - LOSES GLOW AFTER 1 HOUR,"This product comes with a tiny little pouch of putty to adhere the stars and moons to the ceiling. First of all, they do not provide you enough putty. The reason being is that you need more ""than a tiny amount"" as the packaging says because the stuff doesn't stick. After using only 2 tiny pieces of putty per star...it left me with about 7 stars with no putty - wasted. 30 minutes after my daughter goes to bed, she's calling my name because a star has fallen down onto her bed.To make matters worse, after an hour of being in the dark, the glow goes away.DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY! This product is poorly made."
1,Not worth the time or effor,The stars themselves are great. BUt not worth the time to put all the stickers on the back of the stars and moon. To get them all hung and then with in a couple hours they start falling down one by one. Sticky pads are junk!!
3,Don't stick,These don't stick well to ceiling. Moon has fallen twice already. Find other double stick stape and use to hold them up. The tape provided is useless
2,Don't glow for more than 10 minutes,"No matter how long I leave the lights on prior to putting my son to bed, these stars do not glow more than 10 minutes after lights out. Disappointing."
3,Rip the paint off,"It's nice, but the light don't last long. And when you try to take them off to readjust or whatever, it takes the paint off. So make sure you stick them where you want them and when you take them off.... Have paint handy."
3,Average but hardly worthless,"Even for Slave, one of the finest groups in the history of funk, keeping the spirit of classics like ""Just A Touch Of Love"", ""Slide"", and ""Watching You"" alive as years passed became increasingly difficult. This is by no means wretched, but it's pretty mundane, save for the brilliant instrumental ""Barbara Jean Boulevard"" which may well be the single best song of their post-Steve Arrington period."
3,gees-gees review,"i purchased this album,when it was released in 1993.i thought it was pretty good, but it didnt have that old school funk slave use to bring to the table. but if you like slave that funky bass player, mark adams still has some funk left."
2,Low quality Kindle edition,"This is a comment about the form rather than the content of the Kindle edition of this book.With wide blank margins on both sides, no chapter markers, and text that renders poorly, this feels like a badly scanned copy of the book.It's a subpar edition, and it's disappointing that I had to pay $10 for it."
3,"Great zeitgeist, thin science","Hellman has an excellent ability to describe the personalities, the scenes, the zeitgeist, but unfortunately he is not too good in science. He never really gets into the heart of the matter, he never discusses any details, he usually relies on second hand sources, he leaves the story in the air just when starts to get exciting. If you know history of science, this book does not contain anything new or startling. But it is fun reading for the uninitiated."
4,"Good, rather light, informative","More than a ""popular science"" book, GREAT FEUDS IN SCIENCE touches a number of disciplines, including philosophy, religion, politics, and sociology. Hence, this book has a fairly wide, if not universal, scope. While his writing is not what I would call distinguished, Hellman is skilled at cutting corners and providing reasonably accurate portraits of these feuding scientists and thinkers, as well as neat summaries of their hypotheses (and world views, biases, nasty streaks, and the like). This is easy reading; any reasonably intelligent 16-year old will get through the book with no problem, and they'll be better off, more informed, for having done so. So while this book may not be an important source for someone writing a paper for a physics dissertation, it will be helpful for anyone wanting a little more than an encyclopedia entry on why, say, Newton or Darwin, is important. Hellman wisely includes notes and a helpful bibliography for those who want more."
3,SEMI/FULL AUTO ANYONE?,"ok first off this gun took about 3-4 weeks to get here couse it was in customs for 18 days!!!!!! but any way wen i first got it it was just so cool it worked fine. me and my dad shot it and it was on semi auto, but the next day wen i went to fire it it somehow switched over to full auto and its pissing me off becouse nowere in the instruction booklet does it say how to switch it and there is no distinct swith on the gun!!!!!so wen ever i pull the slide back to get it ready to fire it just automatically fire full auto and to make things worse it fire by itself!!! i dont even pull the trigger and off it goes, so..... does anyone know how to fix this????!!!"
4,A Secret Gospel of Mark?,"""The Secret Gospel"" was written by Morton Smith, a professor of ancient history at Columbia University. It tells how, while he was cataloging the contents of the monastery library at Mar Saba south of Jerusalem in 1958, he discovered a copy of a letter of Clement, a second-century saint. The letter describes a secret gospel of Mark which tells of Jesus practicing secret rites. Apparently, this gospel was intended for the spiritually elite. It was not included in the Gospel of Mark in the New Testament.This Gospel is either one of the most important discoveries of the 20th Century or an amazing modern forgery -- presumably by Smith. The evidence is equivocal. Read it and decided for yourself."
4,OK,This backpack it is ok if you don't want to carry a heavy backback plus the computer among other things.
5,Lots of laughs at work!!,"I bought this for Halloween and wore it to work. It only came with one insert to write on...so I bought poster board and made more. I put all kinds of funny stuff on them, but the best was ""Joe the Plumber"". Only because of the election that was coming up. Very comfortable and it fits people over 250 lbs."
1,"set-up menu, terrible","looking forward to some McCartney, went to the set-up menu, although I have the latest in sound and players the set-up menu would not let me go to DTS surround sound. although available the menu kept taking me to dolby stereo, then to main menu if I was lucky. not a good buy. McCarney, Wings fans would be better with something else."
5,The absolute best concert dvd ever!,"Simply, the best music dvd from the greatest artist of all-time. It's warm, intimate & it ROCKS."
2,Ultimately Disappointing,"The concert footage is interspersed with tour footage and backstage footage so you get a song here, two songs there etc, rather than a concert all the way through in one piece. This approach may be refreshing at first but does not lend itself to repeated viewings. Also every daft Yank in the USA appears to have crawled out of the woodwork to make up the audience, which is shown ""getting on down"" at every opportunity. The picture quality is not sharp either, whether this is down to cramming three hours onto the DVD and thereby sacrificing resolution, I'm not sure. Surely Macca's got enough money to have made this a double DVD set for the same price as one. That way he could have had the concert on one disc and the ""rockumentary"" stuff and soundchecks etc on the other."
3,"Paul at his very best, but poor technical quality.","The Music...GREAT! Paul...AT HIS BEST! The shots...VERY GOOD! The show...AWESOME! The quality... Ahem... The quality... not so good. Unfortunately, despite the great songs and music and presence of Paul and his musicians and some other famous cameos, the video quality doesn't make a little justice to what i imagine is the real experience of a Paul's concert: pixelated parts of concert footage(perhaps due to a bad use of DV compressors or encoding). And on the menus section the menus interfaces are confusing and some of them, like the ""Bonus Songs"" section are ""road end"" sections in which to get back to where you were you have to work your way out to the main menu and then try to find your way to were you were... sadly, but poor DVD menu interface.But aside that I found the DVD very exciting and a fitting tribute to Sir Paul's musical career, definitely a milestone!."
2,Concert good - picture and sound quality poor to fair,I thought the Concert was good but the sound (both DTS and Dolby) was poor. The picture looked grainy at times.
1,Paul McCartney's new DVD,No I haven't seen it but I want to know if its in wide-screenformat. I've looked everywhere and can't get an answer. I nowbuy only 16.9 widescreen format. And I will buy anything.
2,"Look What They've Done To My Show, Ma","What great music, and the potential for a terrific concert. Put the surround sound on. Grab a cool one. Put the feet up. Plug the DVD in. And here we go. Hello Goodbye. Great start to the show. 1 minute in, and we are now watching the audience. Good, we're watching the band again. No wait, it's back to the crowd. It's still on the crowd. After an hour, if i didn't know better, i would think i was watching a show on crowds singing Beatle songs. Being a big Paul McCartney fan, i found this DVD very dissappointing. The packaging is terrible, with no song lineup on the cover. No booklet inside. Very little bonus features. The music is good, so this is worth something. But if you buy the CD, you get all the songs (and more) with no talking in between. And a very extensive booklet... Please Paul, bring this out as a true concert video. It seemed like too good of a show to be lost on crowd footage."
3,Thank God I went to the concert--this DVD is a poor replica,"Paul is so talented, the concert was incredible but the DVD of the concert should be of PAUL McCARTNEY--not the audience! I don't know why Paul thought we wanted to see the audience? He had a chance to capture his performance for posterity like ""The Last Waltz"", and yet he chose to treat it as a pop commercial. All of the behind the scenes, fans, etc. could have been put on as special features. This concert deserved more respect than it was given on this DVD. Someone was using ""A Hard Days Night"" as a template--come on, this is not 1964! Music fans are more sophisticated today. Paul McCartney is an original--I just wish he would have put out a DVD celebrating that."
2,Too many shots of the audience,"I am a Beatles fan, and do enjoy McCartney's work. But this DVD as a concert is very disappointing. It is essentially ruined by the infinite shots of audience members ""so in awe"" of this concert. And as it goes on, this feature grates, and grates, and grates ... and when you get to the point where the expected explosions go off in ""Live and Let Die""; and they cut to two people who look live over-enthused contestants on the Price is Right who have just won a car - - thats when I turned it off."
2,Let 's sing....Getting Better...,"1,2,3,...and I admit it's not gettin' better, it's not gettin' better, all the time (it can get more worse!)......if Sir Paul McCartney will keep Mark Haefeli to produce all his concert DVD, should be fired.I agree with all the bad reviews,the editing,the sound quality,it's really disappointing.Well,you can judge a book(DVD) on its cover this time! Means...-thumbs up is for Paul's concert performance. Very Good!-showing the back of Paul is for the DVD production.Whata shame!-and when you see the back cover...Paul seemingly would say..This DVD isn't totally OK....thing more,this dvd should be titled...Paul McCartney, bring Back (in the US) my Money!.. not a good one to have if you're a serious dvd concert collector."
2,"Great Concert, lousy DVD","How could a man of Paul McCartney's stature allow this to happen? The sound and video quality of this DVD are on par with old VHS -- video full of noise and color bleed, sound is flat and strident. I was at the Philly concert and can honestly call it one of the top 3 concert experiences of my life. Paul was mesmerizing. That's what made it so painful to see the concert reduced to B movie quality on this DVD. Paul, please watch Bruce Springsteen's ""Live in NYC"" DVD to see how beautifully a concert DVD can be done. Also see Talking Heads' ""Stop Making Sense"" and ""The Who -- Live at the Royal Albert Hall."" These are examples of great video, audio, and editing. Paul deserved better treatment. The rapid cuts and being pulled out of the concert between every song for behind the scenes really defeated any sense of ""being there."" I can recommend the DVD on the merits of the performance alone. But be forwarned, it ain't pretty."
2,Major disappointment....Paul deserves better.,"The producers of this dvd blew the chance of a lifetime. Thanks a lot. Paul McCartney doing his life's work in a ""live concert"" and you guys chop it to pieces with interviews? What were you thinking? Paul and the band seemed to be in top form and played their hearts out. Who put the video together? It was very jumpy....no frame staying on for more than a second or two. Annoying, stupid and just plain awful! The audio mix was of good quality. Go buy the CD instead. If you want to see how a concert dvd should be presented check out ""Roger Waters In The Flesh"" or ""Elton John One Night Only"" or Bruce Springsteen Live In New York City"" If you just want a documentary on the tour, this dvd is fine but it is labled a ""concert film""....misleading to say the least! Shame!"
3,What Happened?!!!,"I've seen about 90 rock/pop concerts in my lifetime and Paul McCartney's ""Back In The USA"" Tour may have been one of the best. However, this DVD and the associated CD for this concert is less than what I'd expect from someone of McCartney's stature. The DVD is filled with video segments that must have been recorded on analog video cameras or really [bad] digital handicams, and the CD's sound quality on several songs is not nearly up to par with the concert's sound quality. The Producers really [messed up] this one. Sure, there are some really good video and audio qualities here and there, but McCartney and his fans deserved the better quality for the entire length of the recordings. What a shame. Sir Paul put on a first rate concert tour and it will forever be immortalized with this second rate production."
3,A little disappointing,"Unlike the majority of your reviews of this DVD to date, I have actually purchased this DVD and watched it.Sir Paul could take a few lessons on concert DVDs from the likes of Paul Simon or James Taylor (The Pullover Tour). Give us a DVD that captures a live performance without all the gab and comments between songs. Or at least make the DVD have an option so you can just watch the concert footage like they did on the Concert for New York. At least a DVD player allows you to advance through the BS quickly.I did enjoy the actual concert footage very much! The song selection was also good, and the video quality is very good, overall. I found the DTS sound mix to be lacking, the center channel was weak. I think the Dolby 5.1 mix is better.Overall, I just found the DVD to be a little disappointing due to the interuptions between songs that ruined a true live concert experience."
1,Where's the Music?,Poor quality mix with lots of interruptions of the thing you bought the DVD for: The Music! If what you want is a DVD of parts of songs and interviews then this is the disk for you. If you want Paul's incredible music don't waste your time and money.
2,A Distant Second Best From Being There,"As someone who saw the concert, and thought it was the best concert ever, this DVD fails to convey that to the viewers who weren't lucky enough to go. The best part of the DVD was converting it to audio and listening to it in the car, other than that, its not very good."
4,Almost Perfect,"It is a pleasure to see Paul performing with such professionalism. I always thought that Paul had a lot of genius but was not working hard enough to perform afterwards. This album is the opposite, it reminds you that this guy is before all an excellent musician. His band was dynamic and fresh. Great job.On the bad side, all these fillers between each song of the DVD are very annoying and how did they dare to cut half the beginning of Hey Jude with some silly apes footage?!? Nonsense."
4,A Bitter Australian,"I am sorry to say that I think Mr. Garvey from Australia is bitter about the plug being pulled on the Australian arm of Mac's tour. Although there is some truth to some of the things he is saying in his review, some of the criticisms are just plain unfair. Just about every concert video I have ever seen has included much footage of adoring fans. Check out Springsteen, for example. I have been following the concert circuit for many years and I think most of the top performers play the same songs over and over because these are the most requested songs. I think that for every one person who complains about the repetitiveness of the songs, there are three more who spill tears of joy each time they hear these wonderful songs for all of the memories they bring back. I don't know how this person can refer to himself as a Paul McCartney fan. I recommend the DVD highly. It isn't the best ever done, but it is a keeper for the true McCartney fan. -- Susan Nash, Maryland"
2,Neither a concert nor a documentary. Very disappointing.,"All the content is here for a stellar DVD. Awesome songs and performances by Sir Paul and great behind the scenes footage. The quality of the video shot is only OK, though. But, if they wanted to produce a concert video, then why did they keep interrupting the performance with interviews with the band, crew and fans (all of that could have stayed in a separate ""Behind the Scenes"" feature)? If it's a documentary about his Driving tour, then they should have shortened the concert portions and focused on that only. It's frustrating to get into the performance only to be taken ""out of the moment"" by them inserting some interview, sometimes interrupting a song!I'd give the music an ""A,"" the editing a ""D,"" the Audio quality a ""B"" and the video quality a ""C."" But the frustration level makes me rate this overall as a ""D."""
3,Great Little Rockshow,Early reviews are expressing disappointment in the fact that none of the concert footage is complete. This is awful as I was wanting a complete show to relive my experience. I'm glad I have the Anahiem audience video to compliment this dvd. I'm still looking forward to the backstage stuff but would've really appreciated a complete show.
5,Paul at his best!,"I'm so glad they put a DVD together of Paul's last concert tour in the US..I love the behind the scenes stuff and some of the most moving concert moments were his dedications to Lennon & Harrison..Paul's band rocks and one part I love is when he is trading licks with his two guitarists on ""Carry that Weight""...great stuff!!"
2,I used the skip forward button a lot.,"When I buy a concert film, I want to see and hear uninterrupted song performances. Since my DVD player is piped through my stereo, I like to play DVDs as CDs. I don't want the songs to be interrupted with interviews with the crew or (least of all) interrupted with interviews with crying obsessed fans. This DVD has both. There were at least two songs that had people talking over the actual performance. I was so annoyed that after every song I would press the skip forward button to the next song. I would then wait to see if someone was going to talk over the top of the song, if they did, I would skip to the next song. And the footage is of poor quality. It is great music and a great performance I'm sure but I recommend checking out the CD first. I was very disappointed."
2,not as good as I thought it would be,"I did not see the concert. I read the first couple reviews on this here which was good and decided that I would buy it. I poured myself a glass of wine and kicked off the shoes and prepared... and was dissapointed. First of all, the picture quality was not that good which is understandable because some of the photography is in the dark . If this was the only problem, I could live with it but there were other detractor which in my mind were unwarrented which made this DVD a dissapointment. They could have put in more footages of the concert instead of their activities in the zoo, backstage activities and shots of movie stars. I bought the DVD to see the concert, not the other stuff. If I knew what it would be like I would not have bought it. Try to borrow it from a friend. My recommendation is not to buy it."
2,Too many clips - not enough concert,"I would have love to have seen this concert without all the chit-chat, interviews, etc. When they played they were amazing - Paul's voice held up fabulously and his band is outstanding, but it was extremely annoying to have to listen to all the other self-serving filler that should have been relegated to the ""special features"" portion of the dvd. Also, some pretty poor production."
3,Not his best performance......,"I saw this show on TV when it came out, thought I would check out the whole show, well sorry to say Pauls voice aint what it used to be.... besides the fact that we see Jack Nicolson and Tom Cruise and other celebs throughout the film, we see less of Macca and more of his fans. They should have named this DVD ""Fans of Paul MaCartney are back in the US"". When I watch a DVD of a performer ""I WANT TO SEE THE PERFORMER"", not his fans screaming for him. Why was everybody crying during this DVD???? I think there were alot of middle aged people in the audience that were wishing it was the 60`s again. I can understand why, Pauls voice was shot for this show, he cant hit the high notes like he used to. His band was mediocre at best, the sound was horrible, the drummer was good but way too animated in his playing, arms flailing about. Ringo should have sat in on this one.....anyways, nice video if your a huge fan but im not so I could take it or leave it."
5,WONDERFUL!!!,I was soooo excited about this DVD --- I absolutely love it!!He is still REALL good! You MUST buy this DVD! If you really loved the Beatles you have to get this one!!
2,"Lovely performance, lousy DVD","Could you please help me? Am I perhaps the victim of sheer bad luck? Murphy in action? I've been waiting for this DVD for ages, and just when I get it, the physical product is A FAILURE (technically speaking, because artistically it is wonderful). I was able to see just once the second part of the concert. The quality of the product is awful. Has anyone out there suffered the same twist of fate? Is it only poor me? Please let me know. It has been tantalisingly painful to see Paul's wonderful show only once. Must I order a new DVD? I live in a far away corner of the world so it is rather complicated to ask Amazon for a replacement. Opinions, please??????"
5,Try to see it my way,"After seeing Paul McCartney's Tours for Flowers in the Dirt and Off the Ground, I'll say his voice for this tour was the best I've ever heard. Listen to ""Get Back"" & ""Paul is Live"" then listen to this. The songs, stage show,overall effects, the band and his voice haven't been this good since the Wings ""RockShow"" video. Every minute was full of an energy and enthusiasm I thought was lost long ago. If you have a home theater system set it for stadium or arena and crank it!!!"
1,PUT IT THERE...WAYYY OVER THERE!,"Yet another excrutiatingly painful concert film from Macca, except this one's probably his MOST painful. Solid performances by the band are constantly undermined by poor picture quality and prickly backstage cut-aways. Just AWFUL."
1,A Huge Disappointment,"This DVD is a big disappointment. I love the Beatle's and McCartney's music, but this DVD is not about the music, it is a quickly packaged product that shows more footage of the audience than of the performers onstage. Paul seems to have no quality standards, indeed, the songs are incomplete, interupted by interviews, poorly edited, and some are very weak renditions when compared to the original Beatles recordings. The concert is constantly interupted by extraneous footage of Paul riding around in a limo, etc. In a nutshell, I found this DVD to be an unwatchable piece of garbage."
3,wonderful & awful at the same time,"I admit that the performances of All My Lovin' and Hey Jude got me all choked up, but the overabundance of inane non-concertfootage (fan one-liners, crew members congratulating themselves,and even a 'wild kingdom' segment) nearly made me throw up.As an individual who was around when all of those songs werenew, as well as a hard-core Beatle fan, I was truly touchedby each performance. McCartney's vocals were strong, and hecan still hit the high notes. The band did their homework learning the original arrangements. The drummer kicked [...],for sure... The performances were intense. As far as theDVD presentation, it's not up to par in video and soundquality, but it's presentable, nonetheless. My majorproblem with it was the fluff... Even the celebrities inthe audience were listed in the closing credits! Sheesh!!The only thing missing was an opening monologue from Bono.I still say buy it! The music's that good."
3,The film could be made much better.,"First of all, Paul's performance is great, this is not questionned at all. I just regret this DVD didn't let me enjoy the show in full, and without distractions. Because of all this off-stage material, watching this DVD gave me a feeling of a TV show interrupted with commercials every 5 minutes. Song intros and ends are often cut off. The picture quality sometimes is just bad as a lot of shooting was made in the dark. Some really great songs are missing.Why didn't they just show the concert in its entirety, leaving the interviews and fooling around for bonus materials?"

2,A Big Disappointment,"Having seen Paul McCartney in concert in April in Cleveland, I was eager for this DVD and the CD. While the CD is excellent, I am really disappointed with the DVD. My favorite song is ""Hey Jude"", and it was very disconcerting not to have the entire song on the DVD. Instead, after some filler before the song, the song was joined in progress, probably about two minutes into it. While it was great to have the entire song on the CD, I wanted the DVD to show me the entire concert as I had experienced it, not a ""joined in progress"" song!"
3,For the editors,"Editors, Please take a look at these reviews. Every single person has reviewed the concert, not the DVD. This is utterly useless for buying the DVD. Please delete the reviews that do not actually review the DVD. Thank you."
2,Ultimately Disappointing,"The concert footage is interspersed with tour footage and backstage footage so you get a song here, two songs there etc, rather than a concert all the way through in one piece. This approach may be refreshing at first but does not lend itself to repeated viewings. Also every self-proclaimed Beatles nut in the USA appears to have crawled out of the woodwork to make up the audience, which is shown ""getting on down"" at every opportunity. The picture quality is not sharp either, whether this is down to cramming three hours onto the DVD and thereby sacrificing resolution, I'm not sure. Surely Macca's got enough money to have made this a double DVD set for the same price as one. That way he could have had the concert on one disc and the ""rockumentary"" stuff and soundchecks etc on the other."
3,No Apto Para México,pros1.las cancionescontra1.no esperen ver lo que paso en los conciertos de mexico d.f.2.muchas tomas al publico3.cortan la continuidad del concierto con entrevistas malas4.mala calidad para dvd5.mal audio en dolby digital
1,"2 down, 2....","To sum this up: a pathetic piece of self-indulgence on Paul's part and that of his audience, trying to relive the not-so-good 60's - and a rip off to boot!"
2,"Great audio, Video disappointing.","I was looking forward to see this concert video; I have a large collection of concert videos and enjoy watching them. The disc itself has plenty of interviews and special features. Sound is very good, a little heavy in surround but OK, most concert video are mixed that way anyway. My main complaint of the movie is the video. The camera work looks like it was filmed and edited by high school kids, the camera zooms and all the jumping around is horrible, looks like they tried to copy the camera work in ""Law and Order"". ""Live and Let Die"" almost made me sick. Them looks good for ""Blackbird"". The interviews in-between songs are annoying to me, an option in the menu to watch the concert and concert with interviews would have been great. I do agree with most posts here that there are to many crowd shots. Overall not a bad effort but not on par to the best concert videos out there."
1,"Don't Buy This DVD, Buy Wings Over America","When I saw Paul McCartney last may, I could not wait for the concert film. Because I remember ""Paul McCartney Rock Show"" one of the best concert films I have ever seen. The day this dvd came out I went out and picked it up. When I got home that night I pop the dvd into the player and my joy turn to disapointment. What makes a good concert cd or dvd is seeing the interaction between the singer and the crowd."
1,"So you did it again, Paul","I'm a huge fan of the Beatles and Paul. I attended 2002 concert and also watched TV concert film aired before. Reading others' comments for this DVD, I found that the DVD contained the exact same contents with the TV program. If it is the case, DO NOT BUY this DVD. When I watched this concert on TV, I was very much disappointed and turned off after 30 minutes or so. But at that time, I thought it was because it was edited for TV show. How can they sell this ... as a DVD title?? It was not a music film at all. It was a 'poorly made' documentary, at its best. I think Paul is not so interested in making a concert film of a good quality. GET BACK and PAUL IS LIVE VHS were also very bad! I just own them as a sort of full collection of Paul, but do not recommned as a good concert film at all to others. Paul, why are you making the same mistake again and again? Or do you have any calculated commercial intention? Look how great concert DVDs other musicians are making these days!"
5,Remarkable concert,"If you like McCartney or are interested in seeing what he's all about, you can't go wrong here.As with all his other concerts, this performance demonstrates his wide range of talents.There's the obligatory Hey Jude, Let It Be, Live and Let Die, etc... along with enough songs that he'll probably only play once (Hello Goodbye, Lonely Road, Mother Nature's Son, Getting Better, Something,...) to make it worthwhile.Yes, there are plenty of audience shots, but you come to expect this with any concert video.The only ""ouch"" is Freedom, right up there with some of his worst songs.On the other side of the equation, you have Lonely Road - a real sleeper. One of my favorites - I'm surprised it never really caught on.People will look at this concert 100 years from now and say ""wow"".Mind you, same is true for his other concert DVDs."
5,next best thing to going to a live show,"well I saw this tour concert twice in Dallas andSt. Paul. this is the closest thing to seeing theshow, but of course nothing NOTHING beats live Paul.strangely the video seems only 4:3 aspect ratiobut I can deal with that"
3,Great Performance Poor Video Quality!,The DVD performance is exceptional.The quality of the video is poor but the DTS sound is excellent!Rock on Paul!
1,Oh well...,"You know, before going out to buy this DVD, I read the reviews here. But still couldn't decide.Was it a spectalular performance?Was it a total waste of time?After purchasing it, I can say that it comes closer to the latter. Everything you've read about it: the excessive audience shots, the bad lighting, the self promotion, they're all here.Save your money."
3,Fair,"Overall it was good, but I was a little disappointed in the quality of the sound. Was hoping for really top notch quality stereo sound. Cheap tv sound is what I got."
3,The concert was better,"I didn't like the frantic cuts and editing. The DVD doesn't do justice to the amazing spectacle that took place on stage with the band or the 39 monitors behind them.Fortunately, it is true to the songs. And good or bad, Paul delivers the same (amazing) show to everyone. It captures the intesity of the crowds and fans. But, I agree with an earlier review, ""More Paul, Less Boobs"".I liked the behind the scenes stuff. But I wish there was more with each of the musicians."
2,Outstanding Concert...but Poor DVD,"This was the best concert I have ever attended. Unfortunately, the DVD didn't come close to the concert. The picture quality and sound quality were both mediocre at best. I suggest saving your money until they put out a better quality product."
2,Great Musician but...,"I was lucky enough to see McCartney live in May on the first part of Back In The U.S. tour, and I can tell you it is the best concert I have even seen. When I heard that there was going to be a DVD of this tour I could hardly wait for it to come out. Now that its out I wish I had kept my money. The DVD was of poor quality and for the 5.1 surround sound it was very bad. They had voice overs in most of the songs, and when I listen to music I want to hear just the music, no voice overs. If you went to see the concert just savory the memories and don't buy the DVD you will be disappointed."
3,Disappointed!,"I was hoping for a complete, uninterupted concert DVD. This is not it. Songs have been intentionally edited removing guitar solos and verses. I like the ""behind the scenes"" footage, but the scenes should have been included as bonus material. They shouldn't have been cut into the live show.Paul, please redo this and make it the way it should have been done in the first place."
3,Too much Audience,"McCartney and his band sound great, but the latest thing in concert DVDs is to show the audience. Why? An occasional shot would be sufficient. As an occasional concert-goer, I am aware of the impact the crowd makes on the atmosphere of the concert, but that just cannot be duplicated on a DVD. Show the band playing their music. The songs on this are great and the band plays with elan. Recommended music, DVD less than satisfying."
3,"Disappointing Concert ""Film"" Produced Poorly on DVD","I attended one of these shows, and it was one of the greatest concerts I've ever attended. So I fully expected the DVD would be just as expertly produced, but what I saw was one of the worst concert videos (made to look like film) that I've ever seen. All the previous comments about it having image problems are right on the money. It looks like garbage. The editing is amateurish, and the sound is unspectacular. The way the menus are arraigned is inconvenient. Paul was the executive producer on this, and I'm appalled he would release this to the world. The only reason I gave it three stars is the music and the performances reminding me of how it really was when I saw it live."
4,Handy and useful book for the NDS beginner,"This is a small and handy book about NDS the Novell Directory Service. It is fun, fast and easy to read. I found it trustworthy and helpful."
4,Great Resource!,"For anyone studying Greek Sculpture, this is a wonderful resource. The passages are translated in English and also written in Ancient Greek. This is an older book and the only issue that I have with it, is that it does not do a very good job of walking the reader through the history and impact of the words being read."
1,Disapointed,I had great hopes that this would work but it had no effect with my cats. I sprayed it 2 times a day and the cats just ignored it completely I thought that maybe it just works for dogs so I tried it on the bathroom rug where the dog kept pooping well it didn't even effect the dog either. I will have to try another brand.
1,Don't bother....not worth the money,"If I could, I'd rate it no stars, but Amazon doesn't allow that option. I tried to use this to keep my boxer from chewing on our TV cable. I followed the directions, and even sprayed a piece of cloth as recommended. My dog apparently couldn't get enough...she took the piece of cloth and started to play around with it in our backyard. Maybe it's really a dog attractant, and got mislabeled at the plant?"
1,Only Works at First!,"My dogs were initially repelled by this product but eventually got used to it. I applied it daily as per instructions but it totally lost its effectiveness after about one month of using it. A much more effective product for me is ""Off Limits"" which you apply every three days. It totally broke my Shih Tzu's habit of peeing on certain areas of the patio."
4,good product for the money,has worked so far on my min pins; will order again to keep on hand ; I have used other products but this one has been the best.
2,Nothing Special,"I bought this to keep my dog away from a power strip behind our tv and from the garbage in the kitchen. First, this product has a very very strong smell when you first use it. However, it will dissipate and you won't recognize it, but supposedly the dog wills till be able to smell it.Upon first using this product, it worked great. It kept my dog away from areas I didn't want her to go. But after a couple of weeks of use and reapplying, the dog quickly ignored it. I find using something like bitter apple to deter the dog works far better than this product did."
4,Rushdie's most accessible book....,"A primer of Rushdie's writing style, which sometimes is hard to follow because of the dramatic changes of setting and language. This is an enchanting children's story, set in an exotic eastern landscape peopled by magician and talking animals, it's a story of a storyteller. Captivating for a number of reasons, the humour that will make you chuckle, the Swiftian satire that permeates beneath the surface; the beautiful imagery in which Rushdies immerses the readers. It inhabits me with the same imaginative space as Gulliver's Travel and the Arabian Nights"
5,Required Reading for Pleasure,"I had to read this book for a humanities lit class. I found myself really enjoying it. It is a really excellent book. It kind of made me feel like a little kid. It is such a fantasy story, but it isn't written for kids. It was quite inspirational too, it made me feel like everything would be ok. I have recomended this book to two other people, they loved it too. I don't want to tell you any of the plot because it suprises you as you read it, but it is a really good book. One that I would recomend to anyone who asks what to read."
5,"Nice Story, Well written",I have been reading Sulman Rushdie for a while and I can see what makes him so great.His interest in giving out details makes this book and any of his other book an interesting reading.
4,his best,"This book is sort of the Arabian Nights + Princess Bride, with a little Alice in Wonderland thrown into the mix. When Rashid, a storyteller known as the Shah of Blah, loses the ability to tell stories, his son Haroun sets out to find out what has happened. With the help of Iff the Water Genie and a cast of colorful characters he finds out that forces of Darkness are polluting the Sea of Stories.It's all a thinly veiled allegory for Islam trying to silence the author after his Satanic Verses was published, but it's deftly handled & often quite amusing. Rushdie does an especially nice job with word plays & puns & the book requires rereading & reading aloud to catch them all, which makes it a perfect book for adults to read to older kids.GRADE: B"
5,Haroun is Better than Harry,"Don't let the author's name scare you away from this fantastic book. Rushdie brings this fantasy world alive with wonderful description and his artistic use of vocabulary. Full of wonder, suspense and fun! Great book for middle-schoolers (and up) or as a read-aloud to younger children. There are subtle political points addressed in the novel, but children will not notice."
5,Wonderful tale for the ages,"I read this book a while ago, and I fully intend to read this story to my kids as they grow up (when i have some). The book is a great story for kids, but adults will love beautiful imagery of rushdie's words.One of my favorite books of all time."
2,HAROUN AND THE SEA OF STORIES.,"iTS SUITABLE FOR A CHILD, NOT A 72 YEAR OLD SCHOLAR.i AM FINDING IT HARD GOING. faNTASY IS NOT MY THING. i RED ARABIAN NIGHTS AS A CHILD."
2,Long-winded,"This book was an okay book, with plenty of allusions, and probably if you look beneath the surface you will find a lot of meaning in this book. However, on the surface, as a kids book, this book was long-winded and repetitive. It just got boring after a while, and the fact that the story was nothing special did not do a lot to keep the reader engaged in the plot. I understand that Rushdie wrote this for his son; but he seems to get caught up in his own intelligence and go on and on."
2,"good children's book, dumb grown-up book","No where on my copy of this book was it identified as a children's book. (I give Amazon more credit --- there were clues on their web site.) So after Satanic Verses, it was a real let-down."
2,A children's book.,"Don't get me wrong, this is not a bad book as such. It's just that it's a children's book, a fact I did not know before buying it. It's beautifully written and imaginative, and I liked the hidden message and the meaning behind the names, but the fact is I stopped reading fairy tales a VERY long time ago. The book has some moments that managed to hold my interest, but other than that I found myself wanting to finish it so I could start reading something else. I kept reading, hoping that at some point "" the child inside me "" might wake up, but that never happened. Nevertheless, I'm saving the book for my children and I'm sure they are going to like it.Not a waste of time, as it's so short, but next time I'll choose an "" adult"" book from the same author."
2,"Salman, how could you?",I was disappointed. I expected it to be better. More coherent.The book and the audio book!
2,Who likes a nap,"Lets see, in high school i prefer to read something that is real, not a fable from god knows when. I found this to be boring and childish. The first 2 pages say that the city the main character lives in is a sad, sad, sad, sad, sad, sad, sad, sad place with depression factories. That is not a joke or stretch of the imagination either. My suggestion, move along and dont look back, ever."
1,Interesting and fun,"Interesting and fun because there is more to the tale than you first think there is or is there? My first impression was that Haroun is a pre-Pratchett fairystory but in the tradition of Arabian Nights. It is, of course, an oral fantasy, a work of fiction about fiction itself, Rushdie asking what is the point of a story if it isn't true? The point is, as every child will tell you, that fiction makes you feel better because it's fun and also brightens up our complications.In a way there are similarities between Rushdie and I in that we both use our natal country (his being India, mine being Romania) as a vechicle, as roots for the pudding of our fiction."
5,Haroun & the Prose Poem,"Haroun and the Sea of Stories is one of my all time favorite books. I must admit that I am in love with Salmon Rushdi, his lyrical approach to life, his outlandish and charming metaphors, his wonderfully dark humor.Perhaps, my fond memories of this work stem from reading it aloud together with my 10 year old daughter who was also delighted and mesmerized by his skillful images. I have many times compared Salmon Rushdi's droll, at times twisted life-view with that of Roal Dahl. I guess I came here initially to track down Rushdi's newest book, ""The Ground She Walks Upon,"" and couldn't resist putting in my two cents worth regarding this incredible previous work.cc"
5,An absolute Classic,"I found this book years ago in overprints, and after reading it, went back and bought 6 copies for friends - then another 6, and it wasn't enough. I read extensively and widely; if I could keep only one book, this would be it. I've read it a dozen times and keep going back. Like all good fables, it is both charming and profound."
5,Haroun and the Sea of Stories- Best book in the world!,"The best book in the world by the best author, Haroun in the Sea of Stories is written very well. This is a great book. There is something for everyone! Haroun and the sea of stories is No. 1! Read this book now to see what the best book in the world is all about."
2,not a compelling read,"Haroun and the sea of stories....very child like, complex story.....would be better as a graphic novel or a cartoon movie."
5,A beutifuly writen book,I have like most people heard the name 'Salman Rushdie' ans thought of the auther of The Satanic Verses. I never imagend myself reading anything by him. Then I read Haroun and the sea of stories which I simply loved. If you like it read The Never Ending Story by Micheal End. This is one of those books that I cried at the end of beacause it was so sweet. I strongly recomd this book to anyone even childre (9 and up)
