2,so/so,"This carrier was smaller than i thought, cant really fit that much lugggage in it! If you have a stroller that will fit in it, but not much room for anthing else. I recommend buying something larger"
3,Thule 846 Quest Rooftop Cargo Bag,"good afternoon, this purchase did not come to our courier, so I've never been, this has already been debited from my credit card and if I need the product, please i need it released and informed that I was made to tell so to AEROCAV.The request was 9102901001601003045259Thanks,Jean Carlo Rivas"
1,Heat your house with this thing...,"What a waste of my time. I actually threw this book away. I only fished it out of the garbage when I found I could get my money back. The letters aren't real, they aren't even BASED on real letters. Overton ISN'T funny and he's playing off a subject that Mr. Rollins has repeatedly talked about in a negative context - getting badgered by idiotic fans who feel he owes them something. Try Rollins' actual books if you want a good read. ""Letters..."" is overdone, uncreative, and basically a cheap, weasely way to make money. Rot in H-E-double Q, Overton. You're a hack."
3,Nice for the Money,"Color is slightly different than online - lighter than the picture (more like a maple color). Also, the bottom of the umbrella tray is plastic and looks a bit cheap. Otherwise, stand seems pretty sturdy and I like the fact that the coat hangers spin around. Overall, good for the price."
5,I really liked these gloves.,"I really like these gloves. They have nice air holes and they have these velcro things on the side that make them get nice and tight when I ride, and I really like the Gel inside of them."
2,I dispise writing negative reviews; but will when necessary,"I bought this book because of my interest in Shamanism.Bluntly; I was not able to finish the book, I think I read the first 50-60 pages before I had to set the book aside. The books that I have been unable to complete are few and far between.In 1974; she happened to encounter two South American Shamans (Damano and Chea Hetaka) are the names given in the book and studies with them.Chapter 3 ""Meeting Death And Destiny"" disturbed me very much; because the book looks to my somewhat trained eye; that Damano spiked Ms. Whitakers coffee with a psychotropic drug. Psychotropic drugs are NOT necessary, and NOT recommended..."
3,Frustrating main character,"A very interesting book with a compelling (for me) premise, but I was often frustrated with the narrator's fear of the changes she was experiencing. I looked forward to her next book, as she was supposed to be in training as a storyteller, but never saw one."
1,Not what I expected,"This book was more like reading a journal for someone who takes drugs regularly. It gave no practical information on journeying and I was really disappointed. If you are interested in reading someone's daydreamings, you might like it. I did not."
5,"INSPIRING, BEAUTIFUL, MAGICAL",One of my favorite books...I was caught up in the beauty and magic of the story...inspires you to look and pray for such a beautiful connection with shamanic teachers of heart and spirit!
2,Personal Story,"This is probably well done as the author's personal story. There isn't much transfer for my spiritual life. Therefore, I rated it low. A few sentences here & there spoke to me, but it wasn't what I need at this time for my spiritual growth."
5,Fully Engaging,"Brilliant, utterly compelling, and unforgettable. Highly recommended is an understatement. Far beyond and any other book on shamanism that I've read, this one is a multi-level, multi-sensory experience . It's one of those rare books that can awaken the reader's consciousness, compassion and heart. While autobiographical, the book also offers core information and teaching stories that are timeless. The author's personal experiences include exercises that can be easily put into practice. Yet,this is not another technique book. It's an irresistible call to remember and be who we truly are. It offers a path to living joyously in integrity with our Truth , Earth and all of Creation. One of a few books that I've read more then once. I am inspired by and grateful for the dedication, courage and commitment of the author and her teachers. This book is a treasure."
5,great album,"Great tribute album to a great band, Especially check out Alan Jackson's cover of sure got cold after the rain fell."
5,Works Great,"I was messing around on my drummers drums and his snare head gave out, so I felt obligated to buy him a new one. We play metal, so he literally beats the s*** out of it and its holding up really well! The sound is even better than the previous one. I RECOMMEND"
2,Not what we expected...,"I purchased this book to find recipes to make for my daughters 8th birthday. She had read all the Little House Series and had a ""Laura"" party. I was very disappointed when the recipe for making butter called for a food proccesor. I was looking for recipes that would illustrate the frontier lifestyle not modern day cooking. The recipes called for ingredients they wouldn't have or use."
3,Simple Cookbook for Children Who Love Little House books,"This is a very simple cookbook. My neice was so excited to try the recipes. I would recommend this for those children who are Little House fans. I think they will enjoy some of the recipes. Only downfall...some of the items are more old fashioned, such as, making homemade butter. However, if they would like to see what it would be like, or maybe a class project, this could be fun."
1,Not what it's cracked up to be,"Hello all, I just arrived on post in Germany. I'm an attractive guy, or so I'm told, and have a moderate personality. Since being new, I've been traveling around a lot, especially to the bars in Cologne, Trier, and Frankfurt. I bought this stuff out of curiousity to see if it had any added effect to my own natural charm. It doesn't. There were no approaches from women, increased reactions, squirming, or increased sexual arrousel as a result of wearing this stuff. It's a gimmic, in my opinion. Also, I've been checking out some of the other pheremone products offered on this site, and there seems to be 5 start reviews from the same folks. This is highly suspicious to me. Do yourself a favor and save your money. I find being yourself, relaxed, and go out to have fun, and not with the intent to try to find anything is the greatest way to meet women. It's always worked for me in the past. Hope this helps. Cheers"
3,Heavy aroma,"I've only used this particular gel a few times. It has a very strong aroma/odor. I suggest that if you use this product, you make sure you also use some type of cologne with it."
5,"Frank, Dean and Sammy At the Villa Venice, And How!!!","Though a bit ""grainy"" at times, this cd is a must-have for fans of Dean, Frank and Sammy. Of particular interest is Dean's ""Where or When"" and Frank's ""When Your Lover Is Gone."" Also worth the price of admission is Sammy and Frank's duet, ""Me and My Shadow.""Legends are made of this, pallie!!!"
2,Watered Down Rat Pack Performance,"This concert set is nothing more than the ""Live at the Villa Venice, 1962"" album with almost all of the charm removed from it. Portions of the album where Frank and the boys joke around with each other, banter with the audience, or make small mistakes have been edited out (sometimes even mid-song!), thus ruining what would otherwise be a marvelous example of the rat pack in action. Unless you are desperate to own a rat pack performance or are unable to find ""Live at the Villa Venice"", which I believe is only available as a German import, this one is to be avoided."
2,Not so great,"After about two uses this thing just ends up dry and hard to adjust. Not so great, I ended up going back to separate cups for measuring."
3,"wrong way, go back.","Don't get this record - instead, buy Previn's earlier recording of this symphony with the LSO on RCA Gold Seal.(You'll have to buy it second hand though, as I did. And ignore the above comment referring to the supposed poor sound - he's wrong.)"
3,nice,"This was different from what I thought I ordered, but it's ok. I'll live with it. I put it away and forgot I had it, or maybe I would have returned it."
5,Amazing Album,"Markology is a must for anyone who is interested in guitar or acoustic music. O'Connor pushes the limits of the guitar, producing a unique sound that has yet to be matched by bluegrass guitarists today. Tony Rice, Dan Crary and David Grisman accompany Mark, making for an intense flat picking journey. Mark O'connor chose the best to pick with him, and showed that he was just as advanced (probably more so) than the greatest flat pickers of our time!"
2,Poorly edited,"A disappointing condensation of an enjoyable play. The grammatical and typographical errors belie the claims that this adaptation is skillfully edited. The play also is missing stage directions at times, e.g., character instructed to leave stage when never instructed to enter. The play also drops some of the more amusing speeches from the mechanicals' presentation of Pyramus and Thisbee."
3,Nice read,This is a nice way to get an introduction to the play if you have never read it. It also offers great tips on how to set up your stage.
4,Excellent 40th and good 41st,"Wolfgang Amadeus MozartSymphony No. 40Symphony No. 41 ""Jupiter""Sir Charles MackerrasPrague Chamber Orchestra(Telarc - Digital - 1986)The reason to buy this CD is its great performance of the 40th. The 41st is very good but feels, at times, too rushed, at least compared to the superior version that Sir Colin Davis did in 1981. Still, it is a fine CD and it is the one I go to when wanting to hear the 40th. Four Stars (4 )"
3,Actually pretty cold,"Even though this CD is strongly touted by the Gramophone Guide, I was left feeling a little cold.I couldn't help the feeling that the 41st needed more warmth and inflection of sound, rather than just zipping strings. The 40th lacked much in punctuation and drama. There was very little resonance...Sample for yourself, and compare to Bernstein's DG. I love Mozart, and I respect Mackerras. I certainly won't make a judgement on his whole Mozart cycle, but...I looked forward to this CD, and was very disappointed. Three stars, since it isn't all bad."
2,Not as helpful as I hoped,I purchased this book a few months prior to moving to Houston because I thought it would provide me with inside information. I have not learned anything in this book that I wasn't able to find online. I felt it was a waste of money.
1,Save your money,"I was willing to spring the big bucks for this book thinking it would give me all of the useful information I needed. But, that isn't the case. Having just relocated here I now know what would have been useful and is lacking in this book. For instance, what do you need to get your car registered and your drivers license. Had I known I needed a Social Security card to get my license it would have saved me a trip to Conroe. It talks about Homestead Exemptions and should tell you how to go about getting one. A lot of the information is simplistic. For the price of this book themes should be developed and it should be packed with useful information."
1,Ridiculous price!,"50.00 for a paperback book only a few years old, which is mostly a collection of easily accessible infromation? Outrageous."
5,Life changing,Use this as a pick-me-up everyday. I keep mine in my office for that stressful moment when I need a thought-provoking getaway.
5,Instant Karma by Barbara Ann Kipfer,This is such a GREAT book. I would give it a million stars!! I think everyone in the world needs at least one copy. I bought one a year ago and I try to read one page everyday of my life. I just bought about 5-6 more because they are great birthday gifts!! It is such a great uplifting book!!
2,Slow movie without substance,"I am an avid golfer and a true student of the game who also caddied as a child. I found many elements of this movie relevant and true, but the movie delivered in an extremely slow fashion. Throughout the movie, one gets the sense that a climax is building, which eventually comes at the end but without much bravado. I would not recommend this movie if you have other movie options."
1,Half of a Good Movie,The first half starts to tell a good golf story. But somewhere on the way to a good movie the need to make the point that all rich people are basically evil gets in the way. The second half of the movie just made me shake my head with how bad a movie can be when scoring political points becomes the objective.
1,Worst golf movie ever? One of the worst movies ever.,"I'm both a golfer and a movie buff. Caddyshack, Happy Gilmore, and Stroke of Genius are the exceptions. Most golf movies are pretty bad. Until I saw ""A Gentleman's Game"", I thought Caddyshack 2 took the cake--no more. Is this movie about an aspiring young golfer, a comback story, an overbearing father story, a drunk racist story, a depressed mother story, a teen love affair story, or a sexual abuse story? I don't know. This movie tries to be all of these at random times. In my opinion, this isn't just the worst golf movie ever, it's one of the worst movies I ever sat through. It makes Caddyshack 2 seem worthy of an Oscar. Gary Sinise, how bad did you really need this paycheck?"
1,A terrible movie,If this director was trying to see how many ugly stereotypes he could cram into 111 minutes I think he succeeded. If you want to see a golf movie see any of the Bobby Jones flicks or better yet get some clubs and learn this wonderful game. You'll meet great folks whether its public or club golf.
2,"Seller was great, but movie was WAY too dark","We received our product on time and in the condition as advertised, but we couldn't get through the movie. It was WAY too dark (not the picture, the plot line)."
1,Too much money for obvious information,"I like Jeff Cooper a lot and recommend his books to everyone. However, Dave Landry's book is another story. This is a very shalow book that offers nothing more than common sense and stuff that he already wrote about on tradingmarkets.com. If you are thinking about buying this book, take a look at the amazon sales rank. It should tell you the truth. Currently the book is ranked 1,000,098. Far from a bestseller isn't it?"
3,Captures Mood of Johannesburg,"This is an odd work, perhaps because it is Gordimer's most autobiographical novel. There are few characters one can really identify with, but it is interesting to see how the author captures the disaffected of Johannesburg at a critical point in South African history. In sum, this is a decent first novel but little else."
3,A good read but not her best,"This is a good short read and well worth the few hours it takes to get through it, but it is an earlier novel and not one of her best. If you haven't yet read any Nadine Gordimer, I recommend that first you try ""None to Accompany Me,"" which is excellent."
5,New Age Dopeness!,"Wow, what can I say, this is an incredible album. After hearing good things about this album, I decided to check it out and I was shocked at how dope it was!Lyrically, Blu is crazy nice. Hes a good story teller, has a very nice flow, and just overall a great emcee. I didn't find any weaknesses in his lyrical abilities.Production wise is where this album is really dope. I think that every single beat on this album is versatile and bangin. Some nice beats are ""Simply Amazin"", ""Cold Hearted"", ""Dancing In The Rain""(Crazy nice beat), ""No Greater Love"", ""Narrow Path"", ""In Remembrance"", ""First Things First"", ""Soul Amazin"", ""The World Is..."".. Yea I basically named half the album. But seriously, if your a fan of true Hip-Hop beats and lyrics you will love this album hands down.Blu is one of those emcees that has a lot of potential and will only get iller. Check this album!My Top 5 Songs1.Simply Amazin2.Dancing In The Rain3.The Narrow Path4.First Things First5.Soul Amazin"
3,Surprised by the high ratings,"I am surprised that this had almost exclusively high ratings. The CD is good, but that is about the best thing I can say about it. There aren't many tracks that I wanted to play over and over or tell my friends ""Hey you have to listen to this"". You can put the CD in and listen from start to finish but it just isn't great."
5,Best 7 bucks I've spent in a long time.,Just a fantastic album. Listen to the snippets and read the other reviews. This one isn't very helpful. I'm just happy with the purchase. No telling when something this good will come out again.
3,More used than I expected,The seller rated this item as being in very good condition. When I received the item it looked very used. The front and back covers were very faded and worn. I found another copy of the book in much better condition at a used bookstore a couple weeks later.
5,Excellent bio!,Excellent read. I particularly liked the conversation with Chandra at the end. What is truly amazing is the depth of his intellect outside physics and mathematics. My only criticism of the book is lack of personal content post circa 1950. There is great detail about his father and grandfather but barely a mention of his own children.They don't make men like Chandra anymore.
4,Bought for my 3 year old daughter,My daughter loves to build with blocks so I thought this would be her next step. I am giving it to her as a Christmas gift. I think she will really love it. My husband is excited to play with it with her.
5,Kids will enjoy it for years,"This is a great ""build it together"" toy and a great one-on-one quiet time activity. Even at 2 or 3, your child will enjoy helping pick out one of the several great projects. Then he/she can assist when you ask for certain colors or shapes (""I need 3 red sticks and 2 blue wheels""). Unlike most toys, this toy will be enjoyed by kids for years. I love seeing my older kids play with my little one with this. As child gets older, they can start putting pieces together, make up their own designs, and eventually build the projects themselves. We've had this set for over five years and used by 3 kids: I'm amazed at how well it's held up. A few snapped pieces and a few pieces that longer stay together, but 90% are in great condition. Our other favorite building toys areLEGO DUPLO Bricks & More Deluxe Brick Box 5507WEDGiTS Deluxe Set - 30 Piece Set.Lincoln Logs Classic Edition Tin Lincoln Logsand of course, good ol' building blocks."
2,"Fragile, pieces don't fit, pieces missing","A few significant issues:- String for crane was way too short to build as instructed.- Number of pieces provided for some things conflict with instructions which tell you that you need more than they give you. Better be a McGyver or your kid will be unhappy.- Pieces that need to fit snugly together don't, so the finished product (like race car) can't be moved or touched or it falls apart.- sticks are fragile. If you don't pull them exactly straight out of holes when dis-assembling the ends of the sticks crack. I don't know about your 5 YO's ability to pull stuff exactly straight out, but mine doesn't quite get that. And in some configurations, it is impossible even for an adult. Needless to say, it is breaking after only a few uses.Net-net: if your kid wants to build something and put it on the shelf and never touch it or never re-use to build something else, this is a good kit. If they actually are a kid and want to play with it, then look elsewhere."
3,"Fun, but very fragile","I got this for my 4-year-old boy.He made the ferris wheel following the instruction included in the set. He was very proud of himself for such an accomplishment. However, when he tried to take it apart, the sticks started to crack at their ends. I tried it and I broke a few too. Apparently you have pull the sticks ""straight"" out. If you wriggle them to loosen, the sticks crack. It is not as durable as it should be."
2,Wild Highland Rose Book 2,The story line is intriguing but there is too much sex being described in too much depth that you have to get past.
1,Does not work well - Go with Scansoft instead,"The I used to have Scansoft Textbridge and Omnipage and got ReadIris Pro to change. I mad a mistake the OCR from Scansoft is way better, it performs very well and Textbridge is much easier to use than Readiris.Don't do my mistake, stick to Scansoft, they also have a better customer and technical support than IRIS"
1,Worst OCR software I've ever seen,"Apart from the program crashing every other time it is used, the features are archaic and besides, it requires you register within 30 days of installation or else ... it blows up - just like win XP.I will recommend OmniPage any day over ""readiris"". I'm extremely disappointed over the purchase and unfortunately, no money back on this junk."
5,A Deeply Brilliant Book,"It's time this generation of lawyers recognizes Akhil Amar as its top scholar and thinker. He does not have a competitor. If he is not bound for the Supreme Court, that itself will be a great injustice...."
5,Brilliant,"I have read a lot of books on constitutional law, but none as consistently interesting and simply brilliant as this one. A true intellectual treat: a magnificent concoction of jurisprudence, history and constitutional analysis."
5,VERY good even for those who think they know all the tricks!,"It's amazing how many things I did not think of before that are mentioned in this book. I read a lot, but the tips for massage, using the under-side of your tongue, using a caligraphic brush, different positions and almost ALL that is pleasurable during sex are amazing. A must read. The chapters about masturbation and genital massage are very detailed and well written. My new favorite! (old favorite: Mantak Chia's ""Multi-Orgasmic Man"")"
4,Entertaining philosophy of life,"Believe it or not, I had this on my wish list and an online friend sent me a copy. I am forever indebted. It may not be the ultimate techniques manual, but it definitely was an enjoyable book. The author is obviously a lady who enjoys living life and not just sitting on a fence listening to the lively tales of others' adventures! She also has the spirit of experiment, and either tries out different philosophies or styles of sexual satisfaction or interviews others who have. She reviews ancient asian techniques, the sexual philosophy of Tanta, and more modern approaches intended to get one ""in touch with ones own body."" It took me forever to read--for which I appologize to the giver--not because it was complicated, dull or lengthy, but because I enjoyed reading it a little at a time."
3,Avid Reader,"This book is worth getting considering it's wisdom. It doesn't have any pictures to show how to execute some of the techniques, but that didn't bother me. I was still able to grasp and apply what I learned from this book."
1,Insultingly simplistic,"This book is replete with fluff and not an ounce of scientific or even quasi-scientific knowledge. Instead, the author tells men how to masturbate and kiss, and her other advice is equally lacking in novelty. An average person would prefer a discussion of more substantive topics which may impart knowledge that the reader was not acquainted with decades ago."
3,Traven wanders through more hard work,"This novel, like ""The Death Ship,"" does not have atraditional narrative structure. And like ""The Death Ship"" this story is narrated by Gales, a crazy American who goes through life doing one lousy job after the other. From cotton picker to cowboy, from baker to wanderer, Traven once again takes Gales through a trial-by-toil world.Of course the book is entertaining and it's even insightful (especially if you've ever had a job in Mexico); but what worked so well for ""The Death Ship"" doesn't seem to be as effective here. It lacks the tough satire that his first novels has.Also, if you've read ""The Night Vistor and other stories"" you'll feel a little ripped off, since about 40 pages overlap between these two volumes. But if you haven't, then you're in for a pretty good treat.I mean, nobody sweats like Traven."
2,Nice features but short on distance.,"This phone has a nice form factor; contoured to fit your face and hand. Rubber bumpers on the rounded corners make it fairly durable. Headphone jack is handy too. BUT... for all the hype (GigaRange Extreme!) it can't keep up with the two 900 MHz DSS phones I tested it against. With their base stations placed in exactly the same spot, both the Sony SPP-SS965 900 MHz Digital Spread Spectrum and a 3 year old Escort CT 9701 Digital Spread Spectrum both outperformed the Panasonic in terms of useable distance by approx 180 - 200% in diameter. I even tested two samples of the Panasonic to make sure I didn't have a defective unit.The Panasonic is great for running around the house or a small yard, but don't expect to roam around the neighborhood and stay connected. If that's your goal, buy the Sony."
4,I think it is a great phone.,"I bought this phone last month, and I must say that I have not had any problems with it. On the contrary, I think it is a very good phone.The sound is very clear, and it gives you a an audible signal when the battery is almost dead. It has a very nice slim design, (almost as small as my cell phone),and I love its black color.Best of all, there is a earphone jack provided so that you can listen through headphones. (must be made specifically for phones)There is only one problem I have with the phone, it is that there is no volume control. Sometimes when my children are going haywire I would like to turn it up. Unfortunatly, that is not an option.Other than that, I truly like this phone. I have been through many cordless ones over this past year, and this one is my favorite."
4,unfortunate,They were sent with a past date of sale on them. Being it is hard candy I kept it but I think sell by dates need to be checked.
5,butter rum lifesavers,"Came to my door, package contain two well guarded 10 roll packs. up on opening the package I found the product to be fresh and delicious"
2,Nothing new.,This really didn't seem to give me what I was looking for. My cholesterol didn't go down at all after following it.
3,Controlling Cholestrol The Natural Way,"This book helped me in some ways, but it was not a simple book to read. I felt that there could have been more information on the exact foods to eat to lower the cholestrol. I will not be using it as an reference"
2,Not what I expected,"I was hoping this book would be directed and smart eating strategies for lowering bad and increasing good cholesterol. Instead, it was basically an advertisement for some kind of chemical supplement that can't be found anywhere."
4,beating cholesterol!,"If you are like me and cannot take 'statin' drugs, you will appreciate the information in this book. It may tell you some things you already knew, but it also focuses on the natural approach. I think this book is a good reference book for anyone trying to combat inherited high cholesterol and wants alternatives to prescription drugs. I lowered mine from 330 to 220-still high but oh so much better."
4,Tigers are everywhere,The book has good information. Seems it covers all the units that were issued with the Tigers. The action accounts are dryfacts. One thing that caught me the author seems fixiated oncovering the turret numbering system over and over and over again. I liked the pictures in the book. These were the real deal. These pictures looked like they came from former crew members and combat photographers not the type from German propaganda. Pictures scored the 4
3,Awesome Pics,"Many fantastic photos...but not much else, unless you want to know Panzer Battalion structures and equipment."
3,Dissappointing but still essential copy,"I agree with many of the reviews posted in regards to the quality of the new paperback editions. Having seen the hardcover copies and now owning the paperback the photo quality has suffered greatly with many details now not being seen. Still it is full of info on the day to day operations of Tiger units and hundreds of photos. If you can find a copy (cheap!) of the orginal hardcover get that, even if it si a little more money than the paperback, its worth it."
2,Very bad pictures,Most pictures in the book are very badly reproduced. The color plates are very small. Some unit organization charts are badly printed.
5,Mr. Coffee Cafe' Motion....Great!,I love this product from Mr. Coffee. It makes wonderful hot chocolate really fast. It also makes wonderful hot coffee drinks. It puts just the right amount of foam. I would recommend this to anybody who loves hot drinks. I can't wait until it gets really cold outside so I can really enjoy the hot chocolate. Give it a try you won't be sorry.
1,Lasted less than 3 uses. Poorly designed and hard to clean.,"I agree with the description made by another 1 star review. Very accurate description. After getting 3 lemons of the Cocomotion, I decided to try this one. Cocomotion works better, better design and makes a better drink. This one doesnt produce as good of a drink and I dont like the way it heats and its timer. Mine lasted less than 3 uses. Is you really want to try one try the cocomotion. MY friends lasted 3+ yrs."
4,Love this machine,"I was torn between a Mr. Coffee Cocomotion or this. So very glad I got this. It is soooooo easy to use. Just put milk, cocoa, sugar, etc. in the container, turn it on and there you be! If you are making just one cup and it isn't hot enough, turn up the dial. As to clean up, as soon as I pour my milk in my cup, I rinse out the container. No fuss. Highly recommend this beverage maker. Gives a great froth too. Especially nice for my cappuccinos and lattes."
5,Fun and Easy,"Santa brought this fun little appliance for my 8 year old daughter that likes to drink hot chocolate nearly every day. This thing is pretty quiet, very easy to use, and clean-up is very simple. It seems to make even the less expensive powdered hot chocolate taste better. We had company for the holidays and everyone loved using it and having a nice cup of hot chocolate. I recommend rinsing the pitcher out soon after use as that makes clean-up very simple. Santa is very happy with his find!"
1,Jensen SC340,Totally worthless! We bought 15 of these and each one stopped working after being in use for no more than 2 weeks. Not a battery problem...
1,a zero,"I've had this one for about a month and a half, and it quit working. Also, it would only work if pointed exactly at the base of the t.v. A little bit one side or the other and up or down and it would not work. I learned my lesson, you get what you pay for."
1,Jensen SC340,"Garbage! Save your money. Woked for about an hour then totally broke down. The lights did not work to indicate your pressing a button ,etc...DONT BUY"
4,Great value and excellent on-line support.,"This is a great remote control for the price...The buttons are laid out logically and they are very easy to read. It's been very dependable and it holds its' program much longer than other universal remotes I've purchased. The best experience with this product, however happened recently when the remote had lost its' program. I, of course, could not remember the 3-digit code that my T.V. used. After a week of getting up to change channels I finally decided to check the internet. I found the site; jensenremotes, which was absolutely great. Everything I needed to know to reprogram my remote was on that site. It was a great service and much better than calling an 800# and going through layers and layers of menu options before being put on hold for 10 min. to talk to a ""tech support"" person.... Considering this kind of support I'm am confident in saying that this is the best universal remote you'll ever own."
4,"Nice, inexpensive remote","Worked well with my Sony TV and JVC vcr, both fairly recent models. The auto code set appeared to work for both but not all buttons were functional so I had to set them manually--not difficult. Definitely worth the money if you have a newer model TV and/or vcr."
2,Worked on one TV but not the other,This remote would not work on my old style Sanyo TV. I tried for a long time to get it to read but it never did. It did work on my newer Sony TV and my memorex VCR. Definitly worth 10 bucks if it works on your set.
2,A mixed bag...,"This things works GREAT when it works.... After the auto program feature was tried and only picked up my Panasonic TV, I managed to manually program the Toshiba DVD player. After 2 weeks I've given up on getting the VCR (Panasonic) to work and there are no provisions for CD (if you have DVD) or receiver. Live and learn."
3,It's about time,"Now this is the book I was hoping Randall Robinson would write. The topic of what blacks owe each other has been discussed in other books but Robinson's work is bound to have a wider audience. It didn't seem as passionate as THE DEBT and it doesn't go far enough but this book will get you thinking about how black people treat and see each other.Kimberley Lindsay Wilson, author of Work It! The Black Woman's Guide to Success at Work."
1,the debt? please refund for this idiotic book,"i guess anyone can get published these days, even jackbooted morons like randall. hey the biggest perpetrators of racism in today's america are racist bigoted blacks like yourself randall. check yourself fool. love and peace is oh so neat, but randall's book smells like stinky ole feet.if you have any semblance of a brain and can think rationally, avoid this clown trying to leech off the black community with sucker-punch books like this one."
1,Existentialism is depressing!!!!!!!!,"wow. I don't know who said it but they're right, ""the only legitimate point for an existentialist to debate is whether to commit suicide.""skip existentialism unless you've had a life changing bad experience in life. then still skip existentialism.be happy in life, find something positive to live for.Existentialists are not people you would want at a party.The book was cheap and came as ordered."
3,Revolutionary After Effects 5.5 Enhancing Digital Video,"This book is not very good if you are a brand new user to After Effects. I found myself continuously going to the help button to find the item the book told me to use. I thought about selling it back as a used book, but I didn't want to be responsible for someone else wasting their money. Do not buy this book unless you already know the basics in After Effects. There are some good tips, but that was not why I bought this; I had never used After Effects and thought this was a step by step tutorial."
2,Love Them Hopping Zombies!,"First: Neither of the movies on this DVD have anything to do with the Five Deadly Venoms series. That said, 5 Venoms vs Wu Tang is actually Ku Fu Vampire Buster (1987), an unsophisticated comedy about a Taoist priest and a magician competing to capture a baby zombie. The movie is geared toward kids and is full of acrobatics, magic, hopping zombies, ghosts, vampires and just plain silliness. It is a lot of fun, moves fast and has a couple of good laughs. This is a direct transfer from tape, so the quality is just adequate. However, it is in widecreen and is subtitled. Skip the second feature."
2,Really Should Be Stolen,"It is just so hard to imagine the best of artists with a littel alpse in their creativity these days. Sting is one of those few artists that really rarely has that happen. His song, Stolen Car (Take Me Dancing), the second track from Sting's 2003 Sacred Love record, isn't really as diverse of sof spoken to the message just like his previous single, Send Your Love. All in all, that really isn't one of Sting's most enjoyable tracks at all. The beat on this song and the lyrics actually didn't go all in together. For die hard Sting fans, they might not enjoy this one, and neither do I. Hopefully, he'll make some better songs than this one."
1,What's the point...,"with ALL these various remixes and versions? The song, the ""album-extended-whatever-version"" is really good - so when you want to buy the single you want THAT SONG, not totally ""different"" song -don't you??This is the problem with many of todays' singles, also with Stings' - do we really want any other versions than studio or live? I know for sure I don't! What's the point in releasing singles when you don't get the song you want??A Sting-fan."
1,Come on Sting....You are so much better.,"I confess. I am one of the biggest Sting fans around. I have purchased every Sting album (since The Police). This album is undoubtably the worst, such a waste of talent. Pass this one up and buy the rest."
5,The best I've ever seen,"I had to purchase this edition of the Harrap Dictionary to replace my old paperback copy that I had worn out to the point of disintegration through prolonged and repeated use. Every word or phrase you could ever hope to learn in Spanish can be found in this dictionary. It not only gives you definitions of single words, but assists you in learning how to use the words in their proper context. It includes slang terms and phrases, and is invaluable in learning not only how to say words, but how to communicate in Spanish. If you're looking for a Spanish/English or English/Spanish Dictionary, this is where your search should end."
3,Cute but not worth $50,"The costume is really cute, but it doesn't come with the frill skirt underneath, and the laces in the front will show your stomach if they aren't laced up tight enough. For $50 it's not worth it, but if it's a last minute thing (like it was for me), then it's a valid choice because it's only one piece."
1,it looks way better in the pictures.,"i received this item by mail and once i opened it i was pretty upset to find that this costume was a spandex material . in the pictures it does not look spandex. if you don't tie the front strings super tight then your stomach shows. don't waste your time on this.. luckily I'm getting a refund and i went and bought the grechin beer wench costume, which i absolutely love."
2,Fake,"This costume looks a lot better on the site than in person,it just looks very cheap when you get it. Sizing is weird too, especially through the bust. I have a large chest so I'm used to that being an issue but my nipples we're actually out. And because the straps are thick, I couldn't adjust how it laid without having them bunch out."
4,Good German Bossa Nova from Washington DC,"I agree with the first reviewer: you're either going to love it or hate it. I particularly like it because of one track, ""Von 7 bis 8,"" a light little number about going out to grab breakfast rolls from a local bakery, the real way to start the day in Germany (especially on the weekend). Do be warned: the lyrics are in German, but the atmosphere needs no translation -- it means relaxation. A cheerful, gentle feeling, accompanied by metallic and sparkling tones. A good CD for a rainy day--it has a sort of rainy or misty day feel."
3,Hong Kong on the Themse,"It is hard writing comment on a law budget movie with action around action of which all personages are partly-police, partly-crims hunting each other and mercilessly blooding any on their ways while a ringleader tries getting a rid of his-assassin-to-be witnessing the massacre.Love-lines and sex-for-sale motive have been deployed.To a reviewer, a general impression is a typical Hong-Kong style movie with correction on modern UK ethnicity."
4,Awsome shoot-em up flick,"Well i think you all under rate this awsome gorey, bloody soaked in violance movie. i actually got my copy from a friend and i havent returned it since! well he didnt care and didnt like it as much as i did. but anyways great movie, great acting and great sound track. btw anyone know the name to the song they play on the dvd title? i would like to pick it up"
1,Gross Missuse of Firearms,"The first gunfight in this movie is so painful, it was a migraine headache to watch the rest. There is even a karate scene after that which looks like amatuer wrestling at best. I somehow doubt this is camp. God help us all if you decide to buy this."
3,Over acting & odd script -- but a great violent b movie.,"In looking for the soundtrack to this movie, I came across the dvd & reviews. This movie IS pretty bad, and everything that 'Matt's' review said it was. But that is why I found it so entertaining. It made me LAUGH. ... If you are a fan of the classic Hong Kong assembly line action movie (terribly scripted & badly acted violent action movies) -- you will enjoy this. Its all that with a TOUCH of hip'ness. It's like watching a car crash -- you dont want to but you cant quite help it."
1,Oh...my...God!,"24 Hours in London isn't the worst movie ever made, it just feels like it. It started off okay but you can tell right away that it's one of those straight to video B movies-- just bad enough to be good. I almost expected Eric Roberts or Rutger Hauer to show up. But it went from bad to worse to one of THE WORST movies you'll ever see. It was disturbingly bad, not to mention just plain disturbing. Like ""Seven,"" or ""Salo"" (never seen the latter but from what I hear I never want to),it's one of those movies that makes you feel different for several days after watching it. You know a flick is bad when the villains tell you every detail of their sinister plan before they off you. It's good for a stoned laugh or two...maybe three because the acting and dialogue are deplorable. I wish I could give it a -5 stars. Ridiculous. The good news is it only cost me 1 dollar. I guess you get what you pay for."
5,"Song for Humanity by Peter Kater, R.Carlos Nakai","I heard this song last night, for the first time, on the atmopheres station, and as I listened it seemed soft and ""haunting""...taking the meaning to be ""recurring often in the mind""... in a mellow way. I love that we have a song for humanity...another step up in our journey."
3,"Nice story, however...","The Confidant is a fascinating, but rather amateurishly written historical novel. It follows it's Mexican/Jewish hero throughout his adventurous career in aviation and behind-the-scenes politics, connecting at various points with his friend and mentor Lyndon Johnson. If less attention was spent on our egotistical hero's love life (sticking to the story), and the author sought out better editing (a distraction from an otherwise interesting story), it could have been considerably better.On the plus side Kevin Zealberg is a good storyteller, and seems to have done his historical research well, so hopefully his future work will only get better."
5,great mix to relax to,"dont get misled by the title of this cd. this is not dub as you may know it. in fact there's more vocal songs on this compilation than on any other that has the word dub in its title. but it's more a feeling that is presented here - a laid back, chilled out vibe that the listener can hear in e.g. a william s.burroughs & gus van sant cooperation (!) a french reggae tune or a german hip hop instrumental. if you fancy the europes downtempo and dub avantgarde with such acts like kruder 6 dorfmeister, shantel, rockers hi-fi or jazzanova, you'll like it. it's been spinning on my hifi for two weeks now non stop. and it didnt got boring for a minute."
4,Good enough,"Don't pay more, this one is good enough. It is soft, comfortable on the eyes, fits everyone in my family and does the job. However, it may be a little itchy around the bridge of the nose."
4,too cute!,As a gifter of these unique Antenna Toppers I thought they would be well recieved-but they surpassed any thoughts I had! Fan-tastic!
5,scotch brite,"If you ever used this product you would always keep some on hand. And you can't beat the price. Make sure you de-grease whatever you are removing the gasket from before using this product, or it will become plugged."
5,Great Family Game,"I had never heard of this game before but my family and I have been playing as a family for a while now (kids are 10 and 7). As I was looking around Amazon for Christmas gifts, this game caught my eye.It is soooo much fun ! We have played it over 20 times over the past 2 weeks and my son keeps asking us to play !!I recommend it highly."
4,A Guide to Research in Music Education,This book in its 5th edition is a collection of articles dealing with music education research. It provides some early steps to selection a research problem and the research process. Then it includes various types of research projects. It is well written and easy to read. I recommend it to any music education students planning on pursuing research in music education.
1,easy install can lead to trouble,"It's easy to install and start using. Beware, though. If you have to reinstall for any reason, you will find yourself locked out or your own password file. I have tried several times to contact customer support about this (by fax and email) but have received no response. If you don't worry what happens three years down the road when you get another handheld or another computer, go right ahead, this one is for you."
2,Largely a waste of time.,"Although I agreed with the perspective of the author more often than not, this textbook has an unmistakably liberal slant. The author's first priority seems to be indoctrinating students into his point of view on various academic disputes, as opposed to providing students with practical knowledge about property law and it's day-to-day applications. Many of the issues discussed at length are interesting, but our familiarity with them has no utility to our future clients or employers."
3,Nothing Exceptional...,"As I'm nearing the end of a full semester reading this book, I must say that this book is nothing special. It has an incredibly liberal spin and discusses complex subject matter as ""notes,"" which often confuses things. While it's not the worst I've read, don't believe that this book is anything extraordinary."
3,Phil's review,"This games is very similair to Wings over Vietnam, While it is enjoyable to play it dosen't offer enough new actions for me to recommend it above others flight combat games."
3,wings over europe,"wings over europe:cold war gone hot,is a decent game,except i have some problems,with the manual,as far as lengthy.If your thinking of just jumping into to the game,after you install it,think again.The long manual,should be shorter."
3,Straight forward combat flight sim,Overall the game is pretty fun. The flight characteristics are different between all the different planes. There are two small bugs I've noticed but I don't know if that is due to the original game or the patch I installed (1.08). The only big thing that is annoying is the long time it takes for the mission to start. The graphics are pretty good.

3,"Outstanding Lenore, hasty Sixth","The Sixth Symphony of this Telarc series is notably less polished than all other 8 symphonies. The Lenore Overture is, however, simply breathtaking."
3,Slightly dull reading by Dohnanyi,"Since two gave two star reviews and two gave four star reviews I will split the difference and give it a three star rating and keep the average at three stars. I'm not very happy about the sound quality (it sounds rather dull sonically for a Telarc recording) and the interpretation is nothing to write home about. I have very old analog recordings of this that sound quite a bit better than this Telarc version. Basically, this has little feeling and is played rather straight ,and basically, this is just an average run through. I don't feel to bad because I just paid for it used from a used cd seller for about $4.99 but I don't see myself listening to this again because I have many other versions of the ""Pastoral"" on cd that are far better sonically and interpretavly."
2,A hasty reading with little feeling,"I don't think lovers of either romantic Beehtoven or period Beethoven would like dohnanyi's reading, hwich is too fast to pause for lingering insights--or even much phrasing--and yet too heavy for a true period feeling. The Leonore #3 is exceptionally dull. But I should admit that in generl I find Dohnanyi dull. I bought this recording after hearing him conduct a lively, intense Beethoven 7th in Boston. Maybe you have to hear him live."
2,LA FIRMA DE BEETHOVEN,"Un disco muy bien presentado desde el punto de vista estético, en la tapa la firma del gran maestro de Bonn, lastima que el contenido del mismo sea de tan bajo valor artístico, La Pastoral por Dohnányi, carece de emotividad, simplemente suena, en el movimiento final, cuando se supone que la obra llega a su máxima expresión poética, Dohnányi nos deja fríos. Que diferencia al oír la versión del Dr. Karl Bohm, donde realmente encontramos la firma de Beethoven en el contenido del disco. De la Leonora 3, podemos decir que Dohnányi mejora, más no por mucho.Francisco J. Muñoz (fmunozzzz@yahoo.com)"
5,X10 Auto Control of Kitchen Cabinet Lights,"This setup is so simple it's ridiculous. Take the battery powered Motion Detector and a Wireless Transceiver Module (TM751) and you have a complete system for controling lights. Just plug the cord from the lights into the TM751. Now whenever someone walks into my kitchen, the under-cabinet lights turn on. I programmed it to shut them off after 30 minutes. The unit is programmed by a sequence of presses on the two buttons. It's a little tricky but the instructions are clear. Write down the steps because in a year or so you will need to do it again when you replace the batteries."
4,Very good but needs sensitivity adjustment.,Bought this motion sensor to detect animals coming on our deck at night. It works great but also detects the wind blowing the grill cover and rocking chairs. The only way to adjust the sensitivity is to place narrow strips of black electricians tape on each side of the detection window to narrow the detection field.. After several nights of trial and error I found the sweet spot and it works fine.This unit can be set to detect day and night or just night. The range I am using is around 10 feet between sensor and receiver.
1,Waste Of Money,"We purchased this toy for our son last Christmas. First of all an eight year old will not be able to put this together. It might even be difficult for an adult. When we finally finished it we put it on and it was having major problems. The gears kept skipping. We called the company to see if there was something that we could do and they told us ""Well, really this toy is not ment to last"" a lot of help they were. So over all it was a giant waste of money. It has made it's final resting place in the dump."
1,Unable to complete model due to pieces missing,"I purchased this for my son's 8th birthday. He was delighted. Unfortunately the excitement quickly faded when we discovered that two crown gears were not included in the box. I contacted the company and they quickly agreed to mail these to me. Two weeks later, the geers have not arrived. When contacting the company again, I was told that these were air mailed the day of my original contact and that I would now need to contact my ""local dealer"". A web site was provided. Unfortunately the local dealer is a full days drive away. This has resulted in a very disappointed boy and little confidence in the company or their customer relations."
4,Good Review of Formulas and Functions,"This book does a nice job on reviewing formulas and functions. It covers a lot of functions that other books gloss over or don't mention such as arrays, rounding, date/time functions etc.It spends a lot of time on logic and lookup functions. Best of all, it uses good business examples that help explain how to use the function. My big gripe with the book is that at times it skips details and just assumes the reader knows how to do something or understands why you would want to do something. Personally, I think the 2003 version explained details a little bit better however I still think that this is one of the better books out there for people wanting to use formulas and functions in a business environment. If you are looking for a book on solver and what-if however there are a lot better books out there."
2,not by DR. Perricone,"If you are looking for information by Nicolas Perricone, and thought this was a diet book to help with his methods, do not buy this book! This is a group of Italian style receipies from an Italian restaurant. The book is small, and though I thought a few of the recipes looked good, it isnt what I expected. I plan to return it."
3,D20 Oriental Adventures Monster book,"Creatures of Rokugan is a good source book for monster's in an oriental adventures campaing, however it lacks support for the previous d10 system.The book is a collection of stats and good monsters description, but you wouldn't find any extraordinary source of good roleplaying information.Some of this monsters will add some spice to your current d20 campaing, but is up to you if you want your adventurers to find a ghostly corrupted samurai in their next dungeon."
1,Not as easy to hook up as they say.,After doing three uninstalls and reinstalls my scanner is still not working. The error message is that the computer cannot find the hook up. The support guy at microtek tried but couldn't figure out my problem. I threw the box away so I'm probably stuck with it. My other problem with this scanner is that the support number is not an 800 number. By the time you're done talking to someone in support you could easily spend an hour on a long distance call. Why should I have to pay for that?
1,Slim Scan C6,"My Slim Scan came pre programed but never worked. Windows kept telling me it is not hooked up. Also no inside light or manuals. I was sent another one which also has no inside light, a broken hinge on the door and again my computer tells me it is not connected. I give up I am buying another type of scanner. The c6 does not work for me."
3,"Quality Scanner, not so easy set-up","Installing the software is not necessarily easy. After going through installation, my Windows 98 machine locked up upon re-boot. If you e-mail or call Microtek support they will inform you how to get past this. Support is great, and product is excellent, once it's configured properly."
2,Not up to Microtek standards,"I bought this scanner because of its low profile and ""scan"" button, and because my Microtek E3 was a great product. Unfortunately, hookup was a problem. Microtek seems to have written their code to require the very latest USB drivers from Intel, so unless you find the right support note on the Microtek web site (and the link to Intel's page) you will be very frustrated hooking this USB device up to your system. Even after a four-hour installation process, I still cannot get the button on the front of the scanner to function properly. The ScanWizard TWAIN driver is excellent, but don't bother installing the rest of the software. The OCR package is particularly poor. The only redeeming thing about this product is its price and it's low profile"
5,Mine works great and the installations was a breeze!,"I bought the SlimScan C6 in a store, not online, and I was very satisfied! I have the parallel port version. It was very easy to set up. Just plug you printer into your scanner then your scanner into your computer. That's it. The software was easy to. Just follow the on screen directions. Plus the software they gave was great! Overall I thought this product deserves all the stars it can get!"
4,"A fine product, by a fine company.","After being quite content with my now-outdated Microtek E3 SCSI scanner, I decided to go Microtek again with the new slimscan USB. Although I would say that scans are slower than the older SCSI model, the overall quality is much better, and the interface is improved. As mentioned in other reviews, the OCR provided with the package is somewhat weak, but functional. I would recommend purchasing OmniPage Pro by Caere for higher-quality OCR recognition, although this may run you around a hundred dollars, last time I checked. The model is quite thin, although I too have had troubles making the button in the front, which is supposed to launch applications in Windows, functional. All in all a solid purchase at a solid value.-Pete"
1,Requirements,The system requirements before this was ordered indicated the scanner could be used with Windows 95. Upon receiving the scanner as a gift(ordered thru Amazon) there are no instructions for loading to Windows 95. The outside of the box says Window 98 is a minimum requirement. The scanner seems like it would be a great product. I wish I could use it.
1,What interface does this use?,"If the author of the above blurb would indicate the I/F (USB, parallel or SCSI) that this thing uses it would sure help making a purchase decision!"
1,"first expieriance, could not get unit to work.","the software is great! we cannot get the drivers to load properly, and the scanner itself doesn't work. it does look pretty good though."
1,Un verdadero fiasco,"Compré este disco compacto con la ilusión de escuchar aquel sonido tan alegre, cálido y peculiar del grupo Corraleros del Majagual. Lamentablemente este disco no tiene ninguna canción interpretada por los Corraleros del Majagual de los años sesenta. En este disco no hay nada de aquellos intérpretes que alegraron con su estilo nuestras fiestas familiares en los años sesenta y setenta. Qué pena haber gastado dinero en un disco que no mejorará en nada las colecciones de música de quienes como yo preferimos las grabaciones e intérpretes originales. Estoy decepcionado..."
1,don't bother,"Really, don't. Same old stuff every issue...given that you ever find the 'articles' of course, through countless pages of ads that don't do anything but turn the consumer away. I made the mistake of subscribing when I moved here last year. I now have other local mags I much prefer as representative of this thriving Bay area. - Francis J. Carnegie, Avila."
1,Substance-less magazine with way too many ads!,"If you're looking for a bunch of useless fluff and want to look at nothing but advertisements, then I would highly recommend this mullet wrapper.It is a big waste of money to purchase Tampa Bay Magazine. I'm sure it would look better lining the bottom of a parakeet page than on your coffee table.The editor, Aaron Fodiman, obviously has a HUGE ego. He doesn't come across as sincere, rather he comes across as an arrogant, pompous ass that would back-stab you in a heart beat!I found my copy of Tampa Bay Magazine in a pile of garbage, right where it belongs. I'm just sorry that I picked it up in the first place. What a pant-load of nonsensical trash that is trying to appear as some sort of ""elite wannabe."" Hate to tell you this, Aaron, but elite - you are not."
5,Easily the best introduction to linear algebra,"I've tried to learn on my own from several other linear algebra books (Anton, Lay, McMahon), but like many college-level math textbooks, the authors too often emphasize elegance at the cost of clarity. This frequently leaves me scratching my head, asking ""How did he get here from there""? Bronson is the only linear algebra text I've seen that SKIPS NO STEPS. I wish more mathematicians understood how critical to learning explanation and illustration are, in contrast to adding Yet Another Proof.This is not to say that Bronson isn't rigorous. But his exposition comes first; only then does he get formal--his proofs do not substitute for discussion. (In fact, his proofs are often quite straightforward and intuitive, IMHO).Bronson's is a very welcome attitude among math instructors. This is an excellent book."
3,"Well written, but too many typos and mistakes.","Overall this is very well written, an excellent introduction to the subject. It would definitely be a five-star book if it weren't for all the mistakes. A few typos are acceptable, but too many of the example problems and solutions had incorrect, confusing errors. I spent most of my reading time trying to sort these out!"
1,Not My Cup of Tea...,"I got a bad batch and was sent another to try out. It was better but still not what I expected. On both, the pieces were very small for some reason. I was looking for some like the ones in MREs, which are excellent. These may be OK for cooking, but not what I wanted. This company's customer service is top notch though."
3,OK Book,This is a decent reference book but you can google most of the info. In earlier editions it had server/pc/laptop info. Now they have separated that info out into three different books. I started with the 11th edition - I am now on the 17th edition. I will not get the next edition.
3,Left feeling so-so,"First off, let me say that if you are buying this book as a reference manual, then I think it deserves 5 stars. If you are using it to supplement your studies for something like A+ certification, its not the best for that. The problem lies in the fact that, like another reviewer here pointed out, he deals way to much with history. I feel like this took away a lot from trying to learn from the book as it became a boring read after a while. I dont care about computers from 20 years ago. I want to know recent things. A HUGE problem I have is their website. NONE of the video archives work. This was a huge selling point for me and was/is a tremendous disappointment. I contacted the webmaster 3 weeks ago and the problem hasnt been fixed. They all lead to a 404 error-page not found. That is a joke and an outrage."
2,Spend a little more money to get a better stand,"I purchased this stand and it arrived slightly bent. It is usable, but is a very flimsy product. My advice is to spend a little more money and get a better product."
4,Very good for the price,"This rug is very good for the price. I'm glad I bought it. But if you have cats, like us, you will have to thoroughly vaccuum the rug every day. Because the cats also love the rug and the cat hair sticks to the dark blue part of the rug like glue. But this rug looks just great in our living room. I think the colors really are like in the picture here."
5,The best in hardcore horror fiction,"The taboo topics that this book brings up make it uncomfortably gruesome. However, it is amazingly imaginative. I would rate it as the best horror story I've read in decades. By the craftmanship of this novel, I almost suspect it is a pseudonym work of King or Koontz. It may have been too grizzly for their real name."
5,A HAUNTING NIGHTMARE PENNED BY A MASTER!,"This novel is terrifying from beginning to end. Any time your villain is a child possessed by malevolence it makes for a very scary read. If you can get your hands on this, (I personally had a hard time finding a copy), buy it! I promise you that you will not regret it."
5,i really need this book can't find please help!,i really need this book it was excellent the first 30 pages and now i can not find it can you please help! i can't read another book until i find this one!
1,This is not like the picture at all dont waste your money,I ordered this for my boyfriend he is a very big Rusty Wallace and Miller Light Fan. The one I did get was nothing like the pitcure and it is not worth the $106. it cost with shipping. I have tried for two days now to contact someone one this issue and the computers are not letting me send any email and of course there is not a phone number you can call. My advice be very careful of what you order cause there pictures and what you get are not the samething. It is very upsetting to order what you think is the best gift every to find out it is a lesser version then represented and so it is not a great gift after all. Now I have to find something else to get.....in an already stressful time of year we don't need false advertising to ad to it.
3,"Good, but not great","I purchased the Jet slow speed grinder for use in my hobbyist wood shop. The more I work with wood and hand tools, the more I understand the importance of sharp tools. The Jet slow speed grinding system in general works extremely well. The straight edge jig works well for chisels and plane blades when you take the time to set up everything well.My complaint, however, about this jig is that there are plastic O-rings in the base of the jig that register the jig on the support arm so that it is exactly parallel to the grinding wheel. I have had two of these jigs and on both of them , the O-rings (or whatever you call them) have fallen out of the jig. I didn't notice it the first time I used it while sharpening a chisel, which resulted in the jig not registering parallel to the grinding wheel and therefore a sharp chisel with an edge not perpendicular to the shaft of the chisel."
5,Great!,I needed a new strap but I didn't want to pay $20 for one. I saw the ernie ball ones and decided to give it a shot. I'm glad I did. The strap is awesome. It's very very comfortable and can expand longer than any strap I've ever had. It totally deserves 5 stars!
5,nice tighty whiteys,"for the nice clean look for going to church, or every day freakout, this are for you. You might want to be drinking kool aid, might stain the strap, but worth it."
5,A great combination--fine fiction and outstanding history,"In England in 1815, a married woman was ""of one body"" with her husband. They were legally one person, and that person was the man. With drama and passion, Amanda Scott brings that premise to shocking and--to most American women of the 1990's--virtually unimaginable life.Published as a historical romance, this book transcends genre. If you have any interest in women's history of the period, then pick up DANGEROUS ILLUSIONS, and experience not just a great historian, but a true storyteller who knows how to keep you turning the pages right to the very end."
2,Little Style and Less Substance,"While the title may peak your interest, don't sit by your mailbox waiting for enlightenment. This book offers little of value to anyone involved in the computer security field. Frankly it offers little that couldn't be learned from reading the backs of software boxes at your local Fry's or Comp USA. Given the depth of quality recent releases in the field of computer security and high tech investigation and more promising publications on the horizon, it's hard to justify spending the money on this book. Unless you just think the title will look cool on your bookshelf. You'd be better off with any of the recent releases by Eoghan Casey, or Kruse and Heisner. Or you could wait for the upcoming publications by Vacca, and Marcella and Greenfield."
2,Limited Usefulness,"This book is basically an advertisement for software. The book may be helpful to someone who has limited or no experience with computers and the internet. To the investigator, your money would be better spent elsewhere. I found a couple of things useful but overall it was not much use for the ... I spent to purchase it."
3,Not an exact fit for Lexus ES300,"Amazon says this part carries over to my 1995 Lexus ES300, but it is not an exact fit. There is a bracket that supports part of the main wiring harness that is integrated into the base of the Lexus hood strut. I was unable to remove the harness bracket from the blown hood strut, so for now the wire harness had to be zipped tied to keep it in place.Other than the above issue, the instructions on the inside of the box did not correlate in any way shape or form to how my struts connect to my hood.All that aside; the strut is of good quality, and does it's job."
3,StrongArm 4217 L for 91-96 Toyota Camry,"Product is fine and installs easily. However, it does not have a mounting for attaching the windshield wiper cabling like the OEM part."
4,StrongArm 4217L Toyota Camry Hood Lift Support (L),I just replaced the failed hood struts on a 1994 Camry V6 Wagon. The hood doesn't fall on my head when I check the oil. Yay!!! You need this left one 4217L and a left one 4217R for the complete job. The left replacement strut is missing the cable bracket of the original. It supports some wiring which you don't want flopping about. I drilled out the spot welds and knocked the bracket off the old one so I could reuse it with the replacement. These came with replacement brass mounting balls but I chose to leave the originals in place since they didn't seem worn.
2,Elastic rips right out,"Used it once, washed it once, elastic had detatched. Pretty useless all in all. Still looking for something that works well."
2,A good idea...,"I wanted to like this toy. It looked like a lot of fun, and it was educational also. However, after we put it together, it never worked right. We called the company and got a replacement part, and it still didn't work right. I don't know if the problem was a fundamental flaw in the design of the toy, or if we just got a defective one. We returned the product and have not decided whether or not to order another one."
3,disappointing,"I got this for my 25 year old boyfriend. He put it together in about an hour and tested out the different modes. Since you can't program it, he's lost interest."
2,Not so bright,I ordered this light for use in Iraq to spot IEDs so far it is working ok but it is not as bright as I thought it would be. For the money it is ok but I am looking for a brighter light. I dont think it is 2million candel power??????? Still not bad for the money.
3,candle flicker,"Light seems to be well built,but battery does not last long and the trigger button,I think is a waste because if you only want a short burst of light you have to click twice.(once for on,once for off)"
1,Pretty bad.,This light would not charge so it was useless. I got it fairly cheap so it wasn't worth sending it back.
4,very good with a caveat,"The caveat concerns a few HIP swells and slightly overemphatic phrases. I emphasize their relative infrequency. The Prague SO plays beautifully, sounds airy and festive. Movements 2-4, employ a miniature violin concerto. Mozart did likewise in the Serenades #s 3-5 , 7,and 9. Here the violin soloist is Oldrich Vicek who plays with vitality, grace, and tonal sheen.. The outer movements are fairly brisk (an allegro molto in the first movement and an allegro assai in the final movement. The sixth movement Andante is not rushed and is sensitively phrased. The atmosphere is celebratory throughout.The Serenata Notturna is excellent-light and brisk. The solo/ripieno strings (two violin, a viola and a double bass) arejoyful.peers: Haffner Serenade: Kubelik/BRSO (my favorite); Marriner/ASMF/Philips; Munchinger/VPO/Decca; de Waart/Dresden/Decca (lp only)Serenata Notturna: Marriner/ASMF, Klemperer/EMI"
2,Not Basic Administration,"Look closely at the complete title, ""Expert Series"".As beginner to Sybase I was looking for a basic Admin guide, this is not it.It does appear to be well laid out but is geared toward someone with vastly more experience than I presently possess."
5,Almost perfect,"It's almost perfect only because the power of the unit is not as advertised... It's weaker than stated especially when using bounce flash. That said, everything else is SUPER..... ease of use, consistent exposure, build quality, modes, CLS compatibility, it's got it all. GREAT flash!"
5,"Nice flash, unimpressive build quality!","Faster recycle time time than an SB900. Slower user interface. Slightly smaller overall.The SB-800 has been replaced by the SB-900. So if you really want the old item, the SB-800, they are in short supply which explains the high price. Why would you want the old item over the new item? Maybe you have several of the old items and want to have a consistent group of flashes with the same menus and features.In summary, i recommend to anyone in this site that want a nice flash and high quality photo to buy this item."
1,699?!,"I am currently shopping around for this flash and at the time of this review the price is $699.95. That is just ridiculous, as you can get the SB-900 (newer model) for $429 right here on amazon, and almost anywhere else you look, this flash it is in the $300-$400 range. The one star rating has nothing to do with the product itself, I just don't want anyone to get suckered into paying $700 for it."
5,Best iTTL Flash,"Bought one, now have two with remote control. Very versital, a little bit of a learning curve to appreciate what you can accomplish."
1,Watch out,"Excelent flash. Maybe the best in the market for Nikon Digital SLRs....however I suspect it comes with some circuitry project error. Out of the blue my flash stopped working. Sent to repair and was charged $160.00 for it. Suddenly,out of the blue again, I turn it on and few second later the typical smell of a diode encapsulation burning was basking the ambiance!!! As fast as I could, I removed the batteries. I could not hold the batteries in my hands as they were really hot. I opened the flash and yep, the diode was gone....I don't know why but for sure if I have not done anything the whole thing could blow on my face....I don't think it is worthy to spend that much money...as a matter of fact, I bought mine, new,from Photo Alley for $300..."
1,$699!? Is that for a 3-Pack?,That is absolutely rediculous. I assume it's a type-o.I have this flash and enjoy it. Pick one of these up and 2 or 3 sb-600s
5,Good all-round flash,"The SB-800 is everything you can ask for in a general-purpose flash. Lots of candle power with a guide number of 125 at 35mm. The head tilts and swivels for bounce flash. There is also manual, TTL and thyristor operation so that the flash will work with almost any SLR or DSLR with a hot shoe. Of course it works best with Nikon's TTL metering and wireless flash system. Nikon even throws in some filters and a diffuser dome. Price is a bit less than the comparable Metz 58 AF-1."
4,Good buy,"I bought this after struggling to make the SB27 (from my film days) work with Nikon D70. The built in flash served the purpose for casual photos, but left a lot to be desired. This works well and the initial photographs taken in the last one week are wonderful, even closeups.While I did my bit of comparison with SB600, considering my future camera buy probably D200 or later, I felt the investment was good.Recommended."
4,Give it a go,"Right out of the gate, this book is fun. The main character, Annie Kincaid, is likeable, smart and down-to-earth. Her grandfather is a hoot. There are lots of laugh-out-loud moments. From the get-go Annie's life is turned on its ear and it just keeps getting worse. Annie frantically tries to: figure out who killed her friend, not do anything too illegal, stay alive, keep her business, get a straight answer from her grandfather, do her job without revealing its criminal underpinnings, all while trying to deal with two new men in her life, both of whom seem determined to mess with her head, each in his own way. The book has many interesting tidbits about the art world (and forgeries) without getting too involved or detracting from the story. I look forward to the next book, ""Shooting Gallery""."
3,Not what I thought,"I was a little disappointed. I thought this would be a great book. Had trouble staying with it, kept putting down and then coming back to it. I think I excpected more."
3,so bad it's good,This was an Aaron Spelling tv movie from the 70's with an all star cast with the likes of Ray Milland and Stella Stevens. The first forty five minutes were extremely boring. A bunch of dull shallow people aboard a cruise. It felt like a third rate love boat that didn't know where it was going. Then it started to get bad good. Milland finds the Egyptian sarcophagus that he's been looking for his whole life. Only it turns out that it holds the devil. A fanatic priest claims that someone on the boat is the devil's guardian. People start accusing each other and get crazy. Don't get me wrong. This movie is bad. Yet it was enjoyable fluff which is why I gave it a 3.
4,I Like the Old One from Karaoke Machine.,"Hey, I Wanna Buy this one so y'all got a old one instead a new one karaoke machine, GPX C1285 AM/FM Dual Cassette Recorder Karaoke Machine is the new one of the product is from early 1990's but this the New Millenium of the 2000's, y'all can sold and available at Amazon.com store."
2,Disappointing,I am an avid fan of Joanna Trollope but this book was boring and tedious. I couldn't wait to finish it so I could put myself out of my misery. I much preferred A Spanish Lover and The Men and The Girls.
1,The gay love affair in this story did not interest me,"The cover of this book hinted of an affair, but not that it was between two women. I would not have read the book if I had known, because, though I have no problem accepting gay lifestyles, I could not relate to these characters. Also, the main character seemed to just fall into this affair because she was bored with life. This lack of motivation weakened her as a character and made the story less believable."
2,Don't waste your money,"I fortunately checked out this book from the library so I can't complain too much about the price. I read constantly so I thought this book might give me some ideas on some new books to read. I couldn't have been more disappointed. Most of the books suggested are predictable choices - books that most voracious readers read long ago, like ""Gone with the Wind"" or ""Diary of Anne Frank"" to use two examples. I got the impression they were getting kickbacks from bookstores to sell some of these books. Their ""cutesy"" writing gets old after a few chapters and I didn't agree with a lot of their observations. If you can, check this out at the library and wait for someone to write better book selections."
5,Fabulous! Every Book Lover's Best Friend!!!!!!!,"I read voraciously. Classics, new fiction, mysteries, biographies. I love good books. So I'm always looking for new sources of recommendation. I bought this book along with a bunch of classics (Tess of the d'Urbervilles, To the Lighthouse, Complete Jane Austen, and Little Women) with an Amazon gift certificate I received for my birthday. This book is my new best friend. It's a book lover's dream come true. The authors write like girlfriends discussing their favorite books. The books are grouped by theme and each recommendation is followed by a brief synopsis. Book lovers and book groups will find this reference book invaluable and full of inspiration for the next great read. Absolutely one of the best books I've ever bought!"
4,Lots of fun!,"The title says it all! Peske and West ""literally"" cover all phases of our lives from coming of age to business to bad hair, etc. I laughed alot and also reminisced with some of the titles they recommend like ""Born Free"" (located in the mid-life crisis section). Although I am an avid reader, I was not even familiar with many of the titles which was refreshing.Filled with nuggets of wisdom and funny quotes, there are reviews and quirky tales to go along with the selected titles. Definitely a good reference book when you are looking for something different."
4,Handy tool to have,"This tool is easy to use. The motot came loose at the base on mine. It was an easy fix, but to someone with out small engine repair training, it would've cause alot of problems. Easy to use and digs through soil without a problem. Used it to dig a ditch 37 feet long and two feet deep."
3,"troy-built 144r is excellent,,butttt","my experience is that thee starting assembly is cheap...i had trouble from the get go with the starter...sometimes the starter won't catch,,,frustrating....got to be a saturday mechanic to keep it running...now i have trouble on accelleration which i'm trying to figure now..also at times the on off switch won't shut off the engine...great machine and i love the power and work it is capable of doing for a small machine..had the thing running only a few hours though...it does need reengineering on the things i mentioned..i would take it in for repairs but it is a hassle...i could have sent it back then i'd have no machine and lose shipping cost.."
1,Great Toy if that is what you want,"The shaft broke, less than 3 hours on machine. My soil bed has very few rocks and it took less time to just shovel till the ground. What a piece of junk."
2,Poor design,I purchased the Troy-Bilt 4-Cycle 1.1 HP Gas Cultivator #144R because it was advertised to be a cultivator/edger. My power edger had just broke and I needed to replace it and I also needed cultivator. That was a mistake!The edger does not work as well as a standard edger. I later purchased an edger.The cultivator on the other hand works well. However the start cord does not retrieve/rewind without continuous help. The back wheels are attached rather loosely and make the cultivator hard to tow from job to job.
5,Dirt Eating Cultivator,"The producr came in non-operating order. It had to be fixed before I could use it. The company that sold it is still, one month later not adjusting the price of the item from NEW to USED!I would not recommend the company 1outdoorstore@gmail.com."
1,Bad case design,"The second time I tried to use this the pull start handle holder rattled loose and the nut that held it sheared all the teeth off the flywheel. The rest of it may be rock solid but, the choice to hold the pull start handle up there in that way was a poor choice.Do yourself a favor if you buy one of these take the handle holder off before it rattles off. Its not necessary anyway."
1,Bad Buy,"Worst piece of equipment I've ever owned. Bought for light duty use, I have a full size tiller for heavy jobs. Engine dropped a valve in 15 minutes of use and locked up. Poor customer service and parts were back ordered for 3 months."
1,Pure Junk,"Purchased in early April of 2006 due to alledged quality of brand name and it's been in the service center virtually ever since. First time after 1/2 hour of operation the starter wouldn't engage. Had it repaired (mechanic said the starter was of extemely poor design). Another 1/2 hour of operation same problem. Had it repaired ran it about 3/4 hour and it began spewing oil everywhere. It took at least 5 weeks to get the determination that it was not repairable (so much for early gardening season. Now Troy-bilt refuses to refund my money, they just want me to accept another machine.My advice is stay away. Troy-Bilt isn't apparently what they used to be since being acquired by MTD."
1,Poor starter design,"Sadly we did no research before buying, relying on the Troybilt name...I got this in June 2008 - it's now mid July 2008 and I've had this in the shop 3 times for repairs to the starter system. Most recently the repair shop completely replaced the starter system - I picked it up Saturday and I'm on my way back today (Wednesday) because - again - the starter line is not engaged and so the thing can't be started. When it works, it's great, lightweight, just the thing for my raised bed gardens. Sadly the reliability is very poor. Reading through the reviews I see a number of others have had similar problems. Would not recommend this unit."
1,Troy built name is tarnished,"After using an old troy built horse for years I had to choose between mantis and troy built for a small tiller. I chose troy built because of the name. Immediately the transmission gear tore up. It was fixed for free (after driving about 80 miles) and very soon was broke again with the same problem. Pieces broke off or fell off, it is now collecting dust in my storage building. The people that repaired it also rented tools and said they recommended mantis because they did not break as easily as the troy built."
1,Junk,This item is complete junk. First one crapped out in <12 months. Company sent new replacement after long hassle. This one died in < 1 year also. Now not under warranty. Took it to repair shop and they told me it isn't worth it to try to repair it.
1,Add me to the long list of dissatisfied users,"Add me to the list of unsatisfied users that had their Troy Bilt Tiller break on them. For me it lasted 3 seasons. Sorry, but I can't justify $100/season for very light duty tilling of my vegetable garden each spring. For this price you should expect 8-10 years of use, not 3.Troy-Bilt should have a class action levied against them for unloading this heap of garbage onto American consumers. As someone else here said, I'll check out the Mantis tillers next season."
1,Junk,"This is one of the worst machines I have ever operated. I should have known there was trouble when the instructions told me to prime the engine a ridiculous amount of times. Not only is this a hard starting machine cold, warm it's even harder. And then to top it all off, the third time I used this cultivator (on a garden that has been tilled twice a year for four years) it ate up the drive gear. I have less than three hours on it and it's headed for the curb with the rest of the garbage."
1,"Sappho, the tenth muse is a difficult book to read.","Freedman's novel reads like non-fiction. 99% of her extensive research appears to have found it's way onto the pages. Within the first 20 pages, Freedman offers a child abuse excuse for The Poetesses later fascination with her own gender. And, in these same 20 pages, Sappho is seen drooling over a collection of muscles and external genitalia with little brains who will eventually exile her from her home. To make matters worse, Freedman ends with the apocraphal story of Sappho and Phaeon (a fiction fabricated by Ovid for the amusement of Rome) For those of us who love The Lesbian, this novel will bring pain, sorrow and little enjoyment. This is not a book I would recommend to lesbians or feminists."
2,"High hopes, low fulfillment","Since I've always been fascinated with Sappho, I was excited when I came across this book. What a disappointment. The writing is sketchy and unfleshed. The plot seems like little more than an excuse to show Sappho lusting after everyone she comes into contact with. I never thought I'd say this, but I actually got tired of lesbian sex scenes. Worst of all, the character of Sappho herself never becomes real or sympathetic. I had high hopes for this book, and it didn't come close to fulfilling them. There are good points (interweaving of poetry into the text, details of ancient Greek culture, some intriguing insights) but they are far outweighed by bad ones."
4,"PBO of the continuation of ""Mr. Roberts""","I knew what I was getting when I ordered this paperback original. I had just finished the biography of Tom Heggen and Ross Lockridge called ""Tom and Ross "" In ""Tom and Ross "" I learned that Tom Heggen killed himself because he could not write another book. Maybe he should have followed the lead of the author of this PBO, continue the story from Mr. Roberts. This book is easy to read and does continue the story started in Mr. Roberts. If you like the original book , you will be entertained by ""Ensign Pulver""."
4,slow but gratifying,"Having read some of the other reviews of this clanbook i have to agree that yes it did take me longer to read this one than some of the other ones. And in places i did seem to get confuised as to what was actually going on but i found that the Inquisitor's and templars represented here show a great aspect of the Dark Ages game. I for one am going to try and pick up a copy of Dark Ages Inquistor at the first possible oppertunity after reading this book. You wont find any deep insight to the workings of the clan in this book cuz well i dont think that as a clan they are organised enough and Zoe is a rather uneducated ravnos fledgling, at least shes not as annoying in this book and has grown up a bit."
5,Best Battle Sequences & It's In HD 5.1!!!,"Fictional or not the setting takes place in one of the most pivotal moments in not only American History, but in World History!"
5,Connecting Across Differences,"Basic concepts covered in Marshall Rosenbergs' book on Nonviolent Communication are given a much broader discussion in Connecting Across Differences. That met my need for a deeper understanding of NVC. There were also more exercises in the book for opportunities to test my understanding of the practice of communicating nonviolently.This is not another communications-theories book. I found it to be a practical guide to improving interpersonal communications and mediating conflict in my life--at work and at home; with loved ones, colleagues, and even with strangers.I highly recommend this book for those interested in inproving the quality of their life through greater connection and more meaningful interaction with the people in their lives."
5,A great many needs met; highly recommended,"I have had the great joy of many learning needs met by reading Connecting Across Differences.I really love how the teaching is incremental and there are integrating exercises at each step. I love how it meets my need for humour along with learning. I love that it meets my need for intellectual stimulation by giving consideration to some of the theoretical implications and philosophical underpinnings of the NVC process. And finally, I truly appreciate what I see as an awareness of justice issues on the parts of the authors as they present ""life situations"" as fodder for their learning activities. IOW I love the content to which they have chosen to apply the NVC process for learning purposes because it meets my needs for connection, understanding, healing, fairness, clarity and on and on.I can't recommend this book highly enough.Shulamit DayNVC Trainer Certification candidateOttawa, ON, Canada"
4,The Best Ever,"This could be the best overall recording of these two Mozart symphonies ever. It is definitely, hands-down, the best recording of the Prague anywhere on the planet. This is, to date, the only recording of the Prague symphony I've ever heard that doesn't sound pathetically anemic; it displays the fiery energetic passion for which Mozart should be better known. The Linz is similarly well-recorded; the technique of the musicians (particularly on the string passages in the Finale) is beyond reproach. If only the orchestra had had the heart to take the first movement of the Linz at a quicker tempo, this could be a five-star album. As it stands, this album is barely lacking in any area. Definitely a good buy."
5,good alternative,"mackerras is a good alternative to the big band readings of bohm, walter, etc. the prague orchestra plays with light, chamber orchestra-like textures that work well for mozart. as expected, the tempos are brisk and the music - especially the outer movements - is exciting. but the thing that surprised me was the slow movements. i've always found mozart's slow movements to be a little dull, but this disc opened my eyes to their beauty. maybe it was the faster tempos that did it. a good disc. highly recommended."
3,Rather mechanic,"I bought this cd for the Prague. To my ears, Beecham, Bernstein, Klemperer, and even the rather sentimental Maag sound more interesting (I haven't yet tried Walter). Maybe I just have different taste to the other reviewers' (I bought this cd after reading their reviews), but I suppose it's always good to compare different recordings before making a purchase (Berstein's is quite cheap too)."
4,Excellent EM Primer!,"As a new disaster director, this is a very useful tool in understanding how a disaster unfolds, and the subsequent response and management that occur. Mr. Alexander provides plenty of real-life examples of disasters to demonstrate the EM principles. The book is more focused on domestic responses in the U.S. than to the international arena."
1,It Stopped Working!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"First of all I barely used this phone. Had it plugged in about 3 times. This last time when I needed it for a job, due to the headset capability, it wouldn't work.Got a dial tone, no numbers would print digitally, and no numbers would dial when I pressed the buttons. I wish Amazon wouldn't sell this product and wish I had read the reviews prior to buying it.The phone was ordered at the end of Oct 2008. It's now April 2009. Fourth time I've used the phone.Don't waste your moneyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy. My rating is -5 stars but there was no option for it."
5,gift for wife,My Wife was very pleased with the watch.Very good quality. Would reccomend to future buyers.
3,Good but could be better,"Ok the movie was good, but it left you wanting more. By more I wish they would have developed the characters a little more. You didn't really get to know them, it felt as though you were walking up to a conversation that has been in process for a while. It takes you a while to catch up and know what is going on. The acting is phenomenal since they do eventually get you to know these people well enough to know they are one hell of a group. They are capable of showing their love for one another with out actually saying it. Like I said good acting."
2,"Too slow, fast forwarded through most of it",The pace was really slow and not engaging. I didn't find the characters or acting compelling and got bored. Ended up fastforwarding to the end. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone for any reason.
1,This was truly a bad movie,"Perhaps there were some deep themes in this movie, but it was painful to watch. None of the characters made me like them which is saying a lot since I was always a Katie Holmes fan. I suppose that's how the world is - no one is perfect, but these people weren't even likeable. It's definitely not a comedy, and not particularly romantic."
3,Huh?,The characters were interesting but I wish the plot had been more developed. The movie had parts that seemed to go on forever and the ending was very unclear.
2,The potential was there...,"So the movie offers the build of a great story and an exceptional cast of characters, however it's like all set up and no follow through. The ending seems like it's the middle of the scene and while a great many things happen they don't tie together or make much sense beyond the idea that the characters are truly messed up."
1,Empty story about empty people doing nothing,"I hope the writers were not from Yale, as some of the characters supposedly are. If this is the level of intelligence that now characterizes Yale students, then the school should probably just close. I've seen several old-friends-get-together movies over the decades. This might be the worst. These are empty people with no understanding of life or themselves. They reveal this fact in most uninteresting ways. Not worth watching at all, not even with beer and popcorn."
2,Dissapointing,There isn't much of a plot to the movie. Great actors but not a great movie. Also it seemed like time was wasted by showing scenery
3,Don't expect a lot,"From many of the reviews here, I didn't expect a lot, and I wasn't disappointed in that regard. I expected more from some noted actors, but sadly, all I keep coming back to is the disappointment. The only good thing I can really say is that I saw it for free, with my Prime membership.The setting/scenery was beautiful, the music was good, but the plot left a LOT to be desired. I think the most interesting part was a confrontation between the bride-to-be and the maid of honor, just before the wedding, near the end of the movie. But to get to that decent part, you had to suffer through the rest first. I think what disturbed me most was the ending. Or lack thereof. All of a sudden, the screen went black, and the credits started to roll. I just went ""huh?! Then what happened?"" But there wasn't any more. That was all there was.I've seen much better, but it's not the worst I've seen. If you don't expect a lot going in, then you might not be be disappointed. Sadly, I was."
3,After reuniting for a wedding a group of college friends try to keep secrets from the bride. Plot has been overdone. I say C+,"A group of old college friends reunite for a wedding. The maid of honor (Holmes) and the groom Tom (Duhamel) are still not sure that thier relationship is over. After the worst sequence of wedding toasts ever during the rehearsal dinner Tom disappears and Laura finds him and the begin to talk about thier feelings. The other members of the wedding party are all looking for Tom and trying to keep the bride (Anna Paquin) from discovering what is going on. This is another plot that has been done to death. The cast and acting are enough to keep you watching and entertained but the writing really hurt this one. I can't go farther without giving the movie away, but watch it and you will see what I mean. I give it a C+.Would I watch again? - I don't think I would"
3,"Interesting story of pre-wedding conflicts, not necessarily resolved","This movie isn't so bad as some are making it out to be. It was adapted from a novel and is about a group of college buddies who gather together when two are about to get married. Ah, but the bride's best friend is still in love with the groom, and he may have some feelings that linger for her as well. Therein lies the big conflict.The others spend most of the night before the wedding getting drunk, reminiscing, arguing, etc. Most of the arguing takes place between the aforementioned former lovers, of course.So....do things get resolved and does the wedding take place? It is hard to say, given the ambiguous ending."
1,Just plain bad,"There wasn't much to like about this film. It was like watching a poorly written high school stage drama. Bad acting from normally pretty good actors, No sense of character development.The characters are completely unlikable. It was hardly funny and boringly predictable. It could have been a good or even great film if they focused on the awkwardness of the situation or some sort of revenge plan, but this film maintained its blandness for a full hour and a half. Don't waste your time."
1,Awful,"Awful... that's all there is to it. Good idea, weirdly put together. There's an argument scene that lasts at least half the movie and the ending is just odd. The only entertaining part was the fight between the bride and maid of honor. Everything else didn't seem to fit and was randomly thrown in."
1,Huh?,"Having read the reviews, my expectations were not high when it came to watching this film. However, I found myself enjoying it. I thought it moved at a good pace, the group was delightfully dysfunctional, and Katie Holmes and Anna Paquin were great - especially the scene right before the wedding. BUT it didn't have an ending!!!! I was left hanging and that totally sucks!!!! Love the soundtrack but having watched it all the way through, I feel SO CHEATED!"
3,Cute Little Movie,The Romantics is a very interesting idea. Some of it is very poorly done. I'd say it's more of a drama. Some funny moments but very scattered.
1,Young 'adults' behaving badly,"A group of college friends gather for the wedding of two of the group and regress to their worst 'college' behaviors; excessive drinking, drug abuse, skinny-dipping,etc. They're supposed to be TEN YEARS out of college, but have the selfishness/self-absorbsion/lack of impulse control of a group of 18 year-olds. I didn't even care if they went through with the wedding and turned this off."
2,"Bad, bad, bad!!",Let's talk about the good. The kissing scene between Josh and Katie...most of the soundtrack. Maybe the book is better?
1,Drab! Dreary! Dreadful!,"My title says it all, I kept watching hoping, praying it would get better. It only got worse. Wish I read the reviews before I purchased it. Save your $ and your time, do not watch this."
3,ok,"Just ok, not much of a real story line and kind of drawn out. I would not recommend it. So glad I didn't pay to see this in the theater."
1,Slow and boring,I kept waiting for something big to happen. It wasn't until the end when some things started but then it was over. I wouldn't recommend this movie.
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"Because of the famous actors like Candice Bergen, Katie Holmes, I had high hopes for this movie. I wish I had read the other reviews first. It was difficult to follow and the ending unsatisfactory in that it did not leave me with any sort of closure."
2,"Promising cast, movie viewing let-down","I was so excited about the cast in this movie, I thought it would be entertaining at least....but I was horribly bored at the beginning and then it finally started to pique my interest but it was short-lived. I felt the movie was a waste of time and I cant believe that these actors and actresses appeared in it. I really was hoping for much better...I gave the two stars just for the awesome cast!"
1,So slow,"This film is very slow, dull, hard to watch and monotonous. Don't bother. The cast all stepped down for this one."
5,"For the true Romanticists, not Romantics.","Look, this is called the Romantics, but it's not your ""Notebook"" kind of romance. If you've studied the actual Romanticists, then you'll enjoy this. It's a post-modern story, so yes, the ending seems strange or premature, but that's what po-mo is all about! Life continues, it doesn't just end when the movie ends. The best way to enjoy this movie is to understand all of these things and to pay attention to character building and filming. And yes, the soundtrack is amazing."
1,LAME,"This movie was trying to be The Big Chill meets St. Elmo's Fire and didn't succeed! Remember the scene in the old 80's movie where the guy holds up the boom box (forgot the name), well, the part where the Duhanel holds up his cell phone and ran out to Kattie Holmes about put me over the edge...lame, lame, lame. It was a train wreck from beginning to end. Very surprised such a bad movie attracted such powerhouse actors - YIKES!"
1,My eyes hurt...1 stars seems too good for this movie.,This movie was so bad that my eyes started hurting...I honestly couldn't believe how bad this was. A lot of completely pointless seens and dialogue. This move was lost from start to finish. I honestly don't understand how it was ever put out.
3,anti climatic,"this movie has some good actors in it but it is not a great film. It's somewhat entertaining. I like the concept and there are some really good moments but the ending is aniti climatic. sure, watch it if there isn't anything else to do."
4,Better than I expected!,"I'm not a fan of romantic comedies but really like Anna Paquin & Josh Duhamel...also Katie Holmes so I bought this movie. I was pleasantly surprised that it was more comedy than romance. The friends that meet together for the wedding are the type of friends I think everyone wished they had. They make the movie lively and really seem to have a bond. It almost felt like a TV show, because by the end, I wanted to keep following their lives (imo, I think it would make a great series). Somehow after all these years after Dawson's Creek, Katie Holmes seemed to be playing the same part, (with the addition of cursing). I don't think the movie was meant to convey any meaning, but from what I got out of it was if you're young, friends and in love, there's no rush to get married. It adds extra stress to what could be a beautiful relationship."
3,Enjoyed the idea,"Were there flaws and chilliness in this movie yes, but I can imagine what it had hoped to be and read between the lines. The music, actors and scenary were worth the 96 minutes of this movie. I enjoyed it!"
1,NOT a comedy,"I like Katie Holmes, and was in the mood for a romantic comedy, so I thought I'd check this out. I'm not sure why this is listed as ""comedy"" at all. There's nothing funny in it . . . unless you find misery, betrayal and tragedy to be funny."
4,"It is the only recording I have heard except on the radio, and it is beautiful!","The only thing that could be improved is the recording level which had to be turned way up to hear it on my Bose, but it never got too loud."
3,"The Faure is Great, Not so Much the Durufle","The Faure Requiem (Op. 48) in D minor is a soft, gentle requiem unlike the powerful Verdi, Berlioz, and Durufle. The delicate qualities of this requiem are captured beautifully on this recording.The Durufle Requiem (Op. 9) is one of my most favorite compositions of all time and it is not performed well on this disc for one reason: the solos are sung by the choir and that is not what I want to hear when I want to hear Durufle's requiem. Piquemal's version is still my favorite and I recommend that over this one."
2,Chip Fails after only one year!,"After owning this unit for 16 months, during which time it worked fine, a chip went bad causing horrible static and buzz which rendered the unit unusable; the service people indicated there was no fix other than paying big bucks to have it fixed while I would be without a phone for a month. PLANNED OBSOLESCENCE -- I do NOT recommend this product. For [money], it should have worked longer than 16 months."
1,Does not work out of the box,"I had problems within a week of buying this product. When the phone rings, the answering machine mysteriously loses power. The in use button goes off and the machine refuses to answer calls. I checked the documentation and this scenerio is not covered. I would avoid this answering machine at all costs."
1,Very Expensive Answering Machine!,"I LOVED this phone at first then within 6 months there was so much static on the handset that we can't use it. I am glad I read that this is a common problem here before we went and bought the... replacement battery.Also, you really have to keep the manual because nothing is simple."
2,Disappointed,"I was (and still will am since I've returned the phone) looking for a high quality speaker phone with a good range of operation for my home business. The phone is not intuitive to use (e.g. if you type in a wrong number, it's not obvious where the backspace button is, mute?). The receiver is awkward, heavy (compared to the Siemens model)and the notion that I'd have to replace the batteries at some point make this a return."
1,Application Caution,"This phone seems to be hypersensitive to outside interference. To its credit, there is not a problem when the unit is in use and the clarity and sound quality are excellent. However, when the unit sits or is charging, 'Out of Range' conditions have occured requiring a complete power disconnect to fix. According to Panasonic customer service, something is interrupting the phone- to-base signal. My unit is currently at the repair center and its less than 90 days old."
1,Disapointed,"Phone had great features,enough that I bought 2 of them. Over time, one stopped working totally, after gradual disintegrating sound quality.The other one gets so bad that I have to switch phones to hear the person i'm speaking to.The funny thing is, the phone that we switch to is an old 900mhz Panasonic."
1,I too have experienced the pain...,"If you see a pattern in the reviews of this machine, believe it.I own this unit and the reviews of it here are accurate. After a year of ownership, my ""out of range"" problem occurs in about 1 of every 10 uses. In addition, the phone does generate more static over time, rendering a normal conversation quite difficult. Further, a large majority of people I talk with claim that my phone makes my voice sound very quiet. Finally, the phone is awkward to hold during a long conversation.There are good points. The answering machine is nice and relatively easy to use. That's pretty much it.Conclusion: I got suckered by the good looks of this machine. Believe me and everybody else here when we tell you that no matter how good it looks, the unit is not reliable."
1,Horrible!!,"I had a simple objective when purchasing my last cordless phone: clear and reliable operation. Unfortunately, I was lured by the good reputation of Panasonic and assumed their top-of-the-line model would fit the bill, especially given the high price.I was terribly disapointed. The phone is only 6 months old, and it is now totally useless. I usally can not create a connection between the handset and the base, and if I can, the audio is so bad the phone is useless. I REALLY feel ripped off.Panasonic has really done itself a great disservice to its brand reputation. I would strongly recommend against this purchase."
2,Performance wears off...,"I bought this phone a few months ago from an office store. It worked very well the first couple of months. I then began to get some out of range signals, even though being just a few feet away from the base. Now, the out of range signals haven't increased as I've read in other reviews, but the sound quality decreased by about 50% along with much static when walking, to the point that I feel I need a new phone. I don't think it's Panasonic that is to blame here, but rather the 2.4GHz technology. So I will not get another 2.4GHz phone. Also, the ear piece is somewhat too open and it becomes difficult to maintain a conversation if your immediate environment gets noisy. I rate it two stars because I liked the design of that phone and it worked fairly well for six months. I do not wish to deal with their customer service because I have no time.I hope this helps some of you."
2,no more display,"The phone looks good, and has a long range.BUT, you always need the user guide because the interface is not intuitive at all. And worst, there are technical problems:I had trouble with caller ID so I had to return the phone.The display on the handset is dead, after less than a year."
1,Legal Action,"I was duped into thinking Panasonic manufactured quality phones as well. 6 months later it was completely dead - out of range messages, and extreme static/buzzing. After numerous calls to Panasonic and angry letters, the best they could offer was a new model I could purchase for $50 in return for my silence (to which I obviously declined). With the number of horrible complaints they've received, I'm surprised that no one has threatened a class action lawsuit. Any lawyers out there interested?"
1,Worthless Product,"I have owned this product only for it to spend more time in the Panasonic repair center than in my home. After 4 times of being returned to me, the product still doesn't work. Panasonic stated they would replace the phone if I CALL their repair center to get a copy of the repair history. I CALLED the repair center and they stated the only repair record they keep is the last repair.I have spent more money on this phone in shipping and batteries than I did on the actual product... Please avoid Panasonic."
1,Noisy Handset and Persistent Out of Range Errors,"I have only had this phone for 6 months and it is constantly giving me out of range errors even when I am at my desk and the base is only 1 foot away!Also, the handset is very noisy, so much so that I have to switch to the intercom to understand anything. At first I thought it was my phone line, but I tried my phone line with other phones and it sounded fine.Bad phone. I am very dissappointed with Panasonic. I am usually a fan of theirs with 3 TVs and a DVD player by them that I love, but I will be hesitant to buy another phone from them."
2,A bad product with a Brand Name,"I bought this phone just six months ago and paid [alot]. For first two months the performance was good. No problem at all. Third month onward the handset started showing ""Out of range error"" even though the handset was at 1 feet distance from the base unit. But with few retries, it was working. Fourth month onward, we started getting frequent ""Out of range"" errors and some noise disturbance while talking. Today, 90% of time, it shows ""Out of range"" and if it is in range, caller-id doesn't work and even if caller-id do work, you still can't hear from the other side, because of extreme noise disturbance. The blue-color scroll button also stopped working and doesn't scroll any numbers and again shows the same error ""Out of range"".Wasted a lot money, just because of brand-name. We switched back to our regular phone with caller-id."
3,"ok, but just ok","i bought this phone after i bought the siemens gigaset. it took three days to decide to return the panasonic. (making it somewhat better than the siemens.LOL!) it just wasn't very good. the sound of the phone was only average and the speaker on the answering maching was distorted. there's no back up batery so if there's an outage you can't use it and will lose your excisting messages. my headset sounded awfull on it. i bought the undiden exr 2480 after this phone. it's two way 2.4 ghz transmition makes it the clearest cordless i've ever heard. but again, the speaker on the answering machine is junk. i think i'll take that one back and keep my old one till something truely good comes out. good luck!"
1,The computer wiz,"It worked fine for about year, and as soon as its warranty is over, static has come into the handset! The manual says to push a button to choose a different channel, but it does not work!"
1,Piece of junk and poor service,"Shortly after one year the phone developed such load static that we could not hear the callers. Sent to Panasonic Service which proved to be inept, indifferent, and discourteous. Took the Service Center two months to charge me a $25 service fee, neglected to do anything to the phone, then sent it back to me. When questioned, the Service people were rude and when asked to explain, hung-up on me. I cancelled the $25 credit card charge, wrote the company giving the sequence of events and stating that I will never purchase a Panasonic product again. Never heard back from them. Their loss!"
1,Piece of Junk,"Like most of the reviews I have read, I also see that I bought a lousy product. Like most I was suckered in by the looks and the new technology of the 2.4ghz phone. My phone lasted about one year when the out of range messages started appearing as well as the loud buzzing in the handset. My brother also bought the same phone with the same problems after six months. What seems obvious from most of the reviews as well as brother's and my own experience, is that this product is defective and Pansonic should be forced into a total recall with either replacement working phones or give everyone who bought this product all of our money back."
2,Great while it works,"The phone provides a number of good features, primarily the extended range which gives great reception with little interference or fading. The hand set is extremely sturdy as the edges are encased in rubber which allows it to bounce back from drops of several feet. The speakerphone provides true duplex with very good quality.Now for the negatives: The microphone on the handheld distorts speech and numberous callers have complained about our muffled voices. The Answering system and phone commnands (such as directory) are complicated and time consuming to set up and difficult to access. I also question the quality of the phone. I used a headset with the phone and after 5 months of use, the connector for the headset started getting intermittent and then stopped working all together. Also, the microphone on the handset now work intermittently. I expect a phone to work for longer than 8 months. I'm going out to buy a new phone today. Definitey; will not be a Panasonic!"
2,"NICE FEATURES, POOR QUALITY","This phone has great features, caller ID, answering machine, ect. But the quality IS THE WORST. I am standing right next to the base and it will say, ""out of range"". Happens numerous times! Sound is clear at times, but at other times the sound will cut in and out. I have a better connection using my cellphone. I'm looking for another phone right now to replace this one. I just can't use it anymore!!"
1,Pricey and poor quality - lost confidence in Panasonic,"Hi,I've had this phone for about 3 years now... Its been quite unreliable.The phone went ""OUT OF RANGE"" after about 6 months of buying it. It became unusable. Went to the Panasonic service center and got it repaired under warranty. The service person told me that the problem is VERY COMMON for this model. He said that there is a faulty chip or something and after repairs it will not have problems.But after a few months after repairs, the ""OUT OF RANGE"" kept happening. But now, it has become much worse and the handset hardly ever picks up when there is an incoming ring. There is also so much static that its become unusable.I've lost confidence in Panasonic after this product (Made in Japan) and I am considering other brands as replacement."
1,Avoid it,"I too have this ""out of range"" problem after about one year of use. I e-mailed Panasonic Customer Service twice about this problem and have received no reply at all. I finally got fed up with this junk and bought a Uniden 2.4 GHz phone (TRU4485-2) to replace it, and the Uniden has no problem at all. So the problem is NOT because of the increase use of wireless network as one of the reviewers claimed. ""Made in Japan"" is not necessarily good. This is definitely one of my worst purchases in my life. And I will never ever purchase any Panasonic product."
1,Died after 1 year,"I thought this phone worked pretty well when we first got it, but the longer we had it, the less we liked it. The reception is good, but that's just about the only positive thing about it. First of all, we lost the manual when we moved and it's just about impossible to figure out how to use any of the features, even just setting the time and date is difficult. Secondly, when you listen to your messages and you want to return a phone call, the answerer shuts off as soon as you turn the phone on. So if someone left a number to return their call, you need to write it down first and then turn the phone on to call. And thirdly, after a year of use, we're getting this ""out of range"" message almost every time we try to make a call, even then we're right next to the phone. I've had Panasonic phones in the past that have lasted over 5 years, but this one is a big disappointment, especially for the price. We're changing to Uniden phones which tend to work well and get good ratings."
2,Have to replace in less then 2 years,"I got this phone in November 2000. The design and features are great. The only thing that I missed is ability to use speed-dial buttons - you always have to go through a directory. The range and clarity were pretty good in the beginning.Then several months ago it just started deteriorate. I have to say that I didn't really take good care of the phone. But then LCD screen became loose, some buttons became a bit sticky and, most important, voice became garbled. The called would hear me fine, but I can barely make out what they're saying.It's sad to replace this phone, but I'm going to give Uniden a try now."
5,EXCELLENT PHONE!!! Please read if you are looking 4 the phon,"This phone is really really good. Excellent phone for the price. May be it's too early to tell but so far I like it so much that I recommend it to everyone.I saw all the bad reviews about this phone and some had problem after few months and a year or so but I think no offense but it's not the phone it's you and how you take care of the phone or any electronic items. I am the big time fan of electronics and I love to buy them and try everything out.THIS IS THE BEST PHONE SO FAR I HAVE BOUGHT. You know, I looked at all the reviews and they were for Black version of this phone. The one I have is the Silver one and is THE BEST by LOOK and QUALITY.Thanks,Raj"
5,Great phone; just keep it clean.,"I've owned the 2570 for 3 or 4 years and find the sound quality and signal strength are great. I recharge the handset only sporadically but have never had a problem with the battery.Every few months the handset displays an ""out-of-range"" message which prevents making a call. I finally figured out that this simply means the phone needs to be cleaned. The remedy is to wipe-off the base and handset with a slightly damp clean cloth; then the phone works fine. I live in a city where the air is dirty.What would improve this phone? A stronger backlight on the phone and base displays; a speakerphone option on the handset (it's awkward as currently designed); and longer lasting numbers and letters on the handset - they are beginning to wear-off.What do I really like about it? The voice clarity; the rubber grips along the sides of the handset that make it comfortable to hold and prevents slipping; and the overall quality."
4,Its a pretty good phone!!!,"The Panasonic KXTG2570B is a pretty good phone overall. Panasonic has some great features on it. The features include; caller ID; Digital Answering Machine; Remote Access; and the idea of being shockproof, and water resistant. The phone isn't for everyone though. The reason for this is because other items, such as the microwave (which uses the same 2.4 GHz signal) can interfere with the phone signal. Recommendations are to keep the base unit away from the microwave or any such items. I have the KXTG2570B, and I haven't had problems with it."
4,Few few problems,"I've had this phone for about 2 years now and I haven't had any problems with it. The only problem that I am experiencing now, is that the battery doesn't hold a charge for anything longer than 20 minutes of talk time. Which, I understand, is normal of batteries. I've never had the ""out of range"" problem or anything like that. Of course, I do live in a semi small town in Iowa and not a remotely large city. So I have very little that would interfere with the phone."
2,Didn't Last....,"I bought this phone (not from Amazon) less than a year ago and recently it has begun to badly malfunction. I get severe static moments into any call, and the static simply gets worse during a call. Also, it now loses its connection with the base unit on about a third of attempts--even when I hold the handset directly beside the base! I get the message ""out of range"" in these cases. So, I'm here to buy another phone and would suggest you pass on this one."
1,Nice for the first couple of months,"This phone is great in theory. After a couple of months, everything falls apart. I've read the other reviews and all complaints are consistent with my experience. I've owned my phone for less than a year and I'm throwing it in the trash. The range deteriorates with time and I often receive ""out of range"" warnings, even when standing next to the base. The sound is distorted and at times I hear nothing but static.I don't have time to go into detail, but this is the WORST phone I have ever purchased. You'd be better of with the $10 special from Radio Shack."
3,"Good phone, but curious mix of features","This is a good phone, but it is curiously missing some features that are standard in cheaper phones. No redial button, no selection of ringer sounds, and the built-in directory is clumsy. If you have caller ID, a light on the base unit blinks continuously, forever, until you review the caller ID list on the handset. Overally I'm satisfied because of the sound quality (A+) and the ergonomics of the handset. But it's definitely not the epitome of cordless phones."
1,Out-Of-Range and Out-Of-Patience,"I too have fallen victim of the infamous ""out of range"" problem. I paid the extra bucks for this crummy thing because I didn't want the hassle of an inferior phone. It just goes to show - you don't always get what you pay for. In addition to this complaint, my other pet peeves about this phone are: 1) the fake silver coating rubs off the handset turning the once metalic-looking object into an wornout-looking piece of garbage with spots of cheap-looking plastic showing through; 2) the display screen gets all greasy from being pressed against your face, forcing you to wipe it off before/after every use; 3) the rubber protective strip below the ear piece rubs off on every surface you place it down on, producing black scuff marks all over the house.Needless to say, my next phone will not be Panasonic."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!,"The phone failed after 13 months of use. It is HORRIBLE now, and virtually unusable. The product should be recalled. HORRIBLE PHONE!"
1,Disrupts WiFi Networks Too,"I agree with the other negative comments about how confusing this phone is to use, and how it has mediocre (at best) sound quality. But, the most serious problem for me is that every time someone uses it, it completely disrupts my wireless network. So if you're using 802.11b, stay away from this phone."
2,Poor sound quality and battery life,"I chose this 2.4Ghz phone + answering machine + caller ID for its features, and found that though everything worked, they didn't work very well. Like other users, I found the menu system difficult to use. The sound quality was marginal and wasn't even as good as my 900mhz phones from other manufacturers. On top of that, the battery started dying about 4 months after I purchased the phone. It can no longer maintain a charge. The same poor sound quality also exists on the answering machine, making messages difficult to hear."
2,lemon,"I'm a computer tech, and home tech. Utilizing home automation products, so I'm very competent with using home electronics. Fact is that after 1 year or so, started developing static/noise on the line, progressively getting worse. Constant out of range messages, as well as no talk activation. Called Panasonic said it was cheaper to replace the phone than repair it. If I could purchase the board they explain that goes bad I would replace it. People that haven't experienced problems got the good ones. Before the 1 year phone worked great. So the people not experiencing problems should not critic the ones that got stuck with the lemons. Pansonic lost me as a future customer, and a class-action suit should come forth."
2,Excellent range and clarity...,"I have owned this phone for 7 months, and the one thing I'm very impressed with is the clarity, which is the best I have ever had in a cordless.This phone also features a large oval button which you scroll either up/down, or right/left, for many of the functions. The one I like and find easy to use is scanning to see who has phoned you. The name and phone numbers are displayed very nicely and easy to read.What I do not like about this phone (and why I rate it 2 stars)is having to get out the owners manual every time I need to change something. Setting the time is a nightmare. Something as basic as turning off your phone's ringer is a project!And the very basic 're-dial' function we all know, is lost on this phone because you need to get out the manual to find the program to do it! VERY frustrating.What could have been a great phone is nothing more than an over-done, complicated mess."
2,Poor construction,"I... expected perfection from panasonic. I have 2 big complaints: 1)Its unbelievable how poorly constructed this phone is! It sounds ok, but the handset creaks whenever you just squeeze it a little while talking. Its VERY annoying because the noises are amplified thru the earpiece and actually hurts my ear. Its like the parts don't fit well together or something. While talking on the phone its impossible to hold your hand perfectly still, so every time you move it makes creaking sounds (sorry but thats the best i can describe it). 2)The base unit will frequently malfunction and won't even pickup incoming calls, so the phone doesn't ring. Nothing on the base will work when this happens so I have to unplug it, then plug it back in and it usually works after that but is a major pain in the neck. Customer service didn't help. I would stay away from this phone for sure!!"
1,Don't buy Panasonic KXTG2570,"I was one of the first to breathlessly purchase this phone about a year ago. What a mistake! So many features that made Panasonics early cordless phones the best are gone and instead are replaced with confusing, ridiculous new ones. You can't do ANYTHING without the handset and good luck firguring out how to set the time. It is non-intuitive, you have to rinky-dink the phone in place so it can actually re-charge and it's range it questionable.With so many 2.4Ghz on the market now, there is no reason to buy this inferior product. My home just experienced an major power surge (blow-up the transformer). The Panasonic KXTG2570 was on the same surpe protector as my computer. The Mac is fine, the Panasonic KXTG2570 is FRIED and DEAD. I'm happy though -- now I have the opportunity to buy a decent 2.4Ghz phone.I love Panasonic; I own their VCR and DVD players and they are excellent. Their early cordless phones were excllent -- they sadly dropped the ball in this one."
1,Very poorly designed phone,"I have had many cordless phones (including Panasonic - my last one did well), and this one is by far the worst. I was looking forward to long range and clear reception, but it falls far short of any expectations the cost should imply, and all the other problems render the phone almost useless. We had a lot of difficulty hearing anyone because the mic picked up every noise in the house while talking and fed it back in your ear. We had a problem with out-of range cut-outs when standing right next to the base unit. You can not program any function without the manual right there to read the codes. Even the layout of the buttons was poorly thought out. I think Panasonic came up with a big loser on this one. I wish I would have returned it shortly after I got it. It has since completely died - just quit working, a very expensive addition to the trash heap."
1,If I could give it less than 1 star....,"This is a joke. I have had this phone since 12/01 and it just completely died. I am standing on top of the base and it says out of range. The caller id never picks up, for that matter, by the time the phone decides to ring, the caller has gone to the answering machine. The static is awful-and it just happened overnight. I DO not recommend this..."
1,Buzzing,"I bought this phone a year ago and have recently started having exactly the same problem with this phone as other customers - buzzing. It starts after ~20 minutes into conversation and makes it impossible to use the phone. I called Panasonic customer service and they suggested replacing handset battery which I was not able to find so far. After reading other reviews, I am hesitant to waste more money on this."
3,Pros and Cons,"Great Range, Good Sound, Lotsa Features.Not intuitive, Very short battery life (2 - 3 hrs talk time) 3-4 days stand by, Large footprint."
1,Useless contraption,"I would have been better off with a string tied toa paper cup. In the entire history of electronics,this is the worst product ever made."
3,First release of this model not too bad...but...,"Bought this phone about 18 months ago. The battery has lasted a long time between recharges, and never had static issues like other people have. But I must of been one of the lucky ones because everyone seems to have the same issues.My issue, lost manual, can't figure out how to set the time again...the menu/programming for most functions are some special key combos that you would never remember...that has been the bad part for me...also changing channel doesn't seem to work like others have reported...One other thing...caller ID stopped working when you are already on the phone talking on the other line, it used to show the caller's info, but this mysteriously stopped working after 8 months...caller ID still works if it is the first call though.If anyone has the manual codes for setting time..please email me or post them here along with other info...I can't get this thing to set the time/date....Good luck..."
1,bad phone,I came online to amazon.com to search for a new better phone and came accross this one. I already have it and it is the worst phone i have ever had. i've had it for about almost three years and i shouldn't have even kept it that long. The battery life is EXTREMELY short. i talk on the phone a lot and i cut almost all of my conversations short beacause the phone needs to be charged. BUYERS BEWARE!!!
1,Terrible,"I had this phone for about 6 months when all went downhill. Similiar to other reviews I had the same problems. Ultimately the out of range will not turn off and the phone is now in the garbage. It completely stopped working one day and I could only get a dial tone from the speaker button, however, you cannot dial with this so I was out of luck and out of a phone. Because i procrastinated I did not send it back to the warehouse as you have to do upon calling customer service.The phone is certainly not user friendly, who wants to press 3 buttons to redial a call and it only stores 30 numbers. I also own the SONY Spread spectrum 900 mhz and prefer it. However, this phone too, has failed on many occasions.The Panasonic ultimately was a big waste of money. With most of these phones, the more technology, the worse they are after a few months of use. I would not recommend this to anyone who wants a phone to last longer than a few months."
1,It just plain doesn't work!,"I really wish I had read all these reviews before wasting my money on this phone. I have had the exact same problems as most users here--namely, that buzzing/binging noise that obliterates all other sound and that ""Out of range"" message displayed when I'm standing right next to the base unit.I've tried to remedy these problems, to no avail. I let the battery drain completely and then recharged the handset--the buzzing/binging actually got worse! After reading here about Panasonic's customer service (or lack thereof), I'm not inclined to waste any more of my time and money repeatedly mailing the phone back for repairs, so I'll probably end up trashing it. I've already gone back to my old analog Panasonic cordless KX-T3965, which has none of the flashy features of this one but is built like a tank and has functioned solidly for six years. Since day one, my 2570 has not been usable as anything but a very expensive answering machine and caller ID device!"
2,"This Price, this new and NO MUTE BUTTON!!!!","I don't know about you, but when I shell out cash for the latest tech gadget, I expect all the features of yesteryear and better. So how come there's no MUTE button?? And what's with the annoying menu navigation button that's no user friendly?? Panasonic is not the only culprit though because I have tried every 2.4 ghz on the market and 70% do not have MUTE. What's going on here, do people not feel the need for privacy anymore? I spend a lot of time on conf calls from home and I need a MUTE.The phone did have really excellent range though, looks cool and durable, great clarity and no interference. I just need a MUTE. So, it went back to the store along with the others."
1,Panasonic nice look-lowquality,"This phone lasted < one month. Pathetic. I threw itout.. By the time you pay for sending it back to a fixit center, packand drive to the mailing point, go without a phone for weeks, it is ahuge inconvenience. Manufactures with lousy product qc, likePanasonic should pay. Panasonic will because I have had it withthem. I bought 6 phones from them recently, ( all $ 200+) and I ambatting 4 out of 6 and have had it. Plus, my last models before theseones were relatively short lived,( two + years) so I gave these guysplenty of chances They sell high priced phones .. in poor quality andI can only assume it is because of lousy management in qc. Panasonichas no problem charging premium prices, but their equipmentperformance follow thorugh is awful. I got suckered by theattractivenss of their products....again THumbs down"
1,This phone made me hate ALL Panasonic phones.,"This is the worst phone I've even owned. After a few months of use, it's impossible to use ever again. Can't erase old numbers from the handset. Constantly beeps OUT OF RANGE message when trying to erase. Can't hear the person on the other end. Because of this bad purchase, I bacame weary of other Panasonic phones."
1,Unusable after the warranty expires.,"I was happy at first with this Panasonic product because of its great clarity...it was indistinguishable from a corded phone. However certain problems arose such as the counter intuitive control buttons requiring two steps to redial, the silver paint peeling off, and the large heavy handset becoming quite warm after a few minutes. I got adjusted to these idiosyncrasies, but in about a year and a half after the warranty had expired, my Panasonic phone began developing a strong, pulsing static noise after ten minutes which would completely obliterate the reception forcing me to use my old 900mhz phone. After reading all the other reviews of this product I decided not to repair it because of the numerous horror stories of Panasonic customer service with this model phone. I bought a Uniden with the same features instead; it was smaller, lighter, functionally easier to use, and doesn't roast my right ear."
1,SEARCHING....OUT OF RANGE,"The other reviews are right! Phone worked great for a few years, now displays ""Searching"" ""Out of range"" even when I'm right next to the handset. Tried calling the cust. service number, but the wait is usually around 16 minutes. Tried a new battery, to no avail. Personally, I didn't think it was too hard to use. I don't consult the manual at all, and can use all the features. But, don't buy this phone. You'll be disappointed."
1,There's no 0 Level ! -- Buzzing,"Like most other reviewers, it was incredulous to me that Panasonic would do such a poor job with one of their top of the line products. If I had paid $40 for a cordless phone, I could understand the problems I've had. But when I pay [this amount of money] for a phone, I expect a certain level of quality and service.I would rate this phone at a 0 because if its constant buzzing after a few minutes. I paid $25 to buy a replacement battery thinking that the battery was the source of my problems. The buzzing is actaully worse, and now I get ""out of range"" errors that prohibit the use of the phone. Also, it's hidden redial feature amazes me. I searched and searched for the quick redial feature and the one touch dialing which I just knew would be there. I wish I had the time to pursue this with the BBB."
4,Great voice reception,"I recently purchased this phone and after reading these reviews I thought I should take it back. Then I thought about my experiences with it. It's got great reception, easy to use, looks nice and has other miscellaneous functions I like. I don't see where the bad reviews can come from. I live in a two-story house and I use the phone mainly in my computer room. I thought all the electronic equipment (2 computers, hub, RCA Home Theater receiver, 2 Cerwin Vega AT-15s and 3 other speakers plus tv) would at least cause some interference but so far there's been absolutely none. It's worked great inside the house, my room, basement, etc with no loss in range nor quality. My only caveat is that the base rings, other than that, it's an awesome phone."
4,As a non-Catholic,"Being a non-Catholic I still found this book very useful for studying and getting a better idea of the Catholic fatih. I didn't agree with the author in many aspects, but I still found his writing well laid out and easy to read. It helps to clear up any misinformation that non-Catholics might receive about the Catholic faith."
3,Bargain,This was a great price and was worth the money. It stays in my teaching supplies for those extra free minutes in class.
2,Did we read the same book??,"I thought this book had a lot of promise, and felt good about my decision as I began to read it. However, it wasn't long before I tired of all the temper tantrums and yelling that went on. Character development....wasn't much beyond tempermental women who had two volumes, contrite and angry. I was disappointed, but still see a lot of promise in Ms. Alexander and look forward to a second chance."
5,bro loved it!!,my bro loved it! it can be built into a boat or a snow mobile! the moray figure is cool!the corba moccasin guns can attach to the figure! we have 6 sets we love them!!!!!
3,Decent music but no masterpieces here,"David Hurwitz of Classics Today raved about this music but I find it a bit over rated. There are some decent tunes here and some interesting coloration, but also a few duds as well. It's mostly fun music but not much that I would condsider memorable. Just don't expect a lot of depth. Get the 36 Greek Dances from this composer for some great music, much better than this CD. Very good playing and sound."
5,Great Product!,We purchased this dream machine for our master bedroom and it has worked great. We are really happy with the noise level and are actually thinking of giving this to our son and getting another one for our room. Definitely better then having a fan blowing on you in the winter.Would definitely recommend this to anyone.
1,"Irritating, not soothing","After reading the other rave reviews and purchasing this product, I was disappointed to find the noise the machine makes to be quite grating on the ears. I had a headache within minutes of turning it on. The product is essentially a small fan in a small plastic case; I found I slept much better when I turned on a full-sized fan, which doesn't make as irritating a sound, and which was a lot cheaper, too. I had hoped that using this product would save electricity (and alleviate my guilt about using fossil fuel to power a full-sized fan while I sleep) but the noise was just so irritating I couldn't use it at all."
2,just more noise,"I thought this would help in an office to reduce voice traveling however, what it really did was annoy me! People where always asking ""do you hear that noise"" just didn't work for me."
1,Irritating NOISE!,"Based on the positive reviews on Marpac Sleep Mate 980, I purchased this machine for my boyfriend as a Christmas present. I am so thankful that I tried the machine beforehand for one night before giving it to him because the noise that came out of it is so loud and irritating, that the outside and upstairs neighbor's noise I was trying to mask seemed more bearable! This machine really grated on my nerves. I had to return it! I think this machine is fine if you are used to loud noises and like really loud noises."
4,Does it help sleep?,"The Marpac works fine and arrived promptly and as advertised. I like the white noise, but my husband hears things in it that I don't, so I can't use it all the time. I think it is an effective product for those who can use it consistently."
5,Where has this been my whole life?,"The apartment building I live in is very poorly insulated for sound. Desperate, I ordered this to try to drown out a thoughtless, loud upstairs neighbor. I was so surprised that I received the machine within two days of placing my order. It is very compact. It isn't enough to drown out noise completely, but it works deceptively well in blending and muffling any noises to a point where your sleep is not disturbed. I have been sleeping so deeply since I got this machine! I hadn't realized how poorly I had been sleeping before. It's like having the comforting sound of a loud fan on all night without waking up freezing or having higher heating bills in the winter. I am beyond thrilled!"
3,works,"It works well and keeps from having to have hands on but if pooh is soft or running it just leaves mess still in the grass or where ever. I actually find it easier to use my hand through a bag, or shovel and rake, so I figured this would be good to pack up to take on long walks to keep from having to have hands on when out for a walk."
4,LOVE IT!,"I have a 50 lbs. boxer and this works great for us! The only reason I gave it 4 stars is I often watch a friend's great dane and, well, this does not work for her at all. I wish the teeth opened slightly wider. I had a box of the 'bags on board' already (the ones that are advertised with this) and I think they work just fine. Some of the other reviews say they are not big enough, but I have not had any problems..."
4,Don't buy the Bags on Board Biodegradable Bags to go with this product,"This product works great! However, do NOT buy the ""Bags On Board"" bags to go with it as they are too small and will not allow the ""Skoop-N_Pak"" to open wide enough to be used...These bags should not be featured with this product!!!!Bags on Board Biodegradable Bag Refill for Dispensers, 120 Bags"
4,"lasted for almost 2 years, hard to find bags big enough","We bought this almost 2 years ago to use daily with 2 dogs. About a month or so ago, one of the handles broke. We put some electrical tape on it and that lasted until the other day. Now, it's officially broken. the plastic degrades and this happens. For the cost, I think it performed well and lasted long enough. It works well. the only real issue I have is that you need large bags to fit. they've become hard to find and the prices has certainly gone up since we first bought this. Regular poopie bags do not fit well. Lately, we've started just keeping a stock of grocery bags near the hook where we hang the skooper and just using those in it. works fine as long as you make sure there are no holes in the bag"
1,i feel dissapointment,"i buy this cd only for a Pepper mashay Song , Not much Heaven but the version incluid on this cd is a bad version , she just dont sing , on the pepper web site the version Uptown expressis a good vocalcolvico"
1,Tiresome fantasy scifi,"I like good techno-real science fiction or at least a good space opera, fantasy scifi is not what I like to read. Unfortunately this novel goes off into drivel about princes and princlings wearing red and gold outfits and even has people riding horses and harvesting crops.This latest in the Andrej Koscuisko series from Ms. Matthews is the weakest of the series. Previous novels in the series were at times gruesome but also exciting and well written. The writing in this one is difficult to read requiring that I read a paragraph over a time or two to get it. The sentence structure is awkward and not always just to try to convey the strange world and language of the planet where the story is set.This novel does not stand alone. One must have read the previous novels in the series to enjoy this one and one must have read them recently enough to remember all about Dormitt Prison, and why what's-her-name hates Andrej so much or much of the story in this novel makes little sense."
5,"ENTRE MI COLECCI""N DE","LIBROS DE CHISTES, A ESTE LO LLAMO ""MI PROZAC "", porque me quita la tristeza como de magia y me hace reír como loquito !Muy latinos, muy buenos !"
2,"Al son que me toquen,¡bailo y canto!","Quality: between mediocre and bad. I am proud of speaking Spanish and the glorious cultural baggage that we inherited. However, a book like this makes me think twice about some of my fellow Spanish-speaking people.Muy pocos chistes originales, muy pocos chistes que se puedan llamar tal. Lástima que haya gente que se atreva a publicar libros de calidad tan pobre."
3,Apocalyptic Stuff,"D20 modern takes on the post apocalyptic thing, again. The cool side of this is that, like all official d20 products I have seen so far, you are given options... Choose the nature of the apocalypse and have fun. Three possible apocalypses are detailed - judgement day/left behind stuff, ""rise of the machines"", and the typical post atomic holocaust stuff. On the down side, the actual rules are a bit skimpy, though it is refreshing to see someone try to approach the genre from a wide open perspective."
3,"Good start, poor support","As stated before, this book is a bit skimpy on the details. What has disappointed me was the fact that many of the rules and tables needed to use the book are NOT included. Example: radiation rules...""please see D20 Future"". Some new mutation examples were given but 75% of the rest are not included. Only buy this book if you already have or are planning on purchasing d20 Future."
4,What a find!,"Not being familiar with Elkin or his work, it was a pleasant surprise to read 'Dick Gibson.' Elkin has an amazing imagination, and a wonderful ear for wordplay. The 'guests' on Gibson's radio shows just can't help but reveal their deepest, darkest (usually sexual) secrets. And Gibson is too smart to step in their way. This book is amazingly prescient about the advent of 'entertainment' like Jerry Springer, ""reality"" programs, and all those radio shows people call just hear themselves think. It's a shame this programming has none of Elkin's sardonic wit - or his intelligence. I'm looking forward to reading more Elkin."
4,Outstanding story from a great neglected writer,"The Dick Gibson Show has been long out of print. It is typical Stanley Elkin, wild streams of consciousness spew from an itenerant radio announcer that live and breathe and make you take notice. This one is up there with The Franchiser and The MacGuffin."
2,"Sorry, couldn't finish it","I read an interesting review of this book, and decided to buy it. The reviewer said that it was hard to follow, and that's the way that I see it. Couldn't finish it."
2,not what I expected....,"I'm an acupuncture student and was looking for a more in depth discussion of the mystical aspect of acupuncture...The title is beautiful and implies insight into the spiritual and alchemical aspects of acupuncture, yet it does not do that. Instead we are given case histories and few acupuncture points used, but no background info as to why those points were chosen. There was nothing alchemical or spiritual about the book. Although it does give a good example of the interview process of the patient."
1,Five Spirits: Alchemical Acupuncture for Psychological and Spiritual Healing,"It is the same exact information out there in many other books, but at an expensive price. If you never knew anything about alchemical acupuncture it would be a good book for you, but if you do, this book teaches you nothing new. It does have a beautiful cover."
5,Wise and thought provoking,"This book profoundly affected my practice as an acupuncturist and as a person. Ms. Dechar is a humble, wise and learned scholar who has seriously researched the five spirits and the process of alchemical acupuncture for decades. I studied with her in NYC over 10 years ago and can say she is truly a gifted practitioner and this book encapsulates her wisdom."
3,Cheap...but cheap?,"This sounds great but when I got it, I stuck the mags on and it doesn't seem to hold them tightly. It does hold them but they flop around a little. Not sure how it will work under live fire so time will tell if it holds or vibrates the lower mag loose. No instructions either so how would I know if this is the way they are or not. I would have paid a bit more for a more quality product that isn't so loose."
2,Just OK,It doesn't fit all my mags and doesn't always fit securely. I don't feel that it gives me an advantage over single magazine.YMMV
3,Not what I thought it would be.,"The item description was correct.The price is average.I would not buy another item like this one, I think it is a waste.Did not realise I had to super glue this item to my little ammo clips.thank you for the quick service.my mistake"
1,you get what you pay for,"I put my ruger mags together, and found a poor fit, one mag is always falling off, it didn't cost much, and it's cheap."
5,Like a Swiss watch,"Little swiss made driver really cranks. Bought 10.8v recon, and they sent me two 12v batts to go with it. Obviously they consider them virtually interchangeable, and I'll take their word on it. I've used a bunch of Bosch cordless and corded stuff, and remain a big fan."
3,OK product,"The unbreakable autolock does secure your car from being stolen since it is locked onto your break pedal. However after a few months of it working fine, the autolock locked on my breaks and I had a difficult time getting it off. This is very frustrating especially if you're in a hurry or in an unsafe neighborhood and want to get away quickly. It took me close to a half hour to unlock it. After that I threw it out because I didn't want that to happen to me at an unfortunate time."
4,Better than the rest,"The reg club can be easily removed by cutting the steering wheel, I feel more comfortable with this product locked on to my bakes. I do know if a car thief is determined, he might figure it out(if there is a will there is a way). Definitely worth it."
3,Don't rely on it,"My car was stolen with this device properly attached. When I retrieved the car, the busted AutoLock was waiting for me on my front seat. The AutoLock's shorter metal ""arm"" was bent out of the way (separated from the rest of the Autolock by about an inch), and the brake pedal face bent slightly, enabling the AutoLock to slip off the brake. From articles I've read about the AutoLock on the Internet, it's length is a major weakness: it can be used as leverage to bend the (relatively) weak metal arm and disable it. Either that happened, or a crowbar was used to bend it.Bottom line: don't rely 100% on this device to protect your car. Nothing can do that. It is only a deterrent, just like the Club, and will not prevent a determined thief from taking your car. However, realizing the flaws of the AutoLock, I can say that now I own and use BOTH the Club and Autolock, and just hope that the work to disable this tandem is enough to discourage the next would-be thief."
2,A professional can unlock it in 5 seconds,"A chain is only as strong as its weakest link, and the weakest link on this thing is the lock. A professional thief doesn't even have to bend anything. A pro with an easily obtainable locksmith's tool will take 5 seconds to open the device's ""tubular lock"" (aka ""barrel lock""). (You've probably seen barrel locks on those rigid u-shaped bicycle locks and on vending machines.)Hey, at least the concept is not stupid like The Club, and keeping amateurs at bay is a great thing.But I think that this device can give a false sense of security. if you really care about preventing theft you'll also want something like an alarm with a kill switch."
2,cylinder lock malfunctions,"I own both the original unbreakable autolock (with the flat key) and the autolock pro (with the round key). The original autolock never failed to open after 10+ years of use on two cars. The autolock pro failed to open after about two years of light use. This is not a key problem, because I could not open it with two original keys. I eventually wiggled the lock a lot to open it. I recommend that you stick with the original autolock if you wish to use this kind of security device."
4,AutoLock,"I give this product four stars. It's easy to use, and even better-- my car hasn't been stolen."
2,Not what I was expecting,This book was more of a self-help book to find your 'inner goddess'. I was looking for something a bit different than this. Read the book either way and it wasn't bad/wasn't good either. Not what I was looking for.... :(
1,Ughhh,"If I could have rated this lower than one star, I would have. Ick. I was expecting something more along the line of Mama Gena's books. Nope. Mama Gena can write for one thing. Most of this book is quizes, definitions and party games. I'm thinking I'm mailing this one back. Buy anything from Mama Gena. Avoid this one."
1,PaLease....,"No, no, no...this book is all wrong. The ""Goddess"" catagories are trite and inefectual...the banter is boring and plain silly. It's not smart enough to be entertaining, and not intellectual enough to be enlightening. And now Francesca is a ""Spiritual Healer""? Take yourself over to ""Kiss My Tiara : How to Rule the World as a SmartMouth Goddess"" and dust off your Tiara."
1,"Great toy idea, poor execution","This was a great idea for a toy, but was poorly executed. We love Tonka toys in general, but this was a big disappointment. Building blocks will Not stay together, but pop off/apart when you try to build it. For example, wheels will not stay attached to bottom of vehicle constantly falling off. Another example, the machine that holds the saw will not stay attached to top of vehicle. Thus, it is a source of frustration for my imaginative 4 year old son rather than a source of fun/entertainment. It is a cheap, poor quality knockoff of the Lego name brand toys."
2,Accuracy does not equal greatness.,"Sure, the chorus on this recording is without flaw, but that is hardly what makes a recording worth your while. Robert Shaw has no idea how to get the most out of an orchestra (though part of that is that the ASO is not exactly the world's finest). It bothers me that this amazing work of art can be performed with so little life. Mr. Shaw just seems to miss so much of what this score has to offer.This recording was the first I ever heard of Beethoven's Solemn Mass, and it is through this recording I learned to love this magnificent piece of art, but believe me when I say that while Beethoven still shines through this recording, he is brought to life much more profoundly in other recordings. I highly recommend the Bernstein / Moser / Schwarz / Kollo / Moll recording with the Concertgebouworkest. It is through that recording that I understood the difference between a perfectionist (Shaw) and an artist (Berstein)."
5,ILSE'S BIG SOLO DEBUT!,"When this album burst into the spanish media was one of the best solo debut of any artist from pop groups of Mexico. Ilse came from Flans the mexican version of Bananarama, but more fun and real. When Ilse took some years to shake off the teeny booper persona, she returned with this album that IMO is one of the best conceptual records in spanish. AFRICA was that, an african-pop-oriented album with superb beats and clever lyrics, this is underrated in this years, but by the early 90's Ilse was just in the right track for stardom, WE WE is funky, BATONGA is mystic, HABLAME is mellow, AFRICA is inspirational, SERPIENTE is for dancing, an amazing album a must have to any POP lover. Ilse took a couple of years before returning to the scene with SUAVECITO, that album didn't match the boldness of AFRICA, but still makes ILSE a mysterious artist that should have been bigger."
1,m3p musicor years,"I want to give this alblum a 5 star rating ; because it's the Musicor years (which i listend to and still own the original 45's I love you 1000 times, With this ring , Washed Ahored). Why aren't the Platters Musicor years avalible on m3p? I love you 1000 times had a more dramatic ending on the Musicor lable which is cut off on the rearranged version."
5,"Outstanding book, paperback is even better","The paperback version of this book contains the Ghazals in English, Devnagari, and Urdu script. Go for the paperback and see how the original poems look in Urdu. For those of us who can read Urdu, it is a delight to read the original verses and match them with the English translation."
5,5 stars isn't enough. I give these speakers 10!!!!,"These speakers are awesome looking, and awesome sounding. I own 4 different pair of polk audio speakers. One set being a satellite system which are ok, one set of older floor models which sound good, one pair of large bookshelf speakers which also sound ok, but these suckers sound down right incredible. I have to say they are the best sounding speakers I have ever owned. These speakers give crisp clear highs, solid and full midrange, and deep bass, everything you want out of a floor model speaker. I hear things in songs I never knew were there before. Before you buy any other speaker do yourself a favor and give the RTi10 a listen, you will surely be blown away. Two thumbs up to Polk for building such an awesome sounding and awesome looking speaker..."
5,Enduring Comfort and Style,"While browsing other AE styles, I noticed the Shelton here. I realized they are the successor to the AE ""Polo"" pair that I own. I purchased my pair of AE Saddle Oxfords in Black/Burgandy in 1981 (no typo - 30 years ago.) I had them re-soled by a quality cobbler...maybe 1999-2000. They have the creases of use and wear, but still shine beautifully and feel like only an AE shoe can. I have owned many pairs of AE shoes (& a couple of pairs of boots.) over the years. No trendy styling, but solid quality, durability, and class. BTW...I have owned a few pairs of Johnson Murphy's - good shoes, but still not close to the superior AE's!!"
4,Could be better,"The game is fun but I only rated fun 4 stars because you need more people in the begining of the game for it to be fun and it is a really long game. My game was missing pieces, but i might have just got a defective one. This game is really fun and i reccomend it for the younger kids with superstar dreams."
1,Latin Moods Review,I had to return this CD because it was the wrong CD. I guess I must have selected the wrong Latin Mood CD.
3,Good but too dark.,Screen works well.Good resolution.However - it was too dark for me to use as a rear view mirror.Had to modify it to fit on my sun visor.Should be a more reflective surface.
1,I have not recieved it yet. They shipped the wrong mirror and it was defective. One month later still waiting for the correct mi,"I still have not received this mirror after waiting a month. The first mirror was the wrong model and did not even work. I shipped it back and I am still waiting for the right mirror to be shipped. waiting and waiting! By the way, the first mirror I had was very dark, and when installed in my truck it was hard to see out of. During the day it was almost like driving while dark. You could not see the images good. But I guess that is quite common with all these type of mirrors. I could not tell you if the camera was good because it did not work."
1,Missing the Point,"Having laid out the price (plus sales tax)for Garry Wills' ""Witches and Jesuits"", it becomes neccessary to state that I had no trouble in putting it down. First, the author expends a great deal of energy demonstrating that there was a plethora of mindless plays and books about witches, etc. after the (unfortunately unsuccessful) attempt to blow up James and the Parliament. The author never seems to realize that what makes Shakespeare great is how he is DIFFERENT from his contemporaries.Secondly, the author appears to have an inside track on the mind of God. He states baldly that God was on Malcolm's side, and Malcolm is the most depraved brat in the Canon. Mr. Wills doesn't have a clue as to ""What Happens in Macbeth"". The book is an excellent exercise in the politics of the Jamesian age,but who cares? James was referred to as the 'biggest fool in Christendom"". However if one is searching for Shakespere, look elsewhere."
1,Rehash of Known Facts,"The connection between the Gundpowder Plot and Macbeth is well known. There is little, if any, new scholarship in this book."
5,"My kids loved it, and so did I","This is a great book! Both my children loved it. They are 8 and 12 years old. They would not put it down, and talked about Hagen all the time. It is easy to read and understand. I read it also.My 12 year old relates some of his own adventures to Hagen's.Move over Harry Potter... I can't wait for the squel and neither can my children."
4,Nice Nu-Jazz CD,"Simply awesome band. This album combines their superb sound of soul and jazz. If you like downtempo, mellow, nu-jazz, this is your CD."

4,"Ah! the Germans have soul, baby!",Ah sooky sooky now! This band of German musicians are simply awesome. This album combines their superb sound of soul and jazz. There are only a few songs that did not have me bouncing my head as much but overall a worthy buy! Check them out.
5,This cd is epic.,I was reluctant to pick up this cd. I listened to it a couple times at a listening station when it was first released but I was weary at that point of all the Jazzanova imitations popping up. Well I saw DJ Ender spin one night in Tokyo. Quite an impressive set. I saw this cd in a discount section of a cd shop and picked it up. Boy were my suspicions wrong. This cd is a masterpiece. Utter perfection. A definite keeper. Definitely in my personal top cds.get it. you wont regret.
5,Possibly the Best Album of All Time,"I'm sure if you are reading this I don't need to explain this album. It is possibly the best album of all time. This is what good music is supposed to be about. Virtuosity, originality, and flawless harmony. I'm so glad that I discovered this music when I was young. It has truly changed my life.Thanks Tony, etc."
5,R&B WITH A SENSE OF HUMOR!,"This is a great find for anyone who loves a hard swinging shuffle with great solos and a cute story sung in a telling way by a cool hipster. Gene's penchant for songs about full size women is a riot. With titles like BIG LEGS, BIG FAT MAMMA, SNUFF DRIPPING MAMMA, PUNKIN HEAD AND FATSO you know this is going to be a good time. The band swings like Lionel Hampton while Gene rocks along in a Louis Jordan groove. Sound quality is superb and with a total of 25 cuts this is a great lesson of what Jump Blues is all about."
5,Vikings video by NOVA,"Boy do I love reading books and watching videos about these guys! Two ships with only 120 men could storm a town of thousands, pillage it senseless, and get away clean to do it again 20 miles down coast. Once their ships were so full of booty they couldn't plunder another town, they headed home, only to have to worry about later-launching Vikings who might decide to plunder them! How such barbarism could be so effective for centuries without anyone finding a way to thwart them is a mystery to me, but there it is.Another mystery is why all of ""civilized"" Europe stayed within comfortable sight of land, while only the Vikings had the courage to sail beyond the horizon, braving the monsters and the end of the earth. Some say it was just greed, but that greed had to be backed up with a lot of courage and skill. It took another 500 years before Columbus risked a western voyage."
5,Sooooo.. Pleased!,"Absolutely love all Charles Kuralt's tapes. His voice is so soothing and his choice of words make it so easy to imagine being there with him. Each time I go on a trip, whether for a week or a day, I leave early in the morning and pop one of his tapes in to play. I own all of them and only wish they would all come in CD form, almost all only come in cassette form."
3,"Not their best, but still good","Casting the Stones is a bit of a throwback album for Jag Panzer. They're going back to their old roots a bit on this one. The good thing is that they never let up. Track after track is brutal and with Harry just tearing his vocal chords apart. I like to think this album is a mix between Ample and Age of Mastery without all the themes and whatnot. Certainly a good album if you love the mixture of Briody and Broderick on guitar. They always manage to rip it up on each track.My fav track would have to be ""Achilles"". I've always been fascinated when you can incorporate a story into your song and make it sound great. My only gripe is that it's too short, but that's quite alright as you can always hit the repeat button and play it over and over as do I."
5,One of the BEST American Metal Now a Days!!!!!!,"I got to be honest I usually don't lke American metal, and this is because of so much of the nu-metal crap that is of there, most of it coming from the States. But somehow I knew about this band for sometime all ready. They are one of the few American Bands that play good Metal. Jag panzer can do no wrong, since their album The Age Of Mastery every album after has been glorious.The band just plays Power Metal, with no happy melodies, they just play hard and fast. I am supprised that not that many people know about them, even though they have been playing for about 20 years. It takes a few listens to actually appreciate the content of this album. Make sure you check out the singer, people call him ""The Tyrant"" for some reason. So give Jag Panzer a try.Fav Songs: The Mission (1943), Vigilant, Legion Immortal Listen"
1,Disappointed!,"I was so excited to see Tazza D'Oro Caffe' offered on Amazon for such an amazing price, I ordered it on the spot! After one brew, I realized immediately that it was NOT the original blend I enjoyed for years at Rome's Tazza D'Oro bar near the Pantheon, but a much lighter, watered down blend. I will never understand why companies market these items for export, as original. Simply compare Amazon's prices vs. the actual prices from Tazza D'Oro's site plus their ridiculous shipping costs, and one can see why the products are so far apart in quality. I will not be ordering this product again from any other site than the official TD site."
3,A bit dated; but good nonetheless,"I've been trying to get more indepth involvement in the topic of risk and risk management at work. I found this from an Amazon partner at a really great price and decided to give it a whirl. It is a bit outdated but has a really good bunch of material that is surprisingly tractable given that in my experience books written in this timeframe tended to be pretty hard to use without a professor holding your hand. This one, in that regard, is somewhat typical but was surprisingly better than I would have expected. This is a definite keeper."
5,Great holster - great price.,"This was was purchased for my Glock 30SF. The fit is perfect and the holster stays where it's supposed to be upon drawing the weapon from either strong or weak side.I have Galco inside waistband holsters like this one for several different handguns and I've been happy with all of them.This item was sold as used. I don't know what the seller's criteria for used is, but it arrived in perfect/new condition and in Galco's original sealed packaging, with tags."
5,Holster for the G30,I highly recommend this holster for anyone who owns a glock 30 looking for concealment. I did not expect this holster to be fantastic but I was pleasantly surprised. For the money you're getting a very comfortable high quality holster. Easy to holster and the draw of you're g30 will be very quick. Was not expecting this at all I'm very happy with this purchase.
5,Great product and price,"Recieved the item quickly, it was exactly as I expected with a price of a much lesser quality item. Why get in your car to shop?"
3,Not what I expected...,"This book has a lot of good information and nice pictures. I was however expecting more actual plans and more of a variety. Most of the locations are in Canada or cold parts of the U.S. (with some exceptions in Texas) and the theme of the front yards were mostly a cottage garden look or something similar (again, with the Texas houses as the exception). I'll keep looking for another book that has more styles to pick from."
5,This book inspired me to expand my front yard garden!,"If you want more than a plain grass lawn, but need ideas for what to do, this book is for you. Full of beautiful photography, this book will give you plenty of inspiration. Primeau discusses the advantages to replacing your grass lawn with garden. Chapters are arranged according to different garden styles. Each chapter gives some plant suggestions as well."
5,Front Yard Gardens,This book is beautifully illustrated and very helpful. I have shared ideas from this with friends and family.
3,Too much repetition in the program sections,"This is a good book for learning to tweek NT, but not much help on the subject of application installations. Nothing on the shell link for installing Icons to the desk top or an explanation of the steps to correctly add the install/remove keys to the registry during application installations which I expected to be in the C++ programing section of the book."
2,Cradle does not charge PPC,"The cradle doesn't charge the PPC, there is a place to plug in an AC adapter on the cable itself but doesn't come with the adapter nor gives any info on power requirements. I still have to use the USB cable that came with the unit to charge it."
2,Smells Nasty,"I'm not sure why but these wipes smell like feces so they make everything you ""clean"" with them smell like feces.That seems kind of counter productive for a cleaning wipe."
1,Incredible waste of plastic in packaging!,"I originially priced this particular bundling of Cottonelles to be the cheapest price per wipe. I received my first shipment and was stunned to see how over-packaged and wasteful this bundle actually was. In addition to the tub and refill pack being individually packaged, they are then plastic wrapped together. Once you open the tub, each tub in the box has it's own plastic hanger, which is also wrapped in plastic. If you are looking to just refill and re-use tubs you already have, then steer clear of this bundle. It was far too wasteful to make you fill good about ordering refills."
5,Good product and good packaging!,The new dispenser is really good! It has a rubber gasket thingy that helps keep the product appropriately damp. Its hard to describe but it is different and it works. I like that a refill comes along with the FILLED dispenser box. Seems sensible.
3,"We won't buy these, no matter how cheap","Because they are just TOO moist. And without going into details, I will just say that the Charmin Freshmates leave us more ""fresh"" and ""clean"".I gave this three stars, because, well... They are better than TP alone, but... The Charmin Freshmates are the only ones we will buy anymore. I am disappointed not to see those offered by Amazon."
1,Not good if you have a reaction to them,"These things are pure evil. Used them for a couple yrs no problems. Then they went and changed the formula and told no one. Thought I had a severe case of jock itch for over 6 months. Kept using these thinking the ""leaner"" the better. In one of my many 100's of google searches found out they are now using a different preservative that supposedly only effect a few people out of a hundred. Well god be with you if you choose to use this garbage. It took 3 months of not sing these things to get my bum back to a semi normal state. Beware guys. I have even read new stories about some post man who was laid up for months his reaction was so bad."
3,"Not bad, some times too drawn out though","Hellraiser installements were pretty drawn out wiht no plot really, but did the best to keep watching them. The prophecy movies were kind of instresting and some were the basis for the start of some of today's well known actors and actresses."
5,Convenient!,"This device is great! Whether you have one, or a second one, it provides so much in the way of convenience. I purchased a second one for work and it lasted LONG after the terrible screen(s) used on the Viewsonic V35."
4,Just What ECE's Need,"I used this book in an ECE Curriculum Development and Techniques course while earning my MA. I found the information relevant, specific and easy to read. It was not overwhelming with un-heard-of concepts and it was very current in the theories and ideas presented. I would recommend this book to teachers, daycare providers and homeschoolers who are looking to improve their knowledge of integrated curriculum, and those who develop their own curriculum as a guideline book to being successful."
3,Very concentrated tartness,"I bought a can of the Honeyville Raspberries, Blueberries, and Strawberries based on reviews, and my total satisfaction with their Steel Cut Oats (which are excellent!). While my three year old loves all three of these freeze dried berries right out of the can, I have to say the raspberries are VERY tart. It seems like the process just concentrates their natural tartness, which was a surprise since fresh raspberries usually taste somewhere between tart and sweet. I can't say that I'd buy these again. I will buy the strawberries, which are tart, but nowhere near as sour as the raspberries. The blueberries are just the opposite. The freeze drying process seems to help blueberries taste much sweeter than fresh ones, and for the price of what's you pay for the equivalent quantity in fresh berries, I'll definitely buy the blueberries again because of the cost savings (we eat these every day)."
1,FRAUD,Borderline criminal. Purchased this program with a serial number that does not work. Customer service at Xelarate seems none exists. I believe its companies like Xelarate who caused the tech bubble to burst. The company is behaving like they are operating out of a garage in India or Pakistan. I WHAT MY MONEY BACK!!!
1,Cannot start a program,"I got an invalid serial number and cannot start a program. I'm trying to reach a customer service, but I'm not sure if I can get response because I read another's review that says he couldn't get any service from this company. It's totally nonsense that a software comes with an invalid serial."
1,Powerpdf came with invalid serial number!,"I bought my copy of PowerPdf (published by the company XELERATE) on Sunday, May 5 and tried to install it. The serial number I was provided with in the documentation is invalid. I went to the web site to contact the vendor about it. In order to send an e-mail to the tech support people, you are required to ""register"" at the site. Being obedient, I clicked on the ""registration"" link - and got a blank page.There is no way to contact the vendor at this point as no phone number is provided, nor an alternate e-mail address. I can't recommend a company or a software that is ripping me off at this point. I am out ...with no recourse, at this point. I only hope the managers at XELERATE see this review and contact me so I can rescind this review of their very poor ""quality control"". I'd like to try out the product."
2,"Works for all stations together, but not each one by itself","I bot two units. They work for ALL the stations on-off together, but cannot make it work for each individual lighting circuit."
3,Good Compendium,"This is a good book with lots of details. The edition I have is that pictured, the 1994 printing of the fourth ed. (1952) This volume contains almost as many knots as Ashley, but there is no correlation to the numbering systems. This book DOES have actual photos of the knots, rather than hand drawings, if you need them. Neither volume has explicit directions or diagrams for all knots; I guess that is what all the other books and websites are for...I would encourage anybody to buy either book, or better, both books, as they are great reference works, written from different perspectives, and one may provide clarification not found in the other."
3,"huge, beautiful, but not always completely useful","This, along with the Ashley Book of Knots, is one of the two ""landmark"" knot books. It belongs in the library of the serious knot researcher, but should not be the first or even second item in a new collection. That honor must go to Ashley.This is not a guide for beginners. Most knots are photographed complete and tight, with precious little material on tying steps. Even expert tyers will find some of the photos dificult to follow. Organization is often poor, with knots of completely different appearance and use sometimes on the same page.On the other hand, the sections on multi-strand knots, splicing, plaits, and decorative knotting are among the finest ever done, but again illlustrated directions are sparse.Definitely find a copy and take a good look at this book, but make sure it is what you want before purchasing."
5,A MUST for the Profesional,"This book is definitly NOT for the beginner! However it is also NOT the musty old tome that many feel that it is. Aboard any modern merchant ship, this is a MUST HAVE... I have used it in solving countless mooring ""splice and dice"" problems!At an intermediate or advanced level (or if you are a sailor by trade) ... Buy it!"
2,Not for newcomers,This a photocopy of a book from a jail in the US. It suffers from the plates being photocopies and rather dull and missing the contrast which were probably in the originals.The pictures show many variations on the same theme which is good but the descriptions of how to complete the knots is not for a newcomer to knotting.It has many variations on beltwork and macrame but very little on bell ropes and lanyards.Overall it is a good reference book for the more advanced knotter but its pictures and descriptions let it down.
3,Kind of fluffy,"I liked the historical information tht the book was based on, but thought some of the the characters were cartoonish"
2,Smells awful,"This product smells awful and it is so potent that it burned my skin the minute I put a drop of it on my neck. (I'm not an allergic type of person.) So I suggest, you mix this with some sort of jojoba or other oil at first to ensure that it doesn't do the same to you. Though I'm not sure if this would be bad for the product... You can always put it on mixed with some oil and wait a few minutes and then apply your perfume of choice.As for its effects on the opposite gender? I'm not sure. I've been wearing it for a about a week and so far it has made no difference. Virtually none at all. Though I'm not saying it's ineffective. If I notice any change at all, I'll re-edit my comments here.Good luck!"
1,no no and NO¡¡¡,"Ok this smells so horrible, lIt smells like feet, so awefull that my husband asked me to go take a shower. Nothing more to say about that, it was a waste of money, it burns n it stinks."
5,satisfied customer,I ordered this product and it smells aweful but it does attract the opposite sex. Once I figured out how to cover the smell it was fun watching the reaction of others when I walked by. So ladies if you desire to be desired get this and make sure you wear it with caution.
1,Awful,"Smelled like baby vomit and wasnt at all what was promised, it was just useless chemicals dumped in a bottle to trick people. DISGUSTING. Wish i could rate a zero. Waste of money"
3,Music for a Good Mood,"This album is hard to classify. To my mind, that is a good thing.A jazz lover can like this album if he or she can stretch his ears into New Age territory. A smooth jazz lover can like it if they can enjoy a Caribbean-Lite flavor. If you like to LISTEN to music, you will be rewarded with subtile complexity but if background music is your choice, this music will not intrude. All-in-all, this is a pleasant late 1980s release from from a popularly perennial sideman-percussionist who wanted face-time for his compositional talents.The positives; relatively restrained sonic settings for electronic instrumentation and a gentle abundance of rhythmic percussion. Negatives; solos from technically adept but weak saxophonists (I would have loved to have heard '80s vintage Gary Bartz on this session) and an attenuated emotional range.That said, this album will not knock your socks off but it will command repeated listening from those who enjoy unclassifiable, pleasant music."
5,A touch spendy but a solid product,I have been Vegan for approaching two years and recently joined my local gym and have become more active in general. Vega is not a cure-all but it is darn close. I feel much better all around when I have a glass of Vega that day.I have tried the chocolate flavor and vanilla chai flavor.I prefer the chocolate but tastes good as well. They also mix well together. I tend to make a smoothie out of it with some ice cubes and a handful or two of frozen fruit.If you don't need the nutrition to supplement an active lifestyle this is probably too much of a cost to be worth purchasing. For those who do have use for it I highly recommend it.
2,Wow,"Man, I can stomach just about anything, especially in the name of ""healthy."" I used to take straight wheatgrass shots with my mom when she was going through chemo and we thought THAT was bad. This product is flawless; wonderful nutrition, great customer support, and a strong mission to support those looking to support themselves- that's why I at least give it two stars. However, I have never tasted anything so awful in my life. Please, please, PLEASE purchase a sample from a Whole Foods store, or any retailer that supplies samples, before purchasing this product. I applauded those who can stomach the shakes, but there is no amount of organic cinnamon or fresh berries on earth that can help this product in my opinion. I'll stick to my green smoothies and protein supplements... PS- I tried both the ""chocolate"" and ""natural"" flavors."
3,It's green...,"I bought a sample packet of the Vega Complete Whole Food Optimizer Natural Flavor at my local health food store. I followed the package instruction to mix with 8 ounces cold water (the colder the water, the better). The liquid product is greenish and reminds me of what I imagine pond scum would taste like with a hint of vanilla flavor. The aftertaste is not horrible, but it was a struggle getting this down. I hope that the chocolate and vanilla chai flavors mask the essential greenness a little more. The natural flavor is not for me.Update - chocolate flavor is better and vanilla chai is quite palatable."
2,La Marseillaise,"This is a rather boring performance of the Berlioz version of La Marseillaise with poor recording quality. I ended up giving this CD to GoodWill. For the Hector Berlioz version of La Marseillaise, I would recommend the performance by the Chicago Symphony under the direction of Daniel Barenboim. If you are looking for a rousing performance of La Marseillaise (not the Berlioz version), look for the performance by Mireille Mathieu, which you can find on the web."
3,"A middle of the pack offering--nothing magic, nothing tragic","If you've heard Toscanini's snappy Rakozcy March, then the lumbering version on this disc will just leave you frustrated. The Marseillaise here is pretty turgid, too. Not much else leaves even that much of a lasting impression. Okay if you can get it budget-priced."
4,Good old fashion Satan movie!,Robert Forester known for Banyon tv series and Jackie Brown starsin this Satan thriller! it's more like a tv movie with decent storyand good acting. not great but better than most crap made today!
5,Maving Waves or Ocean City it's a wonderful place to be,"I read this whole series in high school, there's eleven books i think. I'm now 24. And I still think about these books and check to see if there will be sequels. For the next generation, read them! They will make you laugh and make you mad. I threw one against the wall in an angry fit but of course I picked it back up again, and again, and again."
1,Great book!,This is quite possibly the best book I've ever read! Its got great charachters (my faves are Connor and Chelsea--i hope they get together!) and it was really easy to relate to them. This is a great book and I'm looking forward to reading all the others.
1,One of most boring science fiction/fantasy books ever written,I have been reading science fiction and fantasy for over forty years and have never read (well almost never)anything so boring and utterly unimaginative as this book. Why on earth some readers have given this absolute drivel a high rating is beyond me.
1,Greatest Fantasy Book of All Time -- NOT!!!,"Voted the 'greatest fantasy book of all time' by a bunch of people...gosh, what were you taking at the time? This book is virtually unreadable. I know that fantasy writers love to create their own very different universe, but does it need to be so far removed from comprehension that it makes no sense at all? (Except of course for calling Earth 'Urth' -- very clever.) If anyone out there has the slightest idea what is going on in this book please post a review so I can gain enlightenment."
2,Like Wading through Hip Deep Oatmeal,"I've also been reading Sci Fi and fantasy for a long time and have never run into such a long, tedious, plotless bag of nonsense in all that time... until I started reading, then skimming then ignoring this book.I think this book is a product of the 'All form, no substance' school of writing. Dark moods, sullen characters, irrationally placed tech; be honest, did you learn anything useful about the world, yourself or others from reading the series? SOmetimes simple entertainment is good too. The world described in this series is not worth visiting.Remember, you aren't immortal. Start with masters (real ones, not those dubbed by book marketers) Heinlein, Asimov, Orson Scott Card, Anne Cafferty, Herbert (father and son) are just a few; when you've run out of all of them, maybe read this series.Sorry to be such a downer, I like a lot of different books and ideas. This one offended by wasting my time. I can get some of my money back but my time can never be replaced."
2,"Buy the Original Hong Kong Version, if at all possible","The ""Black Belt Theater"" series often leaves much to be desired. The transfer of Dance of the Drunken Mantis is so bleached out that the subtitles are often unreadable. Whenever the silver-haired Jang Lee appears, most of his face is indiscernable. What a waste of money! The picture quality on From China with Death (which is dubbed) is also horrible, but due to cropping and the dirty, VHS ""original"" that was used. I have learned my lesson with ""Black Belt Theater"": I won't buy that title again.My advice is that you go to a Hong Kong Imports film distributer and try to find ALL your kung-fu films there. Unfortunately, the vast majority of the really good, re-masters of the best martial arts films (per their original HK release version) are Region 3 encoded."
3,You get what you pay for!,"First off the picture quality is poor on both movies. ""Dance"" is widescreen but the picture's brightness is so bad that you lose the action at points and the subtitles are often unreadable. ""China""'s picture quality is fullscreen but somewhat more watchable but is taken from a VHS copy and even freezes and has tracking problems at points. ""Dance"" is the only reason to get this DVD as it is a Yuen Woo Ping movie and a sequel of sorts to Drunken Master with Jackie Chan. The action is good (when you can see what's happening) even if the storyline is missing (or not able to be read for those who don't understand Cantonese). I suggest you wait for a better version of the movie on DVD unless you absolutely must have it."
3,one of the worst transfers ever,"FROM CHINA WITH DEATH-bad picture but very watchable. But who is going to watch a movie where wu ma plays the hero. i know that I certainly never will again.DANCE OF THE DRUNKEN MANTIS-I actually like this movie better than drunken master. Not too often you will find a sequel that's better than the original. But you just don't beat the drunken masters fight!! If you can get this for like 3.99 like I did, that's the only way that I can reccommend it. When Hwang has a white backround behind him, you literally can't see him."
2,A little disappointed...,"I had great expectations to this book. Maybe they were too high. It's a nice book with lots of info, but the writer could have gone a lot further in filling out the blanks. I feel he's just scratching the surface most of the time. The info and pictures are good, but it's just like he's teasing the reader, because he stops right at the point where you only want more - and haven't got much. A lot of very important information is only just mentioned without any further explanation or diagrams or whatever. I read this from cover to cover, and every second of it I told myself that ""this is the point where he really digs in""... But alas, no....."
3,For beginners only. Lacking in inspiration.,"Attempting to be all things rarely works and this book is the embodiment of that principle.Digital Fashion Photography utterly fails as a book on photography or a book on photoshop or as a book on fashion. Yes it touches an all these subjects yet gives very, very little in-depth knowledge.I could forgive it for all the above if it at least had some inspiring fashion photography in it. Alas, most of the photographs are more glamor and beauty. Very little fashion.To add insult to injury, several of the models are obviously amateurs.If your are interested in photography, color management, photoshop or lighting there are many other; better choices. If you are interested in the business of fashion photography then buy 'Fashion Photography: A Complete Guide to the Tools and Techniques of the Trade' by Bruce Smith. A much superior work from a REAL fashion photographer.Fashion Photography: A Complete Guide to the Tools and Techniques of the Trade"
5,More,"Fantastic box set. The original movie is now hard to find and this fun little box set came with the original movie, Girl on a Bike and another soundtrack that had a lot of the music from the series. I only wish the whole series from start to finish had been released onto DVD with more soundtracks. Have been a RSD fan since the start and this is a great addition to my collection."
3,Was expecting more,"Was expecting more from the movie, can't say I really enjoyed the movie. But overall cost was OK. Item came just as it looks with box and garder around the exterior."
1,"Strong Chemical Smell, Beware","If you like resting your head on a soft pink cloud that smells like a toxic waste dump, by all means order this pillow. This thing gave me a headache just removing it from its package. I aired it out for days and it still smelled carcinogenic. I'd sure like to know what this pink stuff is made out of, but the package isn't too specific on this point. All it says is ""non-allergenic foam"" -- uh-huh. All I know is that the material doesn't come from the natural world, and no human should be breathing this stuff in for 8 hours a night. I'll go back to my old cotton pillow, thanks. Yuck."
2,Blizzard = LOUD,"This is the loudest fan we've ever owned - and unfortunately we've owned many. We cannot have it in our bedroom or the kids bedroom at night and even in the family room it's so loud we have to turn up the TV volume a bunch and it's very hard to have a conversation. We're getting rid of this ""blizzard"" fan and buying a more traditional one that's quieter."
2,Too loud,"The fan is much too loud. No matter what setting I put it on, it sounds like a blizzard in my apartment. That said, the fan itself is reasonably strong for its smaller head size."
3,"Overall good, but be careful","This fan is powerful - it's loud, but not ridiculously so - and it's always good to find a standing fan tall enough to reach most windows that actually works.My only complaint is that the connection between the top part and the bottom tube/base is flimsy, and so when manually turning the fan, the top easily comes off or the fan falls."
1,You would not be able to sleep or watch TV with this fan on it is too loud.,"This fan is too loud,if you intend to use it in your bedroom it would be impossible to sleep or watch TV with this fan on.I would not encourage any one to buy this fan."
5,Great Fan - my friend is going to buy one too,"This fan is solid, well-made, versatile and really ventilates the room well, but as with all high velocity fans it is on the loud side, even on low. It has basically three heights: you can use it as a table fan, or you can insert either or both poles to make it medium height or full standing fan height. Be forewarned though that there is a little work in doing this, but it's not difficult."
3,Very Powerfull=Very Loud,"This is by far the most powerfull fan I've owned. If you are using it during the day it's fine, but if you need this for falling asleep, avoid it. Even the lowest setting sounds like a jet engine."
4,great little fan!,Packs a punch and is very powerful and quiet for its size!We used this during the latest heat wave in NYC to help move the cool air and it worked like a charm! I would definitely recommend it!
5,keeps you COOL!!,"I LOVE this fan! It truly is a blizzard. Cheap fans don't keep you cool. Spend the money on this one, it's worth it. I live in an apartment and it helps circulate the cool air from my wall A/C. I also blow dry my hair with it by putting it on full blast lol!"
3,Nicely sized but not solidy built,"I bought this fan for our home gym. I like the size -- it's compact and just tall enough to blow air at my torso while running on our treadmill -- but be advised that means that it may be too short for other purposes. It blows a reasonable amount of air at the two lowest settings and more than I actually prefer when turned to the highest setting.The two pieces that are used to create the leg for the fan do not really lock together very well, and the head of the fan seems inclined to droop. Thus far, it has remained at the angle at which I set it, but there's no way of locking the angle into place, and with the slightest pressure on the top of the fan, it simply nods and points toward the floor.All in all, I'm a bit disappointed with the construction, but it does seems as if it will suffice for our purposes."
3,Be Carefull in . . .,. . assembling this. Its made entirely of plastic and it isn't hard to strip the pole screw threads by twisting them together too tightly rendering the fan unable to adjust height. Mine has been quietly running 24/7 for over two years now. Difficult to clean but it must be done for performance sake. I will not buy another of the same because of the plastic construction and it having a non-removable grill for cleaning. Performance: 5-stars; Craftsmanship/Design: 1-star.
4,"Nice tool, but Briggs and Stratton are not very helpful","Missing item on Troy 630C Tuffy Tiller.For Briggs and Stratton Engine, both bolts holding the bottom of the housing - item number 692198.Would you please ship two of these items?thanks,Discussion ThreadResponse (Audwin - B & S) 09/02/2004 08:52 AMThank you for contacting Briggs & Stratton E-Customer Support!Unfortunately, Briggs doesn't send anything factory-direct.

If there are any missing parts, it could have been during transport through the manufacturer or the retailer.E-Customer Support"
2,Disappointing,"I loved the Vic Fontaine character on Deep Space Nine, and so it was with great anticipation that I slipped this CD into my stereo system.But without the context of a DS9 episode, James Darren's weaknesses as a singer are impossible to ignore. As I listened to the album I couldn't help appreciating Frank Sinatra and Tony Bennett all the more.I'm happy for Darren that he's enjoying a professional renaissance as a singer, and most people apparently don't agree with me, but I won't be listening to ""This One's From the Heart"" again anytime soon. Darren is a minor league lounge singer."
1,Why bother?,"Why would you bother with a third rate effort when you can get the real thing with a CD of the same or similar songs and arrangements by the likes of Frank Sinatra, Vic Damone, Jack Jones, and numerous other real singers."
1,"DEEP SIX ""THIS ONE"" FROM DEEP SPACE NINE!!","This is the worst CD I've heard in a LONG time - it's a travesty what Darren does to these standards! The arrangements are almost all pretty boring, but Darren is the real offender - the guy just can't sing!! A pretty face does NOT make for a good singer - especially in this case!! Avoid at all costs if you're not tone-deaf and have any musical taste at all!"
5,A must buy!,"This is simply an excellent album. Having seen James play Vic Fontain on Deep Space Nine and hearing he had a CD being released that was a tribute to DS9 and all the old classics, I had to buy it. I wasn't disapointed. This CD brings those old classics back to life in a way only Darren can. It's all hear, the sax, trumpet and piano solos, the big band and a brilliant singer. You won't be disappointed with this album..."
4,fabulous gift for and DS9 fan,"I know some reviews are ripping into this cd because it's not as good as Sinatra. That's not the point of this cd. This cd is for the Deep Space: Nine fans who miss the show. Listening to the songs, I think back to the episode and what the characters were doing during that music. A great collection of songs from the show plus a few others from that era.A great gift for the DS9 fan in your life."
4,Forget Star Trek - An excellent crooner!,"I loved the character of Vic Fontaine! I think it was brilliant to have a crooner assist the DS9 crew as they dealt with the Dominion War. Putting that aside, though, this CD reminded me of a delicious blend of Tony Bennett and Mel Torme! I love crooners and ""The Best is Yet to Come"" is my favourite song of all time. Darren does an excellent job with the song, infusing it with his smooth upbeat style. I am glad that James Darren is making a bit of a comeback through DS9. In some ways, this is a great lesson for ST fans: to make a better future, we do need to enjoy and learn from the past. These songs are fresh, new and hopeful. A great CD for these war-torn times."
5,Wonderful music!,"Very good music by james darren, (also known as Vic fontaine on star trek deep space nine). We can listen to it over and over and not get tired of it. Very good singing on his part, and the background music was very well performed!"
4,Very well put together,"James Darren's sweet voice in ""I've got you under my skin,"" will melt any heart. A must-have for any oldies collection."
4,Great CD but maybe not for everyone,"It took me awhile for this CD to grow on me but now I love it! Great versions of ""Black Magic,"" ""Here's to the Losers,"" and a breathtaking arrangement of ""The Way You Look Tonight."" I haven't stopped listening to it in weeks! This CD might not be for everyone though. I also have several Sinatra albums, and while ""This One's.."" is excellent, Darren does not quite have the range and the smooth voice of Sinatra. But give it a try for those of you who are not hardcore Sinatra. Tony Bennett fans might be more forgiving. But oh so good if you loved ole Vic Fontaine. Crazy!"
3,From Your Heart to My Ears,I loved James Darren when he appeared as Vic on Deep Space Nine. The songs he sang on the show were wonderful. I wanted to experience those songs again. I do enjoy this album. The only disappointment is that James sings some of the songs with an upbeat tempo. I find myself wishing he had sung them at the speed they were ment to be sung. I wanted to enjoy the passion he can put into his singing in every song.
4,Very good album.,"Very good album for fans of the lounge/band singer sound, James Darren and Star Trek: Deep Space Nine.The mix isn't as forward and live sounding as the mix heard on DS9, but is still pretty good."
5,This one's from the Heart,"I have nothing but positive things to say about this buying experience, The CD arrived in just a few days, in perfect condition, I'm as happy as can be."
3,"Intent Win, Content Fail","As a fan of the Vic Fontane character on Star Trek: Deep Space 9, I knew I had to get this album. Sadly, I don't think I paid enough attention to the description, as I was expecting this to be a album cut from the performances on the show, only in full length of song. To clarify, I was hoping for the duet with Avery Brooks.Additionally, I am a fan of the genre of music this album represents, and while I'm therefore quite aware the songs are, and in fact need to be, interpreted by each artist lest they simply become retreads, I was not a fan of how a few track were done. In particular, ""Witchcraft"" was far faster than works for me.Overall, I think the album is still worth purchasing, if for no other reason that to support the dying genre, but it fell a little flat for me when compared against the DS9 episodes--more feeling came across on the screen."
5,This Review's From the Heart,"James Darren proves with this CD the best is yet to come from this talented singer (and amazing actor). Mr.Darren's vocals are a mixture of Frank Sintra, Dean Martin, and Tony Bennett. It is great to hear him return to the big band roots exemplified in his first LP, James Darren #1.He does excellent renditions of such favorites as ""I've Got the World on a String"" and ""The Way You Look Tonight"" and adds a dash of rediscovered tunes such as ""Satin Doll"" and ""Here's to the Losers"". And to top it off he is one of the nicest men I have ever met! Come sip martinis and dance in the dark at Mr. Darren's forthcoming performances in Vegas!Bottom Line: At 63, James Darren is still one cool cat."
5,wheels for 1991 Toy Pickup,"Ordered them, got them, and the pickup looks great. Amazon delivered exactly what I ordered and I am very pleased. the MT wheels look great and were received without any issues."
5,The New York Times Manual of Style and Usage,"A good quick reference book for any writer needing to look up the vagaries of capitalization, commas, abbreviations, titles, etc. in the English language. One caution-- this is the preferred writing style of the NY Times, which may or may not be acceptable to every reader."
2,A Disappointment,"After becoming editor of a newsletter for a national non-profit,I bought this book on the highest recommendation by a friend who knows a lot more about journalism than I do. (I am a writer, though, having taught English in H.S. for many years.) I found looking up material in this book frustrating: much of the time my efforts were fruitless. Eventually I began to expect lack of success, no matter how many different doors I used. Once in a while I'd be pleasantly surprised.My ancient, beloved stalwart, Warriner's ""English Grammar and Composition,"" was much more productive as a reference resource."
5,THEORY,A PRESENT FOR MY DAUGHTER IN LAW HOW JUST GRADUATED FROM JOURNALISM.SHE FOUND IT COMPLETE AND INTERESTING. THANKS.
4,A useful reference guide for writers,"Before buying this 1999 edition, I used an edition that was published in the early 1970s. That edition prohibited writers from using the word ""councilwoman"". I was curious whether a more recent edition would change this prohibition.I see that the 1999 edition does permit the use of councilwoman.I don't understand why the Manual doesn't use U.S.A., as an abbreviation. It uses only U.S."
1,Don't buy this.,"This is a book which will tell you that using ""data"" as a plural is ""stilted and deservedly obscure"". This book essentially surveys the current mis-use of language and writes it down for all to follow. I expect they would have to issue a new version every year to keep up with the drift, which I suppose would be a good money-maker for the publisher."
4,Next best thing,"If you want to get ahead in journalism - and don't fancy sleeping your editor - this book is priceless. Clean copy, with no spelling mistakes and correct word usage is all anyone can ask for. Some noticable omissions though."
5,a must have cd for EVERYONE,"This cd is completely different from their first album. their first one featured dirt as the main rapper. The old cd was more gangster hardcore style, which was tight, but their new one is the opposite. This is more white boy style since the main rapper is a white guy. This cd is one of the best i've ever heard. The BEATS ARE PHAT!!! from emotional ones like Family Ties to fast flows like PUlling A Fast ONe. The Lyrics are very contravresial because they're true and people are afraid to hear the truth. I reccomand this cd to cgristians and non christians. whether you like emenem style or hard flows with tight beats.(dirt is feat. on some songs but most the folks aren't the same as the old sackcloth cd)"
1,what do you mean you cant pick 0 stars???,"this cd is garbage. please do not buy this cd. you will regret it. let me start off by saying that I am a big Secular rap listener. and no, violence / foul language isnt my main reasons for listening to secular music. My main reason for listening to secular music is because the beats are slammin. The first thing you hear on the song is the beats. then the lyrics kick in. This cd had some corny beats. A monkey on a drum set could have done better than what they did. i listened to the cd once and that was enough. they may have good jesus related music and they had a good rappin style but the best lyrics in the world could help the beats they brought to the table. to anyone who listens to secular rap and is looking for christian rap avoid this one. There are better Christain rap artist out there"
2,A lightweight field reference.,"This is more of an illustrated checklist. Being the size that it is, and that it aims to be a field guide, it is a shame to have given it a hardcover. The overall arrangement is a bit unwieldy: the range maps for example are in a separate section to the species accounts, which are very brief and make too much use of symbols and abbreviations.The plates are quite overcrowded. The illustrations lack charm, depth or texture in my opinion.Although it is superceded by other field guides, it still serves as a handy checklist (if you are already familiar with identifying most of the birds) and need a quick field reference."
2,Get CD's instead,"I highly recommend every Orozco CD out there, they're all 5-star quality. TBut sadly, this DVD is a big disappointment. The quality of the video and the camera shots are amateur at best. In many verses of the songs the children's mouths are moving but there are no children's voices, just Orozco's. It looks as though someone took a video of a TV show and then patched in the CD for audio in the spots where the video camera couldn't pick up the TV sound well enough.I hope someone gets some good video of this wonderful singer while he's still with us."
4,My son loves this video,"My dad bought this video for my one-year old for his birthday along with the a few CDs and one of the books. My son loves this video and asks for it everyday. We literally play this video in my house at least 3 or 4 times a day. He likes the CDs too, but as one reviewer stated, this really brings the songs to life. I agree with another reviewer that the video quality isn't great, but my son doesn't seem to mind. We've played other videos for him of some other children's artists and he wasn't as interested. Perhaps it's the children he's drawn to in this one or the fact that there is a little animation in the video, but this one is his all-time favorite. I highly recommend it for any parent of a toddler."
2,The loved and the Lost Interest,"After reading this book, I have lost total respect for this author (Morley Callaghan). The book is highly redundant, and I think that it should be discredited from his list of works. I have read a few of his books over the year such as Such is my Beloved and More Joy in heaven, and this book by far has been the worst. He tries to capture the essence of a segregated society in 1950's Montreal, as well as a love story, which I was led to believe was between a Caucasian male and an afro-canadian female, but instead he told a story of a caucasian female that was unaccepted by both races, and that repeated its events throughout the book. This unexpectedaspect, which I suppose was there to change things up, in a way cheapened the story. A variation of the events leading up to the climax would have made for a better plot. Overall, this book did not deserve the governor generals award that it received, and truly is not one of Callaghans best works."
4,Good Read,Great little guide for the ageing pilgrim. The author has a sense of humor. It was interesting to see where she stayed and where she avoided. Enjoyed the references to the history and the medieval journals.
3,good but not great,"This model toasts well, bakes well, and the convection feature is a plus. However... the insulation is poor so the oven gets hot to the touch. Also, for the price, the construction feels flimsy. It is however a very good performer. Could be 4-5 stars with better heat insulation."
4,"Fun, large, and a stuffed toy worth having","I'm not a fan of stuffed toys that seem to multiply as kids get older. But this snake is large and durable, with a soft plush. My 4 year old loves it - plays with it during the day and then wraps it around her bed at night to keep her company. I have four of these and think they are a great little item."
5,Savor every word,"It has been years since I've read a book that I did not want to put down. I wanted each page to last longer, and I truly savored each word. I shared it with friends, and they felt the same about this book. My book club read The Memory of Old Jack and had the opportunity to speak with the author. This made the experience even more enjoyable. This now ranks highest on my list of favorites.If you are a fan of Wallace Stegner, you will begin to wonder if Wendell Berry is your favorite author after you read this work of literature."
1,Really boring!,"Wow, what a surprise! I bought this book after reading all of the very positive reviews. What a mistake! I suppose you might like this book if you like really slow moving books that will put you to sleep. For a much better work of fiction, I recommend City of Thieves."
4,A four-star Wendell Berry book is better than a five-star anything-else-book,"Of the three novels I have read by Wendell Berry, this is my third favorite (behind Jayber Crow and Hannah Coulter). But it is still so very good -- one I will read again."
3,A very introductory set,"I agree that Before Your Pregnancy can be helpful, if any experience with nutrition or a healthy lifestyle is limited. It covers the basics, but doesn't help too much with specifics. But the fact that it puts the responsiblity of parenting, before and during pregnancy, in the hands of mother and father is perhaps the best introduction it can provide."
1,AWFUL,"The worst book I have ever read in my life. Joseph Cummings is actually the author in disguise, don't be fooled, readers. This book will disgust you with its inaccuracies and poor scholarship."
4,Good Book,"This book actually talks about each member of the Huxtable family and tells about their own persona lives off the set. It's a fun book. I think there needs to be an updated version made. This book taught me what Rudy (Keisha) enjoys doing back stage and also some things about the other characters too. A good book for those whom are just starting out with ""The Cosby Show"" and also a nice book for those of us old timers who like to know the personalities of each member of the Huxtable family at the time of the making of the great and wonderful ""The Cosby Show."""
4,Objectivity at it's best,With so many biased books out there - it's refreshing to read something that's actually objective. The various authors and experts that contributed to this book is like a who's-who in the debate over euthenasia. If you have a family member with a terminal illness - this is the must-read book.
4,LOVE IT!,This is such a great book.. Sure its just like the normal edition of AWTR but this one just touches my soul. I dunno why.. the picture of Mandy moore and Shane West on the front or just the discriptions? You have GOT to get this!
4,Fascination With Evil ~ The Journey Begins,"University History Professor Jeffrey Burton Russell has spent more time researching and writing on the concept of evil and the possible existence of the Devil than anyone else I can think of. His interest in the ""Infernal One"" began while in college and has fascinated him ever since.'The Devil: Perceptions of Evil from Antiquity to Primitive Christianity constitutes volume one of a four volume set. While the good Catholic professor does inject his personal beliefs and impressions here and there this is primarily a historical work so if you're looking for tales of demonic possession and lurid activities done in the dark you'll be bitterly disappointed. However if you are one of those people fascinated with the darkside of God and want to build a strong historical foundation for further studies start reading. When your finished you'll only have three more volumes to go!"
4,A step up.,"Mayor returns with Joe Gunther - a Brattleboro, Vermont police detective. The third installment in the long running series finds Brattleboro in the grips of a calculating killer. A young stockbroker is found buried in a recent road project. Clues are minimal and when a local small town hood is killed the police are pressed for results.The small town police department of Brattleboro is ill-equiped to deal with a serial criminal. Pressure builds as more bodies are found. Gunther and his staff are stretched thin and cracks in the department are showing. Is one of their own a killer?Much better effort than the previous book but a little long. And a mistake made by the chief and Gunther in the first book is repeated. We are supposed to believe Joe is smart and a moral man, it seemed a lesson he would have learned.I'll keep reading ...."
4,Riveting Mystery,"This was a no put down novel. I only discovered the Joe Gunther series a few months ago and I enjoy reading all of them. I have started reading them in order.He has a wave of putting you in the little town of Brattleboro, VT, and his descriptions are vivid.I will definitely read the rest of his series."
5,Another Archer Mayor hit!,"Reading the third of the Joe Gunther series and I find that each book has just locked onto me and I could not put them down. Mayor makes you feel that you are part of the story - turns and twists that you don't see coming, make this series one of the better mystery books on the market. i highly recommend the series!"
3,Easy read,"I enjoy the Archer Mayor Joe Gunther series. It's not too tough going intellectually, just nice simple relaxing entertainment, a good story and easy read. Mayor's plot lines continue to improve as the series develops."
5,Scent of Evil (Joe Gunther #3) (Joe Gunther Mysteries),Just started reading Mayor novels this year. I enjoy his style and really liked this book I was sorry when it was finished.
3,Small town police,"This is the third book in the series and I read it first. Mr. Mayer has way too many plots and subplots to keep the book flowing. He has everybody in town as a suspect except poor old janitor BUDDY who keeps showing up every other page. He should have put a tag on him stating ""I am the pervert and killer"" since do one loved him. Gunther seems to be investivating everyone except the obvious. Small town and too much intrique."
1,An unedited overwritten police procedural,"Joe Gunther of the Brattleboro, VT police force finds himself involved in a complex case involving multiple murders and drugs. There are also subplots concerning cover-ups, Joe's relationship with his significant other, and city politics. By the time the case is resolved, long after I ceased to care one way or the other, the author has written over 400 pages of uneven prose, punctuated, to be fair, by occasional dramatic episodes. However, there are way too many comments from Gunther about the complexity of the case, the political danger of the police proceeding as they do, and Gunther's hope that with just one more clue, the case will be solved. So get on with it already! This book needed to be edited down to about two-thirds of its published length. Compare this to tighter writing by Andrew Garve or Ed McBain and you will really notice the difference."
5,Scent of Evil (Joe Gunther #3) (Joe Gunther Mysteries),"Excellent reading. I must admit to being a Joe Gunther fan, obviously that makes me a fan of the author, Archer Mayor, as well. This book is definitey a 'can't put down' book. Absolutely compulsive reading."
5,A Light in the Storm,"Hey, I just got this book is the mall. The pictures are great. I like this book especially because I have a house a mile from Fenwick Island."
5,Very Good!,"A wonderful book about Amelia Martin, a 15 year old girl whohelps to run a lighthouse on Fenwick Island. Life isn't always easythough. Her father is an Abolitionist and her mother is a Confederate. Not only that, her friend doesn't talk to her anymore because her father is a confederate and doesn't want his daughter to be friends with her. This is one of my favorite Dear America books in the series."
5,A Light in the Storm,"Okay. I know. Nobody's read the book yet, but gee, you really can't help being a cridic! The Civil War is one of my favorite subjects to study, in fact, I did a whole project on it for nothing. I've read pretty much the whole series and so far, about 7% of the books were not 5 star work. There's only one thing I'm curious about. Why write and publish a book about the Civil War when there is already a book about the same thing in this series, not to mention it was the FIRST book in the series! Oh, well. Who cares? It sounds like it will be getting straight 5's from now on, especially from me!"
2,"Not a ""feel good"" story","This book is not up to the usual standard of the Dear America series. I think it would be enjoyed more by older readers (13+)than younger as it does not have as much ""action"" as the other books. This book has a more philosophical bent. The book is not one I would buy, I recommend getting it from the library instead.I find it very very hard to believe that the parents in the story would actualy get divorced, live separately - sure, but divorce in that day and age - no."
1,Dry and Boring,"This book is cerainly an exception to the ""rule"" that ""Dear America"" books are always good. I don't know...it just didn't draw me in. I couldn't finish it (a rare thing for someone who finishes a book 99% of the time!) and there really didn't seem to be any action, save for Amelia endlessly tending her lighthouse. Her family relationships were a little strange and unrealistic, too...I thought divorce really NEVER happened back then. This diary seems more focused on HISTORY than PEOPLE, and I think ""people-focused"" historical fiction is what makes the ""Dear America"" books so believable and well liked. I was disappointed by this book...but don't worry, you really can expect more for almost any other ""Dear America"" book."
4,Pretty good,"This was a pretty good book. I would not say it was one of my favorites because some parts were confusing, especially the poem her uncle writes in the front of the diary. I would recommend it to older DA readers, maybe for ages 11-14. It's not because it's gruesome or anything, just a little more advanced reading level."
1,Not what I expected,"The description for this item is not accurate. I bought the freeze deied raspberries and stawberries from this same company and they are great. However, these are dehydrated which means 2 important things:- Texture: these are very hard and do not soften if left in milk or water. Don't think about adding these to cereal, only for trail mix or eating out of hand.- Saturated fat: the second ingredient is coconut oil! One 2oz. serving has 190 calories, 19 grams of fat and 16 grams of saturated fat. You're better off eating Cheetos.These are extremely unhealthy and don't even taste that great. There is (unsurprisingly) and oily aftertaste. Buyer beware. Stick to purely freeze dried fruits - nothing is added and they are healthy."
1,hard as rocks,The dehydrated Banana Chips are coated in a hard sugar substance. This food product is too hard for the average person to safely consume.The coating on the chips make the chip almost like biting into a ice cube. I had to throw them out. Not worth breaking a tooth - why they had to cover the banana chips I have no idea -- I have purchased other dehydrated banana chips - different companies - and never encountered this issue before. Dont buy this item.
5,Great for snacking,"I never got around to trying to bake with these because I just used them as a snack rather than regular chips or sweets. I think these would be great in trail mix or just plain as I've been eating them. I don't eat massive quantities of them, so I'm not concerned about the coconut oil or the small amount of sugar added. I just eat them to take the edge off hunger sometimes between meals. Honeyville does sell freeze-dried bananas though if you're concerned about additives."
4,One percent nation,"If you want to know, listen...Ice T speaks, for over three hours, on everything from race and racism, rap, and religion!The only other person who has anything near to the quality, scope, and thought provoking opinions set forth on this album, is the original instigator himself, Jello Biafra.Do yourself a favor; get it while it's here to be got."
2,Terrible transfer,"The visuals are dirty! For a price tag of nearly $60 you'd expect them to clean up the original tapes they had in archive for this DVD release, but no. Ou can see artifacts everywhere. Also, how come AnimeWorks couldn't dub this like they did for other anime series? One more thing, even back in the 1980s, Americanized Voltron had stereo sound, but Golion only has mono! Having stereo sound back in the 80s was an incredible feat, but if Voltron could have it, why not Golion? This DVD release is in mono only, Japaneae only, and a poor visual transfer. Why they chose not to clean up the dirt and restore it is beyond me. This set is only worth $10, not the $60 they are cheating people out of. I watched Golion back in the day, and it was much better before all the years of dirt got to it."
1,seriously...,"I cannot reiterate enough how irritated this book made me. Honestly, she sees him with a concubine--i wanted to shoot them all. She walks into his room to find said concubine in his bed--slit throats. When she's pregnant, he gets married AGAIN--toss the book at a wall, scream in rage, tear out intestines. At the end, ""I was never with them...."" (NOT A REAL SENTENCE) SERIOUSLYYYYYYYYY??????? WHAT THE HECK? If you like jealousy, go for it. If not, don't even look. And i agree with some reviews, she is rescued way too much for an amazing heroine. The summary on the back is terribly misleading...don't believe it."
2,If you read romance to be uplifted do not touch this book !!,"I don't know why someone would write a romance novel based on Alexander the Great as we all know it ends badly.I also don't know what I was thinking in picking it up, mabey it was the cover, mabey I thought that the couple would be happy in the end before he dies so young and have a happy hopeful ending for the woman.Boy was I wrong !!!If you wish to be deperessed this book is great for you.They are always arguing and never truley work it out right up to the end and the woman goes on to have a depressing and horrible end.If you look at romance novels to have at least a glimmer of happiness at the end don't bother with this."
1,I want my 6 hours back!!,"I was very disappointed in this book. I didn't like the way the ""hero"" acted and I did not enjoy how he treated his ""heroine"". It may have been historically accurate, but if you read romance novels for warm and fuzzy tales of true love, DON'T BOTHER READING THIS BOOK.The hero, and I use this term very loosely in this case, is arrogant, selfish, delusional, politically nieve twards his companions, and completely clueless about the inner workings of women.The heroine is childish and prideful, but is good with weaponry which may be of some interest to feminists.I was surprised that it didn't have a traditional type ending, but historcally it remained true. To a point. (If my memories of high school are correct, Alexander the Great died of VD)The only thing worse than paying full price for this book, is that I wasted the time to read it. If you want to read this book, please go to a library."
1,Not for me,"This is not romance. Nor did it end happily. The hero treated his woman badly and I could not like him at all...and the heroine was annoying because she put up with it. I wish I had my .50 cents I paid for it back. And also the couple of hours I wasted on it. Please beware, even though this book is labeled as historical romance IT IS NOT. It left me cold while reading it and also at the end."
3,Someone blow up his piano - please!!!,"Overall, this album is pretty good. That said, someone needs to find Zakk's piano and blow it the F up. There are about six too many ballads on this album. I think it's funny how Zakk considers himself an outsider, but produces songs that sound like everyone else. I swear, if I hear another piano-based song with strings behind it, I'm just going to implode.With an album title like ""Shot to Hell,"" you expect every song to be an arse kicker. There are some good ones on here, but I think Zakk was way too in touch with his feminine side while making this album.Ok, I'm fine now.I think my favorite track on the album is ""New Religion."" Once you suffer through the opening piano, the song gets really heavy and moody. Like the lyrics a lot too.It's not that I'm against the piano or anything, but you kind of expect lots of guitar work from someone like Zakk. Who knows, maybe he'll focus on the tuba next album to really show us how great of a musician he is."
3,He can generate better albums,"While this album does have great sound, excellent guitar riffs and carries a certain 'something' due to the fact that it is BLS, its mediocrity is at times upsetting. The simplicity is what gets to me. When your song structures are simply verse-chorus-verse-chorus SOLO verse-chorus-verse-chorus it's a bit of a let down. Where is the musical complexity of Blessed Hellride? Not to mention the lyrical simplicity as well. The verses are repeated as though they're all choruses. My personal opinion is that attempting to put out an album per year causes a certain dilution of the music you're producing. Maybe it's Zakk, maybe it's Roadrunner. I don't know. But while this album is a good listen, it's not Hellride, and not what Zakk Wylde & Co. are truly capable of."
3,It's definately Zakk Wylde,"You really know what you're getting when you buy a Black Label Society album. Zakk Wylde has the potential to finally come out of Ozzy's shadow but he never does. That's not to say his music is not good, I love almost everything he has put together. The problem is he's too predictable with what he's going for...and this album is no different than anything else he's put out. If you want classic metal than Black Label Society is the newest reincarnation you can find, when he wants some mellow stuff, he does it great and even his southern rock (Pride & Glory) bit is great but he follows the same formula throughout the different styles.I love Zakk Wylde but sometimes I wish he could change things up..."
1,Stop making cds.,"Alot of it sounded like some of his old stuff and some songs sounded the same its a shame because I am a fan of BLS,SDMF."
5,"Alcohol Fueled, Pure Old School Metal","Fans of Mafia should enjoy this new release from Black Label Society. I like the fact that the songs are shorter in length, most clocking in under 4 minutes. The album is a mixture of Rockers and Ballads. Some may complain that too many ballads are featured, but ballads have always been a part of BLS, and every Ballad on this album is excellent. The best of the heavier songs are Black Mass Reverends and Blacked Out World, 2 of the best BLS songs to date. New Religion starts off with a slow intro then kicks into full gear with a great riff and blazing guitar work - the best song on the album, in my opinion. Nothing's the Same is the best of the Ballads. Shot to Hell ranks right up there with Blessed Hellride and Mafia as the best albums in the Black Label Society catalog."
4,There is nothing wrong with being Shot to Hell...,"I don't understand why so many people dog this band? Sure, Zakk Wylde sounds a bit like Ozzy, but since when was that a bad thing? He is a very talented singer, with an enormous range from ballads to headbanging, and his guitar work (although he is a bit cocky about it) is indisputably impressive.I see nothing particularly wrong with this album. Maybe the songs are a bit uneven, with too many ballads laced in, but that's about it. I really like BLS, and I really like ""Shot to Hell"", with ""Concrete Jungle"" being one of my new favorite songs by them. If you like BLS, there is no reason to not like this album. Period."
1,"Zakk's trying to change, but it's for the worse","Zakk's either getting too old to be heavy or is trying to get more radio play through softer songs, but it doesn't work for me. The slow, elton-john-wannabe songs will make you roll your eyes in boredom, and the lyrics are very lame.Zakk's strenghs are about heavy headbanging beer-swilling rythm that makes you want to raise hell like it's 1985, but you won't find that here, except for his single ""Concrete Jungle"". Even the album cover is a disappointment as it looks like something you'd see on a Weird Al album, not Zakk's.I give it 1 star for Concrete Jungle, I refuse to pay over 10 bucks for just one song though."
2,Very disappointed,Zakk won me over on one CD. He pretty much lost me on this one!Anybody interested in two tickets for the Chicago show at the Congress Theater?
1,Rubbish!,How does Zakk Wylde get away with peddling the same old trash. Spend your money on something better... like a banana skin drying rack.
3,More Book of Shadows than Hangover Music,"There has been much made here of how this album is not as intense as some Black Label Society CDs. I would agree that is the case. However, some of the best songs of BLS have always been the ballads. Zakk is a fine rock songwriter no matter if he chooses to slow things down or not.Speaking of the album in question (Shot to Hell), however, the songwriting is not as tight as on some previous albums. Bluntly put, I find this work to be mostly an inferior copy of what has gone before.For casual or new listeners, I suggest picking up 'Mafia' if you like BLS's rockers and 'Hangover Music' if you prefer the ballads.This album isn't a total wash and I will listen to it in the future, but what it does best is point the listener to the rest of Black Label Society's excellent back catalogue."
1,waste of time and money,"ZW has completely sold out... this album is pure mediocre mush, overproduced, underwritten, and as other reviewers have stated headed directly for the .99 cent bin. Bland mush metal, with nothing to stir the soul, or boil the blood. Zakk is over,save your $$just my humble opinion, and where is my guitar?"
2,collecting dust somewhere,"After the crappy Mafia, things continue to get worse for BLS. After 15 strait listens this album is only barley listionable. Some of the ballads are ok, but that seems to be all this album has. I dont know what the hell happened to ZAKK after 1919 Eternal, but since then the band just went down hill."
1,Run of the mill nu-Wylde,"Just another boring album from another nu-metal band with a bunch of cheap guitar ""ehhh's"" put in zack style. I hate his guitar playing."
2,"Good graphics, weak content","If you've never used any 2007/2010 MS Office app before, then you'll find this book useful. If say, for instance, you're well versed in Excel and want to port some of those skills over to learn Access, then you'll be frustrated. This book covers the very basics. It tells you how to do those basics, but never why. I'm an experienced dBase programmer from the good ole days, and I'm still trying to find the structural elements to build end user applications in Access using this book as a reference. I had hoped this book would guide me there, but again, it's far too basic. This would be a great book for your daughter's six-grade class."
5,Wonderful story!,I was thrilled to find this book as it is a story written about my husband's great-uncle who came to America from France and settled with the Indians in Northern Michigan. It is a beautifully written story. Good reading for anyone interested in history.
4,Good enough I'm buying another,"Have had this fan for three years in two different apartments. It has been turned on at least 12 hours a day/night for three summers and is still working just like it did when I first got it. Very quiet. Sturdy base. In moving between apts the front cover fell off. It's a bit of a chore to get it back on, but you can do it. Besides that, the swivel head (with the dial) isn't as sturdy as the rest of the fan - but it's never been a problem. Need another for a different room and am buying the same again."
1,Dissapointing,The fan was 2 weeks old and suddenly died. The motor burnt out. What a dissapointment!
4,"I'm happy, its a good fan","I just got the fan and was able to install it in 20 minutes without any hassle. I followed the directions letter by letter and whazaam, I had a working fan!The fan is powerful and very cooling and I like it a lot. On high, I can feel the effects of it in my bedroom when its on in the living room (I live in an apartment). Its not loud. I slept with it on low last night without a problem.The only not-so-good trait is that the fan cover is not built to actaully snap securely into the fan base so it sort of just balances there. I suspect when I move it from room to room it may sometimes fall off and have to be re-balanced. Except for that, the fan is very sturdy and secure. I could see banging into it without knocking it over and no injury to the fan even if it was dropped or something (except the fan cover would fall off)."
5,Living Your Strengths: Discover Your God-Given Talents and Inspire Your Community (,Excellent book. We are using it with all our staff and small groups in our congregations.
5,Living your Strengths,Most helpful for my ministry in the Church and for my work with the team I work with. I found it most helpful.
3,Not the Catholic edition?,"I was looking for the Catholic edition of this book, and searched for 'Living Your Strengths Catholic' on Amazon, which led me to this product. The Kindle edition is the 2008 version, even though the product information says it was published in Oct 2004. Combing through the 50 reviews for this item, I found a separate link for the Catholic edition, which I couldn't find through the Amazon search. The Gallup page makes it clear that there are 'Protestant' and 'Catholic' versions of this book. This is a downside to Amazon's lumping their related product reviews together."
1,Marketing Scheme,"Once the access code from the inside jacket is used, it can never be used again. This means that you cannot buy this book used, borrow a copy from a friend, or even share it with a spouse. It seems like a marketing scheme to sell more books. We keep having to buy new copies for each member of our family. Owning 4 of these books is ridiculous!"
3,Gallup Goes On and On,"More ideas from the people that brought you ""Discover Your Strengths."" In this case they take on a religious bent in explaining how to use your innate talents to discover your place in moving christianity forward. A fairly simplistic look and quick read. Nothing really new in terms of life-altering ideas on how to direct your talents."
1,Living Your Strengths,"This book was listed as a new book. The book itself was in good, like-new condition. However, there was a one-time use code needed to complete a strengths finder examination and this code was already used! So, I am able to read the book, but it doesn't do me much good since I am unable to take the strengths finder. I was VERY disappointed! I bought the book because it was listed as NEW and it was NOT new - in fact it was used to the point of being useless!"
3,good,"I was very excited to receive this book, as I had recently been to a workshop at a conference singing the praises of the Gallup-developed strength finder system."
4,Good Help,Helps in finding your personal areas of strength so you can build upon them as oppossed to spending too much time and energy with areas in your personal make-up that will constantly be a struggle. The online profile help is very helpful.
5,Order it regularly!,I order a BOX of these about once a quarter and give them out as I meet with our Catholic pastors in the Archdiocese of Atlanta. Most excellent book.
5,Love learning,This is a fantastic book. If you lead in a church and desire to pastor a church of contributors and not consumers then you need to know their themes. You need to know the strengths of your team as well. This book provides a wonderful tool.
3,Living Your Strengths: Discover Your God-Given Talents and Inspire Your Community,"While this book was a good read, I was disappointed when I went online to take the included test. There is a newer version of the test available, but it doesn't jive with the book, so I was stuck taking the older version of the test. They need to update the book to go with the updated test. The test did describe 4 out of five of my strengths very accurately, but one was way off base, in my opinion."
2,Commercial,"The concept of the book is good. The need for personal assessment is real. But from the start it is obvious that this is a commercial to buy more products, not a standard textbook."
3,Bewitching!,"The rocking action of this little enchantress will bring a smile to your face. Putting it together, however, is quite challenging, especially when attaching the witch to the broom and to the internal mechanism. In addition, the tie rod is too weak and tends to twist when operating the crank. I'm buying a second one and will reinforce that tie rod so the mechanism will remain operable."
1,The Original Death Panel Propoasl,MSM (Main Stream Media) are lying through their teeth (unlikely anyone in that business who is poo-pooing the idea of death panels even remembers/knows about how this book relates to the current debate). Death Panels are a very real possibility. This book has been at the heart of such proposals for years. Many have been outraged by this book especially since its author's views on other issues have been adopted by the American Medical Association. A book that counters these views and sounded the alarm almost 2 decades ago isSet No Limits: A Rebuttal to Daniel Callahan's Proposal to Limit Health Care for the Elderly.Something wicked this way comes.
1,medical ageism is extermination of the weak,"Callahan's arguments for healthcare rationing based on age are neither valid, nor logical. More importantly they are not consistent with the United States Federal Civil Rights laws that are enforced by the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) of the U. S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), nor are they moral in the international community by review of the United Nation's Universal Declaration of Human Rights. http://www.un.org/Overview/rights.html"
3,"Fun and Boogie. After all, this is rock and roll","o.k., this is not Chuck at his best (as you can see in the ""face au public"" video recorded in Brussels in 1965) but I think it's worth seeing. His guitar playing is enough focused and the band is tight, with a good piano player. After all, with no soundcheck at all, they're rockin' pretty well especially in Let It Rock, Johnny B. Goode and Nadine. After all, you don't have a great choice of video documents to catch Chuck's magic chemistry. After all, this is rock and roll."
3,Glad I recorded it from TV.,"I haven't seen all of this, yet, but while it's an interesting look at the films and film makers - an interesting documentary - I'm glad I got it off of TV - I would't want to buy it or own it. I plan to erase it after I have seen it."
4,A Glance at the Second Golden Age of Cinema,"""Easy Riders, Raging Bulls"" is an orgy for movie lovers. How can anyone who loves film not be in heaven at the constant parade of landmark films and key industry figures that charges across the screen in this fast-paced documentary? If you've read the book, the movie will feel cursory, and one will find himself wishing for more detail, more insider stories. There are curious omissions here, and wonders if Bowser structured his content based on who he could get to agree to interviews. Altman is hardly mentioned, Scorsese (who shows up everywhere talking about movies) is not interviewed, and Kubrick isn't mentioned at all (save for one shot of the ""2001"" poster). Still, what's there is great, and if you're like me, you'll be left with a twinge of sadness that such a rich time in film artistry seems to be gone forever.Grade: A-"
3,Partial History,"of the shift from producers to directors. Obviously 1960's audiences wanted movies that were gritty and bold. As always, actors like Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda are given way too much emphasis and the same 5 or 6 American directors always get lumped together when their work couldn't be any more different. I would like to see more of the forgotten ""one hit wonders"" of the 1970's cinema."
5,A Worthy Addition to Your Library,"I bought the CD to get Shaw's version of Vivaldi's Gloria. It is glorious. Regardless of the musical style, Shaw's approach always makes music worth listening to. I'm not sure one can find that level of competence in contemporary recordings. It was digitally recorded in December of 1988. btw, the Bach is good too."
3,Harder than I expected,"My vet had a rubber brush like this on her counter, which I liked very much. When I got home, I searched online and found this one. It turned out to have much harder bristles than the one at the vet, so it wasn't as soothing to my 23-year-old cat as I had hoped; however, I occasionally comb her with it."
3,"effective, but hairy","This item removes hair better than anything else I've ever used and my cat loves it. However, it doesn't collect and hold the hair like a regular comb or brush does, so you wind up with tons of loose hair floating about."
3,"Better than the alternatives, but...",I bought this case rather than the more common nokia case because it protected the very soft faceplate of the phone. In use though it is a mixed blessing since you cannot see the screen to see if there was a missed call or message without removing it from the case. Another nit is that it uses a leather loop with 2 snaps instead of a clip so you cannot just slide it on and off of a belt.
4,"Great Case, Almost","I really like this case a lot. Because it holds the phone sideways (parallel to your waist), it is much less obtrusive than just about anything else you can hang from your belt. I also like the fact that the case can be hooked on your belt without taking the belt off because it attaches using a wide loop that wraps around the belt and closes with two snaps. The only negative is that the snaps that close the loop are very weak and often come open.Other pluses: The case protects the phone well, including the face; earphone and charger jacks are accessible with the phone in the case; quick access to the phone."
4,Best of what's available for the 8260,"Snaps are imperfect, but overall this is a pretty goodleather case. I'd rather see a clip on the back thandual snaps. The front snap seems to be magnetic and sofar anyway is working fine. Mostly what I like about thisis that it's attractive and horizontal."
1,passionless,"I am sorry to say that this is the most disappointing CD I have ever purchased. The interpretation is way too ethereal for Rachmaninoff. I've listened to it several times now to try to figure out what's wrong, and I think it's this. Shaw goes for a totally legato line, which is great as far as it goes, but it smooths out the accents; and Rachmaninoff's music is much more varied than that. The parts that are supposed to sound like tranquil prayers do, but Shaw makes the parts that are supposed to sound like Russian folk tunes (no. 15) or dances (no. 7) or cries from the heart (no. 5) all sound like tranquil prayers too. Buy a Russian recording, if you want to hear real passion."
1,VALERY POLYANSKY'S VERSION IS BETTER,It just is. Deal with it. Buy it here: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002T2QC4/ref=pd_sbs_m_3/103-2962540-4613441?%5Fencoding=UTF8&v;=glance&n;=5174Trust me on this. Russians sing their own music better than non-Russians. This is a fact. Polyansky's version is more beautiful. This is also a fact.So that's that.
5,Rachmaninoff's Vespers,"This beautiful piece of music was conducted by Robert Shaw, in my opinion the best choral conductor I know of. I have sung in choruses, whose conductors were trained by Shaw, and the perfection they reach for is nonpareil. Vespers is hauntingly Russian."
4,"An excellent, short history","This compact and well-written book from Soviet historian Peter Kenez is an excellent short history of the Soviet Union.Perhaps the most welcome aspect of Kenez's book is his willingess to acknowledge the centrality of ideological considerations in shaping both the views and policies of the USSR's Marxist leaders. While this is not surprising given the author's previous interest in the ""propaganda state,"" it is a needed corrective to the excessive emphasis on ""social factors"" that tend to dominate other histories of the USSR.Readers would have benefited from a more detailed bibliography or, better, a list of recommended readings from the author."
1,"Cold War Political Pamphlet, not a serious reasearch","This is a very shallow, biased piece of Cold War style journalism disguised as a historical research. The book is full of ungrounded generalizations and direct factual lies (I cannot call them mistakes, since the author must be familiar with archival data that give evidence to the contrary). All this is is tailored with one obvious goal in mind: to present the USSR in the worst possible light, demonise its leaders, slander its people, and discredit the socialist idea as such. You will know and understand less about Soviet Union after you have read this book than you do already. Do not waste your time, read serious, balanced scholarship instead."
5,WE NEED THIS MOVIE BACK IN PRINT!!!!,I love this movie. I absolutly adore every aspect of it. I think the children of today need it back!
4,Childhood Dreams Remembered,"I watched this film a lot when I was a small child and I just reciently found it on the previously viewed cart at blockbuster and picked it up. It's grand and it really pulls at your heart strings through the whole film. It's great for those who collect rare anime. It's from the makers of Hello Kittie, Sanrio."
5,All time classic,"This movie was my fav when I was a little kid. It still is my fav! Everytime Unico would morph, this tense emotion would over come me and I would cry like a baby! It is just so beautiful! The way he was just taken away from his mamma ah! It just is amazing! I recommend anyone who has kids: pass this all time classic to them and see them ""feel""!"
5,Unico is absolutely the most imaginative cartoon!,"Like everyone else who has written a review for this cartoon, I too remember this great story as memories from my childhood. I used to scramble to the t.v. everytime it came on the disney channel. Unfortunately, I usually caught it half way through. Anyway, Unico is definately memorable and I would love to watch it again. The year 2000 is too far away! Please re-release this classic!"
4,Great for anyone in love with unicorns...,"This animated feature is great for children and adults alike. The magic of the unicorn and great adventures are all balled up into this adorable blue unicorn. I was so disappointed that it was out of print, but having it come out in 2000 makes me anxious to buy it. If you haven't seen it, do!"
5,fantastic friendship,This movie is about a little unicorn who teaches different characters about friendship. It is a classic. It stopped being printed in the 80's. A wonderful family film. Beautiful graphics and wonderful characters such as Katie the Witch Kitty and Beastle the devil.
5,"The First, And Still Greatest, Anime I Have Ever Seen","I remember seeing The Fantastic Adventures Of Unico for the first time as a defining moment in my life: the first time I ever saw anime. It's got a great story and beautiful animation. I've been fortunate enough to own this movie for 10 years, since I was 4, and I still watch it. Of course, my copy is old and worn out, so I hope they do re-release it in 2000 so I can get a new copy!"
5,Desperately Seeking Unico,"One plaintive afternoon, I was unexpectedly gripped with oddly disarming memories of a childhood film which I held quite dear in my more formative years... Searching the depths of my conscience, I was able to recall strikingly vivid imagery pertaining to this achingly beautiful film which I had so loved as a child. Yet, I found myself unable to verbalize these haunting memories to others, and thus my search remained unfulfilled... Finally, someone knew wat I was talkig about, reminding me of the film's name (Unico) and so I have since been searchign desperately to try and reclaim this striking facet of my youth... If ANYONE can help me in aquiring a copy of this work, please, I would greatly appreciate your help... I am at a query on as to why these memories have remained with me over the years, and why they chose to surface now, but I now find it essential to re-view Unico and discover why..."
5,A must for any Genealogist or Family Historian,"What can you say about a book that has everything! This is the final book of a series of four and takes one from the inception of a research project through to final publishing. For a Genealogist or Family Historian it's a godsend. Sources of information are discussed that the average researcher wouldn't dream existed. Once picked up, very hard to put down. Excellent!"
5,Good phrase book to get by.,This is a handy pocket sized phrase book that is very handy to communicate the very basics. If you want to get in depth with the language this is not for you. If you want to learn a few basic phrases then this is for you. Many people spoke my native language in Scandinavia which made it easier to get by with the many interactions I dealt with but it was fun to make attempts at learning some of the languages. Have a go at it. Fun Stuff!
1,Not compatible with PSPgo,"I bought this as a suggested item from Amazon when I purchased a PSPgo as a Christmas gift for my partner. However, it doesn't work with the PSPgo device, so it was a waste of my money. Make sure you purchase a different home and travel charger if you need a second one for your PSPgo."
2,Questionable Product,"Recommend another charger. After I received it and using it a couple times, the battery no longer charges to full capacity. Maybe a coincidence but the battery was fine prior to using this charger."
1,Poor charger.,"I waited long for it and as soon as plugged, it sparked and never worked. It was a complete failure."
1,Only worked once,"Only charged my PSP once then it simply stopped working and all outlets in my house are fine, this product is useless and I DON'T recommend it to ANYONE."
3,Good,"This product is good but when i purchased it, it worked for only 2-3 months and then it stoped working suddenly"
2,After a month it stopped working,"After recieving my psp on christmas of 2008 I would mostly play it for as long it as I could , this charger is pretty long which was useful for me of . After about a month of charging my psp it just stopped working, I have been though many psp charges that shared the same fate so future psp owners be prepare to good though a huge amount of chargers"
1,I cannot believe this.,"I've had an original PSP-1000 since it came out a few years back. I never really needed to move into a new model because of the reliability.Over the course of the past month, I lost my home charger in a recent move, so I decided that $12 was okay to spend on a new one.I attached the new charger into the wall and plugged the PSP in, and the little light came on signaling the charge. I walked away to go get some things done.I check on the PSP an hour later and the light was off. Odd, it usually glows green.I unplugged the PSP and tried to turn it on. Nothing. This new charger completely fried my PSP. Buyers beware, this thing destroyed the battery AND the insides.Alas, I went out and bought a PSP-3000. Just be careful with this. I've seen nothing but great reviews, and yet I lost a great device."
1,Don't Purchase!!!!!,"Two three weeks after placing order to arrive. After viewing the package it's no wonder as to why.......it was shipped from China. We thought maybe there was an internal problem with the PSP itself and since its still under warranty shipped it back and received a brand new one. It was only then that we discovered that it was not the PSP, but the chargers. This charger did not work upon receipt. Very disappointed! Wish I had payed more attention to the reviews before purchasing, would not have ordered if I had."
1,Doesn't Work,The charger worked once. Then never again. Also it's misleadingly labeled. It's not a travel charger (car) it's just a regular ac adapter.
1,Don't waste your time,I plugged this charger in and after about 5 minutes it popped several times then smelled like electrical fire and quit working. After reading similar comments from several others it appears that mine is not the only one.
1,Doesn't work,"Removed the adapter from packaging, plugged it in, plugged it into the PSP and... it doesn't work. I recommend avoiding this product and this manufacturer. Serves me right for cheaping out and not buying the official Sony adapter (which I'm going to do now)."
1,Bad,Did not work at all. Shake it and hear a rattle. DO NOT BUY. I went to a local store and bought one it worked fine.
1,Faulty Charger,"For starters, this item was listed as a ""Home and Travel Charger"", this in fact is not the case. This charger does not come with a 12 volt wire system for the vehical, only a 110 volt for the home. Second, the most important item, is that the charger does NOT work. Once the charger is plugged into my PSP, the unit will work but the charger has killed my battery. The battery now, will NOT hold a charge and will the PSP will NOT work, unless it's plugged directly into the wall. What a waste of time and money for this poor device. I do NOT recommend this product at all to anyone, save your money and buy from a reliable place that will back what they sale. Now I have to buy another charger and a new battery. Thanks for costing me more money!"
1,Did not charge,This product did not work on my son's PSP. I am not sure why. I bought two of them and neither would charge either PSP.
4,this is one chingon c.d.,"This c.d. has to be one of the best c.d.s I have ever heard,it has songs for every kind of mood your in from wwhen you feel like chingando somebody to just kickin' back and relaxin'.Smokers groove is one of the best rolas I have heard in sometime,most of the songs in the c.d. are firme."
4,Love It,"I got this for Christmas '07 and have been using it daily for coffee and tea and love it! Twice the ""light"" didn't come on, but the water still boiled fine and the ""light"" is now working fine. I would recommend this product."
2,Overpriced and flawed,"I was very pelased with the way this french press worked the first few times. After about a week, whenever the coffee and water reached the top of the carafe to automatically shut off, coffee grounds and water would come spurting out of the pour spout. This created a huge mess and then to top it all off, the base leaked and created a short somewhere in the electrical. Everytime I plug it in, it throws a breaker on my eletrical outlet. I think they have a good concept here, just needs some better engineering."
1,two broken in one year; no response from manufacturer,"This is a great idea! Unfortunately, we have had two of these die on us in about one year. Bought the first one, loved it, then saw it start leaking all over the base; soon it stopped working. Wrote the company, sent photos showing the leak, no response. A houseguest bought us a new one (before we could tell him to save his money). New one seemed to work fine, then it died the same leaky death after about 4-5 months. We kept the carafe, which works fine on its own if you pour boiled water into it.Now we're in the market for a new French Press and we are getting a good old fashioned manual one."
1,Horrible!,"Within one week of using this product, the base of the carafe came apart. The worst product I've ever bought!"
1,A disaster,"On day two, the unit leaked all the contents (including coffee grounds) all over the counter.This is consistent with what several other reviewers have reported.I would strongly suggest that one not purchase this item. There must be some serious flaw in the manufacturing or design process."
5,Excellent Electric French Press,I bought this french press a year ago and it's had nearly daily use since and is going strong.To all the people complaining about it leaking all over: boil the water first then add the coffee.
4,chef's choice electric french press,"Love it and use it daily. Not only does it get the water the right temperature for coffee, but we also use it to boil water for tea. I had to adjust to making smaller quantities since the coffee starts to lose temperature (as expected). Very good product."
2,poorly made,The idea of an electric French press is a great idea. however it should sit straight and level in the electric base. Our's sits at 10* angle and scares my wife and that it might fall over when it reaches full boil which is pretty intense.
1,thanks for the reviews,"I got excited about this product as I need a good coffee maker at my desk at work. I found the makers web site and read all about the product after reading an ad in the ""New Yorker'. Thank goodness for the review section. I am going to continue my search as the last thing that I need on my work space is a leaking coffee pot.Thanks, Allen"
2,"great product, too bad it leaks","like another reviewer here, i had my unit about a year before a leak developed between the black plastic housing and the glass carafe, near the base.i used mine once-a-day like clockwork. it boils water tremendously fast so it works great for tea as well. but, now water will slowly drip out of the leak even when it's cold and not being used.it's unfortunate because if you use filtered water, this is the purest way to make coffee. and i can't see fit to buy a replacement if it's going to cost me $... a year..."
2,"Other Reviews Correct: Great Concept, Bad Design","I live on a boat - everything I own needs to have at least two functions, so I thought this electric french press would easily cover my need for boiling water and a fresh cup of coffee. Unfortuantely, my experience has followed the other reviewers'. Yesterday, after just over one month of use, the carafe started leaking. I am very disappointed and will not be replacing the unit. Its back to the old stove top kettle for now..."
1,Another leak story,"I bought two of these for Christmas gifts (one for myself too). The idea of being able to heat water so fast and in the pot you are going to make coffee in is wonderful - BUT - like most of the other reviews posted here, leaks started within 6 months of use. Too bad this seems to be a common problem. I am getting ready to send mine back to the company for a ""fix"" - wonder how long that will last? I wouldn't buy another unless they fixed the design flaw."
3,Leaky Great Idea,This is the second one we've had. The electrical element in the pot burned out in the first one. Now the second one leaks after four months of use. I concur that it's a great idea but a faulty design. I hope someone gets it right eventually because my husband loves it.
3,"Great tea, poor quality control.","I enjoy great tea and the perfect brew. I've used similar items previously with good results. This electric french press brews the perfect cup of tea. However, I was dismayed to see that after two uses, it started to leak. Upon further inspection, I noticed that the food grade silicon seal around the base of the glass portion of the carafe was irregularly placed. Easily visible by what should be quality control. The leakage is intermittent, so not a total waste. I would recommend, but beware the iffy quality."
2,They leak!,"When these came out a few years ago I bought one right away. Unfortunately it leaked around the base quite significantly. A few months later I bought another one, hoping it would be better. It leaked even worse.This one may be a new and improved model but I'm afraid to buy it -- I've already wasted $180 on two that didn't work well."
4,DOES THE JOB WELL,"This strap does what it's suppose to do. I spent $40 on a rockin' leather strap that slips off, won't slide around on my shoulder when I need to move, and feels rough on the skin. The ERNIE BALL STRAP slides against my clothing and keeps it ez to move around onstage."
3,"It works, it's cheap","It's a polypro strap. It holds the guitar.It is also extremely uncomfortable with a heavier guitar. My Telecaster is a pretty heavy guitar and this strap slides and cuts into my neck.Of course a $30-$40 leather strap is ideal, but the price for this strap got me by until I could get the other."
4,Straps,"I'm sure glad that I bought these straps, there not leather but are put together very well. I plan on using them as backups in the studio. The price was just right, cam quickly and I'd buy them again."
5,Great strap!,"Great buy, always use this strap, last forever! Wearing right now :) Great for guitar or bass! Nice, long and comfortable. Gotta love that Ernie ball"
5,Exactly what I ordered,"No complaints at all about this strap. Its nylon construction, so its not soft and cushy, but its exactly what I ordered and paid for. Used it for about 2 weeks now and no probs."
5,straps,"im a taller guy and I love the fact that these straps are longer, and they fit well with straplocks"
3,"Very mediocre strap, but I've seen much worse","The strap is cheap, and pretty much, you get exactly what you pay for. Not a terrible strap that you could find from some crap brand in the 2$ price range, but a mediocre strap that simply does not compare to high quality leather ones either. The strap is 2"" wide-which is right in the middle somewhere, and is some polyester sewn material. It's not leather, but it's not terrible either. They don't look that bad, but THEY WILL START TO SLIP with more extensive use. Mine rendered useless after about 6 months, and I doubt you could expect much more than that."
3,Earinie Ball black guitar strap,"The strap was purchased for my son who lives in another state. He received in the time span specified. There are no problems with the strap at this point. He has only had it for a month, therefore all I can say is things went as expected with no problems.Carolyn"
2,how did this thing attach to the guitar?,"Both of the end are holes, how you guys put this on the guitar? anyone have a picture or video to show me? Thanks.My guitar have only a knob at the end of the body"
2,"if you flick the 'balance' knob, an interesting interview","Wow! A new Throbbing Gristle release! Hardly. This is a great example of what I've always felt about TG. Weird and scary, but also a bit of a prank. This disc - not old, clearly a recent side-scrape of the Throbbing Gristle (media/aural) barrel - is only for TG fanatics. I am one of that lot, so I'll give up the punchline. This CD contains interviews with Genesis P'Orridge, Japanese/Russian & 'cut-up'/'found sound'/ambient noise. The trickery lies with the mixing, like the Velvet Underground's ""Gift"".SPOILER: if you want to hear the intersting thoughts of Genesis, shift your stereo Balance knob to hard left. If you want to hear Throbbing Gristle demos, switch your Balance knob to hard right. Either way, it's a pain. Throbbing Gristle in a nutshell. There's no music of worth here, and you'd be mad to make this one of your first TG purchases."
3,Throbbing Gristle - 'Grief' (Yeeah!/Almafame),"'Grief' was originally put out as a bootleg,but BEFORE the label Thirsty Ear put it out as a legit release,the UK label Yeeah!/Almafame had released it on theirs.'Grief' is a rather strange CD to have a copy of.If you're a new/er Gristle fan,you might want to check out a few of their main lp's/reissues FIRST.Then,if you like what you hear,go ahead and get 'Grief'.Two cuts here of lengthy(how would one put it?)indepth sound collages.I liked ""Camera""(24:29)a bit better than I did ""Telephone""(23:03).But,then again,Throbbing Gristle has always been considered to be,like mutated industrial.Their line-up(sometimes I have a tough time remembering)is:Genesis P-Orridge-bass&clarinet,Chris Carter-keyboards&synthesizer,Peter Christopherson-sound effects and Casey Fanni Tutti-guitar&vocals.Their influences come from Faust,Can and Silver Apples.Could appeal to fans of Clock DVA,Front Line Assembly and Controlled Bleeding.Pretty much aimed toward completists."
1,avoid this CD!,"Rubbish - sounds like a tape put together by a TG fan in about 1985 or thereabouts. Basically, this is some interviews with G P-O and radio programmes in a variety of languages mixed with some TG live pieces and put into split stereo. That makes it sound vaguely interesting, but it's not. Not one for TG obsessives, or anyone really.A real rip-off to reissue this on CD, esp as there are a load of great TG concert tapes around that have yet to make the transfer to CD (ok, i know they're on the boxset, but who the [...] has the time or money for that?).I took this back to the shop and exchanged it immediately, and i have a high tolerance for TG bilge."
2,Runs Waaaaay Small! Poor Quality!,"I am a size 4-6 and am 5'2"" and the small, which is supposed to fit sizes 6-9 is very small! The legs are even too short and I'm a short person! Also poorly made. Mine had two holes under the arrm at the seam and the belt was coming unsewn. It's a cute costume but too many problems."
4,Brings Aristotle to Life,"The 'Master of Him That Knows' is again brought to life. The only criticism of the book is that in the later chapters the author conflates some of his ideas with those of Aristotle. However, overall Randall does a great job bringing Aristotle's thought into cogent focus and showing how it is still relevant. Well written, insightful, and easy to read."
4,the end of the series,The last book had a different ending to what I expected. Isabeau had finally accepted her hand and what had happened. She is falling for the black eyed jougleur very fast. Iseult is hurt and confused by Lachlan and vice versa. She wants to stay on the Spine of the World but knows that it isnt what her heart truly wants. With help from Iseult's and Isabeau's father's people and all the laird's the humans attack the Fairgain. The war is long and devestating but in the end Isabeau uses her power to stop the Priestess of Jor and save Fand. The humans and sea-faires make a treaty and for once all is in peace.
1,An embroidery book with NO color photos?,"First of all, this is a reprint of a 1985 book, which should be clearly stated in its description. Secondly, have you ever seen an embroidery book without a single color photo? And with hardly any explanation of stitches? The entire book consists of black-and-white photos of different embroidery stitches in use in finished works. The book has scant text, most of it descriptions such as ""Blocks of detached buttonhole worked in thick, thin, shiny and matt threads,"" which might be helpful if the photos were in color and you could see the difference. The book also has such ""useful"" suggestions as ""Try working the stitch very tightly or in a loose manner.""Jan Beaney is a master but this 20-year-old book is an anachronistic dinosaur compared to the newer books available, including Jan Beaney's own Stitch Magic and her series of booklets published by Gemini Press.I'm going to return this book, as I find it of no use at all."
4,An interesting design book,"Stitches: New Approaches is a reprint of a book published in 1985. It is not intended to be a comprehensive stitch dictionary, but rather, a guide to what can be done with a stitch and some imagination. Each stitch has a large number of photographs, all in black and white. I would have loved to have seen the original works in color, but the black and white images focus on the stitch as well as the texture.There is also advice on developing a design, starting from sketching. This is intended as a design text, so there are no patterns included. The goal of this book seems to be to provide a solid base on which to develop a stitched design."
3,older reprint,"I have to agree with the other reviewers, I would have liked to have known most of the the photos in the book are black and white, and was a reprint from the 80's. They do insert some color photos, and that only makes you want to see the whole thing in color! Jan Beaney, and her partner, Jean Littlejohn are real masters of this media..I'd recommend their newer endeavors, the booklets they have been producing with Double Trouble Enterprises are invaluable. I'm not sure if I'm keeping this one, but definately seek out their newer work."
2,Stitching,I was disappointed in this book. There was very little hands ontechnique for each stitch. Which left me with very little enthusiasim tofigure out on my own how to execute the stitches.
5,One of the greatest Mozart recordings ever!,"Every disc I have heard in the Mozart Symphony series from Sir Charles Mackerras' fruitful collaboration with the Prague Orchestra are simply amazing, and this one is no exception. Mackerras' research into 18th century performance practices is fascinating and when I listen to these fresh and masterful renditions, it's as if I'm hearing them for the very first time. The final movement of No. 35 is thrilling, and overall the tempos on this disc are perfect. The symphonies on this cd span the development of Mozart's musical genius between 1779 (when no. 32 was composed in Salzburg) and 1788, when he wrote the 39th, one of the final three symphonies that are still regarded as three of the greatest achievements in music history. In summary, this is a brilliant recording by one of the very best Mozart interpreters in the world. Don't hesitate---buy it today!"
4,Great performances -- too bad they were recorded by Telarc!,"Charles Mackerras has done some remarkable work, and this disc is no exception. Thrilling fast-paced original-instrument-style playing. What a terrible shame that he has done so much of his recording with Telarc. All of they're recordings sound horribly muffled, with no clarity at all. It sounds like you're listening to the concert from outside the concert hall. When the beauty of Mackerras' conducting IS great clarity and brilliance, this is a crime. Oh, Mr. Mackerras, if you're reading this, find another recording company!"
4,Comfortable toe socks,"I have to have socks with a mostly cotton content, so these were perfect for me. I recently bought some vibram five fingers and wanted socks for them, but I find that I wear them all the time. These have an arch band that hugs your foot.I will definitely be buying more!Pros* COTTON!I have sweaty feet (sorry I know, gross!), and they wick moisture like a dream!* I have normal shaped feet and they fit me very well* Variety of very nice colorsCons* Not for extended wearI would not wear these if you have a lot of walking to do as they will probably move and cut into you somewhere.* Because they wick, you cannot wear them everyday if you have dry feet.* May not fit imperfect feetThis is a downside to all toesocks"
5,3 great CDs reissued as box set,"Great stuff, great price; I didn't realize until it arrived that it is a repackaging of 3 CDs already issued by Green Linnet (which I already owned as single discs). Still, now I can give those away to friends and turn them on to these great songs."
5,you cant improve on this one,"I had this years ago for my nokia. but when i switched phones, i had to toss it. but then i couldnt find this anymore for the 2.5mm. I am glad that its back. i bought it for the price. Im buying it again b/c it is the best thing ever made for cell phones. I might have to buy two in case they stop making it again."
2,"It didn't sound very good, and it didn't fit","The Jabra EarSet sounds like a fabulous idea - the whole assembly right in your earpiece, no microphone on a stick, no microphone on a string. Unfortunately, if your ears aren't fairly close to the size of the ear gels, the earpiece either falls out of your ear or causes it substantial pain. To make matters worse, the EarSet really cuts the high frequencies, making the people you're talking to sound like they are speaking through a wet bath towel. But that's okay, since as far as they're concerned you're talking to them through a paper towel tube.I purchased my EarSet about two years ago, so the product you buy here may be better."
2,He can do better than this,This album was released after Romance. How could he go back to these mediocre temas after Romance? It's just a waste of the great talent.
3,Not His Best but still pretty Good,"The First 4 songs of the Album are the best ones after that it really goes down hill. I know to some people ""Hasta Que Me Olvides"" is the strongest Ballad in this one but I disagree. To me the strongest Ballad is ""Me Niego a estar solo"" and even ""Hasta El Fin"" is better. If it wasn't for the first four songs of the album I would have not bought the album. I honestly tried listening to the other songs but wasn't appealing. If you want an excellent Luis Miguel album buy 20 Años this one is truly an amazing CD."
4,Great for the price.....,I bought these speakers to use on our deck and also to point out at our pool. I am amazed at the sound quality for such a small box. If you are looking for an inexpensive set of speakers to place outdoors then these are a perfect fit. I am going to order a second pair in order to increase my coverage area.
3,"Not bad for the price, but not satisfying in the long haul.","I used a pair of these speakers to set up what I called a ""bubba vision"" cheap home theater in my family room with an old Sansui receiver, an inexpensive DVD player, and a JVC 27"" TV.These worked very well, and were a considerable improvement over the speakers in the TV. However, it wasn't soon before I felt rather dissatisfied with them. Not unhappy, but just aware that I was listening to a very well built but ultimately cheap set of speakers, so I resold them.However, I also own a pair of the AudioSource LS200 speakers. They cost even less than these speakers, and to me have a bigger and warmer sound. I'm still using those and plan to be for quite some time."
2,Don't bother,These speakers sounded great but I do like to crank up the occasional KISS or VanHalen and these speakers just stopped working. I've never blown a speaker before but I guess that's what happened.
3,Okay for the price.,"These were a good price for small speakers I just wanted to sit on a shelf. Not fantastic sound, but gives adequate sound in a small room and they don't take up a lot of space."
3,"It's good, but I have seen better","This DVD was good, but compared to other Cirque shows like Quidam and Dralion it seems a bit rough. The DVD was very dark at times making the artists hard to see and the single spotlight in the back was distracting. If you are a Cirque collecter than this is for you, if you are a novice Cirque fan I recommend one of their later shows like Quidam or Dralion."
4,Very good Cirque,"This DVD has more acts to it than the Bravo TV special, and it's worth the purchase. Although some of the acts doesn't ""wow"" me like newer shows, they are better than ""Cirque Reinvente"", and the music is very nice. My favorite part is the ""Film Scene"" where one of the clowns acts out an old time movie with three audience members. Two complaints about the disc is that the video is dark at times, and the only extras are trailers for other Cirque DVDs. I wish there was a behind-the-scenes look, but there isn't."
3,"Quiet, good price - not very durable","Very quiet, high quality motor. I put this one in our apartment complex's workout room. It worked quite well, with kudos to the sturdy round base and wide adjustment range on the head (you can tilt it straight up).However, after three weeks the retaining ring for the grill vibrated loose, which resulted in significant (though repairable) damage. We had a similar model in our office last summer. Ran it 60+ hours a week for months, no problem. The first time it tipped over, onto a hardwood floor, a blade broke and that was it.Overall this fan is good for the price, but if your usage and/or handling is heavy, then consider spending more for a more durable brand."
3,Not as quiet as claims here.,"i dont know what all these people are on reviewing this fan here, but this fan is not ""uber quiet"", ""wisper quiet"", or however there calling it. its ""average quiet"". it no quiieter than fans ive purchaced over the years at stores like k-mart, job lot, etc, that cost half the price. its not loud, but the lowest speed isnt quiet as claims. i use this in a bedroom, and at night, its annoying when trying to hear a tv. i have to bump up the volume when i want it low before falling asleep. i just wish the lowest speed was a little slower; then it would be quiet enough.heres a tip about fans:Metal blades = quieter.keep the fron grill off the fan; it will be somewhat quieter, and also be abot 1/4th more powerful.been doing it for years. try it, if you dont have kids that will put there hands on the moving blades."
3,Good air flow but definitely not quiet,"I bought one at the big yellow big box retailer and assembled it rather quickly.The reviewers are correct that this fan has a plastic front grill, plastic blades but a metal back grill with a metal stand.Pros:Moves a large amount of air and is pretty powerfulEasy to assembleCons:The tilting mechanism looks very flimsy and I am sure this will be one of the first things to give outIt is loud. I would argue this is much noisier than any review has led you to believe. On High this thing sounds like a mini propeller plane and even on low it has quite the discernible sound.It is a decent value in the $30 price range IMHO and I will update this review as this thing ages."
5,"I love this joyful, playful, delightful book!","I received Coloring Your Prayers as a gift from a friend this past summer. It is a joyful, playful, inspirational romp of empowerment and fun. I find it a unique contribution and magical exploration for our ""colorful selves."" I have bought a number of copies for friends and family. My grandchildren (ages 11 and 14) are equally enthusiastic about Carolyn's book and we have enjoyed many hours coloring together. It's great family fun in the car too. It's a keeper! Thank you, Carolyn!!"
4,Extra Flare with no added size or weight,I bought 6 of these guys. One showed up dead (not able to hold a charge) but ... replaced it no questions asked. The others work beautifully. They are great conversation peices and charge life is comparable to OEM stuff from Motorola. The colors that flash are green and red and rotate in a circular pattern on the battery during talk mode and when going from bad to good coverage and vice versa. Good stuff.
1,WARNING!!!!!!!!! Do not buy this book,"I have to say, this is one of the worst items I have ever purchased in my life, Its so bad I threw it in the bin because I felt like I was duped by the author who I think is a con artist. So please, do not buy this tripe, its not worth the paper its written on, you have been warned."
1,Dreadful!!!,"Poor sound quality that bounced from left to right speakers, grainy video image, haunted-house music soundtrack, I fully expected a black cat to jump out at me! The dvd I received was scratched and was apparently either used or poorly handled. Save your money and buy a good book, or, as I have done, purchase a quality dvd from Steve Murray. Dreadful!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,This brace hurts,"The old brace was a pull-on one piece item. It was hard to get off when sweaty, but it was comfortable.The new brace puts too much bulk (2 layers) under your arch and is uncomfortable to wear for more than an hour or so. Did this company do market research? I don't think so."
5,HOW MANY WAYS CAN I SAY GET THIS CD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I already have this cd and I have to say the fisrt 5 sample selections on this site barely give an inkling as to how tight this group really is. My personal favorites are ""Where's my daddy at"", ""Liquidation"", ""Tools of Destruction"", ""To the Rescue"", ""Too Easy"", and the list goes on."
5,Most wonderful CD!,My family loves this CD! The traditional melodies are such a pleasure for us to listen to. My fourteen month old daughter also seems to adore it. I highly recommend this collection for anyone looking for Jewish music the whole family will enjoy.
3,blower motor,looked fine fit fine worked even better. came early the only way it could have been better if some one else paid for it and installed it.
4,David Cartwright,"This book is an excellent overview of the New Testament. Especially well treated is the background leading up to 1st century Judea in culture, geography, and political standings. Done in easy to understand language.Some terms need clarification and refinement, but that would make the book over 1000 pages..."
5,Love this little pizzelle maker,"I love this little pizelle maker. Each fill makes 3 (3 1/2"") pizelles. While in Florida, I was able to make christmas gift pizelles for my friends in my RV without turning on the oven! Love the non stick coating, unlike my old pizelle maker which made 5"" cookies which I had to grease each fill - they always stuck! No problem now!"
4,Pizzelle maker,"The only unsatisfactory thing I found about the baker is the controls don't work properly. The ready light would come on as soon as the cover was locked down, so it was kind of hit and miss to make the cookies. At first some came out too brown and others were not brown enough. Once I got the timing right, I ended up with delicious cookies."
2,Disappointing,"Don't know how this cheaply made item gets all the good reviews ??I must have purchased a ""lemon"". From the first time I used it,the lid has always been loose, with no access to screws to tighten it. This requires pushing down on lid (with a pot holder)to get the back pizzelle to bake along with the front ones. I bought this 5 years ago and now the heating elements must be failing because it bakes very unevenly, with many sticking, even after re-seasoning the grids. I have been making pizzelles since I was a child, helping my grandma and mom make them on an old-fashioned, hand held stove-top iron. I've had two other electric ones over the years, one with cast iron grids and one aluminum, and they are still usable, but cook slowly. I had hoped to purchase a newer, faster model, but this one is just a big disappointment. I will probably buy yet another one, but it will not be a Chef's Choice brand. Don't buy it !!"
4,"Simple, Quick and Delicious","First, I should mention that I own anotherPizzelle Bake appliance,also,it's a 5""sizeso although it is similar, it only makes 2pizzelles at a time. I enjoy this one verymuch, no aerosol to spray oil/butter, no messand simple to clean. Our friends enjoy thepizzelles dipped in chocolate and on the topof vanilla ice cream.. By the way, the appliancewas delivered quickly. Try it, you and your familywill love home made cookies on the cheap."
5,Chef's Choice 835 Pizzelle Pro Express Bake,I really like this Pizzelle maker. My 12 year old daughter and I had such fun making the pizzelles. The recipe was so easy. They were so easy to make. It took a few tries to get just the right amount of batter but WOW!! They are wonderful! If you are looking for an easy pizzelle maker this is it!
1,Poor product,"Do not buy this product... The first two times I used this iron everything went well... The last two times I could not get the pizzells from sticking to the top plate, no porblem with the bottom plate... Now the top plate is ruined... I have never had this problem with my other pizzelle irons..."
3,Oh No Not Again !!!!!!,"I was very exicted to get my pizzelle maker. I used it as per instructions. Never used anything but a plastic spoon in it...and never found the need for a oil spray. However on my second use I noticed the teflon was coming off on the very back disc...beyond the outline for the cookie. Was confused why it would be coming off there?? My cookie batch came out with teflon on it even!! I was so disappointed!!!! WASTED my money on a worthless product!!! The machine works perfectly , however none of us want to be eating teflon on our cookies. As much as I love this product I can't justify my family eating teflon!!!!!!! I have a picture of the teflon balding , and hope the company wishes to see it. DISAPPOINTED!!!!"
5,MUST HAVE !!!,"I thought I couldn't live without my Cuisinart or Kitchen Aide - this product goes on the same list!!! This was the easiest, best performing kitchen ""gizmo"" I have ever had. A must for entertaining and holiday baking - simple, easy - no mess! Gone are the days with the ""one at a time"" with the gas burner!! Love it, love it!!!"
5,Chef's Choice 835 Pizelle Pro Grill,"This pizelle maker is quite easy to use. It regains heat quickly, so there is very little time needed between making each ""batch"" of cookies. This pizelle grill makes three pizelles at a time, which is a nice feature. The pizelles come off of the grill easily, which is a concern that I had when originally deciding which brand to purchase. The recipe to make the pizelles is also quite simple. I made the first pizelles with my Mom, who is in a wheelchair. The following week, she called me to tell me that she had made them herself. She was very happy about that! The Chef's Choice pizelle maker is also easy to clean, after use. Another good feature - the pizelle grill stores in an upright position, so that it takes less cabinet space.I originally selected this brand because I also own a Chef's Choice Electric teakettle, which is well made and heats water very quickly.FH, Marietta, Georgia"
5,Chef's choice 835 Pizzelle Pro Express Bake,It is just what the person wanted for a present.Easy to clean and fast cooking.It is compact and doen't take up the whole counter.
4,love my pizzelle,"After running around all over town looking for a reasonably priced pizzelle maker with no luck- I went to amazon and found the Chefs Choice Pizzelle Pro Express Bake! Once it arrived we immediately set up the kitchen and made it a family event. We truly enjoyed making over a hundred cookies. We followed the recipe in the book provided, used the measuring spoon included, dusted with powdered sugar and enjoyed! Perfect size for snacks. We made a second batch to package up for Christmas gift baskets. Easy to operated and quick clean up make this a super product! Our only concern was getting the baking time just right."
3,Pizzelle Iron,"It's okayI had to get used to it the next time I would buy one with just 2 pizzelles this one has 3 ,but it's just okay ."
1,"excelente, pero..............","Muy buen disco. Complemento del 1o., con una buena selecciòn de canciones. Salvo un par de piezas que francamente se escuchan muy pobres musicalmente, con una estructura simplona y repetitiva, todo lo demas es lo que distingue al grupo.Algo que encuentro muy deficiente es la grabaciòn: los ingenieros de sonido o estan sordos o simplemente no saben nada de sonido: la distorciòn en todas y cada una de las pistas es tremenda, no se puede escuchar a un volumen medio porque inmediatamente se escucha sucio.Làstima del porducto, todas sus virtudes desmerecen con esta deficiencia.A pesar de esto serìa maravilloso que amazòn se pusiera las pilas y empezara a distribuir todas las grabaciones no solo de este grupo, sino tambièn a Atomsko Skloniste, Leb i sol, Smak, Teska Industrija, Tako, Bajaga, Azra, Zeljico Bebek, Riblija Corba, etc, ya que de este lado del atlàntico es casi imposibe conseguir algo de ellos."
2,If you own an older version why not pay extra for a video?,"This video is way too costly, and I see it was even brought down in price by the Amazon Gurus. You know something is wrong when 2 training videos will run you $100. Especially considering Boris itself offers a video on their site for 1/5 the price of this one and it is for the newest versions. These tapes do have some good techniques and general infomartion on the product. But there was more in here praising the FX program rather than running through amazing tips you can use. At $50 a video this training course should show you how to create ILM effects while juggling flaming knives eating a whole pie with no hands all while whistling Dixie."
5,2 classics and neat bonus film,"This disc is quite a bargain with not one but three movies on it. Will Rogers as ""Judge Priest"" is a real charmer about a long-gone slow paced south. The second feature is a landmark silent film. ""Tumbleweeds"" is arguably William S. Hart's finest performance. The film has a poignant spoken preface with Hart himself saying good-bye to the old west. The musical soundtrack was specially produced for this 1939 re-release of the 1925 film. The third feature(titled ""Yellowstone""), while strictly a ""B"" movie, is fun to watch because of the beautiful exteriors actually shot at Yellowstone National Park. Though out-of-print, this disc is worth seeking out."
4,Baglady,"Adorable in person! You'll love it. I get compliments from women everywhere when I carry this bag. Plus, it's STURDY. Nor cheap flimsy wicker"
3,out of date but still readable,"Came across this book in library. Pretty old, but the style is pleasing and it's less than 300 quite readable pages with exercises!If it's an up-to-date version, it could fetch at least 4 star. Sorry, so many people got burnt by bubbles."
2,Bland and Questionable,"I found alot in this book to be questionable. I am not sure how the author could have rembered as much and in detail as she claims. And the other parts were just plain bland. Her life really seems to be no different than any other childs, we all come from unique families, but at most times have the same struggles and thoughts. Unfortunately, this book was not that enlightening."
1,not good at all,"I am going to break my ,""no book reviews"" rule, and review this one. I usually don't review books because whether or not you like a book usually depends on personality, and what you were expecting. But this book was awful. I made myself read it, but found that it read like one giant run-on sentence. She kept going in circles ( o.k. I get it you were lonely and misunderstood, welcome to adolescence).The hippie stuff was also very boring. It consisted of a very very short time in a commune ( six months I think), and some time living out of a mail truck. The rest was a relatively normal broken-home experience.To be fair this woman can definately weave words, and knowing that she is a poet, I think she should have stuck with that. Her poetry is probably amazing. Unfortunately,this book was undisciplined,self-absorbed, and like listening to someone ramble on and on saying whatever is in their head. I really hate that I bought this, I wish I would have checked it out from the library."
2,Split,"The reader should follow the advice of the title and split, leaving this book behind. Lisa Michaels had one moment of glory, being photographed holding a Vietcong flag and that photo being published in Life. Beyond that there is not much about her childhood which is interesting or exceptional enough to be worth plowing through 300 pages of detail. Unfortunately the editors of ""Split"" failed to cut this longwinded account down to something which could do justice to the pieces of Lisa's life really worth noting. One can learn most of what is interesting about Lisa's story in the dozen pages allotted her in Chelsea Cain's ""Wild Child."""
3,...and the point is?,"I think Lisa Michaels tells a good story...but I found that her book stretched credibility just a little. Specifically all the political discussions with her parents--I, too, was a child of hippies, and I remember them doing their own thing and not spending a lot of time explaining it to their children. But my main gripe is, what do we learn from Michaels' life? Her conclusion (as she states on the last page) is that, ""I can tell stories."" Well, yes. I guess I just wanted a little more."
2,Nice Looking Not durable bad reception,"The radio cooler looked greatbut I can't imagine it lasting very long for anindividual in the construction industry. My toddler opened the lid a few times and the seal on the cooler came off and it could not be put back on so the cooler would not work effectively after this. The radio works but the reception is not very good. I can't complain much because the item was free,I certainly would not pay for it."
5,ambient night music,For anyone who enjoys Chopin's Nocturnes--especially quieter pieces like his Op. 9 No. 1--John Field's earlier and original nocturnes will not disappoint. Excellent sound quality and performance. Truly a desert island selection.
5,Beautiful music,I first heard John Field's Nocturne in E minor played by Natasha Richardson's character in The White Countess. I loved the music and found that John Field is considered the father of the Nocturne. This cd is an excellent collection.
5,The entire series is a masterpiece!,"The Warriors series is the best ever! Erin Hunter really gives you a cat's perspective without making it cutesy. For example, many cats die in the books and many of the prophecies are dark like this one: Before there is peace, blood will spill blood and the river will run red. I would recommend this to you, for if you haven't started reading them, start NOW! But make sure to read them in order. It may be quite confusing if you don't, since there are so many stories and so many characters (a little like the lord of the rings trilogy).My point is, BUY THE SERIES and if you don't, you're missing out BIG TIME."
5,This book rocks!!,Erin Hunter has done it once more! WARRIORS The New Prophecy Dawn is a wonderful addition to the series. The traveling cats finally return and Bramblecalw and Squirrelpaw are getting closer and so are Crowpaw and Feathertail. Yet a terrible death falls among the traveling cats and brings one into sorrow. While Stormfur finds a love with another cat who believes in a different afterlife than that of StarClan. The forest starts to become an unsafe place to be and the clan cats are starting to feel the pressure. Excellent book highly recommened to reader of any age!
3,not the best of the new prophecy,"I thought Midnight and Moonrise were much better than Dawn. The whole point of the book was for the clans to leave the forest but for the firt 200+ pages they were just sitting around watching the forest get destroyed.In Midnight the whole book was about traveling, but in Dawn the clans make a longer journey in a smaller amount of pages.Once the clans left the forest the book got better."
5,From a Dark Age comes a New Beginning.,"This is the best book so far in the series!!! I cannot wait to read Starlight.Summery: Cats are beginning to disappear from all the clans. The chosen cats return from their journey to forfill the new prophecy. The four( except Feathertail) chosen cats (and Squirrelpaw) return to their clans and relay the message to their clan leaders. Together, all four of the clans team up together as one, and begin their journey to find a new forest for all the clans to rule together. From a dark age comes a new beginning."
5,WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I really enjoyed this book because of the action and adventure of their journey to find a new home. I also. Enjoyed how the setting changed from their home to the mountains, and to their new home around a peaceful lake as their journey continued. One of my favorite parts was when FeatherTail decided to stay with the tribe in the mountains and leave her clan for the love of her life. I would say the best part was the battle between the clans and the twolegs. Over all this is a great book, it's about 364 pages long and at a 5.5 book level and 12 points it is a great book to read FIVE STARS."
5,I love the Warriors books !!!!!!,"I have read all of the Warrior books, but Starlight and Twilight. I really need to read all of the other Warrior books because, their so great!!!!!! I really love the Warrior books so much I want all of the books to read!!!!! I really love the books Erin Hunter did I have to have them all!!!!!! I wish I had all the Warriors and Warriors the New Prophecy books to have in my books. I really, really, really love her books!!!!!!! Number 1 fan of the Warrior books Dakota."
5,Great book,Dawn was probably the darkest of all of the books. Theres so much action and stuff. Squirrelpaw has really mellowed out in this book so thats kool. It's an awesome book.
1,Not as listed car.,"The seller who didn;t reply to any emails until i bought the car. The listing said it was 3"" long well it is if you include the package card. The car is way smaller than the listing said it was. Don't buy this unless you want to use a microscope to see it.Way over priced and the shipping was way to much for what it is."
4,Worked for me! I now have the certificate.,"I am a technical writer and NOT a programmer, but wished to learn more about programming. Armed with nothing more than a cursory knowledge of the BASIC programming language, I jumped into this book with both feet. Three months later I was ready to take the included exam and qualify for the C programming certificate from University of Phoenix.I recommend this book to anyone who wants a self-paced guide to learning the C programming language. I especially recommend it to those wishing to move on to a language like C++."
3,It's alright!!!,"You have to speak loud in order for the person on the other end to hear you. that may be a bit inconvenient to use it at work. The earpiece fits really well and is very comfortable, and comes in 3 sizes: L, M, and S."
2,Not for Sprint Voice Command,"The Jabra Classic Earset for Samsung phones does not work well with Sprint's Voice Command option. When using the earset and attempting to use Voice Command, I have to shout in order to be heard in a quiet room. Even then some of the words are not picked up for Voice Command dialing. When I use the Jabra Earboom, Voice Command is able to pick up all of my words although their may be background noise and dial the correct number."
1,Don't buy this style earpiece,I used Jabra products for years. Their quality has slipped to low levels. No one could ever hear me when using this device-- the mic is too far away from your mouth. Go with a boom style earpiece.
4,This one's GREAT for Samsung OR Sanyo with 2.5 mm jack,"You JUST cannot find this one on the store shelves any more!I love the way this one locks in your ear...the lanyard clips to whatever and is QICK and easy setup. Sanyo owners...this one has a pushbotton in the middle of the lanyard and can access features such as answer, voice call, hold, and hang up. it's the ONLY earset that I know that accesses all those features in a Sanyo. I have the MM 7400 Multimedia and it works GREAT!"
5,People Hate Advanced Avrager,"I think Advanced Averager is a good beyblade. Other people don't like him though. He can Knock other beyblades out of the stadium if you lounge him good and hard enough. He's not as wild as Strata Dragoon, but not as calm as Sea Drake. I don't realy care if other people like him, but I care if I do."
1,The speed demon top,"Like the other person said, this top has a lot in common with strata dragoon ms, and that is why it is a speed demon. Unlike strata dragoon, this top has a metal and more durable tip. This makes sure that the tip isn't warped when it hits the beystadium. This top is very good and the only thing that should be customized is the weightdisk so this top has more endurance. GET THIS TOP!"
5,Cutting-edge compilation,"Edited by James H. Charles worth (Professor of New Testament Language and Literature and Director of the Dead Sea Scrolls Project at Princeton Theological Seminary), Jesus and Archaeology is an anthology of scholarly essays by learned authors, many of whom worked recently and directly in excavations at Bethsaida, Capernaum, Nazareth, and Jerusalem. Essay topics range from ""Did Jesus Attend the Synagogue?"" to ""Jesus and Resurrection Faith in Light of Jewish Texts"" to ""The Christian Apocrypha and Archaeology"" and much more. A handful of black-and-white photographs, a selected bibliography, an index of scripture and other ancient texts, and a glossary round out this cutting-edge compilation of what the latest archaeological findings tell us of Jesus and the era in which he lived."
5,The best recording of Enigma Variations,This recording published by Telarc is the best recording of the enigma variations I have ever heard. I just purchased four copies to give to friends and family as Christmas gifts.
2,no breeze and too noisy,"This is the only one product I felt regret to buy at Amazon until now. I expected to receive a good fan during the hot summer. However, I found except for the good looking, there existed some problems about leaf design and noise control. I think maybe wrong design of leaf of my fan made me feel almost no breeze. But the fan made so terrible noise. I feel so disappoint about that."
2,Quit after a month of occassional use,"The fan is pretty small for a floor fan, but it worked for my smallish NYC apartment. The look is great, but it was just a tad louder than I was expecting. But the kicker is that the fan just stopped working after about a month. And with only occassional use--maybe twice a week for a few hours at a time. I don't know, maybe I just got a defective product and all the rest are fine, but I'm pretty disappointed."
2,Fan-tastic? Not unless you are insane.,"There is something absurd about this fan. The picture of the fan does not provide a true sense of its scale -- if Gary Coleman walked into this fan hard enough he would severely scar his face. The instructions are inaccurate, but that's ok, anyone with a PHD in mechanical engineering and three hands should get the fan set up in a week or two. I would avoid this product, unless disappointment is what you are looking for in a fan."
3,Howard's Review,"If you have just one week to study, and plan to spend less than $30. This book with ETS Official Guide is what I recommend you to get. Cliff Notes gives a brief review, give you one diagnostic test. If you have $100 budget and months to study for the test, this book would like be as helpful as other books. However, If you only have one week and just want to have a brief prep, this is a must have."
5,This book deserves a better sales ranking position!,"Maybe it's not so fashionable as others like Kaplan, Princeton, Arco, etc. but this book is worth every dollar you invest on it. It has a thorough approach to GMAT subjects and it also has a lot of good questions -separeted by level of difficulty. It doesn't have a CD-Rom but that's why you should buy some more book(s) if you are intending to work even harder than Cliffs will make you work. If you want to buy just 2 books I would tell you to buy the Official Guide and this one - and it's enough to get the GMAT well done!"
2,Inexpensive but ...,"It is really worth spending [more] and getting decent speakers. Model18's highs are to high, base is distorted at modereate volume. If you care about sound at all look somewhere else."
2,Saw blade,"Price is good,but doesn't last long at all.Made several cuts on a sheet of 4x8 plywood and the blade was already dragging and causing some burn marks on the cut.I have a good 3 Hp saw so it's not the saw it was the blade."
1,Dont waste your time,"Have tried it on veneered plywood and plastic, tons of tear out, even if you use tape. Ill just stick with my 60 tooth carbide blade."
1,Waste of money,"Blade arrived dull as a butter knife, so dull it actually burnt the 3/8"" plywood I tried to cut with it ! Save your money, waste of money here."
1,Junk do not buy,"Complete junk I tried to give it 0 stars. Could not cut 3/4 9 ply birch, 3/4 7 ply maple or 3/4 7 ply oak. It whines as if it is bound in the saw but its not. There is no burning on either side of the cut. It just will not cut."
4,They also serve,"I've charged this thing up and it sits and waits to be used. I've experimented with the various functions which are easy enough to manipulate.I haven't had the need to use it and hope I never have to (and find it wanting).I have wondered if the air compressor is strong enough to inflate tires. It seems a bit anemic, but I haven't tried it on tires."
5,"Exquisite, unique choral works","Brahms is overwhelmingly the most-performed composer in the 45-year history of the American Choral Directors Association conventions, according to a very informative ACDA monograph by Sandefur Schmidt -- confirming what one might naturally suspect. This reflects not only the especially large contribution Brahms made to choral literature (both sacred and secular, large- and small-scale), but also a universal love for that romantic era of music which Brahms exemplified better than anyone, in absolutely first-rate compositions. Okay, maybe some people don't care for it. For the rest, you can't go wrong with these, the secular pieces for chorus & orchestra -- a sub-genre with almost no lasting competition from Brahms' contemporaries or followers. Uniquely gorgeous works, in excellent performances."
2,unbalanced,I found the balance between the orchestra and the voice parts was poor. The voices were comparatively lower in volume. A great disappointment.
2,Difficult to open...,"We have chickens, so we needed sturdy containers to keep up with the egg flow. Unfortunately this container can be difficult to open; it doesn't merely lift open. You must squeeze in certain areas and hope it works. This often results in cracked or broken eggs in the process. I am going to try the Coleman brand and hope for better results. These will go away with gift eggs."
4,Good Information,"I have been looking for information on how to keep my joints healthy, especially knees, since so many of my friend have been having problems. This book really provided some good information that I will be putting into practice."
5,This really does help!,I really think that the Yoga poses ( if you do them every day) really do help. She explains all of the poses in detail.
4,After Knee Replacement Surgery,I continue to do yoga after right knee replacement surgery. Does this book give you tips on how to protect your knee after surgery? Does it give suggestions on modifying poses?
1,CUTE,Love Karlie but the DVD was a waste of time. To much nothing and not enough of the creamy center. I didn't get this one because I need to excercise..so unless you do need to...stay away and jog.
4,Does What Is Advertised,"This is another product that goes where I go. I don't use it a lot but it has never failed to function as advertised. My only question on this item is, ""Why is it necessary?"" Nikon has this technology and should include it in every high end digital camera."
3,Nikon Remote Thoughts,"This works. However, it is klunky, large, and the path is easily impeded. Furthermore, it is in the way when on the camera. I do like that I can be in pictures withough using the delayed release on my camera. SO I would buy it again. I do wish there was a better product available for my camera. I am dissapointed by Nikon."
4,Does what it says,"I just received this item. While I agree that it is pricey and the functionj should be built-in like the D70, it does work as stated. If a flash is needed, there is a bracket that can be purchased to hold the receiver...or a small piece of Velcro would work too. The infrared trigger works well for me...and annoys the cats. It is a little bulky, but not huge."
1,It hurt my eyes...,"In the quest to reduce waste, you would do well to eliminate this book from your reading list. If you are looking for a guide to visual management (tools, techniques), this book comes up (way) short. Although the author acknowledges that visual management is part of a lean workplace, it is obvious she has little knowledge or experience with either. Her utter lack of understanding of accepted terminology, redefining of basic definitions, bad examples, and other glaring errors make this book a 'must miss'. Do yourself a favor and steer clear of this one (put the money in your retirement fund!)"
1,If I could give it zero!!!!! Waste of $50,"The front wheel is akimbo, took it to the local bikeshop for advice, they said this model is JUNK! They used to sell something like this, but the front wheel hub is junk and wobbles 3 inches off center! It's impossible to fix and the parts department (Kettler) will not send a replacement front wheel (blew me off)! The whole front hub assembly is irreparably bent and off center (factory error)Impossible to ride, plus the pedals are impossible for my son to keep his feet on!We bought it way ahead of my sons birthday and now too late to return, Amazon won't take it back.Just take out a $50 and burn it... or you can take a chance on this piece of worthless junk."
5,This thing is great!,I really like this mailbox! It's big enough to hold a weeks worth of mail and it's locked so I feel comfortable that my mail will be there when I go to get it. No more bothering the neighbors to empty my mailbox for me when we go on vacation. It also has a clean simple design that doesn't attract too much attention to itself hanging near my front door.
5,Extremely helpful,"The book had many study questions and different perspectives to look at the story through, making it easy to use with both my 8 yr old and my 12 yr old. I would buy other products from this line."
3,Good but not what you expect...,"I purchases this movie because I have others from the same director and they are generally outstanding. This movie is of high quality as well, not your usual pornographic movie, since it deals with real people and their real emotions. However, I was more than a little disappointed since from the title and everything, I expected something about the couples. And I am sure most others do, as well. However, this is each person individually, starting with the interview and then going into a masturbation exercise. While this is fun the first time, it quickly becomes boring person after person. Certainly not a movie recommended for couples, because there is not much for couples."
2,Poorest Carradine Post-Apocolyptic Warrior movie of his career...(Pls. read on),"Second time Luke Askew v. Carradine in desertWarrior film, first was 1984's Warrior andthe Sorceress. Carradine still used the capeand outfit in this movie as well! In 1989'sgem, Wizards of the Lost Kingdom II, sequelto 1985's Bo Svenson's Wizards of the LostKingdom, Carradine's fight scenes from 1984'sW.A.T.S. were spliced in here. Jillian Mc-Whirter, once co-starred with Carradine in1989's Nowhere to Run. Warlords and W.O.T.L.KII were way better than this below averagecheapie!"
3,An average conclusion to a wonderful trilogy.,"Elizabeth Boyle can write the best swashbuckling fun ever. Masquerade, intrigue, passion... she can do all of these wonderfully. ""Brazen Angel"" was superb, ""Brazen Heiress"" very good, and this, her latest, is just so-so.Oh, the exciting intrigue is still there. However, ""Brazen Temptress"" is basically a Big Misunderstanding story. A very well-done BM story, but nonetheless, the story is driven by the hero's incomprehensible refusal to set the story straight early on (probably because otherwise there will be no story!). Seeing the heroine being put through suspicions after suspicions, just because the hero won't talk, becomes very irritating after so much and ultimately spoils the fun."
3,Slooowww...,"Um...first off, I would like to say that Maureen is a very stupid girl. I know it's the point of the book for her to find the truth and so forth, but come on nobody is THAT dense! The book didn't really get me interested in what was coming next, like Boyles other books had... The ending was actually ok..I definetly think the writer could have done a better job on this last book in the D' Artiers trilogy."
5,Does It Work For The PS2,"OK, let me get this straight. YES, it does work for the PS2 becuase the PS1 and PS2 have the same outlet type and same electricy quantity. So, if you have a LCD screen or tv in your car, this is a must."
2,Misleading,"I purchased this product, and although it does work, the image was misleading. Bought what i thought was the actual PSone charger turned out to be a cheaply China made black car adapter. When i opened it the rubber wire housing was exposing the wires. I would not recommend this if youre looking for the actual Sony brand product. It works, but its cheap."
4,Mobile Fun For Less!,"Check out Ebay for these at half price! Otherwise a great item, that makes the kids shut up for a long drive while playing the PSone!!"
2,too partisan to merit more than 2 stars,"Corn is a bright, sincere man, but like everything else he has done it is a party-line screed.For example - In his into, Corn says, ""He has misstated facts, knowingly or not."" Most people would separate willful misstatements from unintentional ones. Corn does not.If you hate Bush you'll love the book, if you love Bush you'll hate the book. If you're looking for something balanced try Bush at War by Bob Woodward. Conservatives think it's a liberal book and vice-versa - maybe that's a good sign."
2,Half Lies/Half truths,"What this book does not point out are the lies that really matter. Like Bush not only knowing 9/11 was going to happen but wanting and help make it happen. I'm tired of people making out W to be 'JUST' a bad president, when it is clear he has had connections with bin Laden. A good book to check out about the real truth is ""9/11 the Road to Tyranny"" which if you can't find here you can find at www.infowars.com"
4,Hard to Get Through But Compelling,"David Corn's book is essentially a compendium of the Bush history of lies and deception that began during his candidacy for governor of Texas. President Bush and more importantly, his administration are exceedingly manipulative, untruthful and unfit to hold the public trust. Mr. Corn provides a panoramic view of the Bush Administration's deceit. The book is not an easy read, and its hard prose is indicative of Mr. Corn's stridency. However, it is compelling and though provoking. The reader should however read pro-Bush tomes by Mr. Hannity and company and come to their own conclusions about the trustworthiness of the president. I for one made up my mind when he was governor of my state several years ago..."
3,"Good info, but very dry","The information is good, and well presented, but as someone already mentioned, it really reads more like a laundry list instead of investigating the reasons behind what will one day be looked on as the most damaging presidential administration this country has ever (hopefully) survived. It isn't bad, just isn't really deep.[...]If anything, this poor slob's review actually gives more merit to this book than is probably due, based on the author's investigative style at least. I guess a lot of the laundry list of lies the author points out must really be on target though, to rile a conservative nutjob like the aforementioned reviewer, into such a defensive posture. Kudos to the list of lies and their acid effect of truth on supporters of those lies, but again, it could be better written."
5,Wake up!,"Not only did Bush lie, he knew it. Just a comment to all you people who say, ""Well, Clinton lied too!"" Whan Clinton lied, nobody died."
1,lies about lies,"Incredibily dishonest book. I was disguested with the war, but I could not finish this book was was based on lies and inuendo."
5,"The Facts, backed up by comprehensive research.","In a wonderful style that is respectful of journalism's important ""who, what, when, where, and why"" ideal, David Corn presents startling facts on the numerous lies and falsehoods of George W. Bush.The research to back up Corn's claims is extensive.Excellent eye-opener."
4,Documented deception by Goerge W.,"Corn gives a rapid fire parade of Bush's calculated distortion of the truth before and during his presidency. The weightiness of his disclosures are moderated somewhat by his rapier wit. Careful documentation makes this account virtually impossible to dispute. If this were fiction, the tale would be unbelievable, but as fact it is an incredible inditement of this administration's slickness and slipperiness with facts."
1,Are We Really This Stupid?,"[...]First of all, the author needs to find out what the word ""lie"" actually means. When a person tells a lie, he is saying something that is not true when he knows it is not true. With the WMDS issue in Iraq, Bush actually did not lie. He was merely stating something that he believed to be true when it was found that is wasn't true. He even apologized for it![...]"
1,How can this author right such lies?,I read this book and thought can this all be true? So I read two more books written about 9/11 & the President. Each book I read totally dismissed the lies and misleading ideas of this book. This unfortunately is another left-wing attempt to tell us we are stupid and can't think for ourselves. So this author will do all the thinking for us. I am glad I read other books to get a clearer picture. It is so hard to find anything fair and with proven facts. Don't waste your time with this one.
1,Don't buy it!,This belt isn't leather it is leather over junk vinle stuff that will separate in about 2 weeks. Worst money spent in my life.
1,badly constructed,I was very dissapointed with the purchase. The belt fell apart shortly after purchasing. The layers of leather and cardboard? started to seperate. I finally just threw it away.
2,Belt,"It's a cheap belt but then so is the price. No complaints, you get what you pay for. It is exactly what the seller claims it is."
2,lather belt,BELTMASTERS MENS/WOMENS BLACK LEATHER BELT FOR BUCKLES M MEDIUM (34-36)the item was inexpensivethe belt stains my jeans and the punched holes for the buckle to hold start ripping after a few days wearingI would rather pay more and get a good quality
4,pleasantly surprised,"I bought this as a gift for my brother, so I can't comment on the fit. But given it's extremely low price, I was very pleasantly surprised by the good quality of the materials."
3,Small,"While the belt is good quality, it's not a 34-36 size belt as described. I wear 33-34 size pants and even with the belt buckle I have for it, it barely fits. I have to put it through the first hole and even then it's still tight."
3,A great cycle buried in muffled sound quality.,"An outstanding cycle from a performance perspective. Dohnanyi and Cleveland are precision itself in many of the symphonies, especially 5 and 7. The real tragedy here is that these great performances were captured with Telarc's cavernous sound quality. The whole set sounds like was recorded in a cave. So don't buy this expecting a digital orgasm, but rather for the stunning musical interpretations. (Sorry Telarc)."
5,A MUST have!,"This is a tremendous collection! Dohnanyi and the Cleveland Orchestra are incredible on these CDs...They are full, precise, and beautiful. A MUST HAVE for any Beethoven or classical music fan."
3,"it would be excellent set, but ....","the sound quality is very poor, so overbassed, muffled sound like this can be rarely heard...."
4,"Solid, right down the middle","I'd liken these performances to the ""Joy of Cooking"" cookbook. They're something everyone just has to have. You get consistent, unadulturated Beethoven, and listening to them 1-9 really shows you how the composer evolved. The musicianship is impeccable, and the pacing is definitely on the brisk side, which I think is a good thing for these symphonies. There are times where the sound was a little thin, but that's a nitpick. Go put this set in your collection."
4,Excellent book,This is a great book for entry level knowledge. It can easily become the bible of any entrepreneur and business person (or wannabe).
3,Lacks Indepth coverage & is no alternative to an MBA,Of the 10 core subjects covered I have taken courses in at least a few and what I see is that this book might mislead someone to believe that they know all that is needed to function in the real world.The real usefulness of the book will be if you were to read the more on the content covered from other books. This way the book could specifically tel you what subjects to focus on
5,An amazing business book,"This is one of the most interesting and most informative business books I have read. I work as a techie in a Decision Support System job and have always found the need to learn some MBA basics like accounting and finance. This book not only explains the basics of different MBA subjects, it does so in quite an entertaining way. The book has lots of examples and can be understood by anybody. I'm planning to read the book once again carefully to be able to apply some of the concepts in my career. I'd definitely recommend this book."
5,"A Is For Adultery, Angst, and Adults Only","I thought this was conceptually quite clever. The chosen word choices, with attendant watercolor illustrations, were also very unique. There is no doubt this is a true artist at work."
1,"Very cute, but...",what a waste of money! My 2 1/2 year old son LOVES Blue so of course I bought this for him. He likes that it makes noises but that is all it does! My son gets bored with this toy in a matter of seconds.
1,Ultimate 3-D rubbish?,"I recently bought this Ultimate 3D horror collection. I already have the Ultimate 3D Imax collection which is excellent. However the Horror collection was a complete disappointment. I think they must have had a budget of about [$] (and that is for all three films). The acting is apalling and the entire films looks as though they was filmed with a couple of cheap camcorders with the Nu-View system attached. The 3D effects are iffy at best. If you're choosing between this and the IMAX 3D package then DEFINITELY go with IMAX. I just wish, being a big fan of 3D films, that the big hollywood studios would take note that there is a lot of demand for 3D DVDs, and re-release all their big production 3D movies of past years in field sequential format on DVD. Maybe someday!"
5,Best Baroque Organ Ever,"As reviewer David Kemp states so well in his review, this Telarc recording is the greatest. The Gabriel Kney Organ is an up-to-date version of the Silbermann organ at Arlesheim, about the same size and similar registration. However, the reeds are just fantastic and add a thrilling aspect to Bach organ music. I have always admired and enjoyed the Arlesheim instrument, but the Kney organ tops it, even in the pedal which has more 16' stops, as well as a 10 2/3 quint. As stated the acoustic is perfect, the playing superb and the recording wonderful.I couldn't ask for any better than this recording. I greatly admire Gabriel Kney."
2,adobe photoshop elements 2.0 a visual introduction to digita,"This book is definitely not an introduction to digital imaging. What it is, a well organized and illustrated book listing the features of Photoshop Elements and what can be accomplished with it. This book is not something you can follow to perform various digital manipulations. In fact I believe that it is no better than using the help section of the program, which comes free with the program! After trying the book I found free material on several web sites that had good detailed steps to follow. this book should offer typical cases with step by step instructions."
5,Tuff Cord - Hunter Green,"I searched high and low for this handset cord and finally located it on Ebay. The selling agent was excellent and very quick about getting it to me. My wife was very pleased that we didn't have to swap out the kitchen wall phone, just because we couldn't find a replacement cord for it."
2,Least favorite of all the Strawberry Shortcake series,Save your money and buy a different Strawberry Shortcake video. Honey Pie the horse should be shot and put out of her misery in this movie. I cringed every time I had to listen to her whine. We much prefered Beach Party and Spring for Strawberry Shortcake.We've also found that all of this series are shakey. Something to do with transfering it to digital made the quality diminish.
2,"Horrible, teaches a bad lesson.","The lesson in this story (by the end) is to appreciate your friends. They do a HORRIBLE job of depicting this. Instead you get the feeling that the message is to ""whine until you get your way"" or ""give someone that whines anything they want."" My husband refuses to let my daughter watch this movie. Honey Pie is whiney and really needs to get the treatment that race horses get when they hurt their leg."
5,Strawberry Shortcake get well adventure,These dvds are very cute. I used to watch these as a child and now my own child can enjoy them as well.
2,My daughter rejected this one,"I should have paid attention to the reviews. My daughter really likes Strawberry Shortcake and has really enjoyed most of the DVDs from this version of Strawberry Shortcake. (She's not crazy about the new Strawberry Shortcake show that's on HUB right now.) However, after about 15 minutes of this DVD, she stopped watching and told me she wasn't interested in it. She said that Honey Pie was annoying and that it was ""totally boring and annoying."""
2,the horse is very annoying,"Poor Strawberry.. she is such a sweet kid, but the horse's whining and grouching overpowers this whole movie. My daughter doesn't like this Strawberry Shortcake movie as much as she likes the others."
3,not as good as other SSC dvds,"My 4.5 year old daughter has a lot of Strawberry Shortcake dvds and for whatever reason, this one wasn't as interesting for her."
1,Body Glove Tinny,"I tried this unit in the store, and the quality was terrible! The audio sounds like the inside of a tin can, and the mic, which I reviewed by sending a message to my voice mail, is even worse! I wish it performed as good as it looks, because it looks cool! The Nokia earpiece and mic combo, although unglamorous, is head and shoulders above the body glove! I use it every day for business, and my clients don't even know that I am using a headset."
1,"twice bitten, thrice cynical","When I purchased this item I was very impressed with it's comfort and aesthetics. It also had very good clarity of sound. When my first Body Glove fell apart within a week, I figured I had clumsily yanked it. I purchased another and the same defect occurred (the metal piece came out of the holder). Enuf."
2,Dont buy!,"I bought this thinking it was a great deal. Its a famous name brand but it's [weak]. It stopped working in a month, kept slipping off my ear and it tangles up. Amazon.com was great about replacing it, but quess what? The second one stopped working too.So do yourself a favor and go to [a local store]. I bought one for half the price and it has worked for over 4 months."
4,The best I've used so far,"Can't really comment on the other user's experience, however, I have been thoroughly pleased with the product so far (I have it for about 6 weeks now.). It fits very comfortably and the sound quality has been good. My phone carrier is Voice Stream in the NY/NJ/CT tri-state area. Voice Stream on the other hand, stinks!"
1,Be Careful!!!!!!,"I have never spent so much money on such a large volume that has so little useful information. If you are using Vista, check the other books available, this focuses on XP. I also bought 'Using Office 2007' and it is the same. The reading and explanations are easy to follow and understand, but I have found only a couple in each book that actually work. I do not know whether the high ratings given these books are XP users who have used limited information; but the ratings sure fooled me. I borrowed a 'Dummies' book and it has much more useful information."
2,Outlook 2007,"The book is too big; therefore it's overwhelming, and a lot to digest at once. But I'm trying to get through it."
1,Not a good book,"I bought this book because I plan to buy a jointer/planer. I am not a professional but, in spite of my somewhat low level, the book did not give me much useful information. It is mostly a collection of trivialities, such as instructions for making a stand in mdf board, or 1 1/2 pages with ridiculous instructions on how to remove a motor (disconnect wires, remove bolts, remove belt, remove pulley if necessary...). There is no useful info on combined jointers/planers. Flowcharts on choice of jointers/planers seem useless. I do not recommend this book to anyone. The chapter on jointers and planers in Duginske's book ""Mastering Woodworking Machines"" gives much more information in much less space."
2,Holmes 2041 vs Honeywell HW628 window fan,"I recently compared the Holmes and Honeywell (Kaz) twin window fans side by side. Both were reasonably quiet, electronically reversible, and were similarly priced (Lowes and Target, respectively). The Holmes fan is more attractively designed but the Honeywell had 2 to 3 times the blowing strength as the Holmes. Also, the Honeywell fan (but not the Holmes fan) has angled louvers which can be turned to direct the flow from each fan in a different direction. I don't know which fan is built more to last, but based on the airflow, I purchased the Honeywell."
3,Great fan until it gets dirty,"I bought this fan at my local (independent) hardware store. It's served me faithfully for three years, all year long (I live in a prewar Manhattan apartment building with steam heat, and this fan is used all winter long!) The fan is whisper-quiet, even at the highest setting, and I love the thermostat function as well as the intake/exhaust function. However, with regular use, it gets filthy, and as I just discovered, impossible to clean without damaging. I feel bad that I killed my faithful fan! :( Why oh why do they make these without being able to easily disassemble and clean? The buildup of New York soot and grime requires a good soap-and-water cleaning!"
1,unsatisfied customer,"I was VERY disappointed in this Holmes Twin fan. When set on the HIGH setting it is at best, equal to the LOW setting on most SMALL fans! Wish I would have sent it back! Win some...lose some!! :-)"
3,twin fan,The fan functioned reasonably well but we felt the speed settings did not allow for a high enough speed to feel a big difference. It was easy to set up and had an accordion type extender on one end and a fixed slide in extender on the other which did a good job of filling the window space.
4,"Works good-Long warranty, failed once but got replacement",Works good. Failed once after a year but got a replacement at no charge (no shiiping charge either) from Holmes. It works good and does what its supposed to do.
1,wow,"I did not get what I ordered, so review is tricky. Have tried to review this item 3 times. None posted. Just beware. The item pictured is NOT what you get. A cheaper model is sent. Pictured item not even available. Again this item is NOT available (model 2041)."
3,"Ok for price, but reverse (exhaust) is weak.","Fan is lightweight, EZ to set controls, and quiet enough.But reverse (exhaust) airflow seems less than half (50%) of intake flow.My 8-year-old identical-looking model has only slightly less exhaust than intake.Still, it's very good for the price; nothing like it. Single-fan units either too weak or very noisy."
2,Unreliable,"The fan was bought to relplace an identical existing fan. The left side fan blade had stopped working on that one. On this new one the left side fan blade is temperamental and needs to be switched on and off several times just to get it working. Not good quallity, if you ask me."
2,Poor Quality Toy,Blue lasted only 2 weeks before the music paw stopped working and we were left with only the annoying barking paw. Contacting the manufacturer left me frustrated. I would not buy this toy as a gift.
5,Love it,"All I got to say, Ordered Two More, day vision great and night vision was just as great. Hope next two are as good"
1,Very Cheap Looking,"I bought 2 of these rugs and did not want to bother returning them, but they were a BIG waste of money. They look nothing like the picture."
1,Do not purchase from Kantrexplaza,"I ordered 2 Primera 53318 Signature III Color Ink Cartridges ($74)and Both were Defective, one printed all Green and the other would not print at all. Is sent a request to kantrexplaza the company that Amazon site sent me to.I have sent several request to return the products and have only received responses from Amazon..Kantrexplaza never returned my Calls or responded to my email..So I now have to re-order the cartridges which will not be from kantrexplaza...I don't understand why companies don't back up the products they sell..This Sucks.."
3,"Usually prints well, but problems with some cartridges","I've used the Primera Signature III for about 6 years. During that time I have probably used 12 color ink cartridges, and I have had ""banding"" problems with 3 of them. By ""banding"" I mean that prints come out with stripes of the correct color, mixed with stripes of missed or blank areas.I originally worked with Primera support and ended up scanning samples of printed discs that showed the problem, and after trying several things and running many cleaning cycles it came down to a bad cartridge. From then on, any time this happens I try cleaning the cartridge and if the quality does not come back, then I buy a new cartridge. I've thrown away 3 cartridges now that were over half full.I still have the Signature III, but because of the difficulties I bought a newer disc duplicator that uses Lexmark printer components, and so far I have had no printing problems with it.When the cartridge for the Signature III works, it works well."
5,A saint book unlike any other!,"Anyone who wants to know and love the saints more, but does not want to read fifty-seven different books will find this book a treasure beyond belief! We own many books about saints, but we keep coming back to this one. There are stories about those familiar favorites such as St. Paul and St. Francis of Assisi. Also, there are lesser-known saints, such as St. Peregrine and St. Dymphna. These are often hard to find information about, especially on a child's level.The book is full of details and very well written. The stories are engaging and make you feel like you are there. Luckily each saint is covered in only five to ten pages, because the children would not want to stop until the story is finished. This is truly our favorite saint book. We highly recommend it!"
2,Much too graphic for a child's book,"I bought this book for my 9 year old daughter, however quickly took it away from her. One of the stories of the saints, although true, is so frightening and graphic, it was quite disturbing (involving molestation). This book is certainly NOT for 9 year olds; perhaps a teen. I haven't read all of the chapters, but I don't intend to give this back to her if I find any more inappropriate stories."
2,Poor quality,"Tip came off within 3 uses, laser is of course a lazing LED but the life of batteries left alot to be desired."
1,laser and PDA pointer doesn't work,Pen and light work but no laser and PDA pointer doesn't work with Ipod itouch. No instructions just some printing on outer box
1,Great idea still in search of a solution,"I like the idea of this pen: ink, stylus, light and lazer pointer. Too bad this particular item doesn't fill the bill. To begin, the pen is too long, about an inch too long. Because it is heavier than most pens, and because that weight is distributed unevenly (toward the top) the thing is awkard to hold. Terrible balance. Making things worse, the finish is very smooth, so the pen tends to slip around in your hand. The stylus is great, but it requires both hands to switch from the stylus to the pen (requires twisting or rotating the two ends in opposite directions). Finally, the ink pen glides over the paper like the tip of an X-acto knife. So, poor balance, clumbsy mechanics and mediocre performance. Strike three. Find something else."
3,what a pen!,"Well, I bought this pen just so that I could reach $25 and have free delivery, so I never used it. It looks good!"
1,very poor quality pen,"I purchased three of these, out of those three pens only one would actually write. Very disappointed in this purchase"
4,Cool little gadget,"I carry this around and use it for my job, which is nice to just be writing notes then use the laser pointer to point to an object that is being discussed and go right back to righting without digging around for a pen and then going back to a laser pointer and so on, or trying to ballance petween holding a folder, papers, a pen and a laser pointer. It has held up after falling off a roof and still works like new. Not sure yet about changing the ink cartridge, but for making quick notes while working it seems to do a really good job."
1,dissatisified,"I bought this 4-1 pen (laser pointer,flash lite,stylus and pen) it does everything except one the stylus doesn't work on my ipad. Why I don't know but I really think that it should do what it advertises to do.."
4,"Good quality, slightly different from picture","The pen is great, and light. The light is surprisingly bright for it's size, and the laser hasn't dimmed after a couple weeks. The difference between the product and the picture is the case is made out of plastic, and it doesn't have a gripper. Otherwise, it would have been perfect."
2,NOT Capacitive - won't work with iPad/Touch/Phone,"Note that this is NOT Capacitive - will not work with iPad/Touch/iPhone screens. Pen switch mechanism turns one way for pen, the other way for plastic tip. OK, but not an elegant product."
4,Laser pointer,"Great product, very affordable, useful, and great fun. my cat and dog love to chase the laser around. it is also so fun just to create some sort of light show and perfect for presentations. The entire concept of putting 4 things in one was great, i use the stylus all the time, then to write down my notes, i can just switch to the pen. the flashlight works as a great tool as well. highly reccommened for anyone shopping for a laser pointer, get this if anything else"
2,Shrinking lights,Love all the functions but within a week the lights kept sinking further into thr pen making the lights useless.
4,"Very Cool Laser, Pen, Light, & Stylus - Recommended!","The ""Executive Style 4-in-1 Pen"" is a very cool gadget Pen that also holds a bright LED light, red laser pointer, and PDA Stylus.The Pen ships in a nice foam padded presentation case and comes with 3 batteries pre installed (so it works out of the box), and 3 replacement batteries in the box.Both the laser and LED light are very bright and work well.The Pen end twists to produce the pen or the stylus tip (very clever).I bought several of these to give as gifts to my wife and kids since they use the stylus for their DS game system and the laser to play with our cats. They were a big hit!This is a well made and fairly inexpensive gadget that has brought much enjoyment. Recommended!"
1,Laser Doesn't Work - Poor Quality - Bad Batteries,"Right out of the box, neither the light nor the laser worked. So I replaced the batteries with the extras included in the box, then the light worked only slightly. I mixed and matched the 6 batteries I had because I noticed that 3 of them looked like they had leaked and were in bad shape. Finally I got the light to work but the laser never did. In fact, it looked like the laser was completely missing. I also did not like how the device switched between the pen and the stylus - neither of which were very impressive. I returned the product and I only received half $3.50 approximatley of the purchase price and none of the shipping and handling (mostly handling) that cost me about $15. If you like to play russian roulette then buy this product - maybe you will get a good one maybe you won't. Otherwise I would avoid this product in the future."
2,Does not work as iPad or IPhone stylus,Does not work as iPad or IPhone stylus. I bought a bunch of these to give as presents since many of my friends have iPhones and iPads. Unfortunately it does not work as a stylus. The pen and lights are fine.
2,Poor Quality Construction Pervades This 4-in-1 Pen,"Unfortunately, I find this pen to suffer from poor quality construction. The laser pointer and LED light components of the pen seem to work well--the other end is the problem. The ballpoint pen writes poorly. The ink does not roll out smoothly. Of course the pen-insert can be replaced, but it's really not worth replacing. The greater problem with this 4-in-1 device is that the twisting mechanism that allows you to select between pen and stylus is loose--it's poorly and imprecisely machined--so the extruted tip doesn't stay out when you apply pressure to it (i.e. when you try to write). You can feel the intended catch when you twist the barrel, however the it doesn't actually catch. Not adequately anyway. Point is, you get what you pay for, and I recommend you look elsewhere."
1,Do not waste your money.,"At first glance this product appears to be very convenient to all of us that prefer to have all in one accessories, but I was sadly disappointed once I opened the box.Yes, it is not expensive, that does not mean it should be cheaply made. The outer material is ok, some sort of metal which makes it look professional and it is not heavy. The design is practical, with the buttons where needed in order to use it while in the go. However, I was never able to evaluate the light as it simply did not work. At first I thought it was the battery, so I changed them and tried again... nothing. It simply did not work.We are located in Mexico, so there was no point on paying more than what the product's price to send it back to US and replace it... after all, the product itself as mentioned, its just cheaply made."
3,Okay,"I bought two of these. On one of them the batteries were DOA, luckily it comes with a second set. The larger issues is that the pen is cheaply constructed. Both pens quickly cracked where the bottom and top screw together. Unfortunately this is also where the batteries reside. Now every time I put any pressure on the top (for instance when I push the laser button) the pen falls apart and the batteries fall out. The price is great, but the quality is lacking."
1,worthless,"This is truly a disapointment. The pen does not work, the light does not look like a LED light and the laser doesn't shoot solid red dot. I dont recommend this pen to anyone who will use it for work. I recommend this pen as a paper weight or toy for a 7 year old. I was very disappointed with this product."
1,Imported to Australia,"This laser is illegal in Australia and cannot be imported. I had confiscated by customs through the post. Save your money, don't attempt to get this into AUS."
2,Crap product. I don't recommend this one.,"Quality/Looks of product: 2/5Operation of product: 2/5Overall Rating UPDATED To: 2.5/5This item looks cool in the picture but upon receiving it, it becomes quite apparent that it's been cheaply made. You struggle to put new batteries into it as the pen won't screw together properly. Also, the batteries die out quickly and the laser barely works after an hour of use.The 2/5 I'm issuing to this product is GENEROUS- it should have gotten less. It only gets that because I thought it was cool for the first 30 minutes that it DID work. Don't waste your money on this.EDIT: Upon further review of the product, I've issued a new product rating of 2.5/5 instead of 2/5. This is because the pen its self writes pretty good so it could still be used for something.."
1,Don't buy for tablets or Blackberry,"Does not work on Blackberry, Blackberry Playbook, or Apple iTouch. I only purchased to use for my Playbook. It looks nice but that's about it."
2,There is better,"This is not a bad performance of the Brahms concerto, but it's nothing very special either. I mean, the finest ever? Come on. Gutierrez is a solid pianist but not one who does anything particularly interesting, and the same can be said about Previn's conducting. For a modern performance that uses a similar approach to this one but with far more success, try Kovacevich/Davis. Among historic performances, Schnabel/Boult, Solomon/Dobrowen and Fischer/Furtwangler are mandatory listening too."
4,Not made in Germany,"I purchased this spatula since I already have several Rosle cooking utensils. It seems well made, my only complaint is that it was made in China instead of Germany. All my other utensils were purchased in Germany and I assumed the one I ordered from Amazon would be from Germany as well."
5,One of the BEST books on nutrition.,"I am 24 year old male and my nutritionist recommended this book to me along with the China Study.This book makes so much sense, I have purchased over 5 copies already for gifts and loaner books. That is how dedicated I am to getting Dr. FUhrman's message out to people who want to know the healthiest way to eat and live.This guy truly cares about your health and has reversed and cured tons of people.You must own this book, everyone in the world should own this book or have at least read it.$15 for a book that is priceless. Buy this book you will not regret it."
4,More Cross References,"The book's information is most useful. The recipes are delicious. My personal preference would be that when referring to the name of a recipe in the suggested menus, the location of the recipe name should have the page number of the method next to it. The book itself was in excellent condition."
5,Recommended to all,"This is a great book and I recommend it to everyone. I have actually ordered two more copies for my mom and cousin to read. It is very imformative and easy to read. If you are interested in nutrition, losing weight or just being healthy, get this book!"
3,Easy Diet but Boring,"The diet is very easy to follow, fruit for breakfast, soup and salad for lunch, salad, cooked veggies and fruit for dinner. It can be extremely boring depending on the variety of fresh fruit and veggies available to you if you are not an adventurous eater.The book also fails to discuss the topic how drinking alcohol, beer and/or wine affects this diet. My husband and I have been on it for a week. This is summer so the variety of fruits and vegetables is great, however my husband is tired of eating salad, salad and more salad already. I don't think we will make it through the six weeks."
4,It was good.,It gave me a lot of good information. I read so many weight loss books and can find something in them all that I can use. I just wish that you people would get on the same page. That is why I keep reading.
5,Sustaining health,Following the guidlines set forth in this book has helped my husband and I to regain our health. At age 70 we need to be our own best advocate and continue to educate ourselves because most doctors do not study nutrition and most nutritionists that I have encountered follow old guidelines to the benefit of industries not the populace.
2,"Save your money, get this at the library so you can return it.","Although recommended by a friend, this was a letdown. Bigger than most diet books.I'll save you the money and reveal the plot:1. Why all the other diets are no good, in gory detail - (3/4 of the book)2. Why you should become a vegetarian (a chapter or so)3. Some recipes in order to tolerate an all veggie dietGo to a library to thumb through it. This book isn't a keeper."
3,Mediocrity at its best.,"This book, Eat To Live, was okay. Just okay. Written just like any other diet or nutrition book. I thought it was a nice idea in theory, but I felt...for lack of a better word, empty, after reading it. Nothing set this plan apart from any other, and It seemed somewhat unrealistic. I think that if you have boundless resources and no social life, this diet might work. But for the average person, it just wouldn't work. The food was far too expensive, and it seemed very hard to carry out in everyday life, at work, or school. It was okay, just not for me."
2,A Waste of Time and Money,"Here's the miracle advice to lose weight, overcome all of your medical problems, and begin a new life: eat a pound of greens plus some fruit and beans, every single day, for six weeks. No animal protein; no dairy products. Well, no kidding. Who wouldn't lose weight with this regimen?"
5,eat to live,breakthrough diet plan -- could reverse effects of thestandard american diet (SAD) that over 95% of americanscurrently eat -- scientifically based on over 1500 peerreviewed studies -- fritz kleman
5,Best Book You'll Buy For Your Health and Weightloss,If you buy one book on losing weight and health make sure this is it. Fuhrman explains how to lose weight without feeling hungry or deprived through the use of nutrient density. Imagine feeling full on just 1500 calories a day and feeling more energetic and healthy at the same time while also preventing many debilitating diseases such as diabetes or heart disease. Eat to Live explains what's wrong with the American diet and how you can get back on track and reclaim your health and body. Chapter 8 gives his recipie for weight loss and it works. Highly recommend!
4,So easy! It works!,"I'm 46 years old, overweight and tired of it. I went to my doctor for a routine visit and I brought up that I'm tired of being overweight and knew that I need to do something about it. He asked me if I ready to make a change and I said yes. He told me to buy this book, follow the steps and watch the weight fall off. I did and he's right!!! The first two weeks I was totally faithful to the 6 week plan and lost 12 pounds. When you see results daily it makes a huge difference. The secret? Go to Costco, buy a big tub of fresh spinanch, top with veggies AND fruit of your choice. For the dressing I use balasmic vingear, no oil...tastes great. Breakfast is oatmeal and fruit. I love to eat and this diet works for me!!! Good luck"
5,The weight will come off!,"Dr Fuhrman gives you the way to do it. He says give it six weeks-in three DAYS I felt a major difference. Higher energy, clearer thinking, lost weight. This was alot different from always being sick and tired of being sick and tired. Allergies decreased, anxiety decreased, simply from knowing I once again, after years of fatigue, had the energy to deal with problems. Plus I still enjoy meat, eggs, and dessert, I simply decreased it to once a week and still lost 15 lbs easily. Food binges? Still have them-cantelope, celery amd hummus, salad with spicy mustard etc. This is the answer so many people are looking for! Thanks Dr Fuhrman!!"
2,The Impracticable Diet,"I ordered the book just to see what the diet was about, but I wasn't impressed. I will stick with the Mediterranean Diet - much healthier!"
5,The best health path a diet can take you.,"I am so amazed at how different I feel since I started following the advice in this book. I though I was eating healthy before I read this book. Now I know how my body reacts to the foods I have avoided when I try them again. I have no desire to cheat because I can easily tell what isn't good for me. I will be keeping this book, get your own copy!"
5,Best book ever,I've been vegan for years and I thought I was getting all my fruits and veggies... but Dr. Fuhrman has taught me how to achieve the healthiest body possible. He helped us make some major changes in our eating habits - and they were so easy to do! He's a genius!If you want to be healthy and thrive (and not be just another American that lives at the drs. office and is on some medication everyday of their lives) read this book!Don't just live - thrive!
3,I was very hungry on this diet,"I tried incorporating some of the ideas in this book into my already vegetarian diet in an effort to reduce some of the health problems and joint pain I currently have. I do not need to lose weight, but ironically I gained weight on this diet because I was hungry all the time! Eating mostly fruits and vegetables was filling initially, but the sensation of fullness did not last long. I think that this diet as evidenced by the positive reviews may be very doable and benificial for some, but the extremeness of it, even on the most moderate diet plan was too much for me."
1,This book promotes vegetarianism,"I was disappointed to find that this book is simply a promotion for vegetarianism. If you're a vegetarian or vegan, you'll love it. If you believe in a more diverse, well-rounded diet, you'll hate it."
4,Not blown away.,You'll find a lot of info in this book but in some ways it's a little extreme. This book states that the average healthy weight given to us from the medical society is wrong and that to be healthy you must wiegh MUCH LESS that the average healthy weight.
1,Good only for those who want to be vegetarian,I was very disappointed with this book. I found that it did not offer anything new and seems more dated than the other new diet books around. Of course you'll lose some weight if you spent 6 weeks eating largely vegetables. The best diets are those you can stick with. Not many will find this a realistic diet to help them lose weight AND keep it off.
2,Eat to Live,The book was apparently not used but was yellowed and looked very old. I have yet to open it due to the fact that it makes me feel like it would be full of dust.
2,Not for me!,The advice is good... Eat more fruits and veges. But it is very restrictive... Eat ONLY fruits and veges for 6 weeks and 90% of the time after. You dont need to buy this book... It does do a good job of convincing you and I bet it's healthy... But if you enjoy eating variety and dont particularly care for veges I would refrain from buying it. I feel like I wasted $10 because I already knew I would lose weight if I only eat fruits and veges 90% of the time.
5,This Really Works!,"I've been following Joel Fuhrman's instructions for three weeks now and I've lost 10 lbs. I might have lost more but, it took me a while to brake away from my unhealthy eating habits. Anyway, I feel great, I work out three times a week. I recently got another copy of this book for a very good friend that is having some health problelms."
5,This book should be required reading in high school and college!,"Being a Health Educator I have many books on my shelf about nutrition. This is one of the books besides The China Study that I keep referring back to for my classes. I had high cholesterol for most of my life (over 225) and was diagnosed with Hashimoto's Disease in 1999. Since switching to a Vegan Diet, I've lowered my cholesterol under 150, lost those ""last 5 pounds"", increased my energy levels naturally, and kept myself from going on meds for the Hashimoto's. Every one of my friends who have read the book have had similar results. None of them want to go back to the old way of eating and neither do I. I really can't because my tastebuds are permanently changed and I know too much information about how harmful the Standard American Diet fare is for my health. I highly recommend reading this book along with The China Study as part of a person's nutrition education for lifelong health."
4,Eat well to live well,"The book is a great buy, just not enough recipes. I felt amazing after changing my diet and within the first week saw results."
4,nice introduction to healthful eating,"Dr. Fuhrman's book is a well organized, mostly easy to read approach to better eating. I bought two copies after i read it to pass along to those in need. I really appreciated the scienctific support and research that he included. There are some recipes in the later chapters, with many more available through his website, as well as an easy to follow menue plan for the first 6 weeks. its a simple approach and definitely worth the read."
2,More information please,"When purchasing this book I thought based on the description given that it would provide more information and ways to prepare the various vegan food items. I was disappointed in that section of the book. It provided little information other than salads. I've been a vegetarian for over twenty years and was looking forward to hopefuly finding alternative meal prep option than what I have been able to find in the past. Where i live it's hard to come be vegan products, they think you should have a dead animal on your plate.I was hoping to get instrution on different ways to prepare veggies. Also, he advises to follow a six week plan, but only offers a seven day menu.I was disappointed in this product and the description given about the book. The closest book store in over an hour away. If I had been able to see this book prior to purchase I would have seen it wasn't what I was looking for and not made the purchase."
5,SUPERB,A MUST HAVE FOR PEOPLE INTERESTED IN TAKING THEIR HEALTH INTO THEIR OWN HANDS! THIS BOOK HAS THE POWER TO CHANGE YOUR LIFE DRAMATICALLY INTO THE BETTER!
4,Educational,"I really liked reading this book. I am not a vegan, but want to be healthier in my diet choices, and I so appreciated the facts presented on the benefits of natural whole foods. I liked that Dr. Fuhrman never scolded meat eaters, but rather presented documented facts and well-researched material that points to why meat may be a huge problem. I was fascinated by this book because I love to read about nutrition, and there were many things in his book I was not aware of. Highly recommend this, especially to those with cancer history, personal or in family as I have."
2,"Good points, overly stated","My doctor asked me to read this. She thought that it would supplement my healthy lifestyle. The author makes the point that we are what we eat-essentially that to eat saturated fat and animal products and to barely eat green vegetables will set us up for health problems and early death. He cites many scientific studies to support his theories. His arguments are compelling but he states them to the point of reader exhaustion. This book does not have a lot of suggestions for how one would gradually adopt this way of eating. Overall, I will incorporate some of his ideas. I read his newest books which are more specific about how to eat and live this way including sample menus for the first few weeks. They are too restrictive for me but it seems that they are extremely healthy."
3,Too austere for me,"I'm not sure about the science as such in this book, but what the author argues makes excellent sense, and I've tried to adopt his essential point, which is to eat far more nutrient-dense, lower-calorie fruits and vegetables. That said, as a person who likes to enjoy food, this book was just too austere for me. It's not a diet plan that I could adopt long-term or, frankly, short-term either. Since I cook for a two-year-old who's just not that into leafy greens yet (and trust me, I continue to try), it wasn't realistic for my family either. It is an inspiring book, but I guess I eat to enjoy as well as eating to live. For those looking for a similarly healthy approach to weight loss that is a bit more realistic and fun, I recommend ""Eat, Drink and Weigh Less"" by Mollie Katzen and Walter Willett--also a useful book for vegetarians, which few diet plans really accommodate well."
3,"Good diet, if you can stand the food","I read this book and tried it and lasted 2 days. I just couldn't stand eating so many vegetables, whole grains and fruits. It became nauseating. That's the problem with most diets...they have you eating A LOT of a certain food group and you become repulsed by the food after awhile.I do think this diet can be really effective if you can stand to follow it. I just think it's very difficult to follow."
3,Temporary Vegetarian,A lot of the info seems like common sense. It's like Atkins without the meat and fat - almost vegetarian. I am a really committed carnivore though - so I don't thinks I can totally adjust my lifestyle. I have gone about 50% vegetarian which has helped. And I look at the value of whatever I eat. If you have serious health problems it is worth the read.
4,Did you know???,This book is full of information for the way we currently live our lives. It is a good read and can help you make the right choices.
3,"Makes sense, seems healthy but very difficult to follow","I read the book cover to cover, was very excited about the information I learned, then went grocery shopping!My family only lasted a few weeks on the diet. We had horrible stomach pains -- I think maybe it was the sudden increased intake of fiber, especially beans. Maybe we should have eased into it a bit.We are not back to a full-scale meat-eating lifestyle -- we continue to loosely follow his rules of 90% vegetable matter, but we have added in quite a bit more of the fats.There are lots of great tips in this book and we are following the ones that we can. But I think it was just too sudden of a change to our family's diet."
1,"Too many statistics, not enough meal planning. Just eat vegan and save $15!","This book is mostly a lot of trying to convince you with statistics and scientific advice to eat basically Vegan. While I appreciate the fact that most of the evidence is true, there is not enough direction in the form of menus and recipes. The only way to get more information is to join in (not free of course) on Dr. Fuhrman's website.Most people who pick up the book I feel already are ready to make a change and don't need the statistical convincing that he feels necessary to fill most of this book. If you are ready to make a change then save your money on this book and just buy a good vegan cookbook and lay off the processed foods(sugar etc). Not worth the money..."
3,Great Topic...Pourly Written,"I enjoyed the book, I'm a major silverchair fan. My problem with it is that it will be talking about somthing and skip to another time and go back. It's timeline keeps bouncing and gets confusing. It gives the 'chair info but could have been written better."
5,Hi Fi Days = Excellent,"I'm a huge fan of silverchair - them being my favorite band. Not to mention, I'm also a big fan of Australian music. I found this book to be incredibly informative, and just all around awesome! It gives you insight on some cool stuff that you might've not known. If you're a big fan of silverchair, like I am, then I would most definitely recommend purchasing this book."
5,Hi Fi Days: The Future of Australian Rock,"If you're a fan of silverchair, Spiderbait, or You Am I, this book is a must. It's full of information on these three Australian bands as well as many pictures. Overall, Mathieson has done an excellent job on this book!"
3,Is It Worth Your Money ( read this before you buy it),"I am a huge fan of silverchair, i am in their fan club have their autograph and have been to their concerts. Now dont get me wrong this book is cool, but wasn't very well written and didn't explain much. If you want some silverchair stuff, subscribe to their fanclub and you get free stuff catalogues and more. You can subscribe by mail and to figure out how go to chairpage.com which is their official web page"
5,"Definite must for Spiderbait, Silverchair and You Am I fans.","One of the most comprehensive views on three of Australia's best bands. For all you Spiderbait fans this is a definite must have, it will tell you everything you ever wanted to know about Janet, Kram and Whitt plus more! Grab it and add it to your Spiderbait collection."
2,Uhhh... It's Ok...,"I really loved the movie and especially little Frankie. There where three songs that just stuck in my head for weeks, so I bought the CD... unfortunatly out of the three songs, only one was on the CD... I was alittle dissapointed but overall it is a good CD. I really like Jesse Harris. He is the best on the whole CD."
1,Not worth the money,"There is very little use to this book. It has no substance. The practice tests are old, outdated, and poorly reproduced. There are tests in here that are older than I am. Heck, I think some of them are older than my mother.More importantly, there are no explanations given as to why answers are right or wrong. It's just tests, answer keys, and a few paltry paragraphs of less substance than your standard Wikipedia entry. A total waste of money and time."
4,So easy to use,"This product is extremely well made and easy to set up. The material is breathable yet durable. We bring it out and hook the fan up to it, and it's up in under a minute. It also deflates quickly and you can fold it up into it's duffel bag. I think it is well worth the money. We had four children in there at once for my son's second birthday party, it holds up very well and it's easy to reach right in on the sides and pull a child out if you need to. I really thought my kids would want to spend more time in this toy, so I guess my only disappointment is that they want to get out in a couple of minutes, but at least it's not such a big deal to operate. Great for having company, parties, etc."
4,SpongeBob BOUNCY! BOUNCY! BOUNCY!,The kids love it.My only complaint is the unit is hard to fold and get into the bag.Mother of Twin Boys
3,a bit more tattered than we expected,This is certainly still readable and a great price compared to new. But a bit more tattered than we expected.
1,Fire Hazard,"I bought this for my 14 yr old daughter and gave it to her for christmas. Not even two weeks later, she woke up in the middle of the night to get a drink of water and realized that her water was not cold, and decided to unplug it. thank god that she did because when we looked at it the next morning, the ac adapter was burned through and the sides were melted. We are so lucky that this thing did not start her bedroom on fire. I have not yet taken it back to toys r us, so i am not sure what they will do to fix this. I do not reccommend this product until the manufacturer fixes this problem."
3,Holy Hip Hop,Not at all as I expected. I expected more dancing. bought for my grandson to try out some new moves and stay within the Christian realm his parents demand for his music
2,Holy Hip Hop,"This is an okay video documentary on what some artists are doing in the area of creative worship. Its very low quality and ""elementary"" graphics, transitions, and video footage is very low quality.However, I did enjoy some of the testimony's from these youth and young adults praising God in their own unique ways, weither dance, song, rap...you name it.Also, some local artist, Mr. Del, featured on here, was good to see how he is being blessed as a rising artist. Would have loved to see more of the dance routines, everything moves so quickly, doesnt stay on one group long enough to grasp what they are doing."
5,So much fun it earned a detention!,"I bought this tabletop football game for my 7th grader. It is pretty sturdy and arrived in just a couple days. I packed it in his school lunchbox, and he was delighted with it. So delighted, in fact, that he and his friends played it the whole lunch period, neglected to eat their lunches, became a bit overexcited, and earned detentions. Oh well, it really was a lot of fun!"
3,Fun retro toy,"Although very generic (as the title states), the game is exactly what I was looking for. The game board serves no purpose other than to hold the uprights, which is nicer to shoot field goals through rather than making a goal post with your fingers. All in all, for the price, a nice game."
5,Masterful Mozart,"This is a fine album for listeners building their Mozart symphonic collection. The recording quality is tranparent and natural sounding. The material speaks for itself - Mozart's magic touch is purely masterful. Conductor, Charles Mackerras, has a sensitive feel for Mozart's material giving an honest, spirited reading.This is one of several Mozart symphony compilations I have from this series on Telarc records feauturing Mackerras. These recordings are great starting points for building a Mozart symphony collection though there might be better performances available on selected works. That these CD's are available for less than ten dollars makes them even sweeter."
3,Diffucult Saying of Jesus,"As a Christian, I found Ron Rhodes' book very interesting and worth my time. One of two places he parapharazed the Bible scripture and I thought his ""questions"" to be misleading from the point he was making. Overall this book is beneficial for the serious minded Christian. We need more people writing these type books."
2,Only contains the most basic advice...,"Most of the advice contained in this book can easliy be found on the web. It was a mistake to combine Los Angeles and Orange County into one book. Most people have already made up their mind that they are moving to either one or the other. Having information on the county you're not moving to is a waste. Information on various neighborhoods is very limited. The neighborhoods that are included receive only a cursory look, and many neighborhoods are left out."
3,No info on Silverlake or Los Feliz,Important note: This book doesn't contain information about Silverlake or Los Feliz
4,La Here i Come,I really liked this book becuase it was full of usefull information. Im not sure how up todate it is today but i felt really good about the advise.
3,Excellent Guide,"Relocating to Los Angeles, by David Seidman, is an idispensable resource for anyone moving to the city of Los angeles. The book gives an in-depth descriptions of the more popular neighbourhoods, including a breakdown of crimes committed in each neighbourhood and average housing prices. The major weakness in this book is the lack of detailed maps. If you're planning on going appartment hunting, pick a good street map before hand. The book also gives advice on moving, fiting in to your new home, and getting around the city. Beware of some of the e-mail and internet addresses; there are some typographical errors. ... Little errors like this don't hurt the over all value of this book. Relocating to Los Angeles, by David Seidman, is a definite must for anyone thinking of moving to Los Angeles."
2,Don't bother,"I watched this last night. Terrible production. Interviews done on a home video camera. Sound is bad.Not enough interviews. Could have been so much better. I love the subject matter, but boy, was this a waste of time."
3,Animation and sound low quality compared to others,"This show must have been one of the first ones made by DIC in 2003 because the quality is poor compared to the other SS shows I have on DVD. The sound was not mastered and so it gets louder and quieter and is not consistent. The animation is not as sophisticated looking. The lines are too heavy and their noses look too big. The voices are slightly different as well. I'm not sure if my 3 year old daughter will notice but she might. Also the story is all about shopping so I'd say its fairly shallow. That said I love almost all the other DVD's for Strawberry Shortcake in this series, and my daughter loves them too. I bet she will like this but maybe not quite as much as the others we have..."
3,excitement turned to boredom,"I bought this for my almost 4 year old since she's in a Strawberry Shortcake phase right now. She's loved several of the other DVD's, especially Cooking up Fun, the Seaberry one, and the Big Country Fun, but this one she didn't even make it all the way through before wandering off in boredom. She was so excited to see a Christmas Strawberry Shortcake, but it's mostly just Strawberry and, of all characters, Honey Pie (the mouthy pony) wandering around looking for gifts. It would have been much more interesting if the other characters were around to interact as friends and liven things up a bit more."
4,Sweet songs,"I commented on another post about how there is no mention of Jesus in this. I didn't really expect there would be. Aside from that, it is a cute DVD. The songs are sweet and catchy. I do like how they talk about friendship. It is cute, very girly."
5,2princessesmom,Very sweet holiday cheer from Strawberry and all her friends-sweet Christmas songs and situations with Santa Claus-would recommend it.
1,Berry Bad,"In a word: AWFUL. Strawberry Shortcake makes Barney look like a talented genius. Flat characters, extremely low budget animation, and a dull plot are the *best* things this animated children's film has to offer. Worst aspects are the trite, saccharine dialog and the HORRIBLE voices, especially the horse character. My wife and I cringe every time we hear the off-key singing, which is plentiful. And once you've heard the first lame ""berry/very"" switch (e.g., ""that would be berry excellent!"") the remainder are like hitting your thumb with a hammer over and over again. The only reason we play this CD is because our two little girls (ages 5 and 3) enjoy it and there is nothing offensive content-wise. (Indeed, there's almost nothing content-wise, period.) Do yourself a favor and avoid this annoying, tedious stinker. For what it's worth, we greatly enjoyed the Barbie Nutcracker animated movie and would highly recommend viewing it instead."
3,Where's Jesus?,"My girls love Strawberry Shortcake and I was excited to find out that on this DVD Strawberry Shortcake tells the Christmas story - the real one! I couldn't believe it. Well I was a little disappointed when I discovered that it was tucked away in a special feature. My disappointment turned to disgust when the wise men went to Bethlehem to find ""the first Christmas gift."" No mention of Jesus - Political correctness at its worst."
5,Comfort +++,"A+++ product, purchased for my husband. He Doesn't complain about his toes discomfort when worn all day. Medium was the perfect length below the Knee, his pants size is 30"" inseam."
4,Works well for my pregnant sister,"My sister was complaining about the aches she was getting around her legs so her husband would constantly massage them. Walking was also a difficult task for her. Ever since she wore these socks, everything has been much easier. She only wears them before going to sleep but she are able to function normally throughout the day without them. I went onto Jobst officially website determine the size I should get. I would say the size small looks extremely thin when you get them but it slipped on without too much difficulty. If you're worry, you can get the next size up and I think it should be fine."
1,Just deal with it...,"Way, WAY, WAY too much is being made of bullying lately. Back in my day (mid 90's) when we had issues with someone bullying us, we settled it after class. Settled it in the halls, on the playground, in front of school...whatever. We said our piece, made threats, sometimes we fought. We didn't need to shoot each other, we didn't kill ourselves because we were too emotionally weak to handle it. There is no nice way to put it...this generation is soft...plain and simple. The sooner shows like this that coddle the weak minded stop getting made, the better off you'll all be. Just deal with it."
5,Great Fan,"This is a great fan. My parents' house is air-conditioned, but my room, being at the very end of the ductwork, barely gets any air. This fan's exchange and exhaust modes are perfect for my room.The fan runs quiet, and I hardly notice it, even at night. The thermostat is a nice touch, however when the room finally reaches the temperature that's desired, the fan cycles on and off about twice a second, and there is an audible ""click"" each time. An annoyance, yes, but when you take into account that it means the fan has cooled my room 4-5 degrees, the benefits outweigh the slight annoyance of the sound.I would recommend this fan to everyone looking for a good, solid window unit. It will be travelling with me to college, and it looks like it'll serve me well."
5,Holmes HAWF-2097 Remote Control Window Fan,I use this fan to ventilate gas fumes from my Lawn Mower Storage Shed after I've finished mowing so that there is no chance of vapor accumulation or heat buildup in the shed from the Rider Engine........Works Great!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,why would you operate one in and one out?,"the description for air exchange doesn't make sense to me...all you need to do is have another opening in the building...if you pump air in, air will exit out the other opening. if you pump air out, air will enter from the other opening."
1,Holmes thermostat incorrectly designed.,"I purchased a Holmes HAWF3095, twin window fan, with AccuTemp, no remote. The AccuTemp has been designed on basis of a wrong inference: that its operating temperature has two digits. This is a kind of Y2K problem. When the temperature is 9x deg F the readout begins to hesitate, and at 99 the motors start thrashing, changing speeds, stopping, restarting. Even when set up in direct, i.e. bypassing the thermostat, when the temp readout hesitates the motors also vary speed although not as much as when used with the thermostat. Holmes customer service and tech service proved ununderstanding. Until they fit their AccuStats with 3 digit redouts, I advise not to buy the fans if you are going to use them with temperatures above 9x deg F. Definitely not if you are like me in Arizona. I'll return my unit as soon as I purchase a brand/model that provides complete specs for their products. Several email messages sent to Holmes info and tech services were not responded."
4,As bright or brighter than a 100 watt bulb but only uses 26 watts.,"Certainly more light per watt than regular light bulbs, but every now and then I'll hear one of them whine. Not really a big deal for say, bathroom or closet lights where you are in and out, but for a reading light you might not like it. I use them all over the house and in all four of my outside lights. I have noticed that the cold (30-40 degree temp) will delay their full brightness for the first minute or so, but if you need to leave an outside light on all night for security reasons, this is what you want as you get a very bright white light for only 26 watts of power usage.It is a white light, not yellowish like a regular bulb nor bluish like the early CFL models when they first came out."
5,Well done,"A brilliant recording of these two symphonies. The first movement of the 4th sparkles with an energy I've never heard in it before. So does the finale, with a vivacious tempo augmented by crystal-clear perception of each note. The slow movement is taken up-tempo, as is Dohnanyi's wont, but it's played gently and/or passionately as needed, and the overall effect is quite lovely. The same goes for the 8th, where the C.O. displays an impressive mix of playfulness, power, and romanticism. My complaints would be with the last movement of the 8th, which drags a little (odd, considering the conductor), and the overall sound of the CD--it's a little more muffled than Telarc usually allows. However, these symphonies aren't going to get any better than this. Of all the Beethoven symphonies Dohnanyi recorded with the C.O., only the 5th and 7th are done better than these two are, methinks. Buy this CD."
2,Overpriced better to buy in store,I bought this item because i needed erasers for my pencils because i am an engineering student and go through a lot of erasers. I ordered these thinking they were a good deal but a few weeks later i saw them in stores for 2 dollars. I would suggest you buy them in stores instead of on here but they are good erasers.
1,Not worth your $,"I purchased No Easy Days: Snakes in the Cockpit and was very disappointed. I already had No Easy Days: the Incredible Drama of Naval Aviation, (which is fantastic!) and was hoping for the same type of video. Snakes in the Cockpit has very little video of crashes, it is mostly file footage of bombers while a narrarator talks about different crashes."
1,"Very poor in comparison to No Easy Days, Vol. 1","After having veiwed No Easy Days, Vol. I, I was very disapointed in Vol. II. There is very little actual film footage of aircraft mishaps. Generally you are shown videos of the various aircraft flying and then told what happen in various instances, but there is little footage of actual aircraft crashes, unlike Vol. I of No Easy Days. There was no film footage of the B-52 crashing on my Vol. II of No Easy Days as pictured on the cover. Again, if you already have Vol. I, which I highly recommend, you will be very disapointed in Vol. II if you're hoping to view a similar amount of actual aircraft mishaps."
4,The Most Obscure Show in My Collection,"A Great CD. It is interesting to compare this to ""Annie"". ""Annie"" offers a tale of unbridled optimism set in New York. ""Mayor"" offers a realilistic view of the big apple. If such a big name did not write it, I doubt anyone would remember it and this CD would not be available. Which would be a shame. The score has that off-broadway feel combined with an 80's sound made by a synthesiser. The score is witty and catchy. The book and lyrics make it virtually unreviveable. ""The March Of The Yuppies"" is hillarious, but who knows what most of those brand names are. Still, take this chance to get a great score and have an extremely obscure off-broadway gem."
2,"Looking for an office fan, look elsewhere.","If you work in an office environment, you will find this fan too loud. It sounds like a jet turbine even at the lowest speed."
2,TOO LOUD!!!,"The power is great and circulation is very strong, even on lowest setting, BUT... Even on lowest setting the noise is unbearable ~ even in the next room!! It weighs too much to return at my own cost so I kept it, I only use when desperate and only for short periods before the noise drives me nuts and I have to turn it off!"
2,Ridiculously loud,"This fan is loud and blows a lot of air in a small package. I'm unsure the need for such a device. It's really only suited for use in a garage or similar. It is far too loud for indoor use. For those wanting the obscene amounts of airflow I suggest a larger fan that spins slower. For those who want something small, this isn't very useful. This is not a ""desktop fan"".Seems to be well constructed."
2,Way too loud,"I bought this fan for my office, and it's way too loud. I'm returning it today for something quieter."
3,strong breeze but loud,"This fan does a great job of circulating air and cooling a room, but anything other than the lowest setting is pretty darn loud. I ended up returning it, but I do think it's a good fan."
1,not even close to what I ordered!,"I added the blizzard table fan to my amazon wish list. The invoice I got from DEERSO INC. reads sku 519148 ""BLIZZARD TABLE FAN,"" but what is in the box? The Entreeair Door frame fan! Not even close to what I ordered, and there is no phone # or email contact for deerso, only a Florida mailing address. With the lack of an amazon invoice in the box, and no decent contact for deerso, I will just have to eat the $30 and order another blizzard table fan elsewhere. AVOID DEERSO INC!"
1,"Junk, junk, junk.","Lousy junk. The fan sounds like it would burn at any time, and the motor doesn't run at all three speeds. Get a Vornado 610."
3,NOISY!,"Even on the slowest setting, this howls like a maniac.... I can't use it in my office (or anywhere) It's much too loud and makes my ears ring.If you're wanting to move a lot of air and don't mind the noise, great. But I can't."
2,Beware! annoyingly loud fan,"This fan REALLY circulates the air, but don't try to use it in a bedroom at night. It sounds like an airplane engine. I tried to sleep through the night with it on, but kept waking up from the constant din."
2,LOUD,"Pros:- Compact Design- Puts out a lot of airCons:- LOUD- Sounds like a weed whacker- Noisy- Loud- Cannot be taken apart for cleaning- Did I mention that it's loud?This is a fine fan if you have a hearing impairment... but if you have normal hearing, it's going to drive you nuts."
2,"Nice size, toooooooo loud","Needed a small fan for my office...it catches the afternoon summer sun. The fan works fine, is the right size, but it really way too loud for something that size."
1,Waste of Money,"It literally lasted 1 month before the motor died. I sleep with a fan at night so it's pretty important. It wasn't cheap either, I'm really disappointed."
3,Louder than expected,A very powerful little fan. I enjoy the white noise of a fan at night but this one is just a little louder than I would like.
5,great fan,This is a very powerful fan for its' size; I've never had to turn it up beyond low. It can be used on tabeltop or attached to the wall. Highly reccomended.
4,great fan,"i have had this fan for a couple years now, and i love it. i do admit that it's a little noisy on the high setting, but if it's hot, who cares! it's compact yet powerful, i highly suggest it."
1,Don't watse your money on this one.,It worked only 1 day and went dead. It is pretty noisy when you turn it on high due to the fan size. Was very disappointed on this one.
2,Not FANtastic,"I just purchased this product and while it moves tons of air, it sounds like a DC10 taxiing across you room! This thing starts at Low (a swarm of Bees) and continues progressively louder! It went back to the store after the moment I plugged it in. This would be an ideal fan for say a shop or a playroom with 10+ kids in it...."
5,fan,This is not the first time I have purchased the Holmes HAOF-90UC 10-inch 3 speed blizzrd table fan. Over the years I have purchased at least 3 or 4. I love them. I use them daily and have recommended them to friends. The only thing is that you have to be diligent in vaccumming the blades periodically or the dust builds up and the blades tend to rub and make noises that are noticable which can be irritating if you are sensitive to different noise levels.
5,Thanks from Iraq,This was sent to my son who is in the Army in Iraq right now. He was so very grateful to receive it. It meant he could actually sleep a little better with some air circulating in that hot desert.Thank you for the promptness of this order.
4,It is a little loud...,"I use this in my bedroom. See I live in an apartment and have loud neighbors. I need the steady hum of a fan to block out the thuds and shouts from upstairs. So this is good for me, but it may be loud for some. But as far as airflow it seems to be an excellent, powerful little fan, probably no louder than any fan as strong."
2,"Very loud, died after 2 months","Although I read reviews stating that this fan was noisy, I ignored them and rushed ahead with the purchase. While this fan IS quite powerful, those reviews didn't lie: it's so noisy and disruptive that I only used it on the lowest setting. In addition, it spontaneously died after 2 months of use. Granted, I used the fan daily for a couple hours, but I expected it to be more durable. I would spend a couple extra dollars and get a quieter, long-lasting appliance."
3,Not a good bedroom fan,"Others have said it, but I'll say it again: this little guy moves a lot of air but it is way noisy. I hoped to use it in a bedroom but it's far too loud for that. I moved it to my workout room where it is absolutely perfect."
1,piece of garbage - defective?,"it started getting stuck during oscillation within 24 hours, pausing all the way to the left before resuming normal rotationthe 'stuck' pause got longer and longer, until about 6 weeks after purchase it stopped even turning on AT ALL - it's completely broken and i've owned it less than 2 months"
2,the breeze,"This little guy puts out some serious windage no doubt. However, it seems a tad noisy to me."
3,Have 2 of these - and 2 different experiences,"My husband purchased one of these fans several months ago - we've been really happy with it. It moves air well, is compact and does the job. Yes it is a little noisy but we live in NYC so the noise it generates is a good white noise. No problems with it at all.We liked it so much that when the tabletop fan we had in the living room died, I bought another Holmes Blizzard Oscillating Table Fan. Really wish I had kept the packaging one more day as this one is very loud, rattles and hums and generally creates a ton of noise. Much noisier than the other one, even at the same speed and on the same surface. But, I have no way to return it as I didn't keep the packaging."
1,Fan - or noisemaker? Two for the price of one,"This fan is compact and powerful but curiously noisy. It's mildly annoying on low and a whizzing gremlin on high. I have heard quieter leaf blowers. If you are hard of hearing, are unfazed by the sound of screaming children, or are trying to circulate air in an unoccupied room, this could be one way to go. Myself, I would almost rather just be hot. I plan to give mine to someone who's old and deaf so it can annoy their neglectful children when they visit."
1,"Should be no stars, thanks anyway","After one week, this charmer began turning off as it oscillated to the left, then turning back on as it moved to the right. I'm not making this up. After two weeks, it oscillated to the left and gave up the ghost. Get something else."
2,Cannot disassemble,"Key bit of information here is that the fan cannot be taken apart for cleaning. Your fan blades will get dirty and inefficient over time and you will have no choice but to toss this in the garbage. We have a thread that somehow wrapped itself around the shaft. Can't do anything about it or the serious dust collected on the blades... The engineer who designed this should be drawn and quartered. Or perhaps it's another fine example of planned obsolescence, only they unwittingly designed the product to die too soon. Big fail.Does it blow well for the first several months? Sure. And it's loud too, which is useful for our application -- a sleeping fan for the kids. Makes for a good white noise machine.We'll definitely go elsewhere for a replacement."
1,Broke after continuous use in one week!,"We liked the fan's ability to really get the air moving and the 3 speeds were nice. After buying it from a local department store, we positioned it above the top shelf of a large book case and plenty of room to oscillate the complete 90 degree swing. We were pleased instantly, particularly with it's performance throughout the night. Strangely, it would develop repeating strange noises. Finally, the switch that locked it into a specific position, disabling the oscillation, became loose and would work itself into the locked position with each swing. We were very disappointed. We expected more from a Blizzard - we've owned a smaller unit with no difficulty with switches - about 10 years."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS TOY!!!!!,"Like most people, I thought, ""Wow! Looks like a great toy."" Wrong! I found this at a thrift store for $15.00 and in my opinion, it was $15.00 wasted. It doesn't really bounce, doesn't swivel, and sits in my backyard collecting bird droppings. I called Little Tikes to tell them how bad this toy is and the customer service lady said that noone ever complains about it, which I find hard to believe. She said that it is suppose to be a strength building toy. Now, I ask of anyone out there who bought this toy, did you buy it to build your child's strength or because you thought they'd have fun on it? She also said to try cooking oil on the base to help it swivel. I have a better idea. I'll save my cooking oil and throw this ""toy"" in the trash. Ugggh!!!"
4,Good for physical movement/sensory stimulation for toddlers,"We were looking for toys that helped with sensory stimulation (bouncing, jumping, using deep muscle tissues, etc.) for our active 2 yr old. This seems to help with that. Our only issue with the item is that the hole to fill the base with sand is VERY tiny and therefore took us over two hours to fill it with sand (that's after we had to spread and dry the sand in the sun so it slid (using a funnel) into the hole easier than wet sand). Little Tikes: the hole needs to be a LOT bigger. Also, because it's so heavy, it's very difficult to move indoor & outdoor with any frequency."
3,Not durable,"We Bought this toy for our 3 year olds birthday, It Broke in one day and she didn't even bounce on it. Also it wasn't much fun when she did. The teeter twirl is much more fun, and more durable."
2,Chinese Sand Torture,What an incredible pain in the butt it is to fill with sand. I think this should be the new interrogational technique at Gitmo for the suspected terrorists. How aburb is it that they say not to get sand in the spin section of the thing. 90lbs. of sand into a dime size hole=Excedrin Headache. My daughter seems to like it but for how long ant at what cost? A big swing and a miss for the Little Tykes Company for not regognizing a HUGE design flaw.
1,BIG DISAPPOINTMENT,"We bought this for our daughter's 2nd birthday. We were so excited because we thought she would really have fun on it. It was supposed to be like a merry go round, a teeter totter, and a bouncy ball all in one. (I had not seen the bad reviews yet.) Well, it's none of those things. It is ,however, an obstacle to mow around in the back yard. My daughter will be 4 this year and still has never been able to get it to do anything. The ball has deflated some so her feet touch the ground but it isn't bouncy enough to actually have fun bouncing it. My soon to be 2 year old can't even begin to ride it. I just want rid of the thing! Anyone interested in purchasing a slightly used Whirlybounce?"
1,Terrible Investment!,"I bought this for my 2 yr old daughter last summer, and she can't even use it. She is tiny and can't get it to spin. Just sits in the back yard fading. Very hard to fill the sand without it getting into the spinning mechanism. Don't waste your money on this item."
3,Need 90 lbs of sand for safe use,"I purchased this toy for my boys(ages 5 and 2). When I opened the box and read the directions, I discovered that it needed 90 lbs. of sand to make the toy suitable for safe use. I had intended to use it as an indoor winter toy and then move it outside for the summer, but with the amount of sand that was required, I decided to return the toy. If you have a place that you can leave it set-up, it could be a lot of fun."
3,I'm disappointed in this toy,"I've always loved Little Tikes toys and have been happy with everything I've bought of this brand of toys for my daughter except this one. She does not go high enough to satisfy her, and she is 2 1/2. She got this for Christmas when we got a hole in the Jump-O-Lene and sent it back! We were looking for something to replace that. I thought she could jump high and maybe sway from side to side at the same time, but she can't seem to do that yet. I don't know if she will be able to in the future but her 3 year old cousin can't seem to do both at the same time either and he gets bored with it real fast too. We wasted our money.UPDATE: Now she is 4, and we did away with this. None of her friends liked it because it just did not bounce enough, or high enough for them. They did not find it fun at all. It just does not work quite the way it ""seems"" to. It is misleading."
2,WhirlBounce Rider,"My mother bought this for my son for his birthday last year. We just set it up on his birthday this year. We waited so long due to the ""sand issue"" 90 lbs of sand is a lot of sand. Putting it together was no big deal, but getting the sand in that little hole was a big deal. First we bought sand that was too wet. My son and his friend were dying to get on this thing, so I had to go back out and get 90 lbs of dry sand. Also, it tells you not to get sand in the spinning part, which is impossible because the hole for the sand is 2 inches from the spinning part.Not very happy at all. And it was expensive. By the way, when it was finally ready to ride, the kids were on it like 2 minutes and were bored."
1,Shane's Mom,I agree with the other reviewers...I thought this toy would be great for my son to play with outdoors. WRONG! The ball doesn't even get close to the ground for it to bounce. My son has no interest in it...money wasted!
1,Please do not buy this toy,"I bought this toy as a Christmas gift for my Daughter she was 4, and she never plays with it. first it was a pain to pour the sand in, than to inflate the ball was a nightmare and finally when it is all done, it does not bounce as expected. this toy is sitting in my playground getting rain and ants. good for the trash."
2,Not What I Expected,"My daughter who is 4,wanted a seasaw for Christmas last year.Since she is an only child I thought that this would be a cool alternative.I was wrong!I can't complain about the time it takes to pour the sand because you only have to do this once,however I do agree w/the other reviews about the age/size.I would guess 40 pound to be approperate.It dosen't swivel very well(because the sand gets in the base) also I have this toy outside and it is very prone to collecting ants!!!Had I read the other reviews I would not have bought this."
2,Waste of Money,"I purchased this toy after reading POSITIVE reviews on it. Now I see some of the reviews make more sense.We got this for my Daughter when she was 2 thinking it was a nice addition to her outdoor toys.She tried it a couple of times and never got on it again. First of all at 2 years old, they cannot reach the ground, let alone propel the thing in a circular motion.Second of all you are supposed to grease the center so it spins. after a while, that just wears out and prevents it to turn smoothly.This sat next to our swing set for almost 2 years and we finally took it off the grass to throw it out.The bees liked it, they built a nest in the little space underneath."
1,buy a bouncy ball with handle instead,"This item was a huge disappointment! Our daughter loves to jump, and I thought this item would bounce and go around smooth and fun. Boy was I wrong. It bounces up once and really will not turn, even with spraying cooking oil on it (suggested). Sand gets all in the turning area.What a waste of $60.00 and time.We finally needed the wasted space in the play area, so we wanted to remove this toy with all the sand in the base, but we couldn't get the wet sand to come out. We had to cut into the plastic base in order to remove the sand to throw this item in the trash. I was hoping Toys R Us knew by now what kind of toy this was and would take it off it's shelf."
2,BIG DISAPPOINTMENT,"I felt so bad after I encouraged Grandma to buy this toy for our daughter. It just sits there and never gets used. It just takes up a whole lot of space. And never mind moving it, because the base needs to be filled with sand. About 100 lbs. worth."
1,Save your money,"I too purchased this toy for my son when he was around 3. Being in the 90%tile since he was 6 months of age, I thought for sure the toy was would be a perfect fit for him. Not so. As everyone else stated, funneling the sand is tedious...but fits right along with the general set-up of the toy. There is no way to keep sand out fo the swivel area and it's impossible to clean. We got a little bouncing but not much else.I was surprised to read that Little Tikes stated that they never receive complaints on the item (I had called them once, my self, prior to returning the whirlybounce to the store). It is a great idea but they should add some sort of metal hardware to the whirly portion...and make it easier to clean...and easier to bounce...and..... ;0)"
3,ugh - - - ohh gosh - - -,"I bought this for my 2yo son, before reading the reviews. But after reading the reviews, I have decided to return the item without even trying it. I thought it could be a wonderful toy for my only child, but I guess not. PLUS THE LADY WHO WROTE THAT THE BEES REALLY LIKE IT AND BUILT A NEST ON IT...I THINK IS REALLY FUNNY... GOOD LUCK GUYS AND GALS..."
3,Not What it Seems,"We got this toy second hand and it was in good condition. But it was just not a good toy. Even with water and sand, this thing will still tip over. My son weighs 40 pounds and it would tip. And it is way too hard to go around and around. Going up and down is fine, but a good old trampoline or bounce house is better. Don't waste your money!"
3,Just okay!,I bought this for my grandchildren. It was too much for them as they are only 4. It may be okay for older children over the age of 6 who are tall enough to get a good bounce!
3,From the Ultimate Rollins fan,"I do enjoy Henry's prose and journal work much more than his poetry. However, there was a bit too much self pity in this one. It was not as stong an effort as his past couple of books.Sorry Mate.PS I would still buy it for the high spots."
1,"Blah, Blah, Blah, I got it soooo bad!","The only good thing about this book is the celebrity bashing. The rest is all pissing and moaning about how bad Henry Rollins day-to-day life is. Whatever! I wish I could travel around the world and play it off like I'm some anti-establishment hero. Go do some more GAP commercials, come out of the closet, and quit putting out terrible records!"
3,Deadly Sanctuary Deadly boring,"So, i give this book 3 stars because the ending was good. Leading up to it, i was pretty bored. Nothing really happens except the main character dating two guys. Yea, real interesting. It was a free download so i finished reading it. Would i pay 8 bucks for it, no."
4,Enjoyable read,"Fast paced book with likeable/interesting characters. Since I'm from AZ it was fun to find a story based in my state, and I like books that do a good job of making you see and feel the environment they are set in."
4,Thank you for free reads!,"I may have never read any of Sylvia's books if she had not offered this one free for kindle last month. But once I read it, I had to read the others. I enjoyed them all so much. Mystery whodunits that just don't slow down. And the fact that I got so aggravated with Kendall, just proves what Sylvia can do with words. She also makes me want to move to Arizona. Read these books. She has shocking endings to them all."
1,Christian?,"The only thing Christian about this book is that all of the cursing in the book is ""Jesus"", ""Jesus Christ"", ""Jesus H Christ"" and ""Holy Mother of God"". The anti-Christian slant seemed very obvious."
3,You'll Definitely Guess the Ending,"I read this book based on the stellar reviews, a few that promised I would never guess who did it. I knew who the villains were the first time their characters were introduced, so either I'm the Einstein of literary mysteries or the author left little room for doubt. I'm going with the latter. That being said, if you can overlook the syntax of this book, it's not bad, it's just not great or befitting a five star rating, in my opinion."
4,Quick read,"This was a good, quick read. There were some loose ends left at the end, but overall it was a decent mystery. I would read other titles by this author."
4,"Fun, but flawed","It was fast, fun, light reading. I found some flaws in some of the details; particularly the use of ""y'all"" as a singular pronoun. I don't know about in Arizona, but in the South, it's always used as a plural. This is the first I've read from this author, but it was enjoyable enough to try again."
4,deadly sanctuary,having moved away from az yrs ago her descriptions were vivid and accurate. the story kept me guessing and i didnt put it down. thank you
5,A thrilling page turner,"Sylvia Nobel is a new find for me and I was thrilled by this book, which I read on the PC Kindle application. This book is a page turner I read overnight. I plan to buy more of her books. This says a lot since I am a Dean Koontz fanatic. By the way, if you are wondering why this copy of ""Deadly Sanctuary"" is free, it is because there is a technical defect in this Kindle edition, namely that several pages were inadvertently repeated. But there is nothing missing, and a little extra of a very good thing is still a very good thing."
5,A quick read with many little twistss,I enjoyed this book. I read through it in a day and enjoyed every second of it. I could see this being a movie. Maybe a Lifetime movie but still a moive. It was a perfect read for my new kindle. I'll look for more books by both of the authors.
5,A fast-paced mystery-romance with interesting characters.,"The main character, Kendall O'Dell, is someone everyone can relate to as she tries to untangle a murder mystery in her new hometown. She's attracted to two very different men--which one will win her favor? Loved the Arizona setting--very descriptive."
1,Shouldn't have read this one,"I think that the target audience for this novel is teenage girls, which I didn't realized when I bought it. If you're a man, you probably won't like this one."
1,Damon W. - TX,Jesus Christ is a sacred name to those of us who know Him. Not an expletive for cheap novels. I refuse to read the rest of the book.
4,A good read,"Kendall O'Dell makes her appearance in this first novel. She arrives in a small Arizona town, to help out on a with a failing newspaper. She makes the usual social faux-pax as she gets to know the locals, but gradually gets to know the town. Meanwhile, she is caught up in a bigger mystery of smuggled teenage girls and baby farming, putting her life at risk and bringing her closer to love.The plot is a bit far fetched and the characters somewhat overdone. But that doesn't stop it being an enjoyable read."
2,Ya'll is not singular!,"The book was an average read, however, the author's use of dialect writing was quite distracting. She must not have researched area dialects as thoroughly as needed, for she consistently had a character use the plural contraction for you all (ya'll) in a singular context."
3,Reads like a Nancy Drew novel,Meh.None of the characters appealed to me. I thought they were fairly stilted and unbelievable.The plot twist was interesting. I didn't see that coming.First half of the book took 10 months for me to complete. I charged through the second half just because I wanted to be done with it.I won't bother reading the rest of the series.
3,Good read....but with issues,"I really enjoyed this mystery book and am delighted to find that it's a series and I can keep reading. I'd like to see what pot Kendall stirs up next. The reason for the three stars? The character Ginger. I'm from Texas and NO ONE speaks like that. That dialect for this character was so far over the top that I began to loathe her halfway through the story. ""Y'all"" in every sentence? Really? Y'all is short for ""you all"". Perhaps this author doesn't know that. But instead of saying ""you""...i.e ""are you coming to dinner?"" the character says ""are y'all coming to dinner?"" Um....I'm not sure that the main character ever had a mouse in her pocket...she is only ONE person. Quite annoying. And it may stop me from even considering the other stories....."
5,Great book!,"Living in the Southwest and being a horse owner, I appreciated all the correct references to ranch life and the region. What a wonderful read! I couldn't wait to finish the book and the plot was perfectly written! Definitely a must-read!"
3,Deadly Sanctuary,"I love the story line, really into the characters.....then the book blips out. Tried reloading it, tried on the actual Kindle Fire rather than my iPad....still blips out at the same place. Skipped that place and got to read a bit more, then it blipped out again.Good read up until the technical difficulties. Hope it is fixed soon. I think it is section 2258? somewhere around there."
5,good read,Kept my interest all the way through the book. Good writing and nice story line. would read it over again.
1,Sorry to say,"Of course I wanted to like this novel. I want to enjoy any of them that I download, but each morning I couldn't remember what the story was about, and to write this review, I couldn't tell you what it is about.It is a very wordy book, and very slow moving. I gave up at chapter 14.I tried to get through it as I hate to give up on a book, but decided that my time was worth more, and I have lots of other books waiting for me to read."
2,Author Needed to do More Research,"The inaccuracies in this book are appalling. Just because Arizona is in the southern part of the United States does not mean it's the South. While expressions such as y'all aren't uncommon in Arizona, other parts of the dialogue in this book seem ripped straight out of the Southeastern US. Cattywampus? That's something I've heard in Mississippi, but never west of the river. Other descriptive elements the author added for southwestern flavor also fell flat. Unfortunately, it sounds like a book about Arizona written by (and for) snowbirds.I'd have given this book 1 star but I enjoyed the plot. It's a shame the author didn't suspend her southern stereotypes long enough to get a proper feel for the state."
2,I can't believe I read the whole thing.,"After being locked in basement storage room of a mental institution the young newspaper reporter words were, ""oh, no."" Come on, this was the worst writing using a fairly good, though somewhat predictable, plot. The characters were stereotypical, but the location was very intriquing. I am compulsive about finishing books but this on tried my need to finish. Thank goodness this was cheap on the Kindle Store. Best Seller, really?"
2,Good Effort but Disappointing,"I found this novel to be predictable and disappointing. Basically, I think it was a good attempt at writing an interesting read but it fell flat with character and plot development. The repetitive ""damsel in distress"" scenario did get rather tiring.Overall, I kept thinking it was a slightly more adult version of the Hardy Boys or Nancy Drew. These are good models upon which to write but not for an adult audience. I did not realize this was part of a series (as another review said was the case) and this is a compliment to the stand alone nature of this installment. However, I won't be reading the others in the series."
2,Boobs and Buns,"This novel is obviously written for those who are interested in a quick, easy read... short sentences, silly dialogue (boobs and buns??) inane characters and an insipid, vapid plot. I got to page 55 and quit."
4,Deadly Sanctuary,"Good charactors, accurate depiction of the Arizona setting. I enjoyed it very much as a 27 year resident of Arizona."
2,Predicatable,"Although the book was quite readable, I found it ridiculously easy to predict the ""mystery"". Also, I prefer a bit less emphasis on romantic involvements and more on the actual mystery."
4,Great book,"I really enjoyed this book. It had a great storyline, and was just a really fun read. Couldn't get the image of Sam Elliot as Tally out of my head... somehow it made it even more fun to read."
3,Good story..bad writing!,I liked this book. I almost didn't finish reading it though.It was hard to really get into it when the sentences didn't flow. That said around the middle it got better and I finished it in one sitting. Worth the read for the price!
4,Cute mystery,"I found Deadly Sanctuary to be an enjoyable read. Nothing heavy, but it engaged me enough to finish it, and to place the other three novels in the series on my Kindle wishlist, I'm sure I will get to them in time.Just a note, a couple of other reviewers referred to problems with chapter 19 in the Kindle version. The file I downloaded in December suffered from those problems, but they are fixed in the file I downloaded from here today."
5,Fun Read!,"This was my first download on my Kindle, sorry to see it has been removed from the Free Kindle list.I am a J. Patterson, S. Woods, M. Connelly fan so thought I'd give this a try and I was NOT disappointed.It was a fun read and jaw dropping ending that I did not see coming.I recommended this book to several friends who were disappointed they could not find it anywhere free or otherwise on the Kindle list anymore.Great ""take me away from the stress of the day"" read for sure."
5,Halls,"Was glad to find a place to order these, can not find them in stores around where I live. Recieved in a timely fashion."
2,"Graphics look nice, but maps are a problem","You can't beat the price for this very colorful atlas with lots of pictures and graphs that kids will like, but it has a major flaw in that almost every map is split by the tight binding. Information is lost by being buried in the gutterless pages, which makes the maps almost usless. Hopefully, future Scholastic (and other publishers') atlases will be designed with a map on one page and the graphs, pictures and info on the other. We had high hopes for acquiring such a reasonably priced atlas for our library patrons to use, and were very disappointed. It's a shame to waste such nice resources on poor layout."
4,"Aside from the map issue, a mediocre student atlas","I chose this atlas out of a selection at Borders, for my middle-school-age child. We had purchased the Rand McNally ""intermediate"" atlas, which was supposedly for ages 9 and up, but it was too simplistic. This atlas provides a lot more information for the money. The maps definitely have an issue; too much is lost in the binding area. Aside from that, this seems to be a nice student atlas for basic project work -- by basic, I mean it is geared more towards continents and regions. If you want information about specific countries, which seems to me an obvious thing for an atlas to have, you will need to look elsewhere. Too bad!!"
5,cover for pool,does exactly what I need covers the pool so my 3 year old wont throw any thing unwanted in it.
4,Pool cover,"Ordered this cover for our recently purchased pool for the grandkids. Cover did the job - it covered the pool. Cover seems a little larger than necessary, sinks into the pool a little & gets covered with water so algae on top is a problem, but we can live with it. Seems sturdy and is easy to put on even by one person. Price was good, item arrived promptly. Satisfied with purchase."
1,Holes ???,"The other reviews would have been helpful if I had seen them. The picture nor description show that the new product has several small holes and one big hole (with screen)in the center. I had a previous cover (without) holes that worked great. I presume the holes in the new version are to prevent drownings, but no explaination is given. The new version tends to sink, allows water to evaporate, and allows dirt to get into the pool. It is better than nothing, but I prefer the old version. My reaction may have been different if they had bothered to change picture and / or desfription."
5,Great Cover,"Fits perfectly, even on different brand pool. The rope is already threaded through the cover so it's easy to pull over and tie tightly. The material has been quite durable so far and the cover is holding up very well overall. Great price too!"
3,holes in it?!?,"very strange, there are manufacturers holes all over this product. I don't get it, what is the point in a cover if its just going to have quarter sizes holes all over it?!"
4,pool cover,"I bought this pool cover as my pool did not come with one, it does a good job of keeping debris out of the pool."
2,Wish I could return it.,"The size of the holes in top lets EVERYTING in. Also the string to hold the cover on has to be tied, it is not a draw string, which makes it difficult to get tight. Heavy wind blew it off."
3,Pool Cover,"It fit the pool, however it tore at the seam shortly after we got it. I used it through the season and will look for a diffrent solution next year."
1,Not very impressed,"The 10' x 10' cover is made of sturdy materials and appeared to be well made. However, when using it to cover my 10' x 10' pool, I found that it was much too large and that it laid in the water instead of stretching across the top. Attempts at using the drawstrings to tighten the cover across the pool were in vain, and actually resulted in the cover splitting where the crawstrings come out. Great design, good material, just entirely too big for my size pool. I'd imagine it would work well with the 12'x 12' model."
3,not what we expected,"When we ordered this, we expected it to fit like it shows in the photo. Ours seems way too big and actually lays on the water with more room to spare. I also didn't expect there to be holes in the cover. These are not accidental holes, but manufactured ones. The holes allow bugs and things to still get into the pool. All in all, the cover keeps most of the bugs and debris out and is easy to put on since it is oversized."
4,Great fun and very entertaining!,"I bought this pool to entertain a six and eight year old. It really did the trick. It was fairly easy to set up. I wish I had put level sand under it though. The ring needs aIring up about every other day, but it is easy to do. I understand all the water will spill out if it deflates. But it was perfect for the age grandchildren I have. It comes about to the thighs of the six year old and knees of the eight year old. They aren't afraid of the water, so they could swim with minimum supervision but not alone. It is 12' across, so it was great for adult floating as well. I love this pool and highly recommend it for this age child. I bought a cheap pool cover, but it was impossible for one person to put it on. I then bought the one made by Intex. It worked great!Sorry, but I thought at first I was reviewing the pool instead of the cover. I just hated to waste the info."
4,Does What It Is Meant to do,"This pool cover keeps our pool really clean and has strings to tighten it's grip on the pool. We were gone for one weekend and the cover blew off in a storm, but since then we've tied it tighter and it's worked very well."
1,Disappointed,"We have purchased other pool covers in the past that have been more effective at keeping rain water and tree debris out of the pool. Unfortunately, the description did NOT include DEBRIS COVER - or state that there were small drain holes. We have had to do more pool cleaning and treating since using this cover because of the debris that had gotten through the holes. When taking the cover off, the water comes back through to the top which makes it heavier to pull and actually sinks rather than floating on top. Very disappointed.Intex Easy Set 15-Foot Pool Cover"
2,Better than no cover but not by much...,"As other reviewers have stated, there are ""drain holes"" in the cover. They're pretty large in my opinion (about quarter sized, give or take) and do allow quite a lot of dirt/insects into the pool despite the cover being on. This could possibly be remedied if the holes were all mesh covered, however, on the one I bought (10' size) *none* of the holes have mesh. The 12' cover seems to have one larger drain hole in the center that is covered with mesh vs the dozen or so completely open holes that the 10' cover has scattered around the top. If I could find the box for it, I would probably return it and try the 12' cover, since the 10' is pretty large on the 10'x30"" pool anyway."
5,PERFECT!!!,"LOVE IT!!! fits perfect, has a little nylon string already attached that you can tighten to hold it down. Just as I expected and exactly what I wanted :D"
3,It works,"Covers the pool, keeps the big stuff out and some of the small stuff. Didn't have a cover before so i was constantly cleaning. With the cover I have to clean alot less and can actually enjoy the pool alot more."
1,Didn't Fit,I have a 15 foot Easy Set pool and this cover was way too small. It was at least a foot and a half too short to get across the pool.
1,Just walk away from this...,"This piece of Chinese dung has holes in it!!! Worthless. Run away from this one, folks. My first single star having made dozens of purchases via Amazon."
1,poor design,"We were looking for a cover that keeps debris out of the pool, guess what, this cover does not do this. I had more debris in the pool than without a cover. The holes should not be there in the first place, it accumulated more water on the top than when I had a tarp over the top of the pool and it did not keep dandelions, weeds or leaves out of the pool, so I would say this was a total waste of time and money. I have returned the item and unless the design is fixed, I will not be buying another pool cover from Intex.."
3,Ok so so,Works but rips easly... too many holes in the center cause it to sink into the pool.. putting inflatables under it helps.. okay because it's cheap
3,Drainage holes are less that ideal,"I purchased this product and did not notice that the photo and description noted ""drainage holes"" in the cover. These covers are designed for small pools - not pools that have vacuuming capability. The drainage holes allow debris to drain into the pool and get the pool dirty. I would recommend that you look for a cover WITHOUT drainage holes to keep your pool clean."
2,Not the greatest,"It worked perfectly well for about the first week and then it tore when we were trying to tighten it around the pool. After that, there was no way to secure it. It would blow off or into the pool with the tinest amount of wind. Unfortunately, it was pretty much a waste of money."
2,Needs some adjustments,"Shipping was great, arrived on time...Why put small circular holes all over it...Doesn't show these in the photo.Bought it to keep the neighbors tree leaves out...The holes let them in....Cover also does not stay tight around the top..even when putting a double bow in the strings to try to keep it snug.It became a lawn mover cover...."
2,"Stretches over time, seam across middle separating","In just a few months the Intex Easy Set 10-Foot Round Pool Cover stretched out of shape. It still protected the pool for the most part, but allowed the cover to flap in the wind. Overtime, the stretching caused the cover to sink below the water in the middle allowing debris to mix with the water. The cover would slip out from under the debris (like leaves) when removing. Finally, the seam across the middle began separating. I contacted the seller, but was told their was no warranty. I can't recommend it for more than 1 summer (2 to 3 month before separating). We finished out the summer even with the separation, but used a great deal of care to keep it from progressing. Blue duct tape?? It's probably not a bad deal if you can get free shipping."
4,It works,"Unfortunately, it ripped and didn't quite make the whole summer. However, it did a great job of keeping leaves out of the pool."
3,lasted a while before getting punctured,"Still a good value, but carefullt protect it from damage. Probably should have kept my cats away from it !"
4,Works fine,"This cover works fine. All the people complaining about the holes concerned me, but I just put a beach ball or some flotation device in the middle of the pool when this cover goes on and it keeps the water from pooling on top."
3,"DOES NOT FIT INTEX 15' x42""","Looked at the pics, description read fits all Intex pools, Does not fit mine. 15'x42"" but works great as an overhang. Thanks alot"
4,Good Cover,"I bought two of these at the beginning of the summer because every other summer the cover has torn and needed replacement. Well, 2/3 of the way through, the first cover is still doing great. My only complaint is the holes. I assume these are to let rain in but it doesn't rain here in the summer and the cover sinks into the water. when this happens all the dust and leaves just get into the water anyway. I put a float under the cover to keep it from sinking under the water. That is mostly solving the problem."
2,Not size it says,We ordered it especially for our 8way ft. pool and ut was so big on it. It hung over the sides and almost to the ground. Wind got undet it and flew it right off!
3,Overall good cover but...,"I purchased this cover because I wanted to keep my Intex East Set pool clean. However I noticed two things, 1. The drawstring that goes around the cover to make sure is stays in place began to rip through the cover so now I have to be careful that this does not continue because it will end up damaging the cover all around. 2. The cover has some holes in the center which I am not sure what they are there for, BUT dust and leaves do manage to get in thus when I take the cover off I notice that the bottom of the pool has dirt and there are leaves floating on the water.In summary, the material needs to be a little more resistant and I would reconsider having holes in the middle of the pool, because really, dirt will get through."
3,okay,I bought this for a spa cover to keep the leaves out and acorns. It fits ok but it started to sag in the middle. so now when it sags leaves pile up in the middle and we have to take it off clean it and put it back on again about every 2 weeks. this is what I was trying to avoid. I guess its better than cleaning the spa every week.
2,Intex Easy 12-Foot Round Pool Cover,Pool cover made out of thin material and did not stay on pool. While trying to put cover over pool it tore.
1,Pool cover?,"I've used this pool cover for almost a year, and i have ben nothing but happy with it. It seems to be very strong, and have not had a problem with it."
3,The Drawstring Broke,The cover itself is holding up really well but the drawstring that holds the cover onto the pool broke after about one month of use. I easily replaced it some chord from ACO that is impervious to pool chemicals. It's a shame that they couldn't use a quality drawstring to begin with. If you don't mind the hassle of having to repair something that should not have broken in the first place then I guess this is the cover for you.
5,Pool Cover,"We have 3 grandkids ages 3,5 and 5 1/2. They visit us during the summer for a week.The cover saves us from needing to empty the pool daily and keeps debris out.It's made of a sturdy vinyl gauge and is very easy to maintain. Just rinse."
2,"Cheap, almost disposable, but wont last very long","This pool is super easy to install and very cheap. Unfortunately, the vulnerability of the inflatable circular ring which holds up the sides of the pool to punctures and leaks makes this item a less than ideal buy. I have gone through several of these pools in the past 3 years before deciding to purchase the Intex metal framed model which seems to be much more durable. In addition, the filter pump that comes with this pool is junk. It never lasts more than a month before it stops working. I ended up purchasing a higher quality pump which has been operating for over 2 years without any problems."
3,Pool cover does an OK job.,"The cover doesn't stretch as tightly across as it does in the product picture, and it is a grayish-blue color. It actually lays on top of the water, and also has holes in it. I feel like the pool gets just as dirty if I don't use it because bugs can still get in, but at least it keeps out leaves and helps in case a cat or squirrel decides to jump on it. I'm not sure if it helps to warm the pool water, but my pool is placed in an area that gets a lot of shade. Overall I am glad I have it. I keep my floats in the pool with the cover over it."
2,"Fits, but...","This fits and its of decent quality. However, it has holes in it for whatever reason and so there is constantly water on the top and then god forbid a bird shits on it or there is a storm and debris collects on it. Now you have a disgusting mix of crap in your pool. If I had to do it again, I'd opt for one without HOLES ON IT. That is just silly."
3,a bit strange to use,"great idea (wrap it around the pool ledge), but in practice proved too flimsy in the middle, did not go around the pool edge and would not tie in place. it also has holes (which is great for water not gathering on it an for keeping the pool water a little fresher, however, it then lets dirt and rain into the pool. I wish it was much more sturdier and easy to put on, take off and maintain."
1,too small,i bought the pool set and the cover and it has just been impossible to close it by myself - the cover is too small and that makes it totally useless.
5,Exactly right,This is exactly what it said it was. Shipped quickly and is durable and easy to put on and off for one person.
3,10 foot round pool cover,"The pool cover fits well over the round air filled top, it does sag in the middle as it lays on the water, which does collect some dust and leaves. However it does help keep the water much cleaner. I DO RECOMMEND THIS COVER. I would buy again if I need another cover. Try it you will like it!!!!!!!!!!"
5,GREAT,THE COVER IS GREAT!! SAVE ME A LOT TOF TIME AND EFFORT KEEPING THE POOL CLEAN. THE COVER IS VERY STURDY!! I LOVE IT.
1,Not good,"I purchased the cover thinking it would work great with my round pool so i could keep the leaves and dust out fo the water which in term would save me from having to change the water all the time. What a waste of money, withing the week it got ripped where you tied it. Then it rained and it sagged bringing leaves and dirt into the pool. NOT A GOOD BUY AT ALL !!!"
2,May not last the season,I like the holes in the top because it makes removing easy. My problem is after less than a week the seam that holds the pull tie started coming apart. It's basically a tarp since you can't really get it tight. Next year I will spend more for a better product.
3,Still a bit big for the pool,"I did have a much bigger cover for the 8x30, I ordered this one and it's still big for this pool. I didn't know that it had holes on the top, it still let's things get into the pool, I'm not happy with that."
4,Intex Easy Set 8-Foot Pool Cover,The cover works well in the beginning but then it caves in the middle as it gets used more often.
2,12 Foot Intex Pool Cover,"First time placing the pool cover on, pulling on the string to tie and secure, the insert section for the rope string was torn first thing.Disappointed in that had understood the cover to be secured by an elastic edge (from various reviews, commentary) but it was really rope string that had to be pulled tightly to secure. Our pool was a bit unlevel (but not terribly) and this may have contributed to the problem but definitely needed 2-3 people to try and get it on. Really unhappy that it would tear so easily and can't imagine having to put this cover on the pool on a daily basis. We left it off after this and don't imagine we'll get much use out of it due to lack of ease as well as the damage that already exists from the very first time. Too bad since we've enjoyed the actual pool purchase."
2,Designed for Intex pools only,"I purchased this cover thinking it would be the perfect size for my eight foot wide circular wading pool. However, clearly the cover was too small. I can only think that maybe the Intex eight foot pools are not really eight feet wide at the top. Had it fit, though, it would have been ideal for my purposes."
1,Don't bother,"Picture is VERY misleading. It is not blue, but more of an army grey color. It is not stiff, but more like a car cover. Once the cover is one, which is difficult by oneself, it ties. It you don't tie it tight enough, and there is a strong wind, it will blow away. Also, there is no way to get it as taught as in the picture. There are about 10 holes around the center which allows a lot of debris in. This is not anything like the picture at all."
4,A Must for the Easy Set Pool,"This is a must if you get the Easy Set Pool. This helps keep the pool so much cleaner, which makes it much easier to control the chemicals balance on."
2,"wasnt very sturdy, ripped with first time useage, and doesnt fit well like should in photo","This cover wasnt very sturdy! The first time I put it on and pulled the darw string, the plastic ripped! It doesnt fit as well as the photo shows it therefore is not keeping the leaves ect. out of the pool. My rating would be a 2 stars."
2,Keeps out the UV rays,"This pool cover has about 6 or so large holes in it - 5"" diameter. I'm not sure why. But because of that, some water from the pool ends up on top of the cover and when you take the cover off, any dirt the cover kept out flows right into the pool through the holes. So I assume this cover is just to keep the UV rays of the sun from burning off your chlorine. It does a good job of that, but it literally is useless for keeping dirt out. Unless I'm using it wrong."
5,Intex pool cover,"It does what it is meant to do -- cover a the pool. It has faded a little in the sun and does not fit tightly as shown in the picture, but seems durable and has stayed on the pool during high winds (60 mph)."
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!,"I have a very nice carved slate table and I wanted a clear cover to use, so the table itself could be seen underneath. Don't waste your time on these cheap covers. I figured for only $8 I would try it and see, but it is not a cover at all. It is more like a large piece of clear raincoat you see tourists wearing. It is completely flat with no corners shaped for the table, so the edges just drape over the sides and pockets. The tip of each ""corner"" has what looks like a coin about the size of a nickel sewn in it to weigh the edges down over the sides. I threw it in my garage to use as a rain cover instead if I ever need one. Save your time and $8, and buy one of the real table covers for $20-$30."
1,Not worth the money!,"There are holes in the cover (for ventiation I guess) and they let stuff in including water. The water eventually fills up on top of the cover & then the cover becomes to heavy to pull off without all the junk that has landed on top of the pool cover going in too. Also, by having the pool covered and the fact that the ""filtration system"" isn't too swift (to keep the water moving), algae & mildew form in the pool. So, I think I'm just going to try a small swimming pool net instead."
1,Do not buy!!!,"My cover from last year needed to be thrown out at the end of the season, so I bought this one. It actually fit, which surprised me since a lot of the reviews said their's didn't. But here it is June 12th and the darn thing is ripped along a seam already!!! I guess I'm better off buying a tarp since I'm NOT going to buy another one of these!"
1,DO NOT PURCHASE,"recommended by Toyrus to purchase with 15'x42 splasher pool package. ITEM DID NOT FIT. Toyrus will not refund or exchange, I am now stuck with item I can not use eventhough item was recommended by Toyrus."
3,Works fairly well for at least one purpose,"I bought this cover for two reasons: To keep debris out of our grandkid's small pool and to help warm it up in the early part of the season. This product definitely helps the sun warm up the water but it doesn't fit tight enough (it does have a cord to cinch it with) to keep it from sagging below the water line. As a result the water on top of the cover fills with debris and then flows into the pool when you take it off. Consequently, only about half of the debris that falls on the pool is kept out and you still have to use a net to clean. This product was very inexpensive and seems to be of some quality so I think we will have it for awhile as it does serve a positive purpose. The delivery time was extremely fast so no problem there."
4,Review of Easy Set Pool Cover,The pool cover I purchased works very well and is easy to use to cover my 10' Easy Set Pool. A drawstring is all you need to pull to make it fit snug over the pool. It keeps out debris and bugs so the water remains clear. What I am not happy about is the pool itself. The filter pump hoses are a nightmare to keep attached to the pump because they have plastic fittings that come loose. The pool ring also deflates overnight even though there are no leaks. I am constantly emptying and refilling the pool and adding chlorine each time to keep it fresh and safe. The pump is useless.
3,Little holes for what !?,"The cover has a bunch of little holes in it. So what happens is the water inside the pool will come out of these holes and sit on top of the cover. Dust and dirt will settle on the water. When you remove the cover, alot of the water will go back inside the holes along with the dirt, so you are putting dirst all up inside your pool.The holes don't make sense to me."
3,It does it's job,"It works, but it ripped right away were you pull it's cords tight. It also is a little large for the pool size, even though it is the same brand as the pool."
2,Pool Cover,This pool cover for the 12' Easy Set pool is flimsy compared to the cover we got with the 10' pool. It ripped at the tie the first time we used it. It was pretty cheap though so I guess I got what I paid for.
2,Bad Design!,"There are Holes in this cover so that rain water can go into the pool so you can remove the cover easily, but these holes let the pool water flood the cover and any dirt or debris can now get in the pool. The person who thought this was a bright idea was very stupid, but hey it's made in china go figure. NOW here is the fix to this problem: Go to Wal-Mart buy a pool liner patch kit and seal these holes, Problem solve for a bad design!"
2,Was ok..,"Seemed to be a very durable cover until I pulled the string to tighten it and the side ripped out.. I believe it is a good cover, just the pocket the rope is in is a little weak.. I didn't contact the seller because I really needed it and it has served its purpose, just can't keep it tight over the pool.."
4,very durable and easy to maintain,"We ended up purchasing a hot tub but before the hot tub this pool was a lot of fun. Easy to set up. I would recommend purchasing a filter system for a larger pool to ensure a very, very tidy pool. We live along conservation land, so more leaves and bugs to fall in but I also hate cleaning. We had our water tested at a local pool store and then just purchased water treatment for hot tubs. You will have plenty of supplies for a couple of seasons. Our friends have it now and are very happy. The solar blanket sold separately held in a lot of the heat so worth the purchase."
1,Very disappointing,"The picture does not show ""drain holes"", otherwise I wouldn't have purchased this. I have a 7 ft diameter pond in which I keep a fountain during the non-winter months. I purchased this cover, thinking it would be a great way to coving the pool area and keep out leaves and water. It doesn't even seem to fit my 7ft diamter pool, even though it says it will cover an 8 ft pool. The ""holes"" in the cover defeats my purpose of keeping water out during the winter months."
