4,Hans Platzgumer & Divinitées Irritées - Fingerfood,"Hans Platzgumer serves up some interesting FINGERFOOD, little bits of tech-house, liberally spiced with funk. And if ""Discofox"" could fit comfortably on the dancefloor, ""Psychokiller"" offers a more hip-hop flavored dish. ""L'Homme Machine"" is unmistakably tinged with acid, while the long and angular ""Coup de Grace"" goes down easily, with a pinch of old-skool techno in there for flavor. To close out the album, ""Smart"" goes for some downtempo trip-hop. Quite a tasty appetizer!"
5,WOW!! I can't wait to read the others!,"I bought the book form a used book sale on vacation and thought that it might be a good book to read on the plane, but as i read i found myself just bewitched by it. I couldn't put it down and since then i have read it at least 5 times."
1,Barf and Miranda's Love Story,"Oh gosh this is thee worst book I have ever read! Good thing I picked it up at a dollar store. The story started out alright but I think it was when Barf stumbled tipsily onto the scene that things went down hill. The last scene were they were in the woods was.....about as romantic as watching a dead tree rot.The L.J. Smith type cover design attracted me to it despite the giggle worthy red eyes of Garth, our ""hero"" (snort) and the way Miranda's sprawled across it like one of those cheesy 80's romance covers. And if I remember right (this book is in a deep dark place in my closet and will hopefully never be unleashed on the world again)Garth even has a mullet..and then there's the demonic blood shot red eyes staring out from the cover.)My suggestion, L.J. Smith is worlds better and I'm just glad I got this book for a dollar."
1,never received my order,"Amazon does not ensure proper delivery of ordered items. It has been almost a month since I ordered my book, and I have never received it"
1,Far to short,"This Video is much too short, it speaks about the John Lennon shooting in New York for about 10 minutes then the remaining tape is all the other news of the day."
1,Disappointing,"I had high hopes of an engineered CD that would help my newborns development. Instead I got a CD with 8-10 tracks of classical music - that's it (and the tracks aren't even labeled so that I know the composer/song). There are none of the nature sounds, verbal messages, biorhythms, or heartbeats that are promised on the cover. Just a plain classical music CD."
5,Absolutely Stunning Work,"I've never been to New York, and I've never been to a black Baptist church. But the spirit of this institution- its leaders and worshippers- absolutely radiate off the pages of this book. It is unbelievably inspiring. It would make an excellent gift for any liberal Christian activist you know, for a pastor or clergy member working hard to integrate the church into the community, or for yourself. The text is also beautifully formatted, and the history and descriptions are very accessible. The primary focus is always on the black and white photos found on almost every page. Beautiful."
4,Magically Delicious!,"There are some books that have the power to be life changing, like ""Atlas Shrugged"", ""Of Mice and Men"", or ""Green Eggs and Ham"". Rest assured, this is not one of those books. It is however, a very enjoyable mystery, far more entertaining than say, anything Mary Higgins Clark has ever written. Mr. Bohannon captures the very essence of New York through the characters, and the use of a magician as the subject and storyteller is a unique twist.I highly recommend this novel to anyone who enjoys mysteries or who might like a fast paced, breezy novel centered on some quirky characters. I certainly hope Mr. Bohannon has another novel out soon. On a personal note, I also hope Mr. Bohannon forgives me for regurgitating warm Pabst Blue Ribbons in his backyard about 20 years ago. At any rate, the book is great, so buy it, ok?"
1,Bad for gums,"After reading so many positive reviews of this toothpaste, I decided to give it a try. What a mistake! Five seconds after washing my teeth with it my gums were red, slightly swollen and extremely painful. I will never ever use this toothpaste again. I wanted to try something natural without SLES, fluorid and all that but this toothpaste proved to be a poor choice (p.s. I don't have sensitive gums, I have perfectly healthy gums!). My advice - try this product before you decide to buy it, otherwise it can turn to be an expensive mistake."
4,"non-irritating, but takes some getting used to","I have frequent mouth sores, and ordinary toothpaste burns and irritates my mouth. This toothpaste doesn't, but it is a bit odd since it tastes like licorice and doesn't foam at all. It's going to take some time to get over the mint=fresh association I've had for so long, but so far, the trade off is worth it!"
3,Outrageous shipping charges!!,"$15.00 Shipping. You can do better almost anywhere else.This is Amazon, not some high end 5th avenue shopping place."
5,Very Well Engineered Piece of Equipment,This cart is solid and very well designed. I don't think it would break in a million years. More than sufficient for normal luggage you may put on it. Very easy to open and close.
5,great for massage table when doing house calls,This cart is very sturdy & worth the money I spent. It holds my massage table very well. It a must for massage therapist. My Delivery was on time just
3,"Great research, writing only so-so","I picked up this book because of its unusual and intriguing subject matter. I figured it would be a nice diversion to read about some of the crazy adventures and mishaps that befall famous corpses after the funeral (so to speak). In that, I was not disappointed. Murphy obviously did his research, and he was honest enough to list various accounts when the facts were in doubt. He also wrote with a nicely wry sense of humor befitting the subject. However, I found the writing to lack a certain polish, as if I was reading a third draft instead of the finished product. I found enough awkward sentences, paragraphs with more than one subject, and other poorly constructed phrases to dampen my enjoyment of the book somewhat. I suspect this may not be the fault of the author so much as the editors involved in the project, but in any case, the book suffered as a result."
5,You can't always rest in peace,"This book took me a long time to read because I had to keep stopping and share stories with my friends and coworkers. Did you know that Roger Williams's corpse was eaten by an apple tree and left behind a Roger-shaped tree root? (Suspicious of that story, I asked my father, a PhD botanist, if such a thing could happen. He assured me it could.) Did you know that Dorothy Parker's ashes sat in a filing cabinet for years because no one could decide what to do with them? This is an amusing, eye-opening and not at all depressing book."
5,love Blue Man,This is awesome.Their is nothing not to love about Blue Man.They are ingenious.I can listen to this no matter my mood 24/7.
5,blue man group rock,"this is a great dvd - lots of fun and the blue man group keep you entertained. some great cover songs as well, like teenage wasteland."
4,Great DVD for your surround sound,This DVD sounds awesome on a good surround sound system. The kids loved it also.
5,Gift for my brother,Blue Man Group is just awsome. Period. I got this for my younger brother and he's played it so many times I wounder if it was such a good idea to get it...
2,Not what you would expect.,You will be disappointed if you have ever seen the Blue Man Group in person.
1,Blue Man Group,"Ok Ok Ok Now I know. Blue Man Group is a fun time if one goes to their live show. Like in LAS. If you want a really enjoyable experience with Blue Man Group, see their show live. Don't purchase this dvd. Unless of course you don't want an enjoyable experience with BMG. If you purchase this dvd you won't ever want to see them again! YO YO YO BMG forget the attempt to break into Rock-n-Roll. Nix the hired singers. Stick to what works. Comedy and Rhythm is your forte'. You are in need of a good Manager! Have Your People Call My People. We'll do brunch and put your careers (ca rears) back on track! It's Blue Man Group not Blew Man Group!"
4,Blue Man Group- Complex Tour,Nothing is better than being live at the event. You can enjoy this if you have a large screen TV and a good sound system. Even if you don't it is still a good show.
5,Blue Man Group-Complex Tour,"This is one of the best concerts on DVD that I have ever seen!! Blue Man Group is cultural, educational, and best of all, for all age groups! Loved It!"
4,Blue Man Group DVD,"I saw the Blue Man Group perform live, which was why I purchased the DVD. The DVD was a good presentation of the live show.I enjoyed watching the DVD, which refreshed my memory of the live show."
2,See them live,"I saw Blue Man Group in a small theater live and loved them. This DVD, though, I thought was a complete bore. Skip the DVD and watch them live."
1,Blue Man Group,"Blue Man Group, ""The Complex Rock Tour Live"" DVD claims to have live footage from their shows. However, THIS IS ONLY A MUSIC CD--NOT A DVD FROM ANY OF THEIR SHOWS--WHICH ARE COPYRIGHTED AND CANNOT BE SHOWN. THEY ONLY TELL YOU THIS AFTER YOU HAVE PURCHASED THE DVD AND ATTEMPT TO PLAY IT. THIS IS A RIP OFF! You will only see a few music videos and 3 or 4 three-second clips of what you would see at one of their shows. WASTE OF MONEY. Buy a different DVD"
4,great video for those who like to rock,"Well done, good pacing, I'd prefer more uptempo stuff, but overall good. I missed the new onstage live stuff...but perhaps on another video?"
3,it ok,it is better in person this was more musical and singing than the other blue man show i dont know who those people are singing but it ok
4,Definetly not as good as the real thing.,"If you've seen the Blue Man Group live then this might be a little of a let down to you. The DVD is good but it just doesn't give you the same feeling of being there in person. If you've never seen them live then the DVD will be great, but you still have to see them live. My favorite part is the song ""I Feel Love"", With Venus Hum. Mixing live vocalists with their regular music, the Blue Man Group puts on a show that is guaranteed to entertain all. I'm still waiting for something like ""The Blue Man Group-Live at the Venetian."" That was one concert well worth the $100.00"
3,"Great service, damaged product","Item was shipped and arrived well ahead of expected delivery date; however, upon opening, the container was damaged and so was the DVD inside; had to return the item to the seller; return was easy and quick, account was credited full amount of purchase and shipping; would gladly do business with them again cause it wasn't their fault for the damaged product.."
3,Blue Man DVD,"Shipment was timely and product price was reasonable, however, I don't think this is one of their better performances."
3,"Ok, not good as live show","I've seen the BMG twice in Orlando and frankly, that group makes for a far better show than this video, albeit the video is a few years old now. The Orlando group has far more audience participation and of course, the live band. The best part is that there is no mournful or unintelligible singing. The video isn't bad if you have never seen the BMG before and wonder who, what they are and what they do. For that purpose the video is quite watchable. However, if you ever have the chance to see any of the BMG performances live around the country, do so. You will have a much better time."
4,Excellent Video of Blue Men,"I read some review here and almost didn't buy this because some were disappointed that the footage is not of one of their main shows. I saw their Vegas show last summer and absolutely loved it. They obviously are not going to sell their show video to keep it exclusive (probably to make us go to the Luxor in Vegas and drop a few bills in the casino). Their Vegas show is about 50% comedy and 50% music. This DVD (Complex Tour) is about 90% music and 10% comedy. The Blue Men still have their trademark personality in this video. Noticed that Venus Hum is lip-synching. Wonder if anything else is faked? This DVD isn't very expensive and I highly recommend it if you are a fan. And yes, spring the money and go see them live. The show is a sarcasm on our high-tech generic society."
1,unusable Faceplate,I found the product unusable the threads were totally messed upAnd was unable to screw it on the lathe I sent it back for anExchange and the 2ND one was the same way must have been aBad batch from china where it was made.
1,Basically useless,"Twenty years ago I spent a lot of time working on cars and successfully relied on car manufacturers' shop manuals, Chiltons, etc. This book pales by comparison to what I relied on then. It's poorly organized, pathetically illustrated, and cryptically written -- all in all, it's basically useless. If I have the time, I'll try to return it and get my money back."
5,wondeful,"This soulful book is the best I have read in a long time(and I read a lot). Some of these stories really blew me away. Buy it , read it and don't look back!"
4,fun,"fun book, tells it how it is. good book 2 have with your lonely planet europe on a shoestring guide"
1,Teenage Angst On Tour,"I had such high hopes for this book after reading the other reviews, but it turned out to be little more than a tribute to teen angst abroad. One might expect this of teenagers but not travel writers, even the second-rate variety. Rite of Passage presents a series of backpacking vignettes told by a number of different authors, in a variety of styles and settings. The problem is, with a few exceptions, the stories are all the same: a covert hookup in a hostel, consumption of an unusual animal by-product, a mugging that common sense could have avoided, or a ""love"" that was just never meant to be. I really hope there's more to Europe than that! Rite of Passage made me want to cancel my trip."
4,my midi chuck,"although i haven't used my new chuck ,it looks like it is just the thing i need to do the kind of work i'm starting."
1,Very poor design,"I don't think the designers at Palm were awake when they designed this case. I'll have to wait for an alternative to come out, as the case that came with the Palm invites static and the leather case does not work well. I am willing to put up with a bit of difficulty to have a secure case, but this is ridiculous - we've cut our fingers, dropped the LifeDrive - it's not worth it. Save yourselves the trouble and just don't buy this."
4,PalmOne 3218WW Aluminum Hard Case for LifeDrive Mobile Manager,Neat design. Well worth the investment to get the hard case for my Lifedrive. All functions are easily accessible when in the case.Con - Opening the case is difficult.
1,dont buy-use leather instead,"i used to have a T3 and an aluminum case for that. it was perfect. when i bought my lifedrive and the hard case for it, i spent hours to solve how to open the case when my palm is in. now i see i am not the only person. so bad, i dont know what to do with it now. the leather case coming with the Lifedrive is quite nice and useful. no need to buy anything else."
1,One word...Don't buy it!!!,My first disappointment with Palm product. I am loyal Palm customer. I am hugely disappointed with the Hard case because as said it is almost impossible to open it. Secondly not worth to buy it.One word...Don't waste your money..Not even one star!
2,Nail Killer.,"the case is very attractive since it's made out of alumminun and rubber, but......... to open the case is were the nighmare comes true, technically it will ripp your nail off."
5,Perfect Protection for the LifeDrive,"This case works great to protect my LifeDrive. I have dropped it a few times, and it cushions the impact and has kept my LifeDrive running. Granted, it is bulky, but the LifeDrive is bulky, so there's really no way around that. It fits nicely in my pocket and is easy to open when I want to use the LifeDrive. There is a hole to get the stylus out, and this case fits the LifeDrive like a glove. Very nice accessory!"
3,Aluminum Hard Case for Life Drive.,"Although serving its purpose as a protective case, It makes the already bulky Life Drive that much more so. The side hinge is engineered about as good as your standard porch door. The clasp is sometimes hard to open and doesn't seem to close securely."
2,Not so hot...,"While this case does protect my new lifedrive well, it unfortunately is extremely hard to open each time I want to use it! This attribute makes it extremely annoying to use. So, it might just be easier to buy a case from another manugfacturer, or use one of the leather casings, which I am sure would work just fine."
1,Case of too small for my PDA,"I purchased this item for my PALM PDA. What a waste of money. My Palm Tungsten would not fit. Probably my fault for throwing away the packaging before actually trying it out. I bought a new tungsten and the case, but the case arrived first. I opened the package and tossed the container. After all, both items I bought were from Palm. That was my first mistake. Now I'm stuck with a case I cannot use.Thanks Palm!!!"
2,The Cutting Edge,"I have titled this the cutting edge for a specific reason. I cut my finger trying to open the case. This has got to be a major flaw which PalmOne designers totally missed. The case itself is nice, has a rubber edge for protection as well as on the back. The hinged aluminum cover is where the problems begin. You need a finger nail in order to open the snap of the case. The edge is sharp and if you happen to slide your fingernail against the edge of the case, you can expect to get cut which is what happened to me. The price of the case does not warrant the design flaws and it is way too expensive considering that the Life Drive already costs an arm and a leg. I hope that PalmOne will take a look at this case and make improvements for functionality and safety."
1,Poor Design,"I think the concept of the case is good-very protective. However, I found it next to impossible to open the case. It was very irritating and time-consuming."
3,Ok case but nothing more then that,I would say don't buy this case when you buy your life drive. First try the cover that comes with the Lifedrive i think it better then the hard cover.I personally don't have problems opening the cover but i think the palm is not very save in it's cover. It just doesn't stick to the drive. so when you put your cable in you lifedrive you also push your palm out of it's cover.It's not as good as the hardcovers i had on my Palm vX and M515 i would say look for something better and till then use the cover that is included in the package.
1,worse case ever,"I have to use a dime to pry open this case. Look at the ""catch"" on the door- it is uncoated aluminum and is designed to be opened like an old fashioned mint tin. It can be easily bent or pushed in and this could damage the glass surface. My husband can pry it open with some effort, but I can't. Further, when you pull the lifedrive out, the rubber coating leaves ""skid marks"" on the keys."
4,Good Book for Elementary School,"I bought this book for my 5th grade daughter since she had to do a written and oral report on the digestive system. The book is well written for anyone to understand. The pictures are fantastic. This book provided a majority of the information my daughter needed for her report. The only reason I did not give this book a 5 star rating is because it didn't include very much information on disorders of the digestive system. That information would have been nice to see included, but we were able to get plenty of disorder information on the internet."
1,more cliche than fact,"If you like the books of Alvin Toffler, this one is worth a look, but if you prefer more substance, look elsewhere. Far from earth-changing and monumental, this is psuedo-intellectual pap."
2,Scones,Really dry and just not as good as could be. A disappointment after using this companys other products.
4,Good but...,"These ""tubes"" are an awesome buy but there is a slight problem with the. While they protect your ipod, they actually scratch it when you take it in and out. This isnt really a problem since you should have a cover on all the time but I think its kinda silly that the very thing that is suppose to be protecting them is scratching them. Ohh well... the ipod looks amazingly cool in them though. Pretty good buy although i would recommend looking at other possibilities."
5,Pretty Sweet,ok i got my ipod nano like a week or 2 ago and i really needed a case for it so i went out and got a Belkin Carabineer case and the stitching came undone i really loved that case but decided to get somthng else (and i thought about getting a iSkin Duo but has anyone else noticed the thickness!) so i went to Circut City and saw these and saw how thick they were and bought these and they're really great (i also had a screen protector for it)
4,Cha..... totally worth it,"Hey, I am 13 and got my nano just yesterday, I got the tubes and they are awsome, but there is one thing about them that bothers me, on the sides of the nano, it's scratched.. But i seriously do not really care as long as there arn't any scratches on the front and back.. I would recommend it only if u have a screen protector..Later.."
5,Protection Is Not A Problem,"I know that these were designed to keep my iPod safe, well these do a great job at it, so safe that you can hardly get them off once you put a tube on! If you have a docking station for you Nano - I would not get these because you have to remove the skin in order to dock you Nano! I like the fact that you get five different colors in the pack - however I don't see myself changing it often with such a tight fit! This is good buy for the money, and protects my iPod wonderfully!"
4,Good product!,"The quality of this product is superior, however, the fit is quite tight. I guess that's the object, making sure the iPod won't slip out accidentally. It makes you think twice about changing colors!"
5,Most Unwanted Song is actually good,"I used to have a copy of this album, but it disappeared in one of my moves a few years ago. I found the Most Wanted Song a bit insipid, but the Most Unwanted Song is actually quite good, in a weird sort of way.Of course, maybe I'm one of the 200 oddballs who will actually like it.5 stars because the idea is so cool, even though the Most Wanted Song is boring."
5,This is an excellent book,"It is old, almost impossible to find, and I suspect that only the author and I have ever read it but it is a very good book.I am a structured settlement expert and do financial planning for injury victims and often quote this book in lectures.First book I ever came across on the psychology of receiving sudden wealth. The insights into the guilt that injured people and people who inherit wealth sometimes feel is priceless. Worth owning just for that.Took me about a year to get a second copy of the book after my original was lost but it is worth waiting to have again.Don McNay..."
4,Decent bath toy,"We got a lot of use out of this toy. My first child received this as a gift a couple of years back and it has now been handed down to her baby brother. It's fairly durable, intellectually challenging and suitably interactive. My one complaint - minor - it that the suction cups, which are removable, sometimes lose suction. You can spend all of 'bath time' fiddling with the cups to try and find 'purchase' to secure the toy to the bathtub wall. Not a big deal, since usually a quick cleaning, maybe a wipe of the bathtub wall with a paper towel, and voila': suction.Good toy."
1,"""Economy says it all""","I went against my own rule and bought the economy version of a tool. I thought ""what could be wrong with a live center?"". Plenty. Initially, the bearing didn't turn at all. I ended up spraying some lube in the bearing (which isn't good for the bearing but it was the only way I could get it to turn). Now I just noticed that the point is GONE. The point/bearing housing is made out of some cheap cast pot metal and it obviously overheated when the bearing wasn't turning and just disappeared. So now it's virtually useless. Go for the more expensive live center."
2,UHF loop is useless!!,I ordered this antenna to enhance the reception of the UHF channels. I live in a big city and I thought I shouldn't have a problem with any indoor antenna. it seems I was mistaken. this antenna is useless. it is almost no better than my previous 99 cents store antenna.
2,Marginal reception,Offers only marginal reception in the Chicago area for DTV. Amplified versions of this type of antenna work better.
4,Does the Job,I don't know what I expected. It does the job but no better than any other antenna I've used. The big advantage for me is the A/B switch built into it. I can quickly change from my $10/mo analog cable to HD for my local channels with the push of a button.
5,Works great for me,"Works great for meat least at the price I got it. Though the not as strong as I expected, but I get all the channels I am looking for."
3,Cheep solution for good reception,"Works fine on new Digital HD TV. I was using on a second story in home TV with 3 mile distance to mountain top broadcasting signals above me. Not rural but in a city of 1/2 a million people. Population located between me and antenna with no reception problem. Set up and worked. Tried on a basement TV and it would not work down there. A ""Buy Item"" if you have a clear shot from the antenna to the tower at 3 miles works great for me."
5,An impressively documented history of the discovery and utilization of perpetual motion machines,"Perpetual Motion: The History Of An Obsession by Arthur W.J.G. Ord-Hume is an impressively documented history of the discovery and utilization of perpetual motion machines. As for most scientists and inventors, perpetual motion had become the potential discovery that would enable the generation of a much greater technology, for some it had become an obsession, and still today there may remain a number of mysterious processes in which perpetual motion seems without explanation. Discover the most intriguing history of perpetual motion in Perpetual Motion which is very highly recommended to all readers especially to those students of general sciences and aspiring mechanics and invention, as well as non-specialist general readers with an interest in alternative science."
5,Perpetually readable...,Best overall account of Redheffer's Perpetual Motion claim published to date.
4,Good Book on the Business of Art,"This book is pretty good for any artist looking to make a jump to the next level in their career. It was good enough for me to give it to another artist friend of mine, when I got done reading it. It's not the traditional cookie-cutter art business book(you see everywhere), and I did glean some insight by reading it. Recommended.-Andie deRoux[...]"
3,For the beginner,"This book was really for the beginner whom wants a career as an artist. This is a great book for a beginner. There was very little new information for me which was disappointing. That said it was motivational, and provided information about taxes for the artist and consignment forms which was in fact information that I knew very little about. It was a quick read so if you have access to a copy then you might as well read it but be forewarned, there was no information on grants which was my motivation for purchasing the book. Sorry Cay!"
5,"Excellent, Intimate Performances","I almost didn't buy this disc. The guy at the store said the performances and sound quality were lousy. But I didn't trust him and went for it anyway, being the Croce lover I am. I'm glad I did get it. The sound is very good to excellent and the performances are too. These are not the kind of live performances I expected: they look more like something set up in a large studio in front of a TV audience. Still, the stripped down approach of two guitars and voice works great and makes for an intimate look at many of Jim's hits."
3,An average dvd,Music gets 4 stars and visuals 2 stars for an overall rating of 3 stars. I prefer his music on CD without the visuals given that it is so dated from the early 1970's.
4,Part of my collection,Lets face it - if you're a Jim Croce fan you have to have this DVD as it contains the only available footage of him.The songs on the DVD speak for themselves.The only thing they should do differently is make the interviews with AJ and Ingrid special features on their own and not just an audio track on top of photograph footage.I thought the photo montage of him and his young family was incredibly sad. I couldn't help feeling for young AJ
4,Jim Croce Live,"Great, A+ The Tallent of our Age.. Ranks with the Greats of this Century & Lots more to come !"
4,Light hearted intro to puberty,"I bought this on the recommendation of a mother with sons older than mine. My son was 10/11 at the time and she thought it was an amusing way to pave the way for a more serious discussion. It was too simplistic for him and he pooh-poohed it, but my 6/7 year old daughter was fascinated by it. Now that she's 9 and facing these issues herself, it's helpful for us to use this book as a non-threatening explanation of what's happening with her. I think it's successful because she did have the earlier introduction to it.Witty and light-hearted, it still is factual and clear. Definitely worth using."
2,Beware - you may get a pink set,"These handles are great, but the description that lists the colors you may get is incorrect. I received a blue set and a pink set. Having a correct list of the potential colors would be helpful as I would not have ordered these if I had known I may get a pink set for my son."
1,missing a handle,"The product is sold as 2 handles, the photo shows 2 handles, the cardboard packaging states 2 handles. But only 1 handle arrived in the mail. Really? Come on!"
3,Concertina beginnings,"For the relatively small cost, this source should give the beginning player the basics of scales and two-handed techniques for the anglo concertina. The charts are clear, and help to show the logical arrangement of the instrument. Songs are a bit hokey at times, but again should suffice for the beginner, or those who wish to improve their sight-reading skills."
4,Perfect beginners book,After reviewing this book I was able to take my new concertina right out of the box when it arrived and begin to play. My wife was amazed and made the comment that the concertina must be the easiest instrument in the world is to play. I had never even held a concertina before. I am not ready for public performances but this book helped me to play some simple tunes that my wife reconized right away.The book does contain some music for tunes I had never heard before. It did make it easier to play tunes that were familiar. So I wish this book had more music for familiar folk tunes.
2,Major errors,"I was trying to use the fingering chart at the beginning to convert some music to concertina and found errors. For example, it shows left hand 9 push as being both b and c. I've come across a couple of other errors, so I wonder how many there are in the book."
3,Very Basic - but a reasonable way to start,This is a very basic book on anglo concertina. Contains some of the essentials but probably would work better in conjunction with actual lessons (wouldn't they all!). Worth the $ if you're new to the instrument.
4,Good beginning,Excellent beginning place for learning the Anglo concertina. I like the mix of known and obscure traditional music in it.
4,book,gotta learn o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o t t t t t t ta a a a a a aa
2,This speaker is ...,I think this speaker is alright if you have a smaller amp for it I had a 4000watt amp on it and it destroyed the speaker had a nice bandpass enclosure for it it did shake the whole block very well up until the break though very good maybe if you have lower watts on your amp
5,Vintage Dibango,An excellent CD. A must-have for those who enjoy the music of Manu Dibango. Has more authentic african tunes and beats. Too bad the CD is no longer available - I have the cassette but want to buy the CD.
3,Not the best... nowhere near,"This book was a difficult read for me. First of all, she kept referring to Daniel's BLONDE hair. In one scene there was a reference to Amanda Carter (played by Samantha Tapping, maybe?) and she mentioned a Stargate in Iceland. I assume she was referring to the season one episode where the 'gate was in Antartica. I was just happy she got the name of Jack's son right. I got the feeling that this book was hastily thrown together and I got an all-together bad feeling from it. It was an excellent story, but I've read fan fiction that was better."
2,Don't Waste Your Time,"The book trodded along for far too long, without any real plot. 304 pages went by before the author was stunned to realize she should probably stop writing and wrapped up the entire thing in two pages. There are many, many fan fiction stories which are superior to this one. Even the bad fan fic is over before you have time to worry about it's shoddiness. The basic errors (Daniel's BLONDE hair) and AMANDA Carter proved to me that this book was thrown together. I wish I had waited before buying this book. Live and learn, I suppose."
2,This review is going to sound like the others...,"Good point: The plot is an interesting idea.Bad points: No background for the characters, jumps right into the story and the story does seem to end VERY swiftly. I wanted more about the planet, the alien race and more interaction between SG-1 itself. Details, details to give it flavor, color, shapes, to make it a meal to enjoy. This book was more like pre-chewed gum!Weak and not for a person NEW to the TV series. This is my first read from the book series and I hope the first three books were BETTER. Maybe starting from the beginning would have been better..."
1,"Awful, awful book!","Seldom do you get such a clear idea of why a series of books has been discontinued. The author not only got several key details wrong (calling Daniel a blonde, at one point referring to Amanda Carter), but the story was convaluted and pointless. It seemed they pulled the resolution out of thin air. I don't know about you, but I prefer a little more thought to go into solutions. It also ended way too soon. How did they get home? How'd they get past the aliens? We don't know and, I believe, neither does Ms. McConnell.If they plan to make more Stargate SG-1 books, perhaps they could find someone who has actually seen an episode or two."
1,does the author even know who the characters are?,"When the author used the name Amanda Carter, my suspicion that this novel was not all that good, was cemented. And what was up with the Dr. Frasier and Jack O'Neill flirtation? If you love the show, don't ruin it by reading this book. Find a fanfic writer you like <or 2 or 3> and stay with them."
1,Even worse than The First Amendment,"This book was even worse than the last one. I waited alomst 6 months to buy this and it was an utter disappointment. It was either incredibly boring or just plain ridiculous. The aliens in the book seemed to resemble colorful Ewoks. Then, there were the dream sequences. These seemed to drag on forever and grew increasingly more stupid by the page. Such as O'Neill swimming with an Ewok transformed into an octopus. This novel seemed like a sick joke. I kept hoping as I read it, that I would wake up and find that it was just a horrible nightmare. Even more so as I found mistake after mistake. The ending seemed like something I would have expected from a Goosebumps book. I think it's time for the people at Stargate to hire a decent author like Peter David."
2,Better than the others but not much.....,"No offence to the author but I think its time we had someone else take a crack at the SG-1 novel. As others have pointed out there were plenty of inconsistancies and downright errors. As I recall O'Neill keeps refering to Daniel as Jackson which seems kindoff formal. The Amanda Carter error really bugged me (Im a fan, what did you expect?). I agree that the ending was waaaaay too abrupt. There should have been at least 50 more pages wrapping up the story. After I read the last page I remeber thinking, ""Where the heck is the rest of the book?"". I found myself rereading the last few chapters to see if I had missed something. If this is going to be the norm for SG-1 novels in the future this fan is going to loose interest fairly quickly. At ten loonies a pop they are a likely to become a tough sell."
1,Lives up to its title...,"... it totally put me to sleep! I literally felt myself dozing off only a few chapters into the novel, it was so incredibly boring. The plot was just so ludicrious that I didn't connect with the story at all."
4,Morpheus Factor is more comfortable with the charaters,"This book is considerably better than the others McConnell has written as far a characterization goes. They react more like friends than just teammates and the ending isn't as depressing. The storyline is a not as straightforward as her other books. Towards the end of the book, I thought that the plot got a bit more confusing than usual and some small hints of romantic interest were conflicting with the episodes in Season 4. It is still a very good book and I enjoyed it much more than 'The Price You Pay'. If you enjoy Stargate SG-1, this is one you will want to get!"
3,"Eh, adequate but not great","This story is definitely not very well written, with obvious mistakes and a too-quick ending. I enjoyed learning a little bit about lucid dreaming, so that made the book tolerable. I'm not clear on why Teal'c's symbiote didn't protect him from the inhaled substances. If you're not very familiar with the TV show Stargate SG-1 this book probably won't make too much sense because you won't get the references to other events. Characters from the show who appear in the book include: Sam Carter, Jack O'Neill, Teal'c, Daniel Jackson, Janet Fraiser, and George Hammond. The story takes place sometime after Sam Carter is promoted to Major. If you're a die-hard collector, go ahead and get this one used. But if you're only a casual fan, there are much better stories out there so skip this one."
1,Don't waste your time and money on this one,"This film not only contains gross historical and factual errors, it contain a string of misrepresentations. You are better of with another good title such as 'The legacy of the Prophet', Inside Islam - Discovery Channel', 'Islam - Empire of Faith', 'Haj - National Geographic'. (All are available from Amazon).My copy has gone in the bin, that is where it belongs. I did however cringe and watch all of 6 hours of it, Why?"
1,First book I've ever returned.,"I was hoping for more. This book is written by accomplished women with lots to say. Presumably, none of them had time to say it, because this work is only a first and superficial pass at a cnallenging problem. That still would have been enjoyable, but for the incredible $58.00 price. This book might be useful for a wealthy 23 year old contemplating a career. For those of us ""in the trenches"", the subtitle of one chapter, there is nothing here you don't already know. I believe these authors could form the nucleus of a worthwhile, in depth sequel, perhaps including surveys and casting a wide net among us for thoughtful solutions. (I am the male half of a two physician marriage, now in its 16th year.)"
3,Recording is not worthy of the music,"This is fine music. Blackjack county is a great song and these guys perform like the pros that they are. However that said, Why baby why could never come close to the original, and much more whoever recorded and or mastered this was not doing it right. The instruments are somehow louder than the voices. On blackjack county this is the most annoying because the lines are sung low and nearly whispered in some places. Trying to hear what they're saying is difficult because you have to keep turning the stereo up and ignoring the loudness of the instruments. This is fine music [A little to slick for me in some parts] with fine performances, just terrible sound on several of the songs. If I had lost the cd I wouldn't buy it again even though I liked it. That is how I rate them. If I lost them, would I buy them a second time? No. I'd get something from either waylon or willie instead of both more likely."
1,DID NOT GET PRODUCT,Ordered this product. I was sent a substitute item. It was a topical desensitizer with lidocaine. Was not happy. Condom use desensitizes more than enough. Had no need for a desensitizer. Called the customer service number. They agreed to credit my account for the amount I was charged for the throw away product. It has been several weeks. No refund. Guess I will be calling again. DO NOT ORDER AS YOU WILL PROBABLY NOT RECEIVE THIS PRODUCT
4,nice,Love the lions shirt. The feel is great and I get a lot of compliments on it. One thing I noticed is the sleeves are not real long. I'm 6' tall and the large fits fine but sleeves are barely long enough.
5,Dominican 100%,"Azucarado is a tremendous Dominican group with a genuine merengue rhythm that's upbeat, fast paced, catchy and most of all danceable. This is their third album and they keep getting better. Their music has always been good and their trade mark is ""merengue rapido"" but in this album they experimented with a cumbia-merengue sound (# 4 El Loco) and bachata (# 5 Vamos a olvidarla) which is an incredible song sung ""a duo con Frank Reyes"". All the other songs are either fast paced or hard hitting which are essentials components of good merengue. If you have not tried any of the three albums by Azucarado I recommend all of them-Endulzate con Azucarado, Muevete and this one. All are available on Amazon.com. If you like faced paced merengue or merengue ""suave"" Azucarado's music can offer you the best of the best."
3,very small shells,"I bought this charm bracelet and found that the shells are very small, much smaller than I imagined from the photo. I wear it with another charm bracelet and it is fine."
1,not enough action,"the book takes place over a very long time witch makes it very hard yo follow. also there isn't enouigh action, that bothers me alot"
5,"Good, all natural hair oil!","This product is quite good, especially for black hair. It has a strong odor though, so beware!"
3,Not bad if you don't mind the smell!,"I have thick, curly, course hair and not many hair products can get my hair under control. This is one of the few that can- it's much thicker than any silicone hair serum I've used.The only problem for me is the smell! It is overpowering and I don't like my hair to smell like food all day.I probably will continue to use it, but I'll be on the lookout for something that has a more subtle scent."
2,Meh...,"Left my hair a little greasy after washing... Not sure any of the benefits of this product are proven, and the smell is sickening. I would not purchase again."
4,Improves hair growth,"I have been punished by karma I guess, because I have inherited pretty thin hair that tend to fall out easily. I have been looking for a product that improves hair growth. Don't know if it even exists. Rogaine can't be used by women, so well, bad luck. When I came across this product at my hair salon, it looked promising also being a natural product. I used it as directed for a month now and not only running it through my hair, but I also massage it into the roots. I don't want to sound overly optimistic, but I think my hair is not falling out at the same catastrophic rate as it used to. That's a good news. Now, the bad news is that this oil is well - oily. It takes 2-3 shampooing to wash it out. Small price to pay for good results."
5,This is my favorite hair cair product,"This is by far the best hair oil treatment I've used, I don't use it on a daily basis, I use it as a hot oil treatment every once in a while (once or twice a month), I don't have permed or dyed hair but this leaves it soft and healthy, and I've also heard that it works great on chemically treated hair. Use it once a month, then don't do any heat styling or chemical treatments for about 2 months and you can grow healthy long hair."
5,Love This Product!,"I have extremely thick, coarse hair that I am growing out. As such, I usually have to apply a great deal of heat and product in order to gain some control over my hair. This product has been a Godsend to me! While others comment about the scent, I find it pleasant and don't notice the smell after it's been applied and my hair is dried. The oil is light, but be careful not to use too much or you can get a greasy look to your hair. the oil gives me much more control, it smooths my hair, and conditions it in the process. Highly recommended."
5,FANTASTIC!!!!,I READ REVIEWS ON THIS PRODUCT & DECIDED TO TRY IT. TO START I HAVE CURLY HAIR THAT IS PRONE TO DRYNESS & FRIZZ. THIS PRODUCT GOES ON NICELY IT'S NOT HEAVY OR OVERLY GREASY. IT ADDS A NICE SHEEN TO MY USUALLY LACK LUSTER HAIR. THE SMELL IS FRESH BUT DOES FADE WITH TIME. MY HAIR AND SCALP JUST DRINK UP THIS GREAT OIL I LOVE IT.
5,:),My mom use this in her hair and she loves it.she will buy this product again I wish they made a bigger bottle though
1,Don't buy this!,"My one star is not for the cartoon but the DVD itself.Over here in rainy old England, you can get the complete set of Ulysees cartoons (Yes, every episode ever made) for around 20 pounds. So for you, that would be about $40.Hunt it down!!!!!See ya."
4,"Good, but not perfect",An excellent selection from this great series. Only slight thing that mars this release is the non-original score at the start.
5,The Healing Energy of Your Hands,I am a Reiki Master and as such am always looking for books about healing and energy. This book has been a real treat for me. I found Michael Bradford to be an excellent author who is able to speak to each person through his words. This book is written in a down to earth manner that anyone can understand. I am using some of his techniques for healing already. I am so glad I found this book. :-)
4,The Healing Energy of your Hands,I found this book to be easy to read and very informative with some easy to follow diagrams.
3,It is a o.k. book on spiritual healing,After reading this book it seem that the main focus of it was on energy forces and how thoes forces can be used in the healing process. If you are interested in learning how your energy effects your health then this is the book. If you are interested in overall spiritual healing processes and instructions then this may not be the book.
2,Wimpy but painful,"The first time I did this workout, I hurt my neck, and the pain continued for a couple of days. I'm not sure I qualify as a wimp because I work out regularly, but this isn't the workout for me."
4,As advertised,"Works on both inside and outside lathe spindles. 1"" 8 teeth per inch thread. Good for my Powermatic and other lathes."
2,Poor Choice for serious woodturner.,"This is a poor choice at a high price for a serious wood turner. Only 4 mounting holes make mounting large pieces risky. Oneway has a better built 6"" RH/LH thread faceplate with 24 screwholes for about $3 less. It's true that there aren't many choices for dual thread faceplates, but this one won't serve you very well."
2,Wow!,"Love this set, but it's way overpriced... so went searching and found this exact set for less than 1/2 of list price here..."
2,"Adequate performance, few replacement parts available","I bought this 120 volt welder for my son 3 years ago. It performed well an average of 20 times a week welding light materials in a motorcycle customizing shop. After 2 years the torch head began having problems and performance declined. It became unusable recently and I tried to get replacement parts. Clarke is out of business now and some parts, including the torch assembly we need, are not to be found. My son had to get a new comparable welder (Lincoln) and is quite happy."
3,Ok but you get what you pay for,Its ok for a cheap machine but I would advise you to go with a lincoln or miller. I just bought one and it did ok on 1/8 steel. I had to go slow and with the heat all the way up on setting four to get penatrationand wire on 2. I dought that it would weld 1/4 in a single pass but I am no professional just your everyday handy man. Like I said ok for the price.
2,Company is kaput,"I've had this model for a few years now and use it for odd things around the house and a few honey do project. It works well for what it is. The real knock I have with this product is that the company, when it was open for business, was pretty hard to get parts from. Unlike the other brands, Clarke does everything a little bit different, so you can't get replacement parts, or find local shops for repairs. Now that they're out of business, the next thing that breaks will sending me shopping for another unit."
4,Early Loy,"If you love the Thin Man, you need to see Ms Loy as something less than noble and nice. You will love hating her"
4,good old movie,Myrna Loy play's a woman of mixed blood who goes to college with women who treat her really bad so she desided to get even. She has special powers & can look someone in the eye & make them do what she tells them to do. She goes after these women & one after the other they die. One of the last women she goes after is Irene Dunne & she targets her little boy. It really gets you going near the end. It's another wonderful old movie with two great stars in it.
1,Buyer beware!,I purchased this 100 pack and the sent me only 1. Several calls to customer service got me no where. Do not buy!
1,Revisionist History of the 20th Century,"To claim that the 20th century was a battle of the economic ideas of Von Hayek and Keynes is absurd. The claim that socialist central planning dominated the 20th century from World War I to Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan is equally absurd. Although this DVD is purportedly about Economics, there is no discussion of the underlying numbers and statistics and no discussion of the role of technological change. Volume II, ""The Agony of Reform"", is an interesting history of the free market reforms of Chile, Bolivia, Poland and Russia. Overall, however, I do not recommend this 3 volume set."
4,Learning,"this is a great movie to learn about the economy. It will spark your interest and make you want to dive deeper into what economics is all about. Once you watch this read ""Naked Economics"""
5,"Excelent, my best DVD purchase ever!","This is truly the best documentry I have ever seen. I enjoyed every bit of this very positive and erudite story about our recent history. And I agree fully with the Washington Post if they say - ""No more important program for making sense of our life and times has been seen in at least a decade."".This is not a romantic moralistic story of recent history with lots of moral driven finger pointing, no thank you, this is a factual account of how the Western system is developing through the world by what some call globalization. It discribes the changes in recent history and what pain they brought, but also what the motives behind these changes are and what the benefits are.Some people here complain it is too positive about the current direction of history. I do not agree, it is quit factual. But indeed, it does not conform to the so often voiced negative world views that are so often hearth. So, if you like freedom, then I am sure you love this documentry."
5,A summary of economics in the last century,"A captivating presentation of the recent history of economic ideas (Neoclassicals vs Keynesians vs Marxism) and economies. It describes the evolution of our understanding of an economy. It presents the case for globalisation, reminds the risks of financial crises and social instability for those countries that get it wrong, and acknowledges that all of the answers are not yet clear. Those who claim that globalisation has only widened the gap between the have's and have-not's can see that it is not a zero sum game. While the forces of supply and demand may cause hardship in the short run, over time, these same forces create stronger, more properous economies. Not since Heilbroner's ""The Worldly Philosophers"" has it been shown how the ideas of a few, so-called dismal scientists profoundly affect the lives of millions of people."
4,Commanding your attention,"Free markets or central planning? Hayek or Keynes?I have seen this documentary a couple of times since it came out and found it very informative and absorbing for it's world historical/economic/political perspective. I should say, I never look to just one source of information no matter how persuasive.I brought it out again yesterday to watch in particular Part 3 which brought the film to it's then current times during the GW Bush administration, just after 9/11, the Seattle Summit demonstrations, and after the market collapses of Thailand, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea and Russia. This film was so pertinent, it could have very easily just continued on to the 2007/2008 US and world economic collapse and the devastation and adjustments that we are still living with today right up to the Summit demonstrations in Toronto.I highly recommend this film.The Creation and Destruction of Value: The Globalization CycleHow Markets Fail: The Logic of Economic Calamities"
5,Just a wonderful production of an important topic,"A typically great PBS production of a great book - also highly recommended - about the forces of good - Friedman, Hayek, etc. - against the forces of tyranny/socialism throughout most of this century. A battle still being fought today. Friedman and Hayak are revolutionary heros, and their fight goes on."
5,One of the best and most informative videos I've ever watched,"Incredibly well rounded interviews including a broad set of opinions. I am amazed they were able to interview so many of the people directly involved in making the decisions that shaped this century.Thought provoking and filled with interesting lessons and anecdotes. A must watch for anyone that is interested in history/economics/politics/development/finance/etc.... so yes, highly recommended."
5,Draws no attention..,"I use it with my Canon 5D, 15 fisheye, 50 1.4 and 70-300DO and 430ex flash. It all fits! I've used it at zoo's, sporting events and family gatherings with no attention gathered b/c of it's small size. I use the waist straps for street photos and shoulder strap around my chest in airports.Really nice bag."
5,No small wonder,It tastes good and is in good taste. This is a great source of fine cooking in the Virginia tradition. Lots of seafood and goodies.
5,Brilliant,Mary Roldán has authored a masterpiece. She destroys many simplistic viewpoints often used in Washington to justify U.S. aid. The author uses a powerful prism to examine the violence in Colombia. She concludes that paramilitary death squads are one of the greatest threats to democracy in Colombia. Roldán's research is impressive. She deserves loud applause.
2,Not worth buying.,"While the product came as promised, it cost more to ship than the product itself.Do yourself a favor, and buy it straight from the Weleda Website.It's definitely cheaper in the long run."
2,Trite,"It sounded interesting. A women seeks revenge on an abusive boyfriend. But I only liked the last 20 or 30 minutes when she was giving him and her mean father their just dues. Why? Because the plot was weak and the acting wasn't very good. Thankfully, it wasn't too long."
1,ineffective,This spray had no effect on our cavaliers snoring even finished the spray with no change in the severity of the dogs snoring.
3,okay,"Very okay product. Great price from amazon, as usual. Does its job, but not as well as the pills, and thus I will likely be a repeat purchaser of this brand (for the pills) but not the spray."
1,Didn't work for my Cavalier King Charles,"It actually made him sleep deeper, making his snores louder. I'm afraid there's no hope for my little snoring dog."
2,Obsolete,"Clever design for use with and without stand. That it connects to your television or converter box via old design, 75-ohm flat wire results in a weaker signal than should be expected from any modern indoor antenna. I loved the loop antenna for UHF. It made me think of the old days of black-and-white TV."
2,Won't pick up 2 major stations,"This antenna just will not pick up NBC on channel 3 or channel 19. Other stations do come in good, but I cannot be satisfied without those other 2 stations."
2,well good for 2-3 chanels,"Not good at all, I was avoiding to make wholes in the wall for cable. So, thought may be this little Terk Technology TV-1 Passive Indoor TV Antenna might show me few channels, but i was wrong.Plus shipping tool almost 24 days. Can you believe that?Bottom line i am not satisfied."
4,Powered reception from a passive antenna,I have two antennas I have tried for receiving digital channels. One is a power boosted antenna that draws electricity while in use (and when you forget to turn it off). The other is the passive Terk TV-1. I get the exact same channels with both antennas. I don't get the number of channels I would normally expect but I am in an apartment (bottom floor) so there is a lot of interference you wouldn't get in a home.
4,Decent cheap antenna,"Overall I am impressed with the antenna, it does a better job than some of the 20-50 dollar range indoor antenna's and its better built than the $30 Zenith antenna I got.I did hitch this up to an amp to see if it would improve it any, and I really didn't notice much difference between reception with or without the amp. Later on my zenith one bit the dust (fell off the TV due to stomping kids), so I bought another one of these."
3,Typical rabbit ears - it works but nothing special,"The Terk TV-1 is your typical rabbit ears that works if you are in a good reception area and it does picks up HD. I have used two other antennas - a small portable $5 antenna and a $30 amplified antenna. My smaller antenna picked up all the HD channels I needed except NBC. The Terk did pick up NBC, but only if you orient it in a certain direction. However, the Terk wasn't as good as a $30 amplified antenna I used to have which picked up more channels than the Terk.One annoying thing about the Terk is the adapter it comes with that goes into your TV's coaxial plug. It doesn't screw into the coaxial plug properly, but rather you just have to try to squeeze it on the TV and it doesn't fit perfectly. The antenna still works fine, but I think they could have just made a regular adapter that screws onto the TV."
3,Pretty good,"This antenna is good, but not outstanding. I just needed something to get some channels and it did the trick."
5,Works like a charm,I bought this for my new Sharpe EDTV LCD panel TV. I don't have cable and we were getting horrible reception. I bought this Terk TV-1 antenna and the picture we are now getting is incredible. I would recommend this before you try something more expensive.
4,GOOD PRICE FOR GOOD RECEPTION!,I have just installed 2 of these antennas for 2 of my old TV sets combined with the HD converter boxes. So far reception is good and it gives me all local channels in Chicago. Price is right for the quality of image I get. If anybody is looking for more channels or super HD reception then get cable or satelite. No compaints from me so far.
3,Doesn't Combine UHF and VHF,"When I purchased this product I thought the UHF loop would connect somewhere on the ""rabbit ear"" base and be combined into one signal. I was apparently wrong. I was surprised to open the box and see that I needed to have UHF terminals on my TV to connect the loop antenna. I wasn't too impressed. I'll be returning the product for one that actually combines the UHF and VHF signals as most of the broadcast spectrum used in my area is in the UHF range."
3,Just OK,I heard alot of good things about this antenna but it is just OK. Nothing great. I get a few channels but usually have to readjust the antenna for clarity.
1,Antenna review,This product did not work any better with the digital converter box than the rabbit ears that came with the old analog TV set.
2,Poorly Designed!,"This antenna has two design flaws that make it unusable for me. The first problem is that the cable that goes from the antenna to the TV is too short. It doesn't reach from the back of my TV, through the back of the entertainment center, to the top of the entertainment center. The antenna only picks up channels if it is on top of the entertainment center, but to hook it up there I have to have the cable go in front of the TV. The other problem is that the antennas only move side to side. They are not adjustable from front to back. I have only been able to get two channels. Overall, I haven't been impressed. I'm going to have to buy a different one."
2,NOT so good,"I bought this based on reviews. It works, but not so good. I have put it in different places and use it with a converter box.I get one channel great the other 4 channels are fuzzy and go in and out. I am about 26 miles from the big TV broadcast towers. I am now buying a different antenna.The Philips SDV2210/17 UHF/VHF/FM/HDTV Indoor Antenna in hopes to get a good picture...watch for my comments on that one soon!"
2,It does not work!,"I read excellent review of this product and bought it. I have a Sony HDTV KDL26M4000 with in built HDTV tuner. First of all, the installation instruction is sketchy and confusing! There is no option on my HDTV of connecting VHF and UHF separately. The instructions that accompanied the product did not show with any helpful diagram how to connect. Also the product came with a loop (which I guess is the UHF loop). The installation intructions do not carry any information about how and where to attach it. None of the reviewer has mentioned anything about this either. With auto programming options, I could get only 3 channels coming clearly. I live in an open area without ant big tree or building and I tried with placing the antenna on my window shield! Can anybody help please?"
2,"UHF ok, VHF is separate with no attachment!","I'm not impressed. This is a UHF antenna that comes with a completely separate VHF ""loop"" that you have to attach entirely separately directly to the back of your TV, and if your TV doesn't have the VHF screws on the back of it, there are no suggestions for other ways to attach the antenna--not that there is any SPACE among all the wires back there even if my TV had the screws... I gave two stars because the UHF antenna does work, but I do not recommend this product unless you know how to jury-gig a VHF antenna."
4,Good product for it's price range,"This is one of the inexpensive antenna that works well. I have it for a year, it works better then the one I have paid more. It's small yet works better then those big one with switch turner. The only thing is I still unable to get some of the channels available. But for the price, you can't ask for too much."
1,missing parts,"The antenna is great, pulls in more stations than my old rabbit ears BUT, on delivery, was missing a critical part. I contacted Audiovox and they sent a part, but it was the WRONG PART. I contacted Audiovox again; their customer service tried to convince me I didn't know what I was talking about. Finally, after multiple transfers and being kept on hold, their technical support division backed me up and I was mailed the right part. This took two weeks!!"
2,Doesn't work very well,"I have tried this antenna many times camping. I have tried it in Vermont, the Lake George area of New York, and Connecticut. It never pulled in more than 2-3 stations, and they were always full of snow. None of the stations ever came in even decent.The only reason I give this antenna 2 stars is because without it reception was even worse. But it is still pretty worthless in my opinion.I will try this antenna again once I get a Digital Converter. Maybe that will make a difference."
1,Very Few Channels- you get what you pay for,"Hooked up to my converter box, it gets very few channels and needs to be adjusted constantly. I do live in a high rise building and have other buildings around me. My replacement is the RCA Ant1400 which is a digital flat antenna and this gets almost 30 channels compared to the 4 on the Terk."
2,Not what I hoped for,"It doesn't provide me with the reception I hoped it would. Plus the 'rabbit ears' only move up and down straight; they don't have any swiveling capability. The flat cord/attachment is very short, making it hard to place conveniently anywhere else than just right on top of the TV. Granted it was pretty cheap, but I wouldn't buy it again..."
4,Slow in the middle but thrilling at the end,"The last of the four sections is the heart of the book and contains the enthralling thoughts one expects after reading ""Introduction to Christianity"". For me, the text on art proved very dull and lifeless. But in the final section of the book, the Pope returns to the topic of active participation in the liturgy. He brings vitality and thought to these topics. The section on the Human Voice as part of the Mass is exceptional and thought provoking.Perhaps one day I will gain enough insight to revisit the middle sections. Undoubtedly, the last section will become familiar to all Catholics as the Mass adopts these thoughts in practice. Although I still have trouble with his thought of an oratio conducted largely in silence. The Eucharistic Prayer is the heart of the liturgy; to place it in silence seems a terrible loss."
2,delta lathe tool rest,"Inadequate for my application. tool rest post (should be 1"") would not fit my tool rest holder, which has a 1"" hole. I reduced the size of the shaft and then found the shaft is to short for proper use on my lathe. I did not return for refund because I altered the shaft diameter to fit my 1"" tool rest holder."
3,inexpensive tool rest for modification,"I have a more heavy duty tool rest for most of my use. But I found that sometimes my old tool rest was just a little long to tuck in on the backside of a bowl or other project without hitting the chuck/I ordered this lighter-duty rest and trimmed at least an inch off the left leg, so it now works better in that tricky spot. It was a lot cheaper than getting a heavy duty 6 inch tool rest and is now exactly as long as is needed. If I need to trim it some more for a particular project I will not hesitate to do so.I have not had any problem with breakage, but then I haven't used it nearly as much as my main tool rest."
3,Delta Tool Rest,"This tooling at best just functional, of marginal quality and way over priced as all Delta Accesories seem to be. The tool rest surface is reasonably strait and smooth as compared to other similar brands. So far I have had better like purchaseing after market goods for my Delta Lathe.There are iron castings a plenty but they very extensively in both material and workmanship."
2,WHAT IS THE SIZE OF THE SHANK? 5/8 OR 1 INCH,i NEED A 5/8 INCH TOOLE REST. THIS ITEM MAY MMET MY NEEDS IF THE SHANK IS THE CORRECT SIZE.THE ITME DESCRIPTION DOES NOT STATE THE SIZE.
2,"You think it would be good, now wouldn't you?","Well all of us thought it would be good. It had all the right ingredients, well except a handful of good songs worthy of this duo.Now don't get me wrong, if your idea of good country music is Ray Stevens; and you can take Barry Manilow in large doses, then you might like this. But, if you are a true country music fan who loves the off key wail of E.T. and Webb, then you will be disappointed in this.The only songs that seemed to be recorded while Jones and Hag were awake are C.C. Waterback, Yesterday's Wine, and No Show Jones. The rest are easily skipped by pushing the ""next"" button on your cd player.Just pass this one on by, and just say you have it."
4,Good overview of management accounting,"Used in an English language management accounting course in Poland with students from Poland, Czech and Germany. Good overview of mgt acc. Best feature - the many examples and exercises/problems with solutions. Considering the weight (since it was carried to Europe) and cost, this is an excellent text."
3,Children's,"This was written in England 1,200 yeasrs ago and takes place in Sweden. A dragon was in a cave for 300 years. A guy stole treasure from it so the dragon burnt the town. Beowulf the king had to kill the dragon. They did kill the dragon and Beowulf died."
2,Not A Genius,"I'm not saying this director is terrible...just overrated. He has interesting concepts that are never quite fully developed in my humble opinion. His Aphex Twin, Portishead, and Bjork videos certainly display a flair for the bizarre, but after watching them a couple times they don't seem so clever anymore. Being different is not the same as being creative."
2,were are the missing 300 minutes??????,"good, but nothing fancy, plus like other people pointed out, a lot of stuff missing...disappointing..amazon, still hasn't changed the duration of the dvd"
4,"Great videos, but could've been so much more...","Like the earlier reviews, the work shown is strong but there is a lot missing. Just giving a short taste of Flex is really cruel! What I think would put this collection over the top is more input from Chris Cunningham. The included book is just exerpts from an interview in Res magazine. I was hoping for at least commentaries on the included videos. If you watched the MTV2 special about this DVD, they have interview with other directors about Chris' work, etc. Why aren't any of these on the DVD?Still, the videos included are fascinating to watch over and over again. Just be careful because you will want more after seeing them all."
2,"The videos aren't bad, but the presentation is horrible...","""All is Full of Love"" is a brilliant video in every respect - it's perverse and transcendent at the same time, mixing in humaniform robots with flowing water and hard ceramic - it looks like the future of robot porn.However, what makes me only able to listen to it for brief periods is the menus. Whoever decided that it'd be a good idea to play a hideous cacaphony of every song on the disk, apparently played backwards and at high speed during the menu screens, ought to be horsewhipped for ruining an otherwise good disk. (Even if it is Chris Cunningham.) When the menu screens make you want to take the disk out and throw it out the window, you gotta reconsider the wisdom of doing that.Fortunately, I believe that ""All is Full of Love"" is available on another Bjork video collection, so I'll buy that and sell this one to the local CD/Video concern.-Darren MacLennan"
1,Doesn't work!,"If you are a UK customer - DO NOT BUY THIS! Bought one for myself and one as a gift and they didn't play - just read 'wrong region disc'. This should be made more clear when buying product. Better things to do with my time than to be sending back unsuitable goods, so didn't get a refund. I also received another one which I had cancelled so I've ended up with 3 completely useless DVDs!!! F***ING RIP OFF!"
3,Too scary,"Cunningham does have his own style that I've never found in others, and I appreciate that. But his visions on world seem to be too scary. As one pointed, there is no enduring narrative in his videos; only shocking or fanciful images are bouying. He seems to be only interested in 'effects', which fade away with repeated viewing, and I wouldn't buy it. These are horribly anti-humanistic videos, I would say. I wish he had more humor or a little bit of warmness in his video. (No, I'm not that conservative type of viewer at all.)"
3,"Good, but the least of the three","Of the three Director's Label DVDs, Chris Cunningham's is by far the least of the three. The work included here is great, but there are only eight videos and not a lot of extras, interviews or commentary.Most baffling is the fact that there are stills of videos in the booklet and in the DVD menu graphic that aren't included on the DVD. The clip for the Auteurs' ""Light Aircraft On Fire"" is the most confusing omission. I'm not sure if Chris didn't want them included or what, but the fact that so much of Michel Gondry's older work is included on his disc suggests that the director had control of what went on the disc and what didn't, and Chris decided to skimp on the content.Like I said, what's here is great, but if I could only buy one of the three discs it wouldn't be this one, if only because of the low quantity of material."
4,"Change Your Thinking, Change Your Chess","Most chess books aim to guide and instruct by offering principles, rules, schemes and theories. ""Creative Chess"", on the other hand, has a quite different and original approach. It firmly maintains that every chessplayer, whether amateur or master, is capable of creating something new in chess. After a discussion of the characteristics and processes of creativity, 10 central concepts, such as unusual positioning and functioning of pieces, alertness to subtle differences, absurd moves, flexibility, etc., are presented with a wealth of truly amazing examples to encourage the reader to broaden the horizons of his chess thinking. Whether or not the author's approach will improve your chess (I think it will), it is definitely a change of pace from your standard middlegame or opening text."
4,Re- Thinking Chess concepts,"Very good book for people with good knowledges, but with problems to aply in practice. Unortodox kind of thinking!"
3,"Like all his books, just examples","A book like this should teach creative chess, not just show examples of it. Too many chess books are like the juggler teaching juggling by saying, ""watch this!"" Then, he juggles and you say, ""wow, that's amazing!"" We don't really need a book to show us creative chess when we could look at any collection of games of top GMs and find more than enough creativity for a lifetime. The examples are entertaining, but I was disappointed because I expected more of an instructive manual."
5,Excellent Works,This is definitely the one CD I recommend besides Badmarsh's Differences EP to any fan of jungle and drum 'n bass music. Very catchy tunes with lots of cool sitars and some phat beats make this a CD worth your money!
4,CAREFULLY!!!,"the breaks and rhythms in many tracks are *quite* repetetive, sterile, and boring - lightweight and not mental or cut-up enough (for me), although the other sampling, sounds and intruments are perfect. This maybe a bit wishy washy for hardcore Jungle & dNb heads but the Indian influence is well dealt with and the CD really is a must for anyone interested in the cross over."
1,OFFENSIVE,"I threw it away after listening for the first time. I am not easily offended, love Chris Rock and the angry genre, but Kinson is really ugly with his humor. His politics are right of right, which may be part of the offense, but enough is enough."
5,ww II,"A very interesting first hand account of Nazi Germany at the begining of WW II from the perspective of a well known, German speaking, American newsman who had personal contact with the leaders of the third Reich. Worth reading."
4,I miss Harvey,"I first heard this while at a public radio station in Alaska. I hadn't heard from Harvey Mandel in years and I was happy to see he still had it. I hope your doing well in Crested Butte, Harvey. I guess you've gone back to the blues like all the old dudes do. I'll miss your unique fusion of rock, blues and jazz."
1,Seven7 *is* a copycat ripoff of Seven For All mankind,"""T. Griffith"" is wrong -- Seven7 is not the original brand, and is instead a ripoff made by the company ""Express"".In fact, ""Seven For All Mankind"" sued Express for the copyright infringement over their sub-brand, ""Seven7"". You can read about it here: http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FNP/is_20_42/ai_109665984"
1,"No, thanks","The description for this item says, ""dark indigo denim,"" but they are not dark. They have that faded dingy dirtly look. I personally can't abide that. They seem true to size, but they are LOOOOOW. If I had known that, I would not have ordered them. If you like showing your behind when you sit, you'll just love these. Since I had to return the lousy things, I didn't even try the tank top on. It just looks pretty ordinary, probably okay.The pockets and stitching are not as flattering as Levi's. For $50, I'll get two pairs (almost) of truly dark demin Levi's instead and spare the public a scary rearview."
1,These Are A Farce!!!,"When you order these jeans, you are led to believe that they are manufactured by ""Seven Jeans"" (as seen in finer department and specialty stores). THEY ARE NOT!!! They are not made by ""Seven for all Mankind"", do not resemble SFAM jeans and are made in China. I am very disappointed. This is clearly deceptive. They are cheap imitations that have the word ""Seven"" printed on them. Buyer Beware!!!!"
5,an old text but excellent survey,"too frugal to purchase a more current edition, i plunked down $4. this was a fine undergraduate introduction to the criminal justice system and psychological applications therein. a light read, often entertaining. an excellent survey of the field, although, the common complaint of survey texts that it doesn't ""do justice"" (bad pun) to enough topics could be argued here, too. it helped me to identify some topics about which i'd like to learn more and it identified some useful sources."
3,Pretty Good,"This CD was great, but it was not the Broadway Kids best album. For example, they recorded some dorky songs and the kids' voices sounded a little goofy in some songs. However, when you hear HAVE YOURSELF A MERRY LITTLE CHRISTMAS (vocalist: Amy Braverman) or CHRISTMAS IS A HOMEMADE HOLIDAY (vocalist: Eden Riegel) you won't regret buying this CD."
1,Nauseous and self-indulgent,"Where do I start? I gave it 1 star because there wasn't a negative star rating. These are without a doubt the most self-indulgent and just downright sickening song arrangements you could possibly imagine. Don't buy this if you like any of these songs because they don't sound anything like the originals. In a sloppy and irritatingly overdone way, the Broadway Kids try to modernize these oldtime Christmas favorites and end up butchering them beyond recognition. Without a doubt the worst Christmas CD I have ever heard."
3,more than just vitamin e...,I wanted pure vitamin e oil. This is not. Smells good. Absorbs fast. Just not pure. Vitamin e is like the fifth ingredient.
1,Read the ingredients before purchasing,"Unfortunately there is quite a bit more than vitamin e oil in this product. A LOT more. For example, sunflower oil? I don't have sensitive skin but this made me break out horribly and gave me a nasty case of hives. You're much better off buying vitamin e oil at Trader Joe's, they sell a 4 oz bottle for $3.99, and it has much fewer extra ingredients."
1,This harmed my face...but not permanently,"I used this product twice on my face and both times, areas of my face broke out in painful red blotches. My eyes got red and puffy. A person in a local heath food store said that these are not the best products. I do not recommend this, especially not on your face."
1,Not True Vitamin E Oil,"FOR THOSE INTERESTED, THE LISTED INGREDIENTS ARE: Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil*, Carthamus tinctorius (Safflower) See Oil*, TocoPheryl Acetate, Tochpherol, Oryza Sativa (Rice), Bran Oil, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Prunus Armeniaca (Apricot) Kernal Oil, Persea Gratissima (Avacado) Oil, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Oil, Lecithin. *Certified Organic Ingredients.As quoted: ""If you prefer all-natural supplements, you can tell the difference by checking the label. Products that contain vitamin E from natural sources will state that they contain d-alpha-tocopherol. Synthetic vitamin E is dl-alpha-tocopherol."" As you CAN SEE, NEITHER ARE LISTED IN THE INGREDIENTS OF THIS PRODUCT. One REALLY DOES NEED TO RESEARCH BEFORE BUYING.I will be finding a different vendor for my Vitamin E, too!Read more:[...]"
2,Yucky Smell!,"I'm surprised nobody is talking about the smell of this oil. I'm super sensitive to odors, and the minute I opened the bottle, I was sorry I ordered it. I would describe it for you, but I've never smelled anything like it, sort of cheap perfumy, like those car deodorizers people hang from their mirrors......or that smell that hits you when you walk into a public restroom. I don't want to use it on my face or anywhere that I can smell it, though the scent does dissipate fairly quickly.Why would they want to add a scent? I thought ""Jason"" products were all about being natural. Pure vitamin E isn't the greatest scent in the world, but I'd much rather they hadn't tried to mask it.I gave it 2 stars because it's a nice enough texture, and I'll probably use it, or at least keep it until it's too rancid, but I won't purchase again."
3,awful packaging,"The oil is okay, not as rich with vitamin E as I had hoped with sunflower and safflower oils the first ingredients. It arrived with the lid not sealed and I had an oily mess everywhere. I find it almost impossible to use the way it is packaged. AOL told me to contact the vendor which I did with no success as they told me to contact AOL....I persisted with AOL and finally got a credit after many hours of frustration on the phone."
3,Beware it's synthetic Vit E,I bought this after a recent neck surgery for the scar. Whether it worked or not is difficult to say as I am a quick healer. However after doing some research albeit a bit late I was disturbed to learn that Jason admits to using synthetic Vitamin E oil in this product. I became suspicious when they didn't mention whether it was D or DL Tocopheryl. So much for 95% organic. You can read the story at the below link.[...]
1,HIghly displeased,"The ingredient listed for this item is ""vitamin E oil"", so I purchased it. My youngest child has severe allergies and one of the reasons I only buy products with known ingredients.This item, once received, proved to not be comprised solely of vitamin E oil, but to contain the following ingredients, which I am listing below.Ingredients: Tocopheryl acetate, helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil*, carthamus tinctorius (safflower) seed oil*, borago officinalis seed oil, camellia sinensis leaf oil, macadamia temifolia seed oil, oenothera biennis (evening primrose) oil, ribes nigrum (black currant) seed oil.I was very disappointed by the listing of only vitamin E oil, as opposed to an honest listing of all the ingredients.Will not purchase again."
2,Contains almond oil,"I am allergic to both almonds and apricots. This product is advertised as ""Pure vitamin E"" with no ingredients list. I take vitamin E and have used vitamin E oil before, and never have I seen one containing almond and apricot oils. I am SOOOO glad I read the ingredients. I almost didn't, didn't occur to me that I needed to, but as the bath was filing, I turned it around and read it. Just goes to show that one should always, always be careful when dealing with allergies. Needless to say, I'm relived that I read the ingredients and disappointed that this wasn't listed anywhere on the Amazon site. Many people are allergic to nuts. This product is going in the garbage."
1,not vitamin E,"I was so angry when I received this product in the mail and found out that it was no pure vitamin E. Under ingredients on the website it only lists vitamin E, but on the bottle there are at least 5 different oils. what a piece of junk!"
4,kinda greasy,"Greasy, smells like almonds, but absorbs pretty well.We use it on our face and any scars after bath.Only real complaint is my little girls hair gets stringy/oily around her face after putting it on her.Nice scent, though. Like sweet almonds.I'll be buying it again. Can tell a difference in just a few weeks."
5,"great information, terrific photographs","This small but information-packed guide is the best I've found for detailed, practical advice about viewing and caring for these little flying jewels. The photographs are breathtaking and the text is well-written and filled with wonderful advice and tips about feeders, habitat, gardens, identification and further resources.Terrific."
1,CAT cd is what you'll get,"My bunnies loved the old Rabbit cd. Which is why I wanted another one since it seems to be lost somewhere. Sadly, even though I ordered the Rabbit cd from Eden's Closet Treasures, I received the Cat one. I see others have had the same problem. Considering the hyped up cost... I call it misrepresentation of product. In other words stealing. I expect a full refund. Now when do I get paid for my time wasted on this nonsense?"
1,Keep getting the Cat CD instead...sad,"When I saw this product and read the reviews I was really excited to get it for my bunnies, but when it arrived in the mail it was the CAT CD. I was disappointed and exchanged it for another Bunny CD, but when it came in the mail it was another CAT CD! I sent it back to try one last time to get the Bunny CD, but I'm not holding out much hope. Too bad, it sounds like something my bunnies would have enjoyed."
1,Deceiving Listing,"This is listed as 140 double snelled hooks and showed 7 different sizes so I assumed that I would be getting about 20 of each hook size. However, all I received was one pack of size 8 miniature hooks with only 6 hooks in it. Complete rip off. Why the hell would I pay over a dollar a piece for a few size 8 hooks. I could have gone to my local tackle shop and picked up a variety pack of over 100 for less than 10 bucks. This was intentionally listed that way just to deceive the buyer. Needless to say I will not be purchasing anything from Red's Gear ever again! Steer clear of this vendor!"
2,Don't hold up well,"I've had two of these for over two years and they really didn't live up to expectations. When new, they looked great but any seat adjustment leaves permanent scratches on the wood and now they look really beat up. The screws fall out frequently and need to be tightened often. The cushions are stained and worn-out after numerous washes. The trays, while we were using them, could never be set completing straight so cups and plates would slide off constantly making for even messier meals than you'd normally expect with a baby/toddler. Also these chairs are really difficult to clean. The food gets stuck in all of the hard-to-reach places so they look pretty disgusting on close inspection. Overall, I'd definitely look for a different option if I were buying one now."
5,Totally Awesome!,"this workout is great! it is fast-paced. if you have sweatin' to the oldies 1-4, then you know that 1&2 are a little slower, 3&4 are faster. this one is much like sweatin' 3&4. if you are used to those, this is similar, with awesome 80's music! enjoy! =)"
4,You will get a work out,"I have the ""Sweatin to the Oldies"" one and wanted something new from Simmons. I like all his workouts. This is a little more fast pace than his other workouts that I have. I like it, it does the job. and I am bouncing all over the place. The songs are great, brings me back to the 80's."
5,Simply Amazing,"The world of Irish music is blessed to have such a great composition of folk tunes. I was taken away with the melodies, vocals, and who can forget, the accordion. Honestly, this is a CD that you will listen to over and over again. This CD really gives the listener a taste for Irealand and even bring them there. The songs featured on this CD arn't the Cheesy Irish songs that you may here over and over again, in other words 'Irish eyes may not be smiling,' but this CD will make you feel right at ""Home."""
5,Great Album,"Ian can do it all. Ian writes the best intros in rock n' roll, and this is no exception. The opening drum beat in ""Just Another Night"" kicks off a great album. Of course he has ample support from Mick Ronson and the E Street Band. But it all comes down to Ian writing great songs. He has a unique sound as well. He sings like nobody else. He rocks on ""Cleveland Rocks"", and soars on ""Ships"". Forget Barry Manilow, ""Ships"" is a beautiful ballad about Ian's relationship with his father. It's great music... period. It's a great album."
5,Ian Hunter's Magnum Opus.,"In 1979 former Mott The Hoople lead man Ian Hunter released ""You're Never Alone With a Schizophrenic"". The album is easily his greatest work and quite possibly the most overlooked rock n roll album ever made. There is no filler with this package. The song ""Just Another Night"" received decent radio airplay on most AOR radio stations which helped give Ian some long overdue recognition. This cd just rocks with tunes like ""Cleveland Rocks""[His Overnight Angels album has a european version England Rocks]. I can't say enough about the quality of the songs like ""Wild East"", ""Bastard"", ""Standin In My Light"" and the fantastic ballad ""Ships""[Barry Manilow had a big hit with it, but Ian's version blows Manilow's out of the water]. If you like well played rock n roll and have not heard any of Ian Hunter's work I guarantee this cd will turn you into one of his fans. His most recent release ""Rant"" proves Ian Hunter has not lost his touch."
1,sorry to say.......,"I love kid party books. This book was a big disappointment. I'm trying to plan a pirate party for my boys next birthday.sooo..... in the table of contents it says pirate party ...but all it shows is a great invite and how to dress up for a pirate party. I don't want the kids to dreass up on a hot day in costumes. This book was too vauge. I wont more game ideas.... decor ideas.It would better for Halloween, it has so many costume ideas. It has great pictures,but nothing original for parties. What a big fat Bummer. I wanted to return the book. I kept it, since I have so many books, just to add to my reference collection. Th pirate invite was cute.. But that is about it. don't bother buying this one if you want new creative ideas this one is a dud. Don't bother. Sorry to say...."
2,Eh.,"I bought this at a serious discount from the Clearance racks of a discount department store. Goodness, I'm glad I didn't pay full price. This book hits all the main requirements of a good cookbook: it opens nice a flat, it has pictures of every recipe, and it even includes measurements in ounces, litres AND cups for all its ingredients.Such a pity that the recipes are all either incredibly difficult to manage, or just don't taste good or look appetizing!Ah well. If nothing else, the essays sprinkled throughout the book (like so much chocolate-flavored jimmies) are informative and interesting. I suppose it was worth the few dollars I spent on it, but I very rarely actually make anything out of it."
3,"Fly Mar, reps Hunters Point SF","Those of you who know about mid 1990s rap coming out of Hunters Point SF maybe heard of Fly Mar. Not one of my favorits, only because this album didnt bring that one certtin thing to make it stand out a bit more among the reat, especially form the mob-era which almost every album had a style of it's own. This is a classic, and it's part of my library. The one thing that does stand out is this ablum is not straight gangsta, it's more of a balanced hip-hop album. Almost constructed with an East Coast style but Mar hollers Hunters Point. Maybe Mar wanted to be differnt his way, like Dee-Mack said on Dee-Mack album, ""doin it my my"" well... Mar did it his way too. Mar even did a song for his daughters on this album which was highly unusual doin so back then."
4,An well-written historical novel about Henry Morgan.,"Henry Morgan, the buccaneer-turned governor of Jamaica, begins this epic journey in his homeland of Wales. From his Welsh roots and escape from prison there, to Jamaica and his life as the ruler of an island nation, Henry Morgan lived hard, but fair. The writer entwines history, romance, and adventure to make this a very worthwhile read."
1,Three Rivers shirts,This was absolutely the worst service I have ever had from your stable of vendors. From date of order to receipt of my shirst was three weeks. The vendor PPS (Presentation Products & Solutions Apparel}neverresponded to my e-mail or phone inquiries. BAD BAD BAD. Thanks for asking. Thomas B. Wie
5,The best cop series of the 70's,"I have collected all four seasons of The Streets of San Francisco. It was the best cop show of the 70's. The stars Karl Malden, a veteran actor and Michael Douglas an up and coming star make a fantastic duo as Stone and Keller, SFPD homocide investigators.As a retired cop from the 80's who grew up watching this show every week , I really enjoy watching it years later without commercial interruption. The many guest actors were always great from Bill Bixby to Mark Hamill to Paul Sorvino. The film quality is great too. Much better than it was when I was watching it via a rooftop antenna! If you are a fan of 70's cop shows this one is a must have."
3,Streets of San Francisco,"On Season Four, Volume One, Disc one, I can't play the 4th episode. It keeps freezing, and I have trouble getting the disc out of the DVD Player !"
3,Season 4 Vol 2,"Season 4 Vol 2 has a serious flaw. You have to listen to the complete opening music, before you can access the menu. This is unacceptable and this is the first time I have ever seen this on a DVD set. A review for a MOD release for Cannon said don't buy this due to the picture quality, however some commercial releases are not any better. One episode on the last disc of Vol 2 was watchable but CBS chose a less than good quality source."
3,No Complaints,I ordered this as my son picked it out for his Birthday cake. It was exactly what I ordered and it arrived with instructions for creating the exact picture of the cake shown. there was nothing wrong with it and it didnt take an extremely long time to arrive. overall satisfied.
2,Poor,"Very incomplete.e.g., the section on nouns mentions declensions, but neither defines nor enumerates the declension.The imperfect tense is shown, but the difference between imperfect and past tenses is not mentioned.Pronunciation (which definitely affects the grammar, e.g., the -f- of the future tense) is ignored (outside of the distinction between slender and broad consonants).Don't waste your money."
3,A Good Basic Book.......,"I am a real estate agent/investor. I found that the book contained a lot of information that is out dated, specifically non-qualifying assumable loans (they stopped being assumable in 1987). I did however, appreciate the information about incorporating and the tax breaks associated with selling and holding the mortgage. I was looking for a book with more meat, more detail, but this a basic real estate investment book."
1,out of date and legally questionable.,"This book may have been helpful in the past, but it really fails to address the legal pitfalls of using a wrap around mortgage with a due on sale clause, which is pretty much every mortgage written since the early 1980s. If someone transfers any interest without telling the bank, the whole mortgage could be called with 30 days notice. This might be ok if mortgage rates are falling, particularly if the buyer has good credit, but if that's the case, why wouldn't they want a new mortgage at a lower rate? If mortgage rates are rising, and the credit risks don't match current lending criteria (which is the case with lots of marginal borrowers when money is tightening), you could lose everything.I realize Mr. Cook doesn't want to face litigation for giving specific advice, but its really quite pointless to buy this book."
5,The all time classic that still kicks,"Real Estate Money Machine is ideal for investors who want the wealth of rel estate without the three t's of tenants, toilets and turnover.This book is one of the reasons that I am free to travel without being encumbered with a job, problem tenantsor a lack of cash flow.Read this book first, then go to Real Estate for Real People."
3,"Book provides broad strategy, but few details","Wade Cook provides only an overly-broad stategy, but provides few details. For example, he talks constantly about ""making the offer"" on a property,but never shows an example of what any of his allegedly simple offer contracts looks like. Also, his strategy calls for buying houses needing only minimal ""cosmetic"" repairs. Such houses are not likely to be substantially below market price, so your small profit margin after fix-up could easily be wiped out by your selling costs and commissions."
3,"Fake, Cheesy, Gory, FUN!","This movie is a total ripoff from the Carnosaur series. About 70% of the movie is scenes from the Carnosaur movies! However, this movie is fun to watch and is very funny. I mean, about two minutes into the movie and the dinosaurs are tearing people to shreads! This movies has tons of blood and gore, and fake looking dinosaurs. But if you are an open minded movie watcher looking for some low budget, cheesy fun, Raptor is for you!"
3,Goofy,This is one goofy movie.The raptor monsters look like people who are running around in rubber suits. In fact as I think about that's probably what they are.The writing has a similar quality.Still if you've got nothing better to do on a Saturday afternoon you might enjoy it.Jeff MarzanoSnakehead TerrorSpiders II: Breeding GroundRaptor Island
3,"""Great"" if you like bad movies","My friends and I rented this movie on a whim in college with the hopes of seeing a really bad movie. Our expectations were sufficiently exceeded. For people who get genuine enjoyment out of the occasional terrible movie, there's always the risk of finding a flick that's just plain bad without crossing the line of ""so bad it's good."" Raptor crosses that line with gusto--using awful and nonsensical stock footage, having a provocatively dressed, porn-star looking forensics expert main character, delivering one-liners that are about as witty as a piece of broccoli, etc--and even throws in some legitimately famous people (as legitimate as you're gonna get for a movie like this) for good measure.As a serious film, Raptor obviously doesn't deserve a single star. But purely as laughable entertainment, it's one of my favorites."
1,Corman is losing it,"Roger Corman has produced a film that rips off his prior dinosaur films. The film is mindless, with characters appearing solely to be placed in the same situations from previous movies, just so old footage can be recycled.(...) It's sad that a guy with so much talent puts his name on films like this. He's ruining (ruined) his legacy.If there's one film you shouldn't buy or rent, stay away from this for the mere fact that the content is so bad."
1,Raptors?,"It is sooo lame! In the begining you see the raptors! You should not see the killers until at 30 minutes of the movie! It's just seeing people being alone then getting ripped apart! I stopped watching after 18 minutes. I figgered once you've seen one guy die you've seen the movie! People who have not seen jurassic park 1,2,and 3 seem to like this movie! Jurassic park is soooo much better! Rent it if you must see it!"
3,It's Carnosaur 4 with a new title,"Another reviewer thought Corman was ripping off his own Carnosaur series.Fact is they'd announced production of Carnosaur 4.This film is obviously it.Coincidently it's the second 2001 kaiju to get re-titled with an ""R"" title that just makes it harder to find if you were looking for it.The other is Yongarry 2001(the special edition of Yongarry 1999) which was re-titled REPTILIAN.The entire Carnosaur series has the dubious distinction of placing good actors in mediocre scripts and lowering the quality of the dinosaur FX in each sequel.Someone must have thought distancing this one from the series might get it a bigger audience.It's a shame Corman got the rights to the novel this series is based on.It could have made one great movie instead of four ""golden turkeys"".To RAPTOR's credit this cast does a better job with this script than JP3's cast could do with that one."
1,Raptor The Matchwork Movie.,"This is the most disgusting piece of movie directing & editing it has been my misfortune to see. Several scenes from the movie Carnosaur 2 are spliced into this one. Talk about creatively dead! DON'T buy this movie, burn your money you will enjoy it more."
2,SPLICE AND DICE,"RAPTOR is a collection of scenes spliced from the three previous CARNOSAUR movies, and that in itself loses the movie at least two stars!!!THE STORY: Banal and derivative, incoherent, and since it uses so much footage from the above mentioned movies, how can one judge this script on its own?THE DIRECTION: Tepid and unimaginative.THE CAST: Tim Abell was the only one I enjoyed in this movie; his supermacho Delta Force leader was the only life like performance. Teresa DePriest can't act; Corbin Bernsen overacts; and Eric Roberts and Melissa Brasselle are zombielike.OTHER ASPECTS: The music by James Horner (why would this future oscar winner even do this?) It's banal at best. The special effects are mediocre, and the movie's climax rips off the third Carnosaur movie so blatantly, it's abysmal.Shame on Roger Corman for stooping so low.The two stars are mainly for Tim Abell!!!"
4,Easy to use,"We love these things. They are super easy to use and wash in the machine. The only thing is that I don't agree with the sizing. When our daughter should have fit in the ""small"" according to Kiddopotamus, she was actually still in the ""preemie"". When she should have been in the ""large"", she was still in the ""small"". Otherwise, we loved this thing and have bought them as gifts for friends with infants."
5,"map lovers, look out!","this is truly an extraordinary book, with excellent reproductions of all types of maps. the index provides the original map dimensions, which i found helpful. this book would be a great additional to any library, young or old."
4,Good Value,"This scope is of good quality, and at its price, it turns out to be good value.The image is bright even in low light, the eye relief is reasonable (even if not quite as advertised), and the focusing mechanism works smoothly with no backlash. The included tripod is much higher quality than usually comes with this range of scope."
2,Poor Book,The book is so poorly printed that its almost unreadable. Did not have any of the information on the Brownells that I was searching for.
5,Another Morricone Masterpiece,"Once Apon a Time in The West...have you seen the movie? Have you ever heard of this movie? If you are a 'western' freak, a spaggetti western tragic, a serious film student or immersed in popular cultural history it is hard to imagine how powerfull Sergio Leone's westerns would have been without the creative magic of Morricone's musical soundtracks.Putting an accurate finger on the pulse of these gems is not easy.If you are connected to where music can take you......go along for this ride.I've seen recently that Morricone is touring...performing these tracks.Catch him while you can."
3,Are you sure about the author?,"Will You Die For Me? The Man Who Killed For Charles Manson Tells His Own StoryIn the More About the Author section it seems to describe a respected neurobiologist, teacher, and scientist who has written 14 books over the last 25 years. Doesn't sound like Tex Watson at all."
3,my thoughts on book,"very good read , couldnt put it down once i started . not much new information but sheads light on his past"
4,Fascinating,"I read this long ago. It was an honest account of how someone could go from seemingly normal guy to a mindless killer. He was at least honest enough to admit that he was the one who killed all of the victims even though others had taken claim for some of them.The murder of Sharon is told without too much gore, but its still chilling. There is even one humorous part of the book. I recommend looking for it online or in your library system."
1,Like Susan Atkins -- a Hypocrite,"The ""handsome and gregarious"" Mr. Watson hasn't lost his ability to pull the wool over a lot of people's eyes. Whether his drug is Charles Manson or God, this loser is still as self-serving as he was 35 years ago -- only now he has the nerve to suggest he's morally superior to the families of the victims, just because he's learned how to forgive himself. Susan Atkins manipulates people the same way. Thank God the parole board has more common sense than readers who believe this..."
1,TEX WATSON'S WILL GIVE YOU THIS BOOK- SO LET HIM,SINCE HE OFFERS TO GIVE THIS BOOK TO ANYONE WHO ASKS AT NO COST [TO THEM AT LEAST] WHY NOT LET TEX WATSON PAY A LITTLE MORE RATHER THAN REWARD HIM FOR JUST TELLING THE LITTLE HE HAS ABOUT WHAT HE DID WHEN HE KILLED SHARON TATE AND THE OTHERS? HIS CHURCH IS CALLED ALMS AND THEIR PAGE ON THE WEB MAILS IT TO THOSE WHO ASK- WITH OR WITHOUT A DONATION. ID RATHER SEE HIM PAY TO HAVE PEOPLE HEAR WHAT HE HAS TO SAY THAN THEM :)
5,Painfully Beautiful,"I found Criterion's blu-ray release of Last Year at Marienbad painful to watch. I paused it numerous times and found it hard to pick up. After watching some other movies, I realized why. This movie has no wasted frames, no time for the viewer to space out or let their attention wander. Every frame is beautifully composed and shot, every frame adds to the story, and every frame contributes to the director's reflection on the nature of human memory. Some scenes are simultaneously still and in motion, while others are in motion and still. And this is all the more amazing because there is no natural beauty in the movie. All the beauty in this film is artificial, uncomfortable, posed, man-made beauty, even the outside shots. Wow. I'm not sure I could watch it again, but it's hard to imagine that any movie could top this one. I'd give it 6/5 stars if Amazon would let me."
1,Pretentious and pompous,"I expect a story in a movie, and recognizable human beings--unless it's a symbolical piece, and then i expect some meaning. The movie pretends to say or do something profound but i am not able to discover it. I join those who compare the movie to the king's new clothes. As are as i am concerned, the king is naked and the weavers are con artists."
3,Why see this film?,"This is without a doubt the most impenetrable film ever made. There is no plot, and we see over and over again the same action. A visual Steve Reich piece. A must see for all serious film buffs, just to say you have done it. You must stay to the end."
5,masterpiece,This film gets better with every viewing. Has anyone figured out the game? Delphine Seyrig is always great. Best film ever from Alain Resnais.
5,Strange...Beautiful,Foreign movies...not for everybody...and I'am not usually a fan myself---but this is a real gem. It makes sense to buy this because it's a film you can really watch several times--its really quite like a painting moving across your screen--it pulls you into another world. The dialogue and plot really don't matter...your own psyche will take over.
1,Watch out - very poor quality VHS dub!,"This review is not about the film, ""Last Year at Marienbad"", which I consider a classic, but rather the horrible technical quality of this tape.I ordered the VHS version of ""Marienbad"" because the DVD is evidently out of print, and the cheapest DVD price on Amazon is currently about $300 (!)I wouldn't mind it if this tape was merely VHS quality, but it's not -- it's so horrible as to be almost unwatchable. It looks like a bootleg copy made with cheap equipment by people who have no idea what they're doing and no concern about quality.The beginning of the film has out-of-synch, snowy, grainy images which keep fading in and out, making it impossible to tell what's going on. Later, the quality ""improves"", but is still worse than a VHS dub made on home equipment.Buyer beware -- you get what you pay for!"
2,overrated film by the usually excellent Resais,"what a snooze!I bought this film when I read all of the great reviews. Also, I loved ""Hiroshima, Mon Amour"" and ""J'tme J'tme"" and find Resnais familiar themes of memory and repetition interesting.But ""last Year at Marienbad"" was a letdown. It's just too vague (even for Resnais!!). It's never clear what is going on. Even the mood is vague. The film never weaves a tight enough atmosphere to sustain the expressionism.It took me three sitting to get through the entire film and I ended up fast forwarding through the last twenty minutes. What a bore!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Last Year at MarienBAD,"This is a perfect example of why French films are often made fun of. This film is pretentious and boring. From it's ridiculously over the top wax poetic voice over to it's annoying organ music, it claws at you with its ""hey, look at me!"" style. The only thing going for it is the lovely location and decor, but that wasn't enough to keep my interest beyond 20 minutes. That's when I turned it off. I love watching foreign films and I give every film a chance, but this one isn't my cup of tea.On a positive note, the Criterion blu-ray transfer is excellent."
2,So-so transfer. Get the Criterion Collection version instead!,"This out of print (and way overpriced!) Fox Lorber DVD is non-anamorphic and not terribly sharp looking. It was watchable when it came out years ago, but it's terribly dated by today's standards. The remastered Criterion Collection DVD will be coming out in June 2009, as will their Blu-ray edition. Save your money and wait!"
1,Quel dommage!,"In Alain Resnais' 1961 feature there is A, X et M posing in decontructionist metaphors a Chanel.Whether the movie has to do with ""The Invention of Morel"", the anthropological archetypes of Claude Levi-Strauss or whether or not it is a French or Italian film is meaningless.Because, whatever angle you take, it just doesn't matter."
1,If you can't remember who you had sex with last year,"I saw this movie several times when it came out. I remember some scenes. If you can't remember if you did or did not have an affair with someone the year before at a fashionable spa, this is for you. I write this because I am watching another of his films and am experiencing deja vu, all over again."
1,What the hell is going on?,"I decided to get this movie because the plot sounded interesting and most people gave it rave reviews. From the moment I pushed play I had no idea what was going on. This dramatic instrumental music that didn't fit with some of the scenes gave me a major headache, but I kept watching, hoping the movie would get, I don't know, normal, I guess. It didn't. Supposedly, this film has great cinematography...again, it just gave me a headache. By the time the movie was done, I still knew nothing about the characters, and I felt like I was having an anxiety attack!"
1,Again and Again this WONT END!,"I can tell you only one thing today, I tried watching this for 35 minutes and it was the worst 35 minutes of my like. This is not a drama, This is a bore. You never seen anything like it, is the words perfectly. They could make this movie any worse. I heard god aweful organ music for most of my 35 minute sit thru this. The game they play in parts of the movie leaves me wondering if anyone making this film knew where the plot was.I unlike some souls came down here at the 35 minute marker and began reading.Warning: This movie is no good. Boring doesn't begin to describe this. I love dramas and really like those mental movies too, but this never goes there.Heres the scene names:The Mournful Mansion, The Game: M Wins, In the Gardens at Frederiksbad, Meeting Again and Again, When I Came to Your Room, M Questions You, Our Agreement,Together at last.Those titles speak volumes for how boring this is."
1,don't use this as a guide for the broad head I got the wrong product,not sure how they work because I only got replacement blades. only giving a one because they sent the wrong product. use this as a
5,A great first step to Einstein's relativity,"Wow! This is an awesome little book. I love the ""Introducing"" series but sometimes I find their work a little too basic. Not this time. This is a graphic highway into the mind of Einstein - the 4th dimension, curved space and time...its all here but without the maths...just the ideas. The middle is the hardest, while the last third of the book covers current cosmology and all the latest advances in our understanding of the universe."
2,I went in dumb and...,"... came out dumb too.I'm usually the first in line when there's Weighty Knowledge to be had on the cheap, and there ain't much that's toting a heavier load than Einstein's Theory of Relativity. So, skinny book + cartoons on every page + minimal text = Smart Me. Oh, happy day.I was doing okay up until the two crows that looked kind of like Heckle and Jeckle showed up. Look, you can throw all the cute pictures you got but they aren't going to get me any closer to understanding geodesics and metrics. And that was just the crows! The chimp with the egg beater was pushing tensors and the gorillas with the pointy sticks were trying to explain vectors. Sorry. From the birds on I was absorbing what the authors were throwing at me about as well as a concrete wall absorbs tennis balls.I like the idea of presenting complex topics in a graphic-text format. Unfortunately, I think this topic needs quite a bit more text and (gulp) an in-depth explanation of the math behind it all."
4,Discipline/Madness in inspiring/frightening,"This book will definately affect you. It will either repulse you with its graphic nature, or make you inspired by the discipline that is shown by the ""military"" couple. I think what they did was messed up, but one has to admire the discipline and fortitude it took to carry out one's convictions in such a calculated manner. I recommend this book for seekers of discipline."
4,Excellent imagery,"Mishima's imagery is as beautiful as ever, however I find that he tries to over-romanticize the suicide - almost to the point of making it seem comic or cliche. His description (or at least that of the translator's) is excellent and gripping. This is definately worth a read - a fairly unknown classic. Probably not much insight into Japanese culture, however you may get some insight into the character of Mishima himself, who ended his life in the same way as the main character..."
1,riddled with typos!,"The new 2010 ""Pearls"" edition of Patriotism is so full of typos I wanted to cut my own stomach out. There's no excuse for these mistakes. It took me no more than 40 minutes to read the entire story and it's a shame New Directions couldn't take the time to do so before they sent this thing to press. For example: a sentence that is supposed to read ""her socks were no longer sticky with blood"" says ""her sucks were no longer sticky with blood."" Completely appalling stuff--I'll be skipping all the ""Pearls"" from here on out."
1,book arrived damaged,This is a thin book and it was shipped in just a padded envelope. It arrived practically bent in half.
4,McMillion gets high marks for this CD,"As the previous reviewer stated, it is no secret that Dan is a big Maynard Ferguson fan. One look at the charts he records and it is clear to any MF fan that Dan pays tribute to ""The Fox"" on every CD he releases. But what distinguishes this release from all the rest of Dan's is that the band is tighter than usual, bringing a lot of verve and fire to the charts they perform. This is one of my top two McMillion releases. If you like big band jazz and want to see what Dan mcMillion is all about, start with this CD (or FIRESHAKER, if you can find one!)."
5,Barbie does Jamestown!,"Combine your love of Barbie and colonial history with this wonderful ""fashion baby"" that pre-teens and adults will adore. Mine is in an honored spot on my bookshelf, holding court next to Colonial Barbie. She is a treasure!"
2,undone,i would just like to say that diane's recipies are not my personal favorites but whatever that marielle woman has to say is probably untrue. that was rude.
1,"If you want a good recipie, don't look here","I bought this book knowing that I loved American cuisine. Even reading the first recipie was dissappointing. Cooking it was definately not a thrill, as the instructions were quite unclear. The net result was terrible, and I'm not a bad cook. If you know what's good for you, you won't buy this book, it was extremely unhelpful."
5,My two year old loves her Ann Coulter Doll,This the perfect toy to help keep your daughter on the RIGHT path in life. Who better than Ann to teach your daughter how to talk to a liberal.
4,TWILIGHT ZONE for kids,"This is the TWILIGHT ZONE for kids... with young teens menaced by the supernatural...though usually with a not-so-subtle moral to the story. MY NAME IS EVIL is the best of this bunch...though they are all good, intelligent fun for the 16 and younger set."
3,The Nightmare room: scareful what you wish for,"Reese out of malcolm in the middle gives a good performance( a suttle difference from his character on the show.) Its entertaining, enough to keep you awake. One of the better R.L. Stine screenings. Stars Justin Berfield from Malcolm in the Middle and 'Sting' from WCW wrestling."
2,Lackluster,"Had five.bolt.main's release been issued 5 years ago, I may have been a bit more generous with my stars, but in today's world of 'good is not enough' record releases, i can't. Bands are being pressured right and left to make better records, no fillers allowed. Sadly, the bulk of ""venting"" is indeed filler. First single, ""the gift"" is actually pretty good, with slick verses and a good hook. After that though, things seem to fall apart. There are some standouts few and far beyond, but not enough to keep me interested. It's no wonder why almost no buzz has surrounded this record. I wouldn't pick this one up unless you're a diehard fan of the late band flaw. Not recommended."
4,Awe Inspiring,"This Cd made miss Flaw, singer Chris Volz former band. Flaw was a band that should have made it big in the world of hard rock, but both their albums, ""Through the Eyes"" and ""Endangered Species"" both scanned under 50,000 units, and the band broke up in frusteration.Now, Chris volz is back, and in as good as shape as ever. Musically, the band is very reminsicent of Flaw, with Chris tackling the same subjects as he ded with his former band. His lyrics are still pissed and raging, but also very sad and sowerful. Some of his songs made me realize that i'm not all alone in the way that i feel sometimes. A very inspirational band and singer, all in all. Check e m out. You wont be sorry"
1,Terrible disppointment,"Just a bunch of newspaper quotes with no text written about him or by him. The beautiful cover is the best part, so it makes a nice display piece. Jimmy, if you're reading this, why didn't you help out the poor ""author"" so you'd both have something to be proud of?"
1,Not even if you're a big Jimmy Johnson fan!,"This book is nothing more then a collection of opinions about Jimmy and his philosophies on life, football, family, and friends. Don't waste your money on this one. If my young daughter hadn't ripped the first page I would have surely sent it back!"
3,Not as good as most other Cranium products,"I purchased this product for a long (read 20 hour) car trip. I wanted something other than DVDs to keep our 5 & 7 year old busy. This is not a toy I would recommend for the car. (I also purchased a Cranium Wonder Works Super Recorder and I would give it 5+ stars - highly recommended!) The 7 year old could work the recorder ok...but as other reviewers stated, there just isn't enough time to speak. The eraser and the markers constantly pop out and fall on the floor and then you hear ""MOM..."". Not much you can do about it when you are driving. The stickers will not stay on the paper in the book, but hey, they made great window decorations. If you do purchase this product for travel - one word of warning. I think the package said batteries included, but they are for demonstration only. The batteries gave way quickly - good thing to replace them before use, or take some backups."
1,Disappointing Toy! Buyer beware.,"I just gave this to my 7-year-old daughter for hanukkah. She was very excited as she loves to make up stories and draw. She immediately began playing with the toy and ended up in tears. The pens don't work well on the pages--the ink doesn't stick and the stickers don't adhere well so when you try to turn the page to work on another one, the stickers all fall off. We never even made it to the recording. It's going back to the store tomorrow."
3,a bit disappointing,The idea is great but the product is just ok. I was surprised how little time they give the child to talk per page. Children talk and talk and talk when telling a story. There may only be 10 seconds a page of allocated record time. That is not enough. I tried it first to show my child what to do and I kept getting cut off and I was speaking so fast.
3,Nice idea!,"My daughter received this as a Christmas present and she loved the idea of it. But I have to agree..the record time isn't near long enough,she was frustrated it cut off so soon, you may get a sentence or 2 at best out before it stops recording. How many stories do you know that ends in 2 sentences! The markers are terrible. The stickers seem to do ok, overall it's a great concept but still needs some fine tuning."
3,Not a good mix for me,"I happen to really enjoy (a lot of) Disney Christmas music, but those are the older songs they did years ago. In those collections there was a nice mix of children's songs and some that were adult focused.This CD tries to fill in with trendy cultural themes that I believe level the meaning of Christmas, if only in the more joyful aspects of it.Frankly, listening to it was not an experience for me that I would want to repeat, although it did mix in some of the older versions that I kind of grew up with.I gave it to my granddaughter and she likes it but that doesn't alter how I choose to rate it."
4,music in the bath,"My 2-1/2 year old son likes these flutes, for making noise and for playing with sinking and floating. They are fun colors, seem pretty durable and I think he'll continue to get more out of them as he develops a little more patience. I like the plastic sheet music that stick to the tub tiles!"
3,just OK,I bought the water flutes for my 2.5 year old daughter because thay had pretty good reviews. She's not crazy about them at all. Manufacturer suggests it's for kids 3+ so maybe she just needs to grow to like them.
5,Smart and fun toy,What a good toy.It is fun.But it also teach your kids some physics and some musics.Outstanding.They love itAnd keep playing with it 6 months later.Really a good product.
4,Fun toy in or out of the bath,"My daughter absolutely loves this toy, the holder itself is fairly useless except for packaging but the actual flutes are pretty nice and have surprising decent sound for a children's toy. The product is solid enough to stand up to my daughters rough play and works well, but make sure you are emptying them out after usage."
3,"Good for the age range, not any younger","I bought this for my son who really enjoys a harmonica and recorder, but at 27 months, these are beyond him. He does like to bang them on the tub and so far they have held up, but they are not super durable looking. I also don't like that they come apart from the foamy holder so easily. Even when I'm playing with them, carefully handling them, they slip out. I think these are going to go away for about a year, hopefully when they appear again, he can actually play them!"
4,WHISTLE A TUNE,"Out of the four bath toys I purchased for my 3 year old son, this one is of the least interest to him.Despite having filled them up and tried to show him how to play a tune, he just wants to tip the water out and squeal away ear piercingly!! I think it's a toy he will grow into.I don't think they are that easy to manipulate either. The blue holder is a nice idea, but once full of water they don't stand very easily and if they do fall over all the water comes out. Might have been better to have a type of 'stand' to put them in instead of the holder."
1,Not so great,"This fell apart pretty quickly. I guess it's not surprising considering it is a cheap plastic toy, just be fore-warned that it will not last."
1,Not worth the money.,"Two of the tubes leaked immediately. It is not worth the money, and I am sorry that I spent mine."
5,My daughter really enjoys this toy!,"Bought this toy to give to my daughter (6 years old) on Christmas.They are very easy to fill with water, but they do take a bit of filling and dumping to get them tuned correctly. There are tuning marks on the sides of each flute. The tuning is all part of learning music.The music sheets could be a bit larger to contain more of the songs. The music sheets only have a short portion of the song and end before I think they should. The sheets are water proof and they can be hung on the tub walls using water.The only issue we have is that the foam holder is not very tight on the ends and it allows the end flutes to fall out if not held tight enough. Otherwise, my daughter enjoys them very much."
2,Its tub time and Mommy has a headache--again!,Someone meant well buying these and my son truly loves them. Learning how to fill them and understanding the science behind them is truly great. The sound they make seriously gives me a headache whether he is using them appropriately or not. I highly advise if you buy these you plan on them for outdoor use. Also it is easy to accidently suck up water using them by mistake (or intentionally) so if you are going to use them I highly suggest truly non-toxic soap or plain wateer in a clean tub.
2,Too hard to use as intended.,This is great as a set of 5 independent whistles but that is all. Forget about filling them up with the correct amount of water to play anything recognizable. The tubes also too easily fall out of the holder for them.
5,Great for the bath,My kids love this. It's hard to find a toy a 3 year old and a 6 year old both like. But they both enjoy these. And it teaches them about the different tones and sounds of music at the same time. Love this.
2,These were just ok. . .,We've had these since my daughter was 2 (she's 4 now). They are really loud and echo throughout the bathroom which is not much fun for the adult. After she tired of the whistle they just became water receptacles to fill up and dump. She never really cared about making a song or different water levels making different tones. I wouldn't buy this as a gift.
3,Just way too loud,"My daughter(s) got this set of flutes from Grandma for Christmas. It seemed great and i was really excited about it. They are 2 and 4 (almost 5). The concept of different notes is too difficult for them. Even playing the ""music"" by color doesn't quite work. So bathtime has turned into an ear-piercing combination of high-pitch notes from these very loud flutes. I think if I take them outside in the summer time they may be more appropriate. Inside a bathroom when I'm trying to get them bathed is just too crazy."
4,A nice tune.......,I bought these for my son as one of his stocking stuffers this Christmas. He has loved playing with them in the tub. I would think you could use them outdoors in the summer as a water toy. They are well made and it is a really cute idea for kids who love to make music and get clean at the same time. I would recommend these to any parents who don't mind a little bath time music.
3,"Great for kids, annoying for parents","My daughter is nearly 3 years old and really, really enjoys these flutes. She's actually abandoned the blue holder altogether and prefers to fill and play with them one or two at a time. Maybe as she gets older and pays more attention to how much water she's filling the tubes with and tries to play songs it will be less annoying, but for now, this is one of those toys that makes me cringe. It's annoying to listen to loud notes being played in a small bathroom, where sounds reverberates, and I'm constantly cleaning the tubes for fear of mold build up."
5,Great,"I can not complain about this. I didn't keep the holder in the tub with the flutes because I have 2 kids and this way they each get to play with them. My babies are very little and still don't understand that you can vary the sound of the flute based on how much water they are holding, but they love blowing into them and making music."
3,Looks more fun than it is.,"My daughter loves being in the tub, so naturally, we looked at the Alex products and bought quite a few. The flutes do not stay in the blue foam holder at all, and they slip, so they will not stay at the same level either. My daughter can use the flutes individually, which does not help when you want to do a song. If the holder was a snap-in holder, it would be a better product. My husband is going to try and rig something up."
2,REally ear piercing in an echo-ey bathroom,"Not sure what I was thinking when I got these but my 3 year old loves to blow them like the horrible hell whistles that they are as I bathe her in our small, vaulted ceiling bathroom and the result is ear piercing. If you have a echo chamber for a bathroom, think twice."
3,Nice idea - needs tweeking,"Cute toy and idea. However, the foam flute holder does NOT work well. With water in them making them heavier and a wet/slippery foam, the flutes do not stay in place. They slip down and/or out of the foam holder all together. Still, my 2 year old enjoys using them one at a time. As she gets older, it would be neat to be able to use the music cards to play a song...IF the flutes could stay in place. Educationally, even my 2 year old realizes they sound different with various levels of water in each flute. She'll add water, remove it, etc. to see how the sound changes. A nice idea would be to add a edge so it's more evident to younger ages where their mouth should stop in order to blow into the flutes. It's more difficult for a younger child to know they can't cover the top hole or the sound won't come out. A stronger holder, and the lip alteration would simply expand the target age group."
4,Good toy,I got this for my son for Christmas and he loves all the flutes. He will play with them in and out of the tub. Although he doesn't understand that filling them with a certain amount of water will change the tone; he simply likes to carry them around.
2,just another annoying whistle,"I bought this for my 1 and 3 year old. The only use they got out of it was walking around the house blowing in it. They never used it as it should be used, disinterested."
2,Errores de esencia,"El hombre light plantea que la sociedad actual tiene todos sus valores degenerados y plantea como solucion la vuelta a la sociedad del pasado. Sin embargo este analisis es parcial, porque no observa las virtudes de la sociedad moderna y los defectos de las pasadas."
4,Not a bad job,"I had inhibitions about buying this book due to the other reviews, but I've found it extremely helpful. There are plenty of stats regarding the MCATs, GPA and enrollment. Although the descriptions of the curriculae aren't as in depth as I had hoped, it's more than enough to form some initial opinions about the various schools."
3,This book is an excellent source of medical schools.,"Barron's Guide to Medical and Dental Schools is an excellent source for pre-medical, dental, osteopathic students. The authors included prerequistites and admission requirements for most of the programs in the U.S. and Canada. It also offers limited information on foriegn medical schools. Some information is outdated and needs to be revised. Very reasonably priced."
4,Memorable Entertainment,"I first saw this movie back in 1980, when I was in the Peace Corps in Zaire, now the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It seems to follow the standard plot line for this type of film, two brothers who don't know they're brothers. At one point they are adversaries, but upon discovering the truth, the one brother sacrifices himself for the other. However, its the musical numbers which were the memorable part of the movie. The songs were catchy and about the best I've heard from the number of ""Bollywood"" films I've seen. I particularly enjoyed, for lack of a better term, the bird cage number where Rekha swings above the diners in the nightclub."
2,Please someone help this person!,"Shanda's voice isn't too bad, It's slightly better than this album which stinks something awful. Every single song sounds exactly like the one before it. Singer & Songwriter need practice, but I don't like to pay my money for someone else's practice runs.SO... if the singer and writer's family are reading this,leave now.This CD is just really, really bad."
1,There has got to be a better XML book,"This book has no direction at all. The author inserts bits and pieces of info that he has collected about varying topics. Buy this book if you want to learn nothing about alot of XML topics from a MS perspective.I was wading my way through the book skimming the extremely long and irrelavent examples hoping the Windows DNA chapters at the end would make it all worth the pain. Nope - I don't think this guy has ever written an application that used Windows DNA architecture in his life.The best thing about this book is that I didn't have to pay for it. Don't buy it, I am sure Wrox or someone else has a much better XML book."
2,Lack of direction; very dry and boring read.,"Not only did this book fail to provide me with any succinct information with regard to the problems I'm attempting to solve, it was also a very dry and boring read. The author did not present concepts in the order in which one would regularly learn them. Given this, it is highly unlikely that the author has real world development experience.In summary, painful book; purchase at risk to your own mental health. Oh yes, THANKS JAKE STURM."
4,I liked it,Well written with good examples. Through enough but still missing here or there a few examples. For instance I would have loved to see some about schemas.It is a good book to learn about XML unless if you plan to use this book as a reference as well. Then you probably want to use a different book.If you need a good understanding of the DOM again consider reading msdn that should be enough. However if you into developing distributed apps in with Microsoft tools I would recommend spending the money.
5,Great Examples,"With so many XML books currently on the market it was hard to choose a book. I picked this one because of its use of realistic examples. As I read the book I could use the examples to gain insight into the topics being covered. The examples especially made some of the more complicated topics easy to understand. This book is a great tool to learn everything from the basics of XML to the more advanced topics, such as working with the DOM. I am glad that I bought this book; it has really helped me create XML based projects."
3,advanced level,"it is not a starting point. if you did not have any other experience of Tag programming, you may be bored of reading for the first time. plus it has got no editor of XML in CD-ROM. at least it must contain a editor to develop solution."
2,Amount of music,"The sound on this recording is wonderful. One has no problem of appreciating the unique Lucia Popp. The price is very enticing too. The only problem is that the amount of music on all 4 CD's is about 170 minutes, istead of usual 300 minutes these days. This is nearly half the normal length."
2,"For me, do not works...",I had tried several products for prostate inflamation (HBP... hypertrophy benign prostate enlargement) and really NO ONE works... this product is not exception.
2,Average Only,"This was a disappointing performance for me; especially with the recent quality of many concert DVDs. The band simply doesn't appear to have rehearsed that much prior to the performance. That is, the concert, primarily the singing was sloppy in my opinion. In addition, the sound left much to be desired. Indeed, it was the variable that was probably the most disappointing for me. Be cautious before you buy this one."
3,Horrible Mix,"I know that it is a challenge to get music DVD's to sound good playing them on a PC. You have too many factors like the software DVD processing, soundcard processing and a lack of proper bass-management to send the right signal to the speakers. BUT alot of DVD's sound great on my PC played through Philips Acoustic Edge 5.1 soundcard and Klipsch Promedia 5.1 THX speakers...this one DOES NOT.Plus the style of music and the voice of the singer is the type that most people (including me) can't take in large doses. I was weary by the end of the 3rd song."
5,Flawless!,"A previous reviewer must have been watching a different concert than I was. It is a peerless performance all around. Richard Butler has a stage presence that is spellbinding, and I couldn't take my eyes off him. The overall quality is flawless. It only gets better with repeated viewings. A must-have if you're a fan of their music."
3,Good Primer on Large Heart Genetics,"This is a good initial work on large heart genetics. The concepts are easy to understand with enough anecdotal text to ad interest. I was a little disappointed in the format of the index. The contents were good overall but, from my standpoint, I would have loved to have 4 or 5 generation pedigrees on all the Double Copy Mares as well as their produce information as an aid to tracing the Large Heart X-Factor into the pedigrees of my own horses. There are also several mares missing from the double copy list (notably daughters of La Troienne) who are full sisters to DC mares on the list or are by stallions who produced DC mares and by extrapolation are DC mares themselves. This book is a great starting point but I only rated it above average because there is so much more information that, if included, would have resulted in a superior text for the serious breeder. Hope Marianna Haun is writing an additional book to expound on this first work."
5,A real patient/therapist encounter,"What I love about this book is that it takes you into an unspoken territory of patient and therapist. In the same light as a photojournalist goes behind the scenes to capture events; We capture the inside life of both patient and therapist in a moving and human experience. In exchange for money, Dr. Yalom agrees to see Ginny on the basis that they will each write honest and open reports of each session, so he can create this book. We get an inside look into the passion and desire of a therapsit in his faciliatation of change, as well as, a deep look at a struggling patient admitting to her defenses, emotions, and maladaptive behaviors. A wonderful insight into the blossoming of a relationship that will change both therapist and patient. I highly recommend for anyone who is interested in the field of psychology."
3,not the best yalom has to offer...,"this was his book i was most excited to read, and while i think the concept is great, i don't think it really worked. the accounts were often long-winded and dull, and when there were little gems within that made it worth wading through, they were often hidden amidst pages of muck. i still think the idea behind the book is strong and could work, however, and i admire yalom for trying, but at the same time i wonder if it's not somewhat unethical to reveal so much to a patient about the therapist's feelings, and also to give her free therapy in exchange for writing for him - like, is it a conflict of interest on his part, and therefore countertherapeutic? also, the book doesn't really say if she got better in the long-term. i'm not so sure... still glad i read the book, but didn't honestly feel i got too much out of it. many of his other books are head and shoulders above this one..."
2,Not quite as interesting as I expected,"As I am not a student of psychology and not a therapist I read Yalom's books from a layman's point of view, as I find stories of personal development and change very interesting. However, I found this particular book to be somewhat tiresome and I must admit I got a bit bored as I longed for Ginny's process to move on. I guess that reading such detailed descriptions of each session was finally not as exciting as expected. I personally prefer to read the general story of a patient in Yalom's other books with tales of psychotherapy."
5,totally delightful. Did not want it to end!,"Very enjoyable book. Well written. Found it fun to follow Woodrow Lowe throughout his life. Great summer time reading. Dry wit, lots of chuckles!"
3,"A good, but not great, read.","Thayer's novel lacks the charm and literary prowess of Thomas Berger's ""Little Big Man"" while following in the same tradition. Although the book is humorous, the resolution is weak, and some of the historical personalities are used as deus ex machinas, solving Woodrow Lowe's dilemmas. This novel nevertheless has its amusing points and most readers will enjoy this trip through history. If ""Man of the Century"" strikes your fancy, I recommend George MacDonald Fraser's ""Flashman"" series."
5,Makes you want to go on the same adventure!,"This book is so much more than just a boring book about the Sahara. It is an adventure that gives kids (and adults) a feel for what it would really be like to be there. The sights, smells, sounds, and excitement are described. There are so many interesting facts added, hand drawn maps, and beautiful photography. Both my daughter (10) and I enjoyed it. This is a great book for those studying Africa."
3,it's ok,"a pretty good knife...it is extremely sharp straight out of the box. it's also the longest of the SOG folders, and at 3.75"", is a force to be reckoned with. some have commented that the blade has a play or movement, but this doesn't seem to affect performance. in terms of looks and feel i love the tiger stripe and it feels great in my hand.it is hard to sharpen however, because the blade is not symmetrical on both sides. often times i end up just scratching the upper part of the blade on one side because it flares out more than on the other side."
5,Good stuff,You can not get a better every day carry knife. I have carried this for 3 years and its taken a beating but keeps on ticking like a glock.
4,Nice knife for the price,"Sog builds some descent stuff. There are certainly better knives out there, but probably not at this price. Sog did a good job with design, construction, and materials on this. You'll be happy with this for an everyday carry knife."
2,"High Quality knife, Tiger stripe not as shown","This is a very high quality knife, and i give it 5 stars for quality and construction. The tiger striping, however, does not match the picture shown. instead of cool looking foggy gray stripes, it has crappy looking tan painted on stripes. This is a purely cosmetic flaw, but product is not as advertised so only 2 stars."
4,Concerned about blade durability,"Great knife, but the blade thickness makes me wonder (and worry) if the blade would snap off under normal use ( I also worry about this snapping off and causing serious injury). Not that I planned on using this as a crowbar or hatchet, But I typically like to buy knives that are much sturdier (knives that won't give up when I need them to work most). So if you don't mind carrying a folding surgical scalpel (It's sure as hell as sharp as a scalpel!!) then buy this knife otherwise pick something sturdier."
4,TF-3,this knife is amazing. love the finish on the blade. handle is comfortable and gives excellent grip. for me the rope cutter isnt all that useful but for others it might be. clip is a little tight but that should fix itself over time. opens quickly and is very crisp. blade comes shaving sharp. my only complaint is that its blade has a fair amount of play which i fixed by tightening the pivot this causes it to be hard to open but it u put some marvels mystery oil on the pivot and work it a little it gets silky smooth
1,Not very interesting,"Purchased for my 1 year old at 6.99 in Target, thought it would be a good deal, but it is putting us all to sleep. Wish I would have read the reviews first. This is not going to be something we play for the holiday."
2,Baby Einstein disappointment,"We are Really big fans of the Baby Einstein Collection, and have all the CD's, which are wonderful. So, happily when I bought this one for my 15 month old, I was looking forward to the same quality of songs, but this one is redundant (3 versions of Jingle Bells), and boring. There is so much fantastic Christmas music, and the makers could've done sooo much better. Would return it if I could."
3,OKAY CD. SONGS JUST TO SHORT!,"HI ALL! I BOUGHT THIS CD AND THE DISNEY FAMILY CHRISTMAS ALBUM AND I RECOMMEND THAT ONE INSTEAD OF THIS ONE. THIS CD HAS A LOT OF VERY SHORT COMPLIATIONS FROM 20 SECONDS TO A LITTLE OVER MINUTE FOR LIKE EACH SONG. ACCEPT A FEW THAT ARE LITTLE LONGER. THE OTHER ALBUM HAS VERY BEAUTIFUL MUSIC SUNGS KIDS, ADULTS AND ARE THE FULL LENGTH SONGS. I RECOMMEND PEOPLE BUYING THE OTHER CD INSTEAD! YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!"
5,If you want an exhilarating ride---this song will MOVE you!,"Feel what you want is by an exceptional artist. To hear Krisitine's voice...well, you could definately say it is one that moves your inner soul. When she hits her high ranges to the bottom of her ranges, it keeps you breathless with chills! She has a mood that is 100% soul!!! Plus, with the seductive sounds of the keyboards wrapping around her vocals, well you can't even begin to describe the movement! Take the RIDE!"
4,The Alaska Pipeline,"I grew up in Alaska and left just before the Pipeline was built. Considering the Songs, Orion, North Sea Oil, Elegy. Then there's a picture of a polar bear on the album cover. I've always wondered if this were about the Alaska Pipeline. It would amaze me that Ian Anderson and Jethro Tull would even care about the environment of Alaska."
5,A Fine Album,"A bit of a dark horse in the Tull discography. It is also their darkest album.Many classic songs on this album. North Sea Oil to Dark Ages is all great. The rest actually is too. This album isn't one of the SMACK HIT YOU IN THE FACE WITH IT'S BRILLIANCE Tull albums, but the songs are great, and Ian is still at the top of his games. Plus, last time the classic people play on this album. After this, only Ian and Martin remain."
4,A Solid Tull Album,"Stormwatch seems to fly under the radar of most Tull fans. When I am in the mood for Tull, I often reach for other disks before I would grab Stormwatch. I am not sure why that is, Stormwatch is a very good album, the last of the 70's era Tull. The instrumentals on Stormwatch, Warm Sporran and Elegy, are fantastic! And the song Dark Ages is worth the price of the disk alone! I guess there just isn't anything that makes Stormwatch stand out like other Tull disks. If you are a Tull fan you have to own this one, if for nothing else that to hear John Glascock's last songs, and to hear Ian Anderson fill in on bass for most of the disk. Plus this is really the last Tull album that came out before plunging headfirst into the Keyboard and Synth heavy 80's. Stormwatch features some great songwriting by Ian Anderson and Ian's voice is very strong here. Jethro Tull is an amazing band, and almost every album is worth investing time in."
3,End of an era,"This was the final Tull album by the ""classic"" lineup and it is apparent from listening that they were suffering from a great deal of collective burnout. ""Dun Ringill"" continues to remain the highlight of the album, and two of the four bonus tracks, ""Kelpie"" and ""King Henry's Madrigal"" are exellent. It's too bad they couldn't have included live versions of ""Peggy's Pub"" or ""Jams O'Donnel's Jigs"" in this package. Overall not a bad Tull album, not a great one either."
1,"Jethro Dull, yes quite dull","With the exception of Dun Ringill, this is one boring album. I would categorize this album with the likes of Rock Island.And Ian sounds like an old man trying to sound peppy. Nothing against old men: I actually love Ian Anderson's solo works in ""Rupi Dance"" and ""Secret Language of Birds"" where his voice worked very well with the music."
4,Lost my cassette version...had to replace,"I remember I loved this tape when I had it back in the 70s. This is a tight musical statement by the Tull. Also, this one has bonus tracks that Peloser does not have. A good buy for solid musicianship. I have always respected this group although I'm not a big folk lover. This one stays away from a lot of the folk and rocks nicely in the progressive mode."
3,not their worst...includes a jem,"granted, this one is somewhat of a let down after ""Songs from the Wood"" and ""Heavy Horses"", but it has an original theme and there are some good songs on it, including one of my all time favorites: ""Dun Ringill"" (it's worth buying just for that...or get the boxed set). Over 20 years later, I also still find myself occasionally singing the chorus to ""Orion"".whether it's Tull's best album or not, the fact is, at the time of it's release, Tull had been worldwide touring professional musicians for over 10 years...incredibly talented ones, at that. The difference in the depth of this album (or any Tull album) compared to what is slopped out by most modern ""recording arstists"" is astronomical."
3,Good album and nothing more,"Not a great classic, but good from the start 'til the end. The best moments are Dark Ages and Flying Dutchman. Not much to say about this one."
1,"Non-original tracks, amateurish mastering and low quality manufacturing","This is as bad as it gets. Starting with the box itself - it's made of good quality material, but the cover you see in the pictures is actually a leaf of very thin paper which I guess was supposed to be glued to the box - but it isn't. Two of the CD cases inside the box were just shattered in such a way that I don't think can be blamed on postal transit. Then on to the tracks themselves. Most of them (like ""Su Di Noi"" and ""Una Lacrima Sul Viso"") are non-original versions of the songs (although recorded by the original artists), and the audio mastering is unbelievably bad. I couldn't help but stare in shock at the waveform of the ""Su Di Noi"" track. Shame on all involved in the production of this... thing."
5,Not a bad song on the entire CD,Low key jangly pop/rock with a few well placed upbeat sections. I read another reviewer say that this reminded him of what an early 80's R.E.M. / Violent Femmes fusion might have sounded like. Only better because this exists and that never did.
4,"Excellent Condition, Though Smaller Than Expected","The plant arrived earlier than expected which is usually nice. However, on this occasion we were out of town on the weekend and we received 8"" of snow. Luckily, the tree was packed very well and was still in great shape when I opened it.I repotted the tree and it seems to be adjusting well. It will be an indoor plant. I have another lemon tree in the dining room that is about 3 years old and produces about 4 lemons a year. They are the best lemons I have ever had and I am always torn what to use them for. The tree blooms in mid-winter and the smell of the flowers is such a treat. If you live in a dry environment, I recommend misting the tree as often as you remember.I only gave the tree 4 stars because it was smaller than I expected. For the price, I thought it would be larger. Otherwise, a great transaction."
2,Smaller then expected,"Tree came today. Item information states it will be shipped in 5 gallon container. This is not the case, the tree looks nice, but is smaller then I had thought and its in a 2.5 gallon container. The seller also doesn't have a direct way of contact. Not super happy at the moment."
3,I have had two lemon trees for four months now and only get what look like limes?? never change to yellow?? anyone else??,I bought two lemon trees that only produce green looking limes?? anyone else?? We are taking excellent care of them. HELP
1,Junk.,"My wife and I received this as a gift for our daughter. When trying to setup the synchronization with the cow, it took me about 20 minutes to realize that the only way this was going to occur was if my television was absolutely blasting AND the cow was two feet in front of it.We have a Bose Cinemate hooked up to our plasma. Do you have any idea how loud it is when cranked?! That's how high the volume needed to be to set this garbage up.Unfortunately, if you're not someone that enjoys sitting 30 inches away from a plasma television with the volume turned all the way up, this toy isn't for you. Once I WAS able to sync the device, as soon as I moved more than 4 feet away, the link was broken.Avoid this piece of (poop) at all costs."
2,the toy stopped working the next day,Supposed to be a great toy. Very interesting video. but the next day the toy stopped working:( my baby was really upset and disappointed.
1,Fairly useless Frank Peretti adaptation,"I've done a lot of looking into reputed near death experiences (NDEs) lately, and found that nearly all of them are free of verifiable content or useful information. Pittman's is no exception, as he admits his moral/spiritual ""message"" is nothing not already found in the New Testament. His grand tour of ""angels and demons"" doesn't offer a single verifiable detail either. Whatever happened to testing the prophets?If you needed this for a wake up call, then you weren't asleep, you were dead and buried under 30 feet of dirt."
5,If you haven't seriously considered the reality of the demonic world...,"I have read countless books, Christian and otherwise. This simple, short, downhome book is one at the top in my opinion. It tells the story of Howard Pittman's near death (actually he was legally declared dead, I believe) experience. He was taken on a little spirit realm tour and was shocked to see demons stalking and sometimes taking possession of people. One of the things that makes this book so credible, as well as fascinating, is the depiction of Pittman before the Throne of YHWH. Here he, who considered himself to be a pretty good Christian, is shown to be just the opposite and taken out by angels like a wet rag after a good verbal thrashing and some words of comfort. I don't think most people would even like to tell such a story on themselves. Actually, you can get this book, pretty much in its entirity, on Youtube. You may not see the world, or yourself, the same ways afterwards."
5,not a avril clone but than that,she writes her own songs not like hilary duff who has get people for that katy's album is one of the best album's of 2004 not like usher who thinks he can sings but uses a voices track in concert.if you see it buy it you won't be sorry
3,There's a lot of potential here.,"I enjoyed this album...it just feels pointless at times. The songs don't ever seem to go anywhere, & there's not really anything new or original here. Katy is a mediocre writer who just happens to have a great voice. People often compare her to Lavigne b/c of their similar style. I think Katy just needs to develop her writing skills, then she will blossom into an amazing artist. If you're an Avril fan, go for it, there a couple of really great songs on this thing. If you're trying to choose between the two, definitely go w/ Lavigne."
2,OK,"I was looking forward to Katy Rose's ""Because I Can."" However, it was sort of a dissapointment. The lyrics may be ""deep"" if your used to listening to Avril Lavigne, but most of the time, they seem so forced, and it doesn't flow. Many people have been saying Katy Rose is just like Avril, but there is definently much more substance in ""Because I Can,"" than the radio-friendly ""Let Go."" However, each song sounds the same. But, the title track, ""Because I Can,"" is almost worth buying the CD for. ""Because I Can"" is definenetly not a good CD, but not a horrible one either. It's okay."
3,Not A bad effort,"Her style is a bit more edgy than Hilary's, but I can see her singing some more attitude songs, without dressing punk or fake skating. A lot of epople are comparing her to liz phair which is odd, since I like liz phair a lot. Liz phair's older stuff was excellent, indie rock at its best, the new liz phiar is combining rock and pop with her latest album self titled ""liz phair"", I guess they share similar musical vibes, such as Katy toys with her lyrics saying she's a tease, candy and etc. She is only 14 and Liz is 36, as soon as Katy grows older around oh say 16 or 17 her sound will mature and hopefully her lyrics. The album is not bad... but needs some tuning. overall a slice of slighty rock popness"
5,Excellent Album,"I love the whole cd. It's absolutely fabulous. She's a 17 yr old who can sing absolutely amazingly. I'm not a stupid ""teeny bopper"" fan of every single pop crap music stuff out there. I'm a teenager still but over 16. In case u thought I was. SILLY YOU!Katy Rose's album is great. I love it and everyone should buy it. I'm very critical with the music I like. For one thing I HATE hilary duff! Ugh! Such a poor excuse for the music society. Every disney star thinks they should friggin sing, act, have a clothing line and all that crap jeez! Katy Rose is much BETTTER than them."
5,Finally Something Fresh,"I'm so glad that there is still fresh voices out there. Katy Rose is a raw, real voice for young woman. Her songs are so fulled with emotions and truth, laced with hope. I like the total feel of this album its blues, pop, jazz all in one. I can't wait to see more from her. You wouldn't be sorry if you give this album a listen!"
3,A great instrumental album,"Well if only this album was instrumental, because I got to tell you that the band is wicked and the sound is quite solid. As for Katy, well she's not great but not horrible but I sure wouldn't want to date a little agro chick like this. But back to the music, which is good only due to the bands ability to convey the feelings of ""whatever"". All in all if I could buy this album again I would solely based on the band."
1,oh boy,Katy Rose's music sucks. Does her band play the same thing in each song. She is boring and repeatative. She makes me want to listen to Yanni instead of her crap she calls music.
4,"This was an ""Enchanted"" CD!","I was looking for a new CD, and i was lucky to find Katy Rose's new CD, ""Because I can"". I like almost all of her songs, she has a great voice and awesome rhythms. Some of her songs, however, had swears in them that might require a parental advisery. In my opinion, bad language doesn't make the song any better. You don't need swears in a song to make it good. So, when I bought this CD, and I listened to ""Vacation"" for example, that has the F word in it, I was kinda confused why this CD didn't have a parental advisery. But aside from those things I think this CD was a good one to buy!"
1,Give me a break,"Ever suffer through a really horrible episode of Touched by an Angel? (Your first question should be: ""How can you tell the really horrible episodes from the mildly horrible ones?"") Imagine a TBAA episode written by a brain-damaged rhesus monkey who somehow gained access to a typewriter. The script is somehow doctored by the creative geniuses that bring us the 700 Club, then some publisher decides to turn it into a book and set it during the Civil War. The result: This painful work, Jacob's Blood. And exactly who is Brad Mangum to preach to anyone about how their families should get along? He can retire his Dr. Phil act and go back to his day job."
5,Great Moral Principles,"I loved this book! It was funny, scary, sad, and almost real. The characters are easy to love and understand, and some are easy to hate. But the moral values and principles that are approached in this book will make your heart swell and create in you a closeness and love for famly and God. How about a sequel, Brad Mangum?"
4,Surprisingly Interesting,"I was surprised by how this book captured my attention. Not usually a fan of historical novels, this book has an interesting element of suspense, that kept my attention. The characters are believable and involving. The author has woven into his plot a message of character, honor, honesty, and family unity. There is also an interesting religious twist. I recommend the book, it is a quick read and one which is quite enjoyable."
1,Don't bother,"If you're looking for a well-written, original story, keep looking. Jacob's Blood is a horribly amateurish novel, with a storyline that reads like a formulaic and heavy-handed attempt at recreating something from the Louis L'Amour library. It's weak in every aspect, and makes me wonder what kind of manuscript this publisher would NOT accept. As for the ""uplifting"" hokeyness, I find nothing uplifting about wasting a reader's time with a book produced by an author who was just going through the motions."
3,Add to history lessons,"When we learn about the Civil War in school, it's easy to think of it in abstract ways, neglecting to consider the true impact on individuals at the time. Jacob's Blood offers a look at what it must have been like to live through an awful episode in American history."
2,"Pleasant reading, but not more chatty than scientific","I have enjoyed all of David Crystal's books that I have read. He is an excellent linguist, whom I greatly admire for his ability to communicate effectively to a wide audience of varying linguistic experiences. However, this book is a simple narrative description of a project, not much more than a diary. The linguistic impact of this issue would accommodate one article in some journal, certainly not a whole book. If linguistics is your interest, choose another book."
3,"Historical, Icon","Besides Irvin Korr, beeing, Historical and a icon in history of Osteopathy, it's very scientific!Cesar Serpa From Brasil"
1,Not what I'd hoped for.,"I bought these to help me with the toe pain I get sometimes when I run. I put them on my orthodics and started out on my run. About two miles in my feet hurt so badly from the pads that I had to stop running and remove them. I was really hoping these would work for me as they had for some of the other reviewers. Unfortunately, they did not. $15 not well spent!"
1,Disappointed,I put these in a pair of Keen sandals....They kind of worked a couple of days...Then the pad started separating from the adhesive. The Pad is inching past the adhesive causing a two layer mess....Now I don't know how to get them out. REALLY wish I hadn't ruined my Keens...
1,Not durable!,I bought these for metatarsalitis. They lasted for two days before falling apart. The adhesive between the layers and on the bottom of the insole started slipping right away.
2,good but not enough instructions,This product is great if you already have an insole with metatarsal suupport. Otherwise it is impossible to know where to place it on the insole.
1,Crap,"Are you kidding? These were a total waste of time and money. Awkward to place in shoe, awkward to wear. Sent back."
1,Product adhesive let go the first day,Bad adhesive holding layers together. Poor quality. Product came apart. Needs a recall from market. Top layer migrated quickly from bottom layer.
2,Not portable,Once you put this item in its not removable and it does not allow any felixibilty if you install in the wrong place.
3,lifts for Morton's Neuroma,"I found these pads to be too high for my neuroma (to use in my running shoes). A handmade solution out of moleskin works better for me in those, and a wider pad for across the foot feels more natural in my shoes."
1,Disappointing,"I really wanted to like these, so much so that when the first pair arrived defective, I immediately reordered. The second pair seemed fine so I put them in my brand new sandals. The idea of the breathable cover is a great concept. Just not a great execution of that concept. Within two weeks of sporadic use, the neoprene cover has completely separated from the pad. To be fair, Amazon has refunded the full purchase price. But now I have to pull these out and figure out how to get the adhesive off. For $10 less than these, you can get met pads from Hapad. They aren't perfect either, but at 1/3 the price, it's a better bet."
1,Felt like I was standing on a rock.,"I bought this to pad the ball of my foot in a dance shoe (heels). I tried it in every position imaginable, but it was just too thick and hard for my purpose. Didn't bother to send it back because I'd already paid half the price on shipping. Guess i'll give it to someone or whom it might work..."
2,Very hard book!,"This book is very hard to understand. The author uses very complex mathematics, that most graduate and professors don't even understand. When coming up with the formula he skips steps that he assumes everyone knows how to do. This book would be ok for graduate students, but for an introduction to fluid dynamics it is a very difficult book. The book does have a lot of examples on different types of systems that will be useful if you ever use that kind of system. The book does have examples for a wide variety of engineers (ie bioengineers, mechanical, civil...). But overall this book was very difficult!!!"
1,Crazy,"I am a junior chemical engineer taking a class that is using this book. This book is awful. The examples are made to be over complicated, and the problems at the end of each chapter are vague, and full with clarity issues. I would not suggest this book to anyone, and i pity those who are subject to its fury."
4,Napoléon et l'imagerie d'Epinal,"A travers un texte dense et clair et de superbes illustration, Barbara Day-Hickman nous offre un tour d'horizon complet des débuts de l'imagerie d'Epinal et de son rle dans la diffusion du mythe napoléonien par l'image. Le point fort de cet ouvrage réside incontestablement dans l'énorme travail de recherche effectué par l'auteur, qui permet de mettre en lumière les rapports entre l'imagerie et le politique.A must for those who are interested in popular art. Anyone who works on the napoleonian myth should read this book."
3,Wanted to like it but found it tough going.,"To my knowledge this is only the third Shawnee that anyone has written a book about, Tecumseh and the Prophet being the other two. An interesting time period, but I found myself yawning thru this rendition of it. Perhaps there was just too little data for the author to work with. After reading the book, Blue Jacket still seems a shadowy figure, a block of wood, a carved face on a totem pole. The author gets an A+ for research for all I know, but I wish he had found something in this story that had some charm, some mystery, or some semblence of personality."
2,This guy just isn't a very good writer,"It tried to like this book, but I couldn't. This guy is just not a very good writer. He takes a very exciting period of history and makes it not so exciting. He is good at presenting facts (though some are a little shaky), but not so good at writing a story based on the facts. There are better writers dealing with this time period."
2,Eh.,"Eh. Thats basically my response to this work by Roach. It just didn't do anything for me. Some people really liked this one, but I just found it uninspiring---it just didn't grab me like some of his other albums. The treated guitar sounds were a bit annoying at times. Still you may think it worth having if you're a Roach fan."
1,Couldn't Get Past The 1st 20 minutes...,"... and I love the people involved and was ""in the mood"" to laugh. But it was horrible. Stay away."
4,It's a Mockumentary,This is a great movie for those who get it. Go into it knowing that you're going to be watching a Mockumentary and you won't be disappointed.
3,Not a total chopped ball,The budget for this movie wasn't high at all. Keeping that in mind it wasn't bad but some of the acting had room for improvement. There are a couple funny parts in the movie that a few friends and I bring up now and then. I am a paintball player.
2,Some funny parts but very crude,"Saw this movie in the theater.It's the kind of awkward, stupid but funny, humor that you need to be around with a bunch of friends to laugh at. But unfortunatley for the most part the humor quickly becomes very crude, which in 99% of the cases doesn't even add any humor to the movie.Some funny scenes here and there that are good to quote with your buddies, but overall it's a missed opportunity because you feel like this movie could have been a cult classic.I would not reccommend this movie to anyone, except perhaps to a group of paintball players on a road trip or a bachelor party. It's worthless otherwise."
1,"Bad, Just Bad","This was really disappointed. I have been playing paintball for the past four years and have played for over 600 hours. As for paintball movies, I have seen a LOT of them (more than anyone that I know, and I know a lot of ballers). This might be the worst ""paintball"" video that I have seen. Even if it wants to be called a ""movie"", it is really bad in comparison to what is out there (seen thousands of those, most much better than this). Sure, the filming is technically pretty good, but that's about it. If you love paintball, don't waste your time. If you're thinking about playing paintball, don't waste your time. Try something like ""Cereal Killerz"", ""Road to World Cup"", or ""Heroes for a Day"". Or just scan TV listings for ""paintball"" -- some of them are NOT what you should do for safety reasons, but at least they will be more entertaining."
2,Bits are Bent right out of the Box,"Several of the bits in the set I received are warped or bent, such that the point oscillates visibly as the bit rotates in a stable chuck. They do make holes, but are useless for precise work because they tend to drill oversize and it's difficult to control the exact location of the hole."
5,Intelligent rock at its finest,"I must admit, I had never heard of this band until a good friend of mine sent me a song of theirs. The moment I heard it, I was hooked. The lyrics are intelligent and tap into real emotion. A must have for anyone who likes to have some substance with their strumming."
5,Holy Fruit Salad!!,"When i saw these guys live a few months ago, i instantly fell in love with their music. They write songs about things that you and i got through day in and day out and stay completely honest throughout. PENNY is definitely my favorite song off of the album."
4,Great movie which should be on DVD.,"Sister Kenny was an amazing, interesting woman. I would have loved to have met her. The movie is just a taste of her amazing full life; well worth watching. Such a pity it is not on DVD yet."
4,A Fine Performance by Russell,"Rosalind Russell has done it again. She is just as convincing in this role (of a dedicated woman trying to save kids from the crippling affects of polio), as she was in ""Auntie Mame"" (guiding young Patrick through life's pitfalls). She does her best work with kids; such as in ""Gypsy"", and ""The Trouble With Angles"" (where she plays Mother Superior to two mischievous students in a convent school). If you feel the need to be inspired by a truly dedicated and forthright person within a world of adversity; then this film is for you. Also; if you are a Russell fan (and haven't yet seen this one), you are in for a treat. If only more dedicated people out there (and there are many) could have their work recognize (within various fields); this would be a most fortunate world indeed. I am a Philosopher and writer of aphorisms (thematic verse); my work is found at Lulu,com/RachelPugh."
4,The remarkable life of a true hero,"At first I felt this film was pretty slow. I had difficulty liking sister Kenny since I felt it was foolish of her to want to marry when she was so needed by all those sick kids. But the film grew on me, and the enormity of her sacrifice and the hardship she endures to try to persuade the stubborn doctors to change their treatment of polio was quite moving.By the end of this film, I felt quite impressed. Kenny was a courageous woman who did what she thought was right.. No matter the cost to her own happiness.This was well worth the watch. I only wish Kenny had found a boyfriend who could've supported her and her cause, or a doctor who could've sponsored her research... Things might've been easier."
2,Soporific hagiography ;torpour inducing,"Sister Elizabeth Kenny was ,beyond question,a remarkable woman.Her pioneering treatments for polio victims were eventually hailed all over the world and her triumph was achieved in the face of often implacable resistance from the medical establishment in her native Australia and elsewhere.It is an inspiring story about a redoubtable womanThis is not alas a movie that does either her or her achievements justice.It is too slow,the tone is over reverential and the acting is just plain bad.Lighting is dull and unimaginative and pacing funerealThe story is there on screen but presented in so flat and unimaginative a way that audiences will most probably cease to care long before it crawls its way to a climax that is leaden rather than inspirationalMisfiring tribute to an exceptional person but hopefully the movie will inspire some to read about the woman and if so it will have served a useful purpose"
5,Great arrangements!,"I bought this for son's bedtime 4 years ago and had no idea how much I would enjoy it! I am a musician and generally just tolerate most music marketed for kids. These Fred Molin CDs were quite the pleasant surprise. The arrangements are relaxing and very high quality. Not cheesy or too new-agey. Many real acoustic instrument performances, not all synthesized BS.I look forward to getting this out around Thanksgiving as a break from the Disney Lullaby I and II CDs we put in year-round (these are also great). For what it's worth, there's nothing really ""Disney"" about the CD, must just be the label or producer."
5,Best christmas lullaby cd,This cd is one of my favorites. The songs are so peaceful and will lull any child to sleep. It is a must have for any holiday collection.
2,The Hero is a Jerk!,"This is probably the worst book in the series, and I barely managed to finish it. I found the main characters (Winston & Deliah) incompatible, and the love story unbelievable (and I'm not referring to the magic, but the relationship itself). The only reason I did finish this book is because I liked the previous ones, and I hate to not finish a book once I start. The good news is that the next one in the series is a vast improvement, and Winston becomes much more likable in the next sequel! Don't stop yourself from reading the series because of this one, I promise it gets better!"
3,"Beware, this book has no end!!","It was a good book, strong characters. It's the third in a series, with the main characters from the preceeding books, but I suggest you reread them to figure out where the new hero fits in. The only problem was all of the loose ends at the end, the author is going to write another book and tie them up then, but that'll be in another year. If you liked the first two books you should enjoy this one, just remeber there isn't an ending!"
1,Couldn't even finish it...,"I loved Everlastin' when i read it, and still find myself dreaming about memorable scenes, so i logically assumed i'd enjoy this book. well, i tried to read it, and found it so boring that i couldn't even finish it...this from me, an aspiring writer."
5,Nice Sneaker for the money!!,"This is my 2nd time owning this style of Reebok sneaker. They look good, feel good on my feet--comfortable, and cost a whole lot less than comparable Nikes.Once these wear out, I will buy a 3rd pair...I hope that Reebok continues to make them."
5,Burnside had the guts to shake up the blues: awesome.,"Mr. Burnside decided to shake some of the cobwebs out of the blues genre, and probably p.o.'ed some purists in the process. If you can get through the loss of some of the purity of blues, this is one tremendous disc.There are a few non-altered pieces on the disc, and the live version of the title song will stick in your head like flypaper, as will the next track, ``Let My Baby Ride'' with the man himself sampling his last name. The other outstanding track is the remixed version of ``Rollin' Tumblin' ''.What confuses most people who like the blues is that the music isn't supposed to be so upbeat. But that's what makes this disc breathe - the fact that it goes against the grain. Burnside had the guts to take on not only his music, but an entire genre and twist and shape it into something foreign - and the results are wonderful."
4,"An acquired taste, but try it","This album is kind of like wasabi: it takes some getting used to but if you do, you have a friend for life. You're in for a big surprise if you're expecting traditional blues from this old bluesman. This is techno remix blues, which obviously won't please some, but he pulls it off. Best-known and probably the best tune is ""It's Bad You Know"", played on WXRT in Chicago, who turned me on to the album. Most of the cuts are musical loops, not all of which work, but overall pretty solid and recommended for anyone wanting something different. Die-hard blues purists need not apply."
1,I prefer to stay outside,This is bad bad bad. I am certainly a purist and hate to see cultural icons and forms such as this melded so poorly. It doesn't work. I love R.L.'s pure blues. They are top notch and tough to find better but electronica and blues doesn't cut it. I am a Depeche Mode fan as well but some things are best left alone. I will be selling this back to a CD store.
1,"File next to ""Electric Mud"" and ""Howlin'Wolf's New Album""",History can be an important teacher. We've seen this happen before with the great bluesmen back in the late 60's and early 70's. Why do these folks think they can take something that is pure and downright perfect and improve on it is just a comment on how big egos can grow. It's one thing to appreciate something great for what it is but it's another to try and manipulate it and turn it into something completely opposite of it's intention. Am I the only RL fan who thinks this stuff is crap?
5,Magical mix!!!!,"What R.L. Burnside and Rothrock done in this cd, is a fantastic evolution of the modern music,like no other have tried until now!The genial idea to put together electronic musicians with the strong of the news,and this experienced old bluesman from the Delta,is a magical thing that only visionary people could try,and the result is really a new kind of music that will put together dancing and dancing,both the bluesfans and all of the youngs influenced by electronic music!!This is a rare opportunity of this sinergy between the old and new works to create a new kind of music destinated to satisfy all!!! We must give congratulations to Fat Possum Records and the iniciative.I really recomend this cd to those people that are in tune with the modern,conceptual,intense,...music created by musicians full of good intentions!!! Great work!I'm a bluesfan and want to thanks this opportunity to know something about new tunes and experiences!! Come on in,and enjoy this fantastic trip!!!!!"
5,true alchemy,"To appreciate this incredible album one must understand that Mr. Burnside was raised in the country and matured in the city; which rationalizes the true alchemy of this electrifying rural/uban mix. The amazing power and energy of this album will stand as R.L.'s burning memorial. So-called blues purists may take issue, but blues music is not ""pure"" - it is the soul expression of the performer's life experiences... good, bad, pleasurable or painful and everything in between - like this album."
4,truly an addicting series that has me counting down to it's conclusion,"The Children of the Red King series was delightful surprise, being a dead fast Harry Potter fan and fanatic I expected to really dislike this series that many have dubbed as copycat but this is truly an addicting series that has me counting down to it's conclusion. The world Nimmo creates is original but does relay on common genre devices that some seem like Harry Potter details but are really common in the world of fantasy and science fiction. For children or anyone bored between Harry Potter books these are really excellent books with great story lines and good characterization. I highly recommend this series."
2,Twisting book that can probbably hurt the mind,"This book was very interesting, however it had too many things going on at once. It was hard for me to follow. It had a lot of action, but it was confusing and hard to follow. I like the red king series, but this was the worst of the five. Plus, it was a total Harry Potter wannabe. If you liked this book, the GREAT! Go pick up a harry potter book instead. You'll like it 10x as much. Trust me."
4,this book was,"these books were really really good. the first one was awesome i couldn't stop reading even though it was a lil young for me. the characters are very well writen and i think that the author is very creative with their endowments, like the bird(tollroc) i thought that was wicked and i really liked how they introduced some new characters and dropped a few hints on things yet to come. i think that although this book may be in many ways similar to harry potter it has it's own uniqueness. like the maze (different becuase well i think it is), Mr. Pilgirm, Mrs. Bloor, their endowments, the Red king, and theres not really a hermonie character. i think that this book is a new classic and the evil characters really i evil and unforunatly there seems to be no turning back for Billy. i also the the veiw point which is used it definatly helps you understand the book. I can't wait for what is yet to come"
2,yawn,yet again another book about kids with odd powers.harry potter is way better.this book was weird.what good is it if you can hear pictures talking.oh wow.
3,A little confusing...,"Unlike in most sequels to books, Charlie Bone and the Time Twister did not give an update on what happened in the first book. I only read the first book in the series by Nimmo, Midnight for Charlie Bone, last year. Yet, I had a hard time remembering the complex characters. (So I'm wondering how a child would.) It seemed that in the plot structure there are so many complications that do not get resolved before a new one arises that I get confused. I'm hoping that all of these complications come together and resolve themselves at the end. I am not finished, but I do plan on continuing until the end. After the first half, it began to pick up pace enough for me to not abandon it."
4,SPECTRUM Children's Book Club Recommendation,"Reading Level: Ages 9-12In this second Charlie Bone story, Jenny Nimmo seems to be hitting her stride. With the character introductions out of the way, and the major underlying plot line established, She is free to hurtle us into the past in order to come to the present, when a relative, who could be Charlie's doppelganger, is whisked by a glowing marble from Bloor's academy to the Bloor's Charlie now attends.Amidst the underlying struggle of good and evil that permeates both the academy and Charlie's Yewbeam family history, Charlie must discover the truth about the boy from the past to secure the boy's future. This book was more enjoyable than the first.- KB Shaw, PublisherSPECTRUM Children's Book Clubwww.incwell.com"
3,Comments,"I liked the book, but there were too many things going on at once. First there's the time twister, then tere's Ezekiel, and Billy Raven, then there's the evil man from the picture, and the there's the Yewbeam family along with Yolanda trying to find the time twister while manipulatingsome kids into thinking that she's a sweetheart. It's just too much unless you really follow the different parts of the story and are an intense reader."
3,Three and A Half Stars,"Sort of a younger, poor mans Harry Potter, the second Charlie Bone book seemed a bit steadier on it's legs despite some character development that defies sense. Charlie's Grandma and Aunts seem so terribly mean, without any real explanation except to create a bit of conflict, and perhaps later books will reveal why this is.But for example, when one of the characters is almost killed by them in the book, the others brush it off as if it was a minor inconvenience!?! Still there's plenty to like about this series, especially in the young hero Charlie, and for young people interested in fantasy, but still too young for Harry, this might just be the ticket."
4,Cool.,This is quite cool but it's kinda short. I watched it and enjoyed it very much. Britney is my idol and she rocks. She is pretty and has a nice figure. I will support all her products too. She has done well in her career and should work on her love life. Hope everyone who watched this enjoyed it!
5,I'd give it 11!,"This book was awesome! I can't remember the last time I read such a thrilling book. The characters kept you captivated and the plot twists were both unpredictable and exciting. Fans of reality shows may not like this book, since it downplays them...but i would give it 11 stars. I've suggested this book to many family members who, after reading it, ahve told me how much they liked it."
5,Loved it!,"If you find it hard to flip the channel when a reality show is on, you will find it just as hard to put this book down. Sure, the premise is ""out there"", but that is what makes the book fun.Definitely a page turner."
2,Two Good Things,"I'm sorry to say I was duped into reading this boook by all the good reviews on this page - but after struggling through the last 200 pages I can only think of a few good things: a terrific plot idea and a clever way to keep most of the characters straight by matching the first initial of their name with the first initial of their occupation (e.g., Nora - nun, Charles - CPA, Renee - realtor, etc.). But too many things fell apart in the middle of what started out to be fun. When Foster the fisherman just left the island and nobody ever noticed or wondered where he went - and when even the ""Control"" lost count of how many people were left alive, the book simply lost what little credibility it had. Like Reilly's Temple and Deitrich's Getting Back, the book had potential but didn't deliver."
1,"It's time to leave, the tribe has spoken......","If I could give this book 0 Stars, I would. I'm a HUGE fan of the show Survivor. When I heard about this book, I went to many book stores and libraries to find it. I finally did and was very excited to read it. I was very disappointed in t his books. This is nothing like Survivor or ""reality shows"". It alomst seems like the ""reality"" aspect was just an afterthought. What this is really about bioterrorism.The characters are so weak, and flat, its' not funny. They act in away that makes the characters unreal. The dialouge is flat people just dont' talk that way.I suggest that if you like shows like Survivor then stay away from this 24/7.*hold paper with 24/7 on it. It's time to leave, the tribe has spoken."
3,Too much sexual connotation,Ok I admit I am only half way through this book. I couldn't wait to get it and read it because the premise is such a great idea. I did happen to get a Bound Galley edition so maybe the final was editted better. I think Jim Brown could have had a strong story without all the sexual innuendos and situations. His writing is a little weak as well and he uses too many similes. I'd love to see this story reworked by someone else.
5,Great!,Very interesting and suspenseful. Brings a whole new twist to reality TV. Very fast-paced and keeps you wanting more. Surprising ending. Really good book.
2,Sincere but nothing unique,"This was a very short book. It took me less than half an hour to read it. My favorite thing about this book is the title. I agree with the message of this book but it isn't anything I haven't heard before. I've read a number of books related to women and spirituality, and Lynne Hybels' story is pretty typical. She seemed to convey a sincere awakening but it wasn't anything unusual. If you've never read anything related to women's spirituality and you don't like reading long books, this might be for you. But otherwise, I wouldn't recommend it."
3,A worthwhile story but way too short,"This has got to be one of the shortest books I have read in ages - and at 8.99 in the UK ($14.99 in the US) I can hardly consider it good value.Lynne Hybels, wife of Bill Hybels of Willow Creek, tells us about her life as a pastor's wife and how she conformed to all the expectations of her role as mother, woman, pastor's wife, Christian - but missed out on the joy and true power that God can provide. An experience of depression and counselling helped her to understand her true role - not just as a support to those around her, but as someone God can use directly.The book is hardback with arty photos to illustrate some of her points; the lines are widely spaced and it's a slim volume anyway, but I was astounded to discover I had read the whole book in just sixteen minutes. It was a good read, well-written, but I can't consider it value for money."
4,Get moving!,"What I liked most about this book is that it motivated me to get moving. Over the past year, I've been on a journey of self-discovery and this book helped me verify a lot of important issues, the main one being that my voice does matter! It's short and so simple to read, yet filled with life long lessons. Who wants to watch life pass them by? Not me and obviously not Lynne Hybels either. I'd strongly suggest this book to read alone or in a book club. It's not set up for discussion, but there's no doubt that you'll have plenty to talk about. So, get moving!"
3,"A little short, but so true",This book arrived in excellent condition. I read the entire book in about an hour. I found myself looking for more! Although I was thankful to know others believe a woman can be tough and full of love at the same time.
5,Love the book,I am happy with this transactin. Shipping was fast. The book is in very good condition. I love the book.
1,Very Disappointing,I read this book in about twenty minutes and learned nothing from it. It reads more like a little devotional with very little substance. I expected more from the author and was very disappointed. I definitely do not recommend this book.
5,"By far, the best boot I've ever worn","I've been in the military for 8 years, and have gone through probably a dozen different types of boots. These are the best combination of price, comfort, and durability. The pair I'm about to retire have been going strong for almost 4 years, and in those 4 years the only issue is one of the boot laces frayed. I wouldn't recommend these as extreme cold weather boots because they lack the insulation to keep your feet warm in a Korean/Alaskan/Upstate NY winter. But for weather that's warmer then freezing, these are extremely durable. They've done dozens of 3-6 mile ruck marches, and a couple of 12 milers without any issues with my feet. They've also held up well through two deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan, so if you require a durable boot that breathes well, and is comfortable to move in all day, this is a great boot."
1,disappointed,"i was really hoping that this would work because Tom's of Maine gives me a rash and regular deodorant with aluminum gives me bumps underneath my armpits :(it smells awesome out of the stick but when you put it on, it's really sticky and makes me smell worse than not wearing any deodorant at all!!!unfortunately, i wasted 7.50 on this and i wish i could get my money back... i guess now it's time to choose between a rash and bumps.. i can't win!"
2,Red Rash Under Arm,I purchased the Jason line of deodorants because I am looking for more natural products ! I looked on the stick and it said PURE/NATURAL/&ORGANIC why did I develop a rash under my arm..Aloe Vera is one of the most gentle products and I have used it in a gel and applied it on my skin with great results .What is hidden in this product that cause this rash ???? PARABENS?
2,It smells like sweat to me,"This deordorant smells like sweat. When I put it on I just fell sweatier. Others may find the scent pleasant and the deodorant effective... me and my nose had the opposite reaction.The first day I tried it, I spent the day thinking I needed a shower. Instead of my usual moisturizing bar, for 3-4 days I used antibacterial soap. Didn't help. I was still ""ripe.""I let it rest for a few weeks. Maybe it was reacting with some food.... Nope! Phew! Couldn't stand it!I tossed it."
2,"nice smell, not strong enough","I love the Jason brand products in general - especially the hair products. But this deordorant just isn't strong enough to handle my underarm odor - w/n one or two hours, I start to smell."
2,It does not last,I tried using this and at first the scent was ok and kept you dry. It wears off after a few hours. I am really disappointed with this product.
1,not for me,This deodorant does not last long enough and it completely discolored my skin. My underarms are way darker than the rest of my skin now and it started peeling so I stopped using it. It might work for some people but it didn't for me.
2,Not worth purchasing,"This deodorant smells really awesome on it's own, but when you put it on it doesn't block the smell of sweat at all, the smell of apricot and sweat just sort of mix together (as someone else mentioned) and you're left with this other strange smell that isn't really an improvement from not wearing anything at all. It also feels a bit greasy for a while after you put it on. I don't sweat much either because I'm almost always cold. Definitely won't be purchasing this again."
5,great joystick,this joystick is very good because you can play with the wheel and with the pad is for car games and normal games and it works with windows 98
2,V3 Racing wheel,I bought the wheel about 2 years ago on my old computer and worked for a couple months untel the new direct x came out and it was conflicting with it so i went to there website and downloaded the driver. I now have it on windows 98 and on my new computer which is windows 2000 with 1.4 gigahertz
1,V3RACINGWHEEL,"I WISH YOU ALL WOULD MAKE A DISK FOR WINDOWS 98. AS FAR AS RATING I WOUL NOT RECOMEND THIS PRODUCTAT ALL IF YOU CAN NOT USE IT IN WIN 98. ALSO, THERE IS NO TECSUPPORT WITH A TOLL FREE TELEPHONE NUMBER 5THAT WORKS."
2,You can do better,I purchased a V3 Racing Wheel and experienced a lot of difficulting getting it's drivers to work on both Win98 and Win2000. I would recommend ThrustMaster's Nascar Racing Wheel. I much better purchase for me.
3,Not a great album...,"I bought the album mainly because it's got Encore Un Fois & Ecuador, I couldn't care less about the rest of the songs because they are weak!"
5,Best Euro-style dance mix that i know of,"Sash! A relatively New band in the United states is slowly starting to gain recognition in the dance and trance circuit with the release of their album ""It's my Life."" This album combines aspects of different Dj's: Dj shadow, Dj icey, etc. and mixes them all up with a heavily European club influenced sound to make a great cd for dances, or just some enjoyable music to listen to at home. Truly one of the greatest cd's I have ever listened to. Also, if you are into this stuff, I believe that, though a little different in style, Dj shadow would be another good listen. Particularly, his debut cd, endtroducing, with my favorite track, organ donor (extended overhaul version.)"
4,Stir the imagination!,"I purchased this for my 5-year-old son as a Christmas present and it was one of the best choices I made. Not only does he love drawing pictures and recording stories (and songs), but its lightweight profile has made it a must have for travel. We took it on the plane, into restaurants (with the rule that no playing with the recorder at the table), etc."
3,Make sure you get a new one!,The item I received had obviously been used and returned. The edges of the toy were a little scratched and worn and all of the pieces had been put in the box without any kind of packaging. Still waiting on the replacement.
2,"hard to press buttons, poor reception","I wanted to like this watch, but couldn't. If you want a decent atomic watch, get one of the timex ones, such as ""Timex 1440 Sports Radio Control 50041"" or ""Timex 1440 Sports Radio Control 50031"". I have the 50041 and it has no trouble receiving the time in Washington State.This casio was the smallest and lightest of the casio waveceptors but is still way too big."
2,Not all that impressed...,"Had it for a year and a half.Loved the accuracy. Lots of features and bells and whistles. Neat when you first get it, but you don't really use them much.I'll echo the comment that the buttons are too hard to activate.Watertight seal failed at the year and a half point.Will buy another Waveceptor type watch, but not this one."
3,Nice watch but...,"the band broke in less than a year. Actually it was not the band but the side of the plastic case. It's a nice watch but if you want durability, choose one of the metal banded waveceptors."
5,A Really Good Buy!,"There's nothing dumber than an expensive watch that doesn't keep accurate time. Conversely, nothing smarter than a cheap watch that is always accurate? Well, not quite - the plastic crystal scratches, and the appearance is definitely not up to Tiffany standards. But I've had the watch at least two years, no problems (except for minor crystal scratching), and am very satisfied!"
3,Leaked!!! and scratches easily,"Ok, I've had my watch for a while now, the face slightly bulges out so it scratches really easily. Battery life has been good, no problems there. and some reviewers had trouble with the buttons but they worked perfectly on mine. the one major problem I've had is, it leaks! I've never opened it so its still factory sealed. However I can't get it a least bit wet. It's supposed to go down 150 feet (5 bar). So if you are the least bit rough to your watches, you might want to consider a different one."
5,Never be late.,No need to set your watch. It sets itself. Very accurate and good-looking on the writst.
3,love the crash but very disappointed in Amazon.,"The crash has a great dark sound and came very promptly. The thing I was disappointed in is that the description says ""new"" but it is clearly a used crash. There are the marks from it being on a crash stand and also scratches on the crash and some discoloring on the back. I felt like I had been a little deceived and am disappointed in Amazon. I know these crashes usually go for a long time but I would still like to have the comfort to know it is a new crash. I need it for a performance I am playing in 2 weeks, so I don't have time to return it but I hope that this is an exception and unintentional."
1,NEVER RECEIVED POSTER,"I have yet to receive this poster that I purchased at least a month ago, I would not recommend ordering through this dealer!!!"
5,Son of Man,"Andrew Harveys new book Son of Man is a masterpiece, for years I have been reading books on Christ, but this book tells us all how we can live as Christ did. Written so all can understand, Harvery doesnt waste our time with words and ideas that are to far off to understand. His thoughts and ideas are very close to the Unity Church. A must read for all who know that Christ lives within all of us."
1,When porn stars try to go mainstream,"Have you ever been out for a drive and seen an awful car accident and could not help watch? That is a good way to describe this movie, torturously engaging.The main character plays a striking resemblence to a really buff Ben Stiller, please take a look and email me if I'm wrong.The plot, well, I watched the whole thing, and I don't think I noticed a plot, basically scenes were intertwined randomly to connect breasts to swordplay, swordplay to breasts, and sometimes both at the same time, so, why didn't I like this movie?"
2,Deathstalker has a turn on part,In Deathstalker a guard of the sorceror transforms into a hot woman in an attempt to kill stalker.Great transformation scene but besides that the movie is not so great
1,The Worst Sword and Sorcery Film,"Ever wonder what really makes a film bad? Look no further as you will find every element of bad film in this atrocious production. This film has absolutely no comprehensible plot. At the same time, Richard Hill and pretty much every other actor who participated in this film is a prime example of bad acting. A bad Kung-Fu film from China would be Oscar material compared to this worthless crap: it would even have a better script and dialogues. I could go on and on but let me just say that I recall seeing this film 22 years ago when I was 12 and I found it comically repugnant even then. One star is too kind of a rating for this piece of junk."
3,I've seen worse,"Those of you slamming this one haven't seen enough bad movies. Take my word for it I have seen an abundence of bad movies. This one doesn't stink. ""Red Sonja"" stinks. I guess partly because with Arnold Schwarzenegger in it I thought it might have a decent story, acting, and music like ""Conan the Barbarian"". Was I ever wrong. This one doesn't take itself so serious I don't think. That or it was campy enough it seemed to catch my interest. Fans of silly sword and sandal movies probably won't hate it."
3,Deathstalker....,The first deathstalker has got to be the best in the series. It's not much on acting but the swordplay and nudity make up for that so if you looking for a movie you can enjoy then you might want too try this if you want one with a good stroy line try 13th warrior
2,Watch This For A Laugh,"I bought this a little while back along with Beastmaster, Conan Complete Quest, and Red Sonja. After popping Deathstalkers in(Ive never seen it before, but it was only $5.00), I wasn't sure if I was watching a softcore porn or a sword and sorcery flick. The movie is basically made up of really ugly troll creatures, sex and nudity, cheesy sword fights, and the most awful lines I've ever heard in a movie. Also, the plot is basically nonsensical, which makes this even more of a gem. I love this movie because of its bad acting, bad script, and low budget, its hilariously funny. Im not a fan of senseless nudity though, which this movie has a ton of, but other than that, this movie is hilarious(even though I'm pretty sure it wasn't intended to be).Only buy this if your expecting it to be really crappy, because its not an awesome Sword and Sorcery flick, more like a spoof."
3,stupidly good,"This is one of those films which was meant to be serious but comes off as so stupid that it becomes a good comedy. The effects, and especially the sword fighting is so silly it will have you on your knees laughing."
1,f_ck this book...joyce was a humanist,the theory of aesthetics laid forth in portrait of an artist remained foundational...joyce was an ARTIST. . .postmodernism is anti-art. this book should go to hell.
5,Better than Tupperware,"This is a great cake storage container. I have used the Tupperware ones before and I actually like this one better. It is far less expensive and the locks on the sides are really smooth and the top handle is short, but durable. Easy to clean and a great basic color (gray with opaque lid)."
4,sturdy,and made well. I really am impressed with the strong plastic material and the locking mechanism on the sides.It should last a long time.
5,A Great Book for Young People,"How sad that a wonderful book such as this one had to go out of print, when it would be such a wonderful exercise book for young people of any time, any age. I can't praise this book enough for the ideas presented and the art work that accompanies each exercise. It would be an invaluable aid for grade school children - to help them understand life's concepts and using them for their own benefit through life. I strongly recommend this book - if it can still be found.Shirley Lawrence, author:The Secret Science of Numerology,Numerology and the English CabalahExploring NumerologyHollywood Be Thy Name: An Inside Look at Hollywood Actors and Extras[...]"
1,Not as good as the other reviews state,"I just received this fireplace screen. It is of average quality at best (kind of like something you might find at Garden Ridge). The screen is made in China, the hinges don't open smoothly, and the welds are bumpy, unpainted, and often not even complete. Some of the other glowing reviews of this screen are suspect in my opinion. If you click on the 'see all my reviews' link, you will find that many of the reviewers have only reviewed this one item. It is possible that someone with a financial interest in these screens is posting bogus reviews. I regret this purchase and will return it once the seller, American Home Furnishing, replies to my e-mail (strangely, the seller didn't include a receipt or return instructions in the box)."
5,looks great!,I really like my fireplace screen- it's very nice looking. I've seen others in stores for less but they were shorter and narrower- this one is oversized and has alot of design to it.
5,We love it,"The screen is well made. We like it for it's intricacy and subtlety, meaning that the intricacy does not overpower a room, but is noticeable when looking at it.Would purchase this item again!"
5,Very beautiful tall fireplace screen,"I had some concerns after reading previous reviews, but decided to order it anyway. Nice quality, no issues so far, the mesh and the pattern are beautiful. My fireplace looks gorgeous now :)"
3,One Size Fits All Concept,"It's an excellent product except that for those with smaller feet, there is a lot of excess room inside and it's difficult to keep the warmth of the wax prolonged. The spa used a velour bootie that was sized just right for smaller feet and, of course, it felt more form-fitting and held in the warmth of the wax longer. Also, while it has velcro tabs inside at the top edge in order to tighten the top opening, it doesn't work very well. It would have been great to be able to choose a small, medium, or large velour bootie size, or to make this one more adjustable for different size feet. Even though this product has it's flaws for such a hefty price, it's still better to use this with the paraffin wax treatment than not to have a velour bootie on at all."
1,coca,Do not buy this product. The mitts do not hold in the heat and the bags are way too large. No refunds are allowed too.
5,A new classic is born,"STAR IN THE STORM has all the qualities needed to become a classic--beautiful, evocative writing, a gripping plot that will keep young readers fascinated until the end, interesting background and locale which will be new to most readers, and fully-formed, multi-faceted characters. Even though the action takes place long ago, modern youngsters will identify with the protagonist and the moral dilemmas she faces. Most of all, everyone will love Sirius--a dog for all seasons!"
2,Disappointing,"I purchased this book for my 11 yr.old daughter as she had absolutely loved a book that had come out a year or so before called ""The Wreck of the Ethie"". It was about a shipwreck & a Newfoundland dog. Unfortunately, ""Star in the Storm"" is adequate, but I think written too much to ""formula"". My daughter kept putting it up & down, never finishing it. SHe said it was ok but not that great. She said she also liked ""Hugger to the Rescue"" better.(Another NF dog story)"
1,Boring and drawn out,"My daughter read this in anticipation of a heartwarming story. That is not at all what I got. I was too wordy and drawn out. It did not hold the attention of my child and I had to stay on her constantly just to get her to finish it. (Since I paid good money for it, I made her read it through completely.)"
4,A More Complex Tale for slightly older readers,"A comparison to Hyland's ""Wreck of the Ethie"" is unavoidable since this book uses the details of the 1919 shipwreck (although author Joan Hiatt Harlow sets the disaster in 1912). Differences abound, however, in Harlow's additions of relationship complexities and her drawing class and cultural tensions between various groups of islanders. The book reveals a great deal about life for fishermen on the island of Newfoundland and of the immigrant Irish culture. The book would probably be meant for a slightly older audience than ""Wreck of the Ethie"" because of the various group tensions, but I actually feel the this book does not do as good a job depicting the shipwreck (perhaps because the point of view is solely from the shore rescuers whereas the ""Ethie"" offers both points of view). Excellent cover art and good prose."
4,"Somewhat dated, great vocals & bass playing, driving.","Although this does not show Bruce & Trower at their top form, it does give a fine example of their virtosity within a hard rock enviroment. If comparing it to Cream, there is no comparison, however Trower is adds what Clapton has tried to avoid ever since he left Derek & the Dominoes ""powerfull guitar playing. Although Bruce seems to hold back his fluid bass playing in order to showcase Trower, his vocals and the overall effort constitute a very good album. It's too bad the bad never toured, they wold have been an interesting trio to see live."
2,Jason satin,"I did not care for this body wash sadly. The smell was okay, but I feel like for some reason it makes me break out.I would not purchase it again for myself."
2,It just doesn't sound right.,"On paper this CD looks like a can't miss. But while Siobhan De Mare's vocals were perfectly matched to the retro trip-hop of Mono's ""Formica Blues"", they sound strangely awkward here. Robin Guthrie's music is pure Cocteau Twins, and maybe that's part of the problem. After the first few notes you just can't wait to here Elizabeth Fraser's unique brand of gibberish floating dreamily over the ambient waves. But here, de Mare attacks and ultimately overwhelms the songs. It's grating to the ears and sadly unenjoyable."
1,This is not the Mono you are looking for,"Violet Indiana's music is dull, juvenile, and depressing -- and terribly disappointing, because you & I so badly wanted more beautiful, lyrical music of Siobhan de Maré. I've been harsh, but this was so heartbreaking I nearly wept."
2,I really want to like this CD...I really do.,"Like Roulette, the music on Casino is strong, but unfortunately, unlike Roulette, I can't say the same for the vocals. Siobhan has a great voice, but the lyrics and melodies on Casino are unimaginitive and uninspired. ""Bang Bang"" is the best example of the fantastic music distracted from by the uninspired vocals treatment. I would recommend picking up Roulette if you don't already have it or waiting for Violet Indiana's next relese."
1,Oh Dear,"Let's get this on the table: I'm a huge fan of the Cocteau Twins. The crazy kind that will bid for Cocteau Twins items on e-Bay. It was the first Violet Indiana CD I had ever bought and all I wanted to do was like it. I didn't have to love it and I certainly wasn't expecting Cocteau Twins quality. I knew it wasn't the Twins but I was willing to be open minded and give it a shot.This CD is abysmal. It's more abysmal and even cloying after several listens. Siobhan de Mare's voice is pretty enough but had literally no dynamic quality to it. Awful, simply awful. I had purchased an iPod and was burning CDs to my library and could not bring myself to burn this one. Robin Guthrie writes arrangements in such interesting and dynamic ways and Siobhan's voice simply doesn't fit. She is in way over her head here showing little ability or artistry whatsoever. Who knows what Mr. Guthrie was thinking when he decided to collaborate with Siobhan. Her voice and his music simply do not go together."
3,For Hardcore Dave Fans ONLY,"An interesting collectors item and misc. info regarding Before These Crowded Streets. Has no music (except for Dave humming the melody to ""The Last Stop"" for about 1.5 seconds). Great for hardcore dave matthews fans (especially if you are an aspiring musician), but not for the casual listener. Not very long, either (I think the whole disc is around 20-30 minutes)."
2,I just didn't like it.,"I prefer the graphic novels to the traditional novels, but that might be a little unfair. It is harder to describe a scene than to draw it. Still, this book just didn't meet my expectations. HB's ""girlfriend"" (also found in The Lost Army) isn't a particularly sympathetic character. I actually found her quite annoying. Hellboy's father Trevor Bruttholm(sp?) is also written badly, acting one way one moment, and in somewhat inconsistant way the next. He doesn't come across as the brilliant man he is repeatedly stated to be. The plot itself is okay, but it just seems to go on for about 60 pages too long, and you can see many of the plot developments coming a mile away. That might be alright if the writing drew me in a bit better, but it doesn't.So, if you are a big HB fan, and have loved Golden's other work, it might be worth giving this one a try, but I can't reccomend it. Try borrowing from a friend rather than purchasing it."
1,NOT GOOD,"This is just tired sappy junk. It ain't their brother that's for sale. These girls have been for sale by the media since they were babies. They should stick to acting and leave singing alone because they can't sing for beans. They're cute. Senator, they're NO real singers."
1,there not good singers,i don't like this cd at all i like some songs but only like 3 and there like only one song that i like but this cd i don't like one of you like the olsen twins go ahead buy it but your going to be wasting your money when you can buy a way way better cd any other cd is better then this cd
1,Please... This page has awakened repressed memories...ehhhhh,"I can't believe they sell this worthless piece of junk... My feelings for this CD are possibly worse than my feelings for the Olsen Twins themselves!This is Olsens as we knew them from ""Full House.""This is one of the worst things ever!"
4,Great,"This CD is very good, if you are a Olsenfan. Some songs aren't sang by them but the cd is almost great."
5,Cute!,"This cd of theirs (their 1st one) is so cute, this music obviously though is fit for young kids, but I will listen to it, cuz Ive been a Mk and A fan forever! This cd is good to have for the fans."
1,ADULT UNFRIENDLY,"Although I didn't care for this collection, it did serve some good purpose. It has brought pleasure to many kids. If this collection has helped girls feel better about themselves and more confident in their abilities, then I am in full support of that. I, for one, can't stand the cotton candy tunes and the inane words. The girls' poor brother -- maybe if they really DO sell him, they can make even more millions and do even more inane kiddie tunes like this.Just try driving and having to listen to this for long periods of time. That is quite a daunting experience."
4,Brother for Sale,"Uh, the Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen ""Brother for Sale"" CD is good and most of the song is really boring. I enjoy listening to it anyways. i ACTUALLY LOVE THIS song called ""Peanut Butter"" the best! The Peanut Butter can be also be sung in the Snoopy album, too. ..."
1,This is not mosquito netting - it could be window screen if it was 8 or 10 times stronger,Bugs don't even have to slow down to fly through this stuff. I bought it because it was cheap intending to make new companionway and hatch screens for my boat. It's still taking up space here because I'm determined to find something it's good for.
4,one of the better health books that I've read,It seems that the number of studies in this important area are few - probably because the prospect of big-money profits is low; nor does government fund many studies that won't lead to profits for those who donate to politicians. . . a pity.
1,Into the Light - Tomorrow's Medicine Today!: Tomorrow's Medicine Today,"If you want a historical perspective on the H2O2 studies conducted during the past century, this is the book. I should have saved my money. I recommend ""Flood Your Body With Oxygen: Therapy For Our Poluted World"" by Ed McCabe. McCabe explains it so that the information is understandable and usefull."
1,Product does not cure as advertised.,"As hesitant as I am about trusting the pharmaceutical companies, I explored this option for treating my child's colds and gave it a try. However, after doing some research, I found out how these remedies are constructed. They are based on an ill-conceived notion that ""like cures like."" Hence, if you have cancer, you cure it with a carcinogen. However, to make the remedy more powerful, you have to dilute it to the point in which the original substance does not exist, just the water or sugar it was dissolved in. The entire concept makes no sense. The Wikipedia article explains why this product does not work:[...]My kid's cold did subside after a couple of weeks, but I'll try for something that is not just a sugar pill next time."
1,Quackery,"My mom had this exact kit when I was a kid and she made use of it frequently. She kept it out of reach, on top of the fridge. What she didn't know was that I would climb up on the counter and grab the box when she wasn't looking and eat the tablets like candy, because that's pretty much what they are.I don't really remember feeling any relief from using this stuff, but then if it worked I probably would have gotten sick from eating entire bottles, eh?Save yourself $25 and a lot of lost time and use actual, established medicine. This is quackery, pure and simple."
1,Useless,"Homeopathy is thoroughly discredited (seeTrick or Treatment? : Alternative Medicine on Trial,Bad Science,Voodoo Science: The Road from Foolishness to Fraudand other sources).It is particularly concerning to see it sold for use on children. There are documented cases where children have suffered long term harm and some parents have even been jailed for causing the deaths of children through relying on homeopathy instead of medicine.There is no reason to suppose this product should work, no credible means by which it can work, and no good evidence it does work beyond the placebo (i.e. fake treatment) effect. It works the same as a fake treatment for the simple and obvious reason that it is a fake treatment."
1,"Contains no medicine, this is a placebo.","Please be aware that ""homeopathic"" is not the same thing as naturopathic. Homeopathic ""medicine"" is based on the idea that you dilute a chemical until there is no chemical left, only water. It's a superstition that has been scientifically proven to provide no medical benefit. But people, especially kids, are easily fooled into thinking they are experiencing less pain or other benefits if they think a substance is expected to do that. That's what the placebo effect is.It's ok if you want to buy something like this to convince your kids that you're giving them something to make them feel better without giving them actual medicine which can have negative side effects. But don't be fooled into thinking what is actually in this product provides any actual medical benefit."
3,AN ADEQUATE CLEANSER UNLESS.....,"This is a very gentle cleanser from Jason. It would surely be appropriate for those with ultra sensitive skin.However, be aware that it does not remove eye makeup. If you don't mind using two cleansers, that's fine. If you prefer one cleanser to do it all best you look elsewhere."
5,BARTLETT'S QUOTATIONS DESIGNED FOR THE 21st CENTURY,"At age 82, with a lifetime of writing, speaking, and using appropriate quotes, I have purchased and implemented timely quotations from each new Bartlett's Familiar Quotations. The new 17th Edition has kept pace with the passing years and persons without sacrificing the wisdom of the ages.Joseph TaylorGrafton, WI 53024"
3,Good for reference but some essential authors and quotes are missing,"I like a good quote but this book lacks some of the more brilliant quotes I have read. Goethe's quotes are good but very standard and I have found better quotes by Goethe in other places such as the Stampy Says website and some of the more obscure German sites. Eliphas Levi is not to be found in this book, neither is Steiner.""Weak people talk and do not act, strong people act and keep silent."" (Eliphas Levi, 1870)Overall, Bartlett's is useful but the most insightful and practical quotes are not in this book, they are elsewhere."
2,Biased,"Bartlett's Familiar Quotations features 37 quotations from Franklin Roosevelt, 28 from John F. Kennedy, and only three from Ronald Reagan. When the book's editor, Justin Kaplan, was told that all three Reagan selections seemed chosen to make Reagan look ridiculous, he replied, ""I'm not going to disguise the fact that I despise Ronald Reagan."" For a more balanced book of substantive and memorable quotations, tryGreat Quotations That Shaped the Western Worldby Carl H. Middleton."
3,Great book. However used copy not so hot.,granted it was a used copy but this particular one had writing on it. I was not expecting that. Live and learn.
4,Ink tank with green cartridge expensive but the real deal,"Buyer be aware! As the box shows, this item includes both the ink tank *and* the green cartridge which holds the ink tank. I was confused by many other products stating ""ink cartridge"" which are actually the ink tank only. The cartridge was essential for me to revive my old BJC-55 which is now running strong again, thanks to this product.Especially since I needed the cartridge, I did not want my printer's fate to be decided by a ""compatible"" third party product. Personally, I believe a Canon printer should use Canon ink and I was not disappointed.The reason I did not give it five stars is at nearly [...] bucks a pop, even with the cartridge, it's pricey, but not having bought any other ink, as far as I know, ink for all printers could be expensive."
1,A Blackhole of Ink and Money,"If you don't use the printer on a daily basis, these cartridges dry up only days after you stop. Given that the BJC-80 is a portable printer, I only use it while traveling, which means having to buy new cartridges for every trip. A real money drain!"
5,"cheap, small","This cartridge is small, is cheap and last up to 500 pages(average) ... for house use is perfect!"
4,Techno at it's finest,"Most techno (detroit, belgian.. whatever) songs, let alone albums, tend to be rather cold affairs, recalling those heartless days of hardcore. Which is a shame, because neither techno nor hardcore were ever meant to sound like robots beating each other with large sections of brick-wall. This album is a reaffirmation of that fact, returning to the days of breezy melodies woven together from analogue synth effects. Beneath that, and slightly set against it, never enough to become fully jarring, is a series of rhythm arrangements that pulsate like a long-frozen clockwork heart, slowly warming up. Whatever the gliding beauty above, the undercurrent countermelodies have just enough chill to suggest that the wall of ice may be chipped in some places, but you won't get more than a touch of the girl beyond. One of the only techno cds I've heard that truly sounds like there may be a human amidst all the glittering packaging. By the way, I've seen this man spin too, and he is DAMN good."
5,Great album,this was one of the best techno albums i heard. I was very impressed and now a avid fan.
3,Bolland has done better.,"CJ Bolland's fourth full release is a bit of a departure from his previous releases which rely more on melody and harsher techno beats. The Analogue Theatre focuses more on a Big Beat sound, which gives a nod more toward the Prodigy than it does to old Luke Slater or Jeff Mills. Not to say that this CD doesn't have it's moments; it does. Tracks like Kung Kung Ka trudge along with a good groove and has a hidden hip hop feel. The title track is as harsh as ever, but doesn't provide the danceability or melody that previous releases have. The tracks that have a 4/4 beat are either too long or lack variety. Too few ideas and not enough emotion or drive."
1,One song and that's it,"This is so dated in terms of electronica. ""Sugar is Sweeter"" is the only good song. Otherwise everything else is generic."
4,Great read for those that like fantasy,"Great read for those that like fantasy. There is some dogma there and it can be repetitive, but otherwise a good read"
1,Sadly Disappointed With Edited Version,"As a fan of the series as it was broadcast on Public Television, I was greatly disappointed at this version of the final episode. My favorite scenes have been altered from the broadcast version. The cabaret scene from Victor's reunion has been completely cut, and the final song used has been substituted with an insturmental selection. I can only assume that these changes were made for legal reasons, as the cabaret performers are still listed in the closing credits. I deducted 4 stars because I was so happy to be able to own the series and feel betrayed. Can you believe it?!"
3,Not organized well,"It's funny. The book is not organized well, but each chapter teaches important ideas. The title doesn't fit the main idea of the book, however. And the audience it is written to are church leaders."
5,Masterpiece,"There are 5 Hip Hop/Rap Albums that I believe deserve the most recognition. They include: Dr. Dre The Chronic, Snoop Doggy Dogg Doggy Style, Master P Ghetto D, Outkast ATLiens, and THREE 6 MAFIA WORLD DOMINATION CH. 2. This album is so sick it is unreal. When i was first introduced to this album i never even heard of Three six. The beats, lyrics, and content of this album have not been matched since this album hit the streets. In my opinion, the best five songs on this album are Watcha Do, Late Nite Tip, Neighborhood Hoe, Tear da club up, and Will Blast. If you like good quality rap, this is the album for you !! Take my word, even though they have come out with several albums after this one, this one tops them all. A true Classic"
5,One Of The BEST Rap CD's!,"This cd is so tight! Every three 6 mafia member goes hard on this cd! My personal favorites are Will Blast-has a real bumpin' beat, Hit A Muthaf**ka-4 da clubz, Are You Ready For Us-featuring the Dayton Family, Prophet Posse, What'cha Do-Koopsta Knicca verse is hilarious, 3-6 In The Morining, Bodyparts 2, Neighborhood Hoe, Anyone Out There, Land Of The Lost, And Weed Is Got Me High. This cd is a must own for any rap fan."
5,Best of Three 6,"I personally believe this is their best work to date. Almost every song in here is great. this is their perfect album because ""mystic stylez"" and ""the end"" were good but not great,for one the production in those two albums is not as great as in chapter 2. Then ""when the smoke clears"" and ""da unbreakables"" production is top notch, but i feel it has to much commerciality and oh the camp dosen't shine as much as they did on the past albums and anyways every year i see the roster go down. but this is what makes chapter 2 so great because it has everything production,lyrics, and the songs are more well rounded."
5,3-6 forever,This was the tightest album. tear the club up thugs crazy in the last was almost as good. Gangsta boo single was OK too.
3,It's alright but it ain't better then crucial conflict,Memphis much love but 'um 3 6 ain't better than crucial conflict Chi-town fo life 3537 stateway garden projects peace
1,TOTAL CRAP,"You are pretty stupid if you think this is music. This is horrible, hypnotic garbage, and I'm surprised more people haven't crashed their tricked out piece of s--t cars while listening to these wastes of space."
4,tightest three 6 album next to mystic stylez,i got dis cd like 3 months ago n its tight as hellbut da only thangs is tear da club up'97 and spill my bloodda '97 version of tear da club up iz 2 cleanget da '95 version or da '94 version dey alot tighterand spill my blood has got da wackest hook and da wackest beatbut otha den dat dis a tight ass albumget dis shyt
5,Top notch,"this has to be the best album that ever came out of the Dirty South. it contains 22 songs like the infamous ""Tear Da Club Up '97"", ""Prophet Posse"", ""Late Nite Tip"", ""Who Got Dem Nines?"" and ""Neighborhood Hoe"".MUST-BUY, cause World Domination is a CLASSIC!"
1,Not as good as new stuff,I like 3 six Mafia's newer stuff alot better. this cd was borring. 2 dimensional rap. some beats were ok. but the vocals were boring. hard to boogie this stuff at all. wish i hadnt bought it.
5,"Finally, a personal account by a person with a life!!","I write as a peer and friend of Stephen Shore. His bookis a great step forward for our community. It is focused,practical, well documented and informative. Stephen is notanother ""autistic lounge act."" He is a mature, married,serious person with a life way beyond the deserved acclaimthat this book will bring to him.The book is especially useful since Stephen Shore,like most of the observed people with our condition,Asperger's Syndrome, is male. His is the first book writtenby one of the majority gender, after almost four decades ofliving this way, to give parents, siblings, professionalsand our younger peers a great overview of how to livein a unique way with dignity.A must read and a very enjoyable one!!Jerry Newport Tucson, AZAuthor of ""Your Life is Not a Label: A Guide to LivingFully with Autism and Asperger's Syndrome"""
5,Excellent resource,"This book was an excellent resource for me to decipher between the hype and the scientific data on nutritional supplements. This information held a lot of credibility for me because Sheldon Saul Hendler is an M.D. and a Ph.D. I used the information in his book and mapped out a nutritional supplemental program. It worked!! I felt more energetic and healthy. I researched this book on Amazon.Com hoping that Dr. Hendler had updated the information because so much has changed since the book was written in 1991. So, Dr. Hendler, if you happen to read this, I hope you are updating your book as I would love to read about the latest research on nutritional supplements."
4,ufo rocks well and solidly,"This 1982 release, which went top ten, was the bands strongest studio release since their last cd with Michael Schenker: 1978's ""Obsession"". The band starts off with a solid rock classic 'the writer"" which describes the now vanishing power broker newspaper or magazine writer who can make or break careers in music or politics. And from there to the end of the disc there isn't a filler song to be found. ""Feel it"" is probably the standout hard rock track on here; it can hold it's own with the best of their whole output.There is even a superior ballad on here 'back into my life"". This is highly skilled and top notch metal the kind in which you expect good playing and singing. And this would be the bands last great disc until1995's 'walk on water"" . The best thing is however the many bonus tracks on this disc and that makes this a better buy than ever."
2,Strange ...,"I guess anyone who rate this album five stars never heard UFo in their heyday, when Michael Schenker was the guitar player. THe band in this album is: Phil Mogg-v; Paul Chapman-g; Neil Carter - g.k; Pete Wae - b; Andy Parker-d. Chapman is not a bad guitarrist, but he cannot bem compared with Schenker. 'Chapman is just average at best. Carter was already a famous ""rent-a-musician"" when joined UFo. Added nothing to them. The mediocrity of this ""MECHANIX"" is so astonishing you cannot believe it is the same UFO that recorded ""STRANGERS IN THE NIGHT"", for example."
4,"NO SCHENKER, NO PROBLEM!","My ""old buddies"" might say that when Michael Schenker left UFO that was the end. Not So! You still have Mogg, Way, Parker and the great chemistry developed over many years of rocking together. Granted, Paul Chapman has a different style than the great Schenker (few could match the precise shredding power of the wonderkid). Mechanix is still a good Rock-N-Roll CD. I might go as far to say the sweetest ballad (slower tune) ever recorded by UFO was ""Back Into My Life"" #3 on the CD. If you'r looking for old school UFO you won't find it here. What you will find is a familiar sound and all the ingredients that made UFO great. Check it out, that axeman Chapman ain't no slouch! ALWAYS NEVER THE SAME!"
3,Poor re-mastering,Another fine example of 80's rock by some of the best. I am dissapointed in the sound quality on the CD. I bought this on vinyl when it was released. Sorry to say that my record sounded cleaner and better than this disc.
5,From our loving Father through Judy,"This CD is filled with songs that help those who have been hurt in life to run to our Lord God for healing -- He is the only One who can offer true restoration and abundant peace to a troubled heart. I use this CD in my home Bible studies and the subjects that deal with pain and brokeness, we sit back and soak a few of her songs in. The Lord annointed Judy - you can absolutely feel it."
2,High Chair,I love the design and compact size of this chair however I chose the espresso finish which I love but it chipped after 3 days and the wood on the tray is already splintered after only a week of use!
2,You get what you pay for.,"This multimeter has many good functions, but it is poorly made. Don't expect to put it in a drawer for 2 months and be able to use it: It drains the 9V battery quickly, even when not in use. In order to change the battery you have to remove boot and then the entire back (no separate battery compartment). I suggest spending a few bucks more and getting a better quality meter."
3,Nice but mine broke,This product does exactly what it says. I got it because of its high current reading. I left it hooked up too long and burnt it out. They are serious about the no more then 15 seconds on the unfused current setting.
3,"Works, kinda flimsy, battery DOA","I think this unit will do the job, but it arrived with a dead battery and is very flimsy. Plastic jacket is just that--very thin plastic, not rubber--almost no cushion to it. Jacket gives the impression that it will tear if it is taken off too quickly. Back cover of meter is equally thin--must remove whole back to get to battery -- again, I get the sense that I need to be realllllly careful in hanlding the back cover or ""snap"". I think it is adequate for the price and will do what I need it to do, but I wouldn't drop it and expect it to keep working."
3,Decent w/ Limitations,"This is your very basic DMM. It has most features needed. It does not have an auto-turnoff so you must remember to power off. Although it comes with it's own set of leads, it doesn't work with a set of standard DMM leads that did not come with the unit."
5,Great value,"I purchased this vom ten months ago and I have used it daily. I am really impressed with the accuracy,utility and battery life for the price of this unit. Great value and greatly satisfied !!...Rodger"
2,It's ok; kind of.......,"Well, this thing is not that much reliable due to either loose connectors or generally malfunctioning device to rely on when needed. In other words this type of multimeter would sometimes read voltage parameters and in most cases it wouldn't and when it happens than you need to start playing with its connectors in order to make it working which as the outcome is definitely not a good product by any stretch of imagination. My final review words are that 'I would rather like to send it back for a full refund'. V/R,Z"
3,Cost,"Didn't do my homework and found same product at a lower price than I paid. However, the Seller I would give a 5 star for service, ie.,the shipping time, condition when received etc."
4,Good meter for the money,"I purchased this multimeter for an engineering lab and it works great. It does everything I need it to (dc V&A, ac V&A, resistance, continuity (with audible tone), and a really effective cap tester). I haven't tried the IC/transistor tester yet, but all other functions have worked great. Only down sides are the test leads are rather difficult to snap into and out of the multimeter. I guess that means they have a great connection but I'm sometimes afraid that I'm pushing so hard I'll break the meter. Also, the image is slightly misleading, I was expecting the shell to be blue, instead it's kind of a weird orangeish yellow. All in all though it's a great meter for the money ($20)."
3,problems with multimeter,it took me awhile to get a working multimeter. the original one that was sent to me was defective also i do not think you should send a multimeter with a battery connected. also the instructions were no help in putting it together it only told you how to use the multimeter. so i had to send it back in and pay for the shipping to get it there and waited almost another two weeks for a working multimeter that should have been tested before sent out the origanl.
3,How do you operate this thing?,"How on earth do you operate this thing? Where are the directions? It had great reviews and I'm assuming it works exactly how it's supposed to but I had to watch videos on YouTube to figure out what continuity was and how to use this multimeter to see if I have it. Definitely not for the eclectically uninitiated. On the bright side, we did figure it out, had some good laughs while we were trying and got the vintage Pachinko machine I bought for my husband up and running in time for Christmas. So, it's all good."
2,"Works, but cheap and overpriced.",Battery was DOA and it's cheap. Capacitance and hFE require removing the component to be tested and plugging the component directly into the front panel.Get theEquus 3320 Auto-Ranging Digital Multimeter; it's much better.
3,"It works, but is clearly cheap","When looking at this online it seems OK. However, upon receiving the multimeter and actually holding it I was disappointed. It is extremely light and feels like a toy.That being said, it has functioned fine so far. In retrospect, I should have sprung an extra 30 bucks and gotten one worth keeping."
3,Seems to work just fine.,"The item works just fine. It would be nice if there were more instructions that shipped with them, but luckily I have friends that can walk me through how to use it."
5,quick low prices item,I had lost my extra battery over a year ago and find it almost impossible to catch all of those perfect kodak moments without an extra charge battery at all times. it was very low cost and arrived quickly.thanksfatima
2,Disappointed,"I purchased two Canon NB-3L, but only one of these two was OK. The other one doesn't work at all."
2,"Good, when it works correctly","I needed a new battery for my 5-year-old Canon ELPH camera that I was looking to replace, so I didn't want to spend too much. This worked about as long as the original battery did after being fully charged. My main complaint is that I get intermittent warnings to replace the battery even when it has just been charged ... or I get a message telling me to insert a battery when one is already in the camera. So there is some sort of miscommunication but the battery does hold a charge - it is just very annoying to receive an error message while trying to capture a shot."
1,Not the best spa music out there...,"I was given this series at the last ISPA convention for my Buddha Spa. We tested thesse for a week in our spa and had to pull it from our playlist. The music is too dated and sounds like it was made in the 90s. For the syle of music on here...general piano, some light guitar, lots of classical strings and synthesizer...there is so much better options nowadays. Very disappointing. Luckily I didnt pay for it!"
4,Pretty Awesome,The quality of these bbs are OKThey are SEE-THROUGH which means they're clear but green!!!SeamlessIt actually goes faster than regular bbs
3,Slooooooooow...,"Okay, you're probably thinking ""what the hell are you doing listening to doom metal if you don't like slow music,"" right? Well, the reason is, I like metal. Don't care what subgenre it is, I like metal. And I do like this CD, but would've liked it better if they upped the tempo a notch to maybe an old Tristania level. But it's their music; they like it slow, and that's cool. It is good, but the guitar work seems a little lacking for a piece that's mainly instrumental. The synthesizers make up for it, but even they are fairly simplistic. The vocals aren't very good, but the music generally makes up for it. If you like slow music, you'll like this."
2,This is a real disappointment,"Angels could be a cool album, but it's just not. I was looking forward to hearing the old Amorphis singer again, in a new forum. He's still awesome, but the rest of the band is just bad. The riffs are unimaginative and the drumming is simple and entirely too bare bones. Really, what ruined this for me, I think, besides the fact that it's boring, is that I purchased and listened to Evoken's Quietus before this album. As far as I am concerned, Evoken are the reigning gods of funeral doom. In fact, they really need to come out with another darn album. Quietus is intense, atmospheric and amazingly complex doom metal. Go buy Evoken's album instead."
3,"Dear Shape of Despair,","I'm very impressed by the way you are able to capture the feeling of sadness so well in your songs. I'm very impressed by the growling abilities of Pasi Koskinen (whose vocals with Amorphis I did NOT rate). But that's about where my compliments end. Sorry, but your music is just too repetitive to keep my attention. Repeating the same riff for the 400th time does NOT make it more powerful than than 100th time you hear it. You could have condensed this entire album into one awesome 7 or 8 minute song, but then I guess you would have had to come up with something else. I'm afraid I can't listen to this except as background music. I suggest you learn from the masters, My Dying Bride, on how to make quality doom metal. That is all.Yours sincerely,Some guy"
5,Bleakness is sexy. Really.,"Very much along the same lines as My Dying Bride, but with more sonic depth. Pasi Koskinen does the lead vocals (old Amorphis fans should rejoice to hear him growl again), but don't let that mislead you. The ""J.S."" (lead guitar/keyboards) person, whoever that is, wrote the entire record. Very long, heavy, dramatic, slow songs, but never boring. Sounds very cold, but with miles of headroom. Who knew doom metal could be this spacey without stooping to wallow in faux-psychedelia? The ""alluring female vocals"" that the label flaunts act as more of an added texture than a centerpiece. None of the sounds take spotlights, but refreshingly work with each other to create a massive -- yet wide open -- sound. A must-have for the beautifully disenchanted."
5,AMust Read,"If you are unfortunately searching for this book, then it is a must read. It is easy to read, unlike the volumes of text you can find on the net. It is very comprehensive, covering all types of scenarios. Buy this book, and God Bless the author!!!"
4,Liquid Hype,"You want early 80's stylistic art?..You want to see the 80's outrages? You want to see a microcosm of 80's ""arty"" excesses?...Then, this is your movie. It is stock full of what it was to be alive within the ""New York Art"" cognesinti circa 1982-- with aliens and corny pretentious dialogue...Unforgettable images, caustic quoteable lines-- this is a minor masterpiece not to be missed by anyone who thinks the 80's were a lost cause-- or full of bad music."
3,"Inspirational? ... no, but fun.","Kooky. The heroin-chic new-wave 80's meets ... aliens that feed on deviant energy. Drug addicts wander trashy clubs and streets looking for sex and opiates. My favorite scene is where Margaret's friend ""performs"" for the gang. ""Me and my rhythm booooooooooooxxxx...,"" she ""sings"" while her HUGE but primitive drum machine belches and bleeps. Cool clothes, cool music, cool stories, cool cheesy effects. Not for everyone's taste, but this is a film that shouldn't be ignored if you have a taste for the weird and self-aware, drippingly over-done avant-garde."
4,"Original story, good underground movie","Drugs and sex are a dangerous cocktail, add aliens and results are deadly. Original music, cult movie, adult movie"
4,Punk rockers and UFOs,A very quirky movie about the punk rock scene in New York in the 80s. A flying saucer thrown in for good measure.
2,Everyone wants to be a performance artist,"An extremely thin premise stretched across a tight budget...that's what you are, baby. Yet this movie gives us valuable insights as to what the early 80's ""New Wave"" culture was like, and along the way we are treated to bad acting and fluorescent paint and a clunky script and lesbians and little tiny aliens and a woman rather obviously playing both a ""boy"" and ""girl"" part.Nonetheless, Liquid Sky will remain with you, even though you did not live in Greenwich Village at the time and missed the whole party. I still quote lines from this film, and it reminds me of our shared experience of the 80's past in a way that its imitators like ""Valley Girl"" do not."
1,Worst Looking DVD I have ever seen,Fantastic movie made completely unwatchable. Ever-present extreme digital artifacts. Avoid this DVD at all costs.
1,This movie does not deserve the hype,"The fact this DVD goes for crazy collector's prices is astounding. Can you say ""dated""? Not in a cool nostalgic way, but dated to the point of being ridiculous. It reminds me of the stuff that PBS used to run in the 80's a la Dr. Who (but not as good). There are some interesting points that different characters make through out the movie, but it's really not worth sitting through. If I saw this at a theater, I would have walked out in the first 10 minutes."
1,Vastly Over-rated,"Sorry. I found the film vastly over-rated. Only the terminally trendy would see it as creative or innovative. If you feel like buying this film, rent it first."
1,Hated it,"I usually enjoy indie & cult films, but whenever I want to refer to the worst movie I've ever seen, I refer to this one. This film is filled with people that I found completely unsympathetic, doing revolting things to each other. If that's your taste, enjoy."
3,"odd film, not what i expected","saw this in 1991 and thought it was a cool flick. couldn't remember much about it (inebriated) so bought it the other day to watch again. i made it thru the first 20-30 minutes before turning it off. the person from whom i bought it packaged it and sent it out to me immediately. it was just an artsy, fartsy, surrealistic, sci-fi movie."
3,"INTERESTING, BUT JUST OK FOR A CULT FAVE","My biggest beef with the film had everthing to do with the overall cheap production values.From the lighting, to the soundtrack, to the cinematography, the dismal quality all added up to detract from the enjoyment of a rather interesting movie.The acting of the main character actress was amazing--she actually had me believe she was a real man at one point in the movie.I can see why it has a cult following, so it didn't surprise me at all when I resold my copy of the dvd for a nice 3 figure number"
1,Huh?,"People liked this movie?I can't beleive it . . . I mean this movie was bad. It was so intensly AWFULL I couldn't beleive it - I watched the whole thing in disbeleif, thinking it had to get better. It didn't. It was as if it was purposely made to be unbearable.The worst movie I have ever seen."
4,two thumbs up,I rented Aggressive and I wish I would have bought it. The film was real depiction in the day and life of butch women. This movie is ideal for curious women and those just entering the life style.
5,We Love Kisha!,"Hey guys,Please feel free to join my fan page for Kisha Batista onFacebook! Let's let her know how much her fans love her and want to seemore of her! Thanks!"
4,Life not a lifestyle,"I have seen the Aggresors umm 3 times since Feb 2006. As a femme I enjoyed the movie and finally being able to see the women/womyn I love so much. One thing I don't like about how the movie is being portrayed is this. The aggressors are NOT trying to be men, they happen to embrace the masculine part of their personality over the femme part. My question is this when did men become owners of masculinity?I enjoyed listening to every persons story in this documentary. I believe to a small degree people who had no clue about aggressors, stone butches, femme aggressors and the plethora of beautiful people we have in the GLBT community will learn something from this film."
4,In which we get to know Chad. Hurrah!,"Tite Kubo, Bleach: Right Arm of the Giant (ViZ, 2002)In which we discover that Ichigo is not the only member of this loosely-allied group that has superpowers. As the cover of the book lets you know in no uncertain terms, the enigmatic Chad, who was previously seen as someone who had no supernatural abilities whatsoever (remember how he had to be told where to punch in his first battle with a hollow?), may actually be far more important to everyone's safety than we thought. Meanwhile, Uryu challenges Ichigo to a test to see which group, the Quincies or the Soul Reapers, is more efficient at dispatching hollows. Ichigo accepts, with dire consequences (but sets up a multi-book story arc, so there you go). Chad's my favorite character in the series, so I loved this; I can see why some folks who have given it not-so-good reviews might not think there's enough going on in this one, though. ****"
5,If god wrote music....,"...it would be boring and trite compared to the glory that is Yakuza Heart Attack. Drums that would wake John Bonham from the dead, flowing synth lines cascading like a waterfall of bits, bass like the pulse of a solar system, and that trademark ""Southern Hills"" guitar stuntery all combine to make a grand stew of instrumental perfection. This album should be handed to every newborn baby to be enjoyed whenever they're developed enough to listen to this album without their brain straight exploding."
5,Yakuza=Wendy Carlos=Bach=Pink Floyd=Dreaming?,"If you have listened to the following 3 records, this will make sense:1) Yakuza Heart Attack - Yakuza Heart Attack2) Wendy Carlos - Switched On - Brandenburg's Vol. 13) Pink Floyd - Darkside of the MoonYakuza bring the rock, bring the education and bring the noise. Listening to Yakuza Heart Attack is like getting a lesson in cohesion. Sure, Yakuza didn't study under Bach directly, but the synthesized patterns make you want to believe that Bach found this four men in their dreams and forced them to create nautical rhythms.Did I mention that these dudes probably love Pink Floyd? I bet they do."
5,Perfect,Shipped to me extremely fast and in great condition. I will definitely purchase more like this. Used to do these videos years ago and gave them away. So glad I could find them again.
4,IT'S NOT BOGIE AND FERRER....BUT IT'S GOOD,"To do it justice it was excellent! But if you've already seen Humphrey Bogart and Jose' Ferrer in the Cain Mutiny movie then you've already seen the best that can be done. This audio book has some more and some different information but it's really close. The actors did fine jobs but better than Bogart and Ferrer, no. I enjoyed it as a comparison read and if you can suspend your memory, don't criticize and just absorb, you will enjoy it."
2,Please note: This is *not* the book,"Not a review as much as simply a warning. If you're looking for ""The Caine Mutiny"" audiobook, this is *not* it. This is the unabridged play...with actors reading their parts. If this is what you're looking for, then jump right in. If you're looking for an auiobook of the actual 560 page text...this is not it."
2,Worthless...stick with studio efforts.,"Think ""Got Live If You Want It"" by the Stones, but with slightly better sound, a more-obnoxious audience, and some disturbingly-inept versions of classic tunes which, while amusing, don't hold up for very long. This compilation of live Japanese GS bands from the 60s delivers essentially that, and you'd be much better served sticking to studio releases by the Tempters and others."
2,A toy,"I got this for my 13 yo daughter, who really wanted a video camera to play around with. The Aiptek seemed to be perfect; simple to use and not too expensive. Well it's not particularily easy to use: The picture was very difficult to get into focus (manual focus that doesn't seem to make much difference). It is faily inexpensive, but you will want to expand the memory (Compact Flash) which now is fairly cheap, but you will need several at 64mb. Sound is barely audible. If your budget is tight and this is all you can afford; wait a year until better products fall into this price range. You will be much happier and won't have to dispose of this unit. Our solution was to buy a well rated low end dvd unit for around $400. This is for the family, but she can use it. She's happy with the ""awsome unit"", and I was able to upgrade from my 8mm unit, so it's a win-win. (With her using it, her being a teenager and all, I got an extended, free replacement type warrantee, however.)"
3,Bob,It's OK if you own a PC computer running Microsoft software. It should have been plainly stated in the description that the video file won't download and run on a MacIntosh.
5,Best overall for the price,"I bought mine in the summer of 2005. With a 2 GB CF card, I can take a 3 to 3 1/2 hour video. The still pictures come out as clearly as digital cameras costing 4 times the cost of this unit, and this camcorder is smaller than most digital cameras. Of course the video quality is not as good as a larger, much more highly priced camcorder, but the videos come out well. It comes with accessories, which, for this price I'd not have expected, i.e., the carrying case and tripod. I don't know if they changed tripods, because someone posted about the long plastic screw: my tripod has a very short metal screw. All in all, considering price, ease of use, and quality, I have to give this 5 stars."
1,Horrible,"I have fine, oily hair. This product made large amounts of my hair end up in the shower drain. I'm not sure why, but this was a terrible product for me."
2,"Decent conditioner, but doesn't appear to thicken hair","This conditioner has definitely made my hair softer, but it doesn't appeared to have thickened it. I'm using it in addition to the Jason shampoo which doesn't appear to be working either. (See review on that product's page). Save your money and look for a different cruelty-free conditioner."
3,Not sure yet!,Received ordered products in a timely manner.I have fine thinning hair and not sure this product and shampoo works b/c I haven't used it long enough. I would have wanted to know how long it takes to see fuller locks before purchasing both products.One thing's for sure--a little goes a long way and may be justification for the cost.
5,Nice,"I received these as a present and I love them. The color and the design are something that is real appealing to the eye and I will use them everyday as they are on my counter. Nice seller, great condition and prompt delivery."
2,HUGE!,"These are HUGE, much bigger than we expected them to be, not at all ""dainty"", and take up lots of space. We returned it."
2,Pfaltzgraff sugar bowl chips,"I purchased this a month ago and already the paint on the sugar bowl has chipped in 2 places. the size is good and I like the spoon, just not happy about the paint chipping."
2,Too syrupy for us.,"My girlfriend and I were looking forward to seeing this, after what we had read about it - it was on TV, here, and we had also read the comments on Amazon, before seeing it.After watching about 3/4 of it, we both felt it was getting too sugary and sentimental, and we started to fast forward the video, just to see how it ended.Some of the acting is good, (not all of it, though), but we both felt that we couldn't take any more of the film, at one point. (We both do like films about relationships, romance, etc., but felt this was a disappointment.) Sorry."
2,not exactly subtle... don't look for any complexity...,".. this film failed to touch me. A bit too 'Hallmark' with orchestral accompaniment to scripted emotional moments. Well intentioned but trying too hard for this viewer. I would not recommend this film to others, even though I'm a real fan of Naomi Watts."
4,A Scott Hardkiss release always delivers,"A great album. But why is it? Well, I'll tell you. Whereas most electronic music producers are happy to go along with the flow and adapt to musical tastes, Scott Hardkiss sets them. His songs have a sophisticated edge to them. The difference being Hardkiss actually cares about his music, whereas others see the scene as a money-making exercise, producing second-rate tracks to get it.Without going overboard, this album is a breath of fresh air. With songs like the beautiful 'Born under a Lucky Star' how can you go wrong.Check it out if you're a Carl Craig fan. It's not the same sounding, but if you're like me, you'll see the similarities and will enjoy it."
5,music from a funky alternate universe,"there's not a song on here that lets the ball drop. lots of funk and interesting random vocals. ""columbo's got sloweye"" & ""born under a lucky star"" are particularly great."
3,does not come with lug nut to secure,"its fine and works OK, but does not come with a lug nut to fasten at the top. Otherwise pretty standard. make sure you see there are several sizes to choose from"
1,Looks good but performs poorly,"I wanted a stainless salad spinner since I could use the bowl to toss the salad after spinning it. I thought that the Rosle one looked really nice, and despite the fact that it was more than twice the price of the Oxo one, I went for it. Big mistake. First of all, the spinner uses a separate piece of plastic that goes in the bottom of the bowl in order to allow the strainer part to spin freely. However, if this part is not placed precisely, or if the strainer part is not exactly where it should be, it doesn't spin. And even when it spins, it doesn't seem to have the same power as the Oxo I had formerly, and it takes many spins to dry the lettuce. Tonight, after less than two months of ownership, it broke. Unlike the Oxo, which works with a pump action, this Rosle has a pull cord, and now I cannot get the pull cord to retract. Tomorrow I will go find a stainless Oxo one. That's a lot of dough down the drain, but at least I have a stainless bowl to show for it I guess..."
2,Not Good!,"I dont know why they even put Master P on the cover? He only got 4 SHORT scenes! The actin is not that good. This movie is like pamelas show V.I.P. Traci Bingham look like a black pamela. Movie is not good, TRACI IS COVERED UP THE WHOLE TIME, she doesnt show! Alot of other nudity scenes tho. Movie is a 2.5/5"
1,Wish i could give it a minus 5 starts,"Ok, from the title, this movie sounds like a ghetto movie, far from it, its sort of an erotic thriller but the cheapest u can find around. Im surprise that Master P's name in his the credit when he's rarely seen in the movie, its horrible, it shouldnt be out for rent it belongs to the garbage"
4,"good, not primo",This CD is good T-bird work..not quite as good as Tuff Enuff or Hot Number but good stuff...enjoyable and chance to hear early original T-Birds..
5,We love this toy!,"My 8 month old daughter got this for Christmas this year. The first couple of times watching it she only watched bits and pieces, which is very typical for her age, but now she loves to watch the whole thing through. I can't believe how excited she gets watching this DVD! She loves to practice ""hello,"" ""bye-bye,"" and ""peek-a-boo"" along with the characters on the show. My 4 1/2 year old daughter likes watching right along side of her sister. I can't wait to get the cow for Hannah's first birthday! Though it is a more expensive toy, I do not regret the purchase. I do agree with some of the other reviewers that the blue belly button light could be a bit dimmer, but other than that this toy is great!"
2,Eh,Not crazy about the smell but I could have overlooked it if it worked as a conditioner. Does not detangle AT ALL and I'm not really sure it's doing anything for me at all.
1,Not what I expected.,I bought this thinking that it would be a fab conditioner! Instead I found that it made my hair feel bristly and not conditioned at all. I would always end up using a REAL conditioner anyways because I want my hair to feel soft. I liked the Tea Tree Oil Shampoo but I would never spend money on the conditioner again.
3,"Good for scalp, but bad for hair","It makes scalp feel fresh but makes hair really stiff. The same brand shampoo made hair stiff as well, and after applying the conditioner it became stiffer. It might be better for oily hair."
1,Usually Love Jason Products,"This conditioner was a bit of a let down, didn't condition my hair and was actually drying to it along with the same type of shampoo. Everyone is different however!"
1,"Beware of dry, tangled hair after using","I used the shampoo and conditioner one time. This is an extreme clarifying product. My hair was like straw and so tangled that I had to use another conditioner before I could comb through my hair. It may be good for the scalp, but not hair. I will only use this every few weeks to get product build-up out of my hair. Actually I'll use the shampoo only and a different hair conditioner."
4,Conditioner,"It is a little to thick and doesn't flow out of bottle easily. However, it does cut down on the itching."
2,Mild but not effective,I wanted to get a shampoo that's both mild (so I can use at least 3 times weekly) as well as good for my dry scalp problem. So I paired Jason's Tea Tree oil shampoo and conditioner. It felt nice but did no good to my dry scalp problem. Hence I give the same 2-star rating to both the shampoo and conditioner.
2,not great,does not condition well. leaves hair tangled. feels as if nothing used to condition at all. would not purchase again. do not recommend as a purchase
4,"Classic Album, OC is a supreme lyricist","This is a slept on classic. The production, by such amazing producers as DJ Premier, is on point, and so is OC. He kills it on every track. Guests like Freddie Foxx and Big L shine on their collabs. If you love 90s rap, you need this album, now!"
3,ITS OK,"I love the song CHOOSE LIFE, but thats it. And whats up with the What I want For Christmas song? The album has to much pop stuff and not enough rock, it just doesnt go with the BTR sound. I love there other albums but this one is just to strange for me, im praying for another good ROCK album from them."
1,not all that good,"i heard choose life on the radio, i loved it. i also heard livin' off your love, sorta' good. so i thought ""what the hey"" and i bought it. i listened to choose life over and over. all the other songs were cute and stupid. wheres the old rockin' BTR? And then the most terrible thing happened, i got sick of listening to choose life. so unless you like really stupid songs like, ""will you be my valentine?"" and ""what i want for christmas"" or you are crazy and like listening to the same song over and over, DON'T GET THIS. all its doing now is sitting in its case on a shelf while the newsboys or FFH is blaring"
2,No rocks,The message is good but the cd is nowhere as good as the previous material released by the band. Its not rocking at all . What happended.Try again guys!
4,Good Album,"This is a really good album by BTR. I have never gotten one of their cds, but this is really good for their style of music. I would say to get it, because its REALLY good!"
3,O.K.,I did not like this CD nearly as much as I thought. Amplifyer is the best CD and I was expecting the same quality as it. Big Tent Revival is falling down on their quality.
1,The most ridiculous book I have ever read on my disease!,"I have the actual diseases and I have been fighting the ignorance of people saying there is nothing wrong with me or it is all in your head. But the stupidity of thinking healthy eating will alleviate the symptoms is irresponsible journalism. Where is this author's doctors license? I think it should be revoked. It is easy to write anything these days and to get it published, but there are people who read these books in the hopes they could find an answer to their conditions.This book, while it won't ""hurt you"", it certainly won't help you!I bought this book at a book sale for $0.50...I paid too much.Save yourself time and money. Don't buy this book."
1,You've got to be kidding!!!!!!!,"With all due respect to the ""doctor's"" medical education, I pity his fibromyalgia patients. I have lived with this disease for more years than I care to count, and I know others who are in my same situation. This book is nothing more than the old-time traveling salesman selling the precious bottle SNAKE OIL! While my doctor (a REAL physician, who understands every facet of fibromyalgia) advocates for a healthy diet and exercise, THAT IS COMMON SENSE FOR ANYONE!How dare this so-called doctor suggest that the BIBLE can cure fibromyalgia? Show me chapter and verse, please! Show me PROOF! There is no cure for this disease, and no one has ever died from it. Everyone is susceptible to fibromyalgia - yes, even those who read the Bible.POTENTIAL READERS: Please, please save your money and use it on something else - the grocery store, medication, a good novel...... This doctor should not be allowed to touch a patient, let alone write books on a ""CURE."""
1,it isn't the same...,"The CD is pretty good but I have to say something which I am sure many people will be upset with me. I do not like this CD because this arragment is runied! I did get to play Meij's Hobbit and other songs from Symphony No. 1 and did have another CD but it was better.. for example, in 'Hobbit' at the 'choir part' aka it is a calm part.. in this arragment it is strings but i what I played and the other CD, it is clarinet.. and other parts are missing. They should have left the origional music alone..yes I know I am picky, I am a musician as well and some songs I do not like (except Moulin Rouge..;) ) rearranged where some of the beautiful sounds are taken out."
5,Aweful,"This album is incredibly beautiful. It captures the raw power, beauty, and mystery that are the works of J.R.R. Tolkien. Johan De Meij did an absolutely wonderful job composing this suite. When I first heard ""Gandalf"" I got goosebumps all over my body. It brought tears to my eyes because it was so beautiful. Anyone who is looking for a GREAT album to listen to, who loves the Lord of the Rings, this is the album that you should get!!!!!"
5,Jesse's Lady,I really did like this book though there was some really drawn out scenes that I could have done without. I really like the fact that the author had enough intelligence to let me see his point of view-makes the story more interesting for me. But I think the ending was a little on the sorry side since the rest of the story was um drama-packed. I think if you ever get the chance to read this book do so and buy it.
2,Jesse's Lady looks promising but doesn't deliver the goods,"I loved her other books: The Bargain, Heaven to Touch, Gabrielle, Sabelle, A promise of fire and Highland Fire. But it's as if Jesse's Lady was written by another person!The premise is promising. We meet Thomas Jefferson and his um, lover/slave. And see a ""what if"" to a part of our history. But this being a romance novel, I did not get the romance that I was so used to getting from her other books. There was alot of build up between the hero & heroine but then, like letting the air out of a tire, the heat would just go flat! What a teaser and this happened all through out the book!Having read her other books, I was used to her use of the big misunderstanding as a plot device and I swallowed that but this book was all tease and no substance. This book definitely did not go on my keeper shelf and I do recommend Ms. Sattler's other books but not JESSE'S LADY."
5,book description,"Brianna Deveraux returned to a newly free America as feisty and independent as ever. Wild beyond taming and wise beyond her years, she met the challenges of a turbulent time with a passion that few could equal. - Jesse Randall was the only man who could match her indomitable spirit with his own. And together they dared to follow their hearts' deepest desires, and discover a love as vibrant and alive as their bold new land."
2,"One of the first books on J++ 6.0, needs improvement",The book was obviously written very quickly to get to the market. I found it useful when this was the only book in the store.
2,Close but no cigar...,"Upon quick review of the features documented in this book, I found it lacking in one very large area. In many of the chapters of the book it focused on using java.lang classes instead of the superior WFC related classes. For example, the I/O chapter focuses on using java.io instead of wfc.io which is more appropriate. It became clear that this book was a little premature and did not utilize the most important aspect of Visual J++ 6.0...WFC itself."
2,Very Disapointing: Nothing new from Documentation,"I was (and my team) extremly disapointed with this book. We have been working with Visual J++ 6.0 since the first pre-release in a commercial product. We were expecting this book to help us in the areas we are struggling with - to ADD to what is supplied with the product as documentation. Instead this book provides nothing more than a rehash of the documentation with extremly simplistic samples. The section on ""Code Behind DHTML"" is a mere 3 pages (should be a large chapter) and is totally incorrect - based on Preview 1 information. There is nothing on deployment. The so called Advanced topics are really Beginner at best. One of my team members just said he was going to throw his away. The market is crying out for an Advanced book on Visual J++ 6.0 and especially WFC in the areas of COM and DHTML. We don't need yet another book that really tries to teach simplistic Java - there are hundreds of books that do that."
1,"Should call it ""Adjust Your Wallet""","I bought 3 of these kits: one for a regular gate, one for a double-gate.The concept is great. But it won't last (unless you're in Atacama, where it rains once every few years).I noticed a small paint chip on the metal and a week later (we had some rain in the meantime) there was already some rust.I took one other gate apart after about 2 weeks and the inside of some of the pipes was already full of rust. I used some rustoleum (I got a clear spray at Home Depot) to protect the ""galvanized"" metal. Still shows rust.The double gate kit? It states easy as 1-2-3 with images. The problem is that there are no pre-drilled holes for the drop-rod kit, but you have to drill through the metal gate assembly yourself (of course, there's another spot for potential rust). I called the toll-free number (they have an answering machine) and when they called back they could not even tell me what drill-bit to use."
2,not good,"I'm a huge ELP fan, but this is a terrible record. Save your money. The chorus of the first tune ..""There ain't no turnin' back..from a nuclear attack."" Need I say more? Stick to Greg's gems on the early ELP stuff from Trilogy, Tarkus, and Brain Salad Surgery."
3,Tom Swift shows age,"Met, but did not exceed expectations. Like all books that are almost 90 years old, it had some battle scars, yet it was complete."
5,A Real Look at Creating Wealth,"I stumbled upon this book in the library a few years ago and was amazed. While the vast majority of wealth books, tapes, and infomercials tell you to make it rich and then enjoy life, Blotnick tells the real story. You MUST find the profession you enjoy and put your heart into it before you will ever be truly wealthy in a realistically balanced way. And even if you don't become wealthy, you've spent your life doing something that you love. A must read if you can find a copy."
3,this book is not current - Updated Revision Needed Now,"While I enjoyed the book and found much of the information informative, I was also disapointed that it's focus is on the 3100,3600,3700,3800 series and the MicroSoft CE 2002 operating system. The 3870 is the latest model referenced and it was released 11/15/2001, almost two years ago. Alot of changes have happened and this book is not current.I have just been introduced to the iPAQ world with a 5555 and MS CE 2003. Most of the CE 2003 Operating System is the same (in appearence) as CE 2003. After reading the HP users manual, which I found sparce, I purchased this book partly for configuration information of WiFi email (which is a major bullet on the cover) and troubleshooting.I found the book's information on configuration of WiFi email to be basic, almost the same at the HP manual, and there was little information to deal with setup problems that do arise. There are only 2 pages devoted out of 365 that deal with troubleshooting..."
1,How do I do everything with my Pocket Pc?,"Many words - few practical tips! This book did not give much more (-valuable-) information than I already had found out by reading the manual delivered with my pocket computer.After reading the book I still had to search for web communities, where some of my questions could be answered.My expectations when buying the book were mainly focused on the need for practical hints concerning how to manage tasks, contacts and appointments. Unfortunately, in my view, these important and basic issues were treated too superficially."
4,Fun book for the PocketPC enthusiast,"This is a really fun book to read. It is designed to help PocketPC users understand just what they can do with their really expensive toy. While it's probably not a good book for techies, since they will probably be able to figure out everything they're PocketPC can do pretty quickly anyway, it is good for everyone else.The book starts out pretty much how you would expect it: with a section on how to synch your PocketPC and other introductory steps. Once you've got it synched, there is a discussion on personalization features of the PocketPC. The book then goes through each of the types of things you can do with a PocketPC: make contacts and manage appointments, use PocketPC versions of Excel and Word, call someone on the phone (if you're lucky enough to have the PocketPC Phone Edition), take notes, access multimedia content, use mapping software, and even instant message."

4,"Seems like a good, simple primer for anyone facing a deposition.","I will likely be facing a deposition in the future and thought this might come in handy. I did not read the whole book but focused on the chapters for the deposee. This is easy to read, concise and seems to offer good advise. I found myself more nodding in agreement and refreshing things I already knew rather than really picking up anything new, but I will definitely be re-reading the day before a deposition to brush up. This seems like a very good tool to have before jumping into a deposition as a layman with little legal knowledge. Not sure how useful this would be to a professional."
4,"Useful, Handy and Informative","Nolo's Deposition Handbook is written using a format that makes is a very useful tool. It's easy to read and use. The glossary containing legal terms is invaluable in my opinion. The author uses lots of examples to ensure the reader understands the material being presented. I found it very well organized, with the information very easily accessible. This is a handy tool for anyone preparing a deposition."
4,Useful,"Nolo press consistently produces solidly useful books to assist laymen and even lawyers in legal basics. This book fits in that tradition and is very good.At the point in my career when I was conducting and defending depositions and preparing witnesses, this would have been a very useful tool for assisting certain witnesses in understanding how to respond (since they didn't always listen to me, maybe they would have accepted the ideas if they came from a book).With what I'm doing now, I'm more likely to be a witness as an expert. There's a lot that isn't covered at all in this book. It didn't have to dodge entirely the issue of electronic evidence which it did, and it didn't address certain special kinds of deposition witnesses (like those under 30(b)(6) of the FRCP). However, for a layman who is about to be deposed or a lawyer who wants a refresher of deposition basics, I think this book is quite useful."
4,posing an issue,"This is an interesting book from two aspects. First, you may wish to read it if you are likely to be deposed and want to know what's going on, how to deal with the back-and-forth of a deposition, and how to best present what you have to say. Remember, this is law, so this isn't necessarily about truth or justice but it's about how an attorney pushes on a deponent using advocacy, arguing, trickery, and so on, alas. Second, if you are an attorney, you may wish to read this to advance your deposition skills."
4,Good Guide,"When ""under the gun"" you need to have a plan of action. The book lays out intellient strategies and pitfuls to avoid.""Great book for someone unkowing of our lovely legal system.""Professor Hask"
1,outdated (jurassic park format) we are in 2011,"Please, let me expend my money on your products, don't force me to buy from somebody else.I have to decide to convert your version (jurassic park format) to ebook or buy similar content from somebody else, it's a hard choice but since i can't have 30 Jurassic park paper format books with me when i need them i'll decide to buy content from somebody else.Nolo in order to survive you need keep up with 2011 times.

1,This Book is Not About Depositions,"I just went through 13 hours of deposition time and let me clue you, this woman is only giving you the basic bs and I am going to write my deposition book, because the judicial system is at best corrupt and some of the attorneys are absolutely criminals and will lie and cheat - depositions are complexed and a detailed books from a deponent's point of view and with legal ease needs to be done.Be careful when you are being deposed. Just my humble experience and opinion. This book will not help you in anyway."
4,Graphic SF Reader,"Imagine if the Da Vinci was actually good. Then you get this. Set in an alternate world, where the Catholics still dominate, and the Inquisition are masked secret police, a doctor stumbles upon a conspiracy.Magic, a scroll, murder, and more. The writing and art are all very good."
2,"Too slow, too boring","I was pretty excited about this but it turned out that it just didn't do anything for me except I liked the one shot at the end. 75% of the frames didn't have any words but then in between chapters there were these ""newspapers"" that I came to dread. The art was nice but the style of straight on face shots was repeated so much that it became annoying.The writing for the newspaper articles seemed to slip into modern verbiage a lot. I'm not sure if the word ""terrorist"" was in use in 1933 and that along with words like ""press conference"" kind of took me out of the setting and into the modern day. Maybe it's because I mistakenly thought the time period was even earlier until I was almost done with the book.Overall it just went too slow and the parts with the most writing were rather boring."
3,"The good, the bad, the uh-oh","The story itself was fine, and it closely resembles Da Vinci Code, which they explain in the introduction.The product itself fell apart after one reading. the pages are falling everywhere and the spine is entirely detached.... in about a week of having it. This was supposed to be new....So I'm not quite sure what happened."
2,"Great contents, poor packaging","What a great comic! Unfortunately Darkhorse, the publisher, moved the printing of the book to China and my copy literally fell apart on the first reading. I was quite disappointed to have my reading enjoyment spoilt by such shoddy packaging. Contents: 5 Stars, hardware: 0 Stars."
2,If you like lots of demons ...,"I did like the Far Kingdoms. It was written very well, and whereas in other books the heroes go of to get some gold from some dragon, these ones just got off to discover new countries. The second part was still readable, but this part is one of the books I didn't finish. I got up to about the half, but the whole plot was demons popping up on every corner, and the protagonists exorcising them. Perhaps this plot changed, but I simply was to bored to read on"
4,Death Rider Costume did not look deadly,"Nice costume for the price and delivery was on time, but the mask was a bit small and the costume was not scary, but looked more for a bike rider. It was still convenient to have it delivered on time. Thank you"
4,Good movie on active heavy weather sailing tactics,Shows lots of comentary on preparation and active tactics. A little bit light on actual demonstration of tactics. Better than other movies on the subject though.Michaelson
5,super beats!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Mac-n is the man he can rap, make beats and sing to.I must say that this considering it`s a underground record that it's one of the best album I ever have heard!!!"
1,new formula = bad product,This USED to be a great shampoo - but it has been reformulated into slimy crap that leaves my hair as limp as shampoo from the dollar store. Great product made worthless by reformulation. Sad.
1,It's Shampoo!!!,Does exactly what it supposed to do and that is wash your hair. You'll get the same results from a bottle of Head and Shoulders. And at a quarter of the price.
1,didn't do anything for me.,"I didn't care for this at all. Not only did I not notice any difference in the thickness of my hair, I didn't care for the way it cleaned my hair either."
5,Boon for me!!,"I have been using head and shoulders for like 3 years because of my itchy , oily and bit dandruff-y scalp.(Yike I even hate to write about my scalp). Recently I saw Jason Scalp Exilr at Whole food market and thought to give my scalp a chance. I ordered it at amazon and tried. It was amazing and after 2-3 use my scalp was clear as glass. I thought to give another chance to shampoo and conditioner and believe me it worked like miracle. I was always afraid to try new products especially for my hair cause of my sensitive scalp and weak hair root. I will highly recommend this product for oily, fine hair , which needs volumes and oomph to its hair. This is my first trial this product and I am so happy @ my office . I go to restroom every now and then to see my hair.Lol"
1,ugh,"Where to begin. First off this stuff does not spread well. I never noticed any difference in the thickness of my hair. I did in fact notice that it made it a ton easier to pull my hair out (not matter how gentle I was) when I was shampooing with this stuff; a lot of hair came out, which is scary! I gave up and went back to Neutrogena Shampoo and my hair stopped coming out.Side note: Well, at least the shampoo didn't smell and Jason's thin to thick Conditioner seems to work much better; although I can't tell if it has helped with the thickness part...sigh."
1,"Frizzy, flat, super dry hair","I really like that this product is good for the environment, but i absolutely hate what the product did to my hair. I used the shampoo and conditioner for one week. My hair has never been so dry, stripped of all the natural oils and frizzy. My husband has been using the product as well. He prefers nioxin but is sacrificing and using up the three bottles we bought."
2,No Longer a Great Shampoo,Used this for many years and it was wonderful for thin or fine hair. They changed the formula and it no longer works to thicken hair. The shampoo feels like they added conditioner. Hope they bring back the old formula. Still a decent shampoo but not if you are looking to thicken your hair.
3,I love the shampoo.. but,"I love this shampoo.. this is the second time I order it, it works as it says, it does thicken my hair, and I actually like the scent of it altho it took me some time to get used to it... however the first time I ordered this, it was sent to me in a very bad packaging, the bottle was a bit opened so there was shampoo spilled all over the box where it was I figured it was a one time flaw, but this time as I received it one more time, it is again not properly closed, so the shampoo is poured in the bag where it was included. I suggest you seal the bottles, because this is very annoying."
4,"sensitive, accurate movement.","I love mine. It's very accurate for movement and works well on different surfaces.Better even than the Microsoft wheel mouse, personally.these are the downsides: if you bounce it , the switches trigger and the whole thing should be larger. I will definitely buy another one of these."
5,Excellent scroll mouse,"I bought this mouse for work, and I'm planning to get another one for home use. It's the only one I've seen with the sideways scrolling second wheel . I love the second wheel... with only a 15 inch monitor I am constantly scrolling sideways. The mouse is compatible with every program I use, and switches easily between windows. I use the second wheel to go from message to message in Eudora Pro 4.2.The only awkward spot is the third button - the placement on the side of the mouse means you have to have a good grip on the mouse to click that button.Overall, this is the best scroll mouse I have seen."
4,Just one thing,This is a good mouse at a good price. The only thing that keeps it from being a great mouse is that the scroll wheels are totally smooth. This makes changing weapons in some games difficult.
1,Mixed Nuts,"I am a big FPS (First person shooter) gammer and I love the idea of the button on the side, its feel is nice and the dual scroll feature is great when doing research online.The cons are that they are prone to fail, CONSTANTLY and good luck gettting them to work right after a month. I still can't get mine to stop jerking after the [...] drivers taht I got when I installed it the last time.My opinion, learn to use the keyboard."
3,"Smooth, but not the greatest","The mouse is very smooth, and I love the speed. I use it for work and do some art and publishing. I turn the wheels to scroll up/down left/right and it zooms in and out instead. Checked the install software for the zoom feature and it's supposed to be on the third button. As a previous owner stated, the third button is a little hard to reach and the options for the button are not as many as with other mice. The smoothness of the wheels are a little hard to get used to too."
3,Works but isn't the best!,"I have oily scalp and hair along with being very sensitive. See my other hair product reviews. I don't then obviously recommend it for oily hair otherwise it's okay. If you want better check my other reviews. It definantly adds extra ingrediants unlike free and clear which some may prefer- but, I don't."
1,Not what I ordered and not as advertised,"I ordered what is pictured on Amazon, Jason Natural Cosmetics Shampoo, Tea Tree Oil Hair and Scalp Therapy with the bear on the blue bottle. I checked my order to make sure it was exactly that.What I got was Jason's treatment shampoo---also with tea tree---in a green bottle and though it says on the front label that there is no SLS, in the list of ingredients it says sodium lauryl sulfoacetate, third ingredient.So not happy two ways, but not going to pay postage to return it. Would not buy from this vendor again. I don't know why it is hard for a vendor to match what is ordered to what comes in the mail."
1,horrible smelling shampoo,"I have smelled cat and dog shampoo that smells better than this, returned it right away, was leaking in the box too."
1,Not what I was hoping for,"I really wanted this shampoo to work. I have a dry, oily scalp. I used this shampoo for several days in hopes it would ""normalize"" my scalp. As a result, my hair was left very dry and frizzy. The worst part was that after a few days my scalp became extremely itchy and dried out. Brushing my hair produced massive amounts of dandruff. I actually started using the shampoo on my feet to cure my athletes feet. I guess the shampoo has anti-fungal properties. I would suggest using Joico Daily Care Treatment Shampoo instead. It isn't a silver bullet for my problem, but it has been the best I've found so far."
3,Tea Tree Shampoo,"While it was acceptable as a shampoo I had none of the ""scalp Therapy"" effects advertised. I won't buy it again."
5,Wonderful Shampoo for itchy scalp,"I've been using this shampoo for a few weeks now, and I am very pleased. It not only smells great but leaves a refreshing feel even after each use. My scalp can get very itchy and dry, especially when it is hot outside. After using this for a couple weeks my head doesn't itch at all anymore. Tea tree oil rocks! I just wish I would have found out about this stuff years ago. my roommate turned me on to it initially for acne and skin care (100% Australian Tea Tree Oil + FREE Tea Tree Oil Soap Bars). I used the oil on my face for less than a week and my face literally looked ten times better than it had probably ever. So within the past month, I've learned that tea tree oil can eliminate acne, cure an itchy scalp, and get rid of flakes/slight dandruff. What else can this stuff do!"
2,It didn't work,"Unfortunately, it didn't work for me. After 3 weeks using it daily, I still have the same problems. The 2 stars go to the shampoo itself."
3,Too much residue,"I ran out of Thursday Plantation tea tree/sulphur shampoo. I live overseas now, so I tried switching to this which I can find at the commissary.Thursday Plantation Tea Tree Deep Scalp Cleansing Shampoo (6.7 fl oz)My hair looks fine, but by the end of the day I have an entire layer of residue on my scalp and it itches like crazy. I'm tempted to throw it away."
3,works well,"The shampoo works well, but at least with my hair, it helps with the dandruff and the itch, but it's not anything super special"
2,Still Snowing...,"After trying other dandruff shampoo's such as Head and Shoulders, Celsum Blue etc, Tea Tree oil was the next test. The ingredients looked good so I was optimistic.After looking for it in the local Walgreen's in the shampoo isle, it was finally located in the skin care products and priced as such.Alas, after using this shampoo for a month, carefully following the instructions on the bottle, it is still snowing daily."
3,not bad,"I used this shampoo for about a week. It feels and smells great, and I noticed I had less itch, but I still get flakes. I'm going to try the dandruff line to see if that works better."
3,Tea Tree Shampoo ok,"I always use Paul Mitchell's Tea Tree Shampoo. I saw this and it is organic, so I thought I would try it. I don't think it works as well. It doesn't make your scalp tingle at all either. I think it doesn't have enough tea tree oil in it. I wouldn't buy it again but it works alright."
1,Made it worse,This shampoo did not work for dandruff at all. It actually left the scalp even worse with a lot of build up. Using just a regular shampoo and adding tea tree oil worked so much better.
2,Great natural ingredients but not the best results,"I have a drier, itchy scalp and need Tea Tree Shampoo to aleviate this condition. I was hopeful to get away from other products (Paul Mitchell, CREW, Designer) that contained many artificial contents. Jason's doesn't work as well for me as some of these others I mentioned."
3,Alright,"Just works alright, smells funny, didnt really help or make my scalp worse. Kinda made my hair dry out a little but not that bad."
1,Didn't work for me,"I have dry scalp. and by seeing so many positive reviews, thought of trying this product.Its almost 2 month now, and I can not see any difference at all.It may be because of my exceptional dry scalp, but I would not recommend this product based on my experience."
2,Mild shampoo but not effective,"I wanted to get a shampoo that's both mild (so I can use at least 3 times weekly) as well as good for my dry scalp problem. I got both Jason's Tea Tree Oil Shampoo and Conditioner and I have used them 3 times weekly last few weeks. The shampoo smelled and felt right. It was mild just as I wanted. But, it did absolutely nothing to reduce my dry scalp problem. I am looking out for other products now. I understand sometimes a particular shampoo cannot help some people but can do wonders for others. I still got to find my miracle cure."
1,Might as well have been Head and Shoulders...,"This shampoo did nothing for my severe dandruff that plain old head and shoulders couldn't do. I had high expectations, but was sadly disappointed. Then again, Nizoral has been the only shampoo to work for me, but since it is SO hard to come by I have to keep my options open."
4,Sigh,"I want to give this product a 5-star review, because so many people seem to like it, but as far as tea tree shampoos go, this one fails to provide what I wanted. I really like one that provides a good tingle as another reviewer said... and it just falls extremely short on that. If I can't even feel a little tingle, there's no WAY it's helping my dandruff. That's what I got it for- years ago when I was a kid, my mother bought a very strong tea tree shampoo. JUST tea tree. Now it seems no matter where I look I just can't find a shampoo with that same potency. It's extremely disappointing, especially when you're paying $10 a bottle.Another Jason product, the dandruff relief one, is helping somewhat, but it also only has slightly more potency when it comes to tea tree and so... the search goes on.Sigh."
2,Does not help - could have made it worse,"I did not like this shampoo by Jason at all. I am drawn to a tea tree oil type of shampoo for the smell and tingling, plus I was having issues with dry scalp. I came across this product and I ordered it right away. I was disappointed. I was hoping for a better more effective product."
1,Shoulda have read reviews,"The list of ingredients took me 15 minutes to read it was so long...That being said, use something that truly is organic. The more garbage you see in shampoo the worse it is for you IMHO. What a waste of money."
2,Not working for me as I expected,"I herd a lot about this product on internet. I decided to try, but it's not working for me as I expected."
1,Tea Tree Not Strong Enough,"Contains too small amount of Tea Tree Oil to have any effect on my scalp. I read in another review a guy saying he could feel the fungus burn when this shampoo was on his scalp. I have for real scalp fungus & this shampoo did nothing to help. The shampoo smells good & leaves hair very soft but if your looking for a Tea Tree specific shampoo (like most people who buy this) I would go with Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Special shampoo, which does actually make your scalp fungus burn."
2,"Not the Worst, Not the Best","This shampoo works as a cleanser, but it doesn't smell good, leaves my hair feeling dry with a very slight filminess that will likely build up over time. I will use it occasionally to purify my scalp with tea tree oil, but I will not use it very often."
1,MADE ME EVEN MORE ITCHY/: SO SO ITCHY,"Ok so it was good for the first 3days until I got so itchy it was so bad for a week , until I just stoped using it. O well just have to look for something else. It smells like rosemary(: which I liked. I have no idea why it didn't work on me."
1,Tea tree oil therapy - not for me,"I have oily hair and a scalp that gets itchy a day after washing. I thought itchy scalp was just something I had to live with until I tried a shampoo from Pytho that actually controlled the itching. Unfortunately that shampoo was discontinued. From then on I had went on a search for a shampoo that can tackle my itchy scalp.I tried Garnier Dandraff shampoo, Neutrogena T-Gel, Jason scalp therapy, and even some African black shampoo. None could control the itch in any reasonable degree. Neutrogena seem to perform better, while Jason performed worse than regular shampoo. Maybe the Jason shampoo was meant for dry hair?Finally tried this one called ""Head & Shoulders Clinical Strength Anti Dandruff Shampoo"" and finally I'm back to having no itchy scalp.Of course, different shampoo works for different folks. My only advice is to try the cheaper shampoo first before moving up to ones that cost 15 or 30 dollars a bottle."
4,Works well,I was having trouble with an itchy scalp so I did some research about remedies and this particular item popped up. I have been using it for around three months now and have not had a single problem since. I would recommend this product to anyone. I actually just bought a bottle for my boyfriend.
3,It's better than most,"It's better than other shampoos I've tried for my problem scalp. Even though it doesn't stink of tar, it smells like old books. It does relieve my sore head better than regular shampoo. I bounce around my shampoo routine with different shampoos for psorais because it seams to work better, (for me).I do like dermarest, and Paul Mitchell tea tree shampoo as well."
2,Did not work for me,"Unfortunately, this shampoo did NOT work for me! I went ahead and bought 2 bottles since it had a load of great reviews. I still have an itchy scalp with a few hot spots that this shampoo did nothing for after a week of daily use. I will continue using it for another week just to be sure but I'm thinking this isn't what it is cracked up to be.Also, the scent of this shampoo is not very pleasing.I'm very disappointed since this was not a cheap purchase."
4,nice shampoo,"I bought this shampoo to help me with my dandruff since I heard that tea tree oil can help. Well I didn't see any difference after using this. Maybe this stuff isn't strong enough, I don't know. But this is pretty good for a normal shampoo. The price here on amazon is half of what they sell in the stores.I also like how few ingredients are in this shampoo. Before buying I read that some people didn't like the smell. I think it has a nice subtle smell too it. I'll probably buy it again.It doesn't lather too well the first time, but if you rinse and repeat, it will lather up well the second time."
2,Just a flat piece of metal,Really expensive for just a flat piece of metal with some holes. Also it's not sturdy enough in my opinion. If I had to do it over I'd just go buy a heavier piece of flat steel and drill it as needed. It would cost just a fraction of this price and work better.
1,inaccurate description,"I ordered this item for a custom concrete sink I had fabricated with exposed plumbing--based on the item displayed, you would think that the grid is all polished chrome (it's not) and this grid shows an overflow although the description states ""no overflow"". This misinformation cost me considerable time and money as my plumber had to be rescheduled and the appropriate part had to be rushed by a different plumbing supply. I don't trust Amazon now and don't plan to purchase through them again. Don't expect them to stand behind the product or purchase."
2,Use extra seeds!!!,Only one of my seeds actually geminated. Get some extra seeds and put some more in.
1,ATTENTION! This is not a Remastered!,"Folks, pay attention to this release. In my opinion it is a complete fake of EMI or someone else, who propagates here a digitally remastered version of the original material of QUARTET. But, in fact there absolutely is no difference between the bad quality of the CHRYSALIS release from 1983 (CD) and this one. NO ONE! And the extra tracks are of a minor music quality, only interesting to hard-core fans.Buy this CD, but don't be disappointed. For me, it is pure money-making."
4,seller review,"I ordered the ""Best of Paolo Conti, 1998"" and I received a different album - listed above. I am enjoying the music but it is NOT as good as the one I wanted.I am disappointed at the substitute without my approval.Sheila Dufford"
2,Read something else if you want to learn about Islam,"Please pick up another book if you're wanting to understand the interactions between Islam and Christianity. There are many good books for understanding about Islam, and other books for those who wish to love Muslims from a Christian perspective. This is neither. It displays poor scholarship and recapitulates classic Western stereotypes of Islam which hearken back to the crusades. I give it two stars because there is some helpful information present on spiritual mapping, but unfortunately to those unfamiliar with Islam and Muslim-Christian dialogue, they will be lead further astray from a true understanding of the Middle East. I would recommendMuslims and Christians on the Emmaus Roadby Dudley Woodberry as a very engaging and informative alternative."
4,nice comp.,"the first cd is compiled of freestyle classics. mixed very well, i have to say. the second cd contains new songs. the only reason i bought this cd is for the new songs by nyasia, aby and david. i love the nyasia song. its the best one on here. i have to say though that i am very very dissapointed in david's song, seven days a week.i love david's voice, but this song does nothing for him. its been years since he's released anything, so i was surprised to hear him do this song. aby did it better on his album. and aby's song on here is just ok. i dont know what happened. better luck next time."
5,Very nice Irish trad...,"Solidly traditional material, tailormade for those who long for the glory days of Planxty or the Clancy Brothers. Indeed, the great Liam Clancy seems to have been an early patron of the group, and this album was recorded at his studio in Waterford. Singer Ciaran O Gealbhain certainly has the goods -- despite his youth, he has that lovely, old-man throatiness that makes Andy Irvine and the Clancys so lovely to listen to. The band also has a light, melodic touch. Great record with a nice mix of songs and tuneful instrumentals... If these young fellows represent the future of Irish trad, then I'm quite happy for the future!"
1,NOT EASY,"There are about 20 steps missing between step 4 and step 5.It took me 20 minutes between those two steps. (My daughter did a mosaic frame while I struggled, that she enjoyed) Nowhere does it clue you in on how make the pattern work,I gave up on the pattern. And after the I got figured out that you should start from the middle and work your way out. My daughter was frustarted by th 5th piece; its a very tight weave.I doubt we will ever finish this project."
5,The New Romantics,"This album came out before the release with the overexposed single ""True"" and is when the group was edgier with their sound, along the likes of Roxy Music. They were part of the New Romantic groups, like Duran Duran or Ultravox. Some great cuts on the album are Chant No.1, Instinction, She Loved Like Diamond and there are no weak ones, save for an experimental track 7 which seems out of place. This is a 5 star album even with the imperfect song 7."
5,"Review of ""Dancing With The Devil"" by Jacqueline Silvestri","A well-written and thought provoking story. ""Dancing With The Devil"" is an exciting thriller guaranteed to have you digging your nails in the edge of your seat. Ms. Silvestri's incredible writing style weaves an intriguing plot of fear, sadness, and love. The ending of the story left me cheering on the characters. Revenge is sweet when what goes around comes around. It was a spellbinding finish where justice was served. A marvellously crafted book and a MUST READ! ""Dancing With The Devil"" is a classic and strongly recommended.Linda Oness ~ author of ""The Tinkerers, Journey of an Alchemist"
2,Not much to offer,"I bought this for Beck's ""Deadweight."" With the exception of Beck's track, the Elvis track, and possibly the title tune from Ash, there isn't much else that rises above mediocrity here.REM's ""Leave"" is typical of their recent output (i.e., slow, boring, and formulaic -- and Stipe sounds whiny). Luscious Jackson's song is a one-note throwaway. Track 8, by Oh, is a monotonous two-note, 6-minute techno noodle. Squirrel Nut Zippers' track is mildly entertaining, but very, very derivative of early swing/jump.Oh well. I got the Beck track, which was what I bought this for. I was just hoping there would be more to like here."
2,Not bad but missing the best track from the film,"An eclectic album, the film has a vast number of tunes and the album picks from across the board reflecting the film rather than aiming for any one musical genre. However this is it's failing, you can't play it when you're in a particular musical mood because some of the tracks will drive you nuts, if you wanted it because of the film, 'Leave' by REM is not the version from the film (but still good if you're into REM) and the omission of 'Round Are Way' by Oasis is criminal given that it's the track that the movie plays out on.A good try but a miss in my opinion."
4,"very cool, but some songs are not the same as in the movie","While this soundtrack comes with some great tracks, such as the title song by Ash, 'Velvet Divorce' from the Sneaker Pimps, 'War' from the Cardigans, 'Love is Here' from Luscious Jackson and 'Beyond the Sea' from Bobby Darin, a few tracks are not the same as they were in the movie. REM's 'Leave', for example, is much quieter as this mix omits the siren sound in the background (the version they played in the movie). It's nice, but if you wanted the movie version (like I did) be aware that it's a different mix and you might want to download the original. For some reason the very excellent 'Don't Leave' by Faithless is also a different mix; to hear the version played in the movie look for the 'Floating Mix'. Despite these changes, this is a great soundtrack nonetheless (I really do love 'Life Less Ordinary' by Ash, just a great punkish song that captures the feeling of the movie quite well)."
3,Cool soundtrack but...,this was a cool soundtrack but i really wish it had the version of Beyond the Sea with Cameron Diaz and Ewan McGregor.
4,Great album with one kinda major problem,"I was truly disappointed when I purchased the CD and brought it home. My favorite song from the movie, Oasis' ""Around Are Way"" was not on the album! MAJOR MISTAKE. ""Leave"" also wasn't the same fast version as it was in the movie. HOWEVER, the rest of the tracks on the album totally make up for it, in my opinion. One of my personal favorites was ""Velvet Divorce."" (It's the song that Cameron Diaz's ""Celine"" swims to in the movie). I really recommend buying this soundtrack, especially just so you can play ""Don't Leave"" by Faithless over, and over, and over, and over. . ."
3,not solid,"I was expecting something a little more ""solid"" feeling from Delta. It's made from somewhat thin gauge square steel tube. It works, yes, but the Workhorse one I got from Home Depot for $19 is much much sturdier. I would not buy another of these."
5,Season 3 on DVD Please...,This is one of the best shows currently on TV hands down. Season 3 was one of the best. I have been so looking forward to getting Season 3 on DVD only to find out there is no release date. Why??? Warner Bros. if you're reading this please release The Middle Season 3 on DVD. Per episode download is not the same!
5,my favorite show - can't wait for release of season 3,absolutely my favorite show. Each one of the characters is perfect in their roles. Can't wait for season 3 - please hurry.
5,"We LOVE ""The Middle""","As former Hoosiers (we lived there 10 years), ""The Middle"" hits home with us. Plus, the life and times of the Heck family are an absolute hoot!In this episode, Frankie Heck (the mother) tries to discover her purpose in life. She seeks for religious fulfillment and things that will enrich her life and the lives of others, with hilarious effects.I highly recommend this episode of ""The Middle"" as a great example of what this show is all about.5 solid stars."
4,Not too bad,I have used a lot of tea tree products and this one doesn't seem to have much tea tree oil..it is a little strong with the fragrances but seems to lather well and goes a long way. Doesn't seem to leave skin dry.
4,cant go wrong with Jason.,My whole family has gone through a health change for the better. I started doing research for hair and body products and this is one of the best body washes. The ingredients are amazing. My whole family loves it!
4,Heard this body wash was good to treat acne...,"So far still seeing if it works to clear up acne. Smells ok. Feels good though and clean when washing with it, not greasy or oily."
5,love it,I was a first time user of this product and I love it . I like that it doesn't have the strong smell that mos t-tree stuff does. I even have used it on my hair and it left it shinny and clean.
3,body wash didn't wash,"The smell was great, yet it didn't clean me as good as I would have liked. It was more like smell good bubble bath, not body wash."
3,No Tingle!,"The reason I bought this is because I have Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Shampoo and I love the tingle. This product is ok, but no tingle!"
1,Not what I needed..,This smelled wonderful but did not clean me at all. I ended up just using it to clean my bath tub after I took a bath. I would not buy this again!
4,Fresh Scent,"I like this stuff!Having said this here are my reasons why.It doesn't dry out my skin,it cleans well,and It smells really nice.What more can I say? Not a dran thing!"
4,love the scent,"I'm on my 2nd bottle of this stuff. Love the smell, especially after a long hot shower. Lathers well and my skin feels clean. Highly recommend this product."
2,Not up to par with Jason products,"This body wash has a really faint, almost non-existent Tea Tree scent. I own a hand soap by Jason and it is scented just right, smells great and the scent is very potent.The bodywash lathers well, like all Jason products and has a smooth feel to it, but it almost feels unscented in its neutral representation of Tea Tree.If you were using it, you would not even know that is not unscented. So if you are looking for tea tree oil minty scent and, perhaps, anti-fungal effects, look somewhere else. This bodywash fails to deliver the promised kick."
1,Smells Awful,"I bought this awhile back and just started using it today. Others said that the scent was mild, but I found it to be overwhelming. It smelled like funeral flowers - and I still smelled like funeral flowers even after my shower. I do not like it and will probably throw the rest away."
4,"Good, but expensive","After reading all the reviews here, I bought and eagerly awaited this product, as I am trying to reduce the amount of chemicals I use on my skin and body. I do like that it doesn't have phthalates or sulfates. However, after my first use, I have to say that it did not lather very well. I had read the other reviews that stated only a small amount went a long way and I did not find that to be true. Only if I use the same amount as any other body wash (about 2 squirts) do I get any lather or feel clean.So while it is all-natural, has a very mild scent, and does make me feel clean if I use enough, it will turn out to be about 3x what I normally pay for body wash since I use roughly the same amount and the price is quite a bit higher than what I normally pay."
3,Disappointing fragrance...,"Lathers up very well for being sulfate free and all, but this product's fragrance isn't even remotely close to tea tree. Go with another fragrance. I even added tea tree essential oil, and it still doesn't cut the mustard. This smells much more like aloe & baby powder than anything else."
2,I didn't like it much,"First of all, it smells like old woman's perfume. I don't like the smell at all. Neither does my husband. Not my favorite soap unfortunately,, still looking for a better one."
1,Garbage,", sodium benzoate, benzyl benzoate, citronellol, fragrance (parfum). Fake fragrance and sodium benzoate. Never understand why they sell this at whole foods and how it continues to pass as ""natural"". I guess petroleum is natural, too. Too bad they don't list the multiple chemicals that are in the ""parfum""."
2,Good but not fresh scent,"This soap is pretty good. But I was under the impression that since it is tea tree it would smell menthol like, & tingle like tea tree does. Instead it smells like old lady. Probably wont buy this exact brand again."
2,Missing the point and ultimately lifeless,"Yes, Aretha's I Never Loved a Man The Way I Love You was a milestone in soul music and a testimony to Jerry Wexler's genius as a producer and promotor. And yes, we all wanted to know exactly what happened in Muscle Shoals with the fiesty white trumpet player and Aretha (but can find out just as much by deduction from the Rhino CD liner notes). But this ""book"" is an really an extended New Yorker article with far too much focus on MLK's funeral and irrelevant context with Dinah Washington and Billie Hollday - just how many times do we need to know that wx-DJ Louise Bishop is now a member of the House of Representatives? Want to capture the excitement of the Wexler/Franklin sessions? Buy the DVD of Tom Dowd - it's cheaper and much more fun."
4,Probably her best,"This is her most varied album before she got too many synthesizers (in Get Nervous). Excellent songs and more sophisticated arrangements. Not a bad song on the album, although quite why they cover Helter-Skelter I don't really know. She/the band do a good job of it, but it is superfluous. It doesn't deserve five stars because of the often cheesy lyrics (Fire and Ice is a classic in this regard, up there with Hot Blooded by Foreigner!). After all, PB is a guilty pleasure! Good, no holds barred rock."
4,Great Guitar Work,"I had owned Precious Time, along with Pat's two previous albums, on vinyl years ago; and they sounded as crisp and as hard-rocking as anything I ever listened to from Joan Jett, AC/DC or Motley Crue. Rumor has it that Pat even PLAYED guitar on these early recordings before handing the chores over to her husband, Neil Giraldo, though she doesn't acknowledge it in her autobiography. If she did, it was one masterful talent that got wasted."
1,Oh Dear,"As much as I love Benatar, this CD is not worth the plastic it was burned onto. The ironic thing is that it was her only No.1 album. It sounds very amateur (asides from a cracking version of the Beatles' Helter Skelter). Fire & Ice may have won a grammy, but all I can think is that the charts were lean on quality songs that year. Anyone who knows me knows of my undying love for Pat & Neil. This album is not testimony as to why........."
4,"Deep, Dark, Ska, Highly Recommended","This is not your normal British ska-revival record of the early 1980's. This isn't happy, teen-bop ska, designed to make 16 year old kids dance poorly. This is a dark, haunting, bluesy iteration of ska that has to my knowledge never been attemped before or since. For that reason it is a very unique record.If you love the genre of ska, it is a must-have, for it delivers an interpretation of ska that quite simply cannot be found on any other disc."
4,Ska with a creepy edge.,"Those of us accustomed to the fun loving beat ska of Prince Buster, The Skatalites, The Specials, and the skinhead fun of Symarip will be put off when first listening to this album. There is fun to be had here, with lively beats and those orgasmic bass lines that make ska one of my favourite styles, but there is a much darker, more sombre edge to this album than to most ska. The music is haunting, intruding, not the carefree skanking tunes we are used to. The lyrics of ska have always been darker than the music, but in this case the music meets the lyrics emotionally, making an innovative and at times brilliant album. I have the vinyl version, I just got it for five dollars, so I don't know about the asterisked tracks, but the original version is overall quite good, an interesting addition to a true ska lover's collection. When just getting introduced to the style, The Specials or Skatalites might be better representatives, however."
4,Basketball Pro,"I think this is a good book. The book tells about his life. It was not easy living his life. You would think that Allen Iverson was just good at basketball, but he was good at football as well. Actuallly, he did not like basketball when he was little. He just wanted to play football, but now he is in the NBA. If you like Allan Iverson and basketball this is a good book to read. If you want to know more about Allan Iverson read this book."
5,GREAT BOOK!!!!,"I picked this book up to learn more on ""The Answer"".This book is good for kids ages 9-12 years of age.It is a great book to pick up if you want to know some more of what when on in his younger years.I think the author could have went into the younger years of Iverson. He mostly focused his writing on his current actions and a couple run ins with th Law.But other wise I think it is a great book if you are looking to read more about his NBA career and College Career.But if are looking for more a book where it tells about his childhood I would not tell you to pick this one up.It is great for kids that want to learn about there favorite Basketball player!!"
1,Disappointing Cartridge,I maintain and use 5 printers that use the Canon BC-21e cartridge. These cartridges sometimes fail before the replaceable ink tanks are empty to a maximum of 5 tank changes (using genuine Canon BCI-21 ink tanks). The longest life that I have seen is by refilling the tanks before they run out(between 3 and 10 refills).I have been using Canon bubble jets since the BJ10ex and have had few problems apart from the short life of the BC-21e cartridge. I don't know what actually fails in the print heads but they generally fail with the printer unable to detect the cartridge type and refusing to operate until a replacement is fitted.
4,It has worked well for me,"I have been using this product on a Canon BJC 4200 for several years now and have not had any problems with it. I have replaced the ink tanks (both tricolor and black) many times and have continued using the same base. I don't know if I've replaced the ink tanks 20 times, but certainly more than 4 or 5.I find that its cheaper in the long run than on other printers which require a whole new cartridge. Also, I don't have to worry about the black running out before the colors or vice-versa because the ink tanks are separate."
1,Printerhead failures,"I read some of the other reviews. I've had my printer for several years. I hardly use it. I am surprised that so many users have problems with the printhead. By God, I am having problems too. Low use and after less than 3 tanks the head is dead. I think I paid $30 for it in a drugstore with a mail-in rebate. It's hard for me to shell-out $50 for a new head when the whole damn thing cost less than that. Guess I wont. Thanks guys.... Oh, anyone want to buy it? (...). Like new."
1,Thanks for Negative Reviews!,"Before I read the reviews here, I was beginning to think it was just me who was having a streak of bad luck with this dog of a product. All of your gripes are right on the mark, including the comment that the exorbitant replacement cost makes this a total scam. Thank you all very much -- you've done a good public service deed! Now I'll be dumping my crappy Canon all-in-one and buying another brand.I have another sad story about an expensive Canon digital camera with a defect that was too expensive to repair -- but I'll save that for another time and place."
1,Disposable society loves Canon printers and inks,I have a Canon model BJC 3000 and a model BJC 4200. Both are very functional and on their way to the trash. The replacement ink cartridge carrier in both cases failed and each costs more to replace than TWO new Lexmark printers (Lexmark model Z600 is $24.99 *including inks* at WalMart). There's something terribly wrong with this. It was irresponsible of Canon to engineer a frail circuit (subject to corrosion from ink) into its print cartridge carriers. I hate sending all this plastic to the dump.
2,Question/Suggestion About Cartridge Handling,"I too find myself with an aggravating situation: my BJC-4300 printer is complaining that my fairly-new BC-21e cartridge is not really a BC-21e. Looks like I have to buy another one. But I have a question: does it make a difference if one removes the cartridge to install ink tanks (as the directions say), or if one installs the tank with the cartridge still in place (as I did)? I'm wondering if this is what affects the lifespan of the cartridge. There must be a reason why some get longer cartridge life while others do not."
1,Shipment not Recieved,"More than 20 days out from shipment date and had to contact seller that I had not received my product. His comment at that time was reasonable, that he had to contact shipping and see what the status was. Two days later I received an email that they would refund my money. I suggest that they track their shipments closer. I really suspect that it was not even shipped at all. I would give them another chance but I would monitor them closer than I did."
5,Great Book,Helped me with my first soap making. A very imformative book. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in soa[making. I love it!!
5,for the alton ellis song alone.....,"I thought this was a great buy. I haven't heard some of these tracks since I was a kid. A good number of these artists bring on the funk. I love each artist's take on the Beatles. On the 3rd cd Alton Ellis brings the fever. His take on ""And I Love Her"" is hotter than the Beatles could even imagine. That was the jam back when. Not every song is stellar, but overall I'm happy that I bought it. If you are a Beatles fan who dabbles in reggae, you may not like it. If you are a reggae lover who loves the Beatles you'll dig it. Overall tight collection."
2,Maybe a good enough plot for young teen readers.,"I actually hesitate to criticize this book since I wish more writers would do as Elwood has done: refused to contribute to the degrading of our civilization in the name of realism, and therefore kept the language and plot clean. However, the poor character development of this story makes it disappointing. The plot has potential, though it, too, is weakly worked out.Maybe the action of the story will keep young readers interested, but adults will probably want something with more substance."
5,Canon BC-11e 4-Color Cartridge,"This is original equipment replacement color cartridge for the Canon BJ-85c portable ink-jet printer. No substitutes that I know of are available, need to use this one."
5,Great price,"This was a greart price and I received this very quickly. I will definately order again from this company, thanks"
2,Pureology,"I like to use new shampoos for the fun of it. I bought this due to all the positive reviews it received, but after using it I would not recommend it. There are other shampoos that do the same job for less money."
2,Not the same product as before,"Warning to fans of Pureology -- the ingredients have changed dramatically since P & G purchased the company. The wonderful herbals are now way down on the list, and it's now harsh and smells like a cheaper product. It also takes more shampoo to get a lather. I know this because I keep a smaller old bottle to refill from the big size. I'm very disappointed to say: buyer beware."
4,Excellent Shampoo,"Yes, Purology is more expensive than other brands, but it lasts so long - almost 6 months - and works so well - very few Bad Hair Days - that the cost is more than justified.This product is especially helpful if your hair has been colored or highlighted, if it's on the dry side (or if the winter weather has made it so), or if you have combo hair (dry hair but oily scalp).Finally, this $40 size bottle is a huge savings value. You get 4 times the ounces of the $20 bottle, but at only 2 times the cost. and you won't need to purchase again for almost 6 months. Definitely an excellent product!"
5,Don't hesitate,"Wonderful shampoo won't fade hair color. Highly moisturizing, which is what colored hair needs. Get this in the large size and you won't regret it!Obvious advantages:1. The bottle is purple - how pretty is that2. It smells pretty good!3. You won't wash your investment in your hair color away (which, if you are like me, is considerable)4. You don't need very much since the shampoo is so rich.5. Leaves my hair shiny and silkyI recommend getting the pump if you can find it. Squeezing thick rich shampoo out of a big heavy bottle gets tiring."
2,Pureology Shampoo,"I was not happy with my order. The shampoo is usually expensive and I was trying to save money by ordering from your company. But when I received the shampoo, the bottle was leaking and I did not get a full bottle. I have ordered the same product from another company and have never had this kind of problem. I don't know why it was not secured better. Thank you for your attention.Susan Redfern"
2,Bought the shampoo and the conditiner,You save a bundle with these large sizes. My salon sales this for 27.00 for 10 ounces!However I no longer use these products full of typical personal care toxins!If you don't care about ingredients then buy them on Amazon!
4,Good Shampoo,"I like this shampoo better than any I have used. It doesn't take very muchfor satisfactory results. A little pricey, but worth it."
5,Awesome,Its awesome. You have to use it for at least two weeks to see full results. Make sure you really work it into your hair after you lather it up as though it were a conditioner too.
5,Sulfate free shampoo is outstanding,"After years of buying shampoo at a health food store where I have to read every label to find the rare product without sulfates I finally found this product that smells great and helps to tame my wild, naturally curly hightlighted hair without causing the sores that sulfates leave me. I love this stuff! It is very expensive, but it lasts forever. I am not sure how they do it, but it is extra concentrated and a little goes a long way."
5,Best Shampoo Ever,"I have tried many shampoos in my years of coloring, i.e. abusing my hair, and this one is the best recovery agent I have ever used. As the other review said, there is tingling with the conditioner, but I just feel like it makes my hair feel fresh and clean. It has never hurt or bothered me. This product leaves my hair feeling very soft and in great condition. I highly recommend it."
3,shampoo yes; conditioner no,"The Pureology Hydrate shampoo is wonderful. The smell is pure bliss and leaves hair smooth and soft. Unfortunately the conditioner is not so pleasant. It contains so much peppermint that it actually causes strong tingling of the skin wherever it touches! Tea tree oil does the same thing, leaving the skin with a ""cold burning"" sensation, and I had to read the Pureology conditioner's ingredients thinking that must be what was causing it. No tea tree oil, just lots of peppermint. Softens hair, if you can put up with the burny scalp and neck (or wherever else you get it on) that lasts for hours after you shower!"
5,This product ROCKS!!,I absolutely love this product........I have tried so many different products for my hair and this is the best!! My hair was so frizzy and lifeless before and now my hair is shiny and managed. No doubt I will use this for the rest of my life.Pureology Anti-Fade Complex Hydrate Shampoo 33.8 ozandPureology Anti-Fade Complex Hydrate Conditioner 33.8oz
2,works but is very drying,"I bought the giant size of this nearly two years ago, it does last a long time! My hair is colored and highlighted and I wash it 2-3 times a week. A couple of months ago it occurred to me that my bathroom counter is crowded with about 6 or 7 different leave in conditioners and several hair masks. I don't know if it is the shampoo or the matching conditioner that I have used along with it but these products are very drying. That said, I think they do preserve the color and it's nice they are not tested on animals, which is a must for any product I use. When my hair dresser pointed out my hair was breaking off I had to switch."
2,"It's Changed, Used to be Great","I used to love Pureology Hydrate shampoo and I've been buying in in large bottles, I recently ran out and purchased another 33 oz. Well, it's different ... that's all I can say. My hair doesn't feel as clean or light AND I loved the old fragrance -- now it just smells blah. It's way too expensive for what it is...."
3,Just OK,"I have had better luck with cheaper brands from the drug store. This might be a great product for someone else, but not for my colored treated curly hair."
4,was it good?,"i have brought many items from amazon and i suggest you buy from only amazon, not from any other sellers on amazon. make sure the seller is ""amazon"". i can honnestly say amazon products are very good and you can always count on them to send you what you ordered. i have brought products from other people on the site and you end up with things that are not good quality.and i would reccoment you buy the whole being erica series, just imagine if we could all go back in time and live things over to become better people that would be so good"
1,Look Elsewhere,Very little help concerning water dragons. Better information can easily be found on the internet. Next to useless for the beginning water dragon owner.
1,Worst pet care book I've ever read,"I got this book along with receiving my new pair of green anoles and boy was I disappointed with the information! The title implies that this book is a ""complete care guide"", but that is far from the truth. There is no clear guidelines for exact temperatures, humidity or lighting. I was amazed at how they presented green anoles as a perfect ""first pet"" but then proceded to give little information for anything but an outdoor professional habitat inclosure. After reading this book I had no answers and only more puzzling questions."
4,live live live,"This is a good cd, the band made me feel the vibe, and the background singer made everything fall into place with her voice. jay z is the man. more artist need to mak live albums."
5,Just in awe,"I saw the televised version and I really have to say, the album is better. There are so many mistakes you notice when you only rely on just the audio but even the mistakes are perfection. The live version of Big Pimpin is, in my opinion, the hottest track. The fire behind it, the band's excitement...this track was the only one enhanced by the telecast! You could tell The Roots were feeling the song. Talk about getting lost in a track...If you don't have the CD, get it."
5,a master piece,awesome Jay z did it again. this will debut at no. 1. i just love it. no word 4 it. just buy it!
3,Really it's about the Roots,"Jay-Z doesn't freestyle or show any skills beyond what he exhibits on this studio albums. The only real talent or reason to buy this CD is to hear The Roots display their musical prowess. Aparently, in an interview, Jay-Z professes that The Roots only had to listen to the song list twice before having the entire thing ready. I think they added dimensions to Jay-Z musical style and did a superb job translating the synthesized music into a living incarnation of music. Jaguar Wright's soulful singing and the vocal sound effects of Root's man Scratch were among the highlights. Excellent job. Excellent wisdom on Jay-Z's part on choosing the Roots. Let's hope to see more rappers take some risks like this musically!"
4,New Fan,I just had to drop a little note on this album. I am a music fan first and foremost. I actually caught a repeat performance of this unplugged episode by chance. Thankfully I caught it from the beginning. After seeing this I had to run out and buy the cd as this is quality music. a great band backing what appears to be a great performer. Im not going to go as far as saying I am a Jay-Z fan but I do have to give him much respect on this effort. Good work Jay!! Wouldnt it be nice to see Tribe Called Quest doing something like this?!?!? Just a thought
4,4 1/2 stars,"See synopsis above.Well, to start with, I really enjoyed this novel. The premise was a little unbelievable but the entertainment quotient was high. I thought the characters were more than one dimensional and seemed to think there was depth to quite a few of them.The story itself was sometimes repetitive (meaning certain descriptions were repeated many times). This is good entertainment. I look forward to the next Zeman novel knowing it will be as good or better.Recommended."
3,not bad...not bad.. I wonder if Dante is with Beatrice now...,"Even though the Inferno is not intended to be an analysis of the philosophy of sins, but rather an implementation of Christian doctrines, Dante did not miss the opportunity to enhance his glory at the expense of his sinner rivals. A sinner's punishment was proportional to their sin, but the degree of evil associated with each sin was defined by Dante's own moral system. It was interesting to note that he considered murder less evil than fraud. Another interesting point was that it was necessary for Dante and Virgil to stop at the river of forgetfulness before getting out of Hell.The intention of the journey was in one way or another to find Beatrice, the love that Dante lost early on earth and was hoping to meet in heaven. Most likely, the Divine Comedy wouldn't have seen the light of day if Dante had married Beatrice.Nice poem, Dante's ego gets out of control at some points, but that can be forgiven, given the artistic work he created."
4,"Fantastic Read, when you're ready for it.","My love/hate affair with the Divine Comedy began many years ago. A literature teacher got me interested in it, but at that age I couldn't grasp it for what it was. I read the words but didn't feel them. I tried again several more times, with various versions, sometimes the entire Divine Comedy, at other times, only the Inferno.I found several versions I liked, but then a few years ago I picked up this edition and loved it! To me, Pinsky's translation makes this masterpiece far more accessible than any of the others. It is the one they should use in schools. From time to time I go back to it and read through and it never loses its luster.I highly recommend this for anyone interested in delving into one of the greatest works of literature of all time."
1,Penn Student,"I am an honor student at an ivy league university trying to cram this book for a final in a Comp Lit. class and boy it is almost too much to take. The sheer boredom! This is what people at the time thought was exciting and spellbinding. Since Star Wars, this book is most definately dated. What is the purpose of reading this today when we have advanced so much, and can make entertainment that is a thousand times more interesting? Don't waste your time on this very boring and pointless book. I hate it!"
5,Good purchase,I bought 3 CD's for a good price. The delivery was fast and reliable. I love Amazon and they are really trustable.
2,"This Review is for Amazon, not CD",First let me say that this is my favorite Huey Lewis & The News album. I can't say there is even one song I dislike. Now on to Amazon...My husband bought this cd for me LAST YEAR from Amazon along with several other cds. Just recently I discovered charges on my credit card from Amazon for orders I haven't placed. It turns out that they were repeating an order from 12/07 that included this cd and even shipped it to my old address!! What is going on with your shipping department??!! At least they refunded my money since I didn't order it and never received it either. Someone at my old address is enjoying some cds on Amazon.
5,An Excellent Single by a Promising New Artist,"Tara Lyn Hart's 2000 single shows the promise of a great new artist. Unfortunately, the album never was released and I assume it never will be. (I searched the Web in vain for months, wating for the album!)I realize that record companies must made a large investment, and take a corresponding gamble, on new artists, but Tara Lyn definitely has what it takes to be a successful country music recording artist, and I was very disappointed when an album never came out.(The same is true for artist Shannon Brown, whose 1998 country music single showed great promise; again, no album was ever released.)"
4,great product,"I really enjoyed this product. It came with four different ear pieces and two of them fit really well. If you are going to buy this product, make sure to buy it with the communicator. The only problem i found with this product is that the cord is pretty sort so it gets in the way. For sure worth the 49.00 dollars."
1,False Picture and title - communicator not included!!!,"Why are people allowed to Say ""with communicator"" if they are not including it?? This is bull and Amazon should not allow this deceptive stuff....."
1,terrible and predictable,"my mother was right..this movie is terrible! the family stone are a bunch of mean spirited, selfish, freaks that treat sarah jessica parker's character like complete trash. i didn't want to see this movie, yet the fact that luke wilson was in it got me a little interested.it's a drama/comedy dysfunctional family type movie that makes you want to call your mother by the end of the movie.i called my mother for more reasons than one. I don't know what an actress of Diane Keaton's status was doing in this. i felt so indifferent about her character through out which made the movie that much more frustrating to watch. I am not a Sarah Jessica Parker fan, but i actually was routing for her character after peeking into the Stone Familys'(her boyfriend - played by Dermot Mulroney) lives.if you want to watch a film about holidays and dysfunction that isn't so mean spirited, i recommend ""home for the holidays"" over this piece of garbage."
1,Haven't I seen this movie before?,"The Family Stone uses the age old formula to make yet another crappy romantic comedy. Stuffy, conservative, successful person meets their significant other's dysfunctional family. Just another cookie cutter romantic comedy (which isn't that funny). Don't waste your time."
2,The Family With No Manners,"Everett Stone (Dermot Mulroney, as wooden as usual) brings his girlfriend, played by Sarah Jessica Parker, home for Christmas to meet his family. He wants to ask for the family stone (which his mother promised him) to ask her to marry him. Diane Keaton (his mom)keeps referring to it as a wedding ring, but it's clearly an engagement ring. In any case, everyone in his family (except his brother Ben) is extremely hateful towards her, causing her to call her sister (Claire Danes) for moral support and move into a hotel for the duration.The whole thing about the bedrooms is silly. Why can't the two brothers share? Why can't the two girls share? Why is the gay deaf son with a hearing man? That's not likely. Half the time the family uses sign language, the other half, he's somehow expected to read lips when someone is not even facing him.[...]a waste of two hours."
1,"Predictable, Overwrought, Boring","I managed to make it through the first hour and that was it...I had thought, with such a stellar cast, how could anything go wrong? Everything went wrong..."
1,Borrrrrriiing,yawn boring boring when does the plot develop? oh it did! and I didnt care. The characters arent likeable. jkk
2,Not as Advertised,"I was very excited about this movie after seeing the commercials. Sadly, the movie itself is not as entertaining as its trailers. The parts that are shown in the trailer are the only funny parts of the film. The rest of the movie goes back and forth between trying to tackle controversial social issues and being a light hearted romantic tale. I wasn't sure whether to be uncomfortable or amused.The acting is phenomenal, Rachel McAdams is particularly good as the snarky sister. More scenes with her might have added some life to several slow scenes. The ending is also utterly implausible in my brain at least.The story had so much potential...isn't it sad that not much was done with it?"
2,Boring,It bored the heck out of me. SJP plays the same character in every movie she's in. I don't understand her appeal. She bores me to tears!
3,not the msot typical tearjerker - but also rather outlandish,"This family holiday comedy is bittersweet. It's a very pleasant film and the ensemble cast fits wonderfully together. Claire Danes (Shopgirl, My So-Called Life) has grown up quite nicely and looks stunning in this movie. Rachel McAdams (Wedding Crashers, Red Eye) provides most of the comedic relief for the movie. Diane Keaton's performance is touching and delightful, as always."
2,Great cast largely wasted,"A big ensemble comedy-drama about a modern, diverse family. A cast that includes Diane Keaton, Rachel McAdams, Dermot Mulroney, Craig T. Nelson, Sarah Jessica Parker (in a rare unsympathetic role), and Luke Wilson.This is the sort of movie you watch to convince yourself that you're not as screwed up as these people. (Trust me--you aren't, unless your parents are hack screenwriters in Hollywood.) Rated PG-13."
5,The family Stone,"this has always been a family christmas movie since it came out love it love it , i just bought it for my daughter i have had it for years"
4,A new holiday classic,Underrated holiday movie. I can't believe it wasn'ton tv this past holiday season. I was forced to buy as it is part of our family tradition to watch it. We look forward to watching it every Christmas.
4,All Families are Nuts :),Entertaining with lots of humor though I didn't expect the sad elements of the film. Just be prepared that it will cause some sadness for the more sensitive crowd.
5,Great Movie,"Great movie for the holiday, makes you think not ever family is perfect. I would recommend great actors and actreses"
5,Love this movie!,"I've watched this a million times and it never gets old! I watch it all year, but it has become a Christmas tradition."
4,This more than met my critical eye...,"Pay attention to this seemingly inconsequential film. The magic of this little gem is in what the actors don't say. The depth of the performances are in the facial expressions of all of these actors. You'll know how each character feels about what's happening by reading their faces, rather than the script. Luke Wilson and Rachel McAdam are particularly noteworthy.Audacious in their awful behavior, touching in their honesty, the Stones behave as badly, and a bit better, than the rest of us. You'll laugh, and if you have a heart you'll think about crying. I enjoyed the heck out of it and cried a bit myself."
1,yikes,"""Laugh-out-loud hillarious! smart! Moving! one of the year's best!"" The new york observer must have had a few drinks before watching this movie. Sarah Jessica Parker is not funny as a stuck up business woman, just not believeable after her fantastic role in Sex & the city where she has an amazing personality that shines. The family absolutely hates her and in every scene she runs out crying-really funny huh? I was so irritated by each character in this film, the script was awful and did anyone actually get the ""family stone"" in the end? if they did-i didn't see, i left the room."
3,Expected Better,"I have friends that like this movie, but not for me. The previews are much better than the actually movie. I prefer Failure to Lauch."
4,I Rather Enjoyed It,"I am so sick of people writing in giving negative reviews of some of these movies that are rather good. Everybody wants to be another Siskel and Ebert. I liked ""The Family Stone"" a lot. Firstly, it was refreshing seeing Sarah Jessica Parker not acting like her usual bubbly character of Carrie from ""Sex In The City"". She actually showed an acting range, which was great. Again, it's one for your ""chick flick"" pile. It has romance, and I found it laugh out loud funny, especially the mishaps on Christmas morning. It's difinitely a great Christmas movie so I'd put it in with the Christmas movie pile also. It wasn't the greatest of all time dysfunctional family movie but it was very good and definitely worth watching."
1,Less than one star PLEASE!,"My wife and I left this movie before it finished. It was the most hate filled uncomfortable movie I've been to, EVER. How in the world anyone can like this is beyond me. If my family was like this one I would never bring a future bride to meet them. I love movies (have over 1000 DVDs) but I want my money back from the people that made this floater. We should file a law suit for them even using the term movie in conjuction with this thing."
1,terrible movie,it was boring. i didnt like this movie at all. could i please have my money refunded to me? thank you
4,unseen,Have not seen this movie; purchased it as a gift. I'm sure my daughter and son-in -law have enjoyed watching the movie.
2,Just Bad,"I rented this movie because I thought it was a comedy..according to the previews it seemed like it was. The cast was great but the movie was awful. The film tells the story of uptight businesswoman Meredith (Sarah Jessica Parker) who meets the parents of her boyfriend Everett Stone (Dermot Mulroney) for the first time during the Christmas celebrations. From the get go, The Stones don't like Meredith, so she calls her sister Julie (Claire Danes) to come back her up.I think the main reason for me that this movie was so awful is that every character in this movie was so dreadfully and disgustingly dysfunctional and the film offered me nothing to hope for with no chance whatsoever to even like ANY of the characters.Save your money and save your time. This movie is unfortunately not worth it. If you want to see a dysfunctional family, watch 'Arrested Development', the best written show since Seinfeld.This is not a comedy. This is not a charming holiday film. It is an utterly dumb movie."
2,Your Family Has to be Stoned to Enjoy The Family Stone.,"I rented this movie yesterday only to realize that I'd rented it last week, except it was called In Her Shoes and about one star better than this. Okay, I felt sorry for Sarah Jessica Parker's character, but this movie was sad in that it wasn't one bit moving or convincing. You could see which brother was going to end up with which sister the moment both pairs first laid eyes on each other, and Diane Keaton's skunk hair was almost as distracting as her mere presence is in most films. She was dying in THIS movie? Let's go way back to Annie Hall and tell me that again. There is more chemistry between two 300 year-old corpses than any of the cast members of this so-called comedy (I laughed once), and it's a waste of time for somebody as talented as Craig T. Nelson. I agree with another reviewer here; want a good Christmas themed movie with several characters and storylines that are both funny and touching? Get your hands on Love Actually instead!"
5,One of the BEST movies - One of My Favorites!,"Despite of all the other NEG reviews - this movie is one of my favorites. I have watched it 6 times on HBO and just decided to out right buy it! It's a keeper for the DVD library. This movie is about FAMILY. Dysfunctional...maybe, but WHO lives in a ""Brady Bunch"" family? As far as I am concerned ALL and MOST families have DRAMA in them and that's what makes them family. This story is about a family dealing with there own share of DRAMA. As a matter of fact, I see a couple of my family members in this family:-) See it and enjoy - it is truly a GREAT film."
3,The (dysfunctional) Family Stone,"Take a family's annual Christmas get-together. Throw in a new person or two, preferable neurotic, parents who still rule the roost with their adult children (who still act like very un-adult children), some booze, and a biracial gay couple. Mix them together on Christmas Eve, with a bit of carryover to Christmas Day. You get... The Family Stone.It has its humorous moments, but the wackiness of the family crosses the believability barrier, distracting from the tense familial interactions.This one won't replace White Christmas anytime soon as a Christmas classic. However, it sure brought smiles, and tears, to some of its viewers. Perhaps that is the criteria by which The Family Stone should be judged."
4,Entertaining Christmas movie to enjoy all year long...,"I am a Diane Keaton fan, especially after ""Something's Gotta Give"". She again comes through with an excellent performance here; but this movie was surprisingly captivating watching a family deal with change. It was hiliariously funny at times with Sarah Jessica Parker's character being the family's focus as the elder brother's potential new wife, yet it captures the politics and drama of a typical American family when it gets together for that few days at Christmas. All in all a very entertaining movie."
4,"Not a comedy, but comic relief.","This movie might come with a flag for those who are cancer survivors, or those who survive without someone. It is about the rock solidarity found in a family when the facade is stripped away and we can laugh at ourselves and each other in order to continue, even when we know we won't."
2,The first 20min were good,"This movie started off so good and then it just completely fell apart. Once Luke Wilson comes into the picture and sees Sarah Jessica Parker you pretty much know how this movie is going to turn out. And then her fiance gets his first glimpse at her sister and he's already found a new love. I just didn't buy it at all. What I really liked watching was Sarah Jessica Parker as this shy, out of place person trying to fit into this family. But in the end, we never really get to see her accepted as one of them. We never get that moment between her and Diane Keaton. The movie just skips ahead a year after she's dead and everybody has moved on. Really disappointing."
1,Hollywood takes the joy out of Xmas,"I too had an open mind to this movie. But your mind can be open only so much. Let me first state, that this movie had a chance if it had a ""hopeful/holiday"" script. (They defintiely had the actors). But it doesnt have hope, instead the plot takes you into an area that is dark, sorrowful, and depressing with some bigotry on the side. It is by far the worst Xmas time movie I have ever seen. I call it an xmas movie because they promoted as such, and it came out during the holidays. Definitely avoid this one, unless you feel like being pushed over the edge and out a window."
1,EXTREMELY IMPLAUSIBLE,"There's NO WAY this could happen in real life. Now, I know we go to the movies to escape, but the ending of this movie is so ridiculous that it's completely implausible.SPOILER ALERT!!!!Who on earth would get engaged to someone they spent one night talking to??? (Everett & Julie)That was unbelievably ridiculous.That ended it for me...I thought the movie was stupid."
1,Total waste of time,"Wow, what a bad movie. The plot goes in fifty different directions leading to a just plain bad movie. If they had picked one of the ideas and ran with it then it might have been ok. The story is totally unbelievable, its like they tried to fit everything that is considered dysfunctional into one family. Please save your money for a better movie."
2,Deceiving Trailer,"Family Stone is similar to Rumor Has It, great cast and potentially great story line, tagged as a romantic comedy. But in actuality Family Stone just like Rumor Has It, is just a melodrama with a side of comedy. It's two somber and depressing for me I expected light, funny, good feel movie, what I got was a downer, depressing, mother dying film that ended not making you feel great but all sad cause the mom dies. They need to start advertising these movies for what they are melodramas with actors that usually play comic roles. The movie is boring, long, and drawn out don't wasted your time."
4,What a Movie,"Although marketed to be another awkward comedy like what poor Ben Stiller had to face in Meet the Parents, The Family Stone is anything, but simply eccentric. Yes, the fiance is uptight, grating and at times humorless, but this movie is far less about uncomfortable comedy than about uncomfortable reality. In truth, its an intense drama about life, love, growing up, growing old and facing death with only your family(as dysfunctional as everyone's are)to hold it all back with you. Superb performances from the unconventional cast and Diane Keaton's character is especially nuanced and heart-breaking in her depth and courage."
4,Funny and heartbreaking all at once.,"I live in this family so it was very hard to watch at times. Covers very well some very difficult subjects like gay marriage, race and parenthood, and bi-racial couples, as well as cancer, come to think of it, it covers all the really hard subjects in one very well made movie!!"
4,Warning - This movie is sad!,"I like sweet, no-thought-required movies. This one is great, but I took off a star because it made me cry! The part where the mom with cancer is lying in bed next to her husband and she puts his hand on her chest...... wahhhhhhhhhhIt's a very cute movie, and great for a group of girls who dream about finding love in peculiar places."
4,The Family Stone,"Movie arrived quickly, only one problem though. When watching movie it skipped a section of the movie, it had a small scratch. I contacted the seller, they sent a return envelope which included postage (no cost to me). After they received the DVD they sent out a new DVD and it was perfect. Service was very good although it took a little while. I was happy with the service and would purchase from them again."
1,If Only I could GIve Zero Stars,"Oh the Family Stone....This movie was marketed as a comedy. This movie may have a few funny moments...but for the most part is a family drama. I was expecting laughs, not tears of sadness. I also bought this to watch this expecting it to be funny, not about cancer and death...which was upsetting to some other viewers in my household. About the other themes within the movie, some of the political correctness of the characters was soooooo over the top....and most of the time I was pitying Parker's character and cheering for when the mother and nasty sister would be seriously hurt. I almost cheered at the end of the movie, no wait I did for two reasons, the mean mother was gone and the movie was finally over and I could return it immediately to the video store!! Wish I could get my money back!"
2,I Already Forgot What It Was About.......,"Was this the one with Jennifer Aniston or Sara Jessica Parker? Oh yeah, now I remember. The funniest scene in the movie was when the entire Stone Family was shocked, yes shocked, that Sara Jessica Parker questioned whether the gay deaf brother and his lover should maybe think about the child first before considering adopting a baby together. The only normal person in this movie was SJP, even though she was made out to be the freak. Oh well, that's Hollyweird for you."
1,Press for America's moral decay,"How can one feel anything but sick inside when the realization comes that this movie states very clearly where we are as a nation with respect to family and morality. We think we're getting better as a people by being accepting of what should be unacceptable, but the truth is that the more we embrace ""anything goes"" we lose our ability to function responsibly. We willingly sacrifice the possibility for a future in exchange for our temporary pleasures. It hasn't worked for any previous society and it doesn't and will not work for any of us. This movie is an example of Hollywood advertising FAIL as acceptable. I came from FAIL and don't care to see it portrayed in a good light. Some have commented that they think the movie is ""real"". They're absolutely correct, and that's my point. I wish it wasn't so."
1,Family Stone presents a wrong message to family systems,The movie Family Stone present a wrong message to family systems.The union of a man and a woman in marriage is the center of a real family and contributes to life reproduction. Presents false information about homosexuality.
3,Predictable From Beginning To End,"If you had watched the commercials for this movie you might have been expecting an entertaining family style movie. But instead you get a movie filled with bad dialogue, bad acting and a bad storyline. Meet the dysfunctional family where women fall in love with their sister's fiancés and men fall in love with their brother's fiancé, the grandmother curses in front of everyone and children call their parents by their first names.Sarah Jessica Parker meets her boyfriend's parents over Christmas. They don't like her - why? We don't know. Why does Sarah Jessica Parker act so rude from beginning to end. There is no chemistry between anyone and why is Rachel McAdams wearing these ugly clothes that make her look fat. Why does the Stone family fawn over Sarah Jessica Parker's sister?This movie is ok to watch once but it isn't exactly a story or family you will care much about."
4,"Drama, not a comedy, but a good family drama!","I think that the largest misconception about this movie has been that it would be a comedy, that every scene would be funny, witty, or action packed. While there are numerous very funny moments, THE FAMILY STONE is much more of a thoughtful family drama.THE FAMILY STONE is about a loving, intelligent, emotional family, and their reluctance in permitting the oldest son to give the coveted family diamond ring -- The FAMILY Stone -- to the annoying, uptight, judgmental nutcase who he wishes to marry. The family's response to his chosen bride is emotional and understandable. The merits or originality of the plot andf writing aside, I was impressed and I enjoyed the characters and the plot.I am glad I didn't let other reviews dissuade me from renting THE FAMILY STONE. I though that Meredith Morton, the crazy bride to be played by Sarah Jessica Parker, was very interesting and complex, and even when she was being an uptiight judgmental witch, I felt for her."
4,really good movie,"This movie combines real life relationships and drama with laughter, lessonsand renewal. Wonderful cast. Set at Christmas time is always a plus for me."
3,Cute and sweet,This is a simple brainless chick flick with good looking people and Hollywood sweethearts. For low expectations is good enough.
5,A Christmas Love Story to be Remembered,"The Family Stone is a touching film about love, families, and connections all in the fore-front of a white Christmas back east in the USA. The cast is a marvelous group of actors who may surprise you with their performances because they are gifted, subtle, funny without trying, and tender. Snuggle up for a great movie year after year!"
4,Good Christmas Movie,"This is one of my girlfriend's favorite movies to watch at christmas, because it reminds her of her large family. There are some sad themes to the movie, but overall, it is a great movie."
2,I don't like anyone in this movie...,"....so I think I will watch the ending now and skip the middle hour. Too bad. From the commercials I thought it would be pretty funny--all it is is mean people acting up. Yeech. With that cast, I had high hopes.OK...watched the ending. Nothing in it that made me very curious regarding the path to it.Life is short--skip this one."
4,Good,A dysfunctional family it is but very heartwarming to see how a family comes together...funny and entertaining; even my husband enjoyed this one.
2,"A dreary holiday film, not rescued by a good cast","If you're looking for a fun holiday film, then you'll want to skip this one. In spite of a good cast, the film falls flat, primarily due to the fact the 'quirky' Stone family come across as mean spirited and self-absorbed with no empathy (or even courtesy) for anyone else. There's little chemistry between the characters and for the most part it looks like everyone is just biding their time until this unrewarding mess of a film fades to black. Your time will be better spent watching 'A Chrismas Story' for the hundredth time (or just about any of the holiday staples)."
4,"Good Cast, Good film","Sarah Jessica Parker, who was nominated for a Golden Globe for her superb performance as an uptight businesswoman that everyone hates, heads a fine emsemble cast in excellent Holiday drama that has some good laughs as well. A New England family, dealing with their own mortality while spending their last Christmas together with their beloved mother, have a lot of issues to resolve. The fact that the mother is terminally ill doesn't weigh the picture down. Much of the focus is on the relationships of the sons and their women and the importance of choosing the right path for love and for personal freedom. Good film."
2,"same ingredients, same taste with different dish titles","endless family gatherings stories, either this or that, outsiders, rich or poor family background, try to mingle into the clan, difficulties, personal problems, family gossips, throw in some cancer patients, gay and lesbian fmaily members, all the same ingredients cooked together, come out with the same taste but in different titles on the menu at different prices. in addition to african americans played as women in the black comedies, what else is new and what else you guys in hollywood could show me with some really serious creations? are we not having enough yet? give it a rest, okay? and one more thing, i could not agree more with some other viewers that diane keaton should retire and refrain from signing up any new movie again."
1,Nauseating,"Not that original, not very funny, transparent acting. You might rent it, but I wouldn't recommend buying it cause I don't see how one could watch it more than once. :-P"
1,Liberals Beware,"If you believe in any tenets of liberalism, DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM. It must have been written by a conservative because every liberal person in the plot is portrayed as close-minded, self-indulgent, intolerant, and narcissistic. The only character willing to discuss topics openly and work hard to be accepted by the other characters is a conservative woman. Also, every liberal in the story comes off as being uneducated. None of them are able to defend, yet alone discuss, their beliefs. Whenever they are challenged, they can only respond with irritation, disdain, shouting, and violence. Definitely not a movie for the holidays, though it is described as one."
1,Dysfunctional isn't the same as interesting,"I have to admit, it took me several days to watch this all the way through. Fish out of water Sarah Jessica Parker meets her fiance's family over Christmas. She's pathetic and dull, and the family is snide, nasty and dull. After half an hour or so of waiting for something interesting to happen, or not even something interesting but *something*, and hoping Sarah Jessica would bail on these nasty losers & end the film, I wondered who thought this movie was a good idea? It's like watching a train wreck in v e r y s l o w m o t i o n. My advice: wait for the Lifetime Cable version and watch the commercials instead."
3,The sure-fire movie kit,"Satisfaction guaranteed. Please check contents before proceeding: 1 busy airport; 1 holiday gift shop; 1 rural setting; 1 candlelit inn; 2 Christmases; 1 snowstorm; 1 empty football stadium; 3 brownies; 1 witchy mother-in-law; 1 befuddled father; 2 jealous sisters; 2 jealous brothers; 1 cell phone obsession; 1 good-natured slob; 1 hearing-impaired homosexual; exactly 1 grown-up African-American; exactly 1 little girl; 1 expectant mother; 1 expectant mother heirloom photograph; 2 babies (1 white, 1 black); 2 firemen (1 carrying presents); 1 bus stop surprise; 1 bus stop goodbye; innumerable reunions; 1 breakfast-on-the-floor (You saw this in the previews, leading you to believe this was a comedy.); 1 drinking binge; 1-1/2 bed scenes; 1 Judy Garland song tying together a sentimental montage. You must supply your own handkerchief. (No matter how cynical you think you are, you're going to need it)."
4,"Funny, poignant","This really is a fun, insightful and evocative movie. It has a great ensemble cast that includes a few new up and comers. This movie isn't a pure romantic comedy, and is certainly not a pure drama/tragedy but a mix of the two with more of the former than that latter. I really do recommend it to anyone."
1,Don't waste your money.,"This is by far one of the worst movies I've seen in years. I'm with the guy who said if you paid a dollar to see it you paid too much, about 98 cent too much.I expected so much more from the stars in this flop and I'm very surprised anyone would play these roles."
2,what kinda BS is this?,"man wants to marry woman and so brings her home to meet his parents and siblings. then he meets the woman's sister, falls in love with her and tells the woman he doesn't want to marry her anymore! and the woman inturn has falled in love with the man's bro and so doesn't want to marry him too!c'mon ...and the stunning rachel mcadams is wasted here as a bitchy sister ..."
1,Want to Feel Uncomfortable for Two Hours?,"We are big Sarah Jessica Parker fans, so we came into this movie with an open mind and expected to be entertained. Instead, we were treated to a couple of hours of feeling bad for Sarah's character as her soon-to-be-fiance and his family mistreat her for no apparent reason. Without giving away any more plot - I'd ask any potential buyer to SHUN this movie, especially if they are Parker fans. You'll just be uncomfortable for two hours and mad for another two at the end of it all."
1,Bad storyline,"This family is like your mean relatives, you just can't wait for them to leave. The mom is just opinionated & know it all & when she dies you don't really feel bad for them. The rest of the story is like watching a blender, mix a smoothy, you see it spinning, know something is happening, you catch a glimpse, but you don't know what is in it. I'm just glad I did not pay admission price at the theater to watch this."
4,MORE SAD THAN COMEDY,"This movie was such a good movie. But from the preveiws, it looked like it was a comedy. But when I saw it, it was actually more of a drama.It was about a man and a womanwho are engaged to be married. But the woman has to meet his family. When they get there, the family doesn't give Sarah Jessica Parker(girlfriend)an exact warm welcome. They are actually really mean to her. And alot of stuff happens besides that. The brother likes her. The sister doesn't. The mother is hiding a secret from her family which causes chaos. The father doesn't know what to do. And she just feels really unwelcome. Now I'm not going to ruin the movie for you and tell you what makes the movie sad. but this movie isn't really a comedy either. It's more drama. I do recommend it to anyone who likes a sad, but great film. Yup, this was a real tear-jerker."
5,Love It!,"I really do love this movie! I had to buy it since I watched it several times. I love the characters, they seem so genuine."
4,The Family Stone,"This is one of my favorite Christmas movies. It is not the usual sweetness and light holiday fare. It is about a real family. Funny is places, and sad in places. I would recomend to my daughters and many friends."
3,Like the film but not the commentary,"So, I like the film. I do. A little bit of drama and comedy doesn't do anybody any harm if it's done well. I really expected so much more but Dermot Mulroney and Sarah Jessica Parker are responsible for the worst commentary I think I've seen. They are quiet a lot of the time, just watching the film and what good is that as we all know that the volume of the film's turned down on the commentary. She giggles a lot which gets annoying after a while, but there's no real insight into the film. Disappointing."
1,Excruciating,"Politically correct, cliche-ridden claptrap. I'm surprised they didn't have a Muslim housekeeper in a burka-For such an enlightened group, their intolerance was their most outstanding characteristic."
1,"Watch ""Love Actually"" instead.","I watched this movie having no great expectation. It did have two thumbs up, and I find that I usually enjoy movies with that rating. What I found instead was a poorly crafted example of a politically correct agenda. Five minuets into the movie I hated the entire family. For example at dinner, when Sara Jessica Parker expresses naive opinions about gays she is immediately shut down. Whatever happened to discussion, debate, or even a good healthy argument? What ever happened to manners? Everyone in this movie is judgmental and one-dimensional. Additionally, this movie isn't funny and the laughs that it does provide are too few for the price of wasting your time sitting through this rubbish. A much better ensemble cast movie with lots of heart, laughs, and a better message would be ""Love Actually""."
5,Great Movie!,"The Family Stone (Widescreen Edition)How could this movie miss? It has a great cast, a storyline that's both poignant and hilarious at the same time. The characters are diverse, but never fall into the trap of becoming cardboard or stale. I could watch this movie over and over and not get bored."
1,A really bad movie...,"Bad script, bad characters, bad movie. The characters made no sense, the plot made no sense. Great cast, but what a waste of talents. Can't belive they said yes to this movie... Don't buy or watch this movie, it's not worth your time or money. I'm not even going to write about why this movie is bad because it's not worth it. I just wanted to warn you people who is thinking of buying this..."
3,Blue State Christmas,"Ah ... Christmas in New England.... where diversity is celebrated ... sort of. This family gathering movie has a couple of token minorities (who have about 8 lines between them), a controlling mom, wise yet passive dad and a bevy of beautiful adult kids. One of them dares to bring home a person with a job (read: republican, played nicely by Sarah Jessica Parker) and the family trashes her in cruel but amusing ways. The high powered cast is great fun to watch, with Rachel McAdams in a small but enchanting part as the meanest of the crew, Diane Keaton as the doomed, overprotective mom, and Craig Nelson as the professor father who manages to maintain a New England estate. Well done, dude.All that sniping aside... this is still a good Christmas movie. You can call the ending 30 minutes into the movie but it doesn't matter -- everyone still has a nice Christmas and so will you."
3,The Family Stone DVD,"Better than I expected, but I was left still wanting something more from the movie, from the plot, from the cast.The actors were excellent, each role cast well. Claire Danes, Diane Keaton, Craig T. Nelson, Dermot Mulroney and Luke Wilson all were easy to fall for. Sarah Jessica Parker's character was easy to pity and feel sorry for. (Meredith Morton could really put her foot in her mouth).The ending was visible after a brief period, but, overall the movie was an enjoyable way to spend an evening."
3,Could have been FUNNIER,"Gimme that screenplay, I could have made it a lot more funnier, and i hate when they try to mix drama within a comedy movie. Diane Keaton gave a very good but predictable performance. Sarah Jessica Parker too bad they cancelled Sex and the City have not seen you in anything worth watching since. Not a typical holiday flick."
2,Family Stone,Where else except in a movie is a girlfriend going to go out with her boyfriends brother and the boyfriend falls in love with her sister...I can't believe he had actually purchased an engagement ring and ended up marrying the sister and the girlfriend married the brother! Where are the morals?
4,Really funny and entertaining,"After initially watching the menu page on the DVD, I was like, aw jeez. This looks rather tranquil (you'll see what I mean). Heck no, this movie will throw you for a loop! It's anything but tranquil! Sara Jessica Parker did a wonderful job in this, and Rachel McAdams was funny as the mean sister. If you want to laugh, watch it, it's really good."
3,Borderline Schlock,"""The Family Stone"" is supposedly a Christmas movie, but Christmas is just a ruse for this nightmare of a family gathering. They have about as much Holiday spirit as a cockfight. Rather, they are irritatingly petty and judgmental people, sort of like the ones we all knew in junior high school.After a series of cringe-inducing scenes, two of the characters head for a bar. By this time, I needed a drink as much as they did. Then shortly thereafter, the movie tries to redeem itself by becoming a ""Moonstruck"" wannabe; however, it fails miserably. I won't elaborate; enough has been said by other reviewers already. I'll just take a middle-of-the-road approach and give the movie three stars, because I am more charitable than the characters in it. But if you're the kind of viewer who seeks something more edifying than a run-of-the-mill dopey Hollywood flick, bypass this one."
4,Loved this Movie,"If your from a big family and get together for Holidays, birthdays etc and have ever had someone new introduced into your already quirky family you'll love this movie! It reminded me so much of my own family with girlfriends, boyfriends, husbands and wives being brought home to meet the family for the first time. And the family absolutely can not stand this person but the family member thinks they are in love with them. I think the casting for this movie was excellent. I'm a fan of Craig T Nelson, Sarah Jessica Parker, Diane Keaton and now the rest of the cast. I laughed, I cried and a couple times thought to myself WHY DIDN'T I WRITE THIS SCRIPT?"
4,I liked it,"My father died 8 months ago, and if you have experienced the loss of a parent, you can empathize with the chaos it throws the family into. Once you understand that Sybil is dying, it all clicks in together, and actually the plot twists and developments did not seem that unbelievable. My sister and I watched this together and could identify with the way a family goes into shock over a tragic loss and everyone can really act out. The two things that seemed too out of whack were Amy's acidity - no one would be THAT mean - and Meredith's ""gays are not 'normal'"" disaster at the dinner table.Other than that, we found it touching."
5,Touching movie,"I really enjoyed THE FAMILY STONE. I was expecting it to be a comedy, and I definately did laugh, but it was also very poignant and touching. It revolves around the Stone family, and when one of their sons brings home a girlfriend that no one likes or gets along with. An excellent cast of strong players including Craig T Nelson, Diane Keaton, Luke Wilson, Dermot Mulroney, Sarah Jessica Parker, Claire Danes, Rachel McAdams, and many more. I thought it was a really touching movie, and a nice family movie for the holidays. Who doesn't have a dysfunctional family? This was a great movie and I can't wait to pick up the DVD when it's out."
4,A decent family drama,"Family Stone is kind of an odd movie. It's a drama about a messed up family, but it's actually pretty funny and entertaining. It has just enough drama and heartache to feel real, but enough comedy to make it fun and uplifting. It's definitely a good movie to watch if you're stressed out by your own family gatherings over Christmas. It shows that things could always get worse."
2,too many issues,"As a Christian, I have to rate this movie low. The homosexuality (as all new movies seem to have these days) is too blatant and in your face, and when a character tries to discuss it, gets the usual knee jerk homophobic reaction from the pro homosexuality camp. With that said, it is funny, moving, well acted, a good plot and well casted. I just don't like paying for an entertainment venue and having a subject which I find very offensive shoved in my face as much as this movie did."
1,Hollywood what trash i want my life back.,"i can't believe anyone thought this movie was funny, in a nutshell this movie is a mean, cruel sprited. i get the family is dyfunctional but even in dyfunctional family they have a little heart and try to expect the new outsider. this being the girlfriend played by (sarah jessica parker.) the brother 's queer friend gets a more warm handshake which is totally stupid. i thought was going to scream and wished i never would've rent this turkey. the only good parts in this film are the last 15 minutes."
1,Trash,"Abosulte rubbish!! (I wouldn't even give this film a 1 star)And obvious.Apart from Sarah (Meredith), Luke (Ben) and Rachel (Amy), all the other actors were just awful, Dermot especially. So bad i almost cried. Diane Keating was painful to watch, as was Claire Danes - she can't act - her character was expressionless and wooden. Plus she is ugly.Why oh why did i go and see it?What more can i say?Save your money; don't go and see it!"
1,Not a Family Affair to remember,"when I heard the Family Stone I start thinking Sly&the Family Stone,but not this Corny dime a dozen cliche film that basically resembles any Tv show that profits off Dysfunctinal. this film never gets off the ground for the simple fact it can't make up it's mind if it wants to be a Comedy or a Drama.unlike Sly&the Family Stone this Film never takes you Higher."
4,Da young kidz like me doin thier thang!.!.!.!,"I luv me sume Bow Wow, Sammie, Lil J, and Lil Johnny, but wen i heard Corey song I jus had to bump it and put dem otha people to tha side fo a while. Tha beat iz bangin and even though most of my friendz be hatin on him I still give him hiz propz. Tha otha songz on hiz single iz kinda hot too. . . . .HoLlA"
1,"Bad, very bad film",If this is Indy film making - you can have it. GoreGoyles: Mutant Edition - is nothing but trash. The acting was very poor. I'm sorry - there is nothing to say - other than don't wast the two hours it will take to get through this - it is BAD!!!!I am so glad I saw this on netflix and did not waste a nickle on this film - these people should be put in prison for corrupting the art of film making - the sound track - was horrible - you could see the boom and mic in some of the shots. What as waste of time. None of these people will ever get a real acting job - they are just that bad!!!!!!Larry - horror fan. The old time B horror movies are so much better than this junk. P.S. this film gets one star because I can not give it none-yes NONE - it is truly that bad!!!!
4,Tru dawgs,"When I bought this album by C-Murder, I didnt expect this to be a compilation album. He only is on a few tracks. On the first single ""I'm a baller"" featuring Mac and T-Bo is a sure rider hit you can blast in the streets on a summer day. This or that is good but 2 of his tracks stand out. What's the Reason he speaks with his inner self on why he should go on with life. Betya which is far one of his best songs to date takes shots at some rappers such as Juvenile and Mystikal. Other artists are on this album as well. Keith Murray is a surprise with his single ""Just Like That"" and Mia X makes a appearance on ""They wanna"" with a Sugar Hill Gang intro beat which is solid. I hope this is not the last album by C-Murder. One of the realest rappers from the Dirty South"
3,A Compilation,"Firts I thought C-Murder was on all of da tracks but he's only on 5. 4 of 5 are tight,some of the other songs are good too,but its not a C-Murder CD.I'ma TRU Big No Limit Fan but I give dis CD 3 stars.but its good. check out 'Betya' C disses Juvenile,Mystikal and Cash Money. FREE C-MURDER .HE'S INNOCENT"
1,A poorly constructed adapter.,"This is one of the worst products I have ever purchased. In addition, it can't be returned if you open it to try it. It is intermittent and one side of the cable doesn't work. I would not waste money on this product. I also won't purchase from this company again."
1,Don't Do IT!!!!,"This movie made no sense what so ever? and what plot there was to begin with was lost in the layers they had? The sex scenes were ummmmm horrible, they weren't even sex scenes it was make out scenes with the ocassional shirt off. I would say save your $$$$, It was realllyyyyyy horrible."
3,Stories of stories 3,"Accomplishing the ""twenty spine chilling tales"", an Australian-produced five-DVD set presents, according to producers, a cream de la cream of the Dahl's stories-tragic, deceptive, ambiguous events depicted by a strongly hilarious way.It is good for watching in-between something more educative and mind-broadening."
1,Spatula use,The spatula looks very good but if you are trying to flip fried eggs or anything of any weight the spatula bends and drops the object. It really is of no use to me for my cooking!
4,Its a good toilet seat - nice look and good quality - hinge is a little wobbly,It arrived on time - well packaged. Good quality except the hinge is machined a little loose. Installation was extremely easy. It looks good and for the price is worth it for a classy wood seat.
1,Defective Workmanship,"We received the shipment promptly but upon trying to install it, discovered that one side's hardware had not been machined properly and was useless. We returned the defective unit for a credit and purchased a Bemis seat from a local store. It was disappointing to see that the paint finish was blemished in multiple places. I know, its just a toilet seat, but hey if they can't make toilet seats right these days, we're in big trouble."
4,I like this so much I could just . . .,I've used many toilet seats in my time and this is certainly one of them.
2,Disappointing,"I would skip this unengaging work and head to others by the author (Bend in the River, etc) unless completeness is your goal. The prose was uninspired and I found myself rushing to finish. A completely different work is the beautifully written and truly comic novel, Suffrage of Elvira."
3,Typical Naipaul,"This is another typical naipaullian work, full of stereotypes. Associating so called ""lower castes"" with lack of beauty...what a joke. Only an english major can come with such simple way of looking at the world. There is a lot of inequality in the world, but beauty and brain were not unequally distributed in the world by God. There are lot of ugly Brahmins in the world and lots of absolutely beautiful so called ""low caste"" women. Naipaul tries to be outrageous in his writings which is understandable given that he wants to be popular through his writings. It can be seen in his views of India too.On a positive note his comments about Kama Sutra seemed correct to me. His suggestion for Indian men also seem on the mark. Overall not a bad read."
2,A Half Novel,"I am a great Naipaul fan. I have been, ever since I read A House for Mr Biswas. But Half a Life was disappointing. It doesn't hold together well, the ending is abrupt and I didn't get the point. Very disappointing."
4,"Well Done, Just Not Memorable","V.S. Naipaul is one of those writers with tremendous talent, so much so that even not his best work is still very well done. He writes so much better than most writers, but the problem with Half a Life is that it really is not a very good showcase of his talents; it's not one of those books which I will remember months from now as being wonderful. The messages won't linger for more than a few weeks. I still think this is a well done work, compared to much of what else is available, it's just that coming from Naipaul, I found it a bit disappointing."
4,Family,"This is an endless source of material. How much can one extract oneself from the family that brought you into this world, or is it a repeating cycle?"
1,Boring Life,"I'd heard Naipaul was such a great author I tried slogging through this novel. What a bore! The prose is stilted, he wanders aimlessly telling stories about minor characters we don't care about. I finally threw it against the wall. Give me something that makes me Feel!"
1,"Captivating, but ended without making too much of a point ...","I am an Indian. Indians seem to be proud of Mr. Naipaul as he is of ""Indian Origin"". This is the first book I read of his. Earlier, I had read about him sometimes on the web. And the image I had of him was that he was somewhat of a bitter man.While reading this book, this image of his seemed to be reinforced. He does not seem to be able to see too much good in others. Though he has a sharp eye for seeing the quirkinesses.The book was captivating. I do not know the reason for this though. Maybe it is because he is a good author. Maybe I am captivated too easily. There did not seem to be too much in the book. And it finished all of a sudden. As if the author got bored of writing and so decided to stop.Reading some of the other reviews, it seems his other works are better. I surely will try to read some other book of his some time.But my suggestion would be to skip reading this one."
2,get a life and pass on half a life.,"I expected this book to be much better written. The author dwells on the obvious. The struggle for the protagonist to grow beyond his very limited background is only touched upon in a limited way. The writing is not intelligent or clever. The characters are flat. The historical background is superficial and leaves the reader wanting to know more about the historical setting and timeline. At best, this should have been a short story."
4,Very good Naipaul,Naipaul is my favourite author and I have almost all his books. His descriptions of his experiences in London and Africa are always excellent and this is no exception. I particularly liked the part of the book set in London in 50s and his description of the way of life for all immigrants regardless of where they were from. The book ends in Mozambique and the story of the end of empire is poignant.
3,Haphazard summary of a life,"I found this book to be worth reading and enjoyed its author's ability to translate emotional struggles that are cultural in nature to an audience not familiar with the culture in question. Still, as a novel, it didn't quite hold together for me, more for reasons of plot, emphasis and temporality than for reasons of prose."
2,Not what I expected,"I found this book to be quite a dissappointment. This is the only Naipaul work I have read and can only assume that his previous offerings must have been far superior in light of his recent Nobel prize award. This is definitely not a page turner. I forced myself through this book hoping it would develope and get better, but it didn't. I found myself disliking the main character to the point of simply not wanting to read about him any more. If this book is indicative of Mr. Naipaul's prize winning qualities I should perhaps conclude that I am not intellectually savy enough to appreciate his style. I did not enjoy this book and would be curious as to why this would appeal to anyone. Cheers!"
4,When does the half become a smaller fraction?,"Perhaps Willie, the antihero, felt that he was leading half a life because his life in Mozambique was Ana's and not his. Before lamenting the tragedy, however, consider what might happen when you add a few kids and a load of nagging relatives into this equation. Then someone's life could easily turn into an infinitessimal fraction of a life. Better half than nothing at all! Besides, it's a quick and entertaining read. With the right attitude, this novel can even make you feel good."
2,Big problem,I like the watch and it works well but I can't use it because the plastic band broke after I had it just a few days and I don't know how to replace it.
5,Great Music,"I was introduced to the T-Birds in the early 80's while hitting the Greenville Bars in Dallas TX. I saw them perform, bought the album and have been a fan since. Thank you Amazon, it in now again part of my collection."
3,Wake Up AMAZON!!!,What does the product description have to do with this T-Birds album? Maybe product reviews are being outsourced to Mexico these days. There's no excuse for this sloppiness.
1,Wrong product sent.,"i ordered the 20 pin to 3.5mm adapter, and the sent me some cheap looking headphones for a phone. Talk about bad business, don't buy from this person."
4,Screwball comedy,"This is pretty decent as a guilty pleasure. Not very good on the level of a bad movie you can sit around and laugh with your friends. The kind of movie you can pop a boner to and laugh at the same time. A rare breed indeed. Also, there's a porn floating around with the chick from this movie. I suggest not watching that porn as it degrades subsequent viewings of this movie tremendously. I'll never watch this again."
2,Bar brawl babe?,"I just saw this for the first time. Funny how people think this is better than the first. As far as the ladies go, my favorite by far is the topless dancer that is the main focal point during the bar brawl scene. Any idea who she is?"
1,It's so bad it must be seen.,"I have seen some bad movies in my time but this takes the cake as the worst. The one-liners in this movie are so corny you bust out laughing. You have to see the sets , cardboard walls and backgrounds that have visble camera lights....This is horrible...but in a funny way"
5,Back! By popular demand! :),"This is a great ""B"" movie. I rated it a 5, which i don't ever hand out to ""B"" movies, but as far as they go, this is one of the greatest. Obviously it can't compare with greats like BraveHeart and such, but you have to know what you're getting into before watching this.I believe there are 4 Death Stalker movies. 1 and 4 try to be ""serious"", kind of like Conan rip-offs.... not real great. 2 and 3 go the more ""humorous"" route, with 3 failing pretty badly.But Death Stalker 2 is GREAT! Adventure, comedy, action, slashing, and for those that like beautiful women in their movies, Monique Gabrielle doesn't disappoint!Be ready for a cheesy movie, but it's fun cheesy! Lots of great (and bad) one-liners throughout. :)"
5,"great stuff, name brand matters","I have hypertension. After reading good things about coq10, I thought I would try it. It not only gave me more energy and helped me feel better. I also enhanced my mood. When I saw another brand that is usually more expensive on sale I tried it but found onlyNature's Bounty Co Q-10, 400 mg, 30 SoftgelsNatures Bounty brand worked for me. I am sticking with this. My mood is better and my energy is much better. I am walking more and enjoying my family more. I highly recommend this product."
4,Good Supplement,This is a reorder. I have been using this for over a year and feel it works well for me
4,A wonderful comprehensive guide to computer 2D & 3D,"This book is great. I have authored a few 3D engines in my day (Dave's 3D Engine for instance), and this book has been a lifesaver. It is not only a great introductory text on the principles of 2D and 3D graphics (complex and simple), but it is an invaluable reference book. It's chapters have succint coverage of just about every major facet of 3D: transformations, shading, everything. It also has some chapters on some of the more arcane stuff too - which is a great read once you springboard off the introductory stuff. Four stars."
1,Horrible,"This is a travesty, especially when one has read the wonderful novel and seen the classic film. The play does not do justice to either. I picked this up with the intention of redacting it for a radio version, and there is nothing to use, as we wanted to be true to the film, using this. But alas, this goes so far away from both book and film I am going to use it for a coaster. I wish I could have given it zero stars.A Hell of A Relationship: A Tale of Love and Penance (Volume 1)"
5,Best skin tonic,"I was amazed how quickly I got relief on a burn when I used Aloe Vera, almost like magic. I find it very good for giving my dry itchy skin."
5,Excellent battlefield guide,"This guide covers all of the 384 principle battles of the Civil War, with maps of certain battles and casualty statistics at the end of each essay. Information is also given on the current statis of the battlefields. A must reference guide for your Civil War library."
5,civil war - used,A very well taken care of edition of Civil War Battlefields.Why buy new when books of this quality are available ?
3,Thoughtful but overdone and confusing,"This book is designed to give those who wish to tour Civil War battlefield sites insight of the sites. Although this is a good idea it tends to confuse you more then inform you. This book is written in a manner that does not help historians or vacationers. I would recommend though donationg to the conservation fund, but if you are planning to tour the sites there are better books out there for you."
3,"Excellent Synopsis, Excellent Maps","While the work certainly carries the battle summaries of very well known Civil War historians and has wonderful maps, by trying to tackle 55 different battles, it tends to stop short of a full understanding of the war, and completely ignores the other family members who could care less about the trenches while on vacation."
4,awesome...,"'skin against skin' has gotta be the freshest acid jazz song of all time! ive never heard anything that was that intense!!! and deborah andersons lyrics are amazing as well! of course the album consists of other great songs, but im just riding this song for now!!"
4,good,"this is a good cd!!i was thinkin that it would have more instrumentals then songs with differents artist singing on it, it has 28 tracks on it, and i say that 20 out of the 28 are good, becuz there are alot of things that should not have been in there, but overall it is a very good cd!!!"
5,awesome,"This is another untouchable album from Krush. This time he has a lot more rapping. However, the beats are still the best part of the album. Throughout the record he succeeds in creating a thoroughly apocalyptic atmosphere, with most of his guests getting prophetic about the future. There seems to be an abundance of collaborations on here, the best being the Mos Def and DJ Cam tracks. But, all in all, Krush is still dropping his own unique style of raw hip-hop inyour face. Sure to be a classic."
5,Simply Great,"I have extremely enjoyed the beats, the MC, the DJ work, and the feeling that DJ Krush has to offer in Milight. Simply, an excellent piece of work."
5,XBOX 360 Toxic Faceplate Skin,"The skin itself looks great. It goes and comes off very easily. It just takes some time to get the skin on perfect, but don't worry if you mess up you can just take it off and re-adjust it. I also recommend getting the whole set for the whole 360 because it looks kind of awkward with just the white plastic on the sides. Also see my Customer Pictures."
5,Brilliant and Bittersweet,"This is the second of Adriana Trigiani's novels that I have read. I did not think I could love another story as much as I loved Trigiani's ""Very Valentine"" but I do.The story captivates as Aunt Lu, the beloved and only daughter of the Sartori family, tells the story of her life to Kit, a neighbor in her apartment on Commerce Street in Greenwich Village.This story is about lost loves and the paths we take in our lives that change the plans that we have made for ourselves. The story touched me deeply because I was able to look at my own life and relate to Lucia's story. This is a real keeper and not to be missed."
4,Like Chocolate for the Mind,"This story was told with such finesse and elegance, the description were just as appealing as the plot. Trigiani is a dedicated writer and historian- this book truly came alive.This was the first Trigiani book I read and I was enthralled. I picked up ""Big Stone Gap"" a week later and never bothered to finish it..."
4,"Different from ""Big Stone Gap"" series....but very good !!!!","""Lucia Lucia"" was a total diversion from the ""Big Stone Gap"" series...but i found it to be very good reading. It revolves around the lives of an Italian family in New York in the 1950s and i found it to be very enticing and easy to read...once i started, i couldn't put it down!!!!! While I would love to see another Ave Maria installation...i give Adriana a thumbs-up for this novel!!!!!"
2,Not much better than Danielle Steele,"This book was very predictable and written with a thud, as a previous reviewer stated. For instance: ""As much as I love my brothers, I've never been able to tell them things that I could have told a sister. Mama was senstitive to that and tried to compensate. But some things I would have felt more comfortable saying to a sister instead of Mama."" This, to me, is not interesting writing. The plot is not much better than a Danielle Steele formula book. Disappointing."
2,Thud,"Lucia, Lucia is nowhere near as good as Trigiani's Big Stone Gap series. This story is predictable and dry. The events happen with a thud instead of a delicate ""unfolding."" I found it depressing and unbelievable that characters severed or maintained relationships when their good sense should have told them not to. I felt no sympathy for Lucia. She made bad choices.I might have enjoyed the book more if I had read it myself instead of listening to it on CD. Mira Sorvino's reading was uneven, and her New York Italian accent showed up irregularly."
3,"Cliched and predictable, but entertaining","I read this book because I heard the author interviewed on NPR, and she seemed bright and interesting, albeit slightly bossy. And I wasn't entirely disappointed. The writing is artless, but competent and readable. The characters are predictable and cliched, but sympathetic. The plot is formulaic and hackneyed, but interesting. This was an utterly enjoyable, mostly harmless beach read, and I recommend it as such."
2,Um...huh?,"Not good, folks, sorry. There are many better books to spend your money on in hardcover that aren't as pulpy as this one. I recommend instead buying The Dogs of Babel, The Pursuit of Alice Thrift or The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime, all three far superior to this one and worth the money. You should wait for the paperback for this one. I wouldn't have felt so angry at the low quality if I'd spent less of my hard-earned cash on it, you know?"
1,Like cheap chocolate: ok but not worth the calories,"Don't know what book the other reviewers read...the ""characters"" are more like ""caricatures"". We can fully describe each character in a single sentence. The plot is not only linear but predictable. Yes, it's a ""light read"" but I want more entertainment in a ""light"" reading, more ""heat"" if it is supposed to be a romance novel (which I wouldn't read anyway), or more thought-provocation in a book that addresses an ethnic, career woman's life in the 1950s. This book is none of the above. After reading it, I went back and re-read the ""rave review"" sound bites on the cover -- and found they are not for this novel but for Trigiani's Big Stone Gap series -- I'll pass."
4,"Easy, fun read!","I think this book is a wonderful, light, fun, read. Its has a good plot, great characters and I really was caught up in the story. This is a lay by the pool book, read it on the beach, or read it on the plane while going on your vacation or read it while you ride the bus to work (which I do).I enjoyed the characters, especially Lucia, and her descriptions of clothing and fasion during that era were facinating. The author is really descriptive.This book makes you smile, and I highly recommend it."
4,"Lucia, Lucia","This delightful novel would also make a great choice for any book discussion group. Discussion questions could include, ""What traditions do we remember with fondness, and others think, 'Good ridance?'"" ""In what ways is Lucia a pioneer for her generation?"" There are also some great passages. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and would recommend it to others."
2,Interesting,"I enjoyed this book, but found the author's writing style somewhat simplistic. But as a character, Lucia is a delight and is to be applauded for standing up for what she believes in and ""doing the right thing"" where and when it counts. She is a woman who is well ahead of her time (in the early 50s) and I enjoyed the descriptions of living on Commerce Street in Greenwich Village and amid a male dominated Italian family. She is an engaging character, but again, the author's writing style is pretty basic. This is a great beach read."
5,Adriana Swept Me Away,"Adriana Trigiani has a rare gift for gently sweeping her readers into a world that is filled with rich characters, inviting us into a story that feels like family. Lucia, Lucia is a tender and sweet story that is neither overly sentimental nor unrealistically dramatic. Adriana has woven together family relationships, romance, tragedy and nostalgia in a way that is comforting in its familiarity. I was left wanting to rush out, find an older person and listen to their life story.Readers who have enjoyed the Big Stone Gap triology will be especially thrilled with the new venue of Greenwich Village in Lucia, Lucia. Adriana's ability to vividly sketch people and places is as evident in New York as it has been in Virgina. Her wit and warmth make you feel as if you are a welcome guest whereever she takes you.Having just turned the last page, I enthusiastically recommend Lucia, Lucia, and head back to my own book shelves to revisit Big Stone Gap."
4,The ending ruins the story,"I received a copy of ""Lucia Lucia"" for Christmas and found it to be an enjoyable read. It's a story of a woman's strength to be who she feels she should be and not who she's expected to be. As other here have said, I wasn't thrilled with the ending. It felt a little disloyal to a woman who was so ahead of her time, so determined to live her own life.I realized after reading this from cover to cover, what was really expected of me as a daughter-in-law in an Italian family. I too shunned the old Italian ways and now see why I was never really accepted.""Lucia Lucia"" hit close to home for me but I believe it is limited by cultural interest."
4,"A fast, engaging read","The strength of this novel comes the sense of nostalgia it invokes as well as the complex family relationships that play out in the story. That said, the writing is pretty basic and the dialogue, contrived. Overall, this novel kept my interest and I finished it in a day."
4,Fun & easy read,"If you are looking for something light and heartfelt, Lucia, Lucia will fill the bill. Trigiani sets up a delightful story about the only daughter in an Italian immigrant family. Fashion lovers will enjoy reading about her career and romantics will be satisfied with the ending. Interesting characters and a couple of unexpected plot twists keep the story moving."
4,Easily Relatable,"As an Italian-American woman, I had to pick up this novel. The description is rather misleading. This book is about one woman's difficulty in figuring out her life's path. She struggles between her love for her career and her love for her traditional Italian-American family. Those family values remain the same, at least when you have Italian grandparents anyway. I thought this book was rather somber and not the light, fun read that the other reviewers seem to have found it. Even so, I enjoyed reading about Lucia and could really relate to her story."
4,"Lucia, Lucia","An excellent read, It captivated my attention! This is the firstbook I have read by Adriana Trigiani. I have already ordered 3 of her other novels. I'm sure they will delight!I felt Lucia's character was very real. The Sartori's travels to Italy were warm and familial. This book will touch your heartIt deals with weddings, death, love and close knit family bonds.I recommend it highly!"
4,Bittersweet moments,"I work in a bookshop so I was given an advance copy and I started reading it one afternoon without much thought. But it held my attention my entire afternoon and I finished it that evening.It is truly a sad story at times, showing how one's choices, (some incredibly simple) can dictate so much of a person's life.The title character, Lucia is an incredibly headstrong and independent person. Quickly she finds herself wanting more than life initially is offering and takes off in a new direction. She experiences anguish, but in the end she finds she is much stronger then she thought.The characters were endearing and all equally complicated. No one is truly awful, including the person who hurt Lucia the most.It is a fine example of the frailty of humans and how often people who love you the most, can equally hurt you the most."
4,Lucia Lucia,This was an enjoyable book.The main character is easy to relate to and the family situations were fun to read.
4,Very enjoyable read,"Being Italian and born and raised in Brooklyn, NY, I really enjoyed this book. Lucia is a girl before her time in the 50's but is also a little naive about love and life. It is a fun book, with heartwarming family life, happiness and some sadness but always enjoyable. I recommend this book. This is the first book I have read by this author but it will not be the last."
4,Great piece for the theater,My reader's group and I loved this one. Trigiani takes you into the world of fashion at a time when fashion really seemed glamourous and enchanting. This novel unwound itself in front of my eyes with the clarity of a stage performance. It would make great theater. It's a book certainly worth curling up with during a lazy weekend.
4,Good price.,"If you need a mouse that you won't fret if you loose it or break it by dropping it in the floor, this is the one. I bought this mouse to use with my laptop when I don't feel like using the touchpad. It has a middle button that can be customized to perform different fuctions, such as page down, home, end, or F1 through F12 function keys. However, its shape is not as ergonomic as more expensive mice."
3,Functionality we were looking for - for the most part,"This adapter doesn't quite fit the old mogul base floor lamp we have. It seems the bulb doesn't sit quite right in it, and sometimes the light flickers (a florescent bulb). Otherwise, it works pretty fine. The price was right - certainly a lot less than the expensive mogul bulbs."
1,NOT a 3-way socket,"I ordered this to be fully functional with a standard base 3-way bulb in a 3-way mogul socket, but does not function as a 3-way socket, just as a regular on-off function. This should be noted in the description so others will not be fooled as I was. I am still looking for a functional 3-way socket to adapt a standard size bulb to a mogul socket."
4,Mogul to medium base adapter.,Functions as advertised; I used it in an older covered outdoor yard light. I'm surprised that these adapters are not sold in hardware stores.
5,A life (and money) saver!,"This adapter allows you to skip buying those expensive mogul-sized bulbs (that is -- if you can even find them). I put a standard 100-watt bulb into the adapter, and it works like a charm! This is definitely the way to go, and it allows me to continue using my antique torch lamp, even though I can't find the bulbs locally anymore."
1,Doesn't fit in a mogul socket,"Don't bother. Medium base bulb screws in no problem, but the adapter won't screw into a mogul base socket. It gets about 1/2 turn in, then binds up."
2,Not a 3 Way,"Not a 3 way. This is an Amazon problem of incomplete description of their several of these. They should state clearly 2 way or 3 way. Actually I think in spite of selling several all of them are 2 way. Very careful and time consuming work with a 1/8"" masonry drill a piece of #12 wire and super glue will modify it into a 3 way (who cares about UL rating). But, most customers won't do this."
4,Pretty Good,"Although these books can't be compared to Laura's writing, they are still pretty good. This is where Caroline first meets Charles."
4,"Please, more Pa!","This series keeps getting better and better. I enjoyed reading about Pa's family, and the members that were around for the Big Dance, grown up, in The Big Woods.I guess my only complaint for this book and other books in the series is the lack of quality illustrations. Who can mimic Garth Williams exactly, but I the missing illustrations hurt visualizing some things that would be foriegn to readers 150 years later."
4,Glory Years is an 80's time warp,"Long, but very good retro comedy / drama with many familiar faces from the era. Not a classic but something different for those who think they've seen all 80's films. Tawney is hot so it really doesn't matter, watch it for her."
3,This Movie Really Bothered Me,"""The Todd Killings"" (1970) is an extremely odd movie about a 23 year old who hangs around with high-schoolers and kills some of them. Skipper is the epicenter of the hip social scene of a nondescript California burg: the guys want to emulate him and the girls want to love him. He's a strange cross between Charles Manson and Greg Brady. Simply for thrills, he kills a girl. He employs two of his friends in the effort to bury her body. Parents and police suspect him but they have no concrete evidence. Skipper is the hippie-antihippie, with long hair and a do-your-own-thing attitude, but his own-thing involves an extreme self-centeredness. While the movie is occasionally radical, it ultimately reaffirms bourgeois morality."
3,Pink Silicone Skin for Krazr K1M,"Overall the silicone case worth the price. The only complaint that I have about it is that the sides do not have a connector piece and they don't stay attached to the phone, but other than that one flaw its a great case."
2,Sound advice but use with utter care,"I read this book and started to put in practice the author's advice. Although some of the advice is sound and the program seems to work, please be careful. For example, I tried to eat only when I was hungry, which resulted in extreme weakness and other medical problems. As a result I had to give up the program after a week, had to take two weeks off work because I felt constantly weak and fainting and couldn't start a new diet for at least one month.The only useful advice is the one to exercise more. But that's hardly new, isn't it?"
5,Every woman should understand what's in this book.,"I picked this book from my personal shelf a year after buying it. A year into a successful change of life which resulted in a new way of eating. What I discovered is that this book thorougly explains how to control fat by keeping fuel in the furnace. Biggest lesson to be learned: NEVER SKIP MEALS. You don't save calories, you pump up your body's natural fat storing activity. Great book with lots of practical advice. You need to read through it, though. It's worth the effort."
4,Outsmarting the Female Fat Cell,"This is an excellent book and I would recommend it to all women who are fed up with diets that don't work. I am a personal trainer and I have used the information in this book to help many of my clients, with successfull results. This isn't a quick fix plan - it teaches you good eating habits for life and also stresses the impotance of exercise, which is essential for maintaining fat loss."
3,Only for extreme fans,This cd interview series is always lacking. It is not worth the money unless u are an extreme limp bizkit fan
4,Really Well Done But . . .,"Don Giovanni: The music was wonderful, the acting superb, the staging well done, but I'm conservative and old fashioned. Most operas seem to allude to illicit sex, adultery, drunkenness, murder, etc. I don't understand why just about all operas have to violate the laws of decency. Why can't some operas be wholesome and uphold family values?"
3,good review,"I watch all DVDs ,generaly it is good but it is not categrized well.it is like a conferrence report & so general"
5,Vitaly Important Research Material,"For those who like live presentations about important topics by major authors and experts on a subject, this DVD product delivers. I love recommending products that I care about and I only bother reviewing DVDs I like. Anything else is just a waist of my time. For anyone that really cares about the topic of the Shamanic use of Ayahuasca in the Amazon and the World at large for healing and transformation, this DVD product deserves a spot in your library right next to Shamans of the Amazon, another vital DVD product on this topic. Both of these products offer vital research material for anyone who cares about this subject. For those who are new to this topic, this is the kind of research material you will need to prepare, before you embark on any healing journey using Ayahuasca."
2,Not for USB port,"This keypad has a PS/2 connector. The box celebrates the KP17B numeric keypad is designed for Windows 95--and compatible with DOS, Windows 3.1, and Windows NT. Can't say whether the keypad works with Windows XP--because my Sony VAIO notebook doesn't even have a PS/2 adaptor. Buyer beware."
5,This keypad is great!,"If you find yourself in need of a keypad, this one is definitely the way to go. I use it for an MP3 player I built for my car, and it fits nicely between the two front seats. I'm very happy with the performance, its size, and the color goes well with the black interior of my car. I had to purchase a 6 pin DIN to 5 pin DIN adapter to get it to work with my system (it's not included), but it works well. Buy this today!!"
2,this is not a dust hood its a cover plate with opening,this is not a dust hood its a cover plate with a opening should have known better since their is no picture .. but if you type in dust hood this come up with the rest... wanted to use this for my miter saw this is really good for nothing its not deep enough to get a good vacuum effect but if you have a table saw that fits this dimension then you got a winner...
5,A great inexpensive way to make a contrator saw better,This really helped reduce the amount of cleaning I need to do after being int he shop. I have since upgraded to a Cabinet Saw and this will go to whoever buys the old contractors saw.
4,chrisrefill.com,"I have a Pro Tech 10"" table saw and this Dust hood does not fit. Works great once you make a board to fit your table saw and then attach dust hood to board."
2,"LOCKED, COCKED, and ready to DROP THE BOMB ON YOU!","When i found out that Rena Mero was actually doing something after she left the WWE I was surprised as hell! So with that in mind I purchased this film. I have to honestly say, it was not a total waste of money, it was a partial waste of money! This movie to me, made no sense, showed nothing but naked chics playing in the dirt, and some chic raping a heavily sedated king (can you do that?)so she could be queen or something! I have to say that the biggest issue here was the lack of violence! I was hoping for at least one Sablebomb or a couple brawls, but there wasn't! If you are looking for some good Sable action check out WrestleMania XX or the Great American Bash!"
2,What I expected,"Anyone who buys this film and then wants to be a critic should just stop. I did not buy this expecting a great storyline or super acting or unrepetitive filming. Nobody else does either. This is a movie to watch when you don't have anything better to do. If you want to see scantily clad women on film then buy it, but don't be a critic either."
3,Fun toy; broken after 3rd use,"My son really enjoys this toy. He is a gentle 5 year old; but still the toy is broken less than one month after Christmas. It snapped off where the mouthpiece attaches to the mask. Luckily, my daughter has the girl version of this toy; which she feels at the age of 7 she is too old for. So, my son is reluctantly using the pink mask to hold his bug pieces and receiver so that he can continue to play with his mask."
2,Bring Out Your Dead T-Shirt,Ordered a medium. Wasn't even close to that size. Had to reorder a large so that the recipient would be able to wash and dry it without fear that it would be a size small after the first trip through the laundry. Wasn't worth the extra postage on top of the original shipping charges to send it back.
2,Not a typical Wallace effort,"An immensely disappointing novel, especially from an author like Wallace. The plot was thin. I now know exactly what people refer to when calling characters cardboard- there was little to no character development. And realism? The 6-year old son of Noy speaks of his various classes in school: arithmetic, geography, history- a 6 year old? And he complains how lame one arithmetic class is. Also, President Underwood demands that the secret service not cover him while he confronts ""the bad guy"". Not to worry- they outfit him with a gun! Not realistic at all, in my opinion.I've read a number of Wallace's books: The 3 Sirens, The Plot, The Second Lady, and The Almighty. These were excellent, riveting books. Perhaps Wallace was not well at this time, because this novel is a shadow of the others."
4,If you have the game buy the book!!!,"This book is great to help you play World Series Baseball 2k1. It tells you all the stats, how to create double plays, how to pitch, and how the teams rank in World Series Baseball 2k1.If I was you I would buy the book and go all the way in your season."
4,Great watch,Just what I wanted. A solar powered watch that looks good. The auto-light function is pretty cool. My only beef is that I wish it were a bit slimmer.
4,Fun to play with,"I bought this toy for my disabled daughter for Christmas. When I received it I played with it for at least an hour before I wrapped it. It takes some getting used to, pushing the button and recording at just the right time, and with the right emphasis on your words. It is a great idea and once you get used to it it's a lot of fun. However, I don't know if my disabled daughter will be able to work it right. We'll find out on Christmas morning! I don't think this would be a good toy for a young child, under 3, but for older children I think it would be great."
3,Fun but short lasting,"This makes a great carry along car toy for my granddaughter (4). Even her 12 year old brother enjoys it. However, after a mere 3 months use the sound has become distorted, even with new batteries! I'll be checking the warranty information."
3,"Fun, but recording could be better.","The kids (6 and 4) had lots of fun with this the first two days, and though it hasn't been picked up since, it will surely make other appearances. There is something of a problem with the recording - it tends to cut off the beginning and end of what you say and can be hard to understand - even when adults speak carefully and loudly."
4,My five year old LOVES this!!,"The Cranium folks score again. My daughter got this as a Christmas present and loves, loves, loves it.This is a great toy for late toddler and up. Using very easy to understand technology, kids record their own stories, if you are familiar with MAD LIBS it's the same premise but uses a recorder instead of writing. My daughter has as much fun playing with it by herself as she does playing with Mom, Dad, or her brother. This is a wonderful toy to travel with because it is a single hand-held unit, no extra pieces except an optional spinner to select stories.Unique, imaginative, easy to use - a HIT!"
4,Just a tip for those reviewers,"I just received the toy today. I'm early Christmas shopping and since Christmas isn't for a couple of months I figured i'd try it out to see if it was working otherwise it would be to late to return if i wait til Christmas. When i turned it on the voice was slow and distorted it sounded awful so i changed the batteries. But even with new batteries the voice was still slow and distorted. I read the directions and troubleshoot section and it mentioned to reset the recorder if there were any problems. So i got a paperclip and insert it into the reset button. WA-LA it's all better. The voice is now fun and exciting and it works well.So for those of you who have had trouble with the voice maybe if you reset the toy it will do the trick. As far as the funness of the toy, I'll have to wait until Christmas to see if my 5 year old enjoys it.I think he will."
5,An encompassing review of fundamental concepts,"The entries, and average of four or five paragraphs long, are detailed enough to send the reader in the right direction should he desire a more in-depth treatment, and aquaint one with all of the fundamental points of any given concept presented. Very well done."
5,personal enlightenment,I think this is a very useful and enlightening reference book for many of the key and mind-twisting ideas in history. Reading this book is a real treat and I can lose track of time as I jump from one topic to another. Anyone who wants to build his humanities and to go on a journey to understand the society of his own time should learn from this book. The Key Ideas in Human Thought is really an amazing book and a jumping board for me in the way an intellectual should look at the world and his space in it.
5,Christmas Gift,Thanks great timing and good price for Chirstmas Gift. It was exactly what he wanted and a great price for me!
2,season 2 not accurate,season 1 works fine and is just as described. season 2 however has four disks with disks 1 and 2 having the same content and not different episodes. disk 3 and 4 work fine but the episodes that are supposed to be on 3 are on 4 and vice versa. the product works fine other than the problems mentioned above
2,There was an entire blank disc.,"It seemed like a great value to get the two seasons for 20 bucks, but yeah, that's because there was an disc with the last 6 episodes missing. I was upset about that, but I had it shipped to my fiance where he's stationed because he does not get cable, and i'm not gonna make him go through any trouble to send it back to me or the seller. So, basically won't be buying from the seller who sold us this again."
5,very good shoe,i recommend these shoe to everyone because them fit so good on my baby's little feet not like other these shoe's are so comforable my baby can wear them all day and not want them off
5,Grandma from Nebraska,I ordered these shoes for my grandson in Michigan. I knew K-Swiss was good quality because my two sons used to wear this brand. The shoes fit my grandson perfectly.
1,Hard top flap,"It is unfortunate. After wearing the shoes for a week, the shoe gives a black mark on top of my daughter's right foot because the flap is too hard and long for her. Since she have already wore them for a few days... I am reluctant to ask for a refund."
3,Meant to order wide shoes with velcro,"I was so intent on finding ""wide"" toddler shoes, that I overlooked the shoelaces. We wanted velcro shoes, so ended up returning these."
5,Soo Cute!,"I purchased this shoe for my 2 year old daughter. It is extra cute and extra durable. Best of all, I didn't even have to leave my home to get them! I am officially an amazon junkie!"
3,K Swiss,I purchased these K Swiss because they were a wide. Once I put them on my son they weren't very wide at all.
2,Might Be able to Make it Work,"I expected a dust connector from Delta, designed for Delta 6"" joiners would ""bolt up"" to a Delta 6"" Joiner. That's not the case. Other than duct tape, I'm not sure how to install this item on the joiner."
4,Much more than Trip-Hop...,"Portishead is much more than trip-hop. Listening to them is like witnessing the moody, organic sounds of jazz joining with the abstract sounds of Steve Riech and then throwing it on the turn-table of the peanut butter wolf.Beth's approach in this work is moving in its self. Her haunting voice becons you to listen closer. With out her, this would be boring and average music.The strings are a nice touch to the album, so are the guitars on ""Over"". Overall, I wish they would have lost the sci-fi element, other than that this is excellent music to end a night.Rating: A-"
4,try it with headphones,"First, I gave 4 stars because I'm hesitant to bestow the ultimate on anything. Second, this CD is more cohesive and assured than ""Dummy"" which is also very good. But back to the headphones: put them on, turn this up as loud as you can take it, close your eyes and concentrate on the amalgam of sound. You think it's incredible coming out of speakers? Have every bit of it spill into your ears. Production is amazing and has at times brought tears to my jaded eyes. The art of it all! Beautiful! I want to live! Hopefully, Beth will hang in there and P-head will make another."
2,disappointing,"""dummy"" is a watershed album, so in all fairness, the follow-up never had a chance in my eyes/ears. i was hoping for ""dummy partII"" or ""dummer"". thought the strings, and cinematic outlook of this album was dull. donde esta the beats and textures that haunted me on ""dummy""."
3,I had higher expectations,"I had seen two music videos for this CD and thought it was going to be great. After listening to all the tracks, I only liked maybe three. I am a heavy trip-hop and acid jazz fan, but this was just psychidelic junk. It was like a whiny, down-beat version of aphex twin. I guess, if thats your thing... buy it NOW!"
2,worst sounding mix ever,This must be the worst sounding mix ever for a popular album. The vocal EQ is painful. Why don't they remix and remaster this mess?I'm listening to it through a graphic equalizer (iTunes) with 4K pulled out and there is a great album lurking in there somewhere.
1,Dreadful,"Absolutely dreadful and just plain irritating to listen to. If I could rate this with zero stars instead of one, I would!"
1,Nada que ver,"Ni punto de comparacion con Dummy, se perdio la esencia del Grupo espero que vuelvan a ser los de antes."
2,Buy Dummy Instead,"Dummy is a fantastic album, but unfortunately this one is not nearly as good. The sound is muddier and none of the songs really stick with me. Skip it."
3,IN A HALF-LIT WORLD,"Another stunning Portishead album... the opening track is glorious, as is the second track. Overall Portishead knows how to put together a satisfying album which reaches the listener, entertaining and touching. There is an overall effect the album in its entirety creates, setting a mood. I do not love this album the way I loved the previous album, but I am particularly fond of ""Mourning Air""."
3,Disappointed,I am sorry to say that I was a bit disappointed by this album. I really loved 'Dumb' and had high expectation for this one.
4,A step forward,"Portishead's eponymous second effort is, for me anyway, the superior example of their sound. The LP is more of a slow burn than their debut, the beats are more thoroughly cultivated high drama which work beautifully with Beth Orton's delicate delivery. I know I will receive some detractors but, here goes, ahem...'Dummy' was a bit too reliant on gimmicks and obvious ""hip-hop"" cliches and I think the tunes fly by a bit. Thankfully on ""Portishead"" they opted to go a bit deeper and the result is a more engrossing listen. Recommended. Also check ""Live at Roseland""."
4,Self-titled release reveals a deeper meaning.....,"In Portishead's new self titled release, a lot of the same styles are revealed such as beats in ""Only You"" and ""Uncertainty"". Beth Gibbons voice again reveals its versatility...On ""Cowboys"" she can be compared to Bjork, as with the contrast of ""Only You"" where her seductive head tones add a new meaning to the song's point of view. Though this album is not as catchy as ""Dummy"", the songs are much more haunting and chilling. ""All Mine"" includes some interesting horn parts, as well as some wild vocal melodies on Gibbons' part, on ""Elysium."" All in all, this album does not fail to impress me...it keeps me wanting more of Portishead's unusual and seductive style."
5,Incomparable,"Within its genre, Dummy was a great album. But this, much darker and more complex, record packs a far greater punch and simply transcends its predecessor. In years to come, this will be the one you are reaching for..."
4,Solid.,"I like this album. I prefer Dummy but this is a solid effort. Portishead is just cool music, moody and different."
2,Overwrought vocals mar excellent instrumentation,"The Amazon site ""if you like this artist"" led me to buy this disc unheard (Who can get RealAudio to work properly anyway?) I had read about them in Spin, so I gave it a shot. The music is fantastic; ""a 50s sci-fi/horror flick vibe"" as one reviewer described it, is accurrate. But instead of understated cool-jazz like vocals, Beth's singing is overly mannered, doesn't match the music behind her, and grates like a nails on a blackboard."
3,"extremely disappointing at first, now addicted","It was like listening to the very few parts of Dummy I didn't like for an entire CD. Way too much gratuitous scratching, and screechy vocals for may taste. Extremely disappointing.It's now perhaps six months after I wrote the paragraph above and I am completely addicted to this album. Cinematic trip goth at its very very best"
2,dummy without the melody,"really 2.5 stars. WAY overrated! what happened to the melody? Dummy was far superior, and it seems that everyone is just echoing the press. i don't get it. i guess if you REALLY want more portishead it's good enough, but otherwise, play it on your porch on halloween to scare off trick-or-treaters."
5,Hauntingly alternative,"Not atuned to the music of Portishead, the CD came a bit of shock. Not so much the alternative sound, but my inabilty to tune it off. Next on the agenda ""Dummy"". Awesome sound. Not for the Matchbox20 fans."
5,6 STARS!!!,"Spellbing and hypnotic. Jazz, trip hop, torch songs and a touch of errieness make this the ultimate album for those post-dawn soul searches. WHY DON'T YOU BUY THIS NOW?"
5,A good view of a farming life in Britian,"Having watched Jacks TV serise of the same name it is great to read of the childhood behind it and perhaps to "" remove the rose coloured glasses"" people love to wear when they wax lyrical about the Good old days. His farming Background gives us a look at the the life of the 'Old Man' and his mother and here is a man who can really speak out on the pro's and cons of Fox hunting, and give us some happy and some sad stories to listen too"
4,"Limited Edition, Remastered!!!!!","I recently purchased this cd. It is ""Lovingly Remastered"".""Desperate"" was a solid rock album all the way through. Highlight is ""Elsie"". An intimate(dark) look inside an isolated disturbed mind. I purchased this disc before I knew whether or not it was a remaster. I already own the original release, it was worth the risk of duplication!After Desperate ""The Divinyls"" were oriented towards singles, all albums pale in comparison.When an individual reads a review, one hopes the reviewer will tell kindred spirits about the product in hand. Instead, often we get a unoriginal run down of what is already posted on a web site, printed in the liner notes or published in an autobiography."
4,A wonderful story of torment of suicide & joy of new love,"As an avid reader of Anita's work, this book was terrific. For mormon readers that question the here-after and the love Heavenly Father sends our way. The outcome was a welcome surprise. May Thomas and Mallory survive the future."
3,Very good product,The only reason I'm giving 3 stars is because it took forever to get this.I almost miss it (as I had to leave on vacation) - and planned to give it as a gift.
5,just right,Absolutely addictive. It is affordable and I always have men smelling on me. Women always ask what it is. I love it.
5,excellent,"I just like it!!!!!!!!!!!!!Must agree it, can't be worn at bedtime. Why? Because you won't fall asleep. IT'S SUGAR"
1,sunshine,"Very disappointed. The perfume does not smell like it is supposed to when you spray it on. I would be the first to know how it is supposed to smell as it is the ONLY perfume I have worn for the past 3-4 years so I purchase it or receive it as a gift quite regularly. If I had to guess at the problem it is either the perfume is very old ( been on the shelf for well over a year ), or they are selling knock-off perfumes. Whatever the case I am very disappointed in this purchase. It has made me rethink purchasing anything from Amazon other than kindle books, so I have not bought anything else from Amazon since. Also, I did register a complaint with Amazon to which they have not responded. The seller, who I also complained to did contact me, but never followed through in sending me my $ back or an Amazon gift card for the purchase amount. They also maintained their perfumes were 100% real yet some of their statements regarding this matter were not in line for this product."
1,This has to be a fake,"I have worn Pink Sugar for over a year and love it. I bought my first bottle at Sephora and loved it, had no issues. When I first started using this bottle, I didn't suspect anything since it does smell the same to me, but I am allergic to it! I break out in hives every time I wear it and this never happened with the bottle I bought at Sephora. Obviously something is in here that wasn't in the original. I came back here to search to see if anyone else noticed anything off and there are a couple of other reviews that also say it's fake."
5,!!!!!!!!!,"This is my daily/work perfume. I LOVE IT! I get compliments all the time. I smell like CAKE. Cake people! What's better than smelling like cake all day? NOTHING. I use their partner perfume PS Sensual, layered over it for a quick after work date scent refresher and they complement each other well."
5,love it,Bought it for my friend and she just loves this watch! She tells me she's been getting lots of compliments about it!
4,I'm positively surprised,"I had a hard time choosing the right camera, I was between the Cuddeback and this Bushnell 9200, chose this own. Installed 4 normal batteries and it worked great for 4 days then they were dead.During this time, it worked very well, good response time and good pictures, specially if compared to the price ! The flash range is only about 4-5 yards, same for the trigger distance.But for this price I'm very happy and will buy more. Will see if I can connect a bigger recharchable battery to it so I can leave it for some weeks unattended."
3,RENT FIRST!!!,"If you can find this movie for rent, i would say rent it before buying,some of the love scenes were hot,but it's pretty much late night cable nudity.the story is about a device that can bring out sexual desires in anyone it comes in contact with.And of course it keeps falling into the wrong hands,and a lot of sex insues.PLOT SOUND FAMILAR? yeah i know,another movie based on ""MILO MANARA'S CLICK"" premise i think this one of five other movies like this.But if you like these kind of films this is your movie,it also stars Jacqueline Lovell(Sara St.James as she's also known)maybe that's why i gave this movie 3 stars instead of 1."
