4,"Rock n Roll Duty,Tangle Of Love & This Dream.","1989- Rock n Roll Duty ,Tangle Of Love & This Dream.The 3 songs i like the best of the album/cd"
4,Title says it all,ROCKLAND is a rocking release from Kim Mitchell so the title is appropriate. Sometimes I hear a little of the softer side that reminds me of Toto in Mitchell's songs but I don't mind.
3,Good Material for a Book,"This book was useful and sort-of interesting, and I bet that it looksgood as part of the package when the authors are trying to get tenure,but it reads like a report from the UN.""Spying on the Bomb"" is much better written, even if itcovers slightly different material.So, if you have a professional interest or if you need to havea copy of every relevant book on this topic, then go for it.Otherwise, read something more mainstream. My all-time favoriteis ""The Curve of Binding Energy""."
4,A good beat,"This song has cool lyrics, a good beat, and a nice flow. This is something you can dance to; do yard work with,listen while to clean the house. Every time i hear it it makes me want to dance and smile because of it's great beat. Sheryl crow has done some good songs in her past and this has to be one of her best."
3,Good but not great.,Interesting pictures but no real help in text. I think I will keep it for reference only. Good ideas in it.
5,"Garden mosiacs, as taught by a master - terrific book!","I bought this book to learn a bit about making mosaics, but I got far more in the bargain. Very nicely photographed and illustrated, the reader will feel inspired to start making their projects, secure in the knowledge tht they will succeed. This is a worthy addition to those seeking to make a valuable addition to their personal library of knowledge."
5,Very good book,"This book has many creative projects, it clearly explains several techniques, including good details, list of materials needed and very useful information. There are several different techniques and original projects. Excellent information that will be very useful for making your own outdoor projects. Highly recommended."
1,"Definately no his best work,","This is definately not some of his best work. It does not have the beat or the feelings that he so carefully and whole heartedly put into his earlier albums.I am a long time fan Percy Sledge and can remember my Mother listening to his music back in the day, 30 some odd years ago.He's an artist that knows what to say when someone is suffering from a broken heart that nothing can heal but the warmth and tenderess of the person they are longing for."
5,Fantastic and original!,"Books with serious data on old Karate-do Masters' biography are not common, unfortunately. This one comes right to hit this spot. Learning Karate-do is far from being only punching and kicking. We need to learn and exercise other aspects, as already said by the Masters Nagamine presents in this book: philosophical, moral and historical aspects. Knowing the history, you know better your Karate-do. In addition, this book presents some peculiar aspects of Okinawan history and tradition (dance, Tegumi wrestling, etc.) and Nagamine's view of ""Karate and Zen as one"", presenting Zazen theory and exercises to complete the book in great style."
3,Above average zombie flick,"(aka The Living Dead at Manchester Morgue)Above average zombie flick with heavy doses of gut-eating, brain-snacking, heart-chomping gore (in the second half), also characterized by an eerie soundtrack and decent voice-dubbing (it's a Euro-blend production). The zombie makeup is mediocre, but the zombies themselves are pretty creepy - relentless and shambling at times, but quick during certain moments. The story takes place against a back-drop of early-70s counterculture and the very early environmental movement, with blithely ignorant science acting as the unwitting impetus behind the ensuing horror. I liked this movie much more than other Euro-zombie flicks I've seen. In the interest of full disclosure, I suppose I should say that I think most of the latter which other people tend to like, I myself think are overrated. Let Sleeping Corpses Lie, however, is fun."
4,70's Movie Not Bad,"Well for a British movie of the 1970's, this one is not bad, this Zombie movie has it all, nudity, gore, suspense, a graveyard, non beliving cops, but the best part of it all is how the zombies come to life, it will make you laugh. Still it has momements of edge of your seat suspense and ripping bloody moments. It even has an introduction by the director of the movie who lets you know this is a movie that should cause you fear."
4,Cool zombie flick!,Intelligent story line. The lead male and most of the others aren't terrible actors. Make up is good. Nice surround sound. I like it very much!!!
3,"mostly eerie, a bit inept","This film has a lot going for it, a thoroughly downbeat mood, lush but not overly-pretty cinematography, an outstanding use of sound for suspense, and some stunning and truly creepy sequences. All of these have aged well for this viewer and zombie fan. The lack of any depth of emotional involvement and the police-versus-youth schtick hasn't, and comes across as heavy-handed, even for its time. Overall, though, it's worth watching and wading through the padding and sequences of cars driving through the foggy countryside. The first appearance of a zombie, heralded first by sound and empty spaces (and in broad daylight) is classic, even if it feels more derivative than homage to a similar scene in the influencial NIGHT OF THE LVING DEAD. The gore, while mostly of the ""far too loose parts stuffed into a hollowed torso"" variety, is effective as well. The flashbulb sequence is delightfully classic Euro-horror as well. Also, bonus points for the great intro by the director."
3,"""Night of the Living Dead"" spanish style","Directed by Jorge Grau (director also of ""Ceremonia sangrienta"", good vision about Countess Bathory, better than Hammer's), this is a Spanish-Italian version of ""Night of the Living Dead"", in colour and with a very seventies ecological vision. Very good directed, with good performances, it's perhaps the best imitation of George A. Romero's masterpiece."
4,A different kind of zombie.....,"This movie gets four stars from me because of its utter strangeness, and because the lead protagonist sounds just like Nigel Tufnel from Spinal Tap. A device is employed to kill insect pests by means of ultrasonic radiation. This machine also, ostensibly by accident, turns infants into flesh-hungry little monsters, and resurrects the dead, the latter of which can in turn make more zombies. The zombies are fairly lethargic, if not uninspired, though they perk right up when it comes to eating guts. Anyway, the Nigel Tufnel sound-alike and his pretty, redheaded girlfriend take to the countryside, dodging both zombies and cops, trying to solve the mystery. Meanwhile, the undead contagion spreads rapidly---it seems that the zombies can only be destroyed by fire. Would I recommend this movie? Yes, as long as you're in for surreal entertainment. And, best of all, there are no ""Gates of Hell"" to be found anywhere."
4,'..Sleeping Corpses' is a sleeper!,"Sure 'Night' and 'Dawn' are confirmed zombie classics, but if you want something a little darker, a little more atmospheric, and a whole lot of popcorn-munching fun, check out 'Let Sleeping Corpses Lie'. Zombie fans who slam this film for being too slow or plodding are missing the point-sure it's not wall-to-wall action and gore but if you ask me, that's what elevates it. It's stately pace and low-key style make the later scenes of carnage and zombie mayhem all the more jarring. It helps to watch 'Sleeping' without the images of other wall-to-wall action/ zombie epics in your brain-after all-it's a film that pretends that no other zombie flicks exist. Killer photography, a jazzy score, a cool old-fashioned storyline,and a gorgeous yet creepy locale all highlight this zombie thriller. So, turn off the lights, bolt the door, and get some perverse thrills from a sorely underrated horror gem."
1,Bad bad bad! movie,"I don't get it. I read the reviews and order the movie if it sounds interesting. This one sounded like a new/old classic (old movie, new to me) and I ordered it eagerly based on the reviews.People, this movie was awful. Even the gore wasn't good. The violence wasn't real. I felt like the entire movie was a prelude showing pre-credits except that it last 1.5 hours. Not good. Don't waste your money or time.Last, to Anchor Bay, quit buying bad horror movies and issuing them in tin boxes. Buy good horror movies and ship them any old way and you'll have me as a customer for life."
2,Boring,This movie started off ok but 50 mintutes into it your waiting for something to happen and when you do see the zombies you just dont care anymore it has some good atmosphere but moves at a turtles pace it was just an ok zombie movie buy it with the Fright pack mayb youll like it but I didnt.. To sum this up I dont think its a zombie classic just a boring movie.
5,"IT WAS THE CORPSES,THE CORPSES !","AKA THE LIVING DEAD AT THE MANCHESTR MORGUE THIS IS A REALLY GOOD HORROR MOVIE.THE ACTING,MAKE UP FX,MUSIC AND DIRECTION ARE ALL FIRST RATE AND THE PEAK DISTRICT (NOT LAKE DISTRICT) LOCATIONS GIVE THE FILM A VERY EERIE FEELING TO IT."
5,Anchor Bay Rocks with this Exceptional Zombie Shocker!,"I had the fortune of seeing it via bootleg video tape years ago and now Anchor Bay has released it in a GORGEOUS, pristine transfer - it sounds and looks just incredible!The film itself is a gem - one of the very best zombie films ever made. Eerie, atmospheric and well-acted. The zombies, though not as plentiful as in a Romero or Fulci film, are cool-they lumber around with a very creepy, distinct freshness about them. The suspense builds well and the attacks become icnreasingly gruesome so if you're a gorehound there should be enough to keep you seated and if you're not... well, you can just cover your eyes for a few hair-raising scenes of gut munching.This is an excellent disc, and along with the Argento releases and Fulci's ""The Beyond"", stands as the top horror title of the year!"
5,THIS IS A REAL ZOMBIE FLICK!!!!!!ONE OF THE BEST EVER!!!!!!,"I am so glad i got this GREAT!!!zombie flick on DVD.this movie is just as great as anything FULCI or ROMERO ever made.this is one of my very FAVORITE!!zombie movies,it has everything i look for in a zombie flick.VERY VERY SPOOKY/VERY ARTISTIC(especialy some of the camera work!!)DECENT ACTING/ABSOLUTELY SUPERB DIRECTING/& A DECENT AMOUNT OF BLOOD & GORE(not alot but with everything else above going for it id say it was the perfect amount!!)anyway if you are a true ZOMBIE fan & or euro/italian horror fan in genral then your going to love this flick & if your not one or the other but your looking for a spooky little horror movie then rent or buy im sure you won't be discruntled!!!!!! LIKE I SAID THIS IS A REAL ZOMBIE FLICK!!!!!! ONE OF THE BEST EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,A great zombie movie,"Very close in tone to the original ""Night of the Living Dead"". A newly-invented machine sends out vibrations intended to make harmful insects become aggressive toward each other and kill themselves off. Unfortunately, recently-deceased humans have residual intelligence in their dying brains which is at approximately the same level as insect brains... so, naturally, the corpses animate and aggressively try to cannibalize humans. The one living human who realizes what is happening finds complete disbelief as he tries to warn people. As the zombie plague spreads, we wonder what the outcome will be... The bug-killing machine is fine-tuned and begins affecting a larger and larger area. Will the world fall to the growing number of homicidal zombies?"
3,What's with the nude woman?,"This is a pretty good ""living dead"" movie--but nowhere near as good as the classic ""Night of the Living Dead"" as some people claim. I still have no idea what the nude woman is in the beginning of the movie for. It's definitely worth watching and owning if you collect horror movies. I didn't find this movie to be scary but it was entertaining."
2,Routine zombie film,"This film starts out okay but quickly turns boring as a drug investigation starts unfolding, it is not until half of the movie has already gone by, that the zombies finally appear, the result is a tedious film that is completely predictable with mediocre acting, a silly script and not very much to recommend it."
2,BORING!!,"I LOVE zombie movies, and, I don't really expect a lot from them....really, to be fair, as generally, they go more for the gore, than any real plot/acting/etc..This one, however, was a BIG let-down.It starst out ok, you have the typical government/scientific experiment goes awry and brings back the dead thing going on.The acting, really isn't that bad either.The biggest problem that I had with this one, is that it drags on entirely too long!There is some gore, including a good hospital morgue scene...but, the movie could have been paced faster and over a good 30 minutes sooner.Not the worst I've seen, but, DEFINATELY not the best....save your money, rent this one if you can, instead!"
3,"Best of ""Light""","I suppose the classics are here. Miss Me Blind, Karma Chameleon, Time (Clock of the Heart), Do You Really Want to Hurt Me. But there's not much else worth the trouble. If this album truly represents their best output, these guys didn't have much great stuff."
1,at worst...the best of boy george and culture club,There wasn't much of the original culture club stuff. the old culture club cd's would have been better. I never listened to it again after the 1st time!
3,"not the best of the '80s, but not the worst","Hey, remember the '80s? Big hair, tight pants, awful pop music. Right? Not exactly. Culture Club provided the world with some solid, if not groundbreaking, pop songs. There's something (almost) any music fan could like here. Culture Club split genres (and genders) in their own unique way, and it's worth a listen.This compilation covers most of the highlights from the group's early '80s heyday; casual listeners should recognize most of the first part of the disc. Boy George's solo work is chronicled on the last half. Unless you REALLY love Boy George, this part will not be familiar (or very likable, in my opinion). It's kind of like Japenese pop music: you either get it or don't. I didn't get it, but that's just me.Overall, there is a lot to like here, but the second half could be a downer, unless you are really into Culture Club and Boy George."
3,Purchased for someone else,"Told it was a good CD with all the classic Boy George tunes.Personally, I would not recommend it unless that's your kind of sound....but the person I got it for was thrilled!"
1,be careful,"if you are looking at this book and ""The Fruitful Darkness: A Journey Through Buddhist Practice and Tribal Wisdom""...they are the same book with different covers. I ordered both thinking they were separate books and they ae NOT. I am quite irritated."
3,well,"Joan Halifax is a charismatic roshi, chaplainness and ex-shamaness. The woman has been through a lot with Grof, Huichols, Maezumi, Varela and all kinds of indigenous and non-indigenous celebrities. If contemporary Buddhism has globetrotting grey eminences, Halifax and Richard Gere would be primi inter pares.My unease with this book has to do with the need to record and publish our personal lives for the world to see. It's a form of narcissism and it takes, imo, away from the magic of a life. at the very least, one capitulates to the myth-of-oneself as well as to the publisher. For the zennie.... it kind of defeats the purpose. To study the self, one needs to forget the self... :)i don't think this book adds to Joan's aura, formidable as it is. It detracts from it."
3,"Sorry to dissent, but...","Adventure fiction written anywhere from 1890 to 1944 is a favorite of mine. I DO love Rohmer, Howard and Burroughs and am constantly on the lookout for a new author. When a little bit of research led me to Talbot Mundy (and a little more research led me to Khyber Rifles) I was excited. I got over it. While the plot and story are passable, almost nothing happens. The entire novel is an exercise in ""what happens next?"" while nothing happens next.My other complaint is in the character development. While the author creates many memorable characters throughout the book, Athelstan King, the principle character, isn't one of them. For the most part Mundy never really lets us ""see"" who King is. He tells us. Every other page has a paragraph telling us how witty he is or noble he is. I'd rather infer through his actions, personally.On the plus side, Mundy truly creates the look and feel of India. If that is enough, you will enjoy this book. If you are expecting Haggard, you will not."
4,This isn't Tyrone Powers' King,"I saw this title and decided to give it a try. I had seen the movie King of the Khyber Rifles and wanted to read the story to see how it compared to the movie. Well there is a big difference. The book is only remotely like the movie. To go into details would spoil both movie and book. I did however enjoy the book. The story is set in India of the Raj at the beginning of World War I. King is sent on a mission to the Khyber Pass to stop possible rebellion among the hill tribesmen. So much for the plot anymore and I tell the whole story.The author, Talbot Mundy, wrote this in the period of the Pulps. This is shown by the long passages, which are characteristic of writing from this period. If you are a fan of the Robert Howard non-Conan stories, which are set in a more modern era or a fan Kipling and his stories of India. Then by all means read King of the Khyber Rifles. It will show the high adventure of the Pulp Era of story telling."
5,"Finally, the Perfect Apple!","Teachers receive a lot of gifts; the best that can be said about many of them is, ""It's the thought that counts."" Here is a gift the teacher will treasure because the thought does count for so much. With poetry of eloquent simplicity and photography of heart warming artistry, Jane Gibson has created the perfect gift for teachers. The matching accessories allow considerable budgetary flexibility but just the inexpensive book by itself is a treasure. If your child's teacher deserves more than trite greeting cards and overripe fruit, this is exactly what you are looking for. I hope this is just the first of many specialty books from a most talented writer/photographer!"
1,Another Teacher's Name Inside,Why in the world would you send me a book that has a personal message to another teacher and her name inside? I can't possibly give this to my grandchild's teacher. I would think you would be smarter than this.I need a phone number to call you. This is unacceptable and I need a book with nothing written in it. I need it by June 8th.Susan Pearson
5,Reliable Product & Seller,"SanDisks have proven to be reliable, and so has this seller. I received exactly what I ordered, in a reasonable time."
5,Good CF card,"I was happy with this purchase. I was looking for a card for my Digital SLR, and wanted one with fairly fast write speed, but didn't want to spend much money. This card was exactly what I was looking for. It's large enough to fit many photos, and I was pleasantly surprised at how fast it writes. For the price, it more than met my expectations."
5,Perfect Complement,"I use this card with a Canon Rebel XTi. I have yet to experience any delays due to speed (or any other reason for that matter). No problems to date, and able to keep up with the quick speed of the XTi."
5,It was the best shopping i have ever done.,"best quality, fast shipping, everything i like it!!Thank you~I am gonna shop at amazon again.."
1,Lost Budapest Photos,"I was in the middle of my second day of a long awaited trip to Budapest when this card died. I was using my new Canon Rebel XT, which had no problems with my 1 GB cards throughout my 17 day trip. I lost an entire day of photos. I would not recommend this product to anyone!"
4,SanDisk is the trusted brand in CF,I only buy the SanDisk brand CF cards. That is what works in my applications (Leica TPS/GPS data storage).Thanks Amazon for having prices I can justify buying and have my company reimburse me!
1,SanDisk ultra II - 2.0GB,Without mishandeling my card. It malfunctioned in the first month. It came up with corrupted files. So it appears to be faulty. So obviously my review is bad news.
2,I knew to stay away from scan disk!,"I have never liked this brand but was assured at my high end camera store to be a good quality disk and so I bought the package with the card reader. Card reader after only a dozen or so times went faulty on me and then lost all the pictures on the disk. For me, I was pleased I know to change a disk and not put all eggs in one basket. The fact I only have the Wedding first dance is not good however. I blame it on the card reader. I would still look at other brands that have worked better for me. I shoot with a Cannon 20D with my new (I have to brag) L series lenses I bought from Amazon."
3,CompactFlash Card Ultra II,Pensé que iva a ser un producto mas rapido y no es así. De momento solamente tengo ocupada la memoria a la mitad y no se realmente si compensa pagar de mas por este tipo de tarjeta. Yo la utilizo en una Canon A550 y comparandolas con las compactflash estandar no siento que haya diferencia en velocidad.
5,A great deal for the money...........................,Short and sweet-this card is everything it claims to be. Another quality product from Sandisk.
2,Be Wary of Ace Photo Digital,"The card itself is a great card. However, be wary of ordering this card through Ace Digital Photo - make sure to click on a different seller including directly from Amazon. The card Ace Digital Photo sent me, although advertising retail box, was used and filled with many photos taken by someone else."
1,Not Happy!,"Amazon did not make clear in the specs what memory card was required for the D40x, since it's impossible to get human assistance: so now I'm stuck with this card which is completely useless to me."
2,bad servie,"amazon's standard shipping should be 5-7 days, but if you use their free shipping, it will take actually over at least 10 days. i placed order Oct.17, the expected delivery is 30 Oct., very bad."
5,"Easy transaction, good price","Just the right size card for RAW images and with the consistent good results from San Disk. Good price, arrived ahead of schedule"
2,2.0 GB memory card,"I bought a Canon Digital EOS Rebel XT camera with a 2.0 GB memory card. The camera has been great but the memory card turned out to be defective. I bought the camera and kit just before a trip to Yellowstone park. While there, I took almost 500 pictures and I reviewed them on the camera while out there. They looked fine. The trouble started when I got home and tried to transfer the pictures to my computer. I lost about 150 pictures because the files got corrupted while down loading. I tried another card I have and the pictues down loaded fine. I would highly recommend the camera but not the memory card."
4,Fast and reliable card so far,"I have taken 400 pictures with this card using my Nikon D70 and it has performed well. No lag, can keep up with the camera... Overall very happy. Though I bought it right before a significant price drop! Oh well..."
5,What can I say? It works.,"I have several other SanDisk Ultra II cards (both SD and Compact Flash) and have been happy with them all. All have been reliable, fast, and endurant. This card works with my Rebel XT, so I am very happy to be able to have additional storage (upgrading from 1.0GB).Before purchasing any multi-GB storage card, make sure your device will support the size you are buying. Many devices cannot use cards larger than 2GB (some support even less)."
4,Good but could be better..,Overall this is issueless but I feel it could have been a little faster..Sometimes it takes a while before images are written onto it or retrieved from it..On the whole above average..
4,High quality product !,"This 2 Gb CF card is really a fast and reliable one !High quality from SanDisk !You usually don't get a second chance for a good picture!Don't sacrifice your effort with a cheap memory card, buy the right one !"
1,Does not work properly,This card does not work properly using the Minolta DiMAGE 7 & Apple iMac.Some photos cannot be 'imported' because the card 'improperly ejects' itself.Returning card.
5,good memory for the price,"I love the 2G card. I need a lot of memory when I take my camera out. I shoot a lot of pictures, and I cant always get back to my computer to download right away. With the settings I use on my 8 mp camera, I can usual;ly get over 500 pictures per card, and I now carry 3."
5,great product,i prefer San disk to other memory cards. very dependable..use them in all three of my cameras.
5,Excellent on all accounts,San Disk products always perform beyond expectations. And receiving them ahead of the scheduled arrival was an even biggerPLUS in my opinion.
3,Recently failed,"My SanDisk Ultra II 2.0 GB Compact Flash card recently failed after using it for 2+ years. I'm now ""negotiating"" with SanDisk Customer Service (in India) for replacement. Although it has a lifetime warranty you still have to jump through a bunch of hoops. IMHO I believe SanDisk is hoping you'll finally give up. I have a spare CF card so I'm in no rush and don't mind following though until I obtain a replacement. First card that's ever failed me though (but I have had thumb drives fail). Luckily, I only lost my most recent job and it was easy to re-shoot--only lost time."
5,Very good and reliable,I have several of these that I've been using for several years in my Canon 30D. They work great and are very reliable. I've used other sandisk cards as well and have never had a problem with any of them. They make a good product
5,Memory card for Canon,"If you need the memory, and this fits your equipment, then buy it... No problems till date... Heavy use for over two months... no issues, no regrets."
4,Mediocore speed,"I have used this card a ton of times without a problem. It does what it's supposed to do and I appreciate that. I would buy this item again. See my review for the Extreme III, I would not recommend this card for an SLR camera, it's too slow. I can't change my star rating, but I can update this part, so I am. There is a major speed difference between this card and the Extreme III."
5,San Disk,I received this item for use in a new digital SLR 8.3mgpxl camera. It is fast and stores excellent pictures.
4,High capacity; Fast enough; Good value for money,I recommend this item to have the optimal blend of features and cost from an advanced non-professional user perspective.
4,My favorite Kim Mitchell solo release,"I would rate this as Kim's all-around best post-Max Webster album. His others each have several outstanding songs, but this is the only one that's great from start to finish. (Actually his self-titled EP with ""Tennessee Water,"" ""Kids In Action,"" and ""Chain Of Events"" on it is his best solo work, but that's not a full-length album.) I hope he does a concert video and/or music vid compilation tape sometime - or maybe a Max concert video, for old time's sake..."
2,A Time to Be Born,boring--I thought there would be more description of the times. I did not like the characters regardless of whether they were decent or 'bad' people.
3,Celebrity that didn't hold up.,"This is a novel based upon Claire Luce, famed society figure and writer. At the time it was written, the Luce's were celebrities in the New York second world war era art/news world. The novel is a tale of middling plot, a poor girl adventuress, her even more [pitiful] friend and some basic cheaten heart adultery. Nothing in it is particularly involving, and though the characters may be quite accurately Luce, the Luce's have faded and the characters don't seem to live up to the intensity or interest worth a novel.I am still waiting to read a Dawn Powell novel as fantastic as The Wicked Pavillion, and intend to keep hunting, for that novel was brilliant. I regret, this one, did not come close to the odd balls I had so enjoyed there. Still, Powell is a phenomenon that for me at least, is recent, and I hope will come through again as I go about reading her."

5,one of the best goldsmith scores ever,"The score of the fisrt great train robbery is one most exciting, humurous and melodical ones I`ve ever heard. Every single cue is funny to hear and not boring at all. I`m very sad, that this cd hasn`t been re-released yet for nearly 10 years. That`s a pity !!!!!"
4,This is one of lagwagon's best!,"Trashed is a great punk album, if ur a like real punk get these guys. they make good tunes to get u fired up.I rate the songs out of 5:Island of shame-3Lazy-3know it all-4.5stokin'the neighbors-4give it back-4rust-4goin' south-3dis'cords-3.5coffee and cigarettes-4.5brown eyed girl-4 ( a good cover)whipping boy-4no one-4bye for now-3.5this is a lagwagon must have! if u don't have it you betta have DP!"
5,....pretty awesome dawgs!,this album is probably the greatest .....of lagwagon.....joey cape sings kinda cool and a bunch of funny stuff you know?....I liked a lot lazy....and fat mike's apperance in this album.....that's right this is another great fat wreck's good thing....so buy it now pendejo!
3,"not too bad, overall...","although Lagwagon shares alot of similarities with other pop punk bands (weirdly synthed backup harmonies, crappy cover songs, big shorts, etc.), they dish out some clever and catchy upbeat songs that have some charm. they take their melodic cue from seminal bands like The Descendents and come across sounding more like contemporaries like Bracket rather than NOFX. they certainly seem more inclined to the pop spectrum of songwriting rather than the punk. but the covers of ""Brown Eyed Girl"" and the hidden track (which seems to be some kind of misguided tribute to LL Cool J) are just unforgiveable."
2,Trash(ed),"I am a fan of Lagwagon but this is the only release by the band that i cant get into no matter how hard i try the only tracks i really like are know it all, coffee and cigarettes, bye for now, mamma said knock you out and stokin the neighbours. Alot of Lagwagon fans rank this as there best release but i would put leftovers, duh and blaze up there. I tried to get into this album but even after owning it for about 4 years i still dont like it."
2,Trash(ed),"Though this is many peoples favourite Lagwagon record it's never grown on me in the four years i have owned it. The only tracks i really like are know it all, stokin the neighbours, coffee and cigarettes and bye for now the rest just seems to get boring and old really fast, most punk fans would probably love this cd having said that a few wont like it and would go for the more melodic Lagwagon material. Trashed has some really bad songs on it such as goin south and lazy where as the previous release Duh just ran through smoothly and had mainly great tracks throughout. I can see why Trashed appeals to alot of lagwagon fans though i just could'nt get into it."
1,Never buy a game without playing the demo first!!,"I had my doubts about buying a game whose MSRP dropped from $50 to $20 vitually overnight. Unfortunately, I bought it anyway assuming since the earlier games were so much fun this one must be too. I've played bad games before but this time I really feel like I was had.Zero stars."
3,Classic game,"I loved the first and second game and had to try the third series of this game, it was worth it"
2,Not a Good Game,Vastly inferior to Lords of the Realm 1 & 2. I was truly disappointed by how much they dumbed the game down. Do yourself a favor. Lords of the Realm 1 & 2 are a 5 dollar bundle on GOG.com. Grab it instead.
1,Poor Performances on Lord of the Realm 3,"I am a huge fan of Lord of The Realm 2. However, I was really disappointed when I bought this game expecting it to be more fun or at least equal to the second game. This is animated and nothing compared to what you experience with the second. This game never should have been made because now I have lost all interest in this game and all the others similiar to it. Poor graphics and not able to build up your city very easy. This reminds me of a childs game. I'm 26 and I still love a few games but this was way too far. Poor, Poor, Poor performances."
3,Definitely *not* LotR 2,"I would not recommend this game for people who are looking for an updated version of LotR 2; LotR 3 is a *very* different game, with real-time campaign maps as well as RT battle maps, and a completely different ""economy"". Whilst the graphics are very polished, and the mechanics are novel, it's important to approach this game as a new experience, and not a new version of the mechanics of LotR 2.Since I was looking for a new LotR 2, I did not play LotR 3 for very long, but it seemed to me that the RT battles ran too slowly for my liking. I would recommend you try a demo before you buy."
2,Lord of the Realm 3,"This appears to be a great game, but it is not what the cover leads you to believe. The game is centered around battles, and has very little if anything to do with building castles. In fact, the castles on the map are all generic and the ones you build will not even be seen unless they are attacked and you enter the battle.This game is also very slow moving."
2,This game is just confusing,"Okay, so I'm being really nice giving this game 2 stars. I am a huge fan of Lords of the Realm II so I thought I would purchase this game and have a go at it. Well.....that didn't go to well. The game, although it has great graphics, is extrememly confusing and hard to follow on what you can and can't do. It is really different from the previous Lords of the Realms and thus makes it hard to play. I wouldn't suggest not buying this product, but if you are a huge Lords of the Realm II fan, then I would say advise you not to. You will most likely end up being upset with yourself (and your computer!!)."
1,Disappointing,"I was a big fan of the Lord of the Realms series and was looking forward to part 3. However this game is terrible, it takes all of the previous fun game playing elements out of the game. There is no real decision making. I don't know how the developers can justify the time they spent on the game, there just isn't any gameplay worth talking about, what happened to quality control????"
2,My Dust Collection,"Realm 3 is an average game at best. Although ther is more interactive options and a much better 3D engine to this game, I have apparently become bored with it quickly, after finishing the tutorial and beginning play, it is already sitting in it's jewel case collecting dust with the rest of my ""average"" games. I've found myself playing Realm 2 more than this game.The setup is there, and the competetive spirit is there, but there is little challenge except in combat. I prefer a game more based on Realm 2, where you have to battle not only human-to-human elements but elements more inclined with proper farming, mining, and such. The simplified task of assigning Nights or Peasants as one singular town gives no strategy outside the realm of battle. Strategy should be included in all aspects across the board, not just in combat.Something tells me with this mediocre follow-up, we won't be seeing Lords 4 anytime soon, if at all."
1,RUN AWAY RUN AWAY!!!,Perhaps they should have built a rather large badger. This is a huge disappointment and the original version was way way way better than this. You have amazingly little control and there is amazingly little strategy for a strategy game. Get Medieval Total War if youre looking for Dark Ages fun. I miss my $20.
1,Don't Listen to That Guy from Notre Dame!,"HAS TO BE ONE OF THE WORST GAMES OF THE YEAR!!Lords III is a total goatrope- that guy who reviewed it fromNotre Dame had no idea what he was talking about. Merchantshave nothing to do with anything. You are not a vassal,the vassals are the parade of idiots you're given to leadyour armies. Allowing the rest of your nation to go intothe crapper for the joy of actually getting to run one ofyour own battles was a ridiculous concept that should havebeen left on the cutting room floor.Well- now we know why this POS was delayed for so long-because THEY HAD NO IDEA WHAT TO DO.. and never figured it out!Ever heard of ""All things come to those who wait..""?Well, keep waiting and save yourself the money.When the UPS guy came to my house to drop this piece of junk offI should have sent him packing with it back to Amazon.LOR II- Awesome! Lords of Magic- playable, even fun.LOR III? Honestly- don't even bother.."
1,They gutted it. . . .,"As reflected in other reviews here, Sierra took out all the best parts of this series: managing the economy, delicate balancing of army, and even basic interaction with your cities. They took out the castle choices and the cool little videos. Even though the battle graphics were pretty basic in the prior games, it was unquestionably more engaging than the 3-D graphics but dull and incomprehensible battles in this game. In addition to the inability to control individual troops, I have had fighters attacking the air and other clipping issues.This game is simply not fun, and made me want to fire up Lords II to remember what this series used to be about.Get Stronghold or Lords II for a much better game."
1,Newer not always is better,"I bought this game one month ago, together with ""American Conquest Fight Back"", if I liked the last one as top of the bunch, LOTR III is bottom.I'll try to sell my copy, and desperately look for an used copy of the first version."
1,Huge dissapointment,"I just have to mirror the other recent posters here...I was very excited to get my hands on this game being a fan of the first 2 LOTR titles. Everything that made the earlier games fun just isn't found in this game and what you end up with is a second rate real time strategy game that has poor UI, difficult control and just plain boring gameplay.Sierra knew they had a stinker on their hands and slashed the price in half to try to dupe you into still buying it. Don't let them get away with it. I wouldn't play this game even if it were free."
1,This is just the demo right? Right?!,"It's a trick, get an axe! I just bought it. Save yourself the heart-ache. Sierra is obviously having some problems, and this is not pretty. Just say, ""No."" Don't make me say I told you so. Buy StarCraft by the same company. Buy Lords of the Realm I, II, or the Siege Pack. Try HomeWorld. They didn't finish this game and released it anyway. It is so bad, you'll just about cry. Hint: If it was 1987, I'd give it a 4. And, I'm not just writing for fans of first person shooters. Oh, those people will climb the walls. RTS people won't like this either."
2,You've got to wonder..,"You've got to wonder about any game that has been in development in since late 2001 and does not get released until March 2004. You've also have to be concerned about the fact that its release date was constantly pushed back and that its price fell from $49.99 to $19.99. Finally, why is this game being released so quietly and with so little fanfare. The official webpage is eeriely silent and more omniously a patch was released even before the game shipped.These are troubling questions and lead to the ultimate question: what is wrong with this game? I am going to wait until I read some reviews by non-fanboy reviewers before I consider purchasing. (A fanboy is someone who spends his time on the official webpage, salivating at every nugget of info dropped to him by the developers, and is so blinded in his loyalty to the product that he ignores glaring problems. A fanboy is also someone who writes glowing five star reviews on Amazon.com for a game that he has not played yet.)"
1,1 Twisted piece of crap,ok first reason this sux is vassals those mental servents mess you up 2cd The terrible graphics 3rd is *FRAME BY FRAME MOVEMENT* i mean it i even have 546 mb of ram and you control units in companies not singely and every time a guy dies you get weaker abd weaker then when like 10 die(if you even get that many to control)your whole army flees there are no huge clashes if you want this then just get lords 2 or 1 they are much better also i threw this in my trash 3 hourse after i got it
1,Buyer beware!,"If you loved playing LOTR2, than stay away from this one. All the best elements are gone, all you can do is appoint people to oversee your lands and than sit back and watch your armies move slowly across the map. Gets pretty boring after 10 minutes. I am taking this sorry excuse for a game back to the store. Worst 20 dollars i have ever spent!"
1,"Looks cool, no fun to play","The A.I. vassels removed what I liked about LOTR II. Also, every time I start the game it takes over 5 minutes to get to main menu because it says it is optimizing all of these maps. I have plenty of disk space and did a full install, all this stuff should already be ready to go on my hard drive . . .right ? ? ? I liked the turn based of II also. Real time doesn't allow me to review my empire and actually make STRATEGIC decisions ! ! The graphics are good, sound also. Can't command a single soldier, the whole company goes apparently. I think I enjoyed the more specific, hands-on county controlling, cows, grain, weapons, rock, wood etc. and warfare of LOTR II. These days, getting $$ back for these games is impossible. I ignored bad reviews thinking that they couldn't possibly be right, since LOTR II was so cool (IMHO)."
1,I WANT MY MONEY BACK,This is one of the worst games to come out in the last 2 years. [...] for trying to keep Vivendi afloat while they went bankrupt. This kind of crap reminds me of the old DOS games but in color.
1,This game is horrible,"After waiting forever for the release and then for it to be delivered to the store, I eagerly installed it on my computer. This game is a high graphic shadow of LOTR II! You have very little input into what is going on. You sit around doing nothing for long periods of time and when you do get into battle, control is very bad. The castle building interface is laughable. I don't know how Sierra did it after having sooo long to develop this game, but the sucked all the fun out of LOTR! And beware, it has crashed on my twice, and I have XP Professional!!"
1,Lords of the Realm 3 (the Travesty),"Those of you that were waiting for this title to be released because of your enjoyment of the previous versions do not bother buying this title. They changed the format to a continous real-time-strategy (and strategy is used very losely here) game. The game play is nothing like the previous games. Limited army creation, no manipulation of serfs to ensure the best allocations of production. You only need gold, which is constantly stolen, to create castles. To be honest I am finding this title very boring and if I had spent more than the $20.00 I would be very upset. ""Lords of the Realm"" should have never been in this title! It is very misleading because the great game play features of the previous title are lacking. It even flounders as a RTS!"
1,Ha! And this game was 4 years in the making! LMAO!,"I was happy to see LORII was being made when it was first announced way back in 2001. As soon as I heard the developers were going to defect to the RTS craze, I knew it was a lost cause. There has been more RTS crap churned out than ever before..RTS SUCKS because you don't have time to strategize. It's the same old boring repetitive crap. Yet developers keep making the same garbage.LORIII was supposed to be realized in christmas of 2002, then spring 2003, then winter 2003, ugg, I can't remember how many times it was delayed. You can tell the project must have been in total chaos.Word to the game developers...try making a game that actually requires thought and strategy."
2,"So close, yet So far...","This game had so much promise, but they let took it completely to the other end of the spectrum, instead of the micromanaging wich could get time consuming on LOTR2. LOTR3 swings the other way so completely you cannot even decide what type of Army you want.Types of troops you raise are completely dependant on the lords you install in your land parcels. Not bad If I had an inexhaustible supply of each type to decide what I wanted. Nope, you have what the game gives you and thats it. Worse you couldn't micromanage things even if you wanted to. Then they fubared the combat, whatever you do don't attack a castle, the enemy's troops will hide out on the walkway behind the walls while your troops will mill around in the bottom of the courtyard getting shot full of arrows.If you like simplistic games this would be the one for you. The only effective gameplay decisions you will ever make are which lord do I install, where should my next army come from and who do I invade next?"
1,Disappointment,"Well to start, I should have listened to the reviews. I read the negative reviews and thought that they could not be accurate. As a big fan of Lords 2 I felt that Lords 3 would be at least as good. Well I was totaly wrong. This game is a total disappointment. The only action is in choosing vasels to run your realm. Well as in Lords 2 I enjoyed runing all aspects. What made Lords 2 a great game were many little fun things to do such as choosing which weapons the blacksmith would produce, choosing what to put on which field, coming up with battle strategies and repairing damaged castles. Lords 3 has none of this. I say to Sierra shame on you, and I will think long and hard before buying a Sierra game again. You should save face and refund the fans money. To the game producers go play Lords 2 and see how you ruined such a good title. To the fans, do what I did not do and trust the reviews."
1,Not nearly as good as the second one!,"This is unbelievable. All the great things about the Lords of the Realm II have been removed and nothing good has been added. Gone is the management of the territory resources, instead you simply assign a vassal to an area and they produce just one type of resources. To make matters worse, you armies are produced automatically so you dont even get to choose your army types. The battles start automatically but you are not even taken to the battlefield automatically so you can ened up missing the battle if you dont go there right away. I read the other reviews but I thought the sencond one was such fun I should give this one a try. Big mistake save your money."
3,Hope springs....,"Like others who have written, I'm a big fan of Lords2 and eagerly await the sequel. But I am NOT pleased to see it as RTS. Not only that, but I was a big fan of Master of Orion 2 and eagerly awaited a much delayed sequel. What a dissapointment!!!! So I will reserve judgement and read reviews here and elsewhere before I rush out and buy. I hope for much but am prepared for a big letdown."
3,Just a thought,"I am really looking forward to this game (Huge fan of the Lord of the Realms II) and I think that with these changes it might even improve a great bit on the first two. But lets not make our judgments on the game when it hasn't come out yet. I was reading other reviews where people had already decided not to buy the game just because it had been delayed(admittedly a very long time) but its a game folks, if it had been released earlier we all would have been very disapointed. Atleast this way although I had to wait for the game, I can feel pretty confidant that Impressions is just trying to make sure they release a good game."
3,"WOW, 5 out of 5 stars! Golly...","How does a game get 5 out of 5 stars even before it's released? Someone, please give me a clue!I'm a HUGE fan of LOTR2 and am eagerly awaiting this release. However, I'm bitterly disappointed that the turn-based/RTS dual mode of LOTR2 is being abandoned in favor of full RTS. My concern is that the game might degenerate into a tiresome click-fest.Let's just restrain our enthusiasm until this title is released and all the fixes are available.Thanks."
1,I've had it with them,"That's right, I am sick and tired of getting a little excited about the game release and now it was pushed back until 2004!! While I am a hugh LOR2 fan (...). (...) have let me down for the final time."
3,Disappointed but hopeful,"I have read several of the reviews on this sight and must agree that it is disappointing when a game is delayed. I enjoyed Lords II but found it lacking in both depth and replayability. I was delighted to here that Lords III had much more depth of play and a more refined story line. It is unfortunate that the game was delayed. I have been waiting for the sequel for years now so, no one is more disappointed than I am. But, we must realize that very sofisticated and detailed games sometimes have setbacks. We can only hope that this setback will produce a better product...with excellent playability and free of bugs. However, I remain sceptical. The studio had better put out an exceptional product...BUG FREE...to justify such a delay. I gave the game Three stars only because I cannot rate a game based on a one minute trailer."
3,dont juge it,every body is talking about this game like trash. i would buy the game anyway to see if it fits ur taste. people who hate htis game might hate other games that you like you never know. it is cheep enogh to try and not like it. so y not.
4,Hopeful with concerns.,"I usually buy about two video games a year for my PC. I have to say Lords of the Realm II is still my favorite (I bought it in 1997). I only had two problems: one, it was too easy because the computer opponents did not fight very hard; and two, the graphics and storyline were not that interesting. I hope Lords III deals with these issues instead of revamping the entire game, or creating junk like Lords of Magic."
3,mediocre,"Hey, for $20 what do you expect? The game is OK, but not great. I liked the graphics and the GUI, and the game is still fun to play. I have 2 problems with it, though. Firstly, they took out too much of the management side of the game - this version is really all about the warfare side of the game. Secondly, it crashes my system constantly. Very buggy."
3,"Tjaka, South Africa","This review is meant for the developers of this game and shall not be of much use to somebody who doesn't know this game.***The idea of real time on different levels (strategy & battle) is interesting but I find it a step in the wrong direction. Too many things happen too fast and one cannot make proper decisions. For instance - there's not enough time to properly look through the different vassals before assigning them - you have to grab & assign because somewhere else your attention is also needed. Often you miss out on nice battles because you have to attend to other matters. I still prefer the turn-based system. ***Many improvements are needed in the gameplay - I'm not going to try to list all the frustrations. If you're used to playing ""Total War"" then ""Lords of the Realm"" is a frustration. ***It sound as if I threw my ""Lords of the Realm III"" cd in the dustbin? No, I'm enjoying it. But I hope there shall be substantial improvements in the add-on or ""Lords of the Realm IV""."
2,Unfortunately not what I expected,"Of course being a LOTR II fan, I had high hopes for this game. After a few hours of play and being really bored, I thought to myself, ""maybe I just don't know how to play this game yet."" Don't bother reading the manual, it doesn't help at all, it just gives a real vague overview of the game.Now after reading other's reviews I know I wasn't alone in being rather unexcited about this game. I give it two stars because I like the battle scenes a lot more than in the first game. But that is it. It's true that the land management being gone makes this game a lot more boring. It just feels like the player places their vassals and occasionally fight some battles with armies moving slower than molasses and spends a lot of time just waiting. Don't bother with this one."
1,Terrible Gameplay,"Being a huge fan of Lords of the Realm 2, I had high expectations for Lords 3. After playing it, the $20 price tag makes sense. In my opinion, the game is horrible. They've taken all of the best aspects from Lords of the Realm 2, removed them, and fixed up the graphics a bit (which aren't too impressive). Most the economical aspects of Lords 2 have been destroyed, and the battles are fairly boring and somewhat buggy. After waiting for a long time for this release I'm extremely dissapointed. If I could return this game for half the cost I payed for it I would."
1,nothing like lords 2 do not buy,they completely changed the intereface and the whole game in general. One of the worst sequels ever
1,Please Read the Reviews,"OK!!! Here we go i loved lotr2 great game and like everyone else has stated, this is nothing like lotr2. This triology should never have existed. They should have stopped at 2. I really am not going to get into the game and its details very much because it has been talked about over and over again by others. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!! That is all i have to say. I paid $8 on amazon for this and I would have rather thrown that $8 in the fire."
1,One of the worst games I ever played!,"Lord of the Realm I and II kick ass compared to this game. I couldn't even get into it. I gave it a chance because I waited so long for this release. If this was any other games I would of dropped it in the first 15 minutes. Luckily, I didn't pay for it and tested it out first. I knew something was up when it dropped from $50 to $20 and was delayed for years. Do not buy! total rip off! I could make a game better than this."
3,"McGavin should be strangled, his rendition is just horrid.","The narration by Darren McGavin was by far one of the worst renderings I have ever, in my life, listened too. His attempt to impersonate women's voices, tall men's voices, old men's, young boys, whatever, is pitiful. He took all the interest and mystery away. I wanted to feel the tension of the words, enjoy the lovers bantering, close my eyes and see the horizon. Darren spoiled every single part of the book for me. I will not buy you again because they are all read by this nincompoop. This actor who reads as though it were a very humerous story and one only he understands. Get rid of him!"
4,An excellent coffee table book.,"Sun Signs for Writers is fun and colorful. I think this book would come in handy for any writer, whether they believe in astrology or not. The author, Bev Walton-Porter is excellent in knowing the different signs to write various personalities within it. I can't wait to show my friends and family!"
1,Broken Already,"I've had this product for less than a month, almost three weeks to be exact and it's already broken. I like to talk on my phone whenever I want to, which includes when it's charging. The stress on the rubber pulled the covering of the wires off at the plug and at the charger's base, and eventually pulled the wires out enough so that the it no longer charges. To me, althugh some may think the extra stress on the product should be applied, the product is ridiculous. The other charger's I've bought have lasted till now, and I've had them for close to nine months. Also, the cord is no where near long. That is annoying."
1,Charger did not work.,The charger did not work as advertised. It failed to provide enough power to even make calls when plugged in. Complete write-off.
1,Wont charge!!!!!!,"I ordered this charger on 4/30, which was a month and a week ago. Then a few days ago it died on me, and I have not been able to use it . I guess I got what i paid for."
2,Get a ball instead,"I wasn't quite sure what I was buying based on the photo here, but this is basically a ring with a center spoke out of the central hub that makes the pet run around in circles around the spoke. Doesn't really attach very securely to the cage either at the top or on the side as it is very heavy, so I'm nervous about using this as a cage attachment.As a standalone toy, it seems kind of pointless- just get a hamster ball, those are cheaper, easier to clean, and allows for actual wandering around."
1,No way to clean,"I do not recommend this accessory for two reasons. First, the only place this opens is the lid in the center part. If your pet poops/pees in the outer tubes, there is no way to clean it, except to shake whatever you can out. This has quickly become a cesspool on our cage. Yuck. Second, you can't get your pet out when it is hiding in those outer tubes. So, my son can't play with his pets. I'm tossing this."
2,"Neat idea, impossible to clean","It's a neat idea, but this thing is impossible to clean. You simply can't take it apart without breaking it, and you can't clean properly without taking it apart. Look for another option."
2,"hamster loves it, but difficult to clean","We got this to add to uor extensive collection of tubes and housing for our beloved ""Fergie"". She loved this turn-about too much. She made house in it and it does not come apart easily (to say the least) There is an opening for the middle section but very hard to open the tubes in order to clean them. Because of the difficulty to clean, it had to go."
4,good buy,"this is now a new little hang out area for our mice, they love settin up their beds in there. i was worried about it being too heavy to be up high, but we now have it at the top of our crazy jumble of pipes and it hasn't once fallen off, great buy, and looks good too."
5,Murder's Row,A classic Matt Helm book. This is a great story in the classic genre. It is simple to read and will keep you wanting more.
2,Frustrating disappointment,"I was hopeful when I found this keyboard on the net that it would fulfill my needs and was so relieved to have been able to locate a kb with touchpad integrated that I bought two, one for each of the computers I owned. Big mistake. Neither one has lasted longer than a year. Don't mistake the shape to indicate this keyboard is ergonomic, either, since it's flat and just as uncomfortable to use as a regular keyboard. It takes alot of pressure to make the keys register and overall it has made my wrist and hand pain worse, not better. I'm giving it 2 stars because it is lighter than the old PC Concepts touchpad kb I was using, and it's black to match my computer, but that's about the only things it has going for it."
1,EUREKA SEASON 4.0??????,They left out several season [4] episodes. There was no writers strike making it necessary to include half of the episodes this time. Whoever thought that that the CUSTOMERS would tolerate this sure SHOT [himself or herself] in the foot. I won't be buying any more EUREKA CDs!
1,only 5 EPISODES !,I pre-paid to get a good price. I paid over $38.00. NOW it's selling for $19. That's because there are only 5 episodes.
3,Losing some steam?? Hmmm.....,"Not to be a naysayer or anything like that, but this episode felt a little sluggish to me. With the announcement last week of the show getting cancelled, I was pissed and shaking my head over another great Syfy show getting the axe. But now, I don't know---this episode made me feel like the show has pretty much run its course, even though I truly love the characters. Five seasons for ANY show is substantial, so hopefully Eureka will go out on a VERY satisfying high note. >:)"
3,The .0 means its a half season,Sy Fy loves to do this with all their shows. This will be no different. It's a half of the season. 4.5 will come out later. Anytime you see a .0 on a season it's split in half.
1,What the heck,"uMy family loved Eureka, we watched it every night. Then along comes season four, season for has a new writer. No longer is it children friendly and quite frankly I found it cheap and corny. All of the charictures talk and act like they are four year-olds. That old laughy Eureka spirit is gone. The new writer should just stop, bring back the old.Love the show up until season four."
5,Great,I love love love this show!! The characters are really funny and easy to relate certain ones to yourself and your family members.
5,Great show,Eureka is a wacky show for the science fiction buff. It is fun to watch. I have all the seasons.
4,Eureka - 4.0,"Love this show. Great casting, consistently good plots. What bugs me is the splitting the release season in half & charging full price for each half. I still purchased 3.5 & 4.0, but really am not sure I'll continue buying into that scheme in the future. Maybe Netflixing will be the way to go for me."
2,the Christmas episode,"When I ordered I thot the Ad said the Christmas episode would be included - same on Wharehouse 13 - But neither one is included nor can I find this episode as a single DVD in shopping-what happened.? I agree with not finding the menu friendly or more extras or that the price started high and is now much less with much less..the first seasons dvds were the best..The other lost scene is the cast singing an ad for the 2nd season - really great but they don't include in the dvd set. I'm addicted and hope the writers keep up the brilliant ideas, just let us be able to watch all you put on SYFY in the first place."
2,Feel cheated,While I love Eureka and was happy with what I saw I feel very cheated that I only received 1/2 a season. Not only that but I can't even find 4.5 for sale!
2,Time travel killed Eureka,"In season 4, the central cast members travel back and forth in time to return to a Eureka that has been altered due to their time travel. The characters have to figure out what has changed while at the same time trying to function in their new lives. It's obvious that the producers of the show used this time travel twist to re-envision the characters and breathe fresh life into the show. Instead, they ensured the show's demise. The time travel twist is just plain lazy, and week after week it is increasingly irritating to watch each character have to figure out what has changed from their original past. After the viewers invested three seasons in learning and loving the characters and the town, the show's producers give the fans the middle finger with a stupid time travel twist. The show easily gets 4-5 stars for the first three seasons. However, it is generous to give season 4 even two stars."
5,One of my favorite Christmas shows :),GREAT!! They did a phenomenal job with this. It was like reliving my childhood Saturday mornings. I miss Eureka so much :/
5,Splendid Series,"The writers and actors all did a great job putting together some wonderful escapism entertainment. There was enough ""humanity"" without becoming brooding, and it always had a touch of humor. The human interest aspects of the plot were intriguing and believeable. The audience was easily drawn into the friendships, loyalties and romances. A good watch."
3,Partial season received,"I saw the DVD & thought GREAT the season that I missed, YAY. Buy it, get it & HUH? @ NO point in this description do they mention that you are getting 1/2 of the season; movie DVD's use a .5 when they add extra/bonus features so I thought calling it 4.0 was odd, but didn't make the psychic jump to missing part of the show. I really like the show but don't have Scyfy channel anymore, so I didn't realize it was on air again until about 2 months ago. So I missed the whole thing, I've gone online & could only find the last 5 episodes online to watch without paying a per-episode fee. I could have dealt with missing the Christmass episode, didn't see it the 1st time after all; but I'm missing about 9 shows here!"
1,ridiculous..,"I had planned to order the entire eureka series, but cancelled the while thing. I refuse to support the 1/2 season scheme. Will wait until the complete collection or will just watch on-line."
5,Eureka!!,Same old Eureka with a twist!! I was a bit leary with the time travel aspect at first but they have melded the story so well.....LOVE IT!!
1,Eureka Season 4 DVD Complaint,"When I purchased this DVD I understood that this was Season 4 - complete. Nowhere did I see a Season 4.5. But even putting that aside, the DVD I purchased only has six episodes and two of those are the same episode with one being expanded. Twenty dollars for a DVD that was sold as ""Season 4,"" and it is missing episodes #3 and #4 -- I had to purchase them on iTunes. No where in your ad does it say it is missing episodes. Had I known, I would have purchased the entire season from iTunes. I am extremely disappointed in this purchase. I have never had to say that in the past over any Amazon purchase."
5,Eureka - Super Special Show,"I have loved this show since its first showing. I think the writers (and actors) are terrific. Season 4 has been a great way to creatively ""shake things up"". I look forward to season 5 and season 6 and season 7 and.... (and I'll buy them all)."
3,Weird and Inexplicable Ending,"The ending made no sense. Jo had ample opportunity to shoot at the helicopter and in fact shoot it down. She did nothing. W T F? Inexplicable and made no sense.I can see wanting to consider the story line but the ending leaves a bad taste. After all, the important thing wasn't Allison being absolutely OK, but saving what they got.Eh!Disappointing. Otherwise, good episode."
3,An advertisement disguised as a show...,"This clip is an advertisement for the show. It's cute and it's free, so it's not bad. I prefer real episodes..."
1,"""Jumping the shark"" is an understatement.","Good gawd! This episode was simply AWFUL. I really do love this show but the writers have seriously driven this clever show off a steep cliff! Makes me wonder if JJ Abrams was secretly writing the last four episodes since that's when, in my humble opinion, the writing started to painfully suffer and spiral. What happened??! Oh well, EUREKA has indeed finally run its course. I will miss Carter, Allison, Joe, Henry, Fargo and the rest of the gang. Sad to see this show go out on such a poorly written sour note."
4,"Great job, Salli!","This was a great ep all the way through---with the camera angles, suspense, and everything else that make Eureka episodes just so incredibly entertaining to watch.Salli Richardson-Whitfield makes her directorial debut with ""Omega Girls"" and she did a fantastic job! I love the scene slices between Allison and Beverly. Cleverly executed. This ep once again showcased the acting chops of Erica Cerra and Jordan Hinson. I loved the teamwork they showed and how everything came together at the end. Love this show!"
4,where are the missing episodes,"i love the series but where are episodes 4 and 5 I only have 1 and 2 which is a longer episode of 1 and then 3 and then 6,7,8. so where are 4and 5. how can I review it when its not complete.did I pay for episodes 4and 5?"
5,Getting better,"As SciFi shows go, Eureka can't be set apart the way you might Farscape or Battlestar Galactica, but for what it is, this is a 5-star show. And what it is, is a genuine, funny story about people in a town that you both care about and root for as they work through a new dilemma together each week. The characters are such that you care about their story-lines, the humor is a perfect fit for their experiences and the writing is creative. As I said, this show can't be considered to be as compelling as other elite SciFi shows, but I look forward to seeing it each week just as much. Season 4 has provided a nice change-of-direction for the show."
1,eureka season 4.0,"I was very dissapointed in this product. I love the show Eureka, but when I received the series, it only contained 2 discs, with 3 missing episodes in the middle. I tried to contact amazon to get the problem resolved and got nowhere. The series has episodes 1, 2, 3, missing 4, 5, 6, and has 7 and 8. I wish I would have known and I would not have purchased this product. I feel like I just wasted 20 bucks. I sincerely hope that Amazon looks into the problem, I am sure I am not the only one who received a faulty set."
5,Together At Last,I enjoyed this episode because two of my favorite character stop running and confronted their love for each other. I'm looking forward to the next season to see their relationship grow stronger and other character developments.
3,Worm holes please,"A worm hole should swallow up this entire altered reality and put Eureka back to the way it was.The smoker dude should've died. If Allison dates or kisses that dude I will never watch this show again.Henry should tell his ""wife"" what really happened. The writer's have gone too far with the altered realities.But that's just me..."
3,Huh?,Normally I love this show. But WHY wouldn't Jo shoot at the helicopter???? The head of GD security let a chopper go away without even a shot! That doesn't fit Jo's character at all. I'm rather disappointed. Everything else was good though.
3,It has it's moments,"My wife and I are big fans of Eureka. We started watching at the beginning. Since then we have acquired each season of the series on DVD to watch at our leisure. She and I were a bit disappointed with season 4.0. It's an alright season. The plot is a little strange. All-in-all, the season had it's moments. Ultimately it was decided that this season should be added to the library."
5,Fantastic series - keep the seasons coming!,"We've bought every season so far, and can't wait for the next installment.Eureka is witty, smart, and well-acted.Occasionally there is a sloppy edit, but that is about the only criticism I have. It's one of the very few series that my wife and I BOTH enjoy.Well, I DO have one more criticism:WHY do they now insist that we buy ""Half"" seasons, rather than full seasons? Seems to be an easy way to make a couple more bucks from the fans, unfortunately.Regardless, we like it too much not to buy it."
5,"Eureka such a fantastic show, do not cancel!","I was a late-comer to this show, but caught up fast and am now real-time. I'm excited to learn how the characters develop and get in new trouble. But, to my surprise, I hear this popular show has been cancelled (season 5 is written and will be produced). Now, this isn't some show that tanked and the network is putting it out of its misery. Eureka is a very successful show that is getting the ax because of budgeting (special effects are too expensive? yeah, keep Warehouse13, that makes sense).I hope they come to their senses, scrap the final episode that wraps it all up and continues to develop this great series. I vouch my support by buying episodes here on Amazon because I don't care to subscribe to cable and Syfy's remaining dismal content. EUREKA FTW!"
1,Love Show...HATE this 1/2 season DVD release crap,Love the show and this was a great season of the show......BUT I hate this new fad where they only come out with 1/2 the season making me buy 2 volumes for 1 season.
5,The photocards made each student a person.,"The book has useful information about the realities of disability, the prevailing attitudes, the causes of disability, family issues, and special services for special students. The idea of project-based inclusion is new and exciting. It will actually work in any school. Each chapter has an set of photocards that introduce a student with disability. As the cards are viewed by teachers and students they will know the student with a disability as a person, their joys and sorrows. An excellent book that is a joy to read."
1,"Oddly, this seems to lack any spirit at all...","This CD really seems to lack any spirit or soul... I would expect to enjoy these songs if I were in some middle-of-the-road, TGI restaurant that had a band on a Friday night, but not on a CD with the intention of repeated listenings. The elements are all in place as far as instrumentation is concerned, but it just lacks soul. They have picked all of the expected New Orleans songs (Mardi Gras in New Orleans, Iko-Iko, Saints, etc), so don't expect to be surprised in the least."
4,God's Revalation to Laozi,"Only now the 21st century are we finding out how the God of Abraham revealed himself to Laozi. With great intuitive insight, the general revelation of God was perceived by one of China's ancient philosophers. This link between the God of the Bible is now becoming better known. For additional information see http://www.chinasoul.com/e/e-wk.htm. It should be pointed out that this link to Laozi is not a link to what developed later, that is, Daoism. Daoism is actually a distortion of Laozi's thinking. This book does point this out.The reader should know that this book is heavily infused with eastern Christian mysticism and thought. Even so, there are unique insights to the Trinity and to the original state of man."
5,Beyond the mystical by drawing on the particulars of life:,"A search in faith for those who seek their God in the particulars of their life and times. Damascene speaks to those of us who cannot accept religious contentions that require us to assume things that exist outside of these particulars or that operate in a manner seperate from the ways of the present or past as revealed in recorded history, scientific investigation, and common experience. If you find show-offish miracles and that which goes bump in the night to be of no more import to you than tricks of the sleight of hand, you will appreciate this expression of faith."
4,Not the Tao Te Ching,"I had the impression, when I ordered this book, that it was a translation of the Tao Te Ching, with a commentary from a Christian perspective. This was not the correct understanding of this book. Rather this book is a new writing which reflects insights based upon the Tao Te Ching and Orthodox Christianity as it was practiced in China in recent centuries. The book contains a chapter of the history of Orthodox Christianity in China, with short biographies of missionaries and priests, many of whom becames matyrs. It would be inappropriate for one person to offern an opinion on the content of spiritual writing, but perhaps it would be appropriate to report my personal impression that this writing seems to reflect a deeply rooted, authentic spirituality arising in people who were inspired by the Tao and Eastern Orthodox mysticism."
2,A question of historical view,"This is an interesting book if you have an evolutive historical view of cultures believing that they will all culminate in Christ sooner or later. The author presupposes this view. If you don't think that all religions and cultures -specially Taoism- are only a means of reaching Christ, or at least think that this is a matter that requires deeper critical analysis, you won't like the book.strasser@ig.com.br"
1,Book tyring to create more christian myth,"This book is simply trying to create a connection with christian fantasy, which has absolutely no relevance or connection whatsoever to Taoism. Taoist thought is not based on supernatural dieties and hope of groveling to some harsh and mythical judemental diety in order to get accepted into a fictional after-life.. This is another up-chuck for the brainwashed christians, attempting to again absorb a different system that is not based on their biblical mythology. If you are not a born-again zelot, programmed with christian dogma, this book will appear totally ridicules. update: See the movie ""Jesus Camp"" if your interested in actually seeing the mentality of most of the reviewers of this book."
2,Not the best case study book,This book was required for a graduate level medical nutrition therapy class. The different case studies were thorough and had great questions posed for each case. The variety in the cases was good. Some of the questions are irrelevant as MNT guidelines from ADA are better defined.The book has typos and has incorrect abbreviations listed in the back.
4,case studies,I find this book helpful to me as I start learning how to read case studies and decipher them to get all the vital information I need.
4,Corvette: A Buyers Guide,"Given the small size of the book the detail is excellent and accurate. The book was published in black and white (including illustrations) which limited the identification of Corvette models. For example, the corvette Anniversary model in the 1980's has body colored alloys and a different sort of pillar on the door.The book is very useful if you are wanting to purchase a corvette as it has engine numbers, colours and all details from that date so that you know all the real details of the car.Perhaps the next addition will have colored pictures, considering that most aspects of a car are viewed and it is important to identify the subtle details of a vehicle, especially special features (ie. anniversary cars)."
2,"Well, it's melodic...","Actually, if I could give this 2.5 stars, it'd be more acurate. I have to admit that this album is a disappointing listen for me. I went into the album thinking it would be something perhaps a bit more edgy. Instead, though the vocals are strong and the lyrics are intelligent, Karney sounds a bit like something I'd hear at a bar in a small coastal town during spring break. In fact, I mean that in the nicest way. I'm sure they'd be a hoot to see live, what with the horn section and multiple singers. ""Love to Watch"" is a fun, reggae-flavored number that I'm sure would get any crowd moving. Overall, however, it was a bit too safe, and treads on all-too-familiar terrain."
4,"Good, Educational Text Book","I used this text as a supplement in a Native American history course I took in college. A very fair book, by which I mean the author identifies his bias immediately and allows you to have perspective on the opinion sketched through out the book. A great guide to California and Nevada tribes. Fascinating."
3,Anticipating,"I haven't read it yet so I anticipate a new and fresh treatment of the Native California way of life, traditions and motives before the arrival of the first Euro-Strangers. I hope it will present them in a truthful light as they first heard of the strangers, their anticipation of the arrival and, finally, their coping with its reality. I also hope it will clearly state the influx of Mexicans and their part in subjugating the Native Californian population. If I'm lucky it will mention the original name of the land. Looking forward and I will further review after reading it."
5,I BUY IT FOR MY SON,My son play it alot.When my newphew comes he play it to.It a good product to buy for your child.
4,almost never boring,Aoe was my first RTS but this is great ucan play any point in human history that u can think of but it has almost no detail at all in each epoch.best of all it is dirt cheap and EE 2 is coming out this i believe and it has much better graphics
1,THIS GAME IS TERRIBLE,"I played this game once. THEN I SOLD IT. IT KILLS ITSELF because when you put the disk in the computer freezes. My computer never freezes. WHEN IT WORKS IT IS SO EASY. PLAY AGE OF MYTHOLOGY, RISE OF NATIONS, and CIVILIZATION 3 CONQUESTS INSTEAD."
5,Well Satisfied!,"I have loved this game since it was released! It has a really good editor, to. I can use it to build my own worlds and program my civilation with lots of special bonusess, or take out certin abilities or technologies to make it harder, or easier, and it's pretty addictive to me. I've played it so much I've had to replace it several different times because I wore out the Disks! I'm still playing it since the release, which I waited for if I remember right, for Months!"
3,An adventure through time,"Empire Earth comes with 4 engaging campaigns: Greek, English, German, and Russian. You also experience many eras: Prehistoric, Stone, Copper, Bronze, Dark, Middle, Renaissance, Imperial, Industrial, WW1, WW2, Modern, Digital, and Nano. With the expansion it adds new campaigns including a Roman Campaign. Also, it comes with a whole new Era: Space, with new units according to future units: robots and such. In the game you can build many military buildings which includes: Barracks, Dock, Stables, and much more! Graphically, the faces of the units are kind of dull: just eyes and a plain mouth. Otherwise, this is a game that is a thrilling adventure thru the ages!"
1,What a piece of garbage!!!!!!,I installed this program on our PC that runs all sorts of other games and it just locks up each time. I even upgraded our video card to no avail. I have more than the minimum requirements for hardware and still can not get this game to work. Biggest waste of money. Don't buy this unless you have the ultimate gaming PC like Alienware.
3,It's No Ages!,"I bought this game after hearing how much it was like Age of Empires. Some even clainmed it to be an improvement on Ages II with such awesome abilities such as more ages (or epochs) to experience.It is true, that the basics of the game are similar to AOE; however, the cool features such as expanded ages are nearly imposibble to experience. In short, if you want to start at the beginning of time and grow to the futuristic nano stage, you better not have many opponents or you'll run out of resources."
3,An adventure through time,"Empire Earth comes with 4 engaging campaigns: Greek, English, German, and Russian.

Otherwise, this is a game that is a thrilling adventure thru the ages!"
4,"Great Military Game, Not Much Socio-Economic Aspect","This is an excellent game, and is much better than Empire Earth II. It's fast-paced and simple: gather resources, build an army, conquer your foes. It comes with several excellent campaigns as well. The game spans all history, so it works for whatever type of player you happen to be. It even goes three epochs into the future. There's a large array of units, buildings, etc. The only cons with this game is that it doesn't have the cultural aspect of say Civilization III. This is a military game. That's why, in the event that all players are allied to one another, the game ends. But overall it is a very good game and an excellent addition to any computer game collection."
3,Not bad,"Good game for a while. The AI is horrible stupid though, or extremely smart there is no inbetween. I think AOE is far better. I played EE2 though and it was better as well. Skip this game and check out EE2, or go get AOE or maybe even RoN"
1,Absolutely dreadful,"I will keep this short, as short as my ownership of the set, which I sold one day after purchasing it. Nelly (the Queen Elizabeth) had her day and it was a good one, but this performance finds her long after sunset. She is unlistenable. Jose Bros is just not up to the part of Essex, which has been sung better by everyone else. Why continue? There are too many excellent recordings of this wonderful opera for anyone to have to put up with this one."
4,Color me Happy!,"This book has been perfect for me, a beginner bird watcher, because instead of listing by the latin or even common names, which would have been no help to me, it organizes the birds by color. So as long as you're not color blind, it's easy to find the different specimens you're looking for. My only complaint is that I would like to see a bit more description. Otherwise, it's perfect for beginners!"
3,Good for beginners,"I work at a nature center and the photos are excellent for use on hikes, when not all the kids saw the bird. The order of species makes identification from this book rather difficult, but it's a great little book overall!"
4,Great book,"I loved this book, it shares a great bible story from the book of Neamiah and how the holy spirit will rebuild, reshape and heal your past. Jack's insight is awesome!"
1,"Poorly designed toy, do not get!","It's poor quality, falls apart, and if you lose the little key, it's even less of a good toy! It conatntly falls apart and frustrates young children."
3,Unexpected but okay *Please change my review! ),"This video is actually 4 x 10 minute work outs. 1. The first set is a warmup for when you have just woken up. It isnt likely to create a sweat though although could still be used to get you motivated. 2. The second set is a warmdown. It is quite a good set, compared to the rest of the video. 3. The third set is for a warmup or warmdown. I would use it as a warmdown and then do a few more stretches. 4. The last 10 minutes is a relaxing/meditation set. She included some good stretches but it would be more peaceful if she was quiet for even a moment.Having written all this, it is not a bad video and you could use it. I dont believe it is one of her best."
3,poor quality,"I watch fit & lite on lifetime every morning. Its an easy way to get started on an exercise routine. I wanted to try one of her videos, but the quality is so bad its distracting. I thought there was something wrong with my vcr, but it was the same on the one in the bedroom. Whoever produced this video should really pay a little more attention to detail & quality."
4,works very well,"its detects wifi network only at the direction you point them, and only on a limited range, about 300 ft or less."
4,"Works well, sort of directional.","Works well, sort of directional but I wish it could tell you about the security (unlocked/locked) features of the wireless you find...but a fantastic little device for the money and handy in that it keeps you from booting up your laptop to see if there are any wireless hotspots around."
5,Laguna Lady,"Not your typical canning book, some interesting and adventurous ways to preserve from your garden or farmers market, and exciting compilation for the canner."
3,probably there worst,This is there worst album. However I still love it. Thats how much I like these guys. There is some excellent songs on it.
4,Devolutionary!,"Wow, this album is a great listen. Fans of De/Vision should love the new release, as well as fans of Depeche Mode and Camoflauge. I'd highly recommend it to these people. The songs have great lyrics, the vocals are superb, and the production is excellent. The additional disc with 4 remixes is pretty sweet as all of the mixes are solid and enjoyable.The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because it isn't a landmark release. Not much new is explored here. I've only listened to is a few times and none of the songs especially stick with me, except the Day's Not Done and Drifting Sideways. That may change with repeated listenings.But this is definately as good or better than De/Vision's previous releases and I really enjoyed it. I need to take it into a dark room and listen to it on good headphones, but as of right now, I'm glad I got it and will be keeping it my CD player for the forseeable future."
4,The band has potential,"I bought this cd of my former 12th grade english teacher, Dustin Buchhester(the fact that he is the singer of the band has no influence on my opinion of Post Depressionism). My original intentions with the cd were to buy it to hear what 20 Something sounded like without it being played infront of class on an acoustic guitar. I found that I like the cd alot. I dont really listen to this genre much but this is good. I love the lyrics...they work on so many levels. Its like the world around you in a song. Hard to explain. Catchy guitar..... All in all I love this cd. Mainly the song Drone. Good stuff, I will keep my eye on this band and keep listening."
1,Don't Bother Ordering This Used,"Amazon REALLY needs to improve accuracy. I bought this from a ""used"" seller and got Madden '94 for the 3DO gaming console. That's not even close to the correct product. Amazon doesn't bother to make sure that listings are accurate. This STUFF is unacceptable, inexcusable and totally preventable. We should be able to contact sellers PRIOR to placing orders to confirm that they will send us the correct bloody item!"
4,Classic American Brew Pack,"Always very pleased with ""Mr.Beer"". Any dissapointing batches were MY fault. I guess that when all else fails,I should have read the directions ! They also have great customer service to answer your questions and / or give advice."
1,"LCD 23"" wide screen & Windows XP","Hoyle has always been my favorite games but ever since I bought the new state of the art Dell computer with windows XP, and a 23"" LCD screen, Hoyle couln't take it. Only Hoyle games can't handle it as it creates lines accross the top of the screen, Bicycle games handle it perfectly. Please upgrade your program."
1,NEEDS ALOT OF IMPROVEMENT,When playing five card stud you may get 2 GOOD hands out of 28. Omaha Hold'em is just as bad........The computer players always seem to know when to fold........I will return mine and will not buy another one until improvements are made......wish I had checked online before purchasing!!!!!!!
2,Newest revision of Hoyle Casino is the worst yet,"Part of the problem with Hoyle Casino has always been that the odds have been heavly weighted toward the computer players. With this new version, it is even worse. Playing in a poker tournament, the computer players are constantly getting 3 of a kind, full house, straights and flushes, while you never seem to be able to catch these. And when you do get a good hand, they somehow end up with a better one. Also, if I was playing at a blackjack table in Vegas where the dealer was continuously getting 20 and 21 every single hand, I would leave that table. I would recommend that you go somewhere else for a casino game, this one is terrible.I wish that I had been able to play the game somewhere before I bought it, I never would have!!!Two thumbs down"
3,Hoyle Casino 2004,"It is really the 2008 issue and is OK. Plays well, easy to use. Nice packaging. I've run out of words."
1,It wasn't what you have listed they sent another product,This company ignored what I wanted and substituted another game instead of the one I requested. Prehaps the could care less of the customers wishes and only about their profits and ridding themselfs of their over stocked merchandise. I am disapoined in the transaction.
2,Something's Wrong Here..,"Shortly after installing the game, I start up a $1000, 14 hand Draw Poker tournament, with 8 players.I lost profoundly. Those eight players managed to come up with SEVEN four of a kinds. Over 14 hands.In all years of real poker playing I probably see a 5-card draw poker four of a kind one in every 100 or maybe 200 hands. Not 50% of the time.Next tournament, first hand, I managed a three of a kind, and lost to a flush and two full houses. Just how many cards are in this deck anyway?The graphics, sound, game choices, and presentation are nice, but with such a skewed random number generator, who needs it?Find the 2003 version in the bargain bin instead, which looks and sounds almost identical and at least played a fair, fun game."
2,It knows what you have in your hand!,"This game is OK for the basics, but don't expect anywhere near a real experience here. I can't tell you how many times I get beat on the last card, with just one higher card, say a 9 high to my 8 high. Always with only one card higher! That's not real. Plus, too many of the players are idiots, while a few are otherworldly lucky. It's nothing close to a random draw, and that's what you need for a real experience."
1,Hoyle's little money maker,"Boardroom:Suit A: How can we rake in lots of extra dollars from unsuspecting gamers?Suit B: I Know, lets change the year and the box, throw in some different backgrounds and sell it.Suit A: Brilliant! why did we not think of that last year?Suit B: We did.Suit A: Did we? OK lets roll with it."
2,Some good information but very out of date,"This book definitely needs updating. Though it has some good information, it's mostly intuitive and I found quite a bit of bad advice. The ""Stories from Real Life"" are clearly out of date as one references ""sleeping medicine"" for a baby prescribed from a doctor and many more reference spanking and slapping an 18 month old's hands. This book was not for me!"
3,So/So,"This book was ""okay"". Simply stated, if you are looking for validation about your childs' behavior, get this book. It's just a commentary on observations of behaviors vs. in depth explainations about why they behave the way they do and how to truly cope. It was a bit too superficial for me as I was looking for strategies to help with the behaviors not just an overview of what a child of this age does. I found the most useful part the personal stories at the end."
4,"Reassuring, but a little outdated","As a mom of 18-month-old triplets, I needed reassurance that my kids weren't abnormally difficult to handle. This book provided that. I actually laughed aloud at several parts because I felt like they were describing one of my sons exactly! The authors provide exhausted parents plenty of pats on the back, letting us know that we are not alone in wondering where our sweet little babies went. I liked that the book provided specific examples of typical 18-month-old behavior, because it helped me not get so angry with my kids. I realized that what they are doing is completely normal and me getting mad at them for it is kind of ridiculous. That said, this book was written in the late 70's/early 80's so some of the advice and ideas are outdated. But I'm sure anyone would recognize that and just take the good stuff from it. I'm hoping to read the next book in the series ""Your Two Year Old"" soon!"
1,Not much help or nem info here,"As a first time mom, I was looking for a book that helps address or tackle behaviors of a one year old. This book more describes what to expect at this age. it was not what i was looking for. This book did not provide advice or suggestions on how to address changing sleep patterns or how to avoid tantrums, but will describe that it will happen. Don't we already know that? If you don't then this is the book for you. It arrived on time just not what I wanted."
2,dated and repetitive,"Thankfully, I bought this book used for under a dollar because that turned out to be all it's worth. It's repetitive and reflects a dated view of child raising. For example, it discusses classifying toddler personality types based on their physical build (endo, meso and ectomorphs). I was looking for aWonder Weeksfor toddlers and this isn't it."
2,Old!,"This book is very outdated. ... says it has been revised, but mine was 15 years old, with no revisions. I returned it."
3,Informative but very repeatative,"This rather small book could have been a lot smaller if they had pulled out some of the repeatative information. I found the information regarding the emotional behaviour of a 12 - 24 month old (focusing largely on 18 months where they say most changes occur) useful, but I felt like I was in a grade school class room. Chapters and even paragraphs repeat entire sections of already presented information.I was able to read the entire book in two sittings. I'll go back and make some notes and then probably resell the book. I can summarize most of the book in two to three pages."
3,Easy to read and insightful information,I was desperate for a book on how to deal with bad behaving toddlers one of my neighbors gave me this. I read it pretty quickly and found it intresting but it does not touch base on the items listed on the cover. There is a paragraph on toilet training and really no solid advise on discipline. I wouldn't buy this new if your intrested rent it from your local library.I've heard great things about Toddler 411 going to read that next!
4,unfortunate,"Great book in said condition, except for the fact that someone got to it first to rip a page of his most famous poem out of the back. Transaction and delivery were prompt."
5,Review Bless me father,"Fantastic English comedy series, Arthur Lowe is a brilliant comedianRecommend it to everybody looking to put a bit of laughter into their lifeDelivery was extremely quick evn in the middle of the Christmas period"
2,"Great idea, poor design","I bought this controller as well as a San Diego Chargers wireless controller for both my kids for Christmas 06. All my anticipated excitement was soon squashed by the poor design of the battery compartment. It stacks the AAA batteries in a pyramid, 2 on the base with the 3rd on top. The 3rd battery constantly pops out and is very difficult to keep in. The compartment door itself does not stay closed either further aggrevating the situation. It seems those guys down at Mad Catz could design this with a rechargable battery and docking station. They say they redesigned newer controllers without the vibrating feature to save battery power. Should have spent that R&D time redesigning the battery compartment issue. Another issue is that the controller symbols do not light up, and if they did, it would be an added bonus. All and all a great idea, just needs some tweaking..."
3,bronco controller,I really love having my bronco remote. However I play hard and the casings around the joy sticks broke on my controller. So I suggest that you take an easy with the joy sticks.
4,wireless controller,"Contoller works well. We bought two of these and an't seem to use them at the same time. Signals get crossed. If used with another brand of wirless controller, it works great."
4,Nice Story but needed better Video Quality,"I honestly liked the movie a lot. It might have to do with the fact that I'm a father to a little girl and this movie is about a father and his daughter. Was the design a little cheesey? yeah but if you have an open mind and accept the fact that this is a fantasy, it becomes acceptable. It had a very nice, somewhat emotional ending. I just miight pick up the Blu ray."
1,AVOID THIS MOVIE! SERIOUSLY!,"This movie is horrible. I suspect a lot of the positive reviews come from people who either are involved with the film or close to those folks -- or possibly from people paid to write positive reviews. Or perhaps, they were on drugs while they watched it.I have no problem with less structured films. That's the beauty of independent stuff. But this film had a very thin plot and terrible actors. It paid no attention to character development -- at all. The best acting came from a very young girl - and I'm sure I'm being generous to her because of her age and cuteness.The cinematography is horrendous. It looks like it was filmed with a webcam. The director looks like he tossed in elements just to make the film underground. You know - things like chill out lounge music, ambiguous plots, mysterious characters. Unfortunately, these things cannot hide an empty plot.AVOID THIS MOVIE!!!"
1,Possibly the worse movie ever,While it has the best clip and trailor I possibly have ever seen the movie itself dissapoints. I wonder whether the producer had just learnt how to use all of the new features of his camera and was determined to fit them all into one movie. It makes you dizzy. each to thier own though.. i couldn't have made such a movie with $630 either..
1,Crap! Crap! Crap!,"Run away from this supposedly movie! Bad acting, Poor action, Poor scenario, Poor story! Unless you are a christian or in the comunity, just forget! Same kind of......let me say, Facing the giants (ugh!!) Fireproof! (double ugh!!).Make yourself a favor and save your money!!RUN!!!!"
1,NOT the best movie of 2009 or any other year,"I read these amazing reviews and rented this movie so I felt compelled to write a counterpoint despite not having finished watching the film (I do not intend to either). This film is not...good. The director is ambitious and has some interesting ideas however he does not have any budget, actors or a decent script. Some of the character ideas and sets were pretty cool however they are drowned out by the wretched acting and ham-fisted dialog. I'm not sure what the plot was because 10 minutes into the film I didn't care what the plot was, every-time one of the cardboard cutout characters spoke it hurt my brain, I lasted 25 mins then I shut it off. This is the kinda fair that a devoted Sy-fy channel watcher might suffer through but the less enthusiastic should avoid this film at all costs."
4,Ink,"The world of dreams is governed by the forces of light and dark, who face off in endless combat over the souls of the living. When a dark-robbed figure kidnaps the soul of a young girl, it is up to the Storytellers to awaken her father from his selfish stupor in order to free her from evil's grasp! INK is a mind-blowing visual masterpiece created on a micro-budget, which offers a unique fantasy world of found objects that rivals the ones found in MIRRORMASK or CITY OF LOST CHILDREN at only a fraction of the cost. Director Jamin Winans transforms the mundane into the imaginative through the use of creative camera work, practical effects, and a unique story structure as he weaves together his modern fairy tale. Winans enhances the emotional impact of the images on screen with his own original score. The combined results produce a touching character drama that will shatter all expectations and strike a deep emotional chord with the audience.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies"
5,A look inside,"Ink is a film that takes a look at the makeup of a damaged man and the doings around him. It was good to be reminded that there is a choice, right up until the end, that we can't run from our basic nature. Worth every second of time to watch but does take an attention span to see you through. Not enough booms and simple plot lines."
4,Definetly worth your time,"I accidentally rented this movie but it turned out to be a great accident. You MUST watch more then the first 15 minutes though!!!! The movie starts off kinda strange and you might be tempted to turn it off, DONT. Things get explained and really start to make sense. Now I do like sci fi and fatasy movies so I am slightly biased towards this movie but I really liked it. Its obvious its not a big budget movie BUT its not total cheese either. Some of the scenes and the music are really good. I highly recommend this movie and think the people who gave it 1 star are jaded by watching to many big budgeted special effect movies to really appreiciate a well made indepent film. Their loss. Enjoy!"
3,Original but flawed,"I'd recommend it solely because it's fairly original.I really wanted to like this movie more then I did. Bad acting, bad writing, bad editing, bad effects, even for an indie movie. Bad pacing.But, at least it's original and that's saying something in this day and age when most movies are a minor variation on some over told story."
5,Amazing,"I will not rehash the positive feedback that others have said. However, I will say this: Ink is an amazing movie. We watched the movie on Netflix and it captivated the attention of my whole family, a feat that is hard to accomplish. Unlike most movies, nobody talked during the entire movie. Moreover, we have watched it three times and will most likely buy it."
5,"Item is wonderful, Amazon's service is horrible","Though this movie is wonderful, if you order it here and now, even if you are to choose 2 day shipping and pay for that option, you will not see your movie until late november/early december. so dont even bother. and when you call to say that you dont think you should be charged for the promised earlier shipping date, you will be transferred to an individual in another country who can barely speak english. very frustrating. so although i give the movie five stars, give amazon's service negative stars."
5,"Very metaphysical, mystical psychological adventure","This movie is not a Hollywood big box production, therefore already has some things going for it. The special effects are not very smooth, but effective. A spooky film that seems to be going awry not only ""pulls it together,"" but left my psyche ticking over and over and over. Is this a cult film? I dunno. Ought to be, in the texture (but not narrative) of Donnie Darko. If you like to step beyond the bix box and take stairways to the internal, watch this film."
5,Speechless,"It's hard to describe how much I enjoyed this film. Especially without sounding trite. But ""Ink"" is undeniably exquisite. The story it tells, the themes it brings in, the visuals, the soundtrack... everything is so poignant and just... beautiful. ""Ink"" may be dark, it may have some harshness in it that is not entirely appropriate for children, but anyone who can stand some language and reality should watch it.This film is simply awe-inspiring. Well done, Jamin Winans and crew. Very well done indeed."
5,I Love This Movie,"brilliant, poetic, original, amazing, beautiful - this is a keeper! In the beginning it seems like there's all sorts of things happening that may seem random or separate. But this movie ties everything together and is shot so beautifully. It's about good and evil...about how humans are flawed, about shame, guilt, greed, love, redemption. love it love it love!"
5,INK Best of 2009,"Fantastic movie! I read the reviews and luckily saw this in the theaters and was happily surprised at this new age masterpiece. This movie is in my top 10 movies of 2009 and in one of my favorites of all time. Very well put together, very well acted, written, directed, and filmed. Great story with a great plot twist. Reminds me of Traffic, ""lighting and film style"", Momento, ""story telling"", Brazil, ""quirky scenes and characters"", It's a Wonderful Life, ""Redemption and self reflection"", and Dark City, ""Visuals and dimensions"". Like many films and like nothing I have ever seen before, I can't wait to buy this own it!"
1,Pretentious junk,"This movie looks like a film school final project. It's nothing but overbearing artsy editing grafted onto a bad fantasy plot that takes itself way too seriously and that has the emotional range of a hallmark card. From the beginning of the movie it's clear that the whole world of ""dream people"" is suppose to be read symbolically, so any bit of pleasure or fascination with the admittedly bad fantasy element is sucked out of you. In short, it's an unwatchable mess."
1,Most disappointing Movie of 2009,"After seeing all the rave reviews for this movie, I'm utterly shocked as to how so many people could praise such a film. I love almost every indie movie I see. But this movie gets two thumbs down. Bad story, horrible acting, awful directing, and bad editing all make for a terrible production. Looks like a film a teenager could make with a $10 budget or less. Also, the washed out filter effect is annoying to watch. Don't bother with this one."
1,Ink,"I read some good reviews of this movie and decided to buy it unseen. I actually got through the whole movie, but it was painful. It actually made me mad enough that I had to sit through this drivel for an hour that I threw it away after watching it so no one else I know would have to endure it. I usually like most any science fiction or fantasy based movie and I can usually appreciate a good bad movie, but this was a bad movie that acted like it was good. I would not recommend this movie to anyone."
1,lost time and money on this one...,The positive reviews must come from family and people that were involved in the production...or possibly the reviews are from the distribution company...save your money but most importantly save your time...
4,Little Bits of Perfection,"This film is an astoundingly good piece of work. It is what films such as ""The Prophecy"" and ""Constantine"" should have been instead of what they were. It is heavily influenced (in the best possible way as far as I'm concerned) by visual styles from films like ""12 Monkeys"" and ""City of Lost Children."" While I wouldn't say this film is perfect, it does have enough moments of perfection in it -- i.e.: cinema exists so that sequences like the one starting near minute 58 can be shown -- that I'd be afraid of people trying to improve it. As near as I can tell, the MPAA would rate it R almost exclusively for language; there is mild (brawling) violence and no sex."
4,the negative reviews are correct.,"this movie has poor acting and obvious dialog. that being said, i love this film. the world that it creates and the story it tells are captivating and emotionally moving. this is a great fantasy film. if you are a fan of Neil Gaiman's ""Mirrormask"" or ""Neil Gaiman's Neverwhere"" this film is highly recommended."
5,Awesome Deeply Moving Masterpiece!,I am 48 years old and have seen just about everything out there. Ink has become my all-time-favorite movie and there's nothing that comes close. I'm not a movie critic so I'll keep this short. The plot was outstanding. The actors and acting was superb. The musical score was out of this world. Well done! I am quite picky about things but cannot find anything to complain about. I purchased the blu-ray from Amazon and downloaded the soundtrack from Amazon as fast as I could after seeing the movie on Netflix. It's amazing what talent can do that millions of dollars in manpower and affects cannot!
2,HMMMM,This movie got good reviews from consumers on Amazon. I was not so impressed. Maybe I will have to watch it several times. But some of the acting was bad. It took a while to figure out who the characters really were.
2,not sure why ratings are so high...,I thought this movie was a bit confusing. The story didn't captivate me much and seemed like an amateur film. should have been a lot shorter and maybe would have been better. Usually I like surreal fantasy movies but this just didn't do it for me.
2,"""Hello dirt, how are we today?""","We tried to watch it last night, only made to about 50 minutes.An Irritating, annoying and confusing montage of fast to medium cuts, mostly mid to close shots, of every MTV style ""cool and with it"" camera move, filters, wash-outs, tints and just about every other hip photographic gimmick popular today. All style and little content.There wasn't time to ponder anyone's character since the shot will not be on screen long enough for a total mental process to occur. So we only had a vague idea of character and purpose. It just moved to fast, and we stopped caring about it and lost interest besides becoming increasingly more irritated.There may have been a great, even profound idea in there somewhere, but we were to annoyed to care.My friends ask me, ""isn't there something else you can put on instead of this""?I think that pretty much sums it up."
4,"Indie film with fun plot twists, interesting effects","Ink is not a slick hollywood production but well worth watching. The plot keeps you guessing and the message works well. There some great fight scenes. Low budget, yes. Entertaining? Very much so. You have to give respect and credit to the creative minds behind the film."
3,Was I supposed to guess the ending?,As soon as the camera revealed more of Ink's face I knew who he was. Therefore I knew how the story would PROBABLY end.And I was right.The interpretation of the good and evil characters were interesting but not unique. I didn't quite understand why there wasn't more of a battle between the finale's protagonist and the antagonist. The visual portrayal of the antagonist was also a bit trite. I think what might have given this film more merit for me was a little more of a backstory as to what need does the antagonist have for the girl's soul. It kept my attention and it was a decent one time see.
3,Very sweaty shoes,"Quality of shoes less than expected. The inside is made of plastic, so our daughter gets very wet feet when she weirs them for a while. They are also hard to get on her feet, even though the size is definitely not too small. Once they are on, she adores the squeaky noise though."
2,my 10 inch Sprint Ring is disappointing,"I bought this small 10 inch sprint ring by accident, and I am disappointed. I knew how great the 13 inch ring is, but the small ring is no better than my standard frisbee. I also find it very hard to throw, it tends to tilt over to one side and drop down. I tried to follow the instructions and bend the ring slightly, but it doesn't help much.So my recommendation is: stay away from the 10 inch ring, but get the 13 inch ring. The Pro ring is pretty amazing."
5,Excellent Frisbee,I have owned these type of frisbees and now I had a chance to buy one for my kids. Way better than the traditional one. More accurate easier to throw. Even my 6 year old daughter can throw it and make it fly. Can't go wrong and you save a few bucks compared to local retailers and that is if they have them.
3,Flying ring,It was a pretty good ring but a little hard to catch and it curves to the side but is is better than a frisbee so I'd say it is a pretty good buy
5,Best Frisbee Ever!,This frisbee is the best ever. It flies great and is easy to catch for beginners and children. My granddaughters can use this one and have trouble with other types.
5,Excelent,This toy is fun and durable. You must have in your car. Aerobie friesbee is excellent. My dog love this toy. Watch here: [...].
1,Piece of Junk,"We threw the disc for a half hour on grass. It didn't het any concrete, trees, or walls and it just tore as if it was made of paper. What a waste of money."
5,a good cd,with icps funny bowling balls mini film on the dvd a better cd than shangri lee but whatever dont get version 2 of hells pit
2,Very Dissapointed,"Isn't ICP suppose to be funny too? I admit, I was not a huge fan of the first two joker cards. In my opinion, the music and lyrics progressed a lot thereafter. Riddlebox, Milenko, Jeckyl Bros, Both Bizare's, Wizard in the Hood and Wraith were all great. This however seems to revert back to the early ICP stuff. So if you liked that, then this is fine. But if you are looking for more funny stuff and sexual materials, it is simply missing. It is all wicked, which is fine, but there is very little standout material. The beats are mostly forgettable and I hardly ever laugh. Maybe I am from the rock school more than the rap genre, but this CD lacks guitars (Piggy Pie), speed with aggression (We give no F@cks), humor (Please Don't Hate me)I hope they redeem themselves and cannot wait for live show, but frankly they either ran out of material or need Mike Clark back. At the very least, it's the cure for insomnia - something I never thought I'd say about an ICP Cd"
1,El peor trabajo con mucha diferencia,"Soy un fan vasco de los ICP desde hace bastante tiempo. Y la verdad que este Hell's Pit me ha decepcinado bastante. Me da la sensacion que nos ha colocado las sobras The Wraith. Los temas son realmente aburridos, con una carencia total de originalidad. Sera que Los ICP se nos estan hacieno viejos?. Pues no lo se.Pero amigos, tener mucho cuidado al haceros con este Cd. Ypara otra ocasion recomendaria alos ICP que no pongan en la portada tonterias como ""The darkest rap album from theinsane clown posse ever"" , que despues se pagan."
3,Yall gonna hate me.,"All right. First off I would like to state that I am a hardcore Juggalo. I have followed J's and Shaggy's epic saga ever since Carnival of Carnage strait to Hell's pit. But i was kinda dissapointed with Hell's Pit. It's a real fresh albulm. A good albulm, but not their greatest. It was just not made for me. I guess as a Juggalo, I don't wanna see myself in Hell's Pit and that's why i don't see Hell's Pit as a very jiggy albulm. Like J's said on the seminar DVD on Shangri-La, they didn't use the word Juggalo on Hell's Pit cause they don't wanna see a Juggalo in Hell's Pit. This CD was made just of the wicked S$!*T, not the family or the comedy. But like I said most of you ""Juggalos"" out there are gonna hate this Juggalo because of what i've said (but then again what Juggalo would hate another Juggalo for speaking their inner truth?)"
4,"i am not a juggalo anymore, but i still think this is a good cd","i really don't like icp, as they convince emo girls at my school to get high and cut themselves so everyone can make fun of them. back on topic, this is a good cd. i love real underground baby and bowling balls. those songs are just awesome."
5,icps most wicket ever,"THE creepiest album ever. this is icps dark side. in this album they explain all the ways not to go to shangri la. there is so much evil in this album. try listening to it in the dark. it will freak you out, especially the intro with the preacher talking backwards. thats so eerie and creepy. very good album from start to finish. love the end where the put clips from all the jokers cards in the song real underground baby. must buy for juggalos or anyone. play it on halloween. its great. MCL for all the los and lettes"
2,"I'm afraid not, Juggalos...","First off, I will always be down with the clown. ICP rules. I went out and got this album and I must say, I was rather dissapointed with it. A few of the songs were cool, but most of it was senseless slaughter and violence. It was so grotesque it wasn't funny, like Chicken Huntin' and Piggie Pie were. I can't say I recommend this one, sorry guys. The Wraith: Shangri-La was the real 6th Joker's Card, and I loved it. This alternate version, however...Much clown luv to all the Juggalo's out there, supporters and non-supporters of this album alike. Peace!(Also, mine didn't come with glasses O.o It said it comes with them on the packaging, but no glasses...odd)"
2,this album is just...meh,"This album hardly follows the concept of the wraith and hardly seems like the end to the jokers card series...but it is.I tried to let this album grow on me but after about 5 listens I just cant stand it anymore.It dose start out strong,but fall's flat after track 7.It feels more like one of the bizzar albums than the end to the jokers card saga!You can tell when listening to this that not much thought was put into it and the last track is the most idiodic and pointless thing I have ever heard.Dont waist your money on this trash"
4,Good information to review periodically.,"If you listen to Zig's ""Goal Setting"" series, you'd have most of the same information but, it was a good thing to listen too with my fiance."
4,A good book with lots of practical ideas that most people stop paying attention too,"This is a good book with a lot of practical ideas that you can start applying immediately. When you read it, what Mr. Ziglar says touches you deeply and you know it's true.While many of the ideas here are presented through the lens of Christianity, they apply universally. Zig Ziglar also has a way of making his point powerfully through entertaining stories and vivid metaphors.If you are a Christian, I'm sure this book will even mean more to you. However, if you are not a Christian, I still wouldn't hesitate to buy it. If your goal is to improve the quality of your marriage, this book will definitely help."
3,Uninteresting,"This Cd is not really good - the compositions ( expect Walking in Five)are uninteresting, Cobham's playing is not really amazing ( like we all expect), Cobham plays some great laid back grooves , but that was everything.....buy another Cobham album you'll be more happy!"
3,Interesting snapshot and quite prescient,"Interesting snapshot of Great Britain in the years immediately following WWII. Moberly argues that while the university should not be forced into specific dogmatic Christian principles, it needs to recover a sense of unity of purpose and ethics with regard to its moral obligation to education its citizens. It just so happens that basic Christian principles are a firm foundation on which to build such a synthesis of purpose. His arguments concerning the effects of secularization as the jettisoning of religious values is prescient in terms of the countrous of the debate today."
3,This is good techno for Mortal Kombat,This has some very cool techno music. The sad part is this CD will probably only appeal to the avid Mortal Kombat fan. It is still pretty cool for others too.
3,The end of an era(for awhile ),"After Superman and Batman, the Justice Society was one of the most influential comics from the Golden Age. The first ""team"" book, the series gave readers the excitement of seeing all these heroes working together, a truly novel experience. The last volume does continue with Broome's penchant for SF themed stories and the art is serviceable with Arthur Peddy continuing the art chores, but the stories lack the fun and excitement found in the middle of the title's run. Circus performers pale in comparison to Brainwave and The Wizard, and after awhile all the time travel and space alien's stories tend to blend together. Roy Thomas writes another informative introduction and the Archives collection is an affordable option to investigate what the Golden Age of comics is about."
3,Dubbed version - Digitally Remastered & Restored,"After paying $20 plus shipping, I found that this version is ONLY available in a British English audio. Probably the best dubbing I've seen for a Chinese film - but still takes too much away from the movie in not providing the original soundtrack. The movie itself is not bad - but is probably more interesting (cleverly worded & expressed) in the original soundtrack. 3 stars (average) for this version. (I would have preferred to pay the $40 for the ""special edition"" that includes original soundtrack - though that price is too high, considering a top-quality DVD in China costs $2 to $3!"
4,"If You Can Get a Clean Copy, You'll Enjoy It, But...","I recently purchased this intriguing CD and upon first audition, was delighted by the music. However, I was dismayed to discover that the final couple of cuts would not play on my CD player. I looked at the disc itself and found that the outermost area of the encoded side was marred by a light misty-looking defect. I listened to the previous cuts a few more times, decided that this was a CD well worth having, so I returned my copy to Amazon to exchange for another copy. Much to my dismay, the second copy arrived with the entire coded side of the CD covered with this cloudy defect. This copy would not play at all. Dang!At that point, I mailed it back and asked for a refund. My rating of 4 stars reflects the quality of the music I did hear, wheich was fresh and energetic. However, not having been able to obtain a nondefective copy, I feel constrained to issue a word of caution to prospective buyers."
1,Don't buy this,"Don't buy this, you can just buy seasons 1 and 2 separately on Amazon for $12.99 each.So $25.98 or over $50 for this set. Hmmmm."
5,MMM... Chicken,Love the show bought as a gift for my Brother. Now he's hooked. There were no problems with deliveries or product.
4,Catches you up,Very effective way of seeing the whole seasons without having to puchase season1 and two seperatedly.
3,"Yes, its a book on English literary history","This book is on historical study of famous authors, like Shakespeare and Chaucer. And, it is a perfectly fine book for that purpose. For some inexplicapble reason, however, some Christian apologists have latched onto this book for guidelines on historical research on the Gospels. It has nothing to do with that. I guess the apologists don't think someone will actually pick up the book and read it."
5,William Boyce,"William Boyce is a comparatively unknown composer, but one who merits greater recognition. He combines a wide ranging capability for orchestration, for innovative rhythms and for delightful melodies. Overshadowed by Bach, a youngerr contemporary, Boyce is a worthwhile addition to any serious collection"
5,Most Historically Accurate Info,This book is being used in my music class at Dartmouth College that's focusing on Beethoven. It contains very accurate information about the Maestro himself and does not add to the myths about the composer as other books do. It's very easy to read and there's a lot of satisfaction and knowledge that a Beethoven admirer can gain from this magnificent biography.
3,Only good if you live on the East coast,"Very nice maps and graphics, maps are reasonably detailed, however, this atlas has a serious defect in the way it depicts the Western states: Low population states like Utah, Wyoming and Nevada are given a single page instead of the double-page that their sizes warrant. Even Connecticut, which is tiny, gets a two-page spread, while Nevada, which has counties bigger than Connecticut, gets shoved into a single page. If you drive out West, you will want another atlas, perhaps a AAA, Gousha or Rand McNally. Overall good, but shortchanges Western states."
5,The Best!!!,This is THE ONLY road atlas to use if you want up to date construction and improvements on highways. It's sometimes hard to find - but it is worth the effort.None best!!!
1,Atlas,This atlas is suppose to be large print but the print is much too small. It was very disappointing.
5,Best book available on this (forgotten) subject.,"Very little information about the practice of painting (as opposed to tinting; there is a difference) photography has been available. This book covers incredible ground, pulling together material from advertisements, photography texts, archives and collections in order to present an overview of the climate, practice, and production of painted photography. Most other material extant focuses on individual artists who happened to overpaint their photographs, or of particular artworks which are photographs that have been painted on. Henisch shows the existence of a trend in early photography which seems to have been relegated to the sidelines as an analomy or as an isolated practice.This is an incredible work, well - written, and evocative of Henisch's broad scope of scholarship."
4,excellent album,"if simply for Kathryn Williams' ""Buzzin' Fly"" and Stephen Fretwell's rendition of ""Morning Theft,"" this album is worth getting... all the songs are genuinely new takes on these two amazing musicians... highly recommended"
1,Uninspiring from the get-go,"I can't say that I'm too familiar with the music of Tim & Jeff Buckley (please hold your hate mail), but I don't think that this tribute album of indie unknowns is going to win me over. It's uninspiring from the get-go."
4,Noam Chompsky on Language,Noam Chompsky is a genius. Relating to how the cognitive relates to the abstract. A certain muscular memory so to speak. I found the book very useful in my studies on linguistics.
3,Can't they at least write clear English?,"I'm giving this 3 stars just on the packaging, alone. It has not been installed, yet. If you're going to sell in the US market, please take the time to write your instructions in clearly understood and correct English! Module for the readout is very small -- that's a good thing. About half the size of your palm. Please be aware that you cannot cut the pre-configured wires running to the Sensors in order to lengthen them. This is true for any of these Sensor-type products."
5,"This is an excellent, excellent book!","""Loving God with All Your Mind"" by Elizabeth George is a book that I found so inspiring and insightful as I, too, suffer with depression. It is written so crystal clear, so easy to follow. Her knowledge of the scripture and her guidance using scripture allowed insight that I can use to gain control of my depression. I was so impressed with this book that I ordered the study guide that goes with it and plan to reread the book as I follow the study guide. Her book filled me with hope! I am looking forward to reading more of her books when I finish studying this one along with the study guide. I highly recommend it!"
4,Very good,"I ordered the book for the poem ""Solitude"" which I love, but I was not aware that this book is a reproduction of the original printed version, which means that some of the pages are hard to read where the text is not clear. And the text is big :-) Anyway, supplier was quick, and it was packaged well. I would order from them again, but I am not so concerned with original versions, just being able to read the poems."
1,a waste of time and money,I have read numerous near-death books and I've got to say this was one of the most UN-believable of them all. I can't believe I wasted my time and money on this con. He talked with Adam? Adam and Eve didn't have children? Jesus talked and laughed with him? Oh please do give me a break!
3,British postwar novels foresee Britain returned to barbarism,"""General strike in 1924 marks the beginning of the collapse of civilization. 150 years later England is reduced to neolithical barbarism.""- Gerber, Utopian Fantasy, p. 147.""The first of the many British postwar novels that foresee Britain returned to barbarism by the ravages of war.""- Anatomy of Wonder (1995) 2-107.""One of the most widely read scientific romances of the post-war years.""- Stableford, Scientific Romance in Britain 1890-1950, p. 239."
2,The scripts of several episodes in story form.,"I was very disappointed in this book, as I had expected the author would relate funny stories about things that happened during the filming of the AYBS series. Instead, it is merely the script set into ""Mr. Lucas said...."" form. If that is what you are looking for, then this is the book for you. The few pictures are the ones we've seen before in other books."
2,"""Weak as Water""","Besides an eleven-page introduction (""AYBS? Then and Now"") and two pages on ""The Birth of AYBS?,"" this book only contains scripts in story form from seven early episodes of the long-running Brit comedy. The stories include: ""Camping In,"" ""Up Captain Peacock,"" ""Wedding Bells,"" ""His and Hers,"" ""Coffee Break,"" ""The Hand of Fate,"" and ""The Clock."" There is also two sets of full color photos from the episodes. Some of the screen shots are not even from the episodes in this book as a couple of the photos have Mr. Goldberg and Mr. Harman whereas the stories have Mr. Grainger and Mr. Mash. There is nothing new or exciting for the fan who already has a few books about the show. If you want to curl up and read these episodes as stories, this is the book for you. I, however, would rather pop in the video."
4,Lighten up and laugh!,"Of course, this little book cannot compare to the comedy of the actual BBC series. However, for those short stints on planes and a quick read before sleeping, this book's chapters are a wonderful opportunity to revisit those wacky characters at Grace Brothers. I found myself chuckling and enjoying the nice stories (yes, they are all actually based on plots of individual AYBS? episodes). If it's raving rioutous comedy you are after, this is not the book for you."
1,A re-run not worth the postage,"I'm a big fan of Are you Being Served, the long running British sit com set in a London Department store, so when I saw this title ""Camping in and Other Fiascos"" by the show's long time producer, I Thought it would be a behind the scenes peek at a show that in 12 seasons must have had some very interesting tales to tell.The forward, with comments by some of the surviving cast members seemed to support this. Then I got to the meat of the book. Each chapter is in fact a novelization of an episode, but with other, well known vignettes from other episodes worked in.While this might make funny reading if you've never seen the show, long time fans can almost repeat the scripts themselves. Without any bonus materials THIS is in effect, a re-run of well known episodes.I'm a fan of the show. I'd love a chance to tell the cast members how much I've enjoyed their work, but this tome? Not worth the price of postage."
5,I'm Free,"I haven't seen this in over seven years. It doesn't matter. If you U.S. citizens can pick up PBS on your tele, get on over there at about 11PM. Don't watch the news. It'll just repeat what you saw during dinner and read in the newspaper and/or on the Internet, and depress you besides. And, since I mentioned meals, give you indigestion. I lived in the U.S. for 36 years, and the last newsperson I watched was probably Walter Cronkite. So, blow off the news and watch this show instead.I have no idea why I'm writing this. It's been ages. But, I stand by it. Unless, that is, Dubya lobbed a few smart bombs at PBS under the Patriot Act. One can never be sure.(Bombs smarter than the president, I might add.)"
5,Better then I thought,So to be honest with you I thought they were going to be a little dull and I have been putting together a L.E.D set up for my tank and having just 4 lit up the tank nicely and can't say anything at all bad about it and for the price compared to going to radioshack or anything like it I will stick to buying from Moddersmarts.
3,"Good, but...","This movie is good. I'm going to be honest I was expecting more but is good enough...I was hoping for it to be WIDESCREEN but sadly is in FULL-SCREEN, BIG TURN-OFF...It serves it purpose as entertainment..."
5,My kids love it!!,"My kids love this movie!! it is very sweet and interesting for them, they are 3 and 5 years old."
5,Beige Not Pink But Fine Otherwise,They don't look the same color but fit and feel fine. No reservations in recommending the product or the vendor.
1,Bali Women's Lacy Skamp,"Very disappointed with the fit, fabric, and overall quality of this panties. It tends to ride up in the back and the material is so thin it will not last long. The lace elastic on the upper part of the underwear folds back instead of holding your stomach in. Very disappointed!!"
2,Pretty but.....,"I like pretty, lacy panties. These would be great but please note, Hi-cut means HI-CUT. Do not wear these with regular or low rise pants. Recommended for dresses. They lose their shape easily. Hand wash only.Reasonably priced, quality is ok, but not the sexiest... unless you like half of your stomach to be covered by your panty."
2,Too high waisted,The waistline is too high for me. I ordered according to the size chart but it just seems too big. The fabric is ok and is washable. I'll try a low-rise next time.
3,"Sex & Comfortable, but waist band does stay like this.","No complaints. However, the waist band tends to rollup. Not uncomfortable and it does not show, but if you want it to not rollup, you better have a flat tummy."
3,fancy panties,"Bali Women's Lacy Skamp Hikini #2144I am used to firmer support in panties, but these are very pretty and I like the cut."
2,Not what I expected,"I have bought many Bali items and loved the quality, fit, color, etc., but not these. They run small and are tissue paper thin. Make sure you read the return policy. At the very end they state no returns/exchanges on initmate apparel."
3,Exactly as advertised...,"I was happy when I go these, they were exactly as advertised. I don't rate them higher because I have since changed my diet-philosophy. I eat Primal now and believe wheat is the devil. I have a strong science background and primal holds up while making every other diet sound like a fairytale."
5,A good beginning for the study of health,"I am studying to be a certified nutritionist and this is the textbook for my first class. I have found this book to be very thorough, yet consise and to the point. The information is pertinent and up-to-date. The authors take a holistic approach and the book covers diet, healthy lifestyle choices, emotional health and well being, as well as important information on body functions. It isn't overly technical (which is nice for a beginner) but provides enough detail. I recommend it as an introduction to learning about nutrition or health."
2,I did not like it,"The tea was subpar and I am not sure if it was because I have usually gotten the higher end of this or not but, it was not what I was expecting. Maybe if you know what this one tastes like then it will be great. I love Assam black tea- it is my favorite. I should have just gotten what I wanted even though it was more expensive. This is sort of middle of the road in terms of Assam varities."
5,Good role model for girls~,My daughter is so happy to own this movie! She oined martial arts so she an save the world like Kim Possible!
2,Sooo not the drama- and I'm not kidding,"This movie was fine but absolutely nothing special. It focused more on Ron, which was a big downer. It was missing all the ""just friends"" stuff between Ron and Kim and also, you didn't see any of Shego slamming Drakken's plans which is one really funny part of the show. Plus, Kim and Ron do not make a good couple. It didn't have as much pure butt kicking action as normal, this moview definetly focused much more on romance. Wade has a much lesser part in here, as does just about everyone. Rufus, Kim, Ron, Drakken and Eric were the only ones with decent sized parts. Shego was downsized to include more Drakken, which was a very bad move, she is the much more interesting character. Oh, and Kim's big weakness? That was about the crummiest thing I've ever heard of.Watch it but don't buy it. Get Sitch in Time instead, much better for the value."
1,Dear Mike Morrison,I hate kim possible just as much as everybody els but if you could please leave my favorite show Buffy the vampire slayer out of your rampage for stupid teen super heroes.
5,Kim Possible kiss Ron Stopple,I like when Kim kiss Ron its so cute and funny I hope have a great future. I wish they put this movie on Theaier it will be so cool if they did that so the whole world can see it
4,Why not the big screen,Why did this movie never hit theathers just cause it's not 3D animation thats what's wrong with this generation the United States have forgotten about regular drawing cartoon movie's that can be good sometimes too. I rather watch it over Sponage Bob any day. I love her theme song she's a cheerleader fighting crime and she doesn't look all that bad for a cartoon character I wonder if she's a exotic dancer.
2,Not as good as non-Amazon ordered bars,"I buy these Luna bars (choco peppermint) very frequently, both at Trader Joe's and normal grocery stores.I ordered this bulk pack from Amazon, but it turns out they are different from all of the others that I have bought.I won't buy in bulk from here again - the price difference doesn't make up for the decrease in quality of the bars."
2,Lemon Zest Bar Review,I thought the Lemon Zest flavor tasted like lemon kitchen cleaner .... a Fantastik bar. It was also cloyingly sweet. Would not recommend.
2,Great Bars--This flavor not so good,"I love this product line of bars- they are very good for you, but yet very satisfying. But, I didn't care for this flavor at all--it was nothing like I thought it would be. I would try a different flavor."
4,"So far, favorite flavor","Usually, Luna bars come with crunch oats and nuts, but this one has brownie texture.Even the package was push by stuffs on the truck, brownie doesn't get crack like oatmeal bar.&#26085;&#26412;&#20154;&#12364;&#22909;&#12365;&#12394;&#21619;&#12384;&#12392;&#12362;&#12418;&#12356;&#12414;&#12377;&#12290;&#20581;&#24247;&#38754;&#12395;&#27671;&#36963;&#12387;&#12390;&#12289;&#12459;&#12525;&#12522;&#12540;&#25511;&#12360;&#12417;&#65281;"
2,Where's The Peanut Butter???,"Luna promised me a protein bar with peanut buttery goodness but I was lied to!!! This in no way tastes like a peanut butter cookie, let alone peanut butter anything. The first ingredients should be peanut something or other but its towards the bottom. I knew that this was not going to be like a peanut butter cookie but I thought at least it would have a peanut butter taste. I guess the best way for me to describe the taste would be like a very sweet yogurt like coating on the bottom of a supper sweet saccahrin sweet rice crispy thing. The one that I really enjoyed was the Nuts Over Chocolate luna bar, that one has a nice peanut taste and delicious chocolate bottom to boot. So dont go in thinking that you are going to get any peanut butter taste at all, but if you like a mystery flavor thats really sweet then go for it. I give it two stars because at least it has nutrition in it."
5,Delicious,"These are the best tasting Luna Bars! A healthy treat for my sweet tooth. I generally rotate between the flavors, but this is one that I always keep on hand."
3,"Luna Bars, Chocolate Pecan Pie...",is not my favorite Luna bar. I usually keep an assortment of Luna Bars in my desk drawer at work to stave off hunger pains. The Chocolate Pecan Pie bar is light and tastes more like a rice krispie bar than a protein bar - doesn't leave a soy protein after-taste like some bars do. I just happen to prefer some of the other Luna bar flavors better.
3,dark chocolate variety pack,"If you don't like dark chocolate, don't get the items included in the variety pack."
5,Not too sweet,"I love these bars, but why are they for ""women."" I think that they are great for anyone who wants a food bar and not a candy bar."
5,Caramel Nut Brownie Luna Bars- YUM!,"I eat one of these every day for breakfast, so I decided it would be cheaper to buy in bulk. They're easy to keep in your purse, healthful and delicious!"
3,Disappointed with Amazon,"The new Dulce de Leche Luna bars are actually fantastic! Not the ones I received, though. Amazon sent me an old batch of Luna Bars - before they were redone. I was quite disappointed as the new bars were out in the stores for at least a couple of months before I ordered mine on Amazon, but I still received the older bars which are not half as good as the new ones. Anyway, I would give the new bars a 5 star rating because they're brilliant!!!"
3,"Luna Bar, Peanut Butter Cookie","I mainly buy these for my sister who loves themI, however, find the taste overly-sweet and artificial. But you can't beat the price, especially during Amazon's promotional deals."
5,"Great selection, great taste","Made for women but strong enough for... everyone! These taste great and make other bars look and taste like critter cookies. We've tried the Clif bars and they're OK, but my teens fight over who gets the Luna bars. These are tasty, not like roughage and wood chips."
2,Weird Aftertaste,"The lemon zest bar tasted great but left a weird aftertaste...that lasted all day. This didn't happen with the nuts over chocolate bar (kind of bland, BTW.) I wouldn't buy the lemon zest flavor again because of the aftertaste."
4,Lemon Zest,"Nice chewy texture, great natural lemon flavor. Great as a snack or breakfast on the go. Healthy ingredients and good taste all in one."
4,"Great bars, bad price!","I like the Luna bars. Lighter-weight and more vitamins than the original clif bars. Most of the flavors I have tried taste great; some are too sweet for me. I like that they are a healthier alternative to granola bars that are made with corn syrup and deficient in vitamins.Amazon is not the place to buy these, though! You should never be paying more than $1.00 per bar. Trader Joe's is a great place to get these (and normal clif bars ($.99))."
1,Horrible,"From previous reviews I really thought I was finally going to find a nutrition bar that tasted good and was good for you. Well, I hope it is good for you, because it tastes like sawdust and honey. My husband bought me a variety of different flavors with the same result. The bar is very dry and there is very little flavor about it. I know some people love them, but count me out. I'm not impressed at all."
3,Luna Berry Almond bar,"I purchased a box of Luna Berry Almond bars. While they were tasty, the consistency was very sticky and the wrapper was hard to peel away from the bar."
2,Disappointing and not as good as other flavours,"Although the first bite had a nice mild lemon flavour, the next few bites started getting worse. It started tasting oily and buttery, and I found myself feeling sick by the end of it. One of the worse Luna bars - stay away."
1,Ewww,"This tastes just like it says, ZEST. Try chewing on the rind of a lemon and you'll know what these bars taste like. Not all that appealing to me, but I guess some people like that. The other flavors are a lot better."
1,I tried to like it,"I thought I would try this bar because I have heard good things about Luna Bars. After taking the first bite I knew I didn't like the artificial taste, but I took another bite because I didn't want to waste the money I paid for it. After the second bite I just could not make myself eat anymore of it so I threw it away. I would never buy this variety again, however I did try the Raspberry Chocolate variety and thought it was pretty good for a protein bar."
1,Not at all what I expected,"I had never eaten a Luna bar before I made this purchase, so I had expectations that were not even close to being fufilled.When I read ""chocolate Pecan Pie"" .. I expected just that.. the taste of rich chocolate, with nutty pecans and a gooey sugary base. What I received was a bar with little taste, nothing at all similar to the name on the bar.In my opinion, the bar is edible if you have no expectations of it... the flavor is barely there. The bar is dry. It is never again be on my ""purchase"" list"
4,Chocolate chips would make it perfect,"Pretty standard fare for a Luna Bar, which is pretty much a good thing. Soy crisps laden with pretzel pieces, peanuts, peanut butter smears and peanut butter chips; there is a peanut butter-y sort of candy coating on the bottom portion. If only there were dark chocolate chips or pieces tossed in the mix... I guess I'm just a chocoholic, but theLuna Bar Chocolate Dipped Coconut, 25.4-Ounce, 15-Barsreally raised the bar on Luna products for me. All in all, a pretty tasty treat!"
3,luna bars,"ok,so I bought these based on reviews I saw.....they are ok..not great. kind of funny taste to them. cookies and cream are better than lemon. I sent the peppermint ones back. I guess they are better for you than a lot of other products, that is why I purchased them. I eat them when I am really hungry and they satisfy that."
4,"Great Deal, Great Taste!","Out of all the hundreds of nutritional bars, Luna is definitely my favorite in terms of health and taste. I am not a health nut but apparently these bars are made just for us women and they taste delicious. I can eat one for breakfast and it holds me over until lunch. I think buying them on Amazon is the best deal. All of the flavors are pretty decent but Nuts Over Chocolate is definitely one of my favorites."
4,a great snack,"These were a great snack and I did feel as if I had a bit more energy after eating them but I don't know if that was just because they have quite a bit of sugar in them, the caffeine from the chocolate or a combination of both. This is extra chocolatey."
4,Loving Luna,When combined with a latte this low calorie high protein bar produces a peppermint mocha experience. Plus each bar has a delightful bit of inspiration inscribed on the back.
3,Still too sweet. Caramel sticks in teeth. Overall good.,I still feel 12 to 14g sugar is lot.Lot of them have Caramel. Which sticks in teeth. Try glenny's slim carb big crunch bars. Has only 2g sugar and very tastee. Try glenny's products like cliff bars.
4,Not Bad,"I like the chocolate raspberry bar the best. I did not notice that the ones I bought were "" new and improved"". Generally, my experience is that new and improved means smaller in size and the taste is now different. Well, not so with these bars. I think they actually taste better."
2,Lemon Zest...Nasty,"The Lemon Zest ones are just plain nasty. I love lemon and lemon flavored treats but I do not suggest these. I only ate one and wish I could send them back, I'm going to give these away if someone will have them. Yuck! Now,the Chai Tea ones taste better but I would only eat in case of an emergency (car break down, nothing to eat). I should have stuck with the Chocolate Pecan ones of real food."
1,Out of stock,"Wondering why these are still listed as 'in stock', when they are NOT in stock and, in fact, no longer being made by Clif/Luna??"
1,burnt flavor,"While I really liked the white chocolate macadamia nut flavor, the nuts over chocolate tasted nasty, with a burnt peanut taste. Would not ever try again!"
5,tasts like samoes,"I agree with the other reviewer... defiantly tastes like samoes, I tried them and didnt even read the reviews and thought I was eating a samoes cookie. dont know what the other reviewer was talking about!"
2,Melted Tops!,"I do love Luna Bars... but when I received mine, you could tell the package was placed upside down and in heat. All of the tops were melted and stuck to the wrapper. They obviously still tasted good, just difficult to eat."
4,Not my favorite Luna flavor,"I'm a big fan of Luna bars, so I decided to branch out and try a new flavor. The smores flavor is good, but certainly not my favorite. If you're a first-time Luna snacker, I'd go with the caramel nut brownie variety. Or try the peanut butter Luna protein bar if you'd like an extra boost of protein and a more candy bar-like experience."
1,"I like LUNA Bars, just not BERRY ALMOND...","I was sold on Luna Bars when I tried my first one from a grocery store: Lemon. Yum! Who could want a candy bar with a health bar tasting like that! Not so with all flavors. Berry Almond tastes like grape jam mixed with half-cooked oatmeal. That is the texture and color of what it would look like as well. My hubby loves it but I can't stand the flavor, I literally gag. It's obviously a preference thing but I had to leave the box of bars sitting out where they'd be eaten up instead of keeping them in my ""health-food stash"" I use before I go running. Yuck. I do recommend Luna Bars, however, just buy one before buying an entire box so you can find your favorite flavor. :)"
2,I Was So Disappointed,"At 60 yrs old, I'm just beginning to experiment with different types of bars that are a healthier choice. I learned several good lessons when ordering the Luna Bars. Not all tastebuds are equal!! To me they had the strangest taste of any bar I've tried. To make matters worse, the order got doubled somehow, but I didn't have the heart to send them back since it was my fault. I will take more time to read ALL of the best reviews. I often do this to prevent the kind of problem that happened. I'd have to look and see what I paid for them, but if anyone is interested, I'd make you a deal on a box of these Luna Bars. Sorry Luna, you've got a long way to go!!"
2,Over priced,This is a delicious bar. I literally eat one a day. But if they are priced above $15 that is crazy. A single bar is about a dollar. So you are not really saving anything by buying a whole box. And $15.09 per box.... I get a box $14.99 at the commissary. Not much of a difference but hey! It's a few extra cents in your pocket!!
3,"Tastes like fish food, but good for on the go","Luna Bars taste and smell like the stuff I use to feed my tropical fish i.e. some sort of nutrition blend disguised as bars (for my fish, flakes). But for something to grab on the go or someone with a busy schedule who doesn't have time to cook (or eat elaborate meals), the nutrition blend of vitamins and minerals offered by this bar is quite remarkable."
1,Don't buy them,"I am amazed that all these so-called health foods will add artery-clogging ""palm kernel oil"" as an ingredient. Don't buy anything with palm kernel oil, cocoa butter, and anything hydrogenated!! No matter how many ""organic"" things are added to it.For many years now, it has been established that palmitic acid carbon atoms increase the risk of coronary heart disease. The World Health Organization in its report states there is convincing evidence that palmitic oil consumption contributes to an increased risk of developing of cardiovascular diseases."
3,Why oh why,"When I first got a Luna bar I got it on v-day from my mom. I LOVED it! So I ordered a box of s'mors Luna bar's. They were not as tasty as the first one I had tried. And after a few days of eating one a day parts of my body started to become swollen. My hands, feet, knees, underarms,and a little of my face became swollen. It could have been the Luna bars but it could have been something else. I love Luna bars but I wouldn't get the S'mors anymore. Maybe something else."
1,Infested with maggots!,"I just opened up a S'Mores bar and found that it was infested with maggots! A Google search reveals that others have had this problem as well. I would assume that this is a rare occurrence, since I found only two other people who have encountered the same problem, but that's still too many for me. Needless to say, I've cancelled my subscription to all Luna Bar products and won't buy them ever again."
5,No longer recommend (9/09),"Original review (1/07):These bars are very good, crunchy and chewy. They are not a substitute for a candy bar; if you want chocolate or other popular candy bar types, look elsewhere. But if you want a healthy, tasty snack, give these a try. I even put peanut butter and jelly (thin layer) on a bar for a meal in a hurry.Revised review (9/09):The company for some reason has CHANGED these bars, decreasing the protein and calories, and increasing the sugar. They are now too sweet, and the wonderful balance of protein-sugar is gone. I emailed them about this, but they didn't bother responding.Sadly I cannot figure out how to decrease the number of stars I originally gave this product."
5,Good protein bar designed for women,"I had bariatric surgery. Afterwards, I tried numerous protein bars--they all tasted very bad. I happened upon Luna bars--I saw they were designed for women-and read the contents. They contained more vitamins and minerals than any of the higher priced protein bars, even the ones the bariatric department at the local hospital was pushing. I like most of the flavors--they aren't real sweet, they aren't dry, and there is no after taste. I've lost over 170 lbs and I know it wouldn't have been possible without the Luna bars. They gave me energy, took care of my sweet tooth, and are very convenient. I still took regular multi-vitamins--they don't replace those, just supplement what you are already taking."
4,Better tasting & healthier than...,After ordering windsor pilates they recomend eating energy bars as a snack with no more than 150 calories & 3 grams of fat; Luna for woman was closest to what was recommended having 170-180 calories & under 3 grams of fat. They taste good too. I highly suggest these as a fixer until your next meal.
3,Comments about Chai Tea flavor,"The dominant flavor of the Chai Tea bars is Cardamom. Although it contains tea, ginger, cinnamon, cloves, etc., they have not really balanced the flavors, and you will likely notice only the cardamom flavor. If you're thinking this bar will taste like tea, forget it. Emphasis strongly on the word Chai, not Tea. (Chai tea is flavored with cardamom and other spices.) If you don't know what cardamom tastes like, it's one of the staple spices of Indian cooking, comes in pods with small black seeds (which, by the way, are great to drop in a cup of coffee...) I'd advise you to buy a bar somewhere and try it, before you buy a box; some will truly love its exotic, spicy flavor; others may despise it."
5,my favorite,"I really like these because I feel I'm having a candy bar that's full of vitamins,and fiber."
4,Good one,"I have recently tried the Luna Bar Lemon Zest, and it was tasty. Not my favorite Luna, but good balance of lemon flavor. Luna Bars, along with Cliff Bars, are generally the best bars in terms of taste and nutrition."
5,by far my favorite Luna Bar,"great bar, not heavy like MANY of these bars are, the chocolate tastes like real chocolate. I love them, and I have to fight my kids over who gets them. That means they must be very good indeed!"
5,Exactly what I wanted,"I have the vinyl version of this album and wanted a digital copy as well. It was not available on iTunes or elsewhere in digital format, so I turned to Amazon to find a supplier. As usual, Amazon did not disappoint. Thank you Amazon!"
2,Do It Your Way,"Not quite the same as the original album. I bought it for ""Dreaming A Dream"". However on this cd they mixed it with another song. Why not leave the original alone and then add the mixed version too ? Rest of cd just average stuff."
4,Comprehensive Look at Belgians,"I am very pleased with the depth of the coverage. This book offers a wealth of knowledge for beginners but has enough details for those who have been in the breed for awhile. I was slightly disappointed that almost all of the photos depicted the author's line. Although rightfully proud of her lineage, other breeders offer different but also correct structure and types of the breeds and should be offered for comparison. Also, at times, the author uses terms without adequate definition (like ""European"" type).Overall, this is a wonderful book that will be kept for ready reference."
4,"soul, funky, bluesy, jazz sax with pumping large band","I really like Eddie Harris, particularly his use of what he calls vari-tone sax, which is sax with a harmonizer--he picks an interval, be it low octave,third or whatever, and adds a touch. It's wild. Some of his discs are a bit dated but the selection on this disc is funky and fine."
5,THIS IS A HAPPY CD,"I bless Eddie Harris, wherever he's playing now. This is one of my favorite CDs, not only because it was the last one he recorded, but because I love the arrangements of Freedom Jazz Dance and Sidewinder on here, and I love big bands. This CD will make you smile. NOTE to all school jazz band directors. Start your students early in playing jazz. Middle school is not too early. Don't wait until high school."
5,American Writer with Style,"Wonderful and written with style, this young adult novel encourages teens to steer away from the darkside of drugs by showing them how easily a drug dealer can prey upon the innocent. I have purchased several copies upon the advise of a friend to give to other youth in our Church."
5,Bruno's Review,"Well I'm gonna have to give this book 2 thumbs up also. Its good, clean literary fiction."
5,A fire side reader,"Until recently I didnt get into reading. I spend most of my free time playing basketball. A few months back I tore out my left knee and the doctor told me to stay off it while it healed and soon I was sick of tv. My sister bought this book for me and I figured why not? Not like I was going anywhere for a while.Anyways, I liked it so much I read it twice and found things the second time I missed the first. I reccommend this book to anyone who wants to read a good book."
5,West Coast Player Reviews a book for YOU !,I love action and fast pased movies like the Fast And The Furious. I think this novel is nicely written and I was pretty well pleased with the action parts and caught a lot of references to things I am familiar with from my vacations in Key West. I have never been to north carolina but I liked the scenic parts of the story. I got this book because my cousin went to school with Mary Wright and I wanted to see if she wrote as good as I had been told. Shes a real good writer and I agree with Angie that she could really make it big. Angie said that Mary was always getting the high marks in english classes and I am not surprised. I have a high school diploma and I work a lot so I was glad I didnt waste my evenings reading this book.
4,The Roto Warriors attack the Pan-American Highway.,"Hunter S. Thompson may be Gonzo, but Garry Sowerby and Tim Cahill are Roto.Sowerby and Cahill run a GMC pick-up from Tierra del Fuego to Prudhoe Bay in twenty three and a half days, breaking the world record in the process. Possibly even more amazing is the fact they survived almost exclussively on a thousand boxed milk shakes, beef jerky, and instant coffee mixed in ratios that can only be described as 'chunky'. As harrowing as narrow Andean mountain roads are, and boarder crossings made at gun point (literally)...one is left in awe and wonderment of their intestinal fortitude.For anyone dreaming of such an adverture this book is a real wake up call. All you need is a bevey of sponsers,about three or four hunderd thousand dollars and enough international political contacts to qualify for an ambassadorship... before the trip begins."
2,Surprisingly Forgettable,"Driving from the tip of South America (Tierra del Fuego) to the top of North America (Prudhoe Bay, Alaska) in a race to make the Guinness Book of World records--sounds like an exciting road trip and enjoyable read, right? Not so much, as it turns out. The first 125 pgs of the book detail the drivers getting all the documentation in order and laying the groundwork for their trip and frankly are pretty boring. Once they actually begin the trip things get a bit more interesting, though only barely. I found myself constantly losing interest and trying to clearly figure out how far into the journey the author is at any given time, as strangely there are no maps included with the book. Overall, I'm glad I only paid a few bucks for this book, as I'm sure the only thing I'll remember about it after a while is how annoyed I was that a topic that could have been truly interesting was turned into a ho-hum travelogue."
2,Don't Expect Too Much,"I am a big fan of non-fiction adventure stories, and bought this book based on the advice from this board. The book is basically a yawner. SPOILER COMING: Nothing happens. I kept waiting for either the adventure or the humor. Needless to say, I played the part of the jilted reader. If you read this book, your response will be: ""what's the big deal, I could have done that."" I think Tim's motivation for this book was solely cash (nothing wrong with that - just warn me first). It was clearly written out of contractual obligation and not because he truly had something to say."
2,JUST A ONE SONG SINGLE,"IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR THE INTERESTING COMBINATION BETWEEN NOEL GALLAGHER AND PAUL McCARTNEY, YOU WILL BE SATISFIED, IS A GOOD ALTERNATE VERSION OF ""COME TOGETHER"", THE OTHER THREE TRACKS ARE NOT WORTH TRYING TO LISTEN !!!"
2,Seiko Classic,"Clean, crisp styling in a Seiko Classic. I bought an earlier iteration of this watch in Japan in 1969 and wore it for 30 years. After that, no other watch I tried seemed right, so I bought this one. My best bet is that 30 years from now, Seiko will still be making a watch that looks just like this one -- it has that kind of timeless appeal."
5,Excellent Watch,"I purchased this watch from Amazon as a retirement gift for my father. He absolutely loved it. It is a very a simple yet elegant watch, good for both daily wearing and for special days. No other site can beat Amazon's price..."
4,Excellent watch at this price-point.,"My parents bought me an earlier version of this watch for my high school graduation in 1983. I'm on my second replacement, which means each watch is lasting about fifteen years. Not bad for a $99 watch, especially considering I'm pretty hard on my watches! The last one wasn't terribly water-resistant. That's about my only criticism. I like the simple design and display. If I treat this one better, perhaps it will last 20? Some of the negative reviews are pretty thin on details."
2,In search of diaper tote,"Although this bag is very cute and large enough to hold what I need - the advertised zipper closure is misleading. There is a zipper across the top, but it doesn't go from end to end. There are two large holes on both sides, and if I put my wallet in the bag it could easily fall out. I am going on a plane soon and I need a bag I know will keep my items secure and this is not it."
2,Not worth the money,"I bought this along with her other two stretch videos as a four pack set for 29.99. I feel I overpaid at that price, let alone buying separate videos. While I like doing the stretches, the two videos that make up this set are redundant--one is all you need, and the actual workout ends up being only about 8 minutes--I wish I had known how short it was before I made my purchase."
5,Full disclosure,"The review below (""Terrible Book"") was written by a guy who hawks HGH on the internet, and thus has a financial interest in discrediting books like The Juice. He's obviously not an objective reviewer.The Juice is as insightful and well-researched as Carroll's Baseball Prospectus column, of which I am a longtime fan. Highly recommended."
4,Misleading title but a useful primer on PEDs,"Well worth the money. A good source for folks like me who do not have much knowledge of PEDs. I have never taken a chemistry class and would certainly fail it if I did, but this short but engrossing book covers the steroid history very well. Carroll has contributed to the literature on the subject by writing a primer for people who know Barry Bonds and A-Rod, but are unfamiliar with how and why folks take these drugs. Having never been a good athlete and never been exposed to PEDs in the real world, I had zero knowledge of the subject other than what has been covered in the mass media.Not a great book and some material I felt should have been left out, but overall I can recommend it to sports fans and those interested in increasing their basic knowledge of PEDs."
1,Very Poor,"I am the FAN in fanatic when it comes to baseball. If there is a book, I read it. If there is a game, I watch it. If Twins's tickets are available, I am there.This is probably the worse baseball related book I have ever read. I like Will Carroll's column but he should stick with that style of writing but cause his book writing is awful. If you are looking for a book book on baseball or the subject of steroids, this sure ain't it."
5,Excellent toe tapping tunes!,"Heard the Barn Owls on Pandora Radio and immediately loved their music. Of all of the music that I own, this disc is the most down-to-earth and uplifting. Makes me want to reel."
1,Looked good in picture.....but,These are not what I thought they were going to be they look good in the picture but when I got them the quality just isn't there. I can't wear them with out completely bending the hooks out of shape. They are more like silver plastic.
1,If only this stupid game would work...,I think the video card in my PC won't let me play this game - I wish it had said something on the Amazon site to tell me that. I can't get the game to play. I may just wait until this Winter when I get a new PC.... Very disappointed - liked both the other Homeworlds a lot...
1,Do not buy this game under any circumstances.,"I have now purchased this game twice and been completely unable to get it to run properly off of CD or fully installed. I have a top-of-the-line gaming system.First disc was actually flawed and would not install at all - second purchase installed and then would not start.Even the patch download was flawed and had to be installed twice - it still does not play - and i will now return 2 full copies without ever playing the game.Support for this game is non-existent and you will receive no help at all from the company website. The do give you your money back, but save time and just don't buy it - and read up on any of their products before trusting Vivendi.Total waste of money and time."
3,homeworld 2 is the same as orb,in my view playing homeworld 2 is about the same as O.R.B if you seen that game they mirror each other both have great graphics. homworld is harder than homeworld 2 but orb is cooler because of the levels
2,Broke or something,It doesn't allow the camera to be panned like it should. Homeworld and Catalysm did camera pannaning the same way but they work.
5,great game,very good space rts game i recommend it to anyone. Overall great game and it will work on windows 7 that is great!
4,"Pretty good RTS, not for the ADHD gamers among you.","First of all, this is an older game, so it should run pretty well on most laptops out there. This may not mean anything to you guys out there with your fancy-smancy desktop rigs (with discreet graphics!), but for those of you who are grad students with crappy workstations in basement laboratories or cheap HP laptops, this means hours of fun while you're supposed to be making science happen. This isn't a fast-paced RTS, by any means, the single-player campaign develops very slowly and seems to take hours upon hours. It's also very difficult, not at all recommended for those who are new to the RTS genre. For being an old game, it still looks fantastic IMHO, and there are plenty of third-party mods available. I recommend it for LAN games with your non-FPS inclined friends and for decent gaming when you're living off student loans and would rather spend money on a ticket home than a new computer."
2,Basically a game box rail game,"I'm a big fan of both HW1 and Cataclysm. Both are enjoyable, paced well, and actually beatable.With that said, after reading many reviews here I decided to download the demo and see how bad the latest release is.Well, if you like stunning graphics and atmosphere, then it's incredible. If you want enjoyable game play and strategy, forget it.See HW2 fell off the wagon when they decided to treat it like a ""port to PC"" game. It's more like a game box rail shooter, auto-save, rampant attacks, little time to explore, gain knowledge, build. It's just point and click, shoot to kill. It got so bad I expected to get secret codes to get to the next level like a Nintendo game boy title.Sorry Relic, you should have tweaked the engine and AI and improved the graphics and stopped there. If it ain't broke don't fix it."
1,Worthless,"I was looking forward to this game, then I read the system requirements.This game requires you to have or buy a specific video card, I just upgraded to a 64 meg evil kyro and it won't even play the demo. If you have to buy a new video card every time a new game comes out to play the game then you will end up spending $150 each title instead of $50. Most people don't have the money or the knowhow to buy and install new hardware for the software they want to use. If these games keep tryint to push people to upgrade their computer then they are going to loose customers, like me. Until they put out a patch that allows this game to be played on the majority of the v-cards out there I will not be buying this game as it is worthless on my computer. I wonder how many other customers they will loose because of their idiocy?Ken"
4,"Fun, but not easy to get started.","This game is quite fun, but it often has problems starting up due to conflicts with the emualtion software on most computers. Once you get it working, however, it's awesome."
1,"Too small, lack of control, and boring","I felt like I'm controlling an ant farm. Very bad perspective. All the ships and everything are really small. Also, if you notice most ships just do their own thing, there is no real feeling of control of the game at all - it's like point ship at other ship, watch battle. Zzz .. boring. If you want a game where you can control your ship and how everything that occurs, I recommend Starscape (do a google search). The space genre just isn't fitting for an RTS - especially with a game like Homeworld 2 where everything looks like the size of an ant and is barely controllable."
3,A new space based RTS game - not at all like HW1,"Excellent AI for near real world war stratigy, good unit balance, better graphics (if you have a high end machine), excellent maps. Some of the fun things from HW1 are missing like salvage corvettes and support frigates. The missions are average, build ships - fight - lose ships - build more ships... People who like Warcraft would like the feel of HW2. Much faster paced than HW1. But as far as stratigy I could find little. In my first play thru I had to replay 2 of the 15 missions, I did not find this to be a hard game, except on a slow machine it is hard to control. The plot is there, but hard to get close to and involved with. As a sequel to HW1 it is not much like the original except in the story line continuation. Don't be disappointed by hoping for more of HW1, which it isn't. I would recommend Homeworld (1) for those that are choosing between the two."
5,If you like a challenge,Alright first off im a big stratagy gamer.This games graphics and ai are perfect. They create a stunning new look at space. But the big thing with me was the challenge of the game. If you want a big challenge in rts's you need to get this game. I tried the demo before i got it and i was stuck for a couple days figuring out the first levels. Personally if the game isn't a challenge in the single player then it won't be fun at all online. If you need a challenge grab this if you don't then don't grab this ull be crying with frustration.
3,Catered to hardcore RTS fans.,"As a casual RTS gamer I found this game too hard. There is no option to select a difficulty level in the single player campaign. I guess if you are a hardcore RTS player and a Homeworld 1 fan than this is the game for you, if you are not, be ready to spend a lot of time at beating certain missions."
1,Half a game,"This is another ""half a game"". The software is there, it loaded on my machine but NO information on how to run the game. Waste of money. I did try getting on the Forums for Homeworld 2 - I hate Forums - but the writers of the ""walk through'"" were people who have been playing earlier versions and their explanations assumed you knew all about the basics. Waste of time after a waste of money. I remember when game developers documented their games. Like Civilization 4, which had a Civipedia section that documented the workings of the game. If you want to play strategy games, which are by their nature complex, do not buy this title. There is no documentation. It is just half a game."
2,I just tried the Homeworld 2 demo,It looks and plays just like Homeworld only the atmosphere seems to be missing. The music is weak. The new captain is cold and boring. I don't see anything innovative. You can't go inside the ships. It doesn't meet the standards the original Homeworld set. Seems like they could have turned out this installment after a couple of months. What have they been doing the last four years?
4,Hopefull,"Homeworld was ""Amazing"". Cataclysm was ""Good"". This trend better not continue or I would have to give Sierra the ""Confederacy of Dunces"" award. I really loved Homeworld and what was done with that game....If you dont understand what Im saying here then I hope to God you dont work for Sierras dev. team. Your probably ""management""."
1,Way too difficult to enjoy,A game is supposed to be fun but this one is an absolute torture. Like everyone said that this game is such a frustration you will get more enjoyment from reading a phone book instead. Try an older sleeper game - Conquest: Frontier Wars. The graphics is just as good and a much more superior game.
1,Lameworld 2,"This game had so much potential but they blew it. Their idea of a smart A.I. is giving it overwelming force based on how much force you have at each senario start. Finish well they are huge, finish poorly they are smaller but still proportionally huge against you. This takes away any incentive to build your fleet which is usually one of the goals of a game.It means you are always about to die, your own skill does not gain you anything. It is sad that they could not afford a programer that could write a good A.I. It truely is Lameworld."
3,Homeworld II,"Homeworld was a tough act to follow and although HW II performed admiraly, it didnt compare to the original.they story dosnt follow the stories from either the HW or Cataclysam. the gameplay is to choped up with the storie and the gameplay is alot more linear than the original. You dont expect the sequel to a best selling game to have fewer ships, more restrictions and apparently inferior tecnology(in gameplay).The new game engien is great, but the rest of the game needs work. If they would have kept to the original story, made more ships, and had fewer restrictians this game could have been another amazing addition. but as it is, i can see why HWII didnt make a big splash."
3,Joaquin Fan,"Unless you are a die hard fan of Joaquin Phoenix, like I am, you will probably think that this is one of the top ten worst films of all time. The futuristic plot isn't too bad, but one minute the characters have a russian accent, and the next they don't. Sean Penn has about 5 minutes on screen, but has a voice over in more parts of the film.So like I said before, unless you love Joaq, don't bother buying this."
2,Don't waste your time,"Totally confused & stupid script with mediocre acting. Overall a bad movie; but I've seen worse, so I gave it 2 stars."
2,It's all about Joaquin,"Lousy story, lousy acting, lousy waste of time, but great Joaquin Phoenix eye candy."
1,Why Oh Why Can't We Give Zero Stars??,"Reviewers have been puzzling about why these fine actors agreed to do this film. I'm sure I've figured it out.[spoiler ahead]It seems clear that they must have been in some way cloned, and that the evil studio executives used their clones to act the parts.On that note...one bit of hilarity re: the clones has to be small barcode thing on their arms. They are a miracle of modern science intended to dupe the world, yet there was no way to create them without plastering their arm with a relatively large metallic ID -- very nice.Uggh. What a horrible film. The worst I've seen with a great cast since foolishly renting The Bridge of San Luis Rey. Never, ever rent this film.StevenChicago"
1,Negative 5 Stars,"This movie moves much too slowly. I could only last 40 minutes into the movie with absolutley nothing going on, no plot development whatsoever and really long shots that serve no purpose and should have been edited out. The scenes are much too ambiguous to make any sense out of them and feel too staged. You would think that if someone was running away from danger, one would tell the other person exactly what one was running away from, and not spend an afternoon in a hotel doing absolutley nothing. The Polish accents and forced speech patterns added to the annoyance factor. It's like ""Polish Wedding"" set in the future.Don't waste time on this one."
1,NO STAR,"THIS MOVIE DOES NOT DESERVE ANY STAR, I WISH WE HAD A LAW THAT IF VIDEO STORES RENT A POINTLESS, STUPID AND NONSENSE MOVIE, CUSTOMERS COULD FILE A LAWSUIT AGAINST THE STORE. I COULD BE A MILLIONER BY TOMMOROW IN THIS CASE MAYBEE BILLIONER. DEFINITLY JOKING ABOUT LAWSUIT BUT TO BE A POINTLESS ,NONSENSE AND STUPID I NEVER BEEN THIS SERIOUS ABOUT ANY MOVIE."
1,Terrible Movie,"I wish I read these reviews before I rented this terrible movie. I kept watching thinking that about 40 minutes into the flick that it was starting to get better, but they just fooled me to keep me watching the rest of the movie."
1,Why pay for this .... ?,"Apparently nobody is buying this c---p and this is how it should be. Worthless fiction about a place that doesn't exist, even if the director I'm sure may feel it is documenting something. It's only a document about his sick mind. Only in Canada we are lucky enough to be shown such total aberation, even if nobody is interested."
3,Ultra Splinter Tweezers,Purchased to replace a pair my mother-in-law bought us. These were not as fine at the end as I was looking for. Nor were they as heavy. Not sure how they will work with splinters.
4,Great Weight,"The metal is great, but the picture tricked me in to thinking I was getting a bunch of sheets. There is only one sheet of nickel, but it seems to be a great weight."
3,GOOD START but ENDING SO-SO,"Well, I would give this 3 1/2 stars if possible. It starts out very promising and it is worth reading but I think it could have been more romantic and scary. I think more with the ghost would have helped. A little predictable and you could figure out the villian pretty much. Nothing steamy to speak of but I would recommend reading it. I did enjoy it for the most part."
5,Fabulous school reading material for Thanksgiving,"Eve Bunting has managed to describe at a child's level the fear, anticipation and exhaustion that often accompanied many of our ancestors as they came to America. This book is a reminder of the people who both came before us and those that still come with hope to America.It is a beautiful, meaningful and heartwarming book to share with elementary students and families either during the Thanksgiving season or while studying history and immigration."
1,Is illegal immigration justified?,"Eve Bunting seems to hold the opinion that breaking the laws of this country can be justified. I would not read this book to my third graders. In the case of illegal immigration, the end does not justify the means. In her book, Ms. Bunting portrays a family fleeing a Cuba-like country for a Florida-like destination. After enduring a harrowing journey in a rickity, leaky boat, the family arrives in America and is greeted by their fellow countrymen in time to celebrate Thanksgiving. Sorry, but this book does not warm my heart. The problems and responsibilities thrust upon the United States by uncontrolled immigration is too serious an issue to gloss over."
4,Easy to put together and good value,Very easy to put together. I only give it four stars because the wheels move around laterally on their axles. They need extra washers or collars to prevent this.I bolted a piece of plywood to mine that was pre-cut to 2' x 4' from Home Depot but Northern Tool has a version with a plywood platform already fixed to it with a protective edge strip. I would recommend just paying the extra $ and save yourself the hassle.
5,No plans ...No problem,"I bought this kit recently to build a friend a vegetable garden on wheels. It turned out great.Understand that if you purchase this kit, you will be completely on your own as far as design and construction. However, if you have one creative bone in your body, you will be able to make something beautiful and useful, and that will last you for many many years.If you need some suggestions, go to this website: [...]You will find many suggestions on how to build the perfect wagon."
2,"works ok, likes to drift.","It works ok, but the company is a bit flaky, they offer a rebate and then doesn't accept invoices and wants you to tear up the box's to get the UPC code because they dont provide them anywhere else.I wouldn't trust a company like this again, I will buy my hand loading equipment elsewhere from now on.I just found out it doesnt line up for pistol cases."
1,Redundant and worthless,"I paid attention to the other review and got this from my library first. It is really mind blowing how mich space the author takes up to say nothing of practical value. If there is a description of attaining this ""trance zero"", I missed it. I'm glad I didn't waste the money."
1,Waste of Time,"This book is nothing but hundreds of pages of self-serving tripe. There were hundreds of in-depth descriptions of ""trances"", but nothing the average person doesn't already understand. Further, though the book proposes the ""trance zero"" state, it's only hypothetical, offering no means to obtain or experiment with this state of consciousness.I admit the author's complete lack of moral character did not help this book any- as when he rather casually describes a woman being victimized by another psychologist over a period of YEARS while she is seeing the author professionally for help. By his own words, he never helped her at all or stoppped this monster from destroying a woman's life. So much for the effectiveness of his methods.I learned nothing of practical value. Period. If you must read it, try the library first."
3,GOOD HAT BUT IT'S NOT GREEN! IT'S BLACK!,"I like the hat. Its snug, sturdy, and long enough to easily cover your ears and lower head. The hat that arrives is black and not green. Somebody else said this and they were right. It gets a three because its not dark green like I wanted."
2,"Like other reviewers said, wires too short","The site said this was as good as OEM for my Dodge Grand Caravan. Everything about it was fine except the wires are definitely at least a foot too short.Don't buy unless you don't mind splicing the wires, which is what I did. Fortunately I had crimps so it only added twenty to thirty minutes to the project, otherwise it would've meant a trip to the store."
4,The Threat Within Could it be Better?,This book is very exciting but it could use some more spice because it makes Qui Gon look like an overly protective father figure who will never let Obi Wan go out on his own but you SHOULD read it.
5,soothing serenity,"Of the many audio sources my husband and I have turned to when we need assistance with finding a peaceful state of mind and body, we both agree that this one, with its lovely blend of instruments and bells, is by far the most effective. My husband finds he can work with more focus and joy at his office when he puts this CD into his Walkman, and I use it for daytime meditation and to help me fall asleep at night."
5,Fragrance,"My husband loves this fragrance. Used to buy it at Nordstroms, but could not find this sandel wood kind lately. The company makes several different kinds of fragrances and the are all nice and last a long time. Much better than the inexpensive ones found everywhere. Also like the Ala moano (so) fragrance"
4,Surprisingly Good,"I love Lorrie Moore, but I tend to avoid second person narration. She's one of the few that pulled it off for this reader. I highly recommend this book."
4,An exciting talent.,"SELF HELP is a collection of short stories focusing on lost love and infidelity . Brilliant imagery and cleverly manipulated semantics dominate.Narrative is neglected, but not really missed.Each piece must be slowly savored, and carefully parsed.My only reservation is the ever pervasive cynicism and hopeless view of human relationships.Perhaps Moore's other work will have a wider range and more optimistic outlook. This is my first taste of Moore."
2,This book should try medication,"Maybe it was the mood I was in when I read this book, because I really loved ""Birds of America,"" but man, did this book depress me. Every single story with the exception of maybe two (""How to Have an Affair"" and ""How to be a Writer"") were so, so dark and sad - unnecessarily so, in my opinion. I couldn't even finish the story about the dying woman saying goodbye to her daughter and husband. And the story it followed was about a woman losing her loving mother to mental illness. Oh, and did I mention that the story that proceeded it was about a woman burying her mother? At that point I was just begging for mercy, geez! I threw this book away after I read it, not because I hated it or thought it was poorly written, just because I didn't want to spread its bad juju around any further."
2,Not what I expected,"I found this collection of stories to be very depressing. Lorrie More's collections of short stories are artistically done... always trying new ways of story-telling. I'm not much of a fan of her writing in general (and if you are, you will probably have a very differing opinion from mine), but I respect her boldness regarding methods of narration. Even so, I felt like I needed some serious self-help after reading the book."
5,Amazing Book,"I can't believe I just read a book written in the 2nd person, and that I was able to stick with it. What's more, I enjoyed every minute of it! Highly recommended."
5,Kept my tear ducts flowing freely,"I read this book about thirteen years ago. I was house sitting in New Orleans for a friend who had a massive library. That's when I discovered Lorrie Moore. While doing laundry on Magazine Street I started Self Help. I'd have to turn back to a previous page to wipe the tears away and compose myself. As a fairly unassuming person, I stood out even in New Orleans when I'd cackle out loud and totally lose control crying. Turn the page, compose and start over. I finally had to put the book away until I got home. Lorrie Moore has to be one of the most enjoyable writers ever."
3,Dangerously preliminary stories,"These stories are the work of a VERY young Lorrie Moore, and frankly these stories do not measure up, particularly those stories in which she writes in the third person. You can really see her striving for a poignancy which she intelligently rejects in her later work. Still interesting as the beginning of what is shaping up to be a great literary career."
3,too gimmicky!,"At first I loved these stories, with their original style and multidimensional characters--the woman dying of cancer who reveals to us that she doesn't want to die, but she won't tell her husband. In places like this Moore succedes with flying colors. However, sometimes she uses too much manipulation in her format when a story isn't strong and thereby serves the ""Self-Help"" designation before the individual piece. When she does this, a story feels gimmicky, forced and not very interesting to read. About half of the stories are still great."
2,A descent from her earlier greatness,"I used to go around buttonholing people, telling them what a great writer Lorrie Moore was...I still think her earlier story collections are terrific and would give them 5/5 stars. But this one is far from her best...beginning to sound like one endless story just chopped off in random lengths, like salami. And the one about the sick baby is disgusting and foul. If that happened to Ms. Moore in real life, I am sorry for her, but it is too intimate to write down for the public. If it is fiction, it goes too far. No mother of a seriously ill child would write cynical sentences about the other mothers in the hospital wearing sweatpants. So buy her earlier books, skip this one."
1,"Watch Out, Amy Tan","After reading the many good reviews about nearly all of Lorrie Moore's books on amazon, I went to the library and checked out Birds of America, Self-Help, Frog motel whatnot, and Anagrams. I read the first stories from Birds of American and Self-Help and was reminded that there are some truly terrible writers out there; Lorrie Moore is the worst I have read lately. She writes like some graduate student doing a theses on The Joy Luck Club while weeping and staring into the distance. But...if you happened to like the Joy Luck Club, and perhaps loved the movie Steel Magnolias - man, rush out and by everything you can find by this genius."
3,An accident. Again!?,"I'm sick of accidents. Liz and the motorbike was enough. But anyway, not very great book but read it if you like the series. I think Liz is boring. Without Jess this book (and the whole series) would suck!"
1,Typical knock off quality - junk,"Sometimes you get what you pay for....The AC adapter was cheap in price and its cheap in quality. The di-pole plug falls out of the bluetooth ear piece. You have to move around to fined the ""sweet spot"" where it will a) not fall out b) keep in contact internally so as to actually charge the device. Once in place don't touch it or it will stop charging! Don't buy it. Get an OEM power supply."
4,A call to action,A call to action and service growing out of both faith and feminist ideals. Much still needs to be done to address women's justice issues.
4,Not for little ones,"My 3 year old loves Calico Critters and this couple is adorable. The bride dress is so cute and these two have become some of her favorites. The car is so cute too...but broke within a few days. The wheels got out of allignment and then just broke off without being fixable. I also have a younger child who might have also contributed to the breakage. Probably better suited for older kids, or more careful little ones."
5,Very high quality,I first used a couple of these circuit breakers almost 5 years ago. They are very high quality and I have no doubt that they will perform as advertised if needed.
5,waterproof circuit breaker,"A little expensive for what it is, but is a good quality product. Order and delivery went without problems."
2,Picture not true to size,Opened box and saw how small this breaker is .I dont think it well hold up to marine use.I might send it back
4,Great Product works well,"This is a very nice breaker, the only complaint that I have with it is that for a smaller boat that may have a trolling motor, the unit has a set of mounting holes that may be better used to mount it on the battery box or on the holddown. Most smaller boats dont have too many places to mount this size of a screw hole without using washers. I built a bracket to adapt to the housing and then attached it to my battery strap. Functionality is great, if you have somewhere to run a large screw to mount it it is simple to install."
3,Kiss and Tail,"Wow superhead is really a poor quality individual. She is fairly triffling. Interestingdvd if you are interested in the story, definitely pick this up or rent it."
5,SEADOO BOAT STRAP,Been looking for something to replace a lost boat strap for my Seadoo Sportster Boat. It has been a real challenge but at last these worked perfectly!
5,A Great Watch,"I owned this watch for apoximately 5 years. I'm 71 years old and have had many watches but this one has been perfect. Not only does the band fit without pinching but the watch never gains or loses a second. It's so comfortable on, I wear it 24/7. The only thing I had to do was replace the battery after about 4 years. It's a great watch."
5,Classy watch,"This Seiko is a sharp looking watch. It has just enough special features to make it the best all around watch for my husband. Oh, yeah -- and it keeps accurate time, too!"
5,good but not what I thought,The book is a great beginning study of anceint Hebrew. I just misunderstood what I was ordering. I'm really looking more for a Hebrew lexicon.
1,And the Last Disappointment,Once Again...I bought this book for a friend of mine who is scholared in Hebrew. She was truly disappointed in this author's work. Would never refer it to anyone.
2,Fundamentalist Treatment in Scholarly Clothing,"I guess you really can't judge a book by its cover.I appreciate Mr. Benner's effort, as well as his forthrightness, but this is not a scholarly treatment of the subject. One of Mr. Benner's early suppositions is that since (he believes) the Tower of Babel was a literal event, then early Hebrew writing evidences that Adam and Eve, as well as God, spoke Hebrew which was not confounded at Babel. This is a striking assertion with no supporting academic material.His efforts at linking Hebrew writing with the Hebrew mentality that concentrated on action over abstract thought is a little better thought out, but that's been done before by Hebrew scholars in better books.If you're a fundamentalist Christian, then you'll probably accept what Mr. Benner has to offer. If you're interested in a more scholarly approach, or come from a branch of Christianity/Judaism that requires a less literal approach to Genesis, then you'll find this tome pretty slim pickin's."
5,{;eased,"Just seemed to take a long time to arrive, although it still was in the ""alloted time"" When you are prego, you want them right away because nausea doesn't wait. But have had these before and they certainly help."
2,Decent Choice,"I bought these for my wife as she had a lot of sickness in her pregnancy. But she didn't get much in the way of relief using these, and mostly she just got a sore mouth as using these for more than a few minutes caused her mouth to go raw.I'd look elsewhere, unless you just know that these will work for you."
3,is a good distraction from the nausea,"Here is what I have to say about preggie pops:1) It helped me distract my mind off the nausea because of its extremely sour taste.2) During the initial months, I had it almost every morning. It would help me start my day, but unfortunately, it did not prevent any vomiting3) Good thing is, I never threw up a preggie pop that I ate (unlike the zillion sandwiches, rice and other assorted food items that I have thrown up during my first trimester)"
3,There're okay,"They didn't really help my nausea and at 70 calories a pop, I'll pass on them next time I am miserable with morning sickness."
2,ACV03,"Don't waste your money on these candies - that's all that they are. The flavors are non-aversive, but the candy itself isn't going to calm anyone's nausea. Genius marketing, but silly product for desperately sick women."
2,All sugar.,"I thought these were supposed to have vitamin B in them. My MD suggested them due to my nausea, maybe I should have gotten lollipops? I got these candies, they taste good, but for the price, I may as well get something off the shelf that is just sour sugar. These have a LOT of sugar, and nothing else in them except filler. I don't see how they're for nausea, I got Halls eucalyptus sugar-free cough drops and those worked better for nausea. I would save your money, there is nothing unique about these except its marketing."
1,Too Sweet! Not for Severe Morning Sickness!,"I started having morning sickness when I was 5 weeks along and by the time I was 10 weeks the morning sickness was out of control and I couldn't tolerate the smell of most foods. I used the Preggie Pop Drops and really hoped that it would work. By the time I hit 13 weeks I had lost 15 pounds and nothing worked, not Sea-Bands, not lemon drops, not ginger, not Preggie Pops, so I had no choice but to go on Zofran. Now THAT worked like a charm! I had a sweet tooth prior to getting pregnant but as the pregnancy progressed I couldn't handle eating anything even mildly sweet because of the aftertaste it left in my mouth. So if somewhere along your pregnancy you develop an aversion to sweets then do not purchase these because they are extremely sweet and tart. I highly encourage anyone who is pregnant with severe morning sickness to consult with their health care provider before wasting any money on these type of products."
3,They work for a while.....,"...but then your body gets used to them and the taste became disgusting to me. I had a really extreme case of morning sickness/all day sickness, so I can't really give a fair review. I ended up needing medication to keep even water from coming back up!"
1,Repulsive,"I was lucky in that my morning sickness wasn't unbearable, but it was still bothersome. I got a pack of these and they were absolutely repulsive. Every flavor disgusted me and I ended up giving them away with the caveat that they made me feel much worse. I hope the person I passed them on to had a better experience than I did."
1,placebo pop drops,These candies did nothing for my pregnancy induced nausea. They may have well been a placebo. Ginger candies are more helpful in relieving this nausea.
3,"Works, but temporary.","These were actually suggested to my by a friend of my fiance's. He said his wife went through them like crazy and they really helped. What I have found is that they do work, but only for a few minutes. It's true they work better than say a peppermint candy, and the sour is more tolerable. But like any ""cure"" for morning sickness, it's very fleeting. I usually eat them when I'm in the car and couldn't run for the bathroom. I'm still searching for that miracle cure, but until then these are a help."
2,Buy Jolly Ranchers,The idea of these is to suck on them to reduce nausea. The flavors were so-so. Jolly Ranchers were cheaper and they had flavors I loved. I used Jolly Ranchers for nausea and acid reflux.
3,Did not work for me,Tasted ok but didn't really work for alleviating nausea. The only thing that worked was waiting to progress in the pregnancy. It's a tough road but eventually you feel better. :-)
5,Yummy,"To each there own. They are either going to work or wont work at all. However for me, they did work. I think they taste great too. Not too sour for me."
4,gave me relief from nausea,"I experienced nausea from ~wk 9-14 that would last pretty much all day. I tried peppermint tea, ginger ale, peptobismol.....preggie pop drops were the only thing that gave me immediate relief. There are 2 down falls to these, they can make your mouth raw if you have too many of them and their effects only last ~1 hr or so."
5,The sour flavors seem to work,"The sour flavors seem to work well. I suffer from intermittent morning sickness, and none of the other products have worked well (except sea bands do). You can get a better price elsewhere. I bought like 10 packages recently. Also, I tried Queasy Drops made by the same company, and I believe that they are the same thing. I've also tried the Organic version, and they seem to work even better and taste a little better too."
4,I think they work even if short term,"I first tried these at work when a co-worker gave me the lollipop version. Within a couple of minutes I felt better (I had been feeling tired, stomach-achy and my mouth was watering like I was going to vomit). Relief doesn't last all day but I feel it does help. I used approximately 2 - 3 a day but my symptoms are much better now that I'm in the 2nd trimester so not using them as often."
4,What a relief,"I'd finally reached the point of desperation one Saturday afternoon while out running errands. If you've ever been pregnant, you know that point. I'd heard about Preggie Pops and decided that I needed to seek them out. I'd tried gum, other hard candies, even lemon drops. These drops worked so much better than anything else that I'd tried. The only downfall of course is that if you suck too many of them, the roof of your mouth feels a bit raw. Beware, they are very sour, but tasty."
2,It is candy,I can't believe I paid 5 dollars for a few pieces of hard candy. There was no special ingredient to these other than they are organic and made from natural flavors. I was able to get a much larger bag of organic candy from the health food store for a fraction of the price. As for helping my morning sickness it didn't work any better than anything else.
2,Made my teeth ache,"Definitely eased my pregnancy nausea - they worked so well, in fact, I brought them on a road trip to help with carsickness. I sucked on three in a row, and they worked great, except afterwards my tongue and gums felt raw and my teeth ached. My teeth are still really sensitive three days later. I guess it must be from all the acid that gives them the sour taste? I probably won't use them again because it seriously hurts to chew anything now."
1,Didn't help,I didn't find that these worked. All I wanted to do was brush my teeth to get the taste out when I was done.
1,only one flavor helped me a little,"I am 5 months along, and still sick most of the day. I bought these wishing they would help. The first flavor I tried, tangerine, actually did help for a short period of time. The raspberry, made me sicker! The other two I made myself keep in my mouth, but they didn't help at all. Oh well, wishful thinking I suppose....."
2,Not so great,"I bought this product two weeks ago for morning sickness and I have found on all occasions after eating the candies, I became more sick. The sour flavor did not sit well. I would not recommend this product for relief from morning sickness."
2,Didn't Work,"The taste is ok. They make you salivate a lot, which is bad when you are nauseous. They didn't help at all with nausea."
5,Better than anything else!,"My first pregnancy I was sick almost the whole 9 months. I was told to suck on lolli pops, candies, drink Ginger ale... nothing really worked. Now that my first child is 15 months old, we are about to have another. I started to get sick and decided to try these. THESE actually work! Like someone else said previously, candies always were too sugary and made me more sick. These don't and they work almost instantly for me. I can actually cook supper without throwing up as long as I keep sucking on one. I have also tried Little Noses Saf T Pops for kids. (I think that is their name,) I had bought them for my son and was waiting on these Preggie pops to arrive and those work fairly well too. (I am assuming it is due to low sugar content?) The Little Noses pops were actually designed for a safe 'cough drop' for kids, with a sucker handle.I love these Preggie Pop Drops and will be ordering a full supply for this pregnancy and as gifts!!"
3,Preggy Pop Drops,Drops were ok. They eased my nausea a little but I got terribly bored with the flavors. The manufacturer only put 2 green apple drops in the whole container. Most of the drops were the lemon and tangerine. They skimmed BIG time on the raspberry and the apple.
5,Perfect,"Like other reviewers, I too have had no luck with the pressure bands or ginger candy, ale, tea, etc. I had to find something because my morning sickness is strong from the time I wake until I'm back asleep. So far this is the only thing that has helped me. I don't know what the special blend of essential oils is, but that must be the key to what makes these so effective. I've already ordered 4 packs of the drops and 1 pack of the pops, but I definitely prefer the drops."
1,Doesn't help.,It didn't help me even a little. In fact at times It made me feel a little sicker. It was a waste of money and I was very disappointed.
1,Didn't work for morning sickness,"I bought this product after reading the reviews, but unfortunately was a waste of time and money. These are pricey ineffective drops. They are very sour and I felt worse after having them."
2,It might be that they were sour,I didn't notice any benefit from these but it may be that they were incredibly sour and I don't particularly like sour so it was a struggle to eat them.
2,Did not help,My wife had horrific nausea and vomiting until the mid second trimester. She had aversion to this product and could barely stomach it. I'm sure this may work for some with more mild morning sickness but for severe sickness I found absolutely no product worked whatsoever for my wife(I bought her everything) other than strawberries and slurpees...
1,This didn't work for me.,"In desperation to cure myself of 24/7 Morning sickness, I tried this product. I didn't find it anymore helpful than sucking on any other hard piece of candy."
1,did not work for us,"Bought this product based on the positive reviews; however, it didn't work for my wife. To be fair, nothing worked including ginger ale, ginger candy, sour candy, ginger tea, seabands. The only thing that worked was eating food."
4,"yummy, but not perfect",These didn't work for me when my morning sickness was at it's worst...but nothing really did. These helped calm my tummy when I was having mild bouts of queasy tummy. I liked them because I could toss them in my purse easily.
2,Same as any candy,"Although these candies may be considered slightly more nutritious than other candies I don't think they did anything that any other hard candy, such as a jolly rancher, would have done. It's nice when you suffer from morning sickness to have something to suck on but I would have preferred that it be a lot more sour than these were. For the price I would either buy a bag of jolly ranchers or look for candy at your local health for store that doesn't contain high fructose corn syrup. These just weren't anything special."
5,Every Expectant Mother needs these!,"These little things have turned out to be a godsend. I have been nauseous for the better part of a month and these really seem to cut down on that when the sick feeling gets too overwhelming. They have a great flavor, a bit sour but not overpowering. They come in several different flavors and I find all to be pleasant. I will be buying more of these without a doubt!"
3,"Taste good, but don't really help - what does?","I bought these hoping my nausea would be curbed by them. They taste like candy. But I was still sick after eating them. I don't know what really helps morning sickness. I had nausea, especially in the evenings, for at least 3 months. I found that better than this product, ginger ale (made with real ginger) and ginger drop candy worked a little better. Honestly, I didn't even care that the ginger candy didn't taste as good as the Preggie pops because it worked better. And, the ginger is much cheaper and easier to find than these are. They sell them at Motherhood stores if you want your preggie pops sooner than the shipping takes."
5,Work well,"These arrived fast and the container fits into my purse without opening and spilling everywhere. The lemon makes my mouth numb so I avoid lemon. The others work well. I found Lemonheads to work just as well. I've had morning sickness for 9 weeks so far and these and Lemonheads have kept me on my feet and able to run errands. These aren't miracle cures, but it does help."
3,I only liked the lemon,I really only liked the lemon ones. They had a mildy soothing effect on the nausea. Only lasted as long as the candy though. All the other flavors made me feel even more nauseated. I am sure if I wasn't pregnant all the flavors would taste good to me. But with the pregnancy I only liked the lemon. I tried really hard to find a Preggie Pops pack that ONLY had lemon. No dice. They have several flavors offered with only a single flavor but not lemon. They should offer each flavor as a separate Item for purchase. I just couldn't bring myself to order any more packs when I was only going to eat a quarter of it.
5,These really work ! Worth every penny !,"My wife got these from a recommendation from one of her doula friends. I didn't believe it at first, but then saw that they really work. When she feels like puking, she simply pops one of these and is fine. Its like magic ! I would pay 10 times for these things !!!! If you are in doubt, I would recommend trying them, they do work."
2,It's just candy.,"Seriously. Just candy, with a cute name and expensive packaging.Yes I liked the flavors. Yes many nausea products rely on sugars to soothe the stomach. MAYBE rice syrup is marginally better as a sugar than high fructose corn syrup.But I found these had zero impact on nausea, and therefore zero upside to the sugar. If I needed a sugar solution to the morning sickness, good old cola syrup or Nausene did me more good.The best thing I could say about them is, the guys in the office didn't get into my candy!"
3,not professional packaging,The packaging consisted of a box with newspaper inside. I didnt think the packaging was very professsional.
5,Great Balkan Music Sampler!,"This cd is great sampling of Balkan Music and a great place to start if you want to take a quick musical tour of the Balkans and hear what appeals to you. I particularly liked the Romanian piece and want to learn more about that country's music. The CD was created and produced by members of the Eastern European Folk Life center, eefc.org, which promotes Balkan music in North America. Try it, you won't be disappointed! ---Riccardo"
4,Pretty Good Listen,"Overall about what i expected, sound quality is good, but nothing super and typical of the era, song selection is nice, overall no complaints."
5,Cutting-edge insights into this painful disorder.,"In this complicated age of both depression and seasonal illnesses it is most refreshing to read a book that is both clear,consise, and informative and hopeful. As many people approach the darkness of day lights saving time this weekend it is hardening to read such and encouraging book."
2,Didn't like this flavor at all.,I am a big Zoe bar fan but I find that the apple flavor is too fake. My 4yo liked it but noone else in the family did. Stick with the pb and chocolate one..
1,"Awful, do not buy",This feels so cheap. Terrible quality. The top doesn't attach tightly...it wiggles around. If you held it upside it would fall off. This looks like someone bought a cheap can on sale at the dollar store and resold it for way to much money. I don't believe it's 18/10.
5,The best resource for JDBC users,"This book contains everything you need to create either simple or very complex database applications written in Java - a short introduction to relational databases and SQL language, very nice and understandable JDBC tutorial, complete reference manual of all JDBC 2.0 classes and methods, and several good examples how to use JDBC features in your applications.Actually, I would appreciate more detailed description of using distributed transactions, relation between JDBC and JTA and using EJB database components but the main purpose of this book is to cover the most common features of JDBC API - and this goal is definitely fulfilled."
3,Okay,"I tan on a regular basis so I thought I would get my own goggles to always have on hand. The ones at my tanning salon seem a little too clear like they wouldn't really protect your eyes. I got these ones and have used them a few times now. They seem a little ill fitting since you can see light above, below, and on both sides. I feel like they are not that protective since all that light shines through. Looking straight ahead they seem to really protect your eyes and shield them from the uv rays but I still worry about all four sides being exposed."
2,Super Sunnies not what I'd hoped for,"I ordered these as part of a 8 week LED light treatment I'm having to take daily. The lights are quite bright and blink twice a second which is uncomfortable even with my eyes closed. First, the Super Sunnies that arrived were not black or red like the photo but hot pink; my least favorite color and not something I really want to be seen wearing. Second, they're rather narrow for my eye distant. And last and most frustrating is that they don't block out nearly as much light as I had expected. My regular pair of sunglasses do better! The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is that my sister said she could use them."
5,Love it,The items arrived exactly how they were advertised. The items arrived promptly- great product-- I would recommend to anyone who tans!
3,Cheap but does the trick,"I mean, theres not much else to say. I bought them cuz they were the cheapest ones on here. They do exactly what they are meant to."
2,What light through yonder window breaks.......,Too small. The light is NOT shielded from my eyes. I can't use them and I have to use the Community pair.
5,An old departed friend,I could hear her voice with every written word.Miss you Cynthia-keep them on their toes in heaven.If you saw what passed for writing now you'd let them have it!Highly recommend for all who find life interesting.
1,Beware if you order this book,"Beware if you order this book, that it is a workbook companion tothe hardcover. It's not clear when you read the description. Ihave no real opinion since I though it was a text and I have noneed for a workbook, but I had to enter some star rating"
5,extremely versatile,"Nguyen Le is extremely versatile, from Funk to Rock, Jazz/Fusion to World. It is a pleasure listening to this album because the spectrum of music/techniques change from song to song. His techniques combine many styles unlike other vituosos with somewhat signatory chops eg. abstract (John McLaughlin) subtle (Pat Metheny) rapid (Al Di Meola) rocky (Van Halen) emotional (Santana) intense (Jeff Beck) etc. He uses the tremolo bar to retaine micro-tones (the between-notes) which are some of the distinctions and characteristics unique to Vietnamese Music. In this album, his licks are simple but the essence of his music/sound is far more telling. It is quite evident that music and breathing are one and the same for Nguyen Le."
1,A JOKE,RUBBISH!!! THIS IS NOT 'WORLD MUSIC' THIS IS A FEW VIETNEMESE INSTRUMENTS MIXED WITH WESTERN NSTRUMENTS DONE LARGELY IN THE WESTERN STYLE OF POP MIDDLE OF THE ROAD MASQUERADING AS TRADITIONAL VIETNAMESE.
4,Artful Style,"If your tastes run to dread, decay, and decomposition, then this is your kind of book. Vandemeer's prose makes bile taste sweet - his poet's voice renders a bleak, surrealistic world inviting.The stories are connected in a dreamlike fashion. In one dream you may feel you battle the divine, but then you slip into a familiar scene of family, loss, or love - but the melancholic background remains the same.His style is wonderful - there were times I reread a passage for the wonderful delight it provided. And that's the rub. Style trumps substance in this wonderful world of woe, friends, love, doubt, and menace.I ultimately found I didn't care for any of the characters, but I did enjoy reading the passages that described them, their world, and their struggle."
4,Excellent dark nightmare...,"I really like they way the author wrote the book, in the perspective of three different characters. It's not often you find a book that creeps you out in the way this book does, I mean a head of a bio-engineered animal glued to a dinner plate? How cool is that!!!It's dark, and it's both sad and humorous at the same time and some of the very best imagery I've ever encountered. I would agree with another reviewer saying that you have to stick with it a bit. If you can forge your way into the 20-30 page region, it will grasp you and you'll be the one hanging on for dear life after that..."
5,Holy homicidal meerkats!,"Veniss Underground is one of those books that makes you think about it long after you've read the last word. Vandermeer's prose is astonishingly good, and even though the novel is on the slim side, it packs in so much phantasmagoric detail that you'll swear you've read something twice as long. Vandermeer's style is Gene Wolfe mixed with Samuel Delany and a dash of Hieronymous Bosch added. Simply phenomenal. I definitely see this making some award lists next year. I'm still out of breath, two months after putting it down."
2,Pass.,"I give up. I tried and tried to get into this - I liked the first part (Nicholas) but could not get past (or into) his sister (Nicola) and the shift in perspectives to 3 main chars - and it's creepy - not in a good way (to me). It's too bad, I usually like dark, dystopian, surrealistic stuff - no go here."
2,Unnecessarily Deep,"I like VanderMeer, but this was less than I expected of him. It needed some more editing, for starters; the whole thing had an unpolished quality to it. Secondly, it felt rushed. Large portions of what would have been good story were entirely skipped over. Characters who would have been interesting were left by the wayside.Read CITY OF SAINTS AND MADMEN instead."
3,Mediocre,"The writing was mediocre. The story idea is not original, but could be quite interesting regardless...but like I said the writing wasn't all that great. The only interesting story was about a destroyed city and a small civilzations attempt to recreate it and the ensuing trouble. This was written fairly well with interesting characters and fantastical creations."
3,A bit dated,"If nothing else this disk should be recognized for one thing many people seem to overlook; it contains the world's first Rap Tune, ""Trouble Every Day"""
2,Great for 1966- poor for now,"Okay, this was a pretty wild debut album in 1966. While everyone was listening to British pop with sentimental themes of teenage love, these Americans released a sarcastic, political, noise filled double album which was all over the place and proclaimed Zappa a talent with acute intelligence. ""Trouble comes everyday"" is the David Bowie ""Rebel, Rebel"" riff/hook ten years before Bowie but while Bowie sings of drag queens, Zappa is singing about race riots in the streets. The rest of the album does not hold up well and has aged poorly. The sound is poor and many of the pieces sound sophomoric today. So, who should buy this? If you are just getting into the Mothers of Invention, this is a must but everyone else can pass it up as a time piece that is unnecessary to add to your collection."
1,"Help, I'm A Rock","This CD is worth buying just to have the timeless classic hit ""Help, I'm A Rock"". Also includes a Suzy Creamcheese cameo."
5,Wicked! & Trippy,"Every Song is great, the most psychedelic track I think is Who Are The Brain Police? although most would say Return Of The Son Monster Magnet. Wowie Zowie is like a 40's barber shop song which is like a children's song it's fun. Hurngry Fraks Daddy is off the hook too wow!Anyway The Wind Blows"
4,"Great music, not so great sound.","The Mother's first album is great as everyone who has heard it knows, but the transfer to CD could have been much better. Compared to the original vinyl version, the sound is uneven. Frank's guitar is so much more prominent on the vinyl version of Hungry Freaks, Daddy, for example. Some songs sound as good as on the vinyl, but others do not. But then, I think the original master tape of the album was in poor condition to begin with, thanks to Verve-MGM's storage of it in a warehouse or somewhere. It would be nice to get a remastered and remixed version of ""Freak Out!"" for all to enjoy."
5,Beginning of a great adventure,"Start your career with a double album and never look back. This album deserves a plce in any music lover's collection (and will probably make the rest look silly by comparison). The one that started at all and still means a lot to me. Not everybody in the 60 was an idealistic druggy hippy... The bands Zappa played with got better, but the statements made here carry a lot of weight."
2,Got it for one song,Most of the songs are overly indulgent brain damaged 60's disposible crap.Got this for one great song (Trouble every day). Didn't like any of the other songs.
5,Freak Out! Its a Great CD!,Even though this is Zappa's first album I think its one of his best. FZ will never leave you not wondering what he meant in the lyrics of the songs. Sometimes its hard to figure out what he means in the songs and it will make you listen to the song over and over again to understand what he's saying. I think by doing that its made me a bigger fan everytime by hearing his music over and over again.
5,High Quality & Made in America,"I've used other Estwing hammers for years in various phases of construction.Now I'm welding and I was in need of a good quality chipping hammer.Estwing delivered with the E3-WC.This Estwing Chipping Hammer is very high quality, well balanced, and very sharp. I doubt I'll kill this one like I have the last 2 cheap @$$ chinese made chipping hammers I had. I have to add, 99.9% of the chipping hammers out there on the market are pure junk. But not this one. This Estwing chipping hammer is made out of the same high strength tool steel that their other hammers are made out of. One piece construction, meaning the head and handle shaft are one piece (so the head won't fly off like other hammers I've used). This hammer also has the same Estwing style handle I'm used to with their other hammers (like the 16 and 20oz. carpenters hammers).Added bonus, it's MADE IN AMERICA!!"
4,Nice,"I would have given all but when I purchased it I didn't realize that both ends were sharp, I would have liked a blunt end. But it still gets the job done good enough."
1,Lasted 4 months,"We were tired of cheap phones with fuzzy reception, so we wanted a top-quality phone with a lot of clarity. We sure didn't get it here. First off, it's not the clarity one would expect from a 2.4 GHz phone and the answering machine's quality is even worse. The answering machine features are not very user-friendly. I would like to be able to save certain messages and delete others - but it's all or nothing. Looking up saved numbers is not user-friendly, either. Panasonic's customer service on their website leaves much to be desired - all I want to know is if the phone is still in warranty. I don't have to wait in a phone queue, then pay to ship the phone to another state...."
3,good mat... but too heavy,"My husband bought this mat for it's thickness, since he practices plyometrics and needed the extra cushion. It is nice and thick, but the surface is far too slick to use for traditional yoga. I took it to a power yoga class tonight and I was sliding all over the place. It is also very heavy and it is too big to fit into standard mat bags. It feels like it is made from tire rubber, only without the tread."
2,Don't stand behind their product,About six months ago I bought a purpleLite mat (85 inches) and was happy until part of it came off the mat. I called the company and they stated that they would not deal with me because I purchased it from Amazon. Then Amzon told me they would not replace the mat. Now I'm stuck with a mat that is falling apart. Buyer beware!!!
1,Not worth it (anything),"Yet another example of expensive crap pushed by slick marketing. Brazenly advertised as ""slip resistant, even when wet from perspiration"" this mat turns into a skating rink with the first drop of sweat. Just notice how much discussion on fighting ""slippage"" is on Manduka's own web-page (the FAQ section for instance). Unabashed, they continue to both promote their ""non-slipping"" product and suggest that slipping is actually good for building your core. Watch out - people with no shame. Don't waste your money!"
1,not a very nice title,"I am a family therapist always on the lookout for good books to recommend for families. If I were to recommend this book, which I would not, it is full of grammatical errors, I would tell parents to hide it from their children. Imagine a child finding this book about 'hopeless' children; a very heavy label for a child."
5,The Book That tells the Real Facts!,"This author has hit the nail on the head with PI kids. he has tons of expertise and knows institutionalized kids. We have raised many, and all these other ' books "" are clueless. All the critics obviously have never been hit, kicked, assaulted or attacked. this straight-forward, safe and comprehensive book and family plan is a must for all parents having the toughest kids. Finally, someone tells the truth vs fairy tales that "" time will heal all wounds"", or "" these children do not need safety restraints"" ( while they are attacking you). Reading the critique by "" reviewer"" made it clear they have NO CLUE about troubled children. The one who said "" Not A Nice Title "" should worry more about content vs a Title, as most of us with tough kids have felt "" hopeless "" on more than one ocassion."
5,"This Is a ""Must Read"" For All Families Ready To Give Up!!","After struggling with our 2 Russian-adopted children who were diagnosed with every psychiatric disorder known to mankind, and also being involved in every different type of treatment(including ""attachment therapy"" by trained ""Evergreen People""), we had just about given up. All the standard diagnoses: RAD/ODD/ADHD/LD with never a treatment plan that made sense. Just drugs and more non-productive therapy. This book was referred to us by many and gave us HOPE and INSPIRATION. It sure was tough to complete the ""praogram"", but we made more progress in six months, than in years of all these therapies by all these ""experts"" who missed the boat entirely. This program Dr. Federici developed began from tough to the most compassionate and reconstructive. Please read before ""giving up""."
1,Concerns about methods,"This self-published book advises parents to use highly authoritarian parenting methods and a form of prone restraint to enforce parental commands that is potentially lethal -- and appears to be quite painful, as well.For concerning quotes from this book, see:[...]As negative reviews of this book are routinely removed from this site, I would like to state that I am not a mental health therapist and am in no way in competition with the author."
5,Best CD Representing the mid 90's,"My friends and I used to DJ college parties and just put this CD in our system and let it play, allowing us to party without having to work. It is seamlessly mixed so that you don't know when one song ends and the next one begins. When the CD ended, we just played it over and no one even knew. The only lame part about this mix is that it is all clean lyrics."
2,Not originals - new versions,"I had been missing my Canadian rock so I ordered Greatest Hits. I was disappointed. It was new versions of Patio Lanterns, All We Are and Lager and Ale. Not that they are all bad, but I wanted the actual hits, not live versions or re-recordings."
2,Just for learning how to sew a basic cushion,"When I decided to order this book, I presumed that I will find lots of ideas for cushion designs.To my dismay, it only explains how to sew some of the basic known designs of cushions without offering any new ideas.If you just want to learn how to sew a cushion, this book is suitable, otherwise, you will be better off buying normal decor books for new ideas."
5,Excellent Resource,Excellent and comprehensive! A must have for any serious job seeker. Tons of helpful information in succinct easy to use format.
4,A mission statement to my Curriculam Vitae,"I am mature self motivated individual who is seeking a permanent position with your organisation. I am vibrant, ambitious and an outgoing person. I am a responsible person who enjoys challenges and enters every taks or project with 200% of my concentration and devotion. I am presently employed / unemployed and would appreciate the opportunity to be interviewed by you, once you have persued through my C.V. I am a honest and reliable and prepared to work odd hours if necessary. I am willing to learn any tasks thatis offered in return for a negotiable salary. I look forward to hearing from you, and possibly meeting you where you can judge my abilities on a more personal basis."
5,Be Smarter than Socrates,Isn't it amazing that for hundreds of years no one thought about creative thinking till de bono and lateral thinking came along.
2,Lateral Thinking - Edward de Bono,This book is more like cognitive training manual. It explains some techniques about how to open up your thought processes to get better results. It is more like a book for school teachers rather than general reader.
5,Must Read for Teachers,"Edward de Bono's text is a must read for teachers who wish to foster independent thinking in their students and show them that seeing problems in new ways can lead to creative, worthwhile solutions."
3,A good workout for the brain!,"This book is good for reading if you want to use your brain. It is not very good if you are not working with other people, because you generally need a narrator or you'd have to look in the back which would be cheating. The Wally tests are very tricky but fun to do. The puzzles escalate from the beginning to as easy to challenging at the end. These puzzles are very well composed, and I'd reccomend them for those out there that really like to think hard. If you don't like thinking hard this is not the best choice in books, but if you do it's excellent. There are other lateral thinking puzzles too, if you enjoyed this one (that is assuming you've read it). The reason I gave it a six is because it isn't really a book, like a novel, but filled with little mysteries. The last puzzle is always the very hardest."
1,Not what I thought it would be and VERY boring!,"Lateral Thinking must have gotten all of these great reviews from teachers that want their classes to learn these techniques because it was terrible! Maybe I was expectin too much, but this was geared toward teaching kids the authors own ideas of how to practice learning a way to think besides a traditional problem-solving way. I do agree that lateral thinkin is important and should be learned in addition to vertical thinking, but why is this book so great? I almost lost it when he starts talking about ""po"". I want my money back! Only buy this if you are a teacher and you want your students to learn his way. This audio book was not what I thought it would be and it was VERY boring!"
1,I was really disappointed,"I was really disappointed with this book, it wasn't like I expected, the way it is written is really boring and time consuming. It is intended for teachers who want to learn how to teach his way, I thought it would enhance lateral thinking, instead it enhances teaching techniques."
4,A start for continous improvement,"""Do not limit your mind, don't assume"" could be a brief summary of the book. The author has made quite a good start, explanining how new ideas could be formed and how the best looking idea may not be the best to pick up. The book would be useful for people who have been in a stable environment, a place where improvements are seen as threats so you couldn't improve most of the things. The negative side was, that there were to many repeats of the same idea through out the chapter and the book. That was a bit boring. The ""PO"" word is a good idea, but doesn't need that much explanation. I would recommend it for starters in continuous improvement concept."
3,Interesting Subject and Approach,"This book was recommended to me because I was impressed with Ackoff's ""The Art of Problem Solving."" Enduring all 300 pages of this poorly written, repetitious work is proof that just because the subject matter is interesting, any given coverage of it will not necessarily be so. The book does have some merit and a few original ideas. That's part of the reason it has endured. The other reason is that the author, being so prolific, has kept himself current. Last but not least, the field of ""creativity in thought"" has so few good, logical authors with descriptive talent."
3,"Good Crunch, bland taste","These chips are nice and crisp with out being too hard. The taste is somewhat bland and does not taste much like parmesan, but it they still make for a decent snack."
2,Not the Protein chips I ordered,"I ordered the ""Better Balance"" Protein chips that were shown in the picture. When I opened my shipment it was for a different type of protein chip that does not taste nearly as good. Very dissapointed!!"
4,"I like these, plenty of flavor...","I'm sure there's more sodium than I need, but if you don't like the taste you're less likely to eat these and grab something really bad instead. I'll take the trade off and drink more water instead. It's not Doritos, but it's a healthy single serving alternative and a break from less flavorful alternatives..."
4,Good Protien snack,"I am pregnancy and gluten free so i was looking for a good crunchy snack to much on during the day. I will have to say i was pleasantly surprised by these chips. They taste pretty good and the stats are good with those of protien, no gluten and low in fat. I am going to try the other flavors."
4,Yum,Tasty and crispy. Not too crunchy and not too salty. Good chip option that you don't have to feel guilty about. I love these with my afternoon protein shake!
4,Good for gluten free,"I like the flavor of these chips. They did seem to leave a bit of a film taste in my mouth when I was finished eating them but if I chewed a piece of gum, the problem was gone. I think these are pretty good for gluten free. They are good to keep in the car and at school for a quick pick me up snack."
2,OK but not as good as the big bags.,I bought this same product in a health food store in bigger bags... BUT I guess it was not the same in the smaller bags. They were called Parmesan Chips but they were not as crunchy and they were full of parmesan. There was almost too much parmesan on the chips in these smaller bags and it seemed as though at least 1/4 the bag is parmesan. They just were not as good as the bigger bag. Maybe it was a manufacturing error... but I will not buy them again. I really wanted them for a protein supplement to my snaks. OH WELL.If someone gets these and they are crunchy then I really would like to know that.
2,Really not that good,"Saw the bunch of 5 star reviews and thought I'd give these a try. So people complained about it being salty, but that wasn't the problem for me, since really, potato chips are just as salty as these. I think someone else called this taste ""unnatural"", and that pretty much tells the story. These chips taste like they were manufactured in a laboratory, and not actually the product of natural consumables. They look like corn chips but they seriously just taste like flavoring and oil and basically empty of flavor besides these. Not recommended."
1,Not consumable,"Worst protein product ever. It was impossible to get down 2 chips. It turns into cement right away in your teeth. Stay away, you are better off with the most vile protein powder instead of this product."
3,"Hmmm, where do I begin?","These are weird little chips. They are nice and crunchy. The flavor is OK... but not good. The bags have 1.5 servings in them (so if you eat the whole bag they are 21 carbs; not 14). I doubt I will buy them again, but I will eat the rest of the carton."
1,Not a picky eater but EWWWW,"Honestly, at first they tasted good, but after the second bag the taste was unbearable! My buddy who eats just about anything couldn't even finish a bag! haha. I don't know how these other people are eating these, but this product is not what I would want to eat. Also, there are 1.5 servings per little bag FYI (i.e. not much protein and fairly caloric- much much better off buying protein powder or eating chicken). I hate to bash this product, but I feel like I wasted my money on this one."
1,gross,"Not a fan of the taste or texture. I'm a pretty clean eater, but I do like GF healthy snacks. This sounded great but it is so not. Tasted stale, the texture of cardboard when chewed and powdery ''parmesan'' flavor that has a bad aftertaste, leaving you with not only a bad taste but bad breath. Ate 2 chips and threw them all away. Pass."
1,disappointed,"We have ordered these in the past and they were great. You could eat these for a high protein snack and not even gain weight. These do not taste the same as before, I do not know if they have changed something - but these are disappointing to say the least. I don't know if we will take a chance and order them again and hope this was just a fluke or not."
2,"New formula - Texture STALE, many CRUMBS, downsized to 1.2 ounces.","I bought this product before they reformulated it, and of course now. This product has definitely changed for the worse. The texture is not crispy at all, and even borders on tasting stale. There were many crumbs in the bag, and the package has been downsized from 1.5 ounces to 1.2 ounces. Not much to like here anymore. I will be removing it from my subscribe and save. What a disappointment, because I really did enjoy them before.I am not allowed to review them independently but, there are several flavors if this product. At this time the Lemon Herb is still 1.5 ounces and the original formula. This could change at any time. I ordered another 12 pack of them before that formula also inevitably changes - they were terrific.C'est la vie"
1,etible,I did not like these very much as a snack. I do think they might be good as a salad topping though.
4,Pretty good snack,"I had weight loss surgery (Sleeve) so always looking for high protein foods. This chip is pretty good though I admit I don't eat them that often. My husband and son like them too so that says a lot! It's a good snack to have around for that ""crispy fix""."
2,Should just be called Chili Chips,"While high in protein, Kay's Natural Chili Nacho Cheese Protein Chips should just be called Kay's Natural Chili Protein Chips as their is no nacho cheese flavor found in the chips. While I did eat these because I am trying to increase my protein intake, I was disappointed with the misrepresentation of the flavor."
2,Decent alternative but not great.,"These chips taste okay - although I probably would have liked the Nacho flavor better, they were 3 dollars more a case at the time I made my purchase. The main problem with these chips, is half of every bag is protein powder at the bottom of the bag, so your stuck trying to scoop it up with your fingers or end up just throwing it out. I guess, in trying to make them low fat, the oils that usually hold chips together is missing, so you end up with half a bag of crumbs. I ordered 3 cases and every bag is like this, so I don't believe it's an isolated problem."
4,"Good taste, yet very healthy",These are an excellent snack when it comes to health. Great source of protein with healthy fibers. Highly recommended for anyone who looks into nutritional labels when eating.
2,Decent nutrition. Unnatural taste.,"First, these bags are 1.5 servings, so adjust the calories accordingly. They tasted a bit greasy and the flavor was bearable."
4,Good and good for you!,"These snack chips are good. I needed to increase my protein intake and these will help considerably, plus they taste good."
1,Horrible,These taste horrible. As a diabetic it is difficult enough to find foods that I enjoy but these are disgusting. I couldn't even pass them onto my 15 yr old vacuum cleaner of a son.
2,Don't eat after best buy date!,"Bought a bag of these today at a local Walgreen's. I like the parmesan version so thought these might be good. I was totally grossed out on the first bite: bitter and rancid tasting. Ugh. Checked the date and saw they expired a month ago. In my experience most packaged foods like this don't get that bad so soon after the package date, but man, these were SO bad I went back and told an employee at Walgreen's. They let me return it for the parmesan ones, which were fine.I'm not sure I'll try the chili cheese again, as they left a really nasty taste/memory."
3,An acquired taste,This snack is an acquired taste and I just couldnt get my taste buds to enjoy them. I will not purchase them again.
2,TOO SALTY!!!,"If you are all about eating salt covered chips, you'll be OK. For people who don't like the taste of salt poured in their mouth. Might want to move on. The flavor would be ok, with a less salt flavor. Part of the salty flavor probably comes from the cheese, but it's just too much. Won't be buying these again."
1,Not so good,These protein chips taste like eating cardboard. I would not purchase them again and even discarded most of them. It was a total waste of my money. Would not recommend.
1,Saw dust favor,Thsi are hard to eat...taste like you are getting saw dust. Never would buy these again. The birds do like them.
1,echhhhhhhhh,"I am anxious to find salted/cheese flavored snacks.....well the salt/grated cheese shakers are a lot more appealing. The aftertaste may send you right for the Hershey bar. There is also a funky stomache feeling too. I was desperate enough to try this stuff twice (I did have a box of 12)....it wasn't the result of a bad first impression, these chips are just awful....."
4,"If you're on a diet,,,be careful!","These are really good,,,,too good,,,dangerous for us dieters. The 5 oz bag is not very big, it is very easy to eat the whole bag if you aren't careful. And with a serving size only being 1 ounce, that's 550 calories. High in protien and very satisfying crunch factor."
1,Avoid this product,"This is the first product I have ever reviewed. I shop a lot on Amazon and rely on reviews and they have always helped me. This product is so bad, that I felt I had to warn others. I purchased it looking for healthy low fat snack. First off, the package says low fat. They may be low fat, but the chip is as greasy as they come. Next, the chip has no snap too it. It is soft and melts. Not something you want in a chip. Worst of all is the taste. The cheese flavor is prominent but nasty. Overall, avoid this product. I should have been tipped off by the price, which is fairly low for a supposedly healthy and gluten free product in this quantity."
3,A little too much flavor,"These things are good when you eat a few, but it's a little hard for me to finish an entire bag since they're so full of flavor (salt, herbs, etc). I have an entire drawer of them and am always reluctant to grab a bag for lunch since I don't really look forward to a mouthful of flavor. I was hoping they'd be a little more subtle like Cheezits (spelling?). This would be good for people who like a ton of flavor, but other than that, you probably won't like them enough to eat all of them."
3,seems strained,"I like it ok, but why the back-up singers?, not needed at all, ruins it, the whole album seems forced, it isn't loose like, say, in the Wooden Nickel era, I guess you can't go home after all, some of the songs don't seem to fit, o'well, I guess I should be happy they got together at all, Jim Schwall still is ""Mr. Slowhand"", Corky sounds great, maybe it will grow on me."
1,Doesn't live up to its description,"I bought this tape and was extremely disappointed. I found this ""workout"" very boring and awkward. The instructor has a super-lean, flexible body (I wonder what she used to get that way, because there's no way it could have been this tape). She tries to be encouraging. I don't see how anybody could consider this exercise."
2,"Difficult and time consuming, not for beginners.","I was interested in a work out that would lengthen muscles as The Method boasts of. However, I found many of the excercises difficult to complete, and straining the neck.The entire tape focusses on the lower body abs, thighs, and back side. The first part of the tape is 15 minutes, focussing mostly on abs. The second part is 30 minutes which begins with a repeat of the first ssection, then goes on to a focuss on the legs. I feel 45 minutes is a lot of time invested in toning without working out the upper body.I do enjoy the leg work out and have used parts of the ab and the entire leg work out in my usual toning routine."
5,Method to her madness,"This is without a doubt...the best video I have ever bought! Jennifer Kries is a very good instructor. I sweat more doing this 45 minute tape, than ridding the stationary bike for an hour. Through my own experiance, you MUST regularly do this tape for at least 2 months before you will REALLY see results. I think I spent the first 2 months mastering the different moves. Then when I had done so...I could start concentrating on feeling the burn in my muscles. This tape WILL change the shape of your body...and you will see a difference, but you must stick with it. The Method Precision Sculpting video is also really good. I have been incorporating both tapes into my routine...and seeing the results I want."
4,great video,"I found this tape to be a refreshing change from the aerobics and yoga videos I normally use. The exercises were very interesting and challenging and never made me feel bored. I noticed results after a few sessions. I felt taller and stronger and even more flexible. My only complaint is that the tape is marketed for beginners, too, and I was a beginner and found some of the moves a bit difficult at first. However, if you stick with it, as Jennifer says in the video, you will notice results in a few sessions. I have pretty weak abs, but after a few times I mastered the ab exercises which I thought would never happen! I was pretty sore the day after I did the tape the first time, so be warned if you have out of shape abs. Jennifer is a great instructor and not at all annoying!"
5,Amazing intro to Pilates!,"I just have to gush about this video! I've purchased a few exercise videos, and found them to be disappointingly ""cheesy"". But what to do when my schedule doesn't allow me to go to classes and I need a little outside motivation??This video is, hands down, the best exercise video ever. I would unhesitatingly recommend it to anyone who wants to tone and strenthen their core muscles.Jennifer Kries gets an A+++ for a thoroughly intelligent presentation. While 'The Method' is not strictly Pilates, it incorporates a huge amount of Pilates mat work. I think that Pilates exercises are very difficult to learn. She manages to succinctly describe how to perform the movements - in fact so well, that you could just listen and not have to look at the screeen. She is amazingly fit and beautiful, with a warm presence. This tape is inspiring."
4,Definitely a challenge!,"This video is really difficult when you first start to do it, but it does get easier if you are faithful. The exercises will be particularly tough if you have never tried Pilates before. I am a huge fan of Jennifer Kries, she is by far one of the best fitness instructors out there. My tape consists of two workouts, one is approximately 15 minutes long and the second one is 45 minutes. I mention this only because the editorial review says that the second workout is 30 minutes long. I wish it were! Still, this video is very effective. The day after you do it, your muscles will be burning. The results are quick--I noticed a distinct improvement in my abs after just a few weeks of doing this tape three times a week. Don't be intimidated by the instructor's flexibility, you can modify the poses to suit your own body. Well worth the money!"
3,Long and Hard,"I love Pilates exercises but have a 10 month old who makes it hard to do a 20 minute work out let alone this 45 minute work out. Frankly I won't be able to do it much. Perhaps Kries is not showing off, but many of these exercises are absolutely impossible for the beginner. Denise Austin may rush the breathing and some of the postures but she's a little more accessible and Denise has two 20 minute workouts you can alternate with on one tape. Jennifer's tape is a good workout but you need an hour without your baby and really strong abdominals to begin with in order to not get discouraged."
3,good tape but not a favourite.,"I've been trying yoga and Pilates to expand my exercise program lately and have viewed several tapes in both areas. This was a good tape but I felt it was a little ""slick"". For some reason I always felt just a bit behind as a beginner. Maybe I'll grow into the tape but it just seemed a bit too oriented toward the ""hip, young, and already flexible"" crowd for a middle aged athletic woman to really appreciate."
2,wouldn't recommend,"Sorry, unless you're really fit, this is not for you. It says it's for all ages and fitness levels, but I disagree, it's extremely difficult. It doesn't have a pretty location, her voice isn't soothing, and worst of all, doesn't end with a good cool down."
2,I like Yoga,I'm not saying this is not a great tape. I think that she has these moves mastered. I'm just saying that Pilates is not for me. I am a vocalist and some of the breathing techniques in Pilates are counter-productive for me. I spoke to an instructor and she seemed to think that they were not but how can you hold your abdomen in and get a good breath going?
1,Too fast,"I read the back of this video and it sounded encouraging with emphasis on the body parts that I wanted to work out. However, halfway through the video, I wanted to quit.I assume the first part of the tape is for beginners. It was okay. After doing the first part, I didn't feel as if I had worked out though.The second part of the tape was too long and she kept doing the moves too fast that I couldn't do it properly. The moves were definitely too hard to perform the first time and I felt as though I knew I was doing something wrong, but didn't know what. Jennifer does an okay job in giving cues, but she doesn't remind people to inhale and exhale everytime. Sometimes, I didn't have time to breath.Even though she reminds people that they won't be able to do the moves as far as she does, I still felt intimidated at how high her legs stretched. I definitely wouldn't recommend this to anyone who hasn't done pilates before."
5,Gain muscle without the bulk,"I love this tape. This tape got me into the Method program. I was tired of doing cheesy aerobic tapes and step routines that were repetitive and only made me bulky. I was already bulky as it was. This tape changed my life. I have fibromyalgia so finding a low impact aerobic and weight lifting routine was hard ( at least one that was interesting). This was perfect. I worked on the first 15 minute introduction and moved on to the 30 minute section. It strengthened my back and whittled away my waist and hips and got rid of the bulky legs. I like the personal effect of this tape, no extras and no music, just you and Jennifer Kries. Man she is excellent and amazing to watch. At first it was kind of intimidating, but after a couple of weeks I could do almost as well as her. My back pain decreased, I looked better, felt great and my posture was excellent. This is an excellent tape that once you have memorized, you can do anywhere whithout the tape."
3,Great video for great abs!,"This video is a good test of what your abs can do! ""Side series"" for thighs & buns are quite mediocre... So if you want to focus on your abs, this video is definitely for you - for other problem body parts try to find something else. In addition, don't forget to turn on your stereo - or you will be working out only with Jennifer's count."
5,I love this work out!!,"This is a great video! I cant say enough good things. I just had a baby and was in a car accident while pregnant resulting in back injuries. I thought Pilates may not be for me because I was so out of shape and injured. Definatly not the case! Another person said there were no modifications to the moves and you had to be fairly fit to even try this work out. Not so!! Several times she says to go only as far as comfortable, you have to follow her directions- then you have a completly tailored work out.True there isnt a whole lot for arms...but I have a baby for that!"
2,Not what I expected,"Great material from an incredible practitioner of the art. That being said, It was presented very cartoony and not at all geared to learn anything useful from. Save your money and look at something different."
3,Interesting But Slightly Outdated,"Getting Lucky, by Ben Johnson, is a compilation of his newspaper columns over the years, answering questions posed by his readers regarding the lottery. The book addresses lotteries in most states, the multi-state lotteries, and the daily pick 3 and pick 4 games.Being a compilation of his columns, some of the questions are redundant, and should have only been included one time, not multiple times. Also, the information is a little dated. For example, the Texas lottery was just starting when some of the questions were posed, and is not addressed at all in other questions and answers.The book is a good ""basic"" guide to the lottery for the beginning lottery player. It is highly entertaining and does shed good information, even though out of date. However, to the more experienced lottery player, there is little to offer.This is not a bad book, just a little dated and includes redundant questions. It is a fast, quick read, being in a question and answer format."
3,Get what you pay for,"Pinnies are pretty tight fitting, wouldn't fit on most adult males. This product consist of one piece of nylon folded over and connected with two white stretch chords. But they will serve their purpose of being all one color and numbered. I returned the product with ease."
3,Good for what you pay,"I would not recommend these for football. Too easy to tear and because the neck opening is ""average"" sized helmets have to be removed every time they are put on or removed (youth football). They would be great for soccer, basketball, etc."
3,Inexpensive option for numbered pinnies,These are fine for the money. They seem durable enough and players are able to move freely. Inexpensive option for numbered pinnies.
4,Good Pinnies for older kids,"I bought these pinnies for my under 9 soccer team. They are definitely too big for them, the kids always complain when they have to wear them. These would probably fit kids 12 years old and older just fine. I don't really care for the plastic feel either. I wish I would have purchased mesh pinnies instead."
3,Cult going in different direction,"This CD is a huge change from their 'Ceremony' CD, this CD is kind of dark, messy, and not the Cult that I love. Still, kudos to them for taking their music down a different path (I'm still here listening) I got a bonus Live CD with this one, so it was a good investment. The song that really saves this CD is 'Be free', (it shows the rock that we love from the Cult whilst incorporating this 'new' sound) 'Universal you' is good also - as it builds up to an explosive chorus. I think the problem with this CD for me is that the songs are kind of slow from what I expect from a Cult record. This is the type of CD where it takes a few good listens to appreciate the music, 'be free' is one of the few songs that grabs you right away."
4,"while not their best,still dam good!","i just got this yesterday,and it's really lets say energetic! i really like this one because it shows you what the cult are capable of,and it's one of the coolest cd's i own,it might take a while to get use to but after listening to it ten time in a row i love it! fav tracks include:1,2*,4*,5*,6*,7,8,9,11*. personal favorite is emperor's new horse!andblack sun."
2,Am I the only Cult fan who didn't like this album?,"First and foremost, I am a great Cult fan, I have all their stuff. For a little perspective I would bring the ""Love"" CD with me if I were going to be marooned on a desert island with a CD player.That being said, I thought they really diverted way out of their league. I seriously had a difficult time determining who was playing their songs. It sounded earily similar to R.E.M.'s CD ""Monster,"" since both came out at the same time.What's the Frequency Kenneth?What's the Deal Ian Astbury?I understand why they sold about 589 albums across the USA when it came out, I actually returned mine for a full refund (I was a starving college kid in '94) so I thin I bought 2 days worth of food for the 13 buck refund.I think its very telling they didn't make another alum for 7 years after this stinker."
2,"""Cult"" is NOT The Cult","nothing but a flat prelude of Cult's dissolution.if you're a CULT first-timer, pick LOVE, ELECTRIC and SONIC TEMPLE... and SKIP this one!"
4,Cult,"Although the best records by The Cult are Electric and Love, this is not a bad CD. You can listen to it with emotion and knowing you have a good group of rock, like Grand Funk, Led Zeppelin or Rolling Stones ..."
5,5 Stars?,"The band that brought the world 'Sweet Soul Sister', 'Fire Woman', 'She Sells Sanctuary', 'Rain' and so on had hit a wall with their previous lp. They came back yet again though. They came back with Bob Rock back on board and created one of their finest albums. This self titled gem is filled to the brim with pure infectious music. From the angst ridden almost grunge like 'Gone' and 'Coming Down (drug tongue)' to the atmospheric sounds of 'Real Grrrl' and 'Joy' this album has it all.For me personally.. it's all about 'Saints are Down'.. the song has crunch.. angst.. melody.. and adrenaline all in one nice lil package. 'Sacred Life' comes in at #2 but the lyrics may seem a bit dated now. It involved those who od'd during that time period.. still a great track though."
2,delete delete delete,"This book was for the most part entertaining and dare I say almost cleverly written. But things just began to unravel as the book continued. For one, the stupidity of the novel's protagonist was just too unbelievable. I too was a huge fan of Stine's Fear Street and Goosebumps series. Sadly, although this one is an adult novel, it just didn't seem like it when everything was said and done. It started out pretty strong but that's about it.Really, the only thing adult about it were the cuss words and sex. The characters were all too juvenile for their ages, Lindy, how blind and niave can you be?And the so-called twist were so silly, not thrilling at all. The ending, completely flaccid."
5,This book was really great.,"I read this book about 3 months ago, and i still remember every detail. I was very suprised on the ending! Read This Book"
5,"Good, but not very scary adult fiction.","This book was good although it lacked scary moments and suddenly got really weird at the end of the book. Plus, you could almost never guesss or predict who it really was. Good if you want to have a ""whodunit"" type of book or suspense, ""keeps you guessing"" book. If you're a big R. L. Stine fan, than this book will be great to you. Goold although not superior scariness writing. Read it if you want a leisurly read or just a good book. The plot idea of the book was very cool too."
2,Not bad,"But not great. Initially, I was thinking this would be a good book because it's sooo hard to find books w/ relateable characters to ourselves. Well, at least that's what I thought based on the back. I open it up to reveal the stupidest, annoyingest dumb blonde ever. She's so busy being sweet, dismissive of other's mistakes, and overly modest that it makes her seem like the ""good girl"" that only thinks she's better than everyone else. You TELL your friends if they have a skeezy guy, and you don't tolerate everything she did. Her stupidity is what got her in trouble in the first place, trying to make herself friendly w/ everyone. I don't remember her being a southern farm girl..."
2,...wow....,"...Yeah, I went into this knowing that it wouldn't be that great, and I wasn't all that disappointed. It was easy to read, and it certainly was a shocker at the end. I read it in maybe... 3 days. so, at least I didn't waste all of my time on this piece of fluff. I suppose I felt as if I were reading a children's book that was a bit more edgy... I don't know. I guess what gave me that feeling was the parts where you get to see into the mind of the killer, or whatever. It was just funny. He freaks out, at one point, and thinks some girl's hair is out to get him. He kind of reminds me of this really old creepy guy who stalks me on the internet.All in all, it wasn't HORRIBLE, but it wasn't good, either. I thought it was cheesy, but at least it was a fast read.So, RL Stine, go back to writing kiddie books."
1,STAY AWAY FROM THIS LOSER,"If I could have given this a negative, I would have said -5. How anyone could say that this is a thriller and that they could not put it down is brain damaged. The writing was absolutely high school, the characters shallow, the plot stupid and the dialogue boring. If anyone wants my copy, send me $2 and I will gladly mail it to you."
5,Beautiful scent,I got this for Christmas last year and LOVED it. It was on my list for this year and I didn't get it so I will have to go purchase it for myself!
5,alsome,Realy great to deal with im in new zealand and took less than two weeks to reach me. Couldnt find a copy of this cd anywhere in n.z shot dude
3,"decent, but not brilliant.","I liked his DJ stuff better. This album is a decent collection of original work. While I really thought the album was going to be great with the first 3 tracks, songs like ""That's How I've Been Dancin'"" made me cover my ears and squint my eyes like the cute asian girl in the insert. This album reminds me of Groove Armada's newest album. Deep and funky with lots of guest vocals. It's a nice album, but nothing brilliant or captivating."
4,Timo keeps getting better every year!,"The first Timo Maas Album I bought was Music For The Maases. I thouroughly enjoyed it. Now I went out on a limb and purchased Loud, and I don't regret buying it one bit! Timo Maas seems to be getting progressively better as the years go on. Timo describes his music as ""wet and hard,"" and it is just that, only this time he mixes more vocals into his tracks. I honestly think of this guy as extremely consistant in making great music, and he's definitely one of the best DJ's in the world today."
1,Very very very disappointed :(,"Timo Maas is a great DJ in person and his previous albums were ok, but this album is horrible. It lulled me to sleep the first time I heard it. I was so disappointed with the repetitious beats that I wish I could have returned it to the store that sold it to me. There is only one track on this album that I like. I suggest you don't waste your money on an album that is obviously lacking in so many ways...no energy, no rhythm, no sense of what the producer was thinking when he produced this utter and pathetic work. Loud: Rated 0."
2,Not a Keeper,"Loved the track with Kelis but I find the rest of this CD unlistenable.Why? Because it isn't that different than alot of the faceless producers putting tracks out on vinyl are doing. That isn't to say the tracks are bad, but I can go down to my local Satellite Record shop and pick up music better than this in the quarter crate any day of the week.Again, I'm not knocking Timo, but I'm upping alot of the people who haven't gotten a break yet. This is definitely an album made by a DJ, versus being an album made by a musician. Almost all the tracks were definitely made to be worked into his sets. Who knows, that might've be his intent but it doesn't resonate with this person. If you want more mediocre music by a DJ who releases full albums, try Oakenfold.Awesome cover though."
2,Ummm...ok.,"Just so I'm not covering ground already mentioned, yes this album ....., but my main disappointment was with the guest appearances of the lyricists (singers, whatever...). Not only are they truly, horribly uninspired on this album, but they really don't move in with the music. I almost felt like I was listening to improvised karaoke lyrics. The music itself is ok, but nothing really new."
4,timo your the man!,"I recently walked into my local record store and heard this cd playing which I thought was amazing.I obviously purchased it and after a few listens wasn't disappointed.I already have ""connected"" but think this is slightly better due the excellent vocal tracks on it.timo goes from strength to stregth and I recommend anyone to purchase this one,you won't be disappointed."
1,You'll Either Love It or Hate It,"This is definitely an album that you'll either love or totally hate. For me, it was the later. I find the never-ending repetitious beats obnoxious and incessantly uncreative. The only thing I found interesting in the least was ""To Get Down"" from which the words ""What Goes Around"" were changed to ""Here Comes the Ram"" for a series of Dodge truck TV commercials. It was interesting for a few seconds. I marvel at how one reviewer of this album remarked, nearly as soon as this album came out, ""You can just see this one being used for various television soundtracks..."" Obviously, he hit it on the money with a commercial at least. Personally, I think the techno riffs are at best decent for a low-budget Sci-Fi flick. There is much better music out there to blow your money on."
4,Good solid utility knife,"It's a good solid utility knife. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because, well... it's a utility knife."
5,Stanley Dynagrip Utility Knife,"I have owned several of these over the years and as far as this type of utility knife is concerned, it's my favorite. The simple rubberized grips make a huge improvement.I'm very happy with it."
2,Rubber handles melted,"I was very surprised that when I opened the box, two of the three rubber inserts had melted and were sticky and messy leaving all sorts of black sticky ooze on my hands that would only come of with paint thinner. Brought it inside to cool off but the rubber remained sticky and came off on the hands and the tool. Very disappointed in it."
3,Software is not great,"My daughter uses this software at pre-school and she enjoyed it, so we bought it for our home computer. Although she thinks it is fun, I really do not see that she is learning much Spanish from it (for that, try DORA) She enjoys the games more than the learning aspect of it. My problem with the software is that it always seems to malfunction. It ""sticks"" and every now & then the sound just does not work. My daughters teacher said they have the same problems with the software they use in her school. Based on that, I would only give this an average rating."
2,Disappointed with pronunciation,I was disappointed with the American accent of the characters' voices - they should have used native speakers. I am a native speaker of Latin American Spanish and prefer Kidspeak software - even though it teaches the European Spanish pronuciation.
2,Software has problems with audio,"This looks like it could be a very beneficial product. It installed easily on Windows 2000 and some audio works- there is music playing and a rabbit that speaks, but when pointing or clicking on items in a room, the text pops up in spanish but there is no audio to pronounce the word. This is a problem unless the parent speaks spanish and intends to sit at the computer the entire time and pronounce the words for them. Tech support was prompt but not helpful. Product info doesn't list Windows 2000 as an operating system for this product, but it is listed on the cd itself."
3,"Easy to memorize the game, but...","My 3 year old daughter likes this program. She has learned all the Spanish words and phrases and can use her knowledge as long as she's playing the game, but when I ask her a Spanish word outside the context of the game, she's not good at applying what she's learned to real life.I am having better luck teaching her Spanish by learning more Spanish myself and then when a situation arises in which I can use it, I teach her the word or phrase. She also remembers songs in Spanish and is able to sing them back herself when I sing them to her, but she wasn't able to do that very well after hearing them on the computer. When I don't know a Spanish word, we look at the dictionary together, and then she remembers the word better than I do and can use it.Some software teaches my daughter as well or better than I can, but in the case of learning a language, I recommend software for the parent, not the child."
2,"8 ok to good songs, sound quality for remaster VERY poor.","I was a teenager and was lulled into thinking REO was great by MTV and radio. some expected radio friendly songs on this Hits collection, but I don't know where the remastering went wrong. sound is thin, alot of highs and mids, alot of EQ on certain frequencies makes it hard to listen to. I've owned CDs were the remaster was not noticeably better, but I suspect that the original hits cd might sound as bad or better???? somebody else might know. I'll keep it around if I want to hear an old favorite, but I CANNOT recommend the reissue due to poor sound quality. I gave it 2 stars because I do remember and kinda like more than half the songs."
4,good cd,"i've been wanting this CD for quite a while, and finally got around to buying it... love this music"
3,Not the best compilation,"Given that the Essential compilation is 2 CDs and about 150 minutes of material (remastered), it's a better bet than this one (at under an hour). If you can get a copy of this, make sure it's remastered and dirt cheap. Otherwise, look for the Essential comp, it's commonly on Amazon for less than $13."
5,A fine introduction to the Reo Speedwagon radio experience.,"The Hits is exactly what it says it is, a collection of Reo Speedwagon's biggest radio hits and two I Don't Want to Lose You and Here with Me making their first appearance on an Reo album. The songs like Roll with the Changes, Time for Me to Fly, Take it on the Run, Keep on loving You, Can't fight this feeling, Ridin the storm out cover most of Reo's best known songs, as well as concert favorites like Keep Pushin' and Back on the Road Again, the only big hit out at the time that's missing is Keep the Fire Burnin. The Hits does an excellent job of capturing the spirit of the Reo Speedwagon radio experince and is all most casual fans will need."
4,REO Speedwagon - Guilty Pleasure,"I can't say I know every song on this playlist. I never owned a record, or tape, or CD of the band, for that matter. Nevertheless I fondly remember a number of these hits, and a few of them speak to me and evoke times in my life. For genuine sappiness, try a little ""Roll With the Changes"" or ""Keep on Loving You."" You won't find any better. :-)It's not for everyone, but I think my generation who grew up in the 70's and 80's will enjoy this."
1,YUCK!,"REO Speedwagon represents the absolute worse in faceless, corporate rock that the late 1970's and 1980's had to offer. Along with tripe like Journey (whose lead singer rivaled REO's lead vocalist in most nails on a chalkboard sound-a-like voice) and others they manufactured generic stadium junk that is best forgotten. Avoid."
1,Forget,"If there are two bands on earth I can't stand it is Marylin Manson and REO Speedwagon.True, they represent two different ends of the spectrum, but both are no good hacks who can't sing their way out of a wet paper bag and who success has been pure luck and marketing rather than talent of which neither has."
1,One of the many worst of the 80s,This cd is a miserable trip back in time...these and the horrid songs of the 80's.
1,Horrific,"Some of the absolute worst in faceless, corporate rock is to be found here. With the nails on a chalkboard vocals of Kevin Cronan, you'll be hard pressed to find ""music"" more unlistenable than this.Still, let us hope that this CD will always be in print. Future musicologists will trace punk back to here. This is something to rebel against!"
1,NOT PLEASED,RECENTLY PURCHASED CD FOR MY DAUGHTER WHO LOVES THE MUSIC. IT CAME WITH A BROKEN CASE AND SOME TRACKS NOT PLAYABLE. NO RESPONSE FROM SELLER AFTER REGISTERING A COMPLAINT WITH AMAZON. SO MUCH FOR SATISFACTION.
1,Just not a good band.,The singer's voice is nasal and whiny. And how can you see the full moon if there's a storm in the Rocky Mountains? This is the kind of 80's rock that shifted my tastes from AOR to new wave/laternative.
4,Classics forever,Will always be a fan of this genre! I have not embraced modern Rock and am satisfied with listening to the classics.
5,Great,This was to replace a CD that was stolen and my hubby missed it so I decided to replace it for him.
3,REO Speedwagon,"Maybe I was a bit fuzzy through the 70's and 80's, but I don't remember too many of these 'greatest hits'. Was really waiting for 'Riding the Storm Out', but got some lame 'live' version that didn't do the original version justice. My suggestion is passing this one by and finding another 'greatest hits' version."
2,"""MISSING HITS"" is more like it!",Get a load of the HITS this cd doesn't have:IN YOUR LETTERKEEP THE FIRE BURNIN'I DO'WANNA KNOWLIVE EVERY MOMENTWhy weren't these songs inlcuded when the disc was remastered? There's certainly enough space. Save your money until they release a nice 2-disc anthology or 4-cd box set with all the hits.
4,O REO.,"As has happened many times, I got this collection and remembered how many hits they really had, and how much I liked them back when. Being a child of the 80's they were kind of hard to avoid. Sure we all know ""Can't Fight This Feeling"" and ""Keep On Loving You"" by heart, but I also really enjoy ""Take It On The Run"" and ""Time For Me To Fly"". And I think my favorites are ""In My Dreams"" and ""One Lonely Night"", both are easy to like. Overall a great REO classic rock/80's collection for the casual fan. If you need even more, check out the recent 2-disc ""Essential"" collection."
4,All the classics I grew up with are here,Because I am an eighties girl and Reo was my favorite band growing up. This is one of those albums I play to reminisce about the good ol' days. Great music!
4,"The Lyrics May Change, But The Song Remains The Same","OK, I know, I know, REO is not the most inventive band from the 80's. Many of their songs sound the same, but, hey! They do have the ability to deliver a decent ballad. Their songs are imprinted on my psyche from nearly every high school party I went to (and the airplay, oh my gosh, the airplay).This is a great compilation for THIS band. It has all of their good stuff and even a couple of OK tunes (This Ain't Love and Keep Pushin'). I particularly like In My Dreams, Here With Me, Roll With The Changes (Their Best), Time For Me To Fly and Back On The Road Again. It's a good addition to a respectable 80's pop/rock collection. Give it a try."
5,You can't really lose with this one...,"Wow. Many people might not remember what great balladeers REO Speedwagon were in the 70's and 80's - but this seems to me to be a 'cant lose' example. Cronin's voice is definately unique, and powerful and the lyrics to most of these songs, while a bit sappy to some - are truly one of a kind, and totally REO.After a long time, I recently slid this CD into my player while on a long trip, and suddenly found myself reliving my life in the 80's through songs I'd long forgotten about. When It got to ""Only In My Dreams"" I suddenly recalled a lost love, and a time in my life when everything was good and wonderful... I got so emotional I had to pull onto the side of the road, and burst into tears.Not many bands can make you do that. These guys are truly legendary. If you want a good taste of classic 70s/80s soft rock - this is it."
4,EXACTLY like my time in 1988 TOKYO too,"I lived in TOKYO in 1988-1989.So many of the things that this girl in the movie does was EXACTLY what happened to me when I lived there.I even had the short short hair ( but red ) and I would wear the biker jacket with the mini dresses.How she got there and her adventures are so much the same as I did too.I enjoyed this movie . It is not a great movie , but it is fun & it brings back the memories.It is VERY real to what TOKYO was in 1988 for an american girl like her ( and me ) ."
2,Most disappointing,"I've been using Princeton's prep book for my AP European History, Calculus, Microeconomics, Macroeconomics; SAT and ACT. Because I trusted Princeton Review, I immediately chose this book as a preparation for my AP Statistics Test(which will be tomorrow.. gosh. I should be studying right now, not writing a review.) Sample Free Response Questions are just awful. Moreover, answers are awful too. Sample FR questions show almost no relevent to the test and the answer explanations are way too confusing that I don't even know what they are talking about.I trusted them, and I will. But I am disapppointed on this one. I would prefer my text over this one (which was opposite for other subjects)"
3,Medium Priced CD,"This mid priced CD player lacks the sound of players in the upper range. The first thing I had to do was replace the headphones as the ones provided did not have decent clarity and gave a distorted sound. However, once that was done the sound fell into the medium-good (and passing) quality.The player stalls and skips when hitting bumps, and when being touched at the top of the cover while playing.However, the tracking is overall pretty good, the features work, and as long as you dont use this heavily and for things such as running or jogging, it is a passable player."
5,Excellent Buy!,"I've been shooting underwater photos for 10 years and never have I read a book that so throughly explains the technology of cameras, and relates it so well to the underwater realm. The crew of the Turks and Caicos Aggressor liked it so much I gave Captain Piers a copy and have come back to Amazon.com for another for myself."
2,For the most serious completist,"There's alot of great music on Little Richard's third Reprise album - too bad he's not very involved with it - only 5 *singing* cuts - others are instrumentals or monologues.If you love to hear Richard really open up his voice box to show off his olympian octave leaps and powerful vibrato, this is the last Richard CD you need.Best track, a sensational 10 minute instrumental where the '50s meets the '70s, in the best tradition.(Excellent liner notes; improved sound)."
3,two shakers each with an S on top.,I like the color and size but both have an S on top. Also the photo when zoomed in shows two different tops. I hate the hassel of having to return. I would however think that a partial refund/compensation should be considered. A sticker on the package said last set. Please respond and advise.
2,Scarlet is a BIG disappointment!,"If you love the scarlet Fiesta, don't think you're going to get that same bright pop of red in these salt and pepper shakers! They don't even come close to the red of my other scarlet Fiesta pieces. More of a faded, dull red. Nothing at all like the photo. Huge disappointment! :("
1,Seconds,I was very disappointed in the quality of the fiesta ware. It was seconds probably from an outlet. The first set I ordered was cracked so I sent it back for a replacement. The second set I received was a little better but still had flaws.I would not recommend purchasing this salt and pepper set.
3,Not quite the quality I expected.,The quality of the salt and pepper shakers was not what I had seen with previously purchased Fiesta items. One of the shakers was much darker than the other and the glazing on one seemed much thicker than the glazing on the other leaving the shapes quite different as well.
3,Dirty,"I just opened the Amazon box with my Fiesta Ware salt and pepper shakers. They were red like I ordered and they were for the range top, but they were dirty and the rubber gasket on the bottom of the salt shaker had cobwebs all over it. They can be washed of course and there were no dead bugs in them or anything but I thought they would have come in a Fiestaware box, not just wrapped in bubble wrap in an Amazon box and at least with the dust wiped off of them."
3,Fiesta Rangeto[ Salt and Pepper set,I like the looks of it but it is too heavy . It is too heavy to shake .I would not purchase this again
3,Collectable,"Not practical book to carry and to read it while outside, but it is just the way how ALL-IN-ONE book is...However, good to have all his works together..."
5,Great book for killer price,"When I first saw this book I went straight to the reviews. There were many good and some bad. I ended up buying the book, and let me tell you, this was a good buy. I have no idea if this book contains all of his work, but it's most if not all. With this book you get stories, plays, poems (huge collection), poems in prose, essays and letters. All of wich are titled.As for those that do not like this book, maybe you are mistaken.Shipping was very fast, book was in exact condition as stated."
5,A True Collection,"This compilation of Wilde's works are perfect for any Wilde fan. Though the size is occasionally an obstacle, the actual content is not. The works are catagorized thoughtfully and portrayed beautifully."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK,"This book is a sham. It is not the complete works of Oscar Wilde but, instead, a collection of sections."
1,random & time wasting,"This is not a sensible product. It is a mess of randomly scanned sections with no titles or headings. Do not waste your time with this book, I'm sure there has to be a more organized collection of Oscar Wilde. General Books should be ashamed of their unmatchable laziness."
1,Not a winner at all. The least of all the Adagio series.,"Puts you to sleep, I don't mean relaxation, but sleep."
1,Not a winner at all. The least of all the Adagio series.,"Puts you to sleep, I don't mean relaxation, but sleep"
3,"does not measure up to the Arkady Renko series, but it's fun","Without a doubt, the worst movie I ever had the displeasure of paying to see, Nightwing turns out to be a fine thriller. It's Stephen King by way of Tony Hillerman as plague ridden vampire bats descend on a Hopi reservation.Replete with a lone hero tribal policeman, corrupt Indian politicians, a mad scientist, bigoted evangelists & a vengeful shaman, this early effort from Martin Cruz Smith does not measure up to the Arkady Renko series, but it's fun.GRADE: C+"
3,Gloriously okay,"In this book, a plaque of vampire bats rises up out of a cave in the New Mexico desert.Yeah, that's pretty much the story.I mean, sure they bite people, and people die, and there are some reasons why the bats are there, and the New Mexico desert and the reservation are used as very spooky settings, but ""Nightwing"" never really moves above being anything more than a typically page-turning modern pulp.The ending's a bit disappointing, too, but overall the book was enjoyable, good enough that after I finished it, I decided to hold onto it for a possible rereading some years down the road.There's also a 1979 movie based on this, filmed on location, and I hear it's fairly all right."
3,Slow,"I have actually seen the film of this movie when I was a kid, and I thought it was really scary and interesting. The book is similar tot he movie almost to the letter. The only problem is the book just seemed so hard to get through. For a 218 page book it felt like it dragged, and as I think about it I can't answer why. The book basically details a Witch doctor, who is against the expansion of western Ideals into his reservation. He then, unleashes a curse that deals with plague carried by Vampire Bats. I know the premis sound very good, but execution didn't do it for me."
2,"Don't waste time, move to Renko","Written 25 years ago, Nightwing has only one of the talents we have come to admire in Martin Cruz Smith. Great research. Apart from that, the hero is not Renko and the story is basically a big yawn. Unless you 're really into that indian thing, move ahead to Gorky Park."
1,"States the obvious, little behind the scenes information.","This book can be skimmed. If a chapter is five pages long, 4 1/2 pages are spent explaining who a player is (which hockey fans already know) and 1/2 page is spent on the penalty box incident. This was a very disappointing read for any serious hockey fan."
2,Into My Garbage Bin,"As a recreational hockey player and avid hockey fan by night and publications editor by day, I found this book to be boring and over the top. His anecdotes about NHL enforcers are sanitized to a ""Family Channel""- level style of writing, about as pointless and meaningless as an Eminem CD edited for Christian radio stations. In keeping with the Mighty Ducks/Disney/Mickey Mouse squeaky-clean environment he works in, his words, even his direct quotes, are cleansed, leaving only adjectives along the lines of ""making comments about my ancestors"" as a euphemism for swearing, a phrase only my own ancestors used. If you can't talk the talk, Lloyd, then write the scripts for the MVP sequels.Readers, buy the book ""Goon"" instead for real-life hockey experiences told as they happenend - blood, guts, and all."
3,Kids will enjoy the book.,"I think kids will enjoy this book. I found it said the same things over and over (basically, the hockey player is going to mess up my face in the penalty box) and it got tiring quickly. For true tidbits of inside information, you're going to have to look somewhere else. You can skim the good parts in about 15 minutes. We know why Lloyd was an off-ice official and not an author."
2,Should have been ghostwritten.,"Some of the stories could have been really entertaining, but Mr. Freeburg, as nice as he seems, doesn't really know what a punchline is. He spends pages and pages building up to a great climax but forgets to actually tell you what that climax is. Most of the stories seem to be had-to-be-there types; not so good to fill a book."
3,Great Subject... something most hockey fans wonder about`,I thought the book was pretty good. The story about Probie and the pucks is worth the price of admission....
2,a great book for a non serious hockey fan,"I had high expectations of this book, and was disappointed. The few actual stories that the book detailed were entertaining, but it was obvious to me that many of the stories were grossly exaggerated (do you really think that Lloyd was seriously intimidated by Kris Draper?) I was expecting to read about the ""inside scoop"" but I felt that the true stories were manipulated to make each seem more entertaining. Like I said, someone who doesn't know a whole lot about hockey would get a real kick out of it, I myself was only mildly entertained, and oftentimes skimmed through all of the background info on each player and just read the account of the event in each chapter."
5,"Hilarious, made me a fan of professional hockey !","After reading Freeberg's book I have a whole new perspective on professional hockey. His mastery of understatement and irony kept me smiling and laughing from cover to cover. Each time I started to put the book down I found myself picking it up again thinking ""what's next""? Not only is it throughly enjoyable but I learned quite a lot about the players and the operation of the NHL. Before I read the book I wasn't a follower of the NHL, now I am!"
1,Don't bother.,"The author seems like a nice enough guy, but there certainly aren't enough good stories here to fill a worthwhile book."
4,Last disc of the box set,"The final release in Beggars Banquet's 10 CD collector's edition ""Singles Collection: 1984-1990"".Track listing:1) Sweet Soul Sister (Single Version) 3:322) The River 6:533) Love Removal Machine (Live) 4:434) Lil' Devil (Live) 2:485) Revolution (Live) 5:386) Sweet Soul Sister (Live) 5:327) American Horse (Live) 7:158) Soul Asylum (Live) 7:329) Sweet Soul Sister (Rock's Mix) 6:56Tracks 3-5 were recorded at Hammersmith Odeon, London 16 March, 1987Tracks 6-8 were recorded at Wembley Arena, 24 November, 1989"
2,"Read the ""Tightwad Gazette"" books instead.","While this book is acceptable, like other reviewers I found it a bit over-emotional and feel Amy Dacyzycn's tightwad books are MUCH better. This reads a bit like a Heloise book, lots of scattered tips, some are good, some are obvious. Half the book is spent talking about credit cards. Yes, credit cards can be evil, but it all depends on the person using them. Overall, I was not very impressed with this book, and I'm glad I got it out of the library."
2,good for beginners,"Mary Hunt's books are good for the beginner. This is a rehash of her other book as the last person wrote, so only purchase one. If you want every possible option there is to save money, read the Tightwad Gazette 1-3."
3,Miserly Moms is Heaps Better!,"I read this book and like the other people who made reviews, I found that too many chapters were taken up with credit card advice. I also didn't particularly like the format of the book. You had to read chapters upon chapters to find any useful information rather than in point format. Some of the information was useful, but I think Miserly Moms and The Tightwad Gazette's are much better."
4,Lots of Really Good Tips,"This book includes a lot of tips for managing your finances. I especially liked the way she handles the ""allowance"" issue with her kids. The book reminds us that materialism doesn't provide joy, and may eventually give us lots of grief! The book also has a lot of humor in it, too, so you don't feel so totally depressed when you look at your own financial situation."
3,"I like the book, but it could have been better.","This is probably the best book of its kind, but it has some deficiencies over the first edition. I couldn't find the entry for the Interstate Commerce Commission (which article is mentioned in the introduction). I also disliked relegation of the railroader biographies to a section in the back, without the photographs (instead of as sidebars near the entry for the railroad whose history they effected). However the inclusion of the Union Pacific, which is still extant, was a good idea. I still like the book, but it could have been better."
5,great,They are very comfortable to wear and easy to go with different outfits. Great for walking. I will absolutely buy those again if needed!
2,HAPPY FEET,"THIS SHOES ARE AWESOME IM HAPPY AND CONTENT WITH THEM IVE PICKED UP WALKING LATELY AND THESE ARE GREAT MY FEET DONT HURT,I DONT GET BLISTERSI AM SO HAPPY WITH AMAZON. COM AND ALL THE THINGS I HAVE PURCHASED FROM THEM FOR NOT SEEING IN PERSON FIRST."
3,Complete Track List,"1 Move Away 4:192 I Pray 3:593 Work On Me Baby 4:254 Gusto Blusto 4:405 Heaven's Children 4:436 God Thank You Woman 4:137 Reasons 4:358 Too Bad 4:349 Come Clean 3:1810 Sexuality 5:2711 Move Away (Extended) 7:2512 God Thank You Woman (Extended) 7:0313 Sexuality (Extended) 10:343 Stars since this album is not as good as others they have released,in my own opinion. Darned hard to get for a reasonable price here inthe good ol' USA. I paid $12.09 to my door..."
2,A sad album ... not representative of Culture Club at all.,"This is the sound of musical (and commecial?) desperation. The warmth and melody that brought Culture Club to life in the early 80's is missing. There are some catchy moments, but many of the feeble attempts at slick techno-pop are embarrassing. Also, the lyrical self-censorship (Boy George singing love songs to WOMEN? Come on!) is downright frustrating. Hopefully, the new VH1 reunion will restore the band to greatness."
5,It has been a work horse.,"I have had this computer for almost 7 years and I am still waiting for it to go bad. So far I've got more RAM memory and a bigger hard drive. Other than that this computer has been a work horse for me. I also use an external PC wireless card, I have traveled with it multiple times and nothing has gone bad with it.Sony scored big time with the components on this laptop, I use it at least 4 hrs. a day every day. With all the windows XP Service packs and newer software this computer is pretty slow but I can still run Photoshop and listen to music at the same time.Congratulations Sony for creating this high quality, long lasting computer."
1,This is a small information giving website,I did not like that they did not give a price for the Sony Vaio PCG-FR130. That is to bad for them because i was interested in buying that modle but i guess i will go to another competetor.
3,Light use only,"Should work for light duty. My old Stanley Contractor Grade 100FT tape (model 34-252) tape broke so I purchased this 100FT tape, removed the tape inside, put it in my old Contractor Grade tape, and threw this case away. The old Contractor Grade case is tougher with steel rollers at mouth. Oh, how I wish I could purchase a 100FT tape like the old round tape that my father has; it was built to last."
1,Arrived with faulty winding mechanism,I never had a chance to try the tape. Upon receiving the tape I pulled out a few feet to check the markings. I went to wind it back up and the winder fails to recall the tape. I'm able to extend the tape but not wind it back up. I had to return this tape for a refund.Very poor quality control when the mechanism does not work right out of the box. Another piece of junk made in China.I've come to accept that Stanley no longer makes tapes that last the test of time. I typically replace my tapes every couple of years when the winder invariably fails to unwind or wind. In contrast my fathers Stanley tape measure has been working great for over 30 years! If anyone can recommend a tape measure they still make with the pride they made in my fathers day then please post a comment.
1,Hallmark Card Studio 2004,"My recent experience with Hallmark Card Studio 2004 software, a Sierra Home product, turned out to be a disaster. They have lost their touch trying to make a reliable product better. The time and effort wasted trying to print from the Greeting Card Program is unacceptable. Printing is slow and tedious. As a long time customer, I am very disappointed and discouraged. Where is the quality that we expect from a good, long standing company bearing the name of HALLMARK?"
1,Could be much better,"This product is ok in that it saves you money on buying cards, but I have NEVER been able to make a calendar. Every time I try to go to March, it locks up and shuts down. I was really looking forward to making calendars with pictures of my kids, but no luck. I have written numerous emails to Sierra for help and they only responded to the first email in which they instructed me to uninstall/reinstall which I have done numerous times to no avail. I am very disappointed with Sierra's customer service. I also can't believe I am the only one having this error when trying to go into March to create a calendar or even just looking at March in the Event Planner. Hopefully I will find someone else who knows what to do."
1,it's terrible,"I'm really dissappointed with this product. Unlike other Hallmark programs, it does not have all it says on the program and it locks up my system, (which is a brandnew p4) When I can get it to work it only prints part of the card and does not center it correctly so the finished product looks terrible.I think Hallmark needs to fix the problems and offer a working upgrade."
1,Junk Software,I could not get the software to open. Called Sierra tech support & they had me try 7-10 other options to change in my computer settings. I finally went to Sierra web site and found out this was a defective issue. Go to the web site BEFORE you purchase any of their products and visit downloads forum to see all the issues. They do not disclose gliches over the phone they want you to think it is a unique problem! 7 hours later....
5,Getting started,"This is the second Ryrie Study Bible, it was my first study Bible and so I bought for a new Christian who want to learn more and so I bought it for her. It is very detailed and full of useful information, it's a great investment for anyone wanting to know more about God..."
3,Excellent Study Bible,"Before I go any further, this edition of the Ryrie Study Bible, NAS, is NOT genuine leather. The genuine leather edition sells retail for $99, and is bound by the bindery to the Sultan of Brunei, and is an excellent, well-made and beautiful, Bible. This edition is bonded leather, is glue-bound, and is junk, plain and simple. I don't know where Moody has these bonded leather Bibles bound, but they need to find another bindery who can do some quality work. I just recently dug up a letter from 1992, where Moody Press readily admitted that these bonded leathers are basically sub-quality as compared with previous editions.Otherwise, the Ryrie Bible is great: the font is large and dark, the helps are excellent, with in-text maps and charts, doctrinal references in the back, and great maps. I prefer it to the Scofield. But, if you have the bucks and can afford it, get the genuine leather edition instead of this."
3,Not genuine leather,"The ads do not tell you that this is a bonded leather Bible. However, it is indeed bonded and not genuine. I bought two of these thinking I was buying genuine leather as gifts, only to find that I had purchased bonded leather Bibles, which do not hold up half as well as genuine leather. Heavy users should always purchase genuine leather, as bonded leather soon begins to tear at the corners."
3,not too happy,"I did receive the Bible I requested and it was ""like new"", except for one thing - it had a large ""permanent marker"" mark (the whole side of the gold gilted pages.)It was like it was marked ""as a second"" - I tried everything to get the ""mark"" off,ended up taking some of the gold off, (never did get the the permanent marker off), then I noticed that the red lettering on some of the pages were ""off line"" - anyhow, this particular book is ""out of print"" so decided to keep it. I paid top dollar for this item. Will not do work with this particular vendor again."
5,Great Knives,"These knives are great, I used to be a chef and used the original Four Star knives everyday for many years. I bought a set of these a couple years ago and love them, we just bought another set for a friend's wedding gift. I do recommend getting the 7,9, or 11 piece set and purchase the steak knives separately, as the full set comes with steak knives that don't have the matching handles."
5,great!,These knives are really wonderful. Everything is useful and easy to use. I love them all. But you have to be careful not to cut your fingers.
4,Just because of the knives....,"Dear Henckles,I HATE knife racks/holder blocks!(Not just you, all the others we have). Could you make that an option, please? I and my husband will never buy another type of knife, yours are THE best, but the blocks.....? Again, we completely understand that people use that. It's just that we have so many in our pantry.... Maybe it could be and option you that buyers could opt out of? Thank you for taking a look at my opinion. Well......did you?"
3,Mixed feelings,"I have had mixed feelings about the Norton Utilities for years. On one hand it gives you some improved tools, over those provided with windows (disk defragmentation, scan disk, registry editor, etc.). On the other hand, my experience has been that the utilities are sometimes the source of the problem rather than the fix and there is deffinitely some damage done from ""overengineering"" your PC with the tools. I wouldn't recommend them for inexperienced users - Norton has made them really easy to use but they can really do some damage if you click the wrong button. More experienced users usually use a single utility out of the package anyway (I only use it for the registry editor)."
2,Why????,"Why Symantec include less utilities in this version of norton? if you see the Norton Y2K you see a great pruduct with a lot of utilities very complete with a great performance and a lot of scan's well i change all my system and buy some software, starting use WinXP and the things going great and i buy Norton Y2K+2 and i see this all the features incluiding are great but definitly are less, the Norton Y2K+2 don't have a lot of utilities and funtions and scan's including in the Norton Y2K, well if you can run a older version thing very well if you want tu buy the Norton Y2K+2"
1,Don't Download this Item!!,I donloaded Norton Utilities 2002 a week ago. The product I received was Norton AntiVirus 2002. As of today I still haven't got anywhere getting this corrected by Amazon!! Don't waste your money on this download!!Buyer Beware!!
2,NOT designed for XP,"I bought this program, assuming from the ""Designed for XP"" sticker on the box that it was, in fact, compatible with XP. However, the disk scanner cannot access the NTFS filesystem, which allows full use of XP disk features, while XP is running - and the bootable disks don't support NTFS as well. So, you will spend good money for this utility, only to have it run the Windows scanner instead. Plus, the rescue disks are still written in DOS and don't work well with a non-DOS-based system like XP, and a number of the features only run on 98 or ME systems! This is not designed for XP - it is a program designed for Win98 and problematic with XP that someone happened to slap a sticker of approval on. It gets 2 stars because some of the other tools could be useful."
2,Earlier Versions Definitely Better,"While this is still a decent product, they have removed a number of the utilities that were offered in earlier versions. When I asked Norton about this, their response was ""You can uninstall the new version and reinstall the old one,"" which is like saying, ""Oh, well, guess you wasted your money when you upgraded!"" Norton claims to have taken away some utilities because they weren't being used. Hey, I used them, and I bet a lot of others did, too. All in all, I was very disappointed in the ""upgrade"" I bought."
4,"A good, simple to use program to help solve some bugs","I run Windows NT on a laptop that I use regularly, and it was running slow at times and I kept getting some strange error messages. I bought Norton Utilities 2002 to fix this up and it did just that. I've found, though, that if you keep the Norton Disk Doctor open and running to continuously monitor your system, it does slow things down a bit. However, if you just keep it closed, and run the utilities like Speed Disk and WinDoctor every now and then, it should keep everything on your system running smoothly. Also, note that the first time you run Speed Disk (essentially a disk defragmenter) it may take a while (it took me about an hour and half with with a Pentium III 466), but it doesn't take half as long after that first time. I think it was worth the money."
2,aftershave overprced,"Quick service but other vendors offer the ""tester"" with more volume and a lower price per Oz."
2,"Happy Halloween, Biscuit!","This was a bad impulse purchase. I scanned it to make sure the pictures weren't scary, but I didn't read it from cover to cover. As endearing as some may find these characters to be, this story annoys me. Reading all the, ""Woof's"" gets old after the first sitting, and the story is just too sappy for me.In addition, I don't like Halloween books that show children trick-or-treating alone. I know this is nitpicking, but I don't want my child getting the idea that wandering the streets alone at night is a safe thing to do. On the plus side, this is a lift-the-flap book, and little ones enjoy the hide-and-seek qualities these kinds of books offer.There are so many wonderful Halloween books today, this isn't one of them."
3,"Fire Woman, best track after Love","If LOVE is a 10 out of 10, Dreamtime 8 out of 10, Fire Woman is the best thing they did after 1985. It tries to get a bit psychedelic, but still leans to the rockier side of things. It lacks originality compared to LOVE and Dreamtime, but proves the band still had it. 6.5 for this one, mostly for Fire Woman. Nice to see remixes on CD, vinyl being a little hard to come by these days! Check my other reviews for LOVE + Dreamtime. And by some CULT, you'll love 'em!"
4,Killer TV for the price,Bought a new one that had box damage. I have had it for a month no problems to speak of. Also it takes HD it is only 480i but for 99.99 I couldn't go wrong.
5,Ab Blast Does That and More,"Ab Blast has everything I want in a workout with the convenience of a DVD. The exercises are simple but still challenging and enjoyable. After exercising with Bernadette both live and on this DVD I have found these simple movements to trim several inches off of my entire body while building strength and agility. Rather than just working one isolated body part these exercises engage the whole body and mind while trimming those abs. Bernadette sets the pace that allows me to concentrate on the form of each movement to get the most benefit. Just when I start lapsing in form she is there reminding me to ""relax my shoulders"", ""engage my abs"", ""breathe"". The soft lighting, background scenery and small class size on this DVD make me feel as though I'm in a semi-private class. I highly recommend this DVD if you like to feel relaxed yet invigorated and ready to move through the day with grace and strength."
4,,"This album is evil as hell and that's no joke. Very few bands manage to play death metal and sound malevolent. For Drawn and Quartered, it appears to be in their nature to be just that. The music hits you with sheer intensity. Turn it up even louder and you'll feel like you're being beaten unconsciously. From pure bursts of adrenaline-filled drum blast/rolls combination to interesting bass lines, and a few exceptional guitar soloing thrown in for good measure, Hail Infernal Darkness is a tumultuous experience."
4,A fine recording,"I prefer this interpretation to that on the Arte Nova issue, recorded in Munich. It is more relaxed and more idiomatic, not surprising as the artistes come from Romania, where Enescu's music is known and played more often than elsewhere. The music is beautiful and the first sonata is easily accessible. I found the second sonata needed aeveral hearings, as usual with Enescu's later works, but also very rewarding.The sound balance between the two instruments is good, as is the atudio acoustic and technical quality."
4,Lovely romantic cello sounds,"The first sonata is a very early work in a typical central-european romantic style; the second sonata is in Enescu's mature idiom, folk-inflected but highly original and rhapsodic. The performers play with great feeling and the sound is better than usual from this source."
5,I've been absolutely positively captured by David LaRochelle,"I sat in a writing session with David at a Young Authors Conference in the Spring of 2007. I was so impressed with his ablility to communicate effective ways of using humor to convey important ideas to youth, that I immediately purchased his book Absolutely Positively Not. I read it in one sitting, being absolutely positively captured by his graceful and naturally funny treatment of a certain young man's coming of age story. As an educator, I highly recommend this book to both youth and adults alike. David's perspective is priceless."
3,uhhh,"its okay. not that good and not that badd..i know its not funny, just wery twisted...dont recommend"
3,NOT the Iowa Greg Brown,"Note to prospective purchasers: although co-marketed with other GB albums, this is NOT the Iowa folk singer."
1,BUYER BEWARE!,"This is NOT by the Greg Brown of Red House Records fame - wish I had realized that before I ordered it for my wife as a Christmas present as she is a BIG Greg Brown fan! I thought I had found an album she didn't already have... My mistake!We gave it a try, though, with my wife trying to be an optimistic good sport about the whole thing - a few of the cuts aren't bad but over all it vaguely reminded me of a poorly produced version of some old Yes songs - the guitar is drowned out by an assortment of orchestral pieces - perhaps the listening was doomed from the beginning, but I still found the album to be a write-off."
2,Broke,After only 2 weeks on my rifle the front sight broke. That is the second one to do that. It is not very durable.
4,not bad,"These sights do exactly what they say they do. They take some definate getting used to, and they dont fit very well. But at least theres too much material on them rather than not enough. Its nothing a couple of passes with a file didnt fix, and they work very well once installed"
2,TruGlo: False Impression,"This is the second time I purchased a set of TruGlo sights and have been disappointed.They advertize them as being CNC machine; giving the impression they are steel.They may be CNC machined, but they are almost entirely plastic.I won't make that mistake again..."
1,Did not fit.,"The end sight did not fit the notch on the nozzle. I am going to have to file it and sand it to get it to fit. I even took it to a gun store and they told me it just does not fit right.I recomend buying anything for a Ruger from Ruger, or its just wrong. Don't buy this unless you want a problem.Neil"
2,Truglu rifle set for 10/22,"Probably would be great if it fit my 10/22!Photo shows dovetail but that's not what you get. The fine print says ""carbine"", which is what I have but I have a see through picatinny rail and was hoping to replace my old dovetail.Now I'm stuck with a 30 something sight I can't use:)Live and learn"
4,lovely,very pretty cross. a little smaller then i had thought but very nice.i purchaced another one in lavender.
5,Classic Bonkers Attempt,"Crazy Tufts professor (and grandson of Woodrow Wilson) and his pals attempt a stealth climb of Everest. For food they pack only meat cubes and bags of sugar. They bivouac in the open well above 20,000 feet and are lucky to have a still, warm night. They fall into crevasses and yet live. A very funny book and well worth finding a copy."
3,disappointing,"I bought this book in preparation for an airplane trip with my family, including a 5 year old autistic daughter. As I am familiar with Kranowitz's book The Out of Sync Child, regarding sensory integration, I was disappointed that there was not more in the book that I could use with my daughter. Also, the ideas that could be used away from home are somewhat limited.I have found some fun activities in this book to do with my children at home, so it is not a worthless book. However, it didn't really fill the need I was looking for."
4,Good ideas but kind of dated,"We have done some of the activities in this book. such as the water dog and the shaving cream paint. I was looking for things to do on a plane...Not so good. but gets your mind moving on other things and modifying activities to make them more ""on the go""..."
1,If it only worked...,I received this as a gift from my younger sister last week. I didn't have the heart to tell her it didn't work on my new Windows XP computer and had to return it to the store she bought it from. She works part time and fifty dollars is a lot of money for her. I'm just glad I was able to get a refund and buy her something nice instead.
3,Upgrading from an older version of Card Studio Deluxe,"I had previously put Hallmark Card Studio Deluxe on my computer. When I loaded the new Hallmark Card Studio Deluxe 2004, it did not automatically import any of the addresses I had entered into the event planner of the old version. I emailed Sierra who made the software, and they told me it automatically imports the addresses from older versions. Well, it doesn't. When I wrote back and said it didn't import them and how should I do it, they did not answer my email. I don't think they know any more about it than I do. I will have to retype all those addresses in again."
4,Easy to use for a beginner like me,This is the first program like this I've ever bought. I've only had it a few days but I already know my way around. Ton of cards to pick from and easy to customize. Calendar is nice from what I've seen so far.I'm using Windows XP but didn't run into anything like some of the other reviewers mentioned. It installed fine and its been working great so far.
2,Works great except,"I just purchased the Hallmark Card Studio 2004 (...). Everything installed fine but when attempting to print a card, the first side printed fine, but when printing the next side I keep getting the ""this program has performed an illegal operation and will shut down"". I have been in contact with their technical support but have not had any luck so far. I have wasted a lot of paper and ink so far in getting just part of a card printed. I am running windows 98SE. I will probably be returning this to the store (if possible). It looked to have some nice cards on it, which is basically all I wanted it for, but for some reason will not print correctly on my computer."
3,okay not great!,I would of loved this program but was disapointed when I realized it did not have business card program. American Greeting programs have it and its great. Unfortunately my husband lost the program. I purchased Hallmark software thinking the business card feature would be there and I was disapointed by such a big name not having that function.
2,Deception in Number of Cards,"The program works fine on Windows XP and is easy to use. It lets you print cards of many sizes. The big disappointment is in the number of cards that comes with the program. The back of the box claims ""4500+ Cards and Sentiments, Celebrate life's special moments with cards for all occasions"". That's nice. The problem with that is that I counted the total number of cards that come with the program. It only adds up to 1045! So where are the other 3450+ cards and sentiments? Are you supposed to design them yourself? I just don't know. And certainly ""cards for all occasions"" means just that, doesn't it? Well there's lots of birthday cards and plenty of holiday cards but not one sympathy card of any kind. I guess you just need to buy those on your own."
2,Hallmark Card Studio Delux 2004 (11-5-03),"Purchased this program for the event planner/address book. The problem is that when making labels from the book, you are unable to scroll through the address book list. Sierra has been made aware of this problem, but does not know when a solution will be available. If you are looking for a program strictly for the cards, this is an excellent choice."
3,Limited Use,"I just purchased this software and find that it doesn't even offer any July 4th ideas for invitations, cards or sentiments! This is the first software of this type that I've purchased and I would not recommend it."
3,It's good but it's outdated,This was the first ever Holiday release and it features 2 Holiday episodes; Thomas' Christmas party and Thomas and the Missing Christmas tree. These stories are good but you can now find them on the other 2 Christmas videos which are Thomas' Christmas Wonderland and Thomas' Snowy Surprise. The rest of this video is filled with other Thomas episodes that were on previous volumes. I wouldn't recommend this Thomas video since you can find these stories on other Thomas videos now and the best holiday release was Snowy Surprise since it features all Christmas stories including 3 new ones.
1,1 Star is Too Many,"When I ran Norton Clean Sweep 2002 it took over my computer without giving me the ablility to shut it down. When it was finished hours later, I had to reinstall my operating system just to get my computer working again. Then I discovered that Clean Sweep had deleted every program on my computer and 99% of all of my files. It has taken me almost 2 weeks to get my computer working again. I got no help from Symantec because they charge $35 per technical help phone call which I refused to do considering what their software did to me. I have used Norton products before, including earlier versions of Clean Sweep, with no problems. This product, however, is dangerous and untrustworthy. I highly advise anyone considering purchasing this to at least back up all of their data first and then buy something else."
1,"Pointless ""utility""","This bloated, poorly designed program doesn't really do much that the simpler Disk Cleanup utility in Windows already does. Just go to Programs/Accessories/System Tools and choose Disk Cleanup. You can then defrag your disk using the option right below Disk Cleanup on the menu, if you wish. These two options will take care of anytnig Cleansweep 2002 will--and it already comes with your system. This is a waste of money, disk space, and time, because it's slower. Don't bother."
5,Norton Clean Sweep 2002,"I enjoyed it greatly, until I had a system crash and tried to redownload the product, I found out that I could not redownload the product. The little time I used it, I loved it.5 star all the way.This has taught me to buy the cd, than download it, for there are times when this info will be lost and it can not be redownloaded again."
3,Worth a read,"It's not as good as the other books in the series, but it's not too bad, although it is rather predictable.The book is divided into two parts. The first part happens after book 8, when Obi-Wan is 14. The second part is three years after Qui-Gon dies, when Anakin is Obi-wan's apprentice.After Bruck falls to his death while fighting Obi-Wan, his father comes to the Temple to inquire into his son's death. He accuses Obi-Wan of having resposibility for Bruck's death. Obi-Wan is found innocent, but he has gained two enemies for life - Bruck's father and brother.And twelve years later, as he re-unites with two old friends, Andra and Den, aboard a huge ship where people may be held against their will, he also re-unites with his two enemies."
1,SORRY BLADES,"I guess that this is one of those instances where cheaper is not better. I thought that I was getting a real deal as the price was really enticing. But when the blades arrived, and they did arrive quickly I might say. I put them on my Sears 42"" riding mower and commenced to mow. But the blades did not cut properly (some of the grass was missed) in the strip that I was cutting there was grass that was only partially cut, and the grass was only six inches high. Also there was a lot of vibration. I stopped the mower and checked to see that everything was alright with the mower, and that I might not have installed the blades properly, but I could not find anything wrong. So I attempted to mow again but encountered the same problem. So I removed the new blades nad reinstalled my old blades and everything was fine. In my opinion these blades are junk and I will not purchase any more from Mowtown."
3,Thought I received two?,"Unfortunately I thought I was getting 2 blades as I do when I buy blades at the Home Depot, but I only received one, so it won't really do me any good unless I order more. My fault for not opening the box for sometime as I didn't need to use them, but when I did I was truly baffeled. I guess next time I will open box right away."
4,"Works well, but heats up","The 3-pin adapter works fine, but I am concerned about it heating up more than my original adapter. But no problems so far."
1,T61 powersource room heater combo,"Bought this just a few days ago and already noticed a major problem that I haven't seen in the reviews. The unit is getting very hot within 20 minutes. I really need to return this crap, but what choice do I have? My other AC Adapter's cable broke!"
2,"Poor Quality, Simply Sad.","This will be the fourth adapter that I have purchased. I have to admit that I haven't experienced the visual wires fraying, however, the issue was the same for me as far as the location. At the end of the laptop end, the connection simply failed. I was so frustrated on the 3rd one, that I opened up the wire to investigate, and it was definitely broken at the join. I was able to temporarily fix it, however, the cable managed to break again.After researching, it is most likely due to the gauge of the wire, and the amount of power going through it. If you purchase this, it will inevitably break, and if you try to fix it, you will finally end up with nothing left of the cable as you will have to continually fix it.My recommendation is to look for a kinsington or some other third party adapter. I am currently looking for a different one, however, in the mean time, I'm probably going to have to suck it up and buy another one.Good Luck."
1,AC adapter for T61: 42T5008,Today I saw the break in the cable. Just as everyone describes it - it is just below the grey jack (the base) that plugs into the laptop. I don't know if I am relieved to know that it is not only me experiencing this. I bought the thinkpad because it came with high reviews but I didn't expect this problem. I wonder if there is a generic charger that would do the job????
2,unreliable and short-lived,"My Thinkpad AC adapters last about six months: yesterday I've purchased my fourth within a period of two years. The cable end that plugs into the laptop stops functioning adequately after a few months, and after you get tired of jiggling it all the time you have no choice but to purchase a new adapter :("
1,Fake product,Please avoid this. The title said of it as being from Lenovo. Also product description said its covered by Lenovo warranty. However its a shame that it just a fake adapter. Its not even an OEM product. It comes wrapped in cheap plastic with no manufacturer name on it. Only the word 'Adapter' is imprinted on that black box thing you see. I would not use it as it might destroy my expensive think pad circuitry.
1,Works great...,"...until it doesn't. Unlike other reviewers, I didn't have any issues with fraying, but the adapter simply stopped working after about 3 months. Nothing visibly wrong, it just doesn't power the computer anymore. Of course, it died when I really needed it."
2,Poor quality,"I agree with the others who have had problems with the wire bending and breaking just past the plug that goes into the laptop. I've managed to get to the one and half year point, but bare wires are now showing through. These are too expensive to have them break this quickly!"
1,Worst purchase on Amazon Prime so far !!,"I bought this charger in September and in the first few weeks the AC power cable cracked and the bare wires were exposed. I asked the seller to replace it and he happily sent a replacement cable in 2 days.Now, the whole damn charger has stopped working. And it was a silent death. I am working at night and suddenly I see my laptop not getting charged. I check the charger and I find it that its not working. I dont know where the problem is, all I know that it starts with this seller.I hope no one else goes through this like I did, I feel cheated. I dont feel like giving even a single star !"
1,poor quality,"got one with my t61.first one broke after 6 months of light usage, replaced with lenovo warrantythe second one broke after 7 months, replaced with extended warranty from credit card."
1,Reliably unreliable,"Yep, same exact thing for me. Wire broke, as described, after 1.5 years. I know that this should just be about the power supply, but the Lenovo T61 has been a disappointment. Multiple issues developed after one year: not just the power cord, but screen backlight started dimming in particular areas and the keyboard and built-in mouse ""clicker"" starting wearing out. Lenovo has not carried on the tradition of IBM Thinkpad quality. I will be looking elsewhere for my next laptop."
2,Propper M65 field jacket,"I bought a brand new Propper M65 OD field jacket on line. After approx 20 wearings (I only wear it in my car to work and back; that's all. I don't wear it at work; I'm an office worker), the bottom snap broke. After approx five more wearings, the mext-to-the-bottom snap broke. I contacted Propper, but they said tough s***. Propper doesn't stand behind their product, is the bottom line. Just wanted everyone to know."
4,"Nice Jacket, Fits great.","I just received my Rothco /Ultraforce M-65 jacket with liner. It seems well made and should last a long time. I have always wore a size Large in coats and jackets. I ordered this M65 in a size Large. I am glad I did, because it fits me great. The arms are a little long. I read that they are intentionally made that way to fit over gloves."
3,Ehh....if you have EQ don't bother w this,I bought eq7 and was told by the manufacturer that this was a fantastic add on and that the blocks were not in eq. I bought the CD and perviewed the blocks. I must say that every block that is not a duplicate of the ones in eq are unusable and foundation patterns cannot be printed of them. For me this was a waste of money and I will be selling my copy on eBay.
2,MONOTONE REPETITION,The combination of monotonous vocals and meaningless/lame lyrics made it hard for me to concentrate on the really fantastic aspects of this album.
1,Work book,There is a conspiracy out there to make it impossible to buy this book for a college course any where but at the campus stores. I have not found where you are able to purchase the workbook seperatelly. Be ware if you are getting this text book used for class your instructor may require the Workbook also and that is sold packaged at about $200.00. Having had my Workbook stollen this publisher is not making my life easy as I can not find the stupid workbook to replace it.
2,Adventuras Workbook,Just got online and purchased two supersite passcodes from VHL Direct to enable my daughters to use the workbooks and get the homework completed. I would have purchased the books new had I known I would additionally have to purchase the site codes at $50.00 each.
3,"Aventuras - Required, But Confusing","Aventuras text is part of a ""hybrid"" (includes text, workbook, online, audio, and in class components) Spanish course I'm taking. The text has some very good visuals, is thorough, and holds my interest. However, I find it confusing because of its layout. But the text is required reading, so...."
2,Mediocre,"It seems that most modern foreign-language books these days are so preoccupied with having the pages filled with fancy-pants pictures, that they forget the reason why people are buying the book in the first place. Did I buy this book to see pages and pages of comics with little sentence bubbles coming out of their mouth? NO! Sadly this was the required text for my beginning level college spanish. It seems that this book would rather have you memorize phrases that you can find in travel guides, than learning anything about the actual spanish grammar, word order, verb-conjugation, etc...To tell you the truth, rather than using this book, I'd rather stock myself up on a good spanish grammar book, spanish-english dictionary, a few spanish audio cds to learn pronunciation, and one of those 501-verb conjugation books. This book just has to much BS to seriously learn spanish."
5,Totally surprised by my enjoyment of book,"I was totally surprised by my enjoyment of 'The Sanctioned Fruit'. It is an unusual book of poetry and a family history with pictures of the author and her family. I found myself reliving parts of my childhood, some sad, some happy. The poems of Nature and Nurture will make you want to go outside and play in the dirt again and watch for the sunrises and sunsets. And the poems of Death and Despair will cause you to murmur some of the prayers over and over again.'The Sanctioned Fruit' is one of the very few poetry books that I find myself rereading over and over. I'm sure everyone will enjoy it very much. I enjoyed it so much that for the first time in my life, I wrote the author a letter of thanks."
1,Poor Quality,"I bought this dress for my daughter's 8th birthday party. We were doing a costume theme. The picture of the dress gives you the impression that you are getting a great dress & floppy hat. The dress is made out of transparent netting so you can see straight through to the plastic cheap shower curtain-ish hoop skirt. The hat is a floppy mess. It is not a real hat, that would have been fine if the crown fit like it did in the picture. There was no depth on the bonnet so the hat was useless.My daughter with out any prompting was so disappointed. She said ""why did the company lie and send me this dress? It is nothing like the picture and the color is a different green"" (much brighter), she said. I packed up the dress and still need to mail it back for a refund. My daughter decided to make her own costume using one of my dresses. I would never buy on line with this company again. I will just go in person to the costume shops."
1,Poor quality and sounds like plastic,"Bought for daughter for Halloween and she refused to wear it because it was uncomfortable and it made plastic sounds when she walked. Very poorly made, disappointing."
2,A quick costume,This costume was not true to size. I ordered a 12-14 and it was more like a 8-10. Inexpensively made. Plastic inner hoop liner.... Not bad for something quick. I didn't expect the quality to be there. Does the job.
2,Cute dress but could be better,"I bought this dress for a program my daughter was having at school. It was cute and served the purpose but was not put together well. The seams were open where the material around hoops met, only tacked at ends to hold together. The shaw around the top of hat was not tacked and flipped from front to back so I had to tack it to the front myself. Before the program started my daughter stepped on the bottom of her dress once and the bottom border of the dress ripped. I had to sew it back on that night so she could wear it again for the program the following day."
3,"Cute, but paper thin",Don't buy this if you plan to use it more than once. And at 50 bucks that's quite an expensive one trick pony. Quality is flimsy and it'll be in shreds by the time your kiddo gets back home.
4,Nice Thin Spring Jacket,This jacket ran a little bigger than I thought but that turned out to be ok. I am able to put a sweater on underneath for those days that start out chilly then turn a little warmer later in the afternoon. Washes well in the machine if you use delicate cycle. Remove immediately to reduce wrinkles and hang or lie flat to dry.
3,To Cubanate or not?,If you like industrial/techno music this is the way to go. This ablum is fast paced with keyboard driven effects and guitar.
4,"fun, fast & furious coldwave industrial/rock","One of the things I read about Cubanate was that you can't tell whether you're hearing synth or real guitar, because they use both in a seamless integration of industrial & rock.. which makes this a great example of coldwave industrial.I agree with another reviewer that there are better albums, such as Antimatter (that's my opinion). However this has some hard driving tracks like Exultation and Vortech I, which is what I love about Cubanate.Fans of bands like Bile, Chemlab, etc. have to pick up some Cubanate if you haven't already. This is a fine album to start with.BUY THE CD, DON'T STEAL THEIR MP3s. this music deserves much better than 128kbit/sec compression."
4,"Good, but not their best.","Honestly, this cd spent the least amount of time in my cd player of all their albums. It's not bad, but it doesn't give you enough to want to come back for more. Great if you're a fan though. I wouldn't get this one first, Get either antimatter or cyberia first. Antimatter would be more apt in my opinion to be in the ""top 5 industrial albums ever."" My second favorite pick is ""interference."""
1,no wonder,"It's no wonder this is free -- old-fashioned and even occasionally maudlin, it is difficult to get through without wondering at its accuracy in light of more modern scholarship."
5,Good Read,"Amazingly true to the TV movie which I first saw in the early 70's as a child. Good read, very interesting and matter-of-fact. It tries to just present the case, even has transcripts from the actual hypnosis sessions the Hills underwent separately. Has several great pictures in the center. I read almost the entire book in one sitting because I was so engrossed. If you are a UFO buff, this story of the UFO abduction that started it all will surely arouse your interest."
5,I want to read a review of this book. Help!,I'd like to read a review of this book but can't seem to find one. Can anyone help me? Thanks.
5,"It's not Triumph, but it's Rik","Rik continues to inspire me with his lyrics and amaze me with his guitar-playing. This is softer than most Triumph work, but if you like Hold On, Magic Power and Midsummer Daydream (the sensitive Triumph hits), you'll love this. Out of the Blue gives me chills. Bang On got me through a tough period in my life. I love you Rik!"
4,good album from Triumphant soloist,"A good overall album. Changes from his Triumph days, but a good change. Mellow album, easy to listen to and the voice still sounds good. I really like this album, and look forward to hearing more"
4,"Overproduced, but excellent","Coming from a long time fan of Triumph, this review may be a bit biased. I always felt that Rik was the strongest artist in the older band, and his solo career has only reinforced this belief. Rik shines with competent studio musicians! The only complaint that I have is that the drum (especially the cymbals) sonuds are canned, and detract slightly from the enjoyment of several songs."
3,Two-Line Telephone,"I've had this phone about two years now and it is still functional, but there are times when line1 rings as line2 or vice versa. However, overall, it works pretty well. I don't know if I would order it again."
2,"phone okay, return request not answered","This phone is fine but I had thought it was a wall mount one. When I emailed, twice, about returning it & ordering a different one, I received no reply.I used the phone, but not in the area that I really wanted to put it."
5,PHONE REVIEW,I RETURNED THIS PHONE TO PRICE BREAK BUT HAVE NOT RECEIVED A CREDIT ON MY CREDIT CARD. MY EFFORTS TO CONTACT AMAZON ABOUT THE MATTER HAVE BEEN FRUITLESS. I HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO LOGIN. NO PHONE NUMBER IS AVAILABLE.I AM VERY UNHAPPY WITH THE SERVICE FROM PRICE BREAK AND AMAZON.
5,Works well,"Good, solid, attractive bike lock. I like it. Eight feet of cable allows me to secure three bikes together AND to the car (Honda Accord). If it had an extra couple feet of cable, I could also secure the wheels on all three bikes (not a problem if you're only transporting one bike... maybe even two). I like the rubber keyhole cover. The key was a bit stiff turning initially, but a squirt of WD-40 in the keyhole helped smooth that out."
4,Great for 2 bikes on the Thelma but not 3 bikes,"This is a very good light weight cable which can always leave in your car to secure your bike to the Thelma bike rack. It is long enough for 2 bikes to secure with the car hitch but since have the 3-bikes Thelma, you cannot secure it over the hitch but good enough to secure all 3 bikes together with the rack."
4,Good buy,works as advertised; the only problem I see is that it is a little hard to pull out the lock. other than that it works perfectly
4,A Question and Answers book of all things metaphysical,"I read this book a short time ago ( I still have the original old english copy ) and found it to be an extremely interesting analysis of all things metaphysical. It is actually an entire book of Rampa answering all the letters that he has received from his loyal readers and is more or less a questions and answers type of thing. Very interesting, whether you believe in Rampa's authenticity or not."
3,What is intelligibility?,"I was expecting to see methods for helping my daughter learn to speak, and this was not addressed. A lot of time is spent explaining what intelligibility is, and the rest of the time is spent stating what factors affect intelligibility. My rating would have been lower if some of the children weren't so cute."
5,Awesome soldering station,I have been using Edsyn equipment for years. If I had a choice I would never use anything else. NASA used these in space once and maybe still does. The tips never wear out. Have only had one heater open up in all the years I have used them. Edsyn is very helpful if you phone them for advice. Parts are available for most Edsyn equipment. An Edsyn soldering station might last you for a lifetime. Maybe longer.
5,Terrific Piece of Equipment,"I've had mine for over ten years, used many of the specialty tips (some look very strange, but do the task they were intended for perfectly).The iron itself is the best I've ever used - I'm 71 - been soldering since I was in my teens."
4,Power Corrupts,"This was a pretty fun horror-fantasy-thriller novel. A talented but unsuccessful musician, Billy, makes a deal with an angel and gains the power to do anything he can imagine. So he becomes a super-hero, minus the flashy costume and catchy name.The story takes a turn when the lines begin to blur between justice and brutality. The tension in the story builds as Billy's power gains power over him, and he starts to become a monster ruled by whim and cruelty.The story is quite captivating, and the writing very skillful. I had no idea this was their first novel, as I saw in another review. It was definitely hard to put down. A good short read, which you should pick up if you can find it."
4,great book.,"Skipp and Spector's vision of Manhattan in the late Eighties as seen through the eyes of ""tragically talented loser"" Billy Rowe is one of the coolest novels of all time. Horror, pathos, rock and roll, sex, New York, vigilantism, despair and redemtion . . . you can't beat it, without going to ""Deadlines"" or ""The Light at the End."" Highly recommended."
1,Plastic is not good,"The idea behind this product is great, however the plastic pieces did not work out good. They continually kept bending making very difficult to line up the grooves in the wood."
2,A bad idea,"I had to tear out a deck I had installed with these. The problem is while they space the decking nicely, they also keep it from expanding at all. The 10 x 12 deck I made with Bulletwood (a tropical hardwood being sold as decking in my area) expanded so much it pulled the joists right out of their hangers! I would check out the ""Tigerclaw"", a fastener that drives in with a hammer and doesn't fill the gap between deck boards."
2,Review of EB-TY Hidden Deck Fasteners,The finished results is just what I wanted. The installation process is tidius. It more than doubles your time to install. But I was installing a very hard wood (Brazilian Redwood). The only complaint I have is every box of clips only contained 90 screws instead of the 100.I bought 800 units and came up short 80 screws.
5,Hidden Deck Fastening System,Very good product. I liked this system because it is installed from on top of the deck. Great when you are only inches or a foot or so above ground level.
5,"Good belt for Haier washing machine replacement for ""Haier HAIER WD-0350-21 V-BELT""","this General Utility V-Belt (3L160) is the same size with my ""Haier HAIER WD-0350-21 V-BELT""This belt look like much better than the original one."
5,A Wonderful Training Guide,"This is a wonderful book when used properly. The book is to be used as a training guide for a class or workshop. The book is set up to work out specific excercises for a mock historical site. I took such a workshop through the National Trust in which this book was used. We followed along with the instructor (who used slides, charts, and yes, colored markers--see review below)working in team groups. It has been a valuable reference to refer back to. Even if you do not get to take the workshop put on by the National Trust you could adopt the book to conduct a workshop in your own organization. It empahsizes using historical materials and research available to you to create inclusive narratives based on facts and verifiable, giving authority to your exhibits, rather than leaving visitors with mistruths and misconceptions."
1,Jumpstart typing is not for beginners,"I ordered jumpstart typing to teach my child to type. It seems it is only for practice. Immediately they have your child practice combinations of letters, and never introduce them one at a time. The children can not access the games until they demonstrate a certain level of competancy (they need to type letter combinations over and over- even I was bored and I can type.) I thought the games were supposed to help them learn. I am very disappointed in this software and do not recommend it to anyone"
1,Worst tape measure I ever owned,"Perhaps I got a lemon. Nearly right out of the box my 30 ft LeverLock mechanism began to fail. At first, if I set the tape down with the rule extended, the weight of itself would release the LeverLock and the tape would retract! Soon after the mechanism refused to hold the tape extended at all. I have struggled with this tape for a year now and I have cursed it nearly every time I use it. The tape increments have also worn off to the point where on the first 6 or 7 feet I cannot read any fractional markings at all. If I could give this turkey ZERO stars I would. Mr. Stanley, you blew it on this one! I'm looking for a better tape right now."
1,Broke within a week - cheaply made.,"Broke within a week of moderate use. First it stopped retracting the tape - then the tape came off the inner tongue/catch. Ignore the Stanley ""lifetime warranty"", it will cost you more than $5 to ship it back. So it is not worth it. Spend more and get a better measuring tape. This one is a bummer. Not recommended."
2,Left Behind,"I'm in construction and spent several years working as a framing carpenter. I love working with a lever lock tape. Just pull it out and squeeze it when you want to reel it in.Unfortunately, either the tape manufactures have given up on lever locks, or; they just aren't paying attention.First of all, a 25' tape comes up short too often so a 30' is required for most jobs. A 35' tape is even better, but lever locks aren't made in 35' lengths.So, I have a 30' tape just like the picture. I did at least until this morning when my almost new tape broke. I pulled it out to past 30' and the ""T"" on the end of the steel leader sheared off. The resulting sharp edge cut the heel of my hand pretty good. I don't need stitches, but it won't stop bleeding.It may not help, but here it goes, I want a 35', Fat Max, leverlock tape engineered to work properly in the hands of an American craftsman. Is that too much to ask?"
4,"Compelling, Intense Horror.","Frightening Curves is a compelling mix of mundane and fantastical horror, not to mention a lovingly researched ""pulp"" novella, with a generous splash of paranoia and conspiracy thrown in for good measure.I found the first few chapters a bit bumpy, but after getting through them, the ability of Johnston and Chaudhary to draw the reader into the strange, ""up is down"" world that Phil London steps into is pure magic. (In fact, the prose and pictures are so gripping, that at one point I felt my mouth going dry and cottony with terror at the thought of the same fate -- the ultimate in loss of identity -- being visited upon me.)If the idea of The Twilight Zone meets X-Files by way of Clive Barker sounds like a grand way to spend an evening, then this is your book."
2,What a shame on Canon EP-E3,"I have just bought this new canon NP-E3, at the first glance I was so disappointed, it's made in CHINA, unlike the original one supplied with camera was made in Japan. I have not been trying to shoot to see how long does it last yet but if you think there is no different between the products made in Japan and China then you were totally wrong. I call Canon sale support and ask for this information, they've told me as what they see it supposed to be made in Japan. To be confirmed more information about this battery, I called Canon dealer BHphotovideo and Sammy's camera and ask for this. Guess what! They said made in CHINA. What a shame on Canon new generation. I hat off to you."
2,didnt like it,"i ordered a small one, i am skinny, and it showed my nipples, it wasnt really good to me, if you're skinny dont purchase this"
3,The Wood Finisher,"This book in not as easy to use as I would like. In some cases the information is embedded in personal stories and doesn't get to the point fast enough. There s/b more illustrations and step-by-step procedures. On the positive side, he offers many possibilities for solving your finishing problems."
3,Bread Upon the Sand,"I am happy with the book, however the description said it was autographed by the author. I seriously doubt the signature is that of the author. I have a copy of her hand writing and it DOES NOT match."
1,unoriginal,"Coffinberry's CD EP, entitled ""From Now On Now"" is quite simply, the worst record I've heard this year.Granted, it's only mid-January - there's a good chance some other band will top these Ohio based rockers in flatness and unoriginality. The seven-track album features a mix of blues, feedback, and straight up rock, but the poor production and throaty vocals of Nicholas and Anthony Cross makes Coffinberry sound like just another garage band. The extended instrumental jams are the musical equivalent of a speaker stringing one cliché after another. But in their defense, ""From Now On Now"" is Coffinberry's debut album, and judging by online forums, the group's Cleveland-area fans seem to appreciate their live shows. Then again, used copies of this album are selling for exactly one penny (plus shipping). You can make your own inference.The record is distributed by Morphius Records. For more information visit www.morphius.com or www.coffinberry.net."
2,Not reliable or long lasting,"I bought this drive about 8 months ago, and today it is dead. Though it had a good run, I would have expected more from it (especially for the price) The drive almost never reached it's max speed of 52x, and the drive did produce many coasters (ruined cds). The drive was also very picky about the kind of disk it liked to burn on, and would often come up with disk errors while closing a burned disk, or sometimes would not even start burning. I have used this drive with Toast and iTunes, occasionally with successful results, though often with not. Now it won't start burning, though my computer recognizes it, and it won't even read disks. I have plugged it into other computers to double check (making sure it's not just my computer) and it simply would not start burning disks. Avoid this one. The two stars are for the 80-100 successful burns I had with this (at a cost of about 50-80 ruined disks). Though now I don't think it will ever work again!"
3,Just a bunch of crap!,"I am a young 27 yo heterosexual male professional. I bought these for my new apartment. This set is dreck I get shpilkes just thinking about the money I wasted. you get a lot, but the quality is -10. THis is for somebody that wants quantity over quality."
4,Silversmithing,"As someone with no experience in metalsmithing of any kind, but skilled in another craft, this strikes me as a very well-done primer; the authors seem to answer questions just as they occur to the reader, and their explanations are clear and to the point.My only ding is that the current artwork looks a bit dated; if there's ever another edition, replacing it with more up-to-date illustrations and photographs would be a real improvement."
3,"oops, not for jewery","The 3 stars represent disappointment on applicabiity, not the quality of the book. I did find some useful instruction which will apply to my size scale, like bending flat strips, raising, tensioning and a few other things, but if you are looking for something on the wear scale, this ain't it unless you want to do really tiny teapots and bowls."
1,Still waiting for the old style to come back,"Like others that have commented, this tape is a far cry from the original. I remodel kitchens and bathrooms...also have a shop for building cabinets. My partner and I used the old style Leverlock until the new improved version came out. I bought as many old styles as I could find at hardware stores and on eBay when the change was made. Now we are out of good tape measures. My partner buys a simple green locking tape from Wal-Mart, and I struggle with the old remaining tapes looking for a good replacement tape insert that isn't the cost of a case of beer. I have used a few of the knock-offs from Sears, but they seem to have stopped making those too (black wasn't any good anyway). One of the biggest problems I had with the ball shaped new style was I couldn't quickly set it on a counter or bench. It would roll off. The old box style just stayed there. Sorry Stanley, get some new engineers to re-think the tape measure. This is like the New Coke."
1,SCAM,"The picture you see is NOT what you will receive. You will instead receive the newly designed Leverlockthat is poorly made and which you can buy at any hardware store for half the price. The people who are advertising this product have been notified more than once that the tape measure shown in the photo iswrong, and yet, there it still is. DO NOT BUY THIS."
1,"Junk, junk, junk!","Stanley: Why do you sell such poor quality JUNK! I have been 30 years in the custom picture framing business. Before this i use to be in the cabinet business. ALL Stanley products ""use"" to be #1 i my book, buttttt now, Stanley has been put on my s*** list! What a shame..."
1,Recent production not as good as the old,"I purchased this particular tape measure recently to replace one that's the same model, which I have been using for 10 yrs in outdoor construction. This one broke after 1 week because the spring could no longer retract. In addition, the gauge of tape and its coating was not as good as the one I had before. The production quality of this tape measure is nowhere as good as it once was. It's a pity because the design was awesome: compact, ergonomic, easy to retract, clear tape markings, etc."
2,not the worst but sad for a famous name,"I must agree with the majority here. I'm always ready to try an ""improved"" model -- but this has broken now after very little occasional use and will no longer lock. I'll be looking for something like the old style to replace it. You can certainly buy worse/cheaper tapes than this but it's sad to see what has become of what used to be a quality product."
1,Old style rules. New style stinks,I have also been using the old style of stanley leverlocks from there original production.I am a professional plumber and use a tape constantly in every type of situation. When i saw the new style tape stanley created I thought that it looked great but soon found out that they were a peice of junk the aforementioned button was a big hang up for me i would cut off the clip that would hold the lever in place. but over all the whole design is flawed. The old style of leverlock held up much better. I keep my old leverlock case and purchase the stanley powerlocks and change out the guts but my old case is almost woreout and no longer locks with the lever so i am looking for a replacement now. i wouldent have a new style leverlock if you gave it to me to much of a headache when it fails on the job.i have had the case i have now for about four years and changed the blade about once a year. I suggest that you steer away from this tape if you use one a lot.
2,Not the correct item,"The Stanley leverlock shown in the picture is not what you are going to get. What is shipped is the ""new"" model, which does not work as well and is not as reliable as the ""old"" model."
3,Compositions: Outstanding! Performance: Mediocre,"These are some of my favorite pieces of music. Sadly, I found the performances on this disk lacking. If you are interested in a romantic interpretation of the slow movements, getBéla Bartók: The Six String Quartets - Juilliard String Quartetinstead. If you like the violence of the fast sections, tryBela Bartok: The 6 String Quartets - Emerson String Quartet.But for a truly inspired performance of all parts of all these compositions, I recommendBartók: 6 String Quartetsby the Hungarian String Quartet - that's my favorite!"
4,"FInally, a book on WWII torpedoes","Anyone with an interest in WWII submarine stories and history has read tales of the multitude of problems with US WW II torpedoes. They ran too deep, the new magnetic exploders didn't work, and sometimes they would run in a circle and sink the submarine that fired the torpedo. Even the old WW I era contact exploders were troublesome.But it has been difficult to find out anymore about this subject until the publication of Hellions of the Deep. This book takes an detailed look at the development of US torpedoes, which are much more complicated devices than most people realize.The writing is a tad dry, and a few names of people who 'helped develop' (read hindered) the troublesome torpedoes are withheld, which is why I only gave it four stars. But overall, a valuable book to serious students of WW II naval history."
5,A complete account!,"This book is as complete a work on the development of USN torpedoes used in World War II as one is likely to find.The work covers the topic in a clear, easy to understand format delving in to the development of these weapons systems. It covers the technical developments without becoming so technical as to make the text difficult to read.This book will make any reader aware of this story and the tecnology/development of a weapons system that is often mentioned but rarel explained in any depth."
1,It is sung in English!?!,"Unfortunately, I did not notice the 'Language: English' warning in the product description before I ordered this item and upon receiving it and carefully reading all reviews, I realized that very few reviewers bothered to mention that 'minor' detail. I wonder how many reviewers would have found it noteworthy to mention if an opera by Mozart, Beethoven, Wagner, or Strauss were sung in English."
5,Not just okay...Pretty damn good!,"I have to disagree with the above reviewer...I think the album is great. For starters, if you haven't heard the original version of the songs on 'Revisted', i suggest you check em out. Great songs, as is most of Cam's work. Secondly, the remixers selected for the album are all top notch. DJ Premier, Kid Loco, Theivery Corporation, etc...all cream of the crop...so what do you get when you put it all together...a pretty damn good album. It may not be as exciting as an album of fresh new tracks...but still a worthwhile collection...especially for Cam fans."
3,It's Okay.,"i can't believe the name of lable that released this album is called ""Recall"". what a name. This CD is alriiiight....i don't think you should expect too much out of this. Voodoo Child was nothing new, just like the one on Soulshine. as a matter of fact, i never heard of voodoo child in Dj Cam's original version. Overall, if you are a fan of DJ Cam, it's worth it. but i must admit that i was disappointed a little. not his fault, since its remixes done by others.But there are some phat remixes done by J Dilla, Kid Loco..."
1,An Utter Disaster,"I am off to Africa, the Taita foothills below Kilimanjaro, where I plan to spend a year or two working on a novel. Can't be lugging my Bartlett's, so I opted for Oxford Quotations on CD. Install it to the hard drive, or onto a flash drive, along with Mr. Webster and the Rand McNally World Atlas and a few other choice references.Then I discover that Oxford Quotations must be online. Online? I won't even have electricity. I'll be recharging spare laptop batteries by solar panel. Transferring the reference CDs to a flash drive was intended to minimize battery consumption. If there was anything in the marketing material about the quotations being online only, I certainly didn't see it. I thought I was buying a CD of Oxford Quotations, not a CD that simply installs a program for searching for quotes online. I already have an online quote reference, and it is called Google.This CD is worthless to me."
3,Packaging is cheap and ridiculous,"Rick James, is Rick James. We all know what we are getting, sort of. Because there is absolutely no information on this packaging. Not a word. All that I know is that Al Gore and his bio-battalion have let me know it's green. Would you believe even the year these songs were released is nowhere to be found. I have to go to a website, where there is no information, because that is written by the same imbeciles. Absolutely ridiculous, and they are wondering why they are losing money. I could burn a CD from my other records and tapes, with more information than this.Other than that a braided Rick James adorns the cover. He might as well be Dave Chapelle.I'm taking off stars for packaging."
4,Great Deal,"Materials were received a bit later than I had hoped, but the book is in excellent condition and has been useful in maintaining my grade."
1,THINKING FOR YOURSELF... THE TEXTBOOK,"I always find it amazing and ironic that there are textbooks teaching you how to think for yourself.A bit ironic, don't you think?"
5,F-A-N-T-A-S-T-I-C!!!,"This book does to college football what Pavarotti did to opera. The authors have captured the essence of tailgaiting, partying, and eating Chinese food in the back of a rundown limo.Reading this book is like being on tour with the authors...What's next? Movie? Play? Book on college tennis? I can't wait to read their next work."
4,Saturday Afternoon Madness Hits the Nail on the Head,"On top of being one of the outrihgt funniest sports books I have ever read, the authors have done a superb job of putting in to words why college football is such a passion to so many people. It is not only the game but the pageantry, the lore and legend, the people and most of all the FOOD that make college football the most beloved sport of all.I have been to many of the venues that they visited and can say with confidence gained from experience that no one captures the essence of the aura surrounding college football like these two."
5,Must Read,"This is a definite must. Finally, a scholarly study letting Scripture teach and not a bogus of opinions..."
3,To avoid confusion...,"Please note that this seller and any item entitled ""Mother Beads"" is not in any way associated with Mother Beads, Inc. and does not contain lampwork beads made by Mother Beads, Inc."
4,Good deal. . I bought 2.,"Though I can't evaluate the accoustical effectiveness of this ligature much because this is my first non-metal ligature, I got it at a good deal (about $27 for 2, including shipping). . One oddity in the design of this product is that it doesn't fit along the lattitudinal indicator lines on the mouthpiece, so it is skewed when it is installed."
2,dont give up,"If you are new to the Samples DONT START WITH THIS ALBUM. Good or not I don't feel this offers a good ,uh, sample of their work. I have been listening to the samples for ten years and I LOVE them. Go buy ""The Samples"" , ""The last Drag"" , and ""No Room"". You will not be disappointed."
1,Horrendous,"I'm one of the biggest Samples fans you'll ever find, and have been for about 10 years now. This CD is garbage. I mean, really, really bad. And yes, that's painful to say. I had to pop in The Last Drag just to get the taste out of my mouth."
2,For die-hard fans,"Well, I don't think that this is a particularly interesting live album. The sound quality is very muddy, and there are no classic songs like ""Boys don't cry"". It's no a bad album, but it doesn't stand up to Cure's studio standard. I enjoyed the video tape much more, because the visual element of Cure's concerts is very important. After all, this CD is a worthwhile purchase for fans, but the rest of the world doesn't need this, believe me."
5,Great Live CD,"I have this and PARIS and both are great live CDs. This one is a good recording with a great song selection. It must have been fun to be there. It contains most 'hits' but is not a greatest hits CD, rather it is a journey from an english band that never got the credit they deserved. The Cure can really set you back if you give them a chance, so fone a live CD and sit back for a ride."
3,"mostly uninspired, but worth getting","The Cure has a reputation for being one of the best live bands ever; although a CD of a live show (or, in this case, 2 shows edited together) can never substitute for the real thing, the intensity of their live performance usually shines through. Not so in this case; it's an unfortunate compilation of mostly-uninspired performances of their singles. It would be a 2-star rating if not for the incredible performance of From the Edge of the Deep Green Sea, which makes this CD worth owning for any Wish-era fan. If you want the singles, buy the studio-recorded compilations (Staring at the Sea and Galore)."
5,Perfect in every way.,"Robert Smith takes all his emmotions and lets them all out in this live performance.The highs, the lows and everything inbetween will leave you breathless, and wanting more."
1,Extol no more . . . .,"You can tell Extol lost both of their previous guitarists on this recording. Ole was the driving force for Extol and you can tell he, more than anyone else, has left the band. His influence on The Blueprint Dives is non-existent. The songwriting, clean vocals, and guitars are second rate in comparison to earlier releases. I truly miss Ole's voice, guitar playing and influence in the song writing on this album. Unfortunately, I hear nothing special or unique in The Blueprint Dives. It is boring and lacks the essential elements that originally made Extol a great band. Very disappointing."
1,Metal...?,"I don't want to go on a curse course about Extol, just quickly point out the things that made me rate this the way I did. The guitars are noticeably less skilled than when Ole and Christer were playing. There is no distortion to make this a ""metal"" album, it's really just a watered down set of strummed chords in each song. It's nice to know that Peter Espevoll can sing cleanly, and it makes you wonder why he didn't do it before and Ole had to do it all, but nonetheless ... Ole's voice was so epic and noble seeming. Peter does okay, but it doesn't really save the music. The double bass drum kicks are completely gone. I read somewhere a comparison to newer Deftones, I would say that accurately fits this album. I listened to Extol to be what they were, or at least still resembled it as they progressed, this is really nothing like Burial, Undeceived, and in all reality is considerably less heavy than even Synergy. K that's all."
3,Truly hit or miss.,"Im dissapointed that the band abandoned their stong fan base, but they are progressing steadaly though the world of alternitave rock. Some may like it, and some will despise it. It's not bad, but I just with that they could return to their creative style of melodic metal."
5,Favorite Dog Toy!,"My little terrier loves this toy! She also has the ""small"" plush beaver (just a little bigger) which has been one of her favorites for a while. The size and shape of it makes it easy for her to squeak and carry, and easy for us to throw. This is a nice size toy for small dogs, however if you have a medium to large dog, I would suggest the larger toys."
5,a little bit of california country soul,"Listened to the Amazon clip of the song `Midnight California' and promptly downloaded all three albums. Totally agree with the other reviewers here: this guy gets it right, it's all there: the cracked voice, the tunes, the song writing, the playing, even the stoner West Coast cowboy image. Rockabilly, jingle jangle rock, straight country done better than any of his heroes and peers whom he clearly loves. So if you're searching nostalgically for some overlooked country rock classic, wondering why they can't make them like they used to, well they can, this is living proof. All three albums are terrific, though this one may be my personal favourite. Put it on, shut your eyes and find yourself in the Joshua Tree under those desert stars."
1,ProDriver,"This is an expensive, but very good glow driver. The problem is that the batteries last 1-2 years and replacement batteries are never in stock from Radio South. Unless you want to a standard 1600 mAh NiMH battery (which is way too big and you have to tape it to the side of the glow driver), you've got nothing but an expensive paperweight!"
3,You've Heard It Before.,"If you're at all familiar with Satriani's work, you won't find any surprises here. The simple fact is, this album won't bring in any new listeners but will satisfy old fans. Read the other reviews and see how everyone worships this man.While I dare not call the album repetitive, it is derivative. While it thankfully does not follow the experimental wanderings of ""EoC"" none of the songs approach that album's ""Borg Sex"" or the flat out rock of ""Crystal Planet"". There isn't anything here as playful as ""Summer Song"". The ballads are the lone saving grace, but overall the whole album just feels like filler.If you're a Satch fan, you already own the album. If you're not you should check out his earlier work."
5,Awesome ......simply awesome!!,"I bought this CD, after buying Extremist and Surfin' with the Alien, and I was simply blown away. Do the songs have some catchy hooks to them? Sure, I'd say so. Is Satch one of the greatest (and more underrated) guitarists on the planet. Absolutely. If you are a Joe Satriani fan, this is definitely a must-have in your collection. It has rarely left my car CD player since I got it. Simply love it.Also, a reviewed below said he paid $25 for the CD - not sure where. Even at B&N;, it's $18. Either he got gypped, or he's lying through his teeth."
3,An album fair enough to listen....,"but not good enough to be called a great album. Although a good buy to add to your Satriani collection, it's not good enough for a stand alone. This individual songs seems choppy at times and even seems to have stolen a couple riffs some, most notably, Bob Dylan's All Along the Watchtower on ""Chords of Life"" and ""You Saved my Life""."
5,Joe Cool #2- J. Montana is Joe Cool #1,This record is a SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCE - This cd will go in my cd rotation for about the next 25 years.
1,Strange beautiful music,"Being an avid Joe Satriani Fan I can only state I was hugelydisappointed with this album. Many tracks are slow and excessive use of the distortion pedal is made of giving the songs a distinctively fuzzy and annoying sound. The only track on this album that has the original fast paced catchy J.S. feel(As in the albums Surfing with the alien,Flying in a blue dream and crystal planet) is Belly dancer. I know artists need to experiment with new sounds and techniques, but this is a bit over the top and as said, vastly disappointing to the hard core fan."
5,All Hail Joe,"I am astounded by the creativity of this work. I ordered it yesterday morning when it first came out, and paid one day shipping. I hope I was the first one to hear it. lol. I own all of his records. I play guitar, and am no where near to his abilities on the guitar. My fav joe cds are his newer ones, crystal planet and engines of creation. this one just tops it all off.Heres the bottom line. If you play guitar and need some insperation, or you love great guitar playing, get this cd NOW."
3,Not the satriani of old,"I'm amazed that so many people give this album a good review. Where is the Satriani of old, the edginess, hunger and precision combined with amazing songcraft. I've no doubt the skill is still there but the sound isn't (these later albums have a sound reminiscent of a muffled car horn!) and the songwriting is hit and miss to say the least. On earlier albums there were no misses only hits and if I was choosing a best of album I'd struggle to pick any songs from this album as none of them stand out. To all Satch novices try his earlier albums first especially ""Not of the Earth"" and ""Surfing with the Alien"" as this album is not a fair representation of his talent."
4,Not Strange To Me,"I agree that the music on ""Strange Beautiful Music"" is beautiful, but I doubt that anyone the least bit familiar with Joe Satriani's work will consider it at all strange. Most tunes would be easily identified as coming from Satriani by his fans on the first listen, but the music here is more diverse than Joe's previous offerings. I couldn't part with that 5th star because that diversity tends to break the album up a bit too forcefully. I can't help but think that a different sequencing of the tunes would have helped the flow. Still, it's certainly worth the purchase price for those addicted to the electric guitar in the hands of a master."
2,Stanley 60-060 6-Piece Standard Fluted Screwdriver Set,Stanley 60-060 6-Piece Standard Fluted Screwdriver SetWorth the $3... Poor quality metal will not stand up and last long. The wall mount is useless.
5,I'd buy these again.,"I use these screwdrivers to repair electronic equipment in a warehouse environment. They've been thrown on the floor, used as pry bars and mistreated but they still function as long as you use the correct driver for the screw you're dealing with. No complaints here; I'll buy another set if I ever need to."
4,Made in the USA,"This is a decent set of screwdrivers. After 3 years, I am down to three (I lost two and bent one*), but they have been sufficient for most jobs. They are made in the USA, they are relatively inexpensive, and they get the job done. What more can you ask for?*When I say bent I mean that I warped the straight edge of the flat head screwdriver to where it was more of an S-shape. This only happens if you use a screwdriver that is too small for the intended target, so it was user-error."
1,not acceptable,"the book was admitably a first edition paperback, but was missing pages 73-80; if it had the missing pages, i would classify it as readable, not acceptable."
3,Review of RF,"Although I knew this was not Robert Frost's complete works, I would rather have that product available. This product is incomplete, several poems are cut short and not all there."
2,These wings are not white,"These wings are less white and more fleshy pink with purple highlights. I bought them with the matching tail looking for costume parts to go with a silver dragon mask, and they're not the right color at all. Very disappointing!The wings are only textured on one side (the front) with the other side being mostly smooth. It's not noticeable from a distance, but once you're up close, it's not a great effect.The rubbery texture is durable, and looks like it would last quite a long time. I've used them for two halloweens (without the non-matching mask) and they hold up well to abuse. The harness that holds them to your back consists of two velcro straps, and it is quite sturdy. I would recommend hiding the harness by cutting two wing-holes in an old jacket or something for a better effect.Now to find some white dragon wings that actually match my mask. Maybe I'll cut these wings apart and use the sturdy wire frame inside the rubber to build something better."
2,"good story, poor quality product","Cute pictures, nice idea, but manipulatives are not quality materials. They're made of thin paper and tear easily. This needs to be a board book made of stronger paper. I bought it to use with students, but it's not made well enough to use more than once."
5,Too cute for little girls,Purchased this ages ago but failed to rate - this is such a cute toy for little girls 2 and above - been a favorite of our granddaughters.
5,A Huge 5,Frank Sinatra is One of The Greatest Artists Ever.His Voice&Music Speak Volumes of Nothing but top Notch Quality that is Dearly missing from Todays Music.This Two Disc Set is a Must for all.The Richness in Sinatra's Phrasing is A Quality that Very Artists ever Achieve.He was a Genius of Sound&Time.His Voice is a Timeless Treasure.
4,"Ooops...I wanted his ""young"" voice","I'm a neophyte when it comes to Frank so I bought this 2 cd set instead of the Capitol set based on what many of my fellow reviewers wrote. Most of the raves were about Sinatra's mellowed, mature voice and phrasing. That is exactly what this music is and, oops! I was looking for the peppier, more swing-like songs of his younger days. So, these cd's are fine, but not what I was craving. Wish I'd known the difference and am hoping this review helps other folks."
3,"Not good for a beginner, but otherwise nice recordings","Being new to Frank Sinatra, I was expecting a lot out of this CD. However, after hearing it, I was left with more of a depressed feeling than one of the upbeatness I was expecting from Old Blue Eyes. This is not a good album to buy if you are new to Frank and considering this as your first purchase. With MANY of his greatest hits missing and 2 very popular songs that are different versions, this may seem akward and disappointing. However, if you are a long time fan and have many other albums, this is a quality album."
3,Its not yet the greatest collections for me.,I love Frank Sinatra's songs so I bought this CD thinking that it will have all my favorite music. But I am quite disappointed because some of the songs in this CD did not have those songs that I want to hear over and over again.
5,hey,hey jr im the biggest fan of your title I love your music im sorry I misst your consort but I was out of towon
5,Frank,"My husband LOVES this cd. I bought it for him for Christmas. The only disappointment for him, is that I didn't buy the Dean Martin CD also!"
4,THE VERY BEST...of slower songs,"i love the frank sinatra classics like you aint seen nuthin yet, and under my skin, so i got this. i was expecting lots of swingin upbeat sinatra songs, but most of the songs on the 2 cd set are very slow songs. not this may be a good thing for you, mabye not, it all depends on what mood of frank sinatra you wann a listen to. but hey, its frank so you cant go wrong."
3,disappointing,"I gave it 3 stars only because its Sinatra. The voice is there; the band plays, thats all. Uninspired, mechanical, the studio cranked out an album. Look for something else if you want to hear Sinatra in the kind of form that made him the greatest crooner ever."
4,We Love You Frank !!!,"Ahhhhh they dont make em like Frankie any more and they sure broke the mould when they made him. I was taken by surprise recently, having watched the movie ""What a Woman Wants"" and I was totally hooked. I got Sinatra fever and found myself playing New York, New York and Strangers in the Night so loudly reality melted into the background. What's even more scarey is that younger and younger generations are enjoying his music and are not afraid to confess it. So yes, I'll do it my way and confess I get a kick out of you, a passion I dont think I'll lose to the summer wind and I want to be a part if it. Cliches aside, this is a wonderful double cd with all the old classics that thrill and remind you of an age when singers like Frank were common.Definately one that you'll get under your skin."
2,"I know it was ""like New"" used.",I was going to give it as a christmas present but the CD case is broken! it was packed with another order and probably got banged around. will have to try and find another case it may fit in.
5,Amazing collection for an amazing performer,"I'm sad to see that this collection is no longer in print. So, I'll tell you to go and find it used... it's that good. This is a very complete collection of Frank's work. From up tempo swingers to the slow romantic ballads, you indeed do get the very best of Frank Sinatra. I have listened to this 2-disc set over and over again and it remains timeless. Hunt this set down and buy it. You'll be glad you did!Top Tracks: Wee Small Hours of the Morning, Luck Be A Lady, The Best Is Yet To Come, All The Way, Strangers In The Night"
5,"Excellent CD, Excellent service",The CD is just what I wanted. The product was described prefectly by the seller. It arrived when stated.
5,Simply Fantastic!,Superb collection with that one and only a man who will forever be known to music and voice you know when you hear it. These songs are certainly some of his best and most loved songs.
4,"Good, but ""The Capitol Years"" is Better","This is a very strong selection of songs, but I find that I like Sinatra's younger voice better. Not that his voice is bad, but seriously, if you listen to the Capitol recordings alongside these, it's obvious his voice was richer, clearer and stronger in his younger days. Some of these versions have too much of a 60's Vegas feel to them, ""I Get a Kick Out of You,"" and ""Come Fly With Me,"" in particular. Yet others like ""Witchcraft"" and ""Luck Be A Lady"" are sheer perfection, and those along with ""New York, New York"" are meant to be cranked throughout the house.Despite my preference for the younger Sinatra, I think this is a fine addition to ""The Capitol Years,"" which does not have several must have songs present in this collection. Together they make a pretty complete collection."
4,GOOD ALBUM BUT NOT FOR STARTERS,"This album has many great cuts and few which are nice but not classics - e.g. GIRL NEXT DOOR.Skip this one, buy the VERY GOOD YEARS and if u need more, go directly to the albums as originally released or try the SINATRA REPRISE COLLECTION or THE COMPLETE REPRISE STUDIO COLLECTION."
5,Frank Sinatra is awesome,"I used to be into rap & heavy metal, but after listening to Sinatra, it seems to me that he is the very essence of pure, beautiful music. This album was my first, and it's great to start out listening to Sinatra with. But I plan to purchase all of his albums sooner or later; this is one artist that will be here forever. I STRONGLY suggest that you purchase this album; I promise you will enjoy it."
2,Aoyue 768,I bought this soldering station one year ago. I used for 5 min. Today I turned on this soldering station.After 2 sec its dead.Its worked only 5 min and 2 sec.Possible internal power supply is dead.
4,Care Bear Sings alongs II Cheer,"I bought one of these for my little granddaughter, from another store. She loved it so much that she carried it everywhere and she memorized the songs....but it didn't even last a week, when it died, and new batteries didn't help. So we sent it back and ordered another one from Amazon.com. She has had this one for a month, and so far this one is working just fine and my 2 year old granddaughter is very happy."
5,Fun with Pinky,Good size toy for toddler - vibrant color - cutsy and adorable I bought this for my one year old granddaughter - she held it the minute the wrapping came off - its adorable - even the older kids ranging in age from two to five wanted it for themselves at Christmas - a beautiful idea
4,Smells Good!!... but a little on the sweeter side..,"Smells Unique... Diffrent from others, However smells a little on the sweeter side and on me dosent seem that strong...i actually perfer my ""Bvlgari Pour Homme Soir"" because the scent seems to be stronger and i want people to notice rite away :D.. but then again everyone has there own opnion on things... so yea ""Kiton"" very Good Choice! not very well known from alot of people"
3,O to yuck in twenty minutes,"I tried this at Barneys, because I was told that it's just like Green Irish Tweed (but much cheaper). Indeed, it does smell like GIT, for about twenty minutes. However, after that, its synthetic quality rears its head and comes on strong. After twenty minutes, it starts to smell like a cross between GIT and Chrome, which I loathe.If have a twenty minute long date, and you want your date to think you use GIT, use Kiton.If you like Chrome, you might be fine with this stuff.Isn't Kiton known for making some of the nicest OTR suits in the world? Why would they make an inexpensive (bad, derivative) cologne?"
5,Fast delivery and great product,this was a christmas present for my boyfriend and arrived promptly and correctly. I'm pleased with the transaction. Thanks.By the way I love Thais fragrance. Stays with him for a long time.
1,FAKE and Worthless,"This is a typical bad knockoff - the packaging is perfect an the product sucks. These people should be thrown off of amazon, but there is no amazon contact to whom I can follow up. DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THESE PEOPLE"
1,bad experience,"The first time I used this product it shorted out the lighter in my car. The plug for the lighter did not fit properly, overheated and shorted the system. The refrigerator never cooled. Additionally, the refrigerator hold much less than you would think."
3,No Adapter,It's true no adapter and no way to get one. No way to order on company's site. Can't find in any store on the web.
2,Only comes with car adapter,"This product only came with a car adapter so if you want to use it with a normal outlet, you have to buy an additional adapter. Amazon does not appear to sell the adapter for this item. I bought this thing and it's just sitting in a corner until I can get an adapter for it. I wish the previous reviewer had said something about it...instead of ""buy one for your house""...thanks buddy.Update: I contacted the company and a wall outlet adapter will cost an additional $...+ shipping. Radio shack, circuit city, etc do not sell an adapter that will work for this item."
1,No adapter,"No adapter and absolute no information in the package on where to get one, or even whether it's safe to use one. Complete rip-off."
3,Well it wasnt horrible.,"Maybe I expected too much out of this book, but its no more then I expect out of the other Dodd books I have read. While this story was not terrible, it was not even close to what she usually writes. Maybe I had too high expectations, but I felt this story fell short. It did not have much depth and was all over the place. The characters were not as well developed as they could have been. I think this was suppose to be more of a comedy, but came of corny. I did enjoy the story, and although it had a slow start, it does get better, a little anyway. I just thought with a title like ""The Greatest Lover in All England"" it would be one of the best stories I read. Well the Greates Lover was a dunce most of the time, unless he was trying to use seduction. As a man in any other situation, he did not measure up. He had quite a ""duh"" capacity. Rosie was alright. Nothing special with her either.Not the worst I have read, not the best, but so far my least favorit of Dodds books so far."
4,Had it for 4 months but........,As of Sept 2003 the PC would not power up. So I have to ship it to HP in CA to see what's the matter. Thank God it's still in warranty! The tech support was good and I hope the repair will be the same.The reason I gave 4 stars is because the shared graphic card can't be upgraded.UPDATE: You can upgrade the graphics by adding a PCI card. I added an ATI Radeon 9250 Diamond Stealth with 256MB of memory. Now I can play those games wich gave me an error saying my video memory wasn't enough to play the game although Doom 3 still gives me fits with choppy frame rate now and then.Next upgrade will be a bigger hard drive around 400-500GB. You'd be surprised how fast you can eat up a 60GB hard drive with only a handfull of games loaded!
1,Not worth it,"I wanted this so I could listen to AM radio in the gym, but the reception was terrible. I was surprised since I've used Coby products before and had no problems.This unit actually works OK outside when jogging, but once indoors, AM reception is very poor."
1,rubbish,"Dear Reader,Save your money. This is just another, in a long line of, cheap and not truly functional products from abroad.Rubbish."
1,Poor reception,The reception is terrible. I am close to the transmitting station and the reception breaks up a lot. Would not recommend buying this radio.
1,Save yourselves - this radio is a dud!,"I wasn't expecting much, but the reception is terrible in both city and country. The volume is literally silent at one and two bars and then jumps to quite loud at three bars (of a possible sixteen). I suppose this means you could really crank it, but I can't find a station that isn't nearly all static. The buttons feel very cheap and make popping noises in the headphones every time you press them. Design and weight are tolerable, but I'm kicking myself for buying this. Verdict = spend more."
1,Forget About It!,Had this item for about 3 days and it fell apart. The earphone cables split out from their base making them completely unusable. Not a well made product. I would suggest not wasting your time or money on this one.
1,Don't buy this,The radio arrived and did not work. Totally dead. Don't waste your time and money on it!
4,Perfect for the gym,This radio works great for the gym. I can tune into the television and rock while sweating. Perfect size!
1,Disappointed,"Don't be fooled by the picture of the CX-9. The radio doesn't have a smooth, aqua backlight for the LCD. It's actually a rough, uneven green. For what you get, the CX-9's price is too high."
2,You get what you pay for,"Well, I didn't pay very much for this, and I didn't get very much. The uber-cheap headphones stopped working after a week or two. The reception is ok at best, even when outside. The radio can't seem to handle to cold weather very well and shuts off after about 15 minutes in the cold. Would recommend you spend more money and get something with more quality."
1,Product is poorly made,"Within a month of purchasing this item, the light that shows which station you've accessed burned out. The radio is operated by push-button tabs rather than dials and has no visible window that shows labeled radio frequencies. When the light fails, it's impossible to know where you're moving on the radio band. My radio stopped working completely a week or so after the light gave out."
3,large and loud,"The radio's easy to use, but the volume doesn't get quiet enough to use in an office setting.It's also a LOT bigger than most MP3 players on the market. But at this price ... you can't complain much."
1,Don't buy it.,"The radio is huge. Larger than a hard drive mp3 player.If you are moving, the sound would be pretty bad. Spend a little more and find something else. I'll never buy a product from this brand again"
3,Not the best at holding a weak signal,Pros:Relatively smallEasy to tunePlenty loud with a good signalCons:Flimsy earbud wire broke very earlyDoesn't hold marginal signals well
3,Not too Good not too Bad,Pros- Clock- The number of preset stations (10)- Neck strapCons- Poor reception (specially AM)- A little bit big for a portable radio- Scan not too exactly
4,Coby CX-9 Mini Digital AM/FM Radio,"For the price, a nice radio. Its digital tuner works well and has lots of memory to save stations to presets. Has a clock display when turned off. All push button control, and a lock button, so nothing 'moves' while jogging with it, even without the lock on. Decent reception, but it seems lose reception if carried in a pocket. The belt clip works OK, but it came off once; I used the lanyard as a safety tether so it didn't hit the ground. The sound is pretty good, but not 'high end', the DBSS switch adds subtle bass. The included earphones are cheap, and better replaced with something decent. So far, the battery life seems good. All in all, I like it and spent a lot less than the going price for other 'jogging' radios."
1,"Yikes....was hoping for a good deal, turns out it doesn't work",oh man! i knew this was cheap...but i assumed i'd get regular radio stations. reception is awful. do not buy this.
2,I wouldn't recommend it,"How can such a simple item be so badly constructed?I bought this for my girlfriend, who was using an mp3 player with FM radio before. Since I noticed that she never used the mp3 -just the radio- when that gadget became malfunctional, I decided that a radio-only device would be just fine. There aren't many options here in Amazon, this one is almost one out of two portable digital radio-only devices. First I was surprised at its bulky size (check this if you plan to buy it anyway) I expected it to be no bigger than the mp3, but this is LARGE. Well -I said to myself- with such size it surely has better quality. Hell no! I couldn't syntonize one single station without hearing a loud ""zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz"" of interference. The old mp3 with FM had much better sound..."
5,Everything I needed,"This Coby radio does everything I need it to do, so I'm very happy. I have a Sirius radio mounted to the windshield of my motorcycle. I had my earphones plugged into it but it did not work out all that well. Adjusting the volume on the Sirius is not easy, nor does it go loud enough to hear at turnpike speed and above. I also couldn't stand the cord flapping in the wind or unplugging it to get off the bike. So I got this little gem and set the Sirius to broadcast on 88.1FM.I have the Coby clipped to the right forearm sleeve of my riding jacket and set to pick up the signal from the Sirius. It goes plenty loud. It has buttons that I can operate with gloves on, has digital tuning so the station doesn't drift. I have a set of Etymotic 6isolator earphones and the sound is decent. And it was only $13. Oh, and it also has a clock."
1,Don't buy it,"Audio quality is unacceptable. Looks nice, but can't play sound from a nearby strong station in the Bay Area. We bought two, and will be returning them."
1,"junky, not that there's anything wrong with that","Perfect if you don't need to have good reception, good sound quality, and don't want to pay a lot. The up and down volume settings are either too loud or too quiet. When you change the batteries you will have to re-program the clock and preset stations."
1,Reception would be nice.,"Cheap...no reception, no ability to tune in to the stations at the gym...waste of time and money. I threw my away."
1,You'd be better off with a tin can and a wire hanger,This radio is pure garbage for AM radio. I tried using it at the new Meadowlands stadium and couldn't pick up the local AM game broadcasting. My cousin next to me with a Sony radio picked it up perfectly.Don't waste your money.
2,OK for price,"I'm having a hard time finding a good portable radio. In the age of MP3 players finding a good radio is like looking for the holy grale. Anyway, I bought this one at CVS for $10 and it works ok for it's price. However, even the station broadcasting only 10 miles away are fuzzy, especially if it's cloudy or going to rain. AM stations are the weakest and I can't get the stations in from only 10 miles away either. I would say as a general rule, don't buy Coby, not even for jogging purposes, the stations don't stay put, they get fuzzy or fade out."
3,Exactly what I had expected,"The other reviews I read prior to purchasing this product were very helpful and my expectations were met satisfactorily. I wasn't looking for anything state-of-the-art; just a simple AM/FM radio to take to the gym. This serves the purpose at an unbeatable price. The only negative aspect of my experience (which I had anticipated, thanks to a user comment): the earbuds broke after about a week. No big deal; just something to consider before purchasing."
3,Poor Reception,"I bought this because I needed to hear some morning radio. However, the lack of an antenna or the one built into the headphones doesn't cut it. I have poor reception so I opted for another one with a traditional antenna. Now things are fine. The unit itself is also bigger than I thought it would be... rather bulky. I had the idea that it would be small and tiny since it was an FM radio only... but it is thicker than a deck of cards and rather bulky."
1,Poor execution,"Don't waste your money. I thought that this unit would be really small and compact but it's actually just average. You certainly know it's hanging around your neck. Also, the reception is about as poor as I've seen in a portable."
3,Good for the price,"A little larger than I expected, and the FM cannot pull in one of my local stations that I receive ok on other radios. The supplied earbuds are very poor - I prefer to use my own ones that hook over the ear, and they are louder than the ones provided.Apart from that, what's to say? It's an AM/FM radio at a good price, don't expect a lot.I don't get the promo on the Amazon page, where they are selling one of these for $12.45, or you can take advantage of a special deal where you can buy two for $27.33! Something weird there."
5,Some great Songs,"I've danced to the music, and they make great dancing songs. If you need fun Irish Dance music, this is the c.d.! They've got great tunes right here!"
2,Poor production from a talented group,"After seeing Leahy on PBS's ""Gael Force"" , this album proved disappointing to say the least. Ten painfully repetitious tunes, of which only half could be called Celtic. A few are downright depressing. Definitley not an album to play at parties. Look for my copy for sale on Ebay!"
1,Was this recorded in MONO,"I'm afraid I was dissapointed with this CD. The music while having momentum, lacked energy. I admit it was fun watching them on PBS. One easily was taken up with their fast pace performance. Seeing them perform though, masked the fact that the album felt very flat. There was little heart behind the music. I'm sorry to say this is one album that I should not have purchased."
2,Poor Produciton from a Talented Group,"After seeing Leahy on PBS's ""Gael Force"" , this album proved disappointing to say the least. Ten painfully repetitious tunes, of which only half could be called Celtic, and several are downright depressing. Not a CD to play at parties. Look for my copy for sale on Ebay!"
5,I saw them at Shania's concert last night!,They were soooo great. They got everyone up from their seats and dancing in the aisles! They are very talented musicians and I think its cool that they're all brothers and sisters.
5,Excellent CD - Motivating,I saw Leahy open for Shania on the 20th and the next day bought the CD. What a talented family. The sold out audience at the United Center loved them.
3,Drumming and bass playing needs work.,"Not in the same class as Dervish, Planxty, the Bothy Band, Tannahill Weavers, Solas, and many, many other Celtic bands, but not bad. The bass and drumming on this CD are monotonous and the keyboards are too loud, fiddle not loud enough. Good first effort though."
5,Amazing,"Not quite as stunning as their live performance, but certainly the next best thing. Leahy's music is creative, entertaining, and addictive."
2,much better in concert...not on a CD,"I thought the music was rushed and not capturing the true talents of the artists. I would defintately recommend their concert (live) becasue they are amazing, but would not recommend this particular album."
1,No more!,"I have purchased Hoyle card games in the past, but after this one, I done with them. I was unable to install this game properly using Windows XP. The suggestions the ""techs"" gave me were of no use and almost condensending."
4,Hoyle puzzle games,I love (most of) these games. A couple of the games seem rather pointless but my favorite is the Star Collector game. I also like Rays and a couple of the Tile games. I've owned this for several years and put it away sometimes but so far have always come back to it and enjoyed it again. I've certainly gotten my money's worth out of it.
1,Must have CD in drive to play game!,"I purchased this and Hoyle Casino 2004 for my sons for Christmas and was very disappointed to see the CD must be in the drive to play this game, even after full installation. Corporate greed is alive and well at Sierra!!!"
2,Not worth the price,"I got this line because it came with the String level, which I have yet to use. I'd recomend a cheaper string line, this one reels in quickly, but it's not that big on an advantage, I find it difficult to get the handle out to reel in the line, and it doesn't lock very well.It does the job but so to many less expencive chalk lines."
1,piece of junk,"I bought one of these last year, and when I went to use it, it is terrible. When you pull the line out, chalk goes all over the place, and it is a big, fat, fuzzy string that leaves a big, fat, fuzzy line. totally worthless."
4,Enjoyable romantic comedy,"War Between Men and Women is a warm hearted romantic comedy based on the works of James Thurber. Similar in style to the old tv show, My World and Welcome to It, the film incorporates animated figures representing Thurber's drawings and commentary on the eternal battle of the sexes. Jack Lemmon is perfectly cast as the ""man"" who hates women, children, and dogs but falls for Barbara Harris, the ""woman"" who comes bag and baggage with all three. If your a Barbara Harris fan and consequently regret she didn't make more movies, this is the picture that proves she had the talent to be a star. One sour note, this video has been edited for content. Some scenes have ""offensive"" bits of dialogue bleeped out. In other words brief silence on the soundtrack"
4,Bitter sweet comedy in a classic sense,Jack Lemmon and Barbara Harris were a perfect match in this classic comedy. The special effects with the cartoon drawings incorporated into the movie were excellent. I first saw this movie when I was a kid and it still makes me laugh.
2,glad I tried it,"I enjoy reading different books written about the 23rd Psalm. This one, though was not my favorite, although it's just me. Not my type of writing; I've enjoyed others on the same subject much more. It was inexpensive enough to find out, though. I know many enjoy his writings."
5,One of my all-time favorites!,"David Roper is one of my favorite authors and this book is simply incredible. I've read this little book four or five times now and have given away at least half a dozen copies to friends and even strangers. Each time I've read the book, I walk away just amazed at the deep insights and spiritual truths that David conveys. I highly recommend! This is a special book and I'm so grateful for David's deep understanding of God and his special ability to communicate this with others."
1,did i miss something?,"I am on page 256 and there are 311 pages--nothing has happened!! I was halfway thru the book earlier in the week and was going to give up, but I hate not finishing a book. There is nothing more unsatisfying than a bad book. The book is about a family coming together for a wedding and each family member has a little bit of their own drama going on, but by page 256 nothing has really happened, so I am putting this book down. I'm sorry, but this book just did nothing for me."
5,Read this book!,"An enjoyable and a remarkable book. Ginger Strand's narrative catches up in a weekend's time the history and the relationships of a family, each of whose four members are engaged various confrontations with issues of marriage, divorce, children, and career. But this is not a polemic: it lives and breathes. Ironic but compassionate, the stories of these lives resonate with us, reflecting on our own encounters with essential issues. Particularly skillful is the gentle, gradual revelation of the father's never-discussed experiences in Viet Nam and their unacknowledged resonance in the life of the family. The book resonates too, long after you've finished it."
4,Great treat dish for canaries,"Use this dish several times a week to serve fruits, veggies, eggs, etc. to my canary. Easy for my bird to eat from and easy to clean."
3,Not a bad First Aid Kit...just not a good one.,"A bit bummed about this one. It has 160 pieces and includes some useful stuff...the tweezers are plastic... no butterfly type suture bandages... those are really nice for when you have a split skin injury, they hold the wound together until a pro can assess the need for stitches.A BUNCH of cheap tiny (like cut yourself shaving sized) bandaids and even more of the standard, buy them anywhere for a buck, bandages.But I guess the point of this kit is to meet some sort of law for businesses, not to give me a decent car kit for the family..."
5,Lost in the Texas Desert,"I bought this for my teenagers, and they just loved it. It had mystery and history together and piqued their curiosity to learn more about Texas explorers. This state park became more than just a place to play, but became a place of wonder. Now they want to learn more about desert survival tactics. They now believe in miracles."
2,'Too Many Notes',"When Mozart heard other composers of his day, his description of their works was simply, 'too many notes'. ""Lost in The Texas Desert"" by Tom White left me with that exact feeling. To be concise, too much froth and not anough pith. While I loved the premise of this book, I was sorely let down when it wasn't developed. I think Tom White gets too bogged down with long and rambling descriptives and loses site of the message he intended. The reader gets glimpses of awe, spirituality and a genuine epiphany but these are few and far between and the surface is just scratched and interest peaked when drowning by words, takes over. I wanted to love this little book with a giant message. I didn't."
1,"Nope, Sorry. Keep looking.","I bought this book with the hope that the reviews were true. Oops. Wolfson has a problem with two things: punctuation and clarity. The punctuation can be forgiven as the overexuberance of the non-professional writer. (His use of exclamation points reminds me of a bad paper in a freshman lit. course.) The main problem here is his clarity. He's just not good at explaining things. Further, he has a tendency to meander away from the point and toward minutiae. The result is that the reader is left muttering, 'Hey wait a minute...Go Back. WHY is it that way?' The book promises to clarify relativity - and while it's clear that the author is just having a wonderful time - the book fails. Keep looking."
5,Best thing ive bought this year!,"This is by far the best purchase I have made all year. This has answered so many questions for me, and I plan on re-reading it several times throughout the next few years. It completly changed the way I think about life and physics. I love it!"
2,What Happened?,"I never thought I would say it, but - I really don't care for this new album by one of Hawaii's premier vocal groups. They mention in the liner notes about ""going in a new direction."" Well ladies, in my opinion it's the wrong one. They've hooked themselves up with a new producer, and guess what: it's over produced! Synthesizers, unnecessary string arrangements, etc. - you get the idea. Na Leo has gained many fans over the years with their great vocal harmonies and they just don't need all this extra junk! They even felt compelled to remake one of their most beautiful classics, Flying With Angels. This whole album ends up coming off like just one more pop song confection with little substance. Na Leo: don't forget where you came from!"
4,Great for a stretch with your sweetie,"This is a fun little book filled with mostly stretches that you do with a partner. While not the Yoga I was expecting, it is fun to do the stuff together.It is especially useful in that I have tight hamstrings and I get her help with stretching them out under the guise of being close and intimate heheGet this book if you want to spend more intimate times together increasing your body's elasticity while improving your closeness with your SO.Do not get this book if you are expecting a yoga work out or tantric sex poses. You will be disappointed."
3,Not what I expected,I thought this would be a little more in depth. But it was more like a pocket book you would pick up on a spinner rack. It's not very detailed and does not really give new poses. I wouldn't recommended paying a lot of money for this one.
1,mine burned up,Bad product. I'm glad it's not available any more.It is a fire hazard.Mine burned up. Thank goodness someone was there when ithappened.
5,LOVE IT!!!,"I got this as a Christmas gift from my father and fell in love with it!!! The sound is great, the picture is great overall it is a great machine for it's price!!!!! So far I have had no problems what so ever!"
5,Not good for hiding,Wasn't bought to conceal the piercing but wanted to note that is still very noticable
2,Wasn't as described,"I expected to receive what's in the picture, and I did get a clear tongue ring, but there was a big jewel in one of the balls and it's not what I expected. It's cute, but it scratches and irritates the roof of my mouth and it's not what I ordered, so I was disappointed about that."
3,BUYER BEWARE!,"Unit does not include the adapter needed for home use! It is pictured in the ""see more pictures"" section but doesn't come in the box. Very dissapointed that I waited several weeks for this and now I can't use it. I left three stars since I can't honestly review the quality of the unit since I can't power it up. I'm waiting to hear from Amazon about this."
2,"Beware of ""Up to 45 degrees cooler""","I purchased this to use in wetbar area so I don't have to keep mixers in the kitchen refrigerator. Unfortunately, the unit only cools to about 55 degrees, which isn't low enough for orange juice. The room is about 78 degrees, so it should cool to around 40 degrees. It doesn't. I guess when it says that it cools ""up to 45 degrees cooler than the ambient air"" it means that is the maximum...of course it might only cool 25 degrees cooler."
3,Great Idea - deceiving advertisement,"I received the product and I'd like to think I'm going to be happy but don't know since I can not plug it in. Bought to use in my office at work, but the product advertised ""(optional AC adapter available for indoor use)"" but didn't come with one and I can't find where to buy it. VERY FRUSTRATING. Product listing doesn't offer it and I don't believe Amazon does either."
2,Wagan fridge,"This seemed to be a nice product that appeared to have been made with a good grade of quality. However, I received a defective fridge. The cord immdiately became hot and I smelled smoke. Because this fridge was a gift to my husband for his office (work), it was too much of an electrical fire risk to keep. Amazon responded with an immediate refund."
4,buy this product!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,this is an awsome peice of work the person who thought of this is a genious and i would like to thank him/her because i have perchased this product and it has lasted a long time all the other ones that i have bought have broken in a weeks period of time.
5,Uplifting and encouraging,"The author surely has given us a gift. Shared wisdom is wrapped up inside with practical guidance for all. Biblical principles not only empower you, but will inspire you to raise your children with confidence. Be encouraged......It's exciting when someone really opens up and shares their heart! Parents, make sure you read this uplifting book."
5,A great book for anyone who loves adventure!,I really was amazed by the way Hattie dealt with all the joys and tragedies of traveling to Oregon. This book is a good starter for people who are hesitant to read Dear America diaries.
5,Wonderful Book,"We read this book for our education class at the University of Mississippi. Although this book is aimed for children ages 12-13, it is good for any age. Hattie Campbell explains her adventures in such a way that it motivates anyone who is reading this book to become interested in the westward movement. As teacher candidates, we quickly realized that this book could be integrated into all subject areas. This book helps children of today relate with Hattie and the struggles she faced in the 1800's. This selection is an easy read and once started you will not want to put it down until the last page is read."
3,"The story is nice, but I was offended.","Kristiana Gregory writes a nice story. There are statesments in this book which express many untrue ideas about Latter-Day Saints, mostly through the eyes of characters. I don't know why such hatred was used. Gregory's story does teach about sympathy and learning kindness towards others such as the Native Americans and thre elderly. Her story also illustrates the hardships and trials of the Oregon trail. I wish, however, that she had a better understanding of the Mormon trail and the hardships of the Saints who travelled there. Some information is inaccuarate, but on the other hand, most reviewers have overlooked that and focused on the sweet sense of the story and heartwarming tone of the overall message. It is a good book, though it does offend my religious beliefs."
3,Not A Book For Children!,"People endured unbearable difficulties traveling by stagecoach from Missouri to Oregon in 1847, and this book accurately describes them. I felt what it must have been like to be dirty and covered with mosquito bites, sunburnt, and having to walk on blistered feet day after day for six months.On the trip I got to know Hattie, her family and some of her fellow travellers fairly well. I was hoping the book would be heartwarming, but although there were a few heartwarming moments, the book wasn't heartwarming as a whole.I wouldn't recommend this book for children to read because of the number of deaths in the book. Approximately 88 deaths are described in this 140 page children's book, one especially gruesome. This is an excessive amount for a child to read about. As an alternative I highly recommend the historical, heartwarming ""Little House On the Prairie"" series."
3,Across the Wide and Lonesome Praire,"Have you ever wondered about how it was trying to cross-country in the 1840's? Or are you interested in the ""Dear America Series""? If you answered yes to atleast 1 of the questions I asked you'll hopefully enjoy this book. This story is of Hattie Campbell's journey cross-country to Oregon. I would like you to meet the upcoming characters. Meet Hattie Campbell and her friends!Let's start with Hattie,she is the story teller in this case.She is 13 years old and traveling across the praire with her family to Oregon. Next I'll tell you about Pepper. She is 14 and traveling to Oregon also.Did I mention that Pepper becomes Hattie's best friend?There are more characters and adventures as you read this book. I would recommend this book to 4th grade and up. Why? Well, I would recommend this book this way because it's educational and exicting, but has hard words."
5,This is such a great book!,"I loved all of the characters, settings, and details. Sure, it got a little depressing sometimes, but how can you tell the truth about the Oregon Trail without getting sad? I cried and I laughed. I got so mad at Mrs. Kenker sometimes! Why does she have to go around taking stuff from good people? But I'm sure that happened sometimes on the Trail too. It's hard to believe it's fictional whaen it seems so real."
5,this is a great book,"Although I read this book a few years ago, it is still one of the best boooks I have read yet. The characters are well developed and it is filled with fact and fiction, humor and sadness. Rating: EXCELLENT"
5,Yet Another 8th Grade Review,"I really liked reading this book. I give it 5 stars because the Donner family are canibles. Anyway it is about this girl who gets excited about moving to Oregon. Her grandpa falls out of his coffin in the begining which causes them to move. Along the way she makes a friend and they make all sorts of plans for when they get there, but something happens and Hattie, the girl's plans are ruined. So Hattie doesn't know if she will make it. Read this book!"
4,An author's imaginary journey across America.,"As a native Oregonian, the attraction of reading a diary of one who made the Oregon Trail journey was met with eager anticipation. Early on, the diary though very interesting, soon became a series of calamities that left the reader thinking, what else could this poor family possibly endure? As the journey continued, it became apparent that the author had taken great liberty and creative license to spice up this historical adventure. By the end of the diary it was discovered that this work was fiction, which resulted in great disappointment, leaving the reader feeling mislead. As a work of fiction based on possible Oregon Trail experiences, this book proves to be entertaining, however it is not a true diary."
5,I remember the effect this book had on me,"It has been years since I have read this book. I can still, to this day, remember the effect this book had on me. I was eight or nine at the time. I remember reading the diary entries and feeling as if I were right there next to Hattie, walking in the dirt or the snow. I cried at times when something bad had happened to Hattie or the people around her. I felt compassion, and found myself wanting to reach into the book and help the people myself. I learned many things about life in that time period that I had never known. I had learned about pioneers in school, but I never imagined that it would be as hard or as rewarding of an experience for them to go through.The book made an impact on me from page one. I highly recommend it."
5,The best book I've ever read!,I've read the entire Dear America series but this book was my favorite.It was so realistic that I felt as if I was there with Hattie.I loaned it to both of my best friends and they loved it too!This was one of the best books I've ever read.I would recommend this to anyone who loves to read about American history.
5,ABSOULUTLY FANTASTIC!!!!!!!!,"This book is about a girl named Hattie who goes on the Oragan Trail.In the book (her dairy) she explains everthing she sees and goes through wether good or bad.But what really makes this a good book is how the author tells it like she IS Hattie and she's the one on the Oragon Trail writing every sight she sees,Making you understand what it was like for those people on there long,tiresome journey to Oragon."
5,GREAT! as if you need more convincing...,"I think this book may be one of my favorites, and believe me that's a good compliment! Matter of fact, I liked it so much I read it twice! That never happens with me! I love how the author (Gregory) describes the characters and truly writes the book as if it was a Oregon Trail girl's real diary."
2,Disappointing,"I am a Rammstein fan. So, I ordered this DVD on its release date, only to find out that it is an unauthorized Rammstein biography. There's no music, band member interviews, etc. It was very disappointing to press play on my DVD and see the message ""this is an unauthorized biography"" followed by a menu to access the biography, a fan quiz and discography.Feel free to pass on this one."
1,CRapmstein,Rammstein is an embarassment to Germany. They're some gloomy metalhead band that wears neo-fascist gutter uniforms while blowing up boxes on stage.Avoid this.
5,Great!,I bought this years ago for my son who rides his bike at night to and from work. It's still holding up well! Excellent purchase.
5,Essential for any professional assisting a Family Business,Outstanding work and an easy read. Understanding the many dynamics that can and often do take place in a family business is very critical. The family members as well as the advisers need to be familiar with the challenges and issues they are sure to face. This work should be required reading for any professional that assists family businesses. I will give a copy of this enlightening work to all my family business clients.
5,"Really, everyone should own this...","My favorite by Current 93 (or anyone else for that matter), one hell of a piece of work. Profound and inspiring. Great production, great packaging. A little bit of everything stylistically, but it all flows together quite well. Quite a bit of care went into the production of this. Hard to take pop music too seriously after hearing it, everything else seems pretty shallow by comparison... Tibet (and all involved) ought to be very proud of this effort-it's an impressive document that will stand the test of time..."
4,Real Track List,"You guys at amazon made a mistake using the first verses of the main track as the tracklist of this cd.Here it goes the correct track order:1 The Long Shadow Falls2 All The Pretty Little Horsies3 Calling For Vanished Faces I4 The Inmost Night5 The Carnival Is Dead And Gone6 The Blood Bells Chime7 Calling For Vanished Faces II8 The Frolic9 The Inmost Light10 Twilight, Twilight, Nihil, Nihil11 The Inmost Light Itself12 All The Pretty Little Horses13 PatripassianI like this ""Apocalyptic Folk"" cd better than the previous no-sense noise experiences of Dave Tibet. Pretty nice contribution of Nick Cave!!!"
3,Not my childhood. I watched Thunderbirds.,"Fools you into thinking it's going to be another Thunder Perfect Mind (a classic, Kalki aside) but fizzles after the sixth 'song' with too much repitition. Captures a good 'Swallows And Amazons' vibe though, and the tapeloops are up there with Douglas's stuff. ""The fire especially does not save."" Put that light out!"
2,WARNING!,"This is a VERY sweet and affecting series, but at the ""end?"" of Ai Yori Aoshi Enishi we have essentially the same situation we started with, save that one of the girls discovers/suspects the secret engagement.Some people prefer an open, even a VERY open ending. The ending here was either a hasty wrap up after the plug was pulled, a purposefully intense tease to make sure we break down the door when part 3 is released, or the creators' admission that they don't have the talent for a follow through.My whole reason for delving into a 'harem' series was that this seemed like one that wouldn't leave things hanging. It is NOT."
1,"""Shipped"" but actually out of stock","We were excited to find a source of Patak Balti Sauce, a cooking ingredient, in the US, and ordered some jars. We were notified that they had been shipped, and given an arrival date approximation, but they never arrived. A few weeks later, we received an email from Amazon telling us that the item was out of stock and that we would have the cost refunded. We did receive the refund. We wish we had been told at the outset that the item was not available."
3,There are two variations of this collection,"Well I have one of the variations and I like long versions of them hit tracks (which are many) so the shorter ones are.. okno one can have ever missed ""Miss Me Blind"" ,""Karma Chameleon"" & ""Do You Really Want To Hurt Me"" the classic mixes.All those new versions my apply to the dance floors but to have the real nostalgic sound I prefer the original album & 12"" mixes.Call me oldfashioned but remixes can be good & bad depending who speaks their mind. Giving it 3 is minus for the missing track listinigs on this one & lack of any information at all. Makes hard choice for customers to buy it ;).---- Still I cannot see the tracklist on this one !? ----"
2,only one of a hundred and far away from the best,There are a lot of very good books which give a insight into the F1. This book is only one of a hundred. And it is not the best! The writer has written informative but not enthusiasthically! No it isn't convincing!!
3,Poorly Edited,"I was rather disappointed in this edition. For whatever reason, time signatures, accentuations, rhythms, and even keys have been changed from the original script. If you just wanna tinker with the tunes for your own enjoyment, this book is fine; however, if you are trained enough to know there is a big difference between 3/4 and 6/8, then this book disappoints. Also omits War Is a Science, Finale (Think About Your Life), Glory."
2,Gravy without the biscuits,"The good thing about this read was creative dialog between characters. The bad thing was that there was too much of it--too much talking and not enough action. Also, you have to realize that the protagonist, Faro Blake, is a card sharp and not more ""westernized"" than say a Longarm or Slocum, so I guess it's inherent that there would be less action. That said, I can't see staying with this series, but you might if you are really into cards.Whatever you do, if you get this book, don't read the back cover. It gives away a twist that is later discovered. This is just bad marketing. **"
5,Excellent value,"I can only recommend this trumpet for any parent with a child starting in a school music program.The sound production is surprisingly good.Nice case, at this price you have to ask yourself: Why rent?!"
5,Very nice beginner trumpet,Very nice. I am completely satisfied in the trumpet and the case. It's what I expected and what I got.
5,Great student trumpet,"For the price, its a great starter trumpet. My brother received this and is very happy with it. I recommend this trumpet to new players because of the affordable price."
5,Great quality,"My wife got it for me as gift. I will say the I am not an experienced player. I am also not a child. This is my first instrument. Nevertheless, I am an engineer that designs acoustic transducers and I can tell that this is great craftsmanship and emits a great sound. I have been using it for a few months and it works perfectly. If you buy this for a beginner, get them also ""Sound the Trumpet: How to Blow Your Own Horn"" by Johnathan Harnum. This book will make it fun for the beginner to learn, it has tricks, info on what music to listen, as well as care, troubleshooting and cleaning instructions. It is a trumpet user's manual."
4,Good for price,"Before this trumpet I owned a high-quality Yamaha student trumpet. It was only slightly better than this one and it cost about $700 at the time. But I lost that one, so now I bought this one. I started playing trumpet in 5th grade and am now a 4th year college student.The main gripes I have is that not all of the notes are exactly centered on pitch. The low Ab especially is almost a low G! I really have to bend upwards to get the Ab to sound on-tune. But anyways who really cares about low Ab. There were some other notes but they were not drastic. All in all, rather good quality for the price, even if you're not looking for a ""starter"" trumpet. This should suit your need as a very economical purchase unless you want to move into the $1000+ pro zone."
4,The sound quality of this trumpet is great!,"This trumpet was purchased for our son who has been in the band for his third year. The sound quality is great. He is able to hit the G note now with ease. The case is very durable with plush lining. I think it's strong enough to withstand backpacks, football gear and whatever else he has to carry."
5,Great value for the price,I am very happy with this purchase. The trumpet arrived quite quickly and it is a great value for the price. I would recommend it to other beginner trumpet players. Why pay $600 to $800 dollars when you can buy this trumpet for much less? The case is nice as well. Hard case with plush interior. Some of the other less expensive trumpets were not being sold with such a nice case.
2,so disappointed!,"When I ordered this item for my great-grandson, it was supposed to be silver. I didn't check to see if I had received the correct color, but found it was NOT SILVER when he opened it today. Did I make the mistake?Bonnie"
3,not the best trumpet,if you got this trumpet most band or chorus teachers would not allow this trumpet in there class. if you want a good trumpet get one at least 300.00+ for a good intermediate trumpet but it still could be pretty good because i havent purchased it and if it sound not right you could bring it in to a local music store and ask them to tune it up.
4,Hutchen Bb Trumpet,"Quick delivery. Valves started hanging soon after my 13 year old grandson started to play. Disassembled, lubed it, and reassembled. It worked great after some confusion on the reassembly process. A manual explaining this step for novices to trumpets would have been useful. Overall, it seems well engineered and crafted and we are pleased with the purchase."
4,"Great horn, great service","Great product and great service. Purchased this item for my 10 year old, mainly for school. The cost of rental was basically the same as purchasing. My decision to purchase this product from this vendor was based mainly on the overall postive reviews of others. Once I received the item it was in fine working order and exactly as I expected. The quality of both the horn and the case was very good for the price paid. I live in Toronto, Canada and after doing some research this was the best deal I could find on both sides of the border. Along with this order I purchased an Amsco Fingering chart that my son found very helpful. If you are a beginner or are purchasing this for a beginner I am sure you will not be disappointed with this purchase."
2,small small,"You have very little room in this case, just enough for the camera without the adapter, no room the sun shade. difficult to close and the zipper not sturdy"
4,Good product !,"According to the description, this case is for a Panasonic DMC-FZ7 but it can also hold a DMC-FZ8 perfectly!!! The only problem I see is that there is no much room to hold something else (like another battery pack), besides this its hard surface protects the camera very well."
4,Sutherland's Lucia,"I have a CD recording of her Lucia, but without Kraus. She is in good voice here, but not as good as earlier in her career--to be expected. Kraus, even at his age, still sings well, as do the others in the cast. Sutherland's singing was always superior to her acting, but who's complaining? I recommend the DVD."
5,I was there that night and Sutherland was in great form...,"pushing the music and the melodrama for all it was worth. And with Alfredo Kraus on hand (the most consistently splendid and underrated of the great dark tenors of his generation), and with Bonynge in the pit this was a grand and moving event. There was excitement too, because it was not clear where the next generation of leading divas was coming from at the time, and the Met audience savored the evenings when true representatives of the age of great singers were on the boards, in good health and good voice. Sutherland was always in spendid voice, but she did not often immerse herself in a character like Freni, or Price or Tebaldi were able to rise to the great moments. Here she did, and it is a transcendent memory. I am going to buy this. I will let you know how it holds up. I saw the Pavoratti version (in his prime) and he also could milk this opera for all it was worth, despite his curious inability to really inhabit the character."
2,Lucia di Lammermoor,"This in my opinion, a very ""dark"" opera house. When I was there it looked very cold and unimpressive. The orchestra was R Rear on stage!This disk is dark."
3,"No, I rather listen to her recordings","I'm annoyed and angered by this ignorance that is being sold as the ""truth"". Joan Sutherland was already singing for years in 1959 and Callas didn't ""quit"" because of her. Callas sang her last performance in 1965 but never officially retired. (There were plans for Norma, Medea etc.) And the 1971 Lucia is NOT the bestselling Lucia of all time. But even if it were: Charlotte Church's ""Opera-Recitals"" outsell Sutherland (NOT Callas!) by far, so Church is ""better"" than Sutherland? Get real!Callas doesn't crack on 25% of the E-flats, there are only two in Lucia di Lammermoor and she always sang them well. And it's called verismo, such ignorance is LAUGHABLE. And guess what, in ""verismo"" you NEED a great technique as well. Ask Caballe, de los Angeles, Tebaldi ETC. Etc.This DVD was recorded too late and shows us a mere shadow of a once great Lucia. Stick to the recordings."
1,Just a pretty voice like a million others....,"Sutherland was in her time a very famous soprano, and arguably still is. And that just boggles my mind. I'm sorry, but to me, she is nothing but a canary...and not a very good one either. If you think sutherland is magnificent and can think of nothing better, boy, are you missing out on the beauty and splendor of opera. Once upon a time there were ""singing-actresses"" - sopranos who knew opera was more than just a pretty voice - Callas was one of them. Compared to Callas' dramaticism and incredible ability to convey every heart-felt emotion, Sutherland sounds like someone reading off a grocery list. Ask yourself this - is opera ONLY about hitting the high notes? Take my advice, listen to callas, and you'll never be the same again."
2,Alfredo Kraus saves the performance,"Lucia di Lammermoor is a bel canto masterpiece that requires both vocal agility and a good sense of dramatic skill. By the time this DVD was recorded, Dame Joan no longer had the beautiful high notes she once possessed. Her voice is now droopy, her Italian slurred by some strange force of nature. In other words, her Lucia is a maddening disaster. Callas and Sills and Moffo at least brought some justice to the role, and throughout their career, the good Lucias were preserved on record. Sutherland was a vocally good Lucia, but she lacked drama, an essential component to the bel canto school of singing. Thank goodness Alfredo Kraus was there to save the performance.And for the demented Callas basher, don't bring your [...] around here. Callas' genius does not deserve to be insulted by the despondent pool of dumbness [...] that you come from. She can sing Lucia around dame Joan and you know it."
4,The Best Lucia Available on Video.,"Agree that Joan's voice was beginning to show wear in this performance (I have the tape and LD) but it has a good cast supporting her and she is still worth the price of the video! The costumes and production at The Met are just fine as well. She is not my favorite Lucia, however, Ruth Ann Swenson is even better that Joan but you can't get her Lucia on video. Recommended as a memory of Joan in one of her most famous roles if for no other reason. But it stands as a credible Lucia. Recommended as a truly beautiful opera with great music!"
3,Cinematic Hodgepodge,"W.C. Fields' ""You Can't Cheat An Honest Man"" (1939) is a rather schizophrenic affair. As Larson E. Whipsnade, Fields remains his old inimitable self - whether playing high-society ping pong or getting hosed by a circus elephant. However, when he is off-screen for long stretches, the film becomes an Edgar Bergen-Charlie McCarthy vehicle and drags terribly. Though the Fields-McCarthy radio ""feuds"" have become classics, they do not translate as well in cinematic form. With the exception of a brief reunion in ""Song of the Open Road"" (1944), it's easy to see why there never was a Fields-Bergen encore on the big screen. ""You Can't Cheat An Honest Man"" has its moments of hilarity, but a little more Fields would have helped."
5,"Clever, Quick, and Funny!","This is definatly W.C. Fields at his finest. While the plot maybe is not so great, all of the comedians bring this light hearted comedy to the highest expectations. Charlie McCarthy and Edgar Bergen are at their mischevious, cleverest best. Recommended for anyone who loves old comedies."
5,Great Fields Classic,"I remembered this movie but had not seen it for years. W.C. Fields at his best. Edgar Bergen and Charlie, the perfect foils."
5,Easy-to-use overview of International Trade Theory,"I used this book in my international trade class and the it really helped me do well in the class. My professor was really confusing, but the book's discussion and examples made the concepts easy to understand. Overall, from a student's perspective, I would definitely recommend the book."
1,Not the best presentation of International Trade,This book is horrible. As a student of Professor Wong's I used this book extrensively. The mathematical examples were too general and presented in a confusing manner. The lack of intution behind the examples made his examples even more confusing
