1,missing parts,The item came with missing parts. The company then tried to make me go thru hoops to discourage me from getting the missing parts.They finally told me the part was back ordered and told me they would send it.Four weeks later and I have nothing and by the way Amazon said it was not their problem.I will never purchase on Amazon again.
3,Harder to use than Garmin,"I had a Garmin C330 stolen so I bought this one. Harder to use, maps are not up to date. Highlight of use - I am heading to a restaurant, driving 60 mph in the middle of the freeway when i hear the ""YOU HAVE ARRIVED"" noise...That's when I realized that I made a subpar choice."
4,MAGELLEN ROADMATE 2000,"Ok wow bad reviews!!!. I have used this unit for 6 months in 6 states. I love it. It has been correct most all of the time. I found the highway exit information a little out of date. It might list only some of the gas stations and restaurants even still it provided useful information. i work in field service and use this device to find my customers. I would say it locates them 99% of the time. The database seems as accurate as mapquest. If mapquest doesnt show it the GPS probably wont either. I thought the maps were upgradeable, now im a bit scared about doing that after reading these posts. For $199 i think its a great deal."
2,GPS for dummies,"It's a pretty basic GPS unit. The menus are few and easy and the touch screen is nice. The voice is not annoying. However, I wish it would give more choices when selecting a POI. If I choose ""McDonalds"", there may be five in town and I would like to be able to select which McDonalds I want to go to, rather than it selecting it for me.My biggest gripe is the AC adapter that shipped with my unit does not work - it must be powered from the car adapter. I would suggest setting the 'auto power off' to something other than the default 'never'. Otherwise the unit will drain itself while ""sleeping"" until you get it plugged in again."
2,Works great...while it's alive,"I've had this product since Dec. 2006 (paid $225 for it at the time). It has worked great: got me where I needed to go, provided me with the nearest Taco Bells, suggested alternate routes when it detects that I'm stuck in traffic, and etc.However, it only comes with a one year warranty. Low and behold, after 14 months of service (not much since I don't drive everyday and only use it for the occasional trip), it decided to die on me this month. I can send it back to Magellan for repair but that'll cost more than a new GPS. I don't think I'll go Magellan again."
3,Magellan RoadMate 2000,"Good overall, but it needs to have the more current street info. Roads built 3 years ago don't show up. Occationally makes you drive in a longer route when picking the shortest time route. Also, Points of interest needs to be better refined, if you choose POI info around exit it can give info 70 miles away (not too helpful). However, I have learned to rely on it. It always seems to get you at your desired destination."
1,Stay away,purchased this GPS and had to return it just one week later because it would freeze up and would also just start to reset itself over and over.received a new one and a just over a month later after doing the magellan update for this system i lost all audio functions. called customer support (which is a joke in itself) and was told that my issue was being sent up to another tier af service and i would receive a call within an hour. no call and it is now going on 7 hours....something tells me i wont be geting a call back.plan on calling corporate to complain becasue i do not want this unit and would not recommend it to anyone.
1,Buy another,"I've had the Magellan Roadmate 2000 for about 3 years. As far as working its not bad. It takes getting used to and sometimes it routes me ways I know are wrong. If your returning from a route you just had in the unit. It sometimes takes you in a completely different way home. The thing that galls me the most is I've waited for a map update for the last two years. Now that they have one they want 79.00 plus shipping to ship me a CD to update. I don't expect free updates forever, but give me one! I can buy a refurbished Magellan 2000 or a tom tom for the same money as the update.I will not buy another magellan product period."
1,Bad Product,"It hardly works for it always freezes, always give wrong directions, and has very bad support, to make a long story short."
3,Magellan RoadMate 2000 Vehicle Navigation System,This product is great. It is easy to use and very helpful. Purchased it for my wife and she loves it.
3,The Good and Bad,"The good news, the Magellan RoadMate 2000 is an excellent, inexpensive GPS that is very intuitive to use.The bad news, I am at least the second person to report major problems that developed after using the Magellan RoadMate 2000 for a couple of days. The GPS works, the computer will calculate routes but it keeps saying ""Proceed to Route"" and give no visual or vocal guidance.Since I knew this going in it was the reason I purchased it at Amazon instead of BuyDig or Beach Photo where the price is less and I don't have to pay WA sales tax. I can just imagine trying to return this thing to one of them. As one of the previous reviewers mentioned, Magellan has outsourced the tech support to somewhere where they speak marginal English and are totally worthless.When it was working, I really liked - hopefully I won't have problems with the replacement."
1,Worthless Unit,"I went with this unit based on the Magellan name but have been very disappointed. The Magellan name doesn't mean what I tought it did. It worked fine for a week, then became very sporadic at holding a signal. Tech support had me ship the unit back for repair, and it was returned two weeks later with the same problem. That led to more calls to tech support with long waits on hold only to be told I had to ship the unit back again for repair. I'm hold again now as I write this. Bottom line is that I've owned this unit for nearly two months and have gotten maybe 8 hours of use out it. Save your money. Buy another brand. Or just get a map."
5,Great book!,Very useful indepth explanation of TCP/IP and how it works with Windows 2000. Chapter on TCP/IP implementation details explains how it has been implemented on Windows 2000 and I like the protocol traces. Lots of info on TCP/IP registry parameters.
2,"Many functions in examples missing in Matlab R12, R13","This would be a great book except it needs to be updated for Matlab R12 and (now) R13. Many of the functions referenced in the book (e.g. zplot, freqz) have now in the signal processing toolkit so one really needs to acquire this toolkit to make the book fully useful."
4,ANOTHER BARRY SADLER EPIC!,This should be all made into movies. Highlander stole the idea but it doesn't come near to this work of extrodinarry talent that Mr. Sadler had. This is a must read.
3,Return of Daimajin,Return of Daimajin is the third film of the Daimajin trilogy. Not as good as the first two films but still very entertaining and beautifully photographed.
1,"Sorry, No coments","Sorry, but you send me the wrong shippment. Then I had to return the material I still do not know if you credit to my account. Please if you were not do it, please take care of this.I will appreciate.Best RegardsCesar Canaval"
2,Only holds 2 cymbsls,"The previous reviewer gives incorrect info, this bag only hold 2 cymbals. The dividers don't exist. Quite a waste of money. I will return this."
2,Misleading title,"When I bought the DVD ""Precision Abs"" I thought the workout would concentrate on excercises for the abdominal muscles. However most of the time is spent with ballet- and pilates-like stretching (mostly for the legs) and some posture and breathing exercises which have only marginal effects on the abdominal muscles.It is probably OK if you want to improve flexibility and posture, but not if you need some concentrated abs workout.After trying some videos, I think the thing to do is get a good book on abdominal exercises, learn the proven routines, get some weights and resitance bands and do the boring reps each day with increasing resistance and number of repititions.Sigh."
3,"red and yellow black and white, we are precious in HIS sight","I enjoyed this book. All pentecostals are not the same, though."
5,About World War 2 in Palestine/Israel,It is a touching film of how Israelis were being drafted for the war. People trying to rebuild their lives.
2,A Forgettable Film,"A coming-of-age story set in pre-Israel Palestine,The House on Chelouche Street was nominated for the best foreign film in 1973. The focus is on a boy of 15, Sami, who is forced to take work in a machine shop to help support his widowed mother and siblings. The movie follows his transformation from child to man, set against the backdrop of the political violence of the time. The translation is very poorly done, and only some of the dialogue is translated. The white print is sloppily set up against white screens, making it very difficult to read. One gets a sense of the film through watching the actors, not from the dialogue. The movie is not bad, but there are much better movies around in this genre and from this culture."
4,Great Take On Jewish Mothers,"I'm a Jewish man, and for me the best part of this movie was the lead character's (a 15 year old boy) relationship with his mother. It's the best depiction of the way Jewish mothers treat their sons that I've ever seen. Somehow, it came to be, that the predominant depiction of Jewish mothers is that they are over-involved, over-caring, and very emotional. But that's not how it really is. The mother in this movie is how it is. She's self-centered and fairly cold. She expects, as a matter of course, that her 15 year old son should drop out of school to support her and her family. ""A son should take care of a mother and not the other way around!"" she screams. That's how most Jewish mothers REALLY think. They think males - of all ages - are there to support them. It's why (for the most part) Jewish males grow up to be very responsible husbands and fathers. But it's also why (for the most part) we don't really like our mothers. This movie nails it on the head."
5,Spectacular.,"I am the kind of person who can't really like a movie if I can't understand it, or the plot is rife with holes. I did not have that problem with this book. Chapman's lyrical, beautiful writing carried me through this tale of three lost souls, and I loved the book because of it. This is the kind of book you want to reread the minute you finish, so you can understand it more, and experience its characters again. This is one of my favorites."
2,ICKY POO,"I read this book because it sounded funny and it got a lot of good reviews. I have read Lyndsay Sands before and I'm not that crazy about her books but thought I'd give it another chance. There were some funny moments but not as funny as I was expecting. The characters were pretty bland and the premise was generic. What got me was how much they went on and on about how much the hero stunk. It was a total turn off. I wouldn't have minded if it was mentioned once at the beginning but it was a big part of the story. I don't like stinky things and I sure don't want to read about stinky men in my romance books. When I thought about how the hero looked, he wasn't attractive to me because of his stench. I read these books for escapism and fantasy. Way to mess with my fantasy!!! I found myself wanting to get to the end of the book so I could start a new one. One that doesn't include stinky people. Oh and to top it all off, no epilogue...grrrr!"
5,What a fun read!,This book will definitely go on my keeper shelf! For those of you who haven't read anything by Ms. Sands(yet) this book--as well as her others--are laugh out loud funny! A heroine who wears a chastity belt? A hero who actually *smells*? What a hoot!
2,"A stinking hero? No, thanks!","Most of this book evolves about a hero who doesn't want to bath (he takes a bath twice a year and stinks like a swine most of the time) and a heroine who is trying to force him to change this habit. It would be all right if the conflict between them was anything else, but such a basic thing like personal hygiene just can't be an issue. It was disgusting. I simply couldn't like the hero no mater how hard I tried due to his aversion to bathing and also due to his horrible accent. Ok, he was a Scott, but still, it would be nice if he would talk a bit more intelligible."
3,A little too basic,Wish there were more in the book about design professionals who consult with other professionals--how to manage your prime? I wish there was a similar book for landscape architect.
2,Brakes very easily,"It did not last a week before I broke into a million pieces, way too many to repair, give it a try"
5,Who doesn't LOVE Mozart?,"I've always loved classical music, and listening to Mozart literally is my ""Calgon take me away"" moment. And, if I listen to this music while driving I find I don't speed as much as with pop music. So win win all around :-)"
5,Westek Under Cabinet Lighting,"Does the job ... lots of light when switched to high. Mounting directions did not make sense had to ""wing it"" but in the end - happy with item."
2,Nice but cheap,"When my mother custom built her kitchen 45 years ago she put in lovely under cabinet lighting...it's still there. She has only replaced bulbs. We put in a series of Westek 16"" under cabinet lighting fixtures 7 years ago. They burned out earlier this year. They are hard wired into our electrical system. Such a disappointment. I have to replace the whole thing. I unfortunately bought a bunch of bulbs thinking that was the problem. Don't buy these with the idea of longevity."
4,Works with Linux,"I have had this card working with Mandriva, Centos, and Windows XP. It needs madwifi for Linux. I have had no trouble. I only gave it a 4 because I couldn't find any native Linux drivers. It works with x86_64 and i386."
2,Disappointed,"I ordered this steamer only to never have the chance to use it. Upon the initial washing in the dishwasher (top rack) the lid cracked. I did this before ever having the chance to use it to steam food. Perhaps there was a warning against cleaning the unit in the dishwasher but I didn't see anything. The bottom of the steamer had a max temperature rating for 400 degrees Fahrenheit so I'm doubting that was the case. Perhaps it is a great steamer and I just received a defective unit? Either way, I don't like to waste money and I will not be purchasing another."
1,Poor quality product.,Most reviewers of this item are talking about the benefits of steaming which i agree is great but this steamer is not good. After the tupperware steamer I had for years got damaged in the dishwasher I bought this hoping it will last atleast half as long. Only after a few weeks of using it the steamer looks dull and dingy. The transparent lid is turning yellow. The plate provided to keep the vegetables inside the steamer looks slightly twisted and dull. All this after good care during washing and also I used it only a few times for light steaming less than 5 minutes. I am ready to throw it and buy a tupperware steamer again. By the way the tupperware steamer lasted for nearly 4 years for me and would have lasted more if it did not fall off the top of the dishwasher rack and got burnt by a coil in the bottom of the dishwasher.Do not buy this item the quality is very bad.
1,steamer broke!,"I bought this steamer for my daughter and when she used it the first time, it worked great, but afterwards she noticed a large crack going all the way across the bottom of it and she had to throw it away.Update 12-27-09..I bought one for my son also and while he was visiting on Christmas day I asked him how he liked his steamer and he said that his was cracked also and wasn't able to use it. I'm so disappointed that these were poor quality and my kids didn't get to use them."
3,Works but fragile,"I had to order the item twice because the bottom pan arrived cracked twice. It is still fragile, and even snapping on the top plastic lid caused a piece of plastic to chip off. No place on the steamer or on the packaging does it indicate whether it is dishwasher safe; a strange omission. The steamer tray does not sit squarely on the bottom of the pan by design (why?). However, it does work as advertised. I will continue to use it until it falls apart then wait for a sturdier replacement. It's a shame because it is a good idea. For a few more dollars one might come up with a sturdier product."
2,Poor Quality,"I had one of these for years. It is the perfect size for fish, asparagus, and many other dishes for the microwave. Then I managed to break it, so I ordered another one in March of this year. Like a couple of others, my new one developed a crack and broke after only a couple of uses. I'll try another brand the next time."
5,Cooking 4/2 hot item,"The Nordic Micro Steamer is a fish lovers dream. This product produces a moist flaky texture to your Salmon, Sea Bass, excellent for Cod. Saves time, easy cleanup, and gives beautiful taste to fish. Two Salmon filets cook up in no time. You can add lemon juice to the small about of water and it enhance the taste experience. Good product for people who are busy and have a limited amount of time to prepare fresh healthy foods."
5,Bellydance! Slow Moves,I so enjoyed this DVD. The instruction was clear and easy to follow. I found that I could do all of the movements as they were instructed right away! The workout is gentle. The costumes are beautiful. I cant wait to move on to Bellydance! Fast Moves.
5,good too,"you can not beat the low price for 3 of them. Better than I expected. good quality and soft, without any glue smell. I bought 4 bands here just for future change."
3,Decent bang for the buck,"This is a good pan for the price. Pros: deep, large capacity, solid manufacturing. Cons: balance is marginal--if you're not cooking with gas, you may find that the pan does not sit flat on the burner."
3,"White Sox Fans, Go Crazy","""Tales from the White Sox Dugout"" is not exactly ""Ball Four."" Then again, if it had been ""Ball Four,"" you'd surely have known that by now, long before reading THIS review! ""Kitty's"" baseball memoirs are not sensationalistic; they're fairly well, but not particularly well, written; the book doesn't have color pictures. What it does have are enjoyable anecdotes by a great slugger, and decent man, about teams that only a South Side Chicagoan could still love -- the 1980s White Sox. I'm a White Sox junkie (yes, there are a few) and so, I'm very easy to please. If you buy this little ditty of a book, you'll have no regrets. No Pulitzer, but no problem."
3,"Covers basics - SAME title as ""Fire Eating: A Manual of Instruction""","This book does cover the basic ideas of fire eating. Even though I have not eaten fire the info looks very good. Just be aware that it is very brief and terse.Also be aware that this is the EXACT same book as ""Fire Eating: A Manual of Instruction"" with ISBN of 0917643127, so order either one or the other, not both."
1,Don't bother.,"I bought this book as a novelty, a gift. First of all, the book is the size of a Reader's Digest, but with only 20 pages...so why did I need to pay $5 in shipping for something that could have used two postage stamps? Ahhh, ""handling"".... don't waste your money. It won't make a good coffee table book."
5,Great Gift for a teenager you love,"This book has just about every question you can image asking yourself. I am 20 now and I got this book maybe 4 years ago. I filled up every line and space. It would make a great gift for a teenager, but would probably be more appreciated by the teenage girl in your life. Very helpful for bad days...good days...dream jotting. Well worth the money!"
3,Product just ok,"This product has a great design, but the quality of sound is just ok. If the manufacturer improved the sound quality, this product would be fantastic."
4,Well..,"I don't think his lyrics tot his song were as deep as his other lyrics--this is quite a change fromt he Gackt I've come to love and adore--but still, it's got a catchy tune!"
3,simplistic humor,"The movie is so simplistic in it's story that it makes it kinda funny to see ,but the location is filmed is beautiful"
3,different from the picture,"The picture shows a case for 6 knives, I should have read more carefully as this is only a small case for one. Saw the 6 ("") and read it as storage for 6 knives, as pictured, when skimming the details. This case is pretty well made, black faux leather with a soft interior and zipper opening, only the one pocket inside so you can fit one knife only. Nice gold spiderco logo on the outside without text. The padding is very soft. I took off one star for misleading picture and another for high price considering it is a simple case with fake leather, nothing too special. Would be a solid 4 stars if priced around $10, and 5 stars with real leather and a better zipper at this price ($18).Edit: picture has been updated."
3,Seems a little...cheap,"If you have a spyderco w/o a box that needs protecting this makes sense, but it's just a cheap feeling black pouch.The ""mock leather"" is plastic, there is no rigidity (it's all just padding and fabric) and the gold spyder seems like it might flake or rub off over time...it's just thin paint.So I mean, it is what it claims to be and it is something to put your knife in so I can't rate it too low...but it's just not what I would expect given the brand and the price."
4,ALA in general help me stay lean,I take one twice a day with meal after AM workout then the other before PM workout. This has no after taste & easy to swallow. I've increased my cardio time with ALA & for some reason it has decreased my craving for carbs...but then I take other supplements to enhance my workouts in combination w clean eating.
5,A Wonderful Gift To Anyone Struggling On Their Path,"On the surface this book appears to be an oxymoron. How can someone define a set of beliefs with any depth while also including the breadth of elements from almost every variation of the theme?The author sets to putting into well-written words the desire of many in the emerging church to draw the best from a wide variety of traditions and streams within Christianity, while still remaining orthodox. McLaren's vision and challenge is to see the Christian faith as something that is both broad and deep that calls us to highest standard of every dimension of ones faith.If you are struggling as a Christian this is a valuable resource for you to have. It displays Christian's adherence is to God, and not to ideologies. It is both easy and enjoyable to read, and the renewed sense of faith it instills is refreshing."
1,A Generous Waste of Time,This book is a generous + bountiful + post/modern + relativist/skeptical + bombastic/rhetorical + unlearned + experiential/lumpish + groundless/unnecessary + regurgitated/mediocre + uncongenial + exclusivistic + immature + disembodied + ad hominem-yet-irrelevant + languishing + terminal waste of time.
1,Agenerous Agnosticism,"Confused concepts = confusing conclusions. A little bit of everything is a whole bunch of nuthin'. Hodgepodge of unholy hash. By pouring his own unclear internal definitions into crucial Christian words, while being deliberately vague about precise usage (I mean this and not that vs. whatever you feel I mean), readers are misled about just what lexicon he's using. It makes one wonder just what Christ he has in mind? Something that he has come to his own terms with? Or Jesus of Nazareth now at God's Right Hand Who can only be taken on His terms and no others?"
1,why not?,"why not be a buddhist? why not view the book of mormon in equality with the Bible? why makes Jesus much different than other religious leaders? where do you draw the line to where you talk about jesus a lot, but are simply like bahai or universalist? we can move so far along and be ""generous"" that we aren't really Christian anymore."
1,"Old heresy, new clothes","There is nothing new under the sun. I have nothing more to add than what has already been discussed, except to beg people to be discerning."
1,Syncretism a la Mode,"An attempt at promulgating a new hybrid strain of systematic theology that systematically whittles the Bible into slivers of faiths a la mode. Reminds me a lot of the ""Jefferson Bible"" which scissors out all the unpalatable parts of the New Testament that don't fit the preconceived humanist philosophy of the alterer. Cut and Paste is the way many enjoy their religious credos. Starbucks-spirituality ordered to taste: latte, mocha, half-caf, blend, specialty roast, espresso, lo-cal, whipped cream, extra-dark-or-lite grind, consumer-catered.Coffee is good, but if it loses its distinctiveness and migrates farther from the original beans+water intent and purpose evolving to syrup or milkshake, how can it be made coffee again once it's convoluted or diluted?If you like the ""Jefferson Bible"" approach to your faith in Jesus or the ""starbucking"" of your worship of the Lord God then this book is the latest recipe on the religion market for you."
3,"Label Maker, Label Breaker","The chief value of this book lies in its challenge to examine the multitude of labels that define and/or divide Christians. For a list making, graph drawing, compulsive writing, multi-tradition-bridging pastor like me, many of the ideas felt familiar, and some were expressed in particularly pithy ways. The book also contains a helpful forward by John Franke about a post-foundationalist approach to theology."
1,Not for the fundamental christian reader...,"Brian McLaren is a post-modern christian according to this book. He urges us to accept anything and everything ever associated with protestantism/christianity. He devalues the death of Christ in the name of ""we can't know everything"" even though the entire Bible circles entirely around the cross of Jesus. I was very disappointed with this author."
2,Neo-liberalism,"After reading this book, it just seems to me to be re-packaged liberalism that I have seen presented by the likes of Spong."
1,fails the course,"I taught seminary and graduate students theology and a little philosophy for twenty years. When I started reading this book, I immediately felt that I was reading a paper by a student who did not want to bother with doing his homework or research. instead he would try bluffing and bragging to get through his assignment. In this case the student fails the course.P.S. I'm not Debbie Duncan. I have no idea how that name got on this review."
4,thought provoking,"Most books on the emergent church phenomenon have tended to focus on technology, worship style and throwing rocks at traditionalists. I found McLaren to be balanced and thoughtful. I also found it interesting to try to conceive of an ""emergent"" theology.While I often disagreed with particular parts of McLarens theology, I found the total product to be fascinating. I found myself questioning my assumptons again, and as I worked through my questions I felt myself growing spiritually.strongly encourage you to read this"
1,Don't bother.,"I had to struggle through this book, and at the end found myself wanting to get rid of it immediately. McLaren advances the idea that Jesus is not necessary for salvation - but that salvation can be achieved through any spiritual path. There are too many points to mention here which are not only incorrect from a Christian standpoint, but which are also illogical. Worse than that, McLaren's rambling pseudo-scholarly style verges on annoying - his disclaimers become tiresome after the first page."
5,A Great Book,"In this book Brian McLaren takes you on a virtual tour of modern Christianity. He celebrates the positive elements of faith and practice that have emerged from these Christian traditions, and he rejoices in the notion that the emerging church can feast on it all. At the heart of what McLaren has writen is a desire for Christians and the Christian Church to do a better job of following Jesus. He draws a clear distinction between being a Christian and a Christ follower. He sees humility as the key to following Jesus and to sharing in all that our Christian traditions have to provide. It is, in my opinion, the best book Brian has writen. I highly recomend it to all pastors, Christians, and spiritual seekers."
2,Ungenerous Hypocrisy,"McLaren takes aim mostly at the Evangelical culture and Lord knows we need to get smacked down, but what he fails to understand is how dogmatic, prideful and just plain wrong his spiritually enlightened comrades are on many counts. Case in point is his fawning over environmentalists while he takes hypocritical fundamentalists to task for using scare tactics. I've worked on an environmental issue for four years and daily witness unbelievable slander and misinformation being spread by the leading green groups who use junk science and emotion to lie. This is precisely what McLaren accuses overzealous evangelicals of doing and of course there's some truth to that charge. But the fact that he self righteously hails his environmentalist friends as noble and heroic exposes the weakness of this book, and McLaren's lack of credibility in general."
1,Corresponds to modern times rather than responds to it,"Deeply embedded and wedded to the spirit of the contempo culture and angst of the age. So convergent with PoMo that it is emergent from within it as a natural outgrowth, as limestone stalactites dripping from the ceiling in a dark cavern.What the cavern of PoMo needs is not more limestone, soda and water this book drips, but the LIGHT of the GOSPEL of SINFORGIVENESS by CHRIST'S CROSS, BURIAL, RISING.Friend, please pass the torch of the Lamb so the blind can see their way out of the deepening dark. Let Hebrews and 1 John enlighten your safe passage.POST-LIBERAL PRE-PAGANISM IN PSEUDO-christianese CLOAKING."
1,another relative christian book,I found the book to be relative to the person more then seeking a historical church founded by Jesus ever hear of the Orthodox Church if you haven't you are in need of the biggest treasure in America
5,FINALLY!!!!,"I've waited a long time for a male crooner that could sing like Buble' and also write classic flavored original songs. I have found that in Tony DeSare. The truth is, Tony does not have a whole lot of competition in the young male crooner department. We've got Buble' on the top of the heap followed by Peter Cincotti, Jamie Cullum and Matt Dusk. Buble' and Cincotti only put out a new studio CD every 2 years and that leaves a big void. The appearance of Tony on the scene fills in the gap. The combination of smooth vocals and wonderfully crafted songs give DeSare the edge and his songs are only getting better. He also handles the great american songbook with style and originality. Top covers are ""There Will Never Be Another You"" , ""You'd Be So Nice to Come Home To"" and ""Oh Look At Me Now."" Top originals are ""Let's Just Stay In"", and ""I'll Never Have Another You."" All of us music lovers out there really need to support this guy. We need more of this type of singer and music on the market."
5,Amazing!!!,"This is probably the best jazz album I have ever heard. Tony DeSare's sophomore release delivers on all levels. There are some original songs here along with some remakes and they are all phenomenal! The title song doesn't disappoint, it's a beautiful ballad that will surely become a classic. I would definitely recommend this album to anyone. If you're not a jazz fan, after listening to this album, you will definitely become one."
2,Disappointed,"I heard Tony Desare when he was introduced by another performer at a concert at the Meyerhoff in Baltimore.He was quite good but the album just didn't appeal to me. Sorry, Tony!"
2,Not my favorite DeSare album,"I own all 3 of Tony DeSare's cds, and this is my least favorite. It contains fewer standards and more original material (written by DeSare) than his other two albums.This album seems to establish one mood and style, and rarely deviates from it. The slow, sultry jazz feel established with the opening song, Prince's ""Kiss"" dominates a large part of the album.This might be a nice album to listen to as you cuddle up by the fire at home, or as background music during a dinner party or at a coffee house, but is a little boring to listen to during a long commute in the car. I think this is due to the lack of variety of styles which are present in both of his other cds, ""Radio Show"", and ""Want You"".As a matter of personal preference, I would purchase either of those before I would purchase this one. ""Want You"" is my particular favorite."
1,Don't do it!!!,"I purchased this frame as a gift for a friend of mine. When I saw it on her desk and noticed the terrible quality of the images, I was embarassed that I had given such an inferior item as a gift. Perhaps the images she had loaded were quite low resolution, but the pictures looked terrible with huge pixels.I would not recommend this item at all."
1,2 is not a charm,Ordered two frames from the third party source. Neither on of them worked at all. It has been a nightmare trying to return them for a refund.
5,Quality Cookware at Bargain Price,"This is an exceptional value for a set of everyday cookware, you cannot beat the price. The pans are sturdy with vented glass lids, the mixing bowl set is nice and the utensils withholder are an added bonus. Some of the utensils aren't very practical but considering the value of the pots and bowls, even if you don't use most of the utensils (the ladle is too shallow)you can't go wrong with this set."
4,Good value,"First off, I don't claim to be a world class chef, but assomeone who does a lot of cooking I found this set to be avery good value. Everything arrived in good shape, and I'vebeen using the pots and pans for a month now and they stilllook and work fine. I especially like the glass lids for thepots."
3,Not for daily usage,"To start it off, you can't beat the price, $34 shipped through Gold Box offer is pretty good.I'm kind of surpised how it was shipped. There is no fancy packaging. They are tightly arranged in a regular brown shipping box, no company logo or anything like that. I guess they save a lot of money that way, but they did arrive undented in my case.The quality and durability is probably 4 out of 10. It's a bit rough and thin. It's probably not going to last years like other top of the line stainless cookwares. However, if you don't cook regularly, I guess you can get by with this set. Like others have said, the utensils have to be the worst items in this set, it seems you can bent it just by using it.Anyway, you get what you pay for. If you LOVE to cook, don't get this set!"
1,Changed review: terrible product,"I initially had given this set a ""good value for the money"" review, but I have gone to the trouble of returning to Amazon's site to sharply revise my comments. This set is terrible and I have suggested directly to Amazon that they no longer carry it. The ""stainless"" steel pots are discolored after only a few uses (and I take good care of my Calphalon pots and Henckels knife, so the fault isn't mine). The bowls are so flimsy they bend in your hands. Even at this cheap price, I highly recommend you look elsewhere for a starter set of pots and pans."
4,A must for students of Classical Japanese!,"This reference manual is a concise, yet thorough overview of the Japanese language of the classical era. As stated in the preface, its mere aim is to ""bring together useful materials from Japanese reference works in a form convenient for Western students using the classical language."" And so it does, with many references from the more well known writings, such as Genji Monogatari, Makura no sooshi, and Man'yooshuu, among others. The manual is carefully divided into various sections, based on grammatical function; vocabulary items are then introduced, with its various semantic values and its Modern Japanese cognate, or equivalent. Subsequently, examples are taken from a piece of classical literature to illustrate the particular vocabulary item's function--this method helps to maintain a high level of retention. Overall, this is a wonderful little book that is a lot more valuable than it actually costs...it is an investment that is priceless!"
5,Good Job.,"I had no problems with anything. Thank you very much, can't wait till i get the second one. It is an awesome show!!!"
3,"Worth watching, but not fantastic.","I, for one, can't understand why this show gets so many 5 stars. It, in no way, deserves such an honor that shows such as Cowboy Bebop and Clannad do. Don't get me wrong. It's a perfectly ok, middle of the road show more deserving of 3 stars. Decent pick for a first watching. Don't know if I'll watch it again, though."
5,insanely awesome series,"Huge anime fan and this series is great. The story line is fantastic. Definitely hoping for a 3rd season. If you like fighting, awesome effects, great graphics, and funny side stories this is the perfect anime."
4,"Decent, with some quirks...","First of all the story is good. It has some great characters to back it too. In some ways, it steps outside the groove of regular harem romance plots. Season one is probably the better of the two seasons. Season two doesn't really expand much and it starts to fall back on traditional harem comedy bits. Its definitely worth a watch. But that doesn't mean its perfect. The art style, takes time to get used to. Women are without a doubt the worst drawn. Bodies are either completely out of proportion or full of odd angles. You can tell it's the artist's style but it is distracting because it takes away from the characters. It is a shame because the rest of the series is drawn well but when it comes to women its like they are very amateurish. But thats likely the only downside you might find in this. Enjoy it, its a fun series once you get past that."
2,A short review.,Sekirei is about as cookie cutter as anime come (and that's saying ALOT). I watched the first season and have to say it will be entertaining if you are looking for style and pantie shots above any sort of substance. Every step along the story's plot can easily be predicted.
4,"Great book--Exposure to grammar, not mastery is key","I just recieved this book in the mail the other day and after thumbing through it a little while, I've decided I really like it. Now, I did find a poem or two where the wording is not the original, hence the 4 star rating. I didn't find this issue problematic, I just looked up the original poem online, printed it out and stuck it in my book. Doing this allowed me the oppotunity to find out some extra information on the actual poet, which was helpful, and I plan on sharing that information with my child.I love how the author (Jesse Wise) states that we tend to underestimate what our young children are capable learning. This book is all about exposing the child to grammar, mastery is not expected at this level. I'm excited to get started with this book. It's simply done, and seems very easy going, not a stressful grammar program at all. Which makes it really fun for both parent and child."
3,Okay if you don't have anything else,"We've used this book while waiting for another curriculum to arrive. It is okay, my son has learned nouns, common nouns, and proper nouns. We do 5 or 6 lessons at a time because they go so quickly. A little boring and very repetitive (which can be good and bad), but I'm not raving about it."
4,Good for adults and kids!,I am on lesson 5 and have found it easy and enjoyable to my child as well as me. We were lacking in the phonics/English area and this is a GREAT fill in! Lessons are easy!
2,Not what I expected,"When you think of a language book for first graders, you usually think of something brightly colored with very simple concepts and explanations. The 'First Language Lessons' was not only all black and white on the inside, but it jumped right in with concepts harder than I would have thought you'd begin with. While I loved 'A Well Trained Mind',I have been gravely dissapointed by all the companion books by Susan Bauer."
2,Boring boring boring,"I guess if you have no idea how to teach your kids language (if you're homeschooling), and you need a lot of structure, this is the book for you. I found it about as dry as a dictionary."
5,First Language Lessons,Excellent! Easy to use and very through. Self paced for any learning ability. Covers everything plus more for national standardized test.
1,Horrible book....,"I'm not a fan of books that tell the instructor exactly what to say and leave little or no room for instruction to be geared towards a student's abilities, but even if I was I would hate this book. The poem/reading selections are lacking, and they overkill on repetition without introducing new concepts in a timely manner. After 5-6 lessons the author has introduced the concept of a noun as well as common and proper nouns. Then she continues to repeat this information for the next 40 lessons before pronouns are introduced."
3,"Complete, yet dry","We started with this book to lay the foundation for language arts, and gave up after two weeks. Our girls hated it, because it was so boring and tedious. After each question is the oral response the child is to give, and our kids just don't learn like this. It reminded me of the old fashioned one room school room approach, were the children in each grade had to memorize their lessons and recite them back to their teacher. They may be able to spout out the correct response, but may not have a clue what they just ""learned"".I loved the idea of this book, being simple and concise. But ultimately we moved on to Latin, after understanding the reality of english grammer from 'The Latin Centered Curriculum' website. Now my daughter loves Latin and English and has easily learned and retained the grammar she learned from it."
3,"Not a new edition, a reissue","A point of clarification. This December 1988 reissue is not an updated version as a previous reviewer suggested. I bought it thinking it was an update, but it is not. It is only a reissue of the 1965 version. I am returning it."
3,"a harmless book, but if a child doesn't know these things by the time she/he reaches 7 or 8, its the parents who need help","This is an adorable book about a life style that use to be common among the upper middle classes. Nothing offensive here. However, if a child does not know how to eat, or to be considerate of his/her peers and respectful towards adults by the time he/she is 7 years old, its the parents who need this book, not the children.Manners are taught by example, always."
5,White Gloves and Party Mannners,"I have given all five granddaughters this book. I think that it is an excellent book for young children to learn proper manners. I also inscribed the words that Gigi's Aunt told her about table manners (from the movie Gigi).Both of my sons received ""Stand Up, Shake Hands,Say How Do You Do."""
3,ok set,"The splatter cover is alot shallower than I expected, it would not cover my big bowls completely.Maybe I just have bad luck, the set I received come quite dirty, many pieces have scratches on them already. The popcorn bowl has big and small cracks all over. But since I don't eat popcorn it's a piece I don't need, so I didn't bother to get a replacement. Did try to call the manufacturers though, but I guess they are a east coast company, no one answered the phone during my off-work hours.The eggs sticks on the poacher, make sure to coat it with some oil."
3,not a novel not written by a scholar either,"As both a practicing lawyer(15+years) a practicing Doc. for 26 + years and a libertarian since 1980, I immediately ordered this book when I heard about it through some fully informed jury assoc. materials I had received.I was not impressed with it! It is not a work of scholarship, not well documented and mainly a list of the authors opinions. I did not learn anything about the jury system that I did not already know, even the Greek Mythology part. I plan to run for judge in 04 and would have liked to be able to recommend this book to potential voters, but I am not going to be able to after reading it!I rated it as high as I did because the author made some important points. Also, I hate having people giving low reviews to my book!"
4,Accessible de Sade,"this book is accessible for those who find Sade's more famous stuff too difficult. Philosophy in the Bedroom, and Justine... it's hard to get past the turds & embuggery. Once you let your mind see what's actually going on, and read & re-read, Sade's ideas may become clearer.OR! in Misfortunes of Virtue, Sade's ideas are bite-sized and closer to the surface. No, it's not as risque and nauseatingly detailed, but it is so much easier to see, ""AHHH! so that's what Sade wants to me get.""The story Windbags of Providence is hilarious. Mildly risque, but he's making commentary about religion, government oficials, and the artist as the artist relates to society.This stuff is in the gigantic book, Philosphy in the Bedroom, but it's so much harder to find it.This book is worth having, definitely."
3,Interesting read on a part of history,"First let me say that I'm not a sadist, but I have become interested in the period in history, specifically French 17th and 18th century, in which ""Libertines"" walked, and social practice and behavior was highly questionable. I think the book ""Perfume"" really opened up my head as to my interest, and I've always been interested in aberrant behaviors. The Marquis de Sade was a man highly speculated, and seldom understood. His thoughts and views were outlandish for the times, and reading this has really made me question how valid so many of the points of some of his writings are. Little did I know when I began this book how often I would find myself re-reading some of the passages, realizing his point on so many things to be so close to accurate that I almost hate to admit it. Anyone who has ever had any interest in what was surely of such scandalous a period should enjoy the perils in the stories of this book."
1,Not Worth the Listening Time,Over the years I have owned numerous symphonic presentations of popular music. The Beatles Symphonic interpretation and presentation is poor at best. The sound is poor - I have heard high school orchestras that do a better job. This one is not worth the money or the time to listen to it.
5,Must have for MTs,An absolute must for the transcriptionist typing operative reports. It's also great for general medical transcription for looking up difficult terms such as a Hryntschak catheter. There are thousands of equipment words including eponyms in an easy-to-look-up format. I have many years' experience in the field and still use it every day.
2,Outdated,This book was wonderful when it first came out but is now sorely outdated and lacking in new terminology. Don't waste your money as many terms you need will be missing.
4,THE UNQUALIFIED DOCTOR'S BEST TREATMENT,It helps in knowing what is hidden in the academics. You need not be a qualified doctor to understand about you.
4,Great entry to Indian indie film,"Good film overall. Strong art direction and well cast delivering solid acting with memorable visuals of Bombay India.Story of Murder and deception. Nasserudin and Kashmira Shah are great. Mystery is kept up till the end.Decent plot twists. A MUST SEE for introduction to early works of the cast. Kashmira Shah's first film. Nasserudin delivers solid quirky performance of the detective.Worth seeing and learning why Indian Indie film is becoming more popular. There are no songs, this is NOT a Bollywood film but murder mystery."
3,"Tea is good, Infuser material is not",The tea I find from this product to be good. However I don't like the #5 plastic infuser that it comes with. It'd be more comfortable with using a stainless steel infuser. Who knows what this plastic releases at higher temperatures?
3,Good except for the nylon infuser,The tea pot works great except the infuser is nylon and discolors after the first usage.
1,Poor value,"I have owned this tea press for a considerable time; I had put it back for a while. I just now began using it again, and I now remember why I had shelved it. It is impossible to pour tea from this pot without spilling it. This is very annoying - annoying to the point that I am finally going to put it out of my misery. Oh, also, I am not pleased with the plastic strainer that has holes way too big. I wish I had my money back....."
1,"Conceptually, Brilliant . . . In Practice, FLAWED","This tea infuser is definitely brilliant, although only in idea. Using it is another matter. First, the fuse basket is poorly designed. I don't think it gives loose tea enough room to fully brew. Second, the basket itself is very flimsy and extremely hard to stay securely in the pot when pouring. As soon as you reach 90 degrees the basket just falls out. You cannot hold onto the lid to keep it in place as you pour because it is very hot. The plunger is made of stainless steel, making it near impossible to leverage.All in all, a horrible product."
5,Prep for The Sessions,"If you plan on seeing The Sessions, seeing Breathing Lessons first is essential. Once you get to know the real Mark O'Brien, seeing John Hawkes portray him is astonishing. Indeed, it gives a finer appreciation for the whole movie."
5,Funny and real,"This is a wonderful documentary because it shows the reality of living independently, but with a fairly complete disability. Mark O'Brien is intelligent, and funny! He sends some very appropriate messages about the challenges of being disabled, the acceptance (by society) of limitations, and the responsibility of both the person and society to allow him and the disabled to live fully, whatever life in which they exist. After all, his brain functions beautifully. I am so glad I watched this, and probably would not have done so if it had not been for the movie, The Sessions."
4,"Wonderful, scenic fun with a great message.","We first purchased the book, ""Momma, Do You Love Me?"" while on a cruise to Alaska, upon which we were accompanied by our little surprise, our 6 week old adopted baby girl. Callie, now 2, has grown to love the book and when I saw the movie I knew she'd love it. She calls it ""Alaska."" It is beautifully animated and has a wonderful two-fold message. (1) No matter what both your parents will always love you, even when you make your parents angry or worried, and (2) Listen to your parents, especially if you want to avoid problems! Callie also loves the song at the end, and sings it to herself long after the video is at an end!"
3,"A long, strange trip","It's hard to tell how much of this book is truth and how much is fiction. However, the author succeeds in creating a very convincing, authentic cultural feel much of the time. The book begins in India, and toward the end it contains too many purple passages from an unpublished novel--everything but the kitchen sink is thrown into this Blob! It's an interesting read, but you may be ready to have it end by the time it ends......."
3,"Humor, Mexican culture and obscure philosophy","Humourous tales of travel, mostly in Mexico. Great insights to Mexican culture. The author is well versed in philosophy and devotes many pages to obscure philosophical discussion. If you want Oaxacan history or touring advice, this isn't the book. I wouldn't seek out his other writings."
1,A Boring Trip,"Oaxaca is an incredible place, but this book sadly manages to make it seem boring with its imprecise and inflated prose. He comes off as a stick in the mud."
1,Poor Design,"I was disappointed in this multi-pot set. I bought it primarily for cooking pasta, but because the strainer/colander doesn't fit far enough down into the pot, you have to fill the pot to almost full to cover the noodles, much more water than you would ordinarily use, and therefore it takes longer to heat, once it did start boiling, the water spit out from under the colander and worst of all, I wanted to wash the pot right after cooking but I had a hard time carrying the 3 gallons of very hot water to the sink.I don't have a big steamer and I think this pot might serve well for a crab boil or something like that. And it's very pretty. But disappointing for pasta."
1,Horrible design,I never use this pot. The pasta insert sits far too high inside the pot. Thus I have to use several quarts more water than is necessary. Not crazy about having twice as much scalding water than required sitting around. The quality of the pot is good; just extremely poor design.
3,Good value,"For $30 you can't beat the value. I had to give the item a 3 because of the design, when boiling pasta with the insert in place water boils over and gets everywhere, even with the heat turned down enough to maintain a slight boil water comes out in copious amounts. Both the pan and insert are of superior quality and a similar set would be in excess of $100 anywhere else."
1,Fail,"Bah. A word of warning to those of you out there. There is an audio defect with this BD. It only outputs at regular old DD 5.1, NOT the True HD its supposed to. Funmation is offering a replacement program if you get a bad one, so i sent out for that and just got a replacement in, but it was kinda beat up and in a little cardboard sleeve. I should have just sent it back to amazon. Do NOT buy this unless you want to gamble on getting an inferior soundtrack"
3,Disappointing.,"The first Warrior was just insane, a little hard to follow, but it added to the excitment. This installiment is bigger in every way, so why isnt it just as good? Well I guess the more money spent doesn't make a better movie. Started off interesting, good story, but all the computer effects and a lackluster soundtrack kinda bring this one down, try it again guys but please stick to what gave this moive its flare."
3,More of the same.,"Not great, not bad. In many ways it's a simple re-hash of the original plot, bringing back all the old characters even though doing so undermines the original story.As such, it lacks the creative spark that made the original so amazing."
3,"Fun, but nowhere near as good as the first one.","If you could compare the original Afro Samurai to a innovative new game, Resurrection is more of an expansion pack than a sequel. It opens up with a cliched depowering of the hero Afro and rehashes the original's plot with some twists. The quality of the animation is superb as well as the art. The music is good, but doesn't seem to be as good of an effort as the first one. Afro really doesn't go through any significant character development and by the end of the movie is right back where he was at the end of the last movie. Its fun for a rental but I regret buying it. Make sure you watch till the end of the credits for a teaser scene."
4,Good,"I enjoyed it and the Director's Cut box has some cool art and bonuses inside. I just can't rate it 5 because the film itself isn't as good as the 5 episodes that preceded it. So it's good, but not great"
4,Love the art in the movie,"Absolutely loved this movie. Owned it on DVD first and decided to buy it on Blu-Ray as well. The quality difference between the two was astounding. Absolutely love the artwork in this movie. The story line leaves a bit to be desired but the action was non stop so I still enjoyed it quite a bit. As for the extras, well there really aren't any."
2,SUPER TRASH,"SERISOULY IM SUPER AFRO FAN HAVE A TATTOO ON MY ARM THIS IS SO BAD COMPARED 2 THE FIRST 1.1.KUMA IS IN THE MOVIE N DOES NOT FIGHT N WHEN HE DOES IS KILLED WITH EASE NOT BY AFRO """"SERIOSULY"""".

I SUGGEST A INUYASHA MOVIE AFRO 1 OR A DBZ MOVIE OVER THIS ANYDAY"
3,Afro Samurai: Resurrection - Director's Cut - Blu-ray Info,"Version: U.S.A / FUNimation Entertainment / Region AMPEG-4 AVC BD-50 / AACS / High Profile 4.1Aspect ratio: 1.78:1Running time: 1:40:33Feature size: 24,19 GBDisc size: 42,19 GBTotal bit rate: 32.08 MbpsAverage video bit rate: 29.99 MbpsNumber of chapters: 21Subtitles: NoneDolby Digital Audio English 640 kbps 5.1 / 48 kHz / 640 kbps"
5,Epic has a new Hairstyle,"Fans of Feudal Era anime will love this title, as the follow up to the original story, Resurrection is exciting and truely a good time. The Afro Samurai series is not for the faint of heart and this movie is no exception. Explosions, severed limbs, and plenty of eye candy, this is one to put at the top of your collection.Fans of Samuel L. Jackson will also enjoy this plenty of his signiture ""F"" bombs to go around.So definately pick this one up.I give it a 10/10."
5,Defending The #1 Headband,"The Resurrection was a good follow up to the original in every way. They were a little more wide open with their ideas in this one. There is plenty of blood, guts, foul language, sex scenes and even a little comedy in this one. There is another banging soundtrack to go with this one as well! If you picked up the first one, you will enjoy this one as well. After seeing the whole series, I went ahead and purchased Afro Samurai the game for Xbox 360. I will probably get the soundtracks as well."
2,afro samuri 2nd season,"Has no where near the level of entertainment value as the first season.Not even a season really,just a movie."
5,Magic of the Celtic Otherworld,"This took a while to arrive, but it is in perfect condition. The content is exactly what I am looking for in my studies."
5,A scent Flowers and Relaxation,"I have loved this perfume for many years and have never gotten tired of it. Its wonderful floral scent just relaxes me whenever I put it on, it always puts me in a great mood. I enjoy this perfume because it is a unique scent, whenever i put it on whether in the morning or at night i feel calm and just feel like iam putting my face in a bouquet of flowers. This perfume also makes for a perfect gift."
1,Not the real thing,"I've used Cabotine for the past ten years. I was very excited to find it at such a good price on Amazon, that I purchased two bottles. What a huge disappointment. I don't know who they think they are fooling. Well, obviously me. The smell lasts about five minutes, then it is gone. And, it doesn't even smell like Cabotine for those short five minutes! This is not the Eau De Parfum I was expecting. Now I have two 3.4 ounce bottles that I don't know what to do with. I'm not going to waste more time and money and send it back, so I guess I'll just have to throw them away. This is the last time I will buy any perfume from Amazon, and I'm definitely letting everyone I know know what happened to me so they don't experience the same thing."
3,Cabotine Parfums,Cabotine Parfums Gres for Women smells OK out of the bottle but loses its scent quickly. I think it was old material. I would not reorder it.
1,Cabotine,"Yuck. Smells nasty, cheap and synthetic. Bitter yet cloyingly sweet at the same time. Do not ask me how they pulled that one off. Kind of scared me off all Gres products despite the tempting price tag. Lots of lily, do not detect any nectarine or musk."
4,Still Wonderful,"I used to wear Cabotine when I was younger - in fact I still have the Cabotine tote. During a purchase of Chanel No. 5 I found this wonderful gem, again. It is still my favorite for lite dinners and such - it is full of spice and exotic essances! I am very happy to have found this wonderful scent again...enjoy."
5,Diabetes Management,Glucerna Oatmeal Raisin Mini Bars have proven to be an excellent food tocontrol and manage diabetes.Diabetics should ask their doctor if Glucerna Oatmeal Raisin Mimi Barswould be helpful in contolling and managing diabetes.
1,Not for diabetics - too much sugar,"For diabetics these are too sweet. These tiny bars are 60% carb of which 2/3rds are sugars+sugar alcohols. To call these ""A delicious snack for people with diabetes"" while containing so much sugar is inappropriate. They could easily reduce the level of sugars, rather than claiming being ""low glycemic"" somehow compensates for the problem, but my guess is that keeping the sugar level high will get people to crave more rather than being satisfied with just one.I will not be raising my blood sugar levels with this junk, i'm tossing them and making my own bars with lower sugar levels and no splenda, or its equivalent, junk. Try Alton Brown's protein bar recipe with half the fruit and replacing the apple juice with soy or cow milk. The result is just sweet enough to be pleasant, but not so sweet as these to make you crave more."
4,These are good for what they are,"They taste good for what they are, a no sugar diabetic bar. Your not going to get much better than this, unfortunately. So if your a diabetic like me & are looking for a decent snack, this will probably work OK for you."
4,delicious with great gmi.,"between meals or even for a quick breakfast, these bars do the trick. this is my favourite flavour and the only bar without chocolate. i am type I diabetic and have extreme highs and lows. i can eat these bars as a snack or to boost my blood sugar, without tons of calories. the gmi is low, so it prevents that diabetic bounce, from low to high, you can get when you eat a snack.this flavour has been impossible to find in my local stores, so i was thankful to find them on amazon. save even more by signing up for subscribe and save."
5,Glucerna Snack Bars,"These are delicious Glucerna Snack Bars which are now imposible to find in retail stores. Glucerna, unfortunately, discontinues making product lines when they introduce new products (like their cold cereals). Apparently, they can't chew gum and walk at the same time!!!!!"
1,Not received,This item was not received. I just realized that when I received your request for an review. Please look into it
4,There are great product.,These lids are fit only Calphalon One Infused Anodized. I tried put it on other calphalon products but it does not fit at all. Calphalon One Infused Anodized cost you more than other calphalons but you are able to use metal utensils without damaging a surface. I'm very happy with them.
3,Pretty Entertaining,"Basically this game is Dynasty Warriors, with some strategy elements. Or better yet Dynasty Warriors for people who like RTS games and fantasy elements. It's very long, so if your like me, cheap and hate buying $50 games that only last maybe 10 hours. the lack of multiplayer, and custom soundtrack really sucks though."
4,flawed but still fun,"This game is really fun from the get go. theres lots of action and you get to control up to hundreds of people at a time, which keeps you engaged. sometimes there are quirks and the dialogue isnt that interesting, but the missions are fun and the overall gameplay is good. another good feature is the barracks where you can upgrade your troops, buy better equipment, and learn new skills. i agree with the other reviewers that you'd always want to rent a game first to see if its for you, but this one will keep you busy."
3,Disappointing,"I was really looking forward to this game and seemed it would have something different that what set it apart and make it a great game. Well it didn't, it has the best graphics for it genre and a few more added features but when it comes down to it the game just fell short for me.Cons-Voice acting and plot gets really annoying-Levels are extremely difficult if you try to use your own strategy then what the game intended (So much for making your own strategy)-Most of defeating a squad is killing its leader (kind of disappointing when you were hoping for a large scale combat)-If you fail at the end of a mission you have to start it all over again. (This gets repetitive)Pros-The Heroes have some really nice moves (Great eye candy)-Setting up ambushes was a nice feature (Send one man to lure an entire army right into a trap)-The Calvary charge was pretty cool (Storm a whole bunch of infantry men)Overall the game wasn't horrible but it isn't anything to get excided over."
3,"Nice Darkelves, But Little Else",I wanted to like this game but it isn't really giving me much to work with. The only thing I like about this game are the half-naked darkelves. That's about it. The battlefield simulation is woefully inadequate. The soldiers never quite pay attention to your commands. I hate to say it but the battlefield simulation of Dynasty Warriors is soooo much better. At least you can distingish between a standard soilder and an officer. This game tried to do so much and failed miserably.
4,It is under $20! Buy it!,"I would totally recommend this game for any RTS fan. Of course there are little issues with this game but c'mon, who hasn't given their troop an order just to have them accidentally run into a flaming forest and die? If you liked Starcraft and Warcraft, well this game is for you. Excellent Graphics, customization of your troops, and a pretty good story line. Yes sometimes the dialogue can be cheesy but you know what, IT IS A VIDEO GAME! You want Shakespeare or something? Plus the game is from Korea, give'em a break. The controls are not that difficult to master if you do the tutorials and the first few missions are basically for training anyway. At under $20 this is one of the best games out there.....Just upgrade your archers to Long-bowmen as soon as you can and you'll have no problems."
3,it's ok if u like good and bad games,I heard a lot about this game on halo 2.they said it was fun but it was a little hard to control and it is only for people who like fantasy/real time games.And when i get this game i hope it is fun see you online
4,"Dynasty fans beware, A better game is in the market","a game which you really have to get the Dynasty warrior habit out. You actually have to think!! No more simple hack and slash but with commandable troops. This game perfected the Dynasty warriors concept by adding strategic factors, for examples: Sunlight, terrain, unit management, and commandI loved the fact that u can equip your troops instead of presetsFor the most part, it was a game that stessed on realism of medival conquest with a hint of fantsy magic.IF You were dis-satisfied by dy-nasty warriors this will probably please u if ur into these kinda games.EDCATIONAL FACTOR!? At least you learn about medieval weaponry, strategy and siege weapons. thats good enough, right?U can also expand your mind to the theme and philosphy of this game tooDurability!? what the... its a dvd rom, u know how this is"
4,This is going ot be a sleeper Hit,I played the demo for this game and it is great!! The way you can lead armys and the graphics in the game are the best. If you liek a midevil type of RTS game then this is the one to get. Also it is on xbox live so you can face a friend or somebody across the world. Tey only reason i gave it a 4/5 is because the voice acting could have been better but dont let that stop you from buying this great game.
3,"Not Good, but not bad","The interface is extremely clunky. Graphics are great for the X-box, but the story is not that entertaining. The Physics of the game (such as sunlight in your face) is unique. If you can get it on the cheap I would recommend it."
2,controls are horrible,"i gave this game about 4 hours to become fun, and ultimately I wish I had those 4 hours back. you'll be excited when you get cavalry, but that excitement will disappear quickly when you realize you have to manually run them back and forth through the enemy while your hero is getting sliced up, and that you have to do this with a very clunky camera system. i think for real-time strategic war games you're better off on a pc. pick up starcraft or any of a thousand other RTS title out there that blow KUF away."
3,Macho Junk,"Okay, I expected this to be about the crusades, no, its about the ""Demon Crusade"". Although the poor lines, and hilarious cheesyness can make you laugh so hard, but only for the first few levels, then its not fun, its boring."
4,Scone Pan,"This is a specialized pan. It seems well made for the home cook. The packaging states it is for scone making and for making corn bread wedges. I don't expect to use it to make corn bread wedges. I think it can also be used to make wedge shaped biscuits and other low raising items, like, perhaps short bread cookies.So far I have made a couple of batches of scones with it, they all came out of the pan well in part due to the nonstick coating (scones do tend to have a rather high fat content). Once I followed the recipe on the packaging; that recipe produced nice scones.Not much more to say."
5,Nordic Ware,Love this pan! No stick and very easy clean up. My scones and corn bread comes out perfect every time.
4,Happy Mom,"After years of searching, I found this non-stick scones pan for my mother-in-law. She's more of a cornbread gal, but just had to make scones the day after she opened her gifts. Her old pan has lost its non-stick surface so everything was hard to get out of the wedges. Thanks Amazon and thanks Nordic Ware."
1,full disclosure please,"Have not usued pan yet. Purchased because of good price.When I received the pan I noticed a sticker on top pan wrapper with a big ""IR"" onit, I take it this means irregular. Is this the reason for the good price, because it is a ""second"". Pan has small defects but maybe these will not affect the the useoutcome. I gave the rating a 1 star because the product was not advertised as an irregular item."
2,Not So Great,This is a nice pan. Scones do not stick and are easy to remove. But the bottoms are under cooked and do not brown on the bottom. I have to turn the scones over to cook properly. Very disappointed. Would not recommend this pan.
1,Could not get into it,"I couldn't get into this book. I hate when that happens. I was expecting a great read and while it didn't work for me, it worked for others as is evident by the other reviews. Better luck next time."
4,Makes me want to watch the movie...,It's obvious that a lot of thought went into choosing these songs. I get a mental image of the direction the movie takes as I listen. The fact that the vocals are all done by females isn't lost on me either. I'd give it 5 stars but I just didn't care for a couple of tracks. I still highly recommend this CD!
4,Go watch the movie first !,"I recommend that you watch the movie first to to get into the mood--It is very touching. The soundtrack is a melting pot of artists with different interesting styles. The scene during which Ann is mourning her beloved cousin is very touching--especially with Sarah McLachlan's ""I will remember you"" on the background. I had expected that song to appear on the album. Overall, this soundtrack is outstanding ! Go and get it!"
4,I wish,"I thought the song was great. Lisa Loeb has a way of sharing the song with you. You are there and apart of the conversation. I don't know. It's hard to explain. But I do find that her songs say what it is and not just alot of metaphors, leaving people guessing."
2,"Anything, but not songs!","In this album, there is a lot of SONG, a lot of SONG, SONG and SONG again. Very desapointed! If You please, make an album for the score of Danny Elfman! Track #15 is my fevorite and it's the best track in this CD. ANYTHING BUT NOT A SONG!"
4,Awesome Music,This is an older movie that I watched again recently and realized what an awesome soundtrack it had. Great female artists. The only problem was that the very last track didn't play well but it was just a musical score. I was a bit disappointed in that because it is beautiful.
4,Good Music,"I bought this CD for the KD Lang song as well as the instrumental by Danny Elftman but was pleasantly surprised to find many more. ""Everything around me is changing"" by Sinead Lohan (who is also on Message in a Bottle soundtrack) is one of my favorites. Definately a ""girl"" feel type of album."
4,absolutely great,"The best song for me is 'leaving's not leaving' by Le Ann Rimes. When I first heard the song, I immediately could relate to it because I went to visit a dear friend in another country, I did not feel like leaving. I had such a wonderful time there that this song sums up what I really feel like when the plane took off from the airport"
3,Satisfying,"Like Natalie Portman said in the film, 'too sunny' is the way to describe this soundtrack. It's songs, besides it's excellent title track by k.d. lang, have no relation with the film's story. But, 'Ice Cream' and 'Everything Around Me Is Changing' by Sarah Maclachlan and Sinead Lohan respectively carry the soundtrack to a higher level compared to other recent soundtracks. The Danny Elfman score is also exceptional. But the fact that most of the songs are too irritatingly 'poppy', makes this CD a near miss. Nevertheless, this makes a great companion to the DVD, which is one of the best 'actor's films' i have seen in quite awhile."
1,Is this woman crazy?,"According to this book, the only reason that little old ladies and ugly women don't have men lining up for them is because of women's ""fearsome dimensions"", which men prefer covered up with youth and prettiness. Yeah, I'm sure that's why intimidating badass Laura croft and mankiller Catherine Trammell (Basic Instinct) loom so largely in men's fantasies-because they're young, pretty, and most of all, apparently nonthreatening-NOT! If you are a smart, strong girl or woman who assumes that the reason you're not as popular as a cheerleader, model, or stripper is because of looks/youth factors beyond your control, don't read this book. It's YOUR fault for not being motherly enough. Or difficult enough. Or dressing sexier. Or dressing more uniquely.The book actually advocates all these things at the same time, as they seemed to work for some women in the past. Actually, Betsy, some people are just lucky. And some are born rich, and some born pretty."
2,Interesting but Flawed,"Book is interesting when dealing with the biographies of the historical 'Seductresses'. However too much reliance and credence is given to the thoroughly discredited 'Goddess' myth.Attaching credibility to an obvious falsehood taints the entirety of the book. One can only wonder, then, how much of the rest of the book is credible."
5,About Time,"Thank God for Betsy Prioleau, who eviscerates both bimboboobism and feminine angst about how, when, why, and even whether to make love when you want to. This is a great blow for ecstaticliberty, for men, women, and all between. May her cup runneth over, and her wonderful book arrive at its rightful place on the best seller lists."
3,"Fascinating, but Flawed","Interesting thumbnail sketches of numerous female libertines of various categories. These were women who lived life on their own terms in many ways, including being sexually unrestrained.However, the book is seriously marred by Prioleau's thoroughly irritating writing style. I was completely put off by her attempts to affect a breezy writing style that came off, rather, as smirky and superficial. I had to put the book down several times before I could finish it, as I found myself grinding my teeth in reaction to her tortured prose."
1,not for aquatic turtles,"this would not suit one aquatic turtle, much less multiples. it could maybe make a good pond area for a land tortoise, but to keep any kind of turtle in there as a habitat would be cruel. i have two little baby red eared sliders both about 2"" and they are in a 55 gallon tank with heating, filtration, plants, and lighting in a basking spot that's bigger than this product.owning turtles or any type of reptile is not like owning a dog or cat, it requires a lot of care and attention. especially your aquatic variety. i would advise anyone considering getting a reptile to do some research on the care before making any kind of trip to pick up the animal. search for the research materials firstRed-Eared Sliders (General Care and Maintenance of Series)Aquatic Turtles (Complete Herp Care)Turtles (Responsible Pet Care)Turtles & Tortoises for DummiesDO NOT buy this product for any aquatic turtles!!!!"
3,An interesting look...,"This book takes an interesting perspective on three very influential men in the counseling and psychology fields. The author seems to have a bit of an affinity for Freud, and therefore seems slightly protective of his memory; willing to find any inconsistencies the the stories of Adler and Jung to support the integrity of Freud. However, the stories he reports about all of the men and their lives are very enthralling, if not somewhat incomplete. This book provides a good introduction to these men and their work."
4,A great PowerPoint presentation,"This book is essentially an expanded PowerPoint presentation, and I mean that in the best possible way. It is direct, to-the-point, practically applicable, and based on a solid change model (ADKAR). Note that it is a mere 90 pages or so of text, so it is a quick read. If you are a consultant or looking to apply change management principles tomorrow, this is the perfect book for you. The case studies are, however, laughable. One has to do with someone wanting to repave a parking lot and hasn't gotten the buy-in of all the surrounding business owners -- hardly the strategic change some of us are faced with managing."
4,"A great, first introduction to change management","This is a very simple, easy to read introduction about change management. Something to start with, but don't expect too much out of it if you have already worked on change management. This is for beginners. But it's great nonetheless."
4,Concise yet informative book on change management,"I had to read this book for a class, but I actually ended up enjoying it. As others have noted, it's a very quick read. But the pages it has are packed with excellent insights and observations gleaned from a number of studies and surveys. The ADKAR model is solid, and even if not followed to the letter will still give you the basics of what you need to consider when planning for and implementing change in an organization.All the project plans in the world won't lead to a successful change if the people affected are neglected."
5,Love the poster:))),"I purchase the poster for my son, he is a huge fan of Einstein. We had the poster laminated. The size was perfect, and the quote are a great size, No complaints, if your looking to buy this poster. I definately recommend this poster as an addition to your Einstein collection:)"
3,Jingle with care,"This little instrument did not pass the test of a Spirit-Filled gospel choir. After rehearsal there were more pins and cymbals in the chair and on the floor than in the tambourine. However, I resourcefully replaced the pins and cymbals back into their original configuration, but this time I reinforced the pins with scotch tape, and- Hallelujah! We've been jingling ever since."
5,Magnificent,"I have seen this film several times in a theater or classroom and enjoyed it. But Criterion produced a much sharper image than I had ever seen before. We watched it with a woman who works with horses, and she was amazed at the horses in the film. The fighting scenes were excellent, and she marvelled at White Mane in the fire. The boy Falco is still a wonderful character to watch, pure and determined. Their escape into the water is tragic to watch. What joy when your previously enthusiastic pleasure increases through a fresh viewing."
2,Too much Reality?,"I wish that this film had not contained so much ""reality"" - I can't bear watching animals being hurt or hunted or abused - even by their own kind. I accept that it is ""natural"", but I choose not to watch animals put in painful situations, for my entertainment."
1,Disappointing for animal lovers,"After reading the other reviews, I was very anxious to see this movie. I was greatly disappointed. While the black and white scenery is amazing, the graphic fighting of horses and the cruelty with which the herdsmen chase the horse is very sad. The ending is surprisingly wrong. This is not a movie for children or animal lovers."
5,Very pleasant and fun,"The concept of Chulip is not to beat your enemies up to a pulp, but to simply kiss them. Yes, kiss them. That is what I love the most about this game: It's very innocent and yet also probably one of the most challenging games I've ever played. This game proves that it's not easy to kiss someone. This game will definitely have you addicted. I bought this on a whim because it was so cheap and I've never regretted it ever since."
3,Interesting Concept...but it could be better,"This game had the most interesting concept I have ever seen. You must make a name for yourself and win the heart of the girl by kissing practically everyone in the town. The concept is new and different, but the rest of the game does not match.The dialogue is awful. One particular one that comes to mind was an argument between two parents and the father argues that his daughter likes cats while the mother is screaming at him for being worthless. This may just be poor translation, but the poor dialogue was distracting."
4,The basics of studying God's Word,I was very excited to see that Dr. Bright has added another Transferable Conept to the group. This book is great for individuals who want some guidence in how to walk closer with God and study His word. It begins by explaining WHY to study the bible and they HOW. It is great for new believers or those just beginning to walk with the Lord because it also includes a overview of the whole bible and some guidence as to where to begin reading. This book was very helpful for me and encouraged me to memorize scripture and spend daily time with God.
1,A very pathetic movie not worth the cash,"I paid 7 bucks for this movie but i still fill like its not worth it because theres other movies i could have bout, first off i bought this because im a master p movie fan but this one sucks it doesnt have much shooting parts its only 43 min not 85 like it said its just theres nothing good about this movie dont buy it im warning ou you wont regret unless you have to have all of his movies or something!!!!!"
2,Denial of the Holocaust is the authors purpose.,"Mr. Smith took quite a bit of time finding sources of information that he wished to debunk in this work. Most of arguments follow faulty logic or focus upon weak evidence rather than looking at the whole picture. Little inconsistencies with survivors stories look to be clear evidence of a huge cover-up to Mr. Smith. All in all in interesting, if not well written, insight to an individual who believes in the Big Conspiracy"
4,Hey--Bring This One Back!,"I'll confess up front--I loved this movie! I thought it would be just another Hollywood botch-up of history--and it did take some liberties--but as an adventure and costume epic, it certainly delivered. Omar Sharif and Stephen Boyd seemd to be having a grand time playing their larger-than-life characters; James Mason and Robert Morley were unconvincing as Chinese, but turned in their usual fine performances. The late Francoise Dorleac, sister of Catherine Denueve, is touching and believable as Genghis Khan's beautiful and intelligent wife. This one deserves to be brought back. Don't expect the level of ""Lawrence of Arabia"" or ""Gandhi"" but as an adventure movie, it's colorful and lots of fun."
4,Colorful epic about the life of Genghis Khan.,"This film, made in 1965, is a colorful epic starring Omar Sharif as the powerful ruler. This film begins when the main character is just a young man, and tells about his rise to power, and also his pursuit of the love of his life. It is a powerful movie, with an excellent score. Hard to find video, but well worth it!"
4,Great Old Movie,This has been a favor of mine since I was a kid and it sure brings back memories. I am really happy to be able to find this on DVD and will keep it a long time.
1,GENGHIS KHAN (1965),"I have ordered this Movie to my nephews address in Seattle. I live in Dubai and I did not want for ever to reach here so I chose his address since he was traveling here. I have only received it now and to my utter surprise and with great regret I would like to state that I have received the SPANISH version of the movie. I have No clue how did you guys achieved that. I need an English version of the Movie. What do I do, Can you please tell me that please.....Genghis Khan (1965) ( Dschingis Khan ) ( Dzingis-Kan ) [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2 Import - Spain ]Tariq NiaziDubaiUAE"
1,I am sure Bobby McFarrin was excellent but scottsaucs seller did not send that video,The video came in a Bobby McFarrin case but it turned out to be cartoons.seller scottsaucs made a serious mistake. I did not bother to waste time to return.
2,Rosen's on CD,"While the content of the textbook is excellent, the mechanism of use is horrible. Previous versions allowed you to load the textbook into your laptop for ease of use. With this CD, it must be in the CD drive for you to view the book, as it is browser based. I am not exactly why they made this change, but I would not have purchased the item had I known. It has proven to be more trouble than it is worth, having to load the CD for each use of the book. I use the prior edition due to it's ease of use."
3,typical reference book,"in the years past, rosen's used to serve as ""the"" reference textbook in EM. recently, however, other textbooks (e.g., harwood-nuss) bave become very comparable in breath and depth, for less money. btw, one can use the electronic version without the cd's! (""drchief, DO"" was probably skipping his english class and pc 101 in his osteopathic curriculum)"
4,One of the better ones in the series,"This book is a definite standout when I think of the Nancy Drew books as a whole. It has an intricate, delicately handled plot and the indispensable element of suspense.It tells the story of a girl, searching for her relations against the will of an evil man, who is also the ringmaster of a circus. It is very, very good among its more ordinary siblings . . . as I said before, a definite standout."
2,Boring.......,"Ok, so this book starts out alright, but it gets kinda...ya know....childish? I mean it is NOT that easy to get two civilizations who have been fighting each other for millenia to just quit. It doesn't work like that. Sorry. I would have to say that the only REALLY cool part of this book was the guy they were ferrying around, he makes Kirk so MAD! Really though, it is easy to tell how this book will end RIGHT AFTER YOU START READING IT! I have read ALOT of Star Trek books, and there are MANY out there better than this one. But i have to admit that this MIGHT be a good book for someone new to Star Trek books. If you are new to Star Trek altogether.......WATCH THE SHOW FIRST! Oh, yeah, and have a nice day."
4,DeWeese Rules!,"I read this back when it came out the first time and I loved the story. Gene DeWeese is probably one of the best authors of the novels for the original Enterprise crew. I'm not sure how anyone who enjoys Star Trek novels could think this is boring. I believe that the premise of this book may have had something to do with the development of the TV show Star Trek Voyager. Star Trek novels are rarely of the quality of a good thriller like those of DeMille or Deighton--different target audiences. This book has a sequel entitled The Final Nexus--not quite as exciting, but a good book to read if you enjoy this one."
4,A great pre-voyager book!!!,"Gene DeWeese's book is really a great book for people who are voyager fans and have never seen or read about the original series of Star Trek. I liked how the Enterprise came upon a mystery in another part of space. The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because they make peace with two new alien races, something they do in almost every story. Original, though."
5,"A great novel, very well done","I thought that this novel was a great read , read it a few times and it is enjoyable.because I read it more than twice it got a deserved 5 star."
5,Very enjoyable,"These light, bouncy and inventive arrangements of traditional holiday fare are always tasteful and often charming. I especially like Rudolf / Up on the Housetop where the piano has an old timey feel as if it had been recorded in the 20s. If you find the usual holiday music, whether classical (Handel, Tchaikovsky) or pop (I saw Mommy kissing Santa Claus), overwhelming or banale, this is just the thing. And your guests will salute your good taste: it's svelte and NPR approved!"
1,Somebody call an editor,"Wow - the worst-written baseball bio I've seen in a long time. I grew up a non-Yankee fan, but I always admired Munson. I thought he would be a ripe subject for examination, but Devine's writing just dulls the whole book. Not recommended."
1,Picture Does NOT represent Item,"This product is not the entire mouse, nor does it include the transmitter as shown in the item photo. Don't be disappointed like me! This is a replacement part, not the whole item. It does not come in the manufacturer's packaging and cannot be used on its own. Very disappointed."
5,I LOVE IT,"This mouse works great, in the air or on a surface. I bought it to replace one I dropped too many times so I already had the charger and receiver necessary to use it. Description should make clear that this product is the HANDSET ONLY. Much cheaper than buying the whole thing when only the mouse is needed."
5,(Eon)A stunning masterpiece,"In order to describe just how incredible this book is i would need to be a gifted writer.unfortunately im not so i will keep it simple.Eon is so beautifully detailed and complex yet it neither confuses or loses the reader as the plot gets deeper and more involved.dont get me wrong this is not a book for those out there that get confused by technological garb as the book is heavily laden with it.But the rewards of this book far outweigh the one downside.do yourself a favour and get hold of a copy,it is probably one of the best sci-fi novels you will ever read."
5,Innovative and suspenful,Good science fiction should be innovative in the future it describes and suspensful in the story telling. Eon is a great example of both of these characteristics.
3,Worth reading..but Rama was better.,"Bear does an exellent job in this book however, it does suffer a couple of flaws. First, as others have pointed out it has aged badly. Written in 1985 the early parts of the book (which focus on earth in 2000-2004)simply don't match up with real history. This flaw is less noticable in the second half of the book but still hurts Eon badly. If you have not read Rama by Clarke I would suggest it as a better book. The secon major problem with this book is the length. To much time is spent developing detail that does not pertain directly to the main plot. It's worth reading, just don't expect another RAMA."
4,A fantastic storyline,"Mr. Bear's creative imagination worked overtime on this novel. The story is absolutley incredible if a bit confusing. I rushed through a first read because I liked the plot, but a more liesurly second read will clear up much of the back and forth and in and out. I happen to like the detail, especially when combined with his extrodianry gift for precise desciption. I highly recommend this book. Although there is alot of hard science in the story, I don't think that should restrict it to hardcore scifi fans only. The sequel, Eternity, is also recommended."
2,When Length Overcomes Good Content,"This novel is far to long and tedious. The Sci-Fi twists were interesting, but they were so submerged in a mass of words and unnecessary subplots that it was difficult to maintain interest. It's really a pity that the author didn't cut it down to a more readable size and focus on the main themes. If it had been a bit more ""crisp"" and focused, it probably would be one of the best Science Fiction stories of recent years."
4,Excellent Reading,"I don't know how I missed this gem in my years of reading sci fi. I even read alot of Greg Bear's other books as well.I loved this book from beginning to end. And it amazes me that it was written 20 years ago. Mr. Bear's vision of the future as indicated in this book is fabulous.I can see how the other reviewers may think this is too confusing, it is very scientific. But then again I love reading crazy theories and different dimensions.In short I highly recommend this book and very pleased to see that there is a sequel!"
2,Dont Bother,"This is such an obvious rehash of Clark's Rendevous With Rama, and not written half as well. Rock orbits earth, mission sent to investigate, herione is kidnapped, strange aliens encounters, etc., etc.Character development is pretty thin also and there's a lot of technological jargon about singularities, etc. Fine if you're into the theory of black holes and such, but doesn't do much to move the store along.Get the Rendevous With Rama series instead."
1,Big Waste of Time,"I could go on and on about how this book goes on and on... In short, this is one of those books that you finish reading not because you enjoy reading it. You finish it because, as I kept thinking whenever I picked it up, ""I've put so much time into this. I can't put it down now. Finish already so I can start something else!"""
2,Wordy and wooden,"Greatest sci-fi epic ever. Not! Complexity and emotion in the characters. Not! Well-written. Not! Sorry, but after slaving through this 150,000 word tome, I felt cheated. I could have had a V-8 :) The characters are shallow, wooden stick figures. Bear spends a lot of time creating a family for Patricia, then drops it like a, well, potato :) He didn't have the imagination to bring them back in at the end like any good author would have, and have events lead to psychological self-discoveries. You can get that much in a TV movie of the week! The sole positive is his apparent superficial study of relativity theory and topology, and his plot device of the Stone itself. But even that seems to degenerate from almost pseudo science to pure magic and fantasy muck by the ""geometrically increasing"" end. And he did what? Wrote a sequel? Yiyiyi!"
2,Big disappointment,"Friends and colleagues had hyped this book for years, so I finally bought it and slogged through its 500+ pages.The book suffers from a common failing of ""hard"" science fiction: a lack of humanity. Bear does try by providing a three dimensional heroine, but focus on her is constantly lost in anachronistic machinations of Cold War politics and nearly unintelligible Thistledown politics.Also: Thistledown is never fully explained and never fully presented to us as an understandable place where humans or their descendents live; characters like the Jarts seem thrown in only to goose the plot; the explanation of time and universe travel was inadequate (how can a divining rod be the mechanism for finding Patricia's proper space and time?); and the romantic scenes, although appreciated by my prurient and adolescent mind, seem to be tacked on as an afterthought and unrealistic insofar as who chases whom."
3,What if Tom Clancy rewrote Rendezvous with Rama?,"Greg Bear adds one or two interesting ideas to the Giant Cylindrical Alien Ship that Visits Earth franchise created by Arthur C. Clarke in Rendezvous with Rama, but for the most part Eon reads like Rama rewritten by Tom Clancy. There's way too much military intrigue and Soviet drama - even allowing for the story's last days of the cold war publication date."
2,A slow read.,"It seemed to take eons to finish this book. There is a relentless supply of details, presented in a dull and matter of fact manner. These quickly dominate the book and distract from the interesting story hidden within. Details are normally good, but here it is too much of a good thing. Any sense of wonder or amazement was so short lived that it became meaningless. Very early on it became a labor for me to continue reading. I had hoped things would pick up at some point. They didn't."
4,Interesting Concept,"Eon starts out with a bang of nuclear proportions that instantly had me hooked. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is the characters could have used a little better development. What Greg Bear lacks in this early effort he more then makes up for with new (at least to me), interesting and mind blowing ideas and concepts. I wish Hollywood script writers had 1/10th Greg's imagination. I was immediately sucked in and could not put it down, always wondering what was coming next. If your looking for some newer science fiction on the grand scale of Dune, Foundation, Rendezvous With Rama or Childhood's End checkout Eon."
5,Looping ride through multiple dimensions,"Would our mathematics explain this book? Maybe not, but it posits a world bigger on the inside than on the outside. Can people travel between different universes? Does it take machinery and energy? What kind?A space expedition discovers an asteroid that raises all these questions and more. There are multifaceted characters, fast-paced timing, events spinning out of control. Good clashes with evil.This is so good you will want to savor it in a second reading."
2,"Too Long. . . Yet, Not Long Enough","This book should have either been chopped down to about 300 pages with a majority of the very hard science eliminated.However, if you like the very, very difficult physics concepts then this book should probably have been expanded to a trilogy. There is simply not enough time for the author to do justice to either the characters, plot or hard science concepts in the 500 pages. Many of the characters and scientific concepts are introduced and then quickly integrated into important portions of the action without adequate explanation or investigation into what makes them tick."
3,"Disjointed, confusing, but hardcore SciFi","The absolutely blatent plagerizing of Arthur C. Clarke's ""Rendevous With Rama"" series aside, this book is a fairly healthy mix of harcore science fiction (heavy on the physics) and absolutely random tangents of plot that go nowhere.I found the book unsatisfying in story development and resolution, but interesting enough in theoretical creativity to balance it out."
1,"""I Just Could Not Get Into It.""","I got up to around 100 pages before I put this book down. The premise sounded good and I liked the potential conflict with the Soviets over the strange asteroid that settled in Earth orbit. But the tour through the Stone and the explanations of its features seemed very matter-of-fact and failed to hook me. Some of the characters were a bit stiff. I would have liked to have seen more inner reaction about all the Stone's wonders from the main character, Patricia."
2,Was My Copy Missing Pages?,"I was drawn into this story by the character of Patricia Vasquez, a young mathematician whose brilliant mind might hold the key to understanding the Stone, an asteroid which suddenly appears above Earth in the year 2000, yet which seems to contain in its hollowed-out core the artifacts of a human civilization. Patricia was enough to get me past the fact that in the book the US is still involved in the Cold War, with Communist characters spouting predictable party jargon at every opportunity. But as the fictional world took more and more turns toward the bizarre, with less and less explanation or character development, I was lost. By the end I wanted to ask the publisher to send me the missing pages that would explain the 502 I had just read."
2,Try Greg Egan instead,"If you like hard science fiction, I would recommend trying Permutation City and Diaspora by Greg Egan instead. Another book more similar to Eon but far more readable is ""Rendezvous with Rama"" by Arthur C. Clarke (not the sequels). Greg Bear wasn't able to convey the sense of wonder of the situation he describes, in fact, sometimes I have found very hard to understand his descriptions, as others reviewers say (not because of their technicallity, but simply because they are sometimes very convoluted). Also, part of the plot seems outdated, be aware that this book was published in 1985 (USSR, Cold War...). I haven't been able to read past a third of the book, so this review may be a bit biased ;)"
3,Some good ideas poorly presented,"Never having read Greg Bear before I wasn't sure what I had in store for me when I picked up Eon. A few chapters into the book I was about ready to give up on Mr. Bear. I could forgive his frequent forays into the technical discussions of hard science fiction. I could forgive his tendency to introduce subjects/objects/phrases and not properly explain them until several chapters later. But I could not forgive the hollow characters who behaved more and more eratically as the story progressed. And I disliked the teasing of what seemed to be potentially important subjects (i.e. the Frants or the increasingly promiscious nature of characters) that went no where.Despite all this, he managed to weave an intriguing enough story that I struggled through these faults and finished the book. I certainly wouldn't put this on any Top X book list, but neither would I toss it in the trash if I received it as a gift."
3,Suffers from old age,"Possibly a masterpiece in 1985, Eon suffers not from Bear's writing, which is excellent, but simply from old age. If, like me, you read Clark's ""Rama"" series, you read the ultimate work in the genre of 'discover artifact and the culture behind it'. Rama came after Eon but the pupil bested the teacher. Today, Eon remains entertaining and will keep you reading but both the cultures of the humans trapped in the Stone and that of its builders are shallow in comparison."
2,"Interesting, but unfinished","Interesting story beginning with the eploration of the classic ""unknown object"", followed by political conflict, at bit of fighting, aliens, and .. the end which is a anti-climax."
4,Challenging read,"This book is definitely of the ""hard"" sci-fi genre, and runs quite long. Sometimes it can be very hard to imagine what Bear is describing, and in that way I agree with the other reviewers here who have called his writing style clunky. The plot is quite complex, and at first it can be hard to remember which character did what. The ending is less than satisfying, and the characters could have been more developed so that the reader cares more about them, but the worlds on the Stone and in the Way are fascinating and so creatively crafted. Just trying to imagine how this world behaves, from a physics point of view, can be enthralling. I also enjoyed the stature of Patricia, the female protagonist. One down-side is that the politics between the US, Russia, and China severely date the novel. It's a strange kind of ""historical"" sci-fi in that you have to recall the climate of the '80s to get a good grasp on many things, but the futuristic aspects are amazing."
1,This item should be recalled,Would like to remove the one star review. This pan is a fire hazard. Grease and fat do not drip into the under pan and can ignite. The grease splatters all over the inside of the oven. Do not buy this pan!
2,not what it was cracked up to be,"The product claims to be non-stick after pre-treating, as directed. NOT TRUE!!! Treated as advised, sprayed and broiled lamb chops. They stuck to broiler pan which then was extremely difficult to clean. In fact, some spots could not be cleaned off at all. If you want non-stick buy something else. I wish I knew beforehand, but beware!! be warned!! All false claims, and don't say I didn't warn you."
2,So disappointed...,"Bought this a year or so ago after searching ""high and low"" for a CLEANABLE small broiler pan. Thought I had found it! After a dozen times used? Now impossible to clean off burnt areas, with the ""white"" fading as noticed by others a short while thereafter. What a disappointment! I have YET to find the broiler pan that is truly cleanable with little or no effort...This one? Well, I can leave for 48 hours in a sink with cold water and the very strong Dawn detergent? NOTHING budges off of it, even with a scrub! I give up! I continue to buy one, use it a year and toss it in the recycle...Seriously a problem!"
1,Horrible to clean; the non nonstick pan,"I thought this broiler pan was nonstick; it is absolutely one of the worst broiler pans to clean I have ever owned. No matter how much we scrub, it doesn't come clean. I have used it for steak and salmon approximately 7 times and it so difficult to clean that I am going to throw it away. It is a false and outrageous claim that it is nonstick. Nothing could be further from the truth. A total waste of money. Don't buy this!!!!"
1,Way tooo big for toaster oven,"I sent them back & got a refund, they were too big for a toaster oven. I guess I didn't read the measurements right or the description, oops!"
2,A Bit Disappointing II,"If you're a Luis Royo fan, which I am, you might like this book. There is no finished artwork, just sketches. While it provides insight into the development of Royo's work, I found it a bit disappointing."
3,More like 3 1/2 stars...,"These ex-My Name guys (the vocalist & one of the guitarists, anyway) shed their punky/jazzy/funky tendencies to turn in a much more straight-forward punk rock record. This is on ALL's label (Owned & Operated) and was co-produced by ALL's drummer, Bill Stevenson. Unsurprisingly -- like many of the bands that the guys in ALL have had their hands in, this record comes out sounding very much like (surprise!) an ALL record.Not that that's bad -- ALL is a great band, and bands can do worse then to emulate that style. This amounts to an above-average punk record that will sure to please ALL fans, and other fans of the genre. The prank call at the end is only average, and is probably the least-entertaining thing on the record. The last song -- ""Happy Song"", is my personal favorite.They are currently on tour with (you'll never guess) ALL. Coming to a city near you..."
2,The editor is fired,"This book could have been so much better. The story had such rich potential but reads like a poorly written paper. The editors of this book did not do Jennifer's story justice by any means. I can understand the desire to keep things in her own words, but publishing it with misspellings, grammatical errors, and inconsistency in the names of the children (in statements Jeffrey is referred to as Jamie, etc.) is just bad form and drastically detracts from the story."
2,Escape from the Dungeon,This book had such possibilities but fell short. Constant references to police reports and rehashing of the same lines over and over again made this story not only boring but irritating.
2,not well written,"This book did not keep my interest. it is a tragic story, but the author is lacking in writing skills."
3,could have been shorter,"It was an interesting book, however the author repeated a lot of the same information over and over. Didn't stay in one time period, jumped back and forth from past to present, often found it distracting due to this."
2,Horrible grammar and spelling!,"I can't believe how awful this book was to read. Did nobody proof read it? Also, it just seemed like a list of crimes listed over and over wasting pages and pages. I realize this was a terrible woman, but I feel like the book could have been written much better."
4,SVAT CVQ1000 Review,"Great product. Very pleased. Each camera has a 60 ft. cable, picture clarity is great, simple male-female connections. On the down side...IR range is about 10 ft. or less, and You'll need some 90 degree brackets if You want to keep the image verticle. Processing was very speedy,payed extra for express and recieved it in 3 days.First time Amazon shopper and I couldn't be happier."
4,Great for the price,"I have researched different systems for my security needs and the SVAT CVQ1000 is an excellent buy for the cost. Yes the IR is lacking, but with auxiliary IR lighting this short coming was corrected. The very small nature of the cameras at first made me wonder if this system would not be very clear, but I was quickly amazed at the clarity of the images. And with the size of the cameras, hiding them is a breeze. I have had the system hit with some heavy Texas down pours without a hitch. I do not mind only being able to record all cameras in the four split screen mode. My only complaint is the remote is like a child's clicker toy, a bit fragile. I did purchase one more system for a panoramic 360 degree overlapping view of my land around my home."
3,i expected a better product,"the resolution is too poor, i espected someting with more definition, and the timer never works, always show the wrong hour.this sistem only works for small, very small areas.if you want to ensure your house look for other options."
3,SVAT cameras,"It works OK for what it is, I wish a DVD would be made compatible for this unit. I had to return two of the Cameras and received replacements,, took a very long to to get. The daytime pics are good but night time suck.I would spend more money on the next security system I buy to get better quality."
2,not please with this system,"There is two reasons why i am not pleased (1)one of the cameras does not work and (2) night vision is not clear, you can not see any thing beyond three feet.That is why i am giving this 2 stars."
5,Great product,"For the money you could not find a better system, it has features of a system costing hundreds of dollars more. Very easy set up. Clear picture.This system is used for a handicapped person to see what going on outside and to give peace of mind. Great."
3,"Rough, but these guys have potential","I had to give this one about 5 listens to GET what these guys are trying to put across. At first it sound rough and un-polished, but then I realized that they are almost trying to sound like that, because it fits so well with their sound.I keep wanting to say they sound like somebody, but when you give it a good listen they have their own distinct sound. I like Swallow more than the others, very dark and driven.I'd say with some maturity, their next album with likely be a gem."
1,BOWER/BCA 513115,ORDERED 2 EACH BOWER/BCA 513115 SPINDLES; RECEIVED ONE LIKE NEW AND ONE WITH PARTS MISSING (ABS EXICTER RING). I RETURNED BOTH TO AMAZON FOR CREDIT.
2,Too early,I take this product for knee pain and I am told it takes a while to have an effect. At this point I don't really know if it has helped. Too early to know.
5,Excellent overview of Anglo-Irish relations,"This book provides a wonderful look at the past three centuries of Anglo-Irish relations. It is essentially a well-edited compilation of political cartoons from both the English and the Irish press. The use of political cartoons to illustrate this area of history provides unique insight into the often troubled relations between these two nations. Unlike other collections of political cartoons, however, this book does not leave its readers to guess at either the topical content nor at the context of the cartoons. Caricatures are explained in detail, allowing the reader to understand the cartoons in the same context in which they would originally have been read. The text between chapters is succinct and useful. This is an excellent book for readers new to the study of Anglo-Irish relations as well as for students of the field."
1,big mutha truckers 2 sucks,"Yes if you've played the first BIG MUTHA TRUCKERS than you know that it sucked ass,and no this one isn't any better it is still a waste of money so purchase at your own risk!"
3,Poorly organized but an okay overview,"While there are some interesting parts of this book, it ranges all over the place. If you have the time and inclination, you're probably better off reading separate biographies. If not, this book will give you a (poorly organized) overview of the era and of several of the ""movers and shakers."""
3,An inside view of machinations of the power brokers,....Informative but a tough read ...mixing personal anecdotes with historical facts the authors sacrifice continuity and clarity. Not being judgemental the need for checks and balances in the financial world to keep predatators in check from manipulating markets is shown to be a daunting task and sometimes a matter of trying to stay one step ahead of the next scheme ...Capitalism involves risks and rewards and shysters will always try to stack the deck in their favor but sometimes the regulators cause more harm than the speculators .....
5,Money and Power,This is a must have. We need to get back to the old days of doing things in America. This book will show us how. Great book. Fun to read.
3,Dry Read,I am every disappointed. Just finished Meet You in Hell (The Carnegie and Frick story) and it was such a fasinating quick read. This book is dry. Its a labor to finish.
5,Good Book on History of US Money,This book is very interesting if you like history and especially how the American economy and money systems were built. The greed and corruption of some of the people in the book is unbelievable. The way the men in the book complement and offset each other is very cool too.
1,"Poorly written,","Slow, difficult to follow. Hard to maintain interest on a great time in American. Waste of time and moneySstremmel@aol.com"
5,the tycoons,very well written and very interesting content. received as a gift and started reading it right away. enjoying it very much
4,Great Lip Balm,This lip balm feels like silk going on and there's no waxy feel. It smells and tastes great too!
2,"helpful, but...","I highly recommend the book ""The Highly Sensitive Child"" by Elaine Aron to get a different perspective (more positive) on the out of sync child."
5,Great book!,I am a special education teacher for the severely disabled and find the book to be almost my bible. Has many great ideas for all of my students.
5,Out of Sync Child has Fun is excellent purchase,"I purchased this book on a referral from an occupational therapist. The book was an excellent purchase. So many suggestions in the book use simple household items. There is no need to spend a lot of money to creat anything in the book. The book also gives alternative ideas, too! My son, who the book was suggested for, and my daughter (5)love the projects!"
4,Good info for Baja's,"Probably best suoted for people really wanting to go off road, most information aimed at serious off roading but good informatin in general."
3,Good Basic Information,This book is a good basic introduction to get started but is dated and could use more detailed diagrams for the novice.
5,Fun,Loaded with all the info I wanted plus a lot more that I still dream about. Time to build and go drive!
5,Review,"This is a great book on Bugs and Buggies. It is becoming a little dated, and the newest in suspensions are not covered well. I bought my first copy of this book 20 years ago and keep loosing them to friends. This is my 4th copy i've bought and it is still the best referrence book for "" in general "" information on Bugs you can find."
3,Would have been a great read in the late 70's,"I was a little let down as I was looking for a little more modern information.Not a bad book, just don't plan on it helping you build a CORR race car.or a modern buggy for that matter.Would be a great start for a ""Baja Bug"" buildup,a buggy not so much."
4,"""Baja Bugs & Buggies"" Book Review","Booked arrived within a few days of my order. Book is slightly out of date by today's standards, but is great info if you plan on building on old-school style bug or buggy. It was also very informative, and the whole fact that it was vintage was a nice touch, since I'm a sucker for old-school off-roading. My only complaint would be that when the book arrived, it had a slight fold on the top right corner. Not sure what happened. Maybe someone at the post office is getting tired of their job, lol. Just kidding. All-in-all, it's a good book, even if you don't plan on building a car."
4,good overview-not sufficent detail,"Is good as far as letting you know what type of modifications are needed to build a baja buggy or sand rail but does not have much in the way of detail on how to do the modifications in some areas.A good vehicle specific bentley or hayes is needed if working on a vw bug. Also could use more, larger and more detailed illustrations and photos. A good starter."
4,A good read,"This is a good book to get familiar with the ins and outs of building a buggy or a baja bug. The thing I didnt like about it is this; its out dated. Products, suspensions, cars, methods, ect have outgrown this book. However, as stated, if you want to get familiar, this book will help with that."
3,Good book!,"It is a good book, many informations and suggestion that will help you to build your baja.But, a constant problem that I have with US books is the layout.I feel me tired to read so much, It would be better if it had more pictures and infographics to help us understand easily."
4,has many good points,Great information on many of the things you need to know to build one of these cars
1,baja bugs,If I were seventeen again way back in 1984 when this book was written I surely would have found this to be a complete and helpful reference.Unfortunately very little remains useful for someone in 2008.
5,"Escrito em ingls claro e simples, sem ser trivial","Para os que no tem no ingles sua lingua primária, este livro é extremamente simples, pela sua organizao, fotos elucidativas e de extrema qualidade editorial, mostrando que o escritor desenvolveu muito trabalho para sua concluso. Excelente!"
1,Nao espere muito deste livro.,"Se voce esta procurando um livro que ensine como montar um ""gaiola"" ou ""dune bug"", esqueca este livro. Ele fala muito sobre motor, freio, etc. Sobre a estrutura, ou ""frame"", so da algumas dicas de como procurar para comprar. Ridiculo ne !"
1,dangerous book,"I once banged my head on a VW motor while trying to figure out how to check the oil level. Therefore, I think all Volkswagons should be destroyed as a result of them being so dangerous. So, I cannot recommend this book."
4,"Good book, lots of info, but getting dated.","This book is one of the few 'how-to' books available. It has the benefit of being written by an experienced racer (and fireman, so he's concerned with safety, not just going fast). It emphasizes the important parts of keeping a VW engine alive in rough conditions, prepping suspension, and gives the reader ideas on interior layout, lighting, and pros and cons of a variety of issues. Too bad it is getting dated; the massive changes in the past ten years for engines and suspensions are not included."
3,Might be ok for camping,"I bought this because I wanted to make pancakes at home. Unfortunately, it is not good for my stove which is a glass cooktop. The pan is too light so you have to hold it down while trying to get the spatula under the pancakes. The bottom is slightly warped too because it is so light and aliminum. This slight warping makes it unsuitable for glass cooktops because you can't get consistent even heating across the pan even if you have the bridge option on your cooktop designed specifically for using a griddle. It might be better suited for a gas stove or a camp stove. I'll probably save it for my camping gear and go get a heavier version of cast iron or something. The nonstick works fine too."
3,Sam Elliott!!,"I really like Sam Elliott and that voice! The movie was ok, but I really like Sam Elliott (did I mention that voice!) Does he do the tough guy role great? Any other type of role just wouldn't do."
3,great stuff,I love elliot especially in his cop roles. This is great as he plays a pissed-off cop who bitches about life & kicks the crap out of everyone. A great guy movie
1,sam elliott lover,"Don't know what the movie ended up being like, the language was too filthy so we just stopped it."
5,A devastating and harrowing statement about the insights of the War!,"""The human condition"" is an emblematic film, that rescues and captures the dignity of the human being , as well as a variegated set of different human features through the war.As an extended symphony, Masaki Kobayashi displays three great movements. Manchuria, 1943. The disappointed humanism of our protagonist when he is assigned to a concentration prisoners camp(uncapable to make his expectations come true), leads him to experience the hellish ambiance when he is imprisoned and so, to suffer in own flesh the horrors of a close death until unbearable limits.This is without any shadow of doubt, one of the most towering,absorbing antibelic films ever made, that requires all your whole attention.A sumptuous masterwork, and one of the two masterpieces of Kobayashi (The other is Harakiri).Unmissable!"
5,Great live performance,"I was one of a group of people that went to Blues Alley one night (Washington,DC)and I got to hear Civisca for the first time. I bought his Live CD and have not stopped listening to it. As a musician, I must say, this cat can swing! The arrangements to these old songs are fresh and exciting to listen to, as well as some very hip changes. It interests me how even though the band is playing in a jazz content, Civisca still controls the song by singing it fairly straight. It works! That evening of the show, in the midst of cigarette smoke and very dry air, Civisca put his heart into a few ballads that made me appreciate this young new singer. I look forward to seeing how this guy grows in the next several years."
4,A nice set,"Michael Civisca is a fine jazz-inspired crooner. This album is far superior to his first album of standards which includes unnecessary back-up singers and synthesizers. This time out, Civisca performs with a trio. It is obvious that he has a great affinity for Steve Lawrence, but he does not copy Lawrence's goofiness; he is truly hip. Along with Jonny Abeles and Tony Babino, Civisca is keeping the music alive and proving that young people are still interested in quality song."
4,Cleveland has discovered Michael Civisca!,"Yeah, baby. This is the place... your favorite little after-hours jazz club... small and intimate. Settle in at your table. You're about to discover a great new talent."
3,"Beautiful, but flawed...","It is a very attractive light fixture, but there are some craftsmanship issues because it doesn't hang down evenly. It tips to one side due to a weight distribution issue. I had to use a counterweight to even it out."
3,Don't buy if you have a flat-top oven,"Granted, it should have been a little more obvious to me that this would not work on my oven after looking at the picture a bit more closely. 1) I have a standard-sized oven and 2) the oven top is a flat-top design. Because of of the size of my oven, I cannot fit it back to front as most griddles are designed to work. Because of the type of my oven (a flat top) I cannot use this because the cooking surface is elevated above the bottom of the pan (there is a reservoir along the sides that is flush with the bottom). If you have gas or electric (with elevated burners) this should work ok for you (although I still cannot gaurantee that it will fit front-to-back)."
5,Ceramic Stovetop,"I've read the previous reviews about not being able to use it with this type of stove, but I have had no problems!! It works great! I was able to make pancakes, home fries and eggs all at the same time and it was a snap to clean up. It is a little big to store in my cabinets, but I have a closet right off my kitchen so it gets stored in there."
4,Almost Perfect,"This Calphalon Nonstick 13X20 rectangular griddle is very good. It is large enough to cover 2 burners on our commercial gas range. It is thick enough for even heating. The nonstick surface is very slippery; nothing sticks, even cooking residue just wipes off. You only need oil/cooking spray/butter for the foods that require browning. The only flaw is the large grease channel. With it, actual cooking surface is only 10.25""X 17.75"" Without it , the cooking surface would be truly large at 12""X19.5""."
3,Calphalon Nonstick 13 by 20 griddle,Works well but leaves discoloration on stove top that has to be cleaned off after use
3,product is OK but made in China,"Price is one thing. Quality is OK, but this product is made in China unlike many of my other Calphalon pieces that are made in the US. You get what you pay for."
3,Everlast with His new EP,"This isn't the best EP but it's still cool... Everlast's EP (Today) gives you a WEAK remix of ""Today (Watch Me Shine)"", That awesome song ""Put Your Lights On"" with Santana, The pretty cool live version of ""What it's Like"", a live version of ""Jump around"" but it's not the best version of Jump Around. (It's not a song that can make you jump unlike the original one) And the last song is ""Blues For x-mas"" which is a pretty stupid song but some people like it... All in all this is an ""okay"" EP. If your a Big Everlast fan, get this EP!"
1,EXCELLENT,THIS ALBUM IS EXCELLENT. EVERYONE WHO HAS HEARD MY COPY SEEMS TO FALL IN LOVE WITH IT. MY AUNT HAS BEEN TRYING TO FIND A COPY FOR OVER A YEAR NOW WITH NO LUCK. IF ANYONE KNOWS OF WHERE THERE IS ONE POST IT FOR ME SO I CAN HAVE THE CHANCE TO SURPRISE HER WITH HER VERY OWN COPY. HOPEFULLY FOR CHRISTMAS. THANK YOU
2,NOT Terracotta,"After receiving this item, I was surprised to see that it is NOT made from terracotta which was the whole point of buying it. It is actually white stoneware or ceramic material with an orange glaze. So , not what I expected. I also noticed the box had two layers of tape, like it was a return by someone else. The item was unused and brand new, so being a return didn't bother me, but I wondered why the first buyer returned it?The design is nice, being more useful than a beer can holder, since it has the tray and handles. It is large enough to cook a large chicken and maybe a duck or small turkey.In summary, this is a better design than most chicken roasters and usfull, but not what I expected."
1,No Instructions,The roaster did not include instructions on how to use the product nor could I find instructions on the Web. Very disappointed in the service.
2,Best to buy one pan at a time.,"I purchased a pair of 1/4 sheet pans with lids. One pan arrived in pristine condition, the other had minor surface damage to both pan and lid, perhaps as a result of rough handling. I don't think the pans were damaged in transit as they were well packaged. The Nordic Ware pure aluminum pan itself is very nice and the lid fits well. In future, I would buy Nordic Ware one pan at a time."
5,Best sheet pan I've ever owned!,"Wow, what a great sheet pan! Better quality than I've found in any retail store and even better than our local restaurant supply store. Very thick & sturdy, I don't expect this one to ever do the twist-corner-warp like a cheaper sheet pan does when placed into a hot oven. We use this quarter sheet pan every day for broiling english muffins and it has held up extremely well to that intense heat. After months of usage, the pan still looks brand new and it doesn't have any of the gooey sticky spots that are common with non-stick coated pans. We haven't used the lid yet but it is extremely high quality as well and fits very securely on the pan.We love this product and will immediately turn to Nordic Ware the next time we need another sheet pan. Highly recommended!"
2,Painfully obvious plot progression,"This book continues the over-the-top characterization of the first installment, as well as the obvious plotting. The author seemed to go out of his way to make sure readers would know where the plot was headed -- one sledgehammer-like hint was seldom enough. The two dominant 'religions' are set-up to fail, paving the way for the irrelevant broadcasts of Sedi propaganda. The journal entries he throws in are somewhat interesting looks into their representative characters, but are obviously designed to be such. They are not believable as journal entries, though. The only reason this book got two stars instead of one is the interesting way the author accomplishes what he so artlessly telegraphs."
4,Brown Heels,"I was really impressed with the black and red opened toe version of this shoe, however - when I received this shoe for winter wear - It was very snug because of the high heel pushing your toes against the front of the shoe. However I cannot bear to give them away because I still like the look. Perhaps if I got a 1/2 a size larger it would have been easier on my feet. Maybe with the closed shoe I can look for the same shoe 1/2 size larger or 1/2 inch off of the heel size to take away from the pressure. Still love them though."
5,Williams raises eyebrows,"My son, who is a voracious reader, refers to Rowan Williams as ""An Hairy Man"" (thank you, Alan Bennett). But beard and eyebrows notwithstanding there is nothing hairy about + Rowan Cantuar's thinking. Complex, perhaps, but the field of human endeavour over which his mind ranges is vast, and this ""introduction"", now supplemented by the author's more recent ""Rowan's Rule"" gives valuable insights into the mind of a clear-thinking theologian who is doing his best to keep the hallowed traditions of Christianity and the fresh thought of our often turbulent times in creative tension.Readers who want to chart the consistencies and the developments of Williams' writings have been well served by Rupert Shortt's informed and informative volumes."
5,Comprehensive,"This book presents a comprehensive portrait of the lives of women in Sung China (960-1279 AD). The author explores such topics as marriage, dowries, rites and celebrations, women's work, husband-wife relations, motherhood, widowhood, concubines, and match-making. Because of the need to rely on written materials for much of the information, and because literacy was restricted mainly to the educated and upper classes, the book naturally contains many more details about the lives of rich women than of the poor. Nevertheless, Ebrey was still able to distill some information about peasant women and families as well. The book will appeal to anyone interested in women's studies, Chinese history, or Asian area studies."
5,An Abslutely Exquisite Romance,"Wow...what can I say for this book? I picked it up on a whim at K-Mart and it has gone on to become my favorite book of all time. As another reviewer said, I didn't know it was possible to fall in love with a fictional character...my, my Trevor Fier is quite a character indeed.Not to be too much of a reviewer, I must say the romance in this book is absolutely and utterly sublime. There is such a fire between Eleanor and Trevor that I had to read scenes again and again, just out of sheer love for the romance of this book. You couldn't ask more for to sweep you off your feet--a dashing vampire with ""midnight hair that touched his shoulders."" This I honor above all romance. Kudos to you RL for creating such a flawless and passionate romance between two wonderful characters...though the ending is horrid in context, it is none the more appropriate and exquisite."
5,A Wonderful Book- A Review By Mary Sanders,"This fear street book is sooooooo romantic! I love the fear street sagas and this particular book One Last Kiss, took me forever to find since it's out of print and I finally got it on ebay. So anyway, this book is about a young girl named Eleanor, her mother was killed by vampires and ever since her father became obessed with killing vampires, and he and Eleanor moved quite a bit to escape from them. Then they moved back to Virginia, and her father get's killed by vampires as well. Eleanor moves in with a man her father knew-Trevor Fier-and his cousin Priscilla Fier. Eleanor and Trevor end up falling in love, but of course cannot marry for Trevor-is a VAMPIRE. Then in the end of the book Eleanor discover's her mother to be Queen of the vampires-and took the name of Priscilla Fier. Read this book it was wonderful!"
4,Good for Adventure-Seekers,"This book was easy to read. The plot was simple, but full of action, which made it really fun! It was slightly predictable, but Trevor was very romantic and he made up for all the flaws! ;) I loved the ending, it was sad but it was sweet. It was freedom at last. I loved the fact R.L. Stine was quick and to the point with his writing! I think the main character, the girl, should have been given a bit more depth, but overall the characters were very well done (especially Trevor.) Ok! I loved trevor AND this book!"
3,Take a look at this book,"This book was definately made for young teenagers and if you are not one, then you won't be able to read more than a page of this book. Otherwise, it is an interesting book. Nothing special, but it wasn't bad either. The only problem is that it is your basic love story that everyone has read a million times! The only thing I would suggest to change this book would be to change certain parts of the story. The plot was interesting, so if you have any thinking about reading this book, you might as well. It is short and doesn't take too much time to read."
4,vampires existing?? Oookay!!!,"I think this was a pretty good book,but the only problem i saw was that it was kind of easy to figure out what was up with Trevor. i mean,come on, the guy only saw Eleanor at night,wouldn't eat human food, and seemed to know EVERYTHING about the myths of vampires.i figured out what was going on in the begining of the book. I didnt understand the part about Annie either, did that really have to be put in the book? the girl was a vampire, but yet, she still attended Eleanor's father's funeral during the day. it just didn't go with the rest of the books vampire myths. The ending was the best though."
3,oh my gish,ok i dont want to give anything away but this book was sort of cleche. the little victom girl and the big strong male that comes to save the day. R.L stein needs some new material.but other than that it was good.i would recomend R.L steins SENIORS books too.
3,Me First And The Gimme-Gimmes,"There are 18 tracks on this compilation. Tracks include ""Do, Da, Da"" by Green Day, ""Nervous Breakdown"" by Pennywise, and ""Don't Bother Me"" by Bad Brains. But the main reason to buy this cd is the fact that Me First And The Gimme-Gimmes do their version of Neil Diamond's ""Coming To America"". You can only get that track on this compilation!"
5,Beautiful,"The freshwater pearls and the aventurine are so beautiful together. I will be keeping my eyes out for more jewelery in this combination. I like the stretch chip bracelets and found this one to have enough stretch that I can easily get it on or off. Really, just too beautiful for the price they are selling it for. For those into gemstone lore - aventurine is a good career stone for those in stressful situations at work and acts as a shield against ""energy vampires"" who like to tap in and use the energy of other people. It also reinforces ones decision making abilities and amplifies leadership qualities."
3,The sound is terrible,"They did not have to worry in making a good quality.It is not the quality of the group, but the sound quality. It's too bad."
4,Stump the Prof.,"This is a great book, kind of cheezy but it will really help you to answer some questions that you might have, and will help you to find out some good questions that you would have never thought of before. You really should get it, it will help you be more aware of what the Bible really says."
2,Not worth the money,Josh Groban - 'February Song' - I guess I'm naive but I thought this was an album and not a single song. For $9 dollars plus - it's a ripoff
1,Needs editing. Rough draft quality. Painfull to read.,"This book needs editing. Much more akin to a first rough draft than a finished version ready for print. Painfull to read, it definetely does not live up to the high standards of other O'REILLY books I've read. The book covers a lot of information in a condensed format but unfortunetly has the following shortcomings (listed in order of seriousness):1) the author often uses very poor sentence structure making absorbing the information difficult. I found myself editing the book so that the meaning would be clearer.2) many of the screenshots in the book are illegible. There are techniques and tricks for making screenshots high enough quality for print. The screenshots in the book are low quality.3) the author on occasion uses terms & acronyms before defining them. Sometimes they are not defined."
3,Oldie but Goodie,I've used this book as a syntax reference for years. That being said it is in dire need of an upgrade. It covers very well Domino up to R5 but come on we're at 8.5. An update published by O'Reilly would be a welcome item.
3,too small,These are sized more for boys than men. The quality is good though and I was able to return them without a problem. If you need boys underwear these would be great but don't buy them for men.
1,Bait and switch!,"The picture and description on Amazon.com wasn't anything like what I received. I was very disappointed, especially for the time I waited for it's arrival. I learned my lesson well, DON'T SHOP HERE AGAIN!"
1,Just buy the regular speed card,I tried unsuccessfully to buy this memory card for my camera. The 2 sellers I bought from just sent me the regular speed card that should be about $10.00 cheaper. Since I never recieved the correct card I couldn't tell you how it works.
1,disappointing speakers,"I bought these speakers based on my friends recommendation. He doesn't own a set, but he said he heard good things about them. Obviously he mis-heard something. These speakers are horrible. I've never owned a set of speakers that made such a loud, annoying hissing, humming sound when it's on, but no sound is playing. Even when you put it in standby mode using the GMX controller, you can still hear the hissing sound. It's true that you can't be in the same room as these speakers and not be annoyed by the sound. You'll be definitely annoyed when you're working on a text file and all you want is silence but you can't stop hearing the hissing sound. I would not recommend these speakers to anyone. Even though I bought them for $99, i still think it wasn't worth it."
4,Klipsch and Klipsch,"My primary home theater speakers (LF, C, LR and SW) are all Klipsch products. They performed so well, I went nuts when I heard the GMX D-5.1 DCS. I may not have the ear of an audiophile, but I can hear the difference between the accurate sound reproduction of the GMX D-5.1 DCS and do-do. Their digital reproduction is great. Connection to my SB Audigy was a trip when I used the digital signal outputs with an analog source! Turn it down!!! I'd given a Five Star but the somewhat confusing setup process and a limited speaker output configuration are downers. But don't get me wrong, a Klipsch speaker has no equal!"
2,Adequate at low power,"This system does an adequate, but not great, job of decoding digital S/PDIF audio with volume adjust for center, surround, and subwoofer. It has several simple digital decode modes.A fair value for $100, but if I had to do it again, I would prefer a lower end home theatre receiver with speakers, which often start around $150. These speakers show significant distortion at fairly modest volume levels. However, they are adequate sound for my small home office at lower volumes."
2,Limited inputs make for bad computer choice,"The limited inputs for this speaker set means that any computer user with a Creative sound card (and that's most of us) is going to be stuck listening to stereo output. In which case your 5.1 just became a 2.1.Claiming these to be computer speakers is nothing short of irresponsible. These speakers are fine for the console market, or digital connectivity to certain TVs and DVD players via coax or optic cabling. But judged as computer speakers they are an enormous disappointment."
1,I wouldn't do it again!,"I bought these direct from Klipsch, which I always thought was a good name. Not any more! The control saucer was defective on arrival and now after $350 I have to wait for them to send me a fedex slip, ship it back, and wait for them to ship me another! I am not at all pleased, and I really do not think much of Klipsh at this point. For all I know I'll get the saucer and something else will turn out defective! This speaks volumes about quality control at Klipsch! I also went to their forum and read about other people's problems with this setup, and now I'm pretty bummed about having bought them. Word to the wise, DON'T DO IT!"
4,"Good for games, not a substitute for real home theater.","Had the system for a week now. For a gaming system it sounds pretty good, but for music and DVD soundtracks it doesn't bowl me over. Can't say why, it just is not as impressive as I would expect. Lack of dynamic response and low frequency reproduction are to blame.One of the reasons could be the subwoofer. The sub will not play very low notes. Here is a test you can try on your system to confirm. Get a copy of the Beatles ""Abbey Road"" and put on the second track, ""Something"" by George Harrison. Listen to McCartney's bass 58 seconds into the song, he plays a low ""e"" on his bass which is 41.2Hz. This system doesn't not play the fundamental, just the overtone an octave up at 82.4Hz.Now, this lack of ultra-low frequency reproduction is not uncommon, but my JVC mini-system totally nails this song. Good bass reproduction is critical, and there is not enough in the Klipsch to be satisfying for music."
1,Avoid at all costs!,"I just bought a pair of these speakers and I have to warn everyone to avoid them at all costs. They produce an unbelievable hiss, even when turned all the way down (the hiss is louder than my entire computer). I contacted Klipsch support and they acknowledged that there were known quality control issues with them and that's why they don't make them anymore. I'm still waiting to find out if they'll even replace them. In the meantime, I'm going to contact Amazon about returning them, even if I have to take a considerable hit for restocking an opened item. These things are terrible at the low price of $100. I can't even begin to imagine paying $300 for them."
3,Unique design - But terrible Hiss!!,"I thought these speakers were a unique design, and when I saw that they were made by Klipsch, I didn't think I could go wrong. So, I got them to go with my new Apple G5 (using a fiber optic digital cable) but I've been disappointed. There is a hiss or white noise that is very evident whenever the sound comes on. It's not so noticeable when watching a movie, but it's very annoying when listening to music. I wish I had bought the Logitech."
1,Snake-like Hiss,"I paid $99 for this system, and it was still too much. It's a handsome system with good bass and generally good sound reproduction. The system, however, has a terrible HISS. All systems produce background noise, but with the GMX, it's more hiss than not. Even on mute, you can't be in the same room & not be annoyed by it. For a gamer system, go with Logitech (you'll get even more boom for the buck). For music reproduction, try the Harman Kardon Soundsticks. You'll be glad you did."
3,Hard to watch,As a big David Janssen fan I was looking forward to seeing something new and fresh even before The Fugitive came out.The quality of this DVD is very poor and makes it hard to watch.Someone should take this entire series and digitally remaster it!
3,Alright...,"It instantly dries your nails but makes them chip like so fast. this product is okay, not really the best."
5,"fast drying, shiny","This stuff is AMAZING - it dries incredibly quickly and leaves your nails shiny and chip-free for days. It really is quick-dry, your polish color will be set within a minute."
5,Great product & buy!,"This top coat does dry extremely fast. After 4 days my polish is still on & looking pretty good, considering I have an active lifestyle with a career and kids."
1,"Terrible -- Creates the dreaded ""peeling"" effect!","I don't know why the reviews ares so great with this product. It does a good job of drying quickly...BUT this top coat has the dreaded ""peeling"" effect in that a day or two later some nail polish will just ""peel off""! This happens especially after showering - SOOOO annoying! I will not be purchasing this again. It IS effective in drying your nails quickly, but it's kind of pointless considering it makes the polish PEEL OFF pretty soon after. It doesn't just chip off ""a little"" - the freakin' entire nail polish bed just comes off entirely. :( I've used this product 4-5 times and always have the same result. I use a base coat + two coats of QUALITY polish (OPI, Essie, etc) and still the same problem.Any suggestions for a better quick-dry top coat? Would be MUCH appreciated!!-Crystalashcraftcrystal@yahoo.com"
2,Not for chip resistance,"I paint and decorate my nails a couple of times a week. I love nail art! Although this top coat dries very fast my nails still start chipping the next day. I always file the edges of my nails, buff them, scrub them and use nail polish remover before I begin painting. This top coat does not keep polish on. If you only want to spiff up your nails for a night out and are in a rush for drying time I would recommend it. For long lasting polish I wouldn't. It sometimes leaves a whitish bubbly appearance as well which is frustrating to have when you spend so much time carefully painting and decorating. I am going to try a sticky base coat soon and am hoping this helps with this problem of chipping polish the next day after painting. Hope it helps because this product doesn't."
5,I have used this for years and I take it to the nail salon with me,"I have used this product for years. I have learned that if I apply a thick coat of the polish (a blob, really) it seems to set up faster. I apply it before my color coat is completely dry.I see some say it causes peeling, or does not dry in 30 seconds. I have not had issues with peeling, but I do note it only dries to the touch in 30 seconds. However, I have painted my nails, waited 15 minutes, and then done housework without a smudge or mishap.With this product, I can change my nail polish at night while watching TV, then wake up in the morning without sheet-prints on my fresh polish.I take it to the nail salon when I get pedicures because it dries so much faster than the top coats at the salon. The nail techs seem to like it, too."
4,Decent Eye Cream,"This product was shipped super fast and came just as described. I definitely think this is a great eye cream for the price. There are better eye creams out there, but this one is good for the months that you can't afford your HG cream."
5,Neutrogena Healthy Skin Eye Cream review,You only need a small amount to do the job. I love the squeeze tube (instead of a hard container) because you can squeeze every last bit out and there is less waste.
5,Good products,"I always like Neutrogena products. Though I haven't started yet, I have the confidence that it will deliver its usual excellence."
1,Not for dark under eye circles,This product is not for dark under eye circle as indicated online. The box nor the tube indicates it is for dark under eye circles. That is the only reason why i bought the product. Will not purchase again.
3,Stick with Olay Regenerist,"For several years I have been using the Olay Regenerist Eye Lifting Serum. When I last ran out, I decided to try the Neutrogena eye cream because I usually love Neutrogena products, and it was a better price than the Olay. I have found this cream is not nearly as hydrating as the Olay and I have to apply 2 layers (morning and night - so 4 applications throughout the day). Even still, midway through the day my undereye area is visibly dry. In addition, the white cream is hard to blend in all the way unless you use a really small amount and feels like it is sitting on the surface of your skin instead of penetrating it. It may just be that I have especially dry skin which is why I still gave it 3 stars, but now I know the Olay is worth the money."
5,The eyes have it!,"Most eye creams bother my eyes and irritate the skin around my eyes. I was a little hesitant to try this because of the alpha-hydroxy in it, but it goes on easy and leaves the delicate skin around the eye smooth and silky. Not at all irritating for me, and that's a first. I don't think the price can be beat either, especially for an eye cream."
2,"Nice price, not so nice results","This shipped quick, just like we all like. This moisturizes, but not as effectively as other brands I've used so I won't use this one again. Maybe at a younger age this would have worked better for me, but at 41, not so effective."
2,"For A Younger, Less Experienced Audience","I bought this book hoping to get detailed, in depth information about many of the more famous serial killers as well as information on the different types of killer's profiles. I bought the wrong book. After reading this book cover to cover, however, I can say I was entertained and did learn some interesting facts.The book never really gets that in-depth in to WHY these people comit the crimes they comitted. It is also a little too light-hearted in places in dealing with a distasteful topic. I would have preferred a much more respectful approach to the topic.This book IS entertaining as a light read on an airplane or something like that, but there are other books on this subject that would be vastly more interesting to the discerning reader looking to learn something about serial killers."
2,Close to total loss,"A very disappointing ""junk"" book from an otherwise worthy author, Schechter. The rather pointless organization (alphabetical, but with catch-all headings like ""duos"" and ""triad"") means that every ""fact"" is repeated about 12 - 14 times throughout the already mercilessly padded book, and every repeat is in almost exactly the same words. The only serial killers getting significant writeups are the handful that Schechter had already devoted full length books to at the time this work was assembled (can you spell ""no additional research""? I knew you could). In short, this is a near-total waste of money and paper."
4,Good interesting book,"i must say that this book did in fact open my eyes to the serial killer world. it had alot of very graphic details on the victims and how they turned into victims. the only thing i didnt realy like about this book was that the author repeats himself throught the book on a continual basis, just re-worded. other than that a great book. i couldnt put it down."
4,This is BASELINE Serial Killer information- Start with this,"one or Hunting Humans by Newton. If you enjoy (Non-Fiction) Serial Killer books start with this baseline information and from there you can research your interests. It was all well worth the reading(..except the Cunanan appendix, my opinion)Schechter does a lot of research for his books and you will not be let down. This book should be in your top 20 SK books."
1,The A-Z Encyclopedia of Serial Killers,"This is a horrible book. Its content is at best, fabricated. I will send it back. I do NOT suggest it. It gives an alphabetical list of killers that are embellished accounts of the crimes."
1,Not at all what I was looking for,"I have done extensive research in the field, and found this book to be misleading, very much so. It details that are biast. This book seems to be directed towards people who are more interested in getting a bloodfix, rather than people looking for the facts. Unless you are looking for a cheap thrill, i would NOT reccomend this book to anyone, especially if they are pursuing a career in this, or a similar, field."
3,Too repetitive at Times,"The A-Z encyclopedia of Serial Killers is an interesting book for someone who is not familiarize or has not really read in depth about serial killers. The book has interesting entries about bluebeards,black widows, and has information of serial murders of different countries that perhaps many of the readers are not familiarize with however, there are times that it becomes repetitive in its information. But overall it is a good book to read."
4,Full of Interesting Facts,"If you've ever been fascinated by serial killers, this is a book I highly recommend.It's not a book that I'd sit down and read all at once, but it's good to flip through and read the short bios and all things related to serial killers."
3,Good For Newbies,"This is a light-hearted introduction to the dark world of serial killers - a great book to start an obsession with. Although it doesn't go into great depth on any one subject, it covers most of the bases in the serial killer world and thus provides great jumping off points for further exploration."
4,"Pretty good, as long as you take it for what it is...","This book is a wealth of information concerning the history of documented serial killings and killers. However, most of the entries in this macarbe encyclopedia are trivial bits and pieces related to the crime scene, or at times, the modus operandi of the killer. Any real detail or psychological evaluations are not provided in this work, but overall an interesting read."
4,A highly entertaining book.,"Should have been longer and given more details, but it provided a lot of really cool information. There are a lot of sick weirdos out there. Does that make me one, because I want to read more of this author's work?"
5,Excellent reading for the Serial Killer buff!,"Schechter did a magnificant job describing in awesome detail the heinous murders of some of the great killers of all time. He often put one killer in several different categories. This allowed a refresher of the killers tendencies as well as show how one killer can be categorized in several different ways. The section ""Who was Jack the Ripper"" was tremendous, never have I seen a breakdown of possibilities on the most compelling case of all time. The illustrations also added a nice touch to the book. They allow the reader to become a bit more personal with the killer. The only downfall of the book was the overload of less publicized cases. Frequently, Schechter would throw in name after name of killers who fit into a particular category, many of these just became words and were lost in the mix of all the greats like Bundy and Gein. Overall, it was entertaining as well as informative. I highly recomend it to anyone interested in Serial Killers."
2,Can't tell fact from fiction...,"They play this book off as a fact based novel on serial killers and the history there of. Don't be mistaken, this book nothing short of a joke. It uses words where the author seems to be inferring, it is lacking fact. I had trouble telling what was a fact and what was heresay. Wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. Very disappointed. This was a whole different kind of novel from Schechter."
4,Great alternative to an ear thermometer,"I love this item because it is an inexpensive alternative to the ear and temporal thermometers. The hospital provided the best under-the-arm thermometer and that worked fine until my child was too mobile. I purchased an ear thermometer, which I love because it is quick, but my child was afraid of it because of the red ""ready"" light that comes on. So this was great because my daughter just felt she was sucking on another pacifier. You'll want to check it against what your doctor uses to know that you're getting an accurate reading. Take it with you to the hospitable so you'll know if it reads the same as the temporal, or if you need to add a point."
1,Piece of JUNK!!!,"This thing does not work well at all. The child has to suck on it just right to register a temperature, and it takes about 5 minutes to finish measuring a temp. Get a 1 second ear thermometer instead! Also, you can't replace the batteries. It says once the batteries go to throw it out. Crazy."
2,Not for small babies,The nipple on the pacifier is large and made my baby gag every time I tried to take her temperature. It is probably okay for babies over six months.
5,Quel plaisir de revoir Lemire,"Quel plaisir de revoir Daniel Lemire chez soi. L'humoriste le plus peau-finé du Québec nous offre enfin plusieurs extraits de son répertoire. Le son est toujours bon, les images ne sont pas toujours de première qualité (certaines sont vieilles de 20 ans), mais le plaisir n'est pas diminué. Un ""must"" pour tous les amateurs de Daniel Lemire."
4,Japanese hiphop,"Hello!I bougaht this album about six mounthes ago.I have listened world wide hiphop since 9 years, and I feel unique and power from this one."
5,"""VIP-Fleet"" White Hawk is a champion!!","...and a welcomed addition to my ""fleet"" of 1/60th Blackhawk Helicopters (though the on-line product description said it was both ""1/60th"" and ""1/72nd"" scale). It's beautifully done - the graphics are first-class. The only one I'm missing is the USAF version (having already the Army, Coast Guard, Navy, and Marine[?]/VIP-Fleet variants). To my knowledge, there's no AF version available."
4,Danaher Tool Group 10810 1/4'' Drive Extension,"The Danaher Tool Group 10810 1/4'' Drive Extension I got 2/3/12 which came in early. I thought I was getting two of them like the picture showed. A long one(6"") and a short one(2"") but I only received the longer one(6""). That is alright for I can use that one I received. I am very happy with my purchase even though I received the longer extension and not the short one that I could have used also."
4,If you love someone with autism you will relate to this book,It was refreshing to read true-to-life accounts of situations similar to what we have encountered with our 15 year old son who has autism. This is a book that you must read if you love someone who has autism. You will laugh and cry as you identify with the situations.
2,Cheap plastic bacon cooker,Egg cooker is fine but bacon cooker is cheap thin plastic. Using in a camper so luckily it will only be used a few times a year otherwise I would have sent it back.
5,Delicious,"My boyfriend introduced me to this delicious drink. We had tried another brand which didn't mix properly with milk in the microwave (I'm all about convenience!) - but this stuff tastes incredible (especially with the Cardamom & Saffron flavors - no sugar needed) - and mixes great with milk in the microwave, as well as simply stirred in a glass of cold milk. I am addicted. YUMMY!"
5,Accurate information from the source.,"I am Autistic, and I love this book. Autism is not a condition, it is a personality type. This book succeeds in making that point. This book is all about acceptance of the Autistic individual, a refreshing change from books about eradicating Autism from the face of the earth. I would also recommend ""Walden"" by Henry David Thoreau. I believe that it is another book about how an Autistic person views the world. It is of my own opinion that I think he was Asperger's Syndrome."
1,Autism as a gift,"I didn't like it because autism is pictured as a gift. As a mother I feel discouraged, it seems that all the therapies are useless to help our children to get more engaged in ""our world"". The final message is leave us alone, it's beautifull to be autistic. I would not recommend it unless the parent has given up and it's ready to stop fighting against this problem, maybe I'm not ready yet."
2,Wordy and Disappointing,I was very disappointed with this book. I found the writing style dry and the photographs/layout just not up to par. It almost seemed like somebody's thesis with som photos thrown in. Somebody needs to do a large format picture book on this subject with more about Jackie!
5,A one-night read!,"I finished this book in a single sitting. Even though the night was clear and hot, I could feel the stormy nights and overwhelming atmosphere that Piccirili created in this novel. The wind, the rain, the deep dark secrets of the past that kept everybody going back to the beach where horrors had unfolded in their childhoods...the author knew how to develop and execute (!) the story so that it completely wrapped me up in it. Demons from hell and those of the mind fill this book to bursting!"
2,"Truly a two and half, not worth avoiding not worth buying","The ""research"" on the occult issues in this book seemed more like regurgitated blurbs from encyclopedias than actual understanding of the ideas or historical figures involved. The characters were more stereotypes than rounded people, and the book dragged like a bum leg. There was nothing particularly shocking, intriguing, or thought provoking about this book. The part with the demons was really good, but it was over quickly, and it was back to the benign story that meandered forward to an even less exciting ending. This might be good for a young reader, but if you are looking for something well written and exciting, skip it. I couldn't even recommend this for a good weekend read. If you want a good horror book, try S. A. Swiniarski's ""The Flesh, the Blood, and the Fire."" Now, THAT is a good read!"
1,A total waste of time,"The glowing reviews of ""Hexes"" are either written by the author himself, or by those who have not had the pleasure of reading a truly engrossing story. When reading about the occult, one expects a wild ride of thrills, fright, evil, and the macabre. None of these attributes are found within the pages of ""Hexes.""""Hexes"" is just one long cliché after another. The development of the plot and characters are virtually non-existent. The author fails miserably to grab the readers interest. No intrigue, no suspense. So predictable is the story line that it's just pathetic to read.I was never ""shocked"" or ""frightened"" by the ""unspeakable crimes"" alleged to be found between the covers of ""Hexes."" When reading ""Hexes"" you get that familiar feeling of having ""seen"" this somewhere before, then you remember those ""B"" movies shown after midnight on your local TV station. I do believe this might be the place where the author got his inspiration for this book."
1,HO HUM HEXES,"It's rare when I don't finish a book, but this particular novel is such a waste of time and paper. Piccirilli tries to write like William Faulkner or Ernest Hemingway, with all this florid language and imagery, but fails to deliver any type of cohesiveness and unity in the plot. I don't know how it ends up, but after reading almost half of it, I couldn't take anymore. Meandering and uninvolving; I thought if he wrote ""Debbi's Dead"" one more time, I would croak.Thumbs down."
1,Did not catch my interest very well.,The story fails to develop any mystery or depth of character. I didn't even finish reading it.
1,I'll never get those hours back.,"If it wasn't for the glowing reviews others have heaped upon this book, I wouldn't have gotten past the first 50 pages. The characters, plot, and molasses-slow pace did not capture me at all, and the writing, while poetic to some, struck me as merely pretentious and turgid. _Hexes_ reminded me strongly of Anne Rice's Vampire books, which for me is not positive; consequently, it's taken me three times as long to read this as it's taken me to read books of similar size. Some books you can't put down, but this one, I hard a hard time picking back up.Lying-back-cover-blurb alert: The ""unspeakable crimes"" are absolutely UNshocking, not even deserving of an ""ew"" let alone surprise, disgust, or terror. As a matter of fact, nothing in here frightened me in the slighest.Verdict: If you are a fan of the occult, or enjoy heavily atmospheric, dramatic writing, you may enjoy this book. If you prefer more ACTION and dialogue, and less flowery language, don't bother with _Hexes_."
5,"Excellent novel, complex and disturbing.","HEXES is one of Tom Piccirilli's finest novels yet, a dark and haunting mixture of guilt, passion and redemption. In its richness and depth, HEXES is more akin to Faulkner than King."
5,"Chilling, over-the-top fiction","A solid, engaging effort with fleshed-out characters that I came to really care for. This is a haunting novel in the best sense of the word. The milieu is so offbeat and chilling that you can feel all the madness and occult weirdness building up around you as you read. A genuinely original novel with an oddball cast and a history of the supernatural that creates a profound dread. This is horror at its best."
2,Not as good as I expected.,"After all the hype about how good this book is supposed to be I was very disappointed. I have to agree with a few other reviewers that also gave this low marks. The character development was non-existant, it failed to draw me in or make me care about what happened, and it's hard to figure out what is happening until the middle of the book. Does anyone out there really know people with names like ""Jello Joe"" and ""Jelly Jane""? Give me a break! There were some scenes that I thought were well written, but overall not an enjoyable read. I forced myself through the first two-thirds, even though I wanted to quit after the first third, only because of the other reviews, but I couldn't take it any longer and gave up. On to something more worthwhile."
1,'bad attempt',"This is very confusing book, are we suppose to know all about black art and all? 'Debbie is Dead' is irritating. What is the meaninig of it? I dont know. Some secreat clue? and people use hexes as if they are firing bullets! laughable. Even kids wont be afraid. And how the main guy talk to his friend in prision without talking? were they talking telepaty kind of ? NO way, dont read this book. Is this his first horror book or? hopefully last!"
4,if you are lucky,mr.mary ivens report..all books especially on art are either appreciated or not and the reviews attest to that..in my own case i found this book to be ideal for my needs.....it provided me with many ideas and to the reviewers who did not like try reading from outside your square....i think you will find something....i say buy it .
1,only if it is free,"would I recommend this book. I am a professional artist and I find there are so many good books out there... this is not one of them. The drawings are good but not great, and certainly not great to learn by. The lessons are so, so. Each time I open and close this book, I get hardly anything at all..."
2,"Too brief, difficult to read, little insight.","I had high hopes for this book. After 45 years with Herman Miller, you would expect more than 128 pages, many of them blank or filled with terrible, random photography. The book looks like it was put together by some 14 year olds. The writing seems excessively simplistic, much of it filled with quotes or the kinds of platitudes you expect to hear before a boardroom presentation.Skip it. Save your money."
4,A Hurricane as a coverup for a murder.,"Josie Pigeon has landed a dream remodeling job. A millionaire has bought the Point House, the largest house on the island, and plans on remodeling it as a summer home for himself and his daughters. Josie and yet another new crew of carpenters have only just started to work on the building when a hurricane hits. Just before she is forcibly evacuated from the island, she sees the body of the owner, Mr. Hudson, dead in the living room. Unfortunately, the house is completely wiped out by the storm. Josie and her friends and crew, while rebuilding the island, have to solve the murder.While I wish that the construction crew would retain at least one steady member, at least Betty returns to help Josie. The locals are as eccentric as ever and the mystery is entertaining. I can't wait to read the next one."
2,Not working,The teachers and I were very disappointed with the purchase of Pinnochio. The cassette tape was warbley and we had to stop mid-way through and just finish reading the story. The kids were disappointed too.
5,The BEST!,"I own several books on pain management and physical fitness, but this little CD is the best ""book"" I have that addresses muscle/body pain and how to eliminate it. There are detailed drawings of muscles, body photos showing trigger point locations and referred pain, well organized text, and movies demonstrating the self-help technique that Ms. DeLaune teaches. If I were to own just one book on pain management, this would be it. Check it out! You won't be disappointed."
3,Good and not so good,"I love these mugs-- they are beautiful ! However, the handles are not so comfortable for holding a hot mug. I use them because they are so pretty but I am disappointed."
5,Great book for 6th grade+,"This has been one of my all-time favorite books ever since I read it last year. The plot, though confusing, has just the right amount of twists and turns to keep you interested.One thing I especially enjoyed was the fact that no one was pure good or pure evil, and very few people end up with the same character Kira percieves them with in the beginning. An example is Aunt Memory. At the beginning of the book, she is percieved by Kira as strange but welcome. A little while later, Kira begins to have second thoughts. Then, she thinks of her as kind, then evil, then, surprisingly, with a hint of sympathy.This is an overall very good book which I would recommend to anyone 6th grade and up looking for a great book you can really get lost in."
2,A bit disappointing and rushed,"I was expecting the book to start at a sleepover where a bunch of girls are getting each other to tell secrets, and one girl with a traumatic past starts spilling too much. Don't get me wrong, now. I don't dislike the book because it was not what I thought it would be.Instead, it was a sleepover. Two or Kira's friends were hypnotizing her, and what they got out of her is unrealistic. The rest of the book seems incredibly rushed. Suddenly, coincidentally, her mother is missing, some random woman shows up and Kira willingly goes with her. It just feels so, so rushed. Also, a big unrealistic. Okay, the ancient city with all this memory stuff - that's the book. But Kira's best friend, guess what, sneaked into her suitcase so she's coming along for the party too!I don't know if it's just the Kindle version, but I saw many grammatical mistakes in quotations."
1,this book is BAD,"First off, this book did not have a very brave heroine. She always needs her best friend's help for everything and evern her friend does not know what to do. Whenever they get into trouble, something really unexpected happens out of nowhere that doesnt make any sense that saves them. Kira and Lynne (who has nothing to do with Kira's past and really has no purpose in the story) are very vaguely described and do not have very solid personalities. I still do not know what happened at the end because it made absolutely no sense and is very confusing and mixed up. This book was boring and I feel as if I sleepwalked through it. This is the only book I've ever read that made me want to destroy it. do not read this book. its horrible. haddix really needs to give up writing."
4,Escape From Memory,"I believe this book, for a story in the fantasy genre, was actually pretty interesting. It was good because Kira, the main character, is hypnotized and discovers things from her past that she doesn't understand. For instance, while she is hypnotized she says things that didn't even happen to her.I believe that Haddix does a good job of portraying the adventures of a teenager as she discovers her past, and gets ready for whats yet to come. I checked this book out of my school library, and I recommend that others do the same."
5,next stop,I am attempting to find out if ths CD is produced by Delancey Street records. if anyone knows please email me and add a brief description. please thank you.
1,worst. movie. ever.,"seriously, this movie is bad. I like scary stuff, and animated stuff, so I thought I'd like this movie. and I was very, very wrong. the episodes in the movie aren't scary at all. they aren't funny, either. they're just really stupid. not 'funny jackassery' stupid, but 'why the hell did I pay money for this' stupid. I mean, the movie tries real hard to be scary, and make you think, and make you get all freaked out, but it fails horribly at all three things. it just left me kicking myself for buying this horrible, horrible movie."
4,Great scandinavian cooking,"I particularly enjoy this scandinavian cookbook as there is an even spread of recipes with obtainable ingredients. So often scandinavian cookboks are tilted towards more seafood recipes or recipes with things like cloudberries and so on which are impossible to get.This book probably has more meat dishes than seafood dishes which really appealed to me. All the recipes in this book are quite simple meaning you can make a full course scandinavian meal quite easily. Some of my favourite recipes include pork with apples, stuffed potato dumplings, ollebrod and cake from jamtland. Overall an easy book, lots of colourful photos of completed dishes and I would highly recommend."
3,casual reading only,"The book contains a few good illustrations, but as a source of reference material it is sorely lacking. The author describes only a small number of fairies and he has the habit of jumping to conclusions that depart from traditional fairy lore."
5,A Wonderful Little Book!,"I first discovered this book in Gleann Cholm Cille, County Donegal, Ireland. I thought it was great, but it was the beginning of a month-long trip, so I decided not to get it. It became one of the souvenirs I regretted not getting, so I was ecstatic when I found it on Amazon! I happen to love Irish folklore and the Good People, and found the drawings and information to be highly entertaining! It would make a great gift for kids, but as for my copy, I don't plan on parting with it any time soon! If you like fairy/faerie art work and info that isn't corrupted into being annoyingly kid-friendly, I'd recommend Brian Froud'sFaeries (25th Anniversary Edition)."
4,Very tasty,"Moist, delicious with a delectable rum flavor. It was a bit on the very sweet side, but overall a memorable dessert experience."
2,Meh.,"Honestly, I've made better rum cake with a yellow cake from a box, rum flavoring, and butter-rum sauce. Save your money and pass this one up."
3,Almost there!,Nice rum flavor. Texture of cake itself could be improved. A little mushy for my tastes.
5,The best rum cakes ever!,"I bought these cakes in the Bahamas and enjoyed them so much I had to buy more from Amazon. These are moist, you can taste the rum and you can't just eat one piece. These are the best ever!"
5,Outstanding,I first had this in The Caymen Islands. I am pleased to say same quality & freshness as if you bought it there. This is strictly on the 33oz purchased through Amazon. The best rum cake you will find anywhere!
3,Pretty good....... BUT,"I was given one of these delicious cakes as a gift from my parents for babysitting their dogs while they went on vacation.I was so impressed that I ordered one of my own.I must say that the price was good, the free shipping was excellent, but the cake was a bit of a letdown.It just didn't taste as good as the smaller version I got from my parents.Maybe next time, I'll try the mini cakes instead of the 33 ounce."
5,Like a taste of the islands,"We have enjoyed the Tortuga Caibbean rum cakes since the 1980's when they were only available in the islands. What a treat to be able to order these delicious cakes from amazon.com for our own use and gifts. Would highly recommend them to others. We prefer the original, but the coconut and lime are great also!"
3,Not As Good As I Remember,"I got one of these cakes when I was in the Cayman Islands and it was the best thing. I think I also had one in the Bahamas and it was also terrific. I don't know if it was the island atmosphere or perhaps the cakes were just fresher, but the one I ordered, while decent enough, tasted a little artificial, kind of like the plastic it was wrapped up in. I still enjoyed it, but it just didn't have that same flavor I remember. Maybe next time I'm in the Carribean I'll try it again and find out, but as for ordering online, I don't feel like it's the same."
3,Where;s the RUM?,"although the cake was moist and frseh and had a nice taste,i found it fell very short on what i was looking for...RUM flavor!try the downey cakes they have a bite to them with an overall richer flavor. theres really nothing wrong with this cake,If you dont mind paying 30 dollars for a good pound cake."
4,Does What it Claims but Hard to Use,"This product matches the original paint job pretty well, but there will always be small differences. The product works but it is very hard to apply it properly. You have to figure out a way to sand tiny areas without scraping off too much paint from the surrounding area. I found super gluing 2000 grit sand paper to the eraser end of a pencil to be a great way to get at tiny knicks. Actually applying the paint is challenging too. There is no real easy way to fix knicks and dings but this works decent at least.."
4,Lincoln's Favorite,My son loves the Cat in the Hat. He brings this toy everywhere with him. It has held up pretty well and makes a good pillow for his little head when we're in the car.
1,Horrible Toy,"This doll can't hold its head up, it is poorly made and depressing to look at. It can't be fixed. For what could have been a happy character, my child will need to use both hands to hold up his head just trying to look him in the eyes. Awful product."
1,Never got it,"I give it a one star because I never got my purchase. I was very desappointed. My grandson was left without his Cat in the Hat plush animal. Well, not really since I when to another store and bought it for him."
5,love it,My son loves the cat in the hat and soft blankets. This is a mix of both. Can't wait to give it to him for Christmas
4,good sounding i guitar for the price!,"I bought this guitar two reasons,it was at a price i could afford ,and i already had an iaxe393 .which with thin wall's of my apartment i had the landlord tell me keep it the noise down.i like the noise my iaxe393 made but don't really want to get kicked out of the rent. even with only 8watt practice amp i get complaint's ,and the police went to the apartment up the street when a neighbor was jamming on his electric guitar so i bought the behringer acoustic in the hopes that i can practice without annoying anyone .so far so good,no complaint's .if you buy the behringer iaxe393 don't twist the wammy in to hard the chrome will break like it did on mine and the software i did not figure how to use ,both guitars are not bad for price."
3,An excellent introduction to emerging authors,"George Mann's accessible and well-organized encyclopedia of the genre makes for a fun read and a great introduction to emerging authors. While Mann succeeds in highlighting promising new talents, he lamentably excludes many deserving ""big names."" And the section devoted to SF movies and television, while entertaining, seems ill-suited for a work concerned almost wholly with literary works. Regardless of any given reader's bickering with who Mann chooses to exlude, the ""Encyclopedia"" is a studious and helpful reference for genre addicts and curious initiates."
3,Better than John Clute Anyway,"Unlike John Clutes laboring pseudo-academic gibberish designed to appease Harold Bloom and his cronies which keeps you flipping back to the glossary as his burdensome tome clefts large cavities in your thighs this book's approach is more practical. Albeit slightly biased toward English writers. John Clute is himself Australian, however Clutes faculty club post modern fashion statement is absent and that's good for anyone who finds such trendy accents precious, vain and fatuous. If you want that read Jacques Derrida or the minutes of the Modern Language Association, that is ""serious"" literature."
4,Beautiful Bamboo,"Purchased this curtain to replace an older one that had been damaged over the years. it is beautiful and makes the most wonderful noise when the breezes blow through it! We live in SW Florida and like to leave the doors open to the breezes and this curtain gives us a nice bit of privacy while still letting in light -- and it looks super tropical and really enhances my decor. I also have another one hung over a window to block some of the harsh sun. A great-looking product and a great price, as I shopped for quite a while before buying this one."
5,My Favorite,"My sister bought me these years ago as a gift and they quickly became my very favorite baking sheets. They have gotten so much use and still look great. The lids are sturdy and strong and have traveled to every picnic or family dinner without cracking. The silpat sheets are a little large for them but you'd be hard pressed to find a bigger cookie or baking sheet with sides on it, so I cut the silpat a tiny bit. These are the baking sheets I would start my daughters off with or give as gifts because they will last forever, can't rust, are heavy aluminum and can be scrubbed without damaging them,and are a nice big size that we need when baking."
5,Very good size,The pan fits my Silpat perfectly. I baked Dorrie Greenspan's Creme Brulee in it on the Silpat with great results. I know it will be used frequently.
1,Elevator Music,This is sooooo bad it makes me laugh. The enthusiasm is gone. Just when you expect to feel a tingle up your spine from the original beat the tempo changes in the most disappointing way. One star is one too many.
1,Don't waste your money on this!,"Unfortunately, this DVD was purchased to help educate incarcerated black men about hypertension. The doctor is almost impossible to understand - he is some type of oriental with a very heavy accent/broken English and not very understandable. To top that off, the DVD was ruined about halfway through the DVD - and thus would not play all the way through. Don't waste your time, effort or money on this!"
2,Not up to snuff,"Item was truly unfinished pottery. The packaging and other details make it appear nice but it seems to be of poor quality without the finishing touches for use in any kitchen. This is not a $12 item in my opinion. I purchased a beautiful 8"" Diam. pot 12"" high with a beautiful glazed finish for $9.00. This pot is tiny with jagged unfinished edges which left a very rough and crude finished product."
4,adorable mini herb pot,"This is super cute and looks very functionable. Great for a housewarming gift or small apt window sill. About 4"" by 4"" with slots for herbs."
2,bummer,"I have a tiny apartment and the only real direct light I get is from my kitchen window. This product was great in theory, but it was awkward to assemble. nothing sprouted, either, which could be my own fault, but I wouldn't reccommend this."
3,nice but wrong item,"this was not what i ordered. however, the product i did receive came on time and in very good condition. it was still an herb garden but not the one in the picture. it was a gift and she still said she liked it."
1,Broken Herb Garden,"This item came poorly packed and (guess what) broken. But on the plus side, it was too inexpensive to worry about returning it."
1,broken pot,The pot was very thin and cheap - it was broken upon receiving the product. would not buy again.booo.
1,Waste of money,Followed all the directions. Got 3 sprouts of dill and that's it. Really deserves no star but I couldn't submit without 1.
2,Not very useful,"I like the pot but the dirt in the pellets does not fill it as shown in picture. Put the pellets inside and you cannot reach them to plant the seeds, try to start the pellets and seeds on the outside and the pellets fall apart since they do not have a mesh around them."
1,THE WORSE BUY EVER!!!!!!,The planter too tiny and seeds grow very weak. I followed all the instructions and took good care of the plants but they were so weak that couldn't stay stand. Waste of time and money.
3,Not impressed!,"I got this for my mother for her birthday. The pot is not very pretty....that is all. My mother said that she didn't care because taracota pots are supposed to look rugged but I still think it could of been nicer, well at least the price was some what fair."
4,great corporate gift,I gave these to my staff and they were well received. Finding xmas gifts for co-workers is hard. lots of office stuff out there but these were more personal and not that expensive.
4,What it lacks in maps and illustrations it makes up for in information,"While I would like to see a quick map of where I am considering hiking, it's nice to have a thorough guide for the whole state in one book."
1,"CONCUR with ""Poorly organized and executed""","This is probably one of the worst teaching CD's I have ever seen. Indeed, the author, who is also the instructor for the college course, clearly has no concept of what good programming skills or good presentation styles are . The entire course was basically copy & paste exercises with no real instruction whatsoever. There was no challenge. I could have learned just as much on my own. To add insult to injury: he gets the money for the poorly written (and required) CD. I would give it 0 stars if I could."
5,Durable and multipurpose,"I needed a pan that could hold hot water so I that I could soak my feet in it, but decided to avoid the much cheaper plastic containers (who knows what kind of crap would leach out). This pan is sturdy and, as others have pointed out, can be used for any number of things. It's a bit on the pricey side, but worth it."
3,"music lovely, cd cover not so much","This is a lovely recording, but unfortunately the cd cover arrived broken so I had to find one in which to store it.these cd's are far too expensive not to arrive in perfect condition."
3,"One ""heavy"" cd of not terribly ""uplifting"" music","There is no knocking here of Martin Pearlman and The Boston Baroque.They are top notch and their other notable recordings of works such as The Bach ""Brandenburgs"" and the Vivaldi ""Gloria"" are wonderful.This cd, though,contains very heavy and dull works that are just a little too ponderous for an enjoyable listen.After commencing with Beethoven's ""Elegiac Song"" to start us on our downward spiral,we next procced to Cherubini's ""Requiem"" and ""Marche Funbre""....and then we die!!! Whoever put this particular collection of works together I doubt had in mind the total effect of death that would result...or maybe they did.The Cherubini works are not great music.As Requiems go...ehh.I can't recommend this cd unless you are studying these works and need to hear interpretation.Avoid the HYBRID-SACD recording especially."
4,Orson Who?,"You know, in the entire ""Night America Trembled"" the words ""Orson Welles"" are never heard. I actually went back and played it through again to be sure. The character is split into two - the director and the star, and in his out-of-character sign-off is referred to only as ""your host"" (Welles names himself in the original). Now what I want to know is, was that Welles' demand of the show to remove his name, or the show's idea to exspunge his involvement (and who were they trying to kid in doing so)?Otherwise a very compelling drama. Too bad George Clooney's attempt to revive the genre (Fail Safe) didn't succeed. Now live drama is ""Big Brother"". How far we have fallen."
1,dissapointed,"we ordered two and returned both. normally, I have always been impressed by Nordic ware products and over the years have purchased a number of their products. The steak platters were much smaller then anticiapted and appeared to be poorly made."
1,Steak plate,Product lightweight. Not heavy enough to hold heat very long. Nwe were disappointed. Metal. Cannot microwave. Order other steak plates.
1,Plates turned black and disgusting almost immediately.,"My mother used these Nordic Ware steak plates for over 40 years. I grew up with them and when Mom passed away she handed them down to me. I treasured them and the memories they brought. The old plates were still fine but a little beat up so we decided to order 8 more and continue the tradition since we now have grandkids. Got them in March 2011 and by May 2011 they turned black and disgusting. They are so bad we are afraid to eat off them or serve food on them. $66 wasted and what a dissapointment! Nordic Ware had one of those amazing, great products that doesn't come along very often. So sad to see a quality product and a little piece of my past go into the dumspter because Nordic Ware cheapens up their product. Don't buy these plates!!"
2,Single serving only.,"I expected more from Nordic Ware - it should be heavier as a ""platter server"". It is just an oval single-serving plate on a plastic platter. Where did all the heavy-duty metal serving platters go? The kind you could use to keep meat warm during a BBQ or a roast out of the oven?"
4,Good freezer boxes,Very good freezer boxes. Made of the softer plastic that isn't so prone to cracking. Nice quality. Plan to buy more of these.
1,"Dies OK, Ratchet is unacceptable for the price",This set has pretty good cutting dies but the ratchet wrench will not last at all. Very poor quality. Greenlee is going downhill. Unacceptable for the price paid.
5,Great Jazz Compilation,"This is a great selection on jazz standards from some not so well known artists. It is ""comfy"" music that you can listen to while doing most anything. Annette Lowman really shines on the first track. You won't go wrong with this one."
1,Why Buy A Reprint of a Government Document,"It's bad enough to have persons without disabilities profit from their work and advocacy, but it's particularly offensive to copy to works of both Government and Ron Mace, put their name on it and call it an original work.Shame on this book..."
3,Need more Glazing,The inside is glazes up to the edge it would be nice if the handles where also glazed. The bread can take longer to cook than some recipes say because of the thickness. So I would turn down the temperature a little.
1,I CAN'T BELIEVE IT ARRIVED BROKEN..after ALL OTHER REVIEWS SAME PROBLEM,"I read the reviews about this container arriving broken. I assumed that, since there were quite a few, the company would at least recheck their packaging and/or inspect these before arriving - as returning and replacing would end up costing them.This wasn't merely ""slightly"" cracked... it arrived in pieces! The ""mini"" ones and Sassafras clay bakers I purchased were in the same shipping box... those arrived in tact, so either this product is so fragile it will easily crack after purchase (even if arrives ok), or their protective packaging is worthless. It was covered in wrap on outside, but no inside protection."
1,It arrived broken,"I was really excited with the low price and good reviews, so I ordered two. They both arrived broken to pieces, probably due to bad packaging. Save your time and money."
2,a college thesis without depth of experience,"I read this book just after returning from 12 years in Japan studying Butoh dance and Rinzai Zen.I was hoping this book would trigger my inspiration in how to articulate and explain this inexpressible art formIn a way which others can at least catch a glimpse of the transiency and beauty of Butoh.I was left disappointed because it became quite clear that words directly correlate with ones experience. Just as the great Zen Masters can write in a way that captures their clear mind. If someone only writes analytically from the point of view of an observer- than it's clear it's purely information and cannot touch the true heart of Butoh. That being said, this little book is, in a way, an homage to butoh and any/ all fingers pointing to this indefinable artform deserves a 'gassho'"
2,A little on the heavy side,"I thought that this earring would be lighter. It actually makes your earlobe droop. Nice look, but too heavy."
5,Clever design tweaks!,"Love this set. The pan -- with either bottom in place -- feels solid. It releases food without a fuss and cleans easily. Although parts fit together tightly enough to prevent leaks, it's nice to have that little bottom groove to catch anything that might slip through. This set is going to be serving me well for years to come."
5,springform pan with 2 bases,"I was replacing a similar pan that was damaged in a storage unit accident and this is just what I wanted. It can be used for bundt cakes as well as flat cakes, like cheese cakes."
3,5 minutes that changed the direction of the war.,"As author Mark Healy reports, the battle in the Pacific changed tempos at roughly 10:30 A.M. on June 5, 1942. At that time, the American dive bombers hit three of the four Japanese carriers, and basically incinerated the squadrons of Japanese aviators waiting to take off. All three carriers became a caulderon of flames, and the pride of the Japanese fleet went down. The Americans later sank the remaining carrier and a heavy cruiser. All this at the expense of one carrier (Yorktown) and a destroyer. This was a turning point of history. As Healy states, the Japanese were suffering from the disease of victory. They expected they were superior, and lost the battle.This is a nice picture book with a good summary of the battle. I especially liked the pictures of the carriers prior to the war. Two of the Japanese carriers were huge ships. A nice summary book."
1,Very Disappointing,"I bought this book with high hopes of finding an interesting and illuminating look at how Copernicus revolutionized astronomy. I was so disappointed that I did something I virtually never do: after about 90 pages, I put the book away with no intention of finishing it. Vollmann is a writer of note, but in this case his writing is so mannered and his exposition seemingly so convoluted that the reader quickly grows fatigued. At least, this reader did."
1,Lewis and Clark Great Journey West,"I am disappointed you sent me a region 1 copy when my address dictates I am in region 4, my dvd player won't allow it to play and my computer tells me I have lost one of a few chances to view this dvd or risk losing that computers ability to play dvds???? I am not happy. Regards, Col Maybury."
1,"National Geographic - Lewis & Clark - Great Journey West, by S. WILHELM.","Unfortunately, this DVD cannot be used on the French version of WINDOWS XP. More attention should be paid to compatibility between items and computer versions available in specific countries, for I am afraid I cannot use the product."
3,Needs to be longer,"I came away from viewing this video thinking it would be pretty decent for educational purposes - probably late grade school through junior high. I did learn a little, but forty minutes just is not enough time to get into a journey of that length at all. I do think they use the forty minutes worth of film well, though (speaking of information, not entertainment).If you are pretty unknowledgable about Lewis and Clark and are looking for something that will inform you on the basics of their journey, then it is worth getting."
5,WMV-HD Disc Is NOT Self Destructing,"This is in response to the_digital_dude's comments from July 1. The license will renew after it expires as long as the disc is in the drive. You can copy the WMV file to your computer and play it without the disc being in the drive as long as the license is active. After it expires, you will have to place the disc back in the drive and the license will be renewed. As far as I know, this is the way all of the Imax and National Geographic WMV-HD movies are. Unfortunately, one of the earlier WMV-HD movies, Terminator 2, required an active internet connection to acquire the license. I agree that the digital rights management is confusing to the consumer and really should be documented somewhere on the disc or packaging."
4,Lewis & Clark - Great Journey West,"The Special Edition DVD that I ordered has not yet arrived but I already have the standard edition DVD and the only difference is that the Special Edition has an extra disc with a Windows Media High Definition version of the film for use on computers with HD capability.The film of the journey is well constructed and filmed with good quality lenses and equipment so that even the DVD version has good detail and colour. The narration is by Jeff Bridges and is clear and concise. As a British viewer, I found it interesting historically because it records a journey that took place while much of the North American interior was unmapped but claimed by Britain and some other countries.Charles S. Kirk, Dec 2007"
5,National Geo - Lewis & Clark DVD,The National Geographic - Lewis and Clark - Great Journey West is a great learning DVD.
1,Not what I ordered...,"The Special Edition turned out to be the standard DVD edition not including the extra DVD with the high-def windows media version, why? Furthermore the ordinary DVD was a Region 1 even though I ordered from Europe (Sweden)...Dissappointed, YES!Regards / H Nilsson"
3,Beautiful scenery,"If you never get out to see the American west, this is lovely viewing. This was done for the enormous IMAX theaters and it is the next best thing to being there. If you want something engrossing and rich in detail, you're better off buying the Ken Burns documentary."
2,smoked up,"I have purchased books from Amazon before, but this time I really dont like the book I purchase and I would really like my money back, when I received my book, I could tell it was a chain smoker who had this book it reaked of smoke I cannot put any of my notes inside the book because it smells just like smoke and the outside of the book when you close it you can tell he or she spilled coffee along the pages.Someone should have really looked over this book before selling this piece of scrap to me."
2,Confused,"Is there any particular reason why this textbook is ""a la carte"" instead of a traditional bond book? I'm having trouble finding the bond edition within the Amazon online store. I did find the book at Pearson's but the cost is 173.00! I would have thought that Amazon could price the book much less ... without going ""loose leaf."" If I have to pay the price of a book, I would like it to be bond; loose leaf is too easy to lose or tear/damage the pages."
2,Ridiculous color,"Bought the ""dark oak"" and it's orange. It is unlike any naturally occurring wood color or normal wood stain that I have ever seen. Really, orange is the only word for it. If I hadn't started putting it together before I really focused in on the color I would have returned it. Instead, we'll drape some kind of table runner over the top and maybe see if we can put some other finish on it. It was also missing the pieces for the four little decorative flares at the top of the sides. Despite those complaints, the form is nice, the price was good, and it's pretty sturdy for flat-pack furniture. The doors, especially, are beautiful."
3,Watch the color,"Just received the unit, ordered in a light oak. Be aware that the color shown is NOT the color you will receive. The color is more like an orange, a real orange color, much like the old pine cabinets of the 50's. Doesn't look like the picture, nor any kind of ""light oak"" I've ever seen. I'm going to use it, however, I will apply a coat of stain-sealer to cover the yellow color. Assembly is straight-forward; no difficulties, no missing parts."
3,Good Content; Poor Presentation,"The stories are wonderful, but the pages were made of cheap paperand there were no illustrations. It is good for your library. butnot a book for a child to handle or to give as a gift."
4,Parables of Nature,"We have only read one of the parables and even though the language is written in a more formal style, the parable was interesting and has a lot of room for discussion about life. We look forward to reading more.Homeschool MomAmy in TN"
1,Printing Error--don't buy this!,"Chapter 12 (Daily Bread) was printed twice, and Chapter 13 is missing. None of the chapters are actually numbered anywhere--they only have the titles. This is a bad product and I wish I could return it!!!"
3,Wrap It Up!,"Liked the book, love the premise of the series, but please, Kage Baker, do not drag us through endless volumes, crawling towards some far-off conclusion that never comes (as we've seen so often in recent years with some wildly popular authors). Keep it witty, don't lose the dark humor and scathing indictment of a future where humanity is too afraid to live -- but wrap it up in the next volume, for pete's sake. Don't drag us through two or three more books to get where we need to go, as I have this sinking feeling you might be planning to do. Yes, I know there was a lot of back story to pull together (most of which was enjoyable, tho' repetitive in some cases) but blast off now in that pirate ship to a satisfying and tightly plotted ending that explains what happens in that big silence. And let Mendoza be happy. And your faithful readers will be, too."
2,No Story,"InThe Life of the World to Comethe hero attracts sex, discovers he has pre-human genes and gets involved in time travel and smuggling.This book contains a sequence of chapters in the saga that starts inIn the Garden of Iden."
1,short's blowing the crackpipe instead,"too short I know you once said you'll never stop rapping but a word of advice stop please quit trying to sound like luda, 36 mafia and ther south hook back up with shorty b, ant banks, and pee wee bring back the classic oakland funk there are plenty of p funk to use if you're out of beats hell george clinton has 1500 songs unreleased and george has always let otgher people borrow his music go to him and ask him for some tracks cause we ain't feelinmg you no more dog."
4,too short keeps the pimp status,"This album is classic Too Short. It was recorded in Atlanta, GA, and you can definitely hear it in the track production. Lil Jon and Jazzy Pha are the two main producers on this album. I wish Too Short would have expanded the list of producers, but still a very good album if you're a Too Short fan. My favorite track has to be ""Baller"" w/David Banner or ""16 Hoes"" w/Jazzy Pha and Bun B. All around great Too Short album."
2,"thin album. grimey. offensive (to be expected). shallow novelty, little else","Not a very good album. listen to these tracks online if you want, save your $$. the few good(ish) songs on this album get stale pretty quick."
4,sd local,this cd by too short i say is ok it's worthing buying if u r a too short fan.some of the songs i skiped because the beats did't intersted me at all. but some of the other songs are tight but won't get no air play because of the explict lyrics.i like number#8#9#2#4#12i say are the best songs on this ablum but overall i like the ablum when u sit down and actualy listen to the whole ablum its pretty good .
3,LIVE TV RULES!,Good black/white courtroom drama. Actors actually memorized their lines. Single camera the size of a refrigerator used to record the action. Nevertheless a good study of early television. Did anyone notice Edward Asner on the jury? Would like Netflix to put all the Studio One and Chrysler Theater live shows on their list.
3,"Good show, but a little slow...","Watching this TV courtroom drama, I realized I saw it when I was a kid--I remember bits and pieces. Nevertheless, I recently saw the Boston Legal episode, Son Of The Defender (one of BL's finest) into which the producers add various clips of The Defender, so I had to have it.The show, filmed in black and white, really wasted a lot of time in development, and if it had been condensed by half, would have held the audience's attention a bit more.The acting was top-notch, and the end was excellent, plus it made for a great, I mean truly great, Boston Legal episode, which is in the third season disc set. If you've seen The Defender, then you've got to see Son Of The Defender, or vice-versa...."
3,Beautiful but...,"This is a gorgeous pan and cake comes out easily. The BIG drawback is that because of this pan's size, cake tends to overcook on the edges before the center is done. So you end up with very dry dry edges if you want the cake fully cooked. Not so gorgeous...."
4,2nd purchase,This is the 2nd purchase for this product. The cake that I made looks beautiful and my friend like it so much and ask me to buy one for her.
5,"A Classic ""Must Read"" Investment Book","Nikki Ross has documented principal strategies and investing advice from the great Wall Street legends of our time. I have found the underlying principals of Buffet and his mentors as well as Price and Templeton to be very helpful. It is an easy to read enjoyable book. It may not be for day traders in general, but they could benefit from the list of questions asked by the masters before investing. I believe that had many investors read and applied this book prior to and during the recent crash, they might have saved a lot of money.Blake Conant"
1,"Real one is great, I got a knock off that is junk from Amazon.","The real version of this product is hard to beat, the knock off that was delivered is easy to beat, the hole for the headphones does not line up and the window for the screen is way to small so you can't see a large portion of the screen. Not an acceptable replacement at all."
3,"by greinke, samuel it serves the purpose","this is a good basic leather case. a little style with its stitching but the non-remaovable clasp in the back is a real draw back. good quality materials and construction. flip top is great for discretion.by samuel greinkegreinke, samuel"
2,A let down,"I've been a fan of this franchise since the original game came out. SANDS OF TIME was one of the most enjoyable games I've played in a long time. I've played it through several times and it never gets old.For this game, I've finished maybe 30% of the game by my estimates and I don't know if I'll continue. The developers put all their efforts into making combat more viloent and that's about it. The game is too heavily reliant upon fighting and it really takes away from the game.Skip this one and go right to the TWO THRONES. Hopefully that one will be better"
1,Prince of Persia should be an excellent platformer at heart,I agree with the earlier review. They changed prince of persia from an excellent platformer to a ninja gaiden look alike with much more fighting.
1,Do not support buggy games,"I would not reccomend this game to anyone for the simple reason that it's buggy. I could live with the voices cutting in and out or the random hits but I can't live with a game that messes up and requires you to start over from the beginning to (hopefully) not get the bug the next time through.The game itself was fairly fun. However, going through the same areas, even if they are present and past versions got really boring.Also, the fighting system doesn't always work too well. The prince has some cool new moves but there's an auto aiming system that just doesn't leave a person in control of what they are doing and frequently resulted in him jumping off a ledge or striking towards a distant enemy rather than the one in the direction I was pushing.Don't buy it."
2,Wrong Direction,I just got finished playing the demo of this game and I have to say that it feels like the developers are pandering to the 13 year old grundge beat 'em up gamers out there. What was once a charming and enthralling experience is now a Mountain Dew commercial. Worst of all- there's far more fighting- and rediculously hard bosses- so you can just forget about completing this one until the cheats come out. Why do developers do things like this?
1,this game is horrible,I'd spend my money on Ninja Gaiden anytime. Warrior Within is horrible. Don't waste your money. I am going to ebay this sucker as fast as I can.
5,The Best Xbox Game Yet,"yeah, i said it. the best xbox game yet. i've been playing it for three months and still haven't finished it. it is as deep as any game i've played and the combat is hugely improved over Sands of Time. i can't wait to see what ubisoft does next."
1,Prince of Persia: Warrior Within,"I'm not satisfied with the product at all. I owned the game once before and played it over and over because the game itself was awesome. I'm just not satisfied with this purchase because I thought that I was getting a great deal with a used game, but what I was really getting was a game that didn't even work. I feel that the game shouldn't even be allowed to be sold. I'm not happy with this game at all."
5,"Best game ever. Well, at least pretty good.","Very fun. Challenging yet beatable for a casual gamer. The puzzles are fun, the fighting is only bested by pure fighting games or later installments of the series. There is no other storyline game series with as good of combat. Sorry, every other franchise loses. Game over. Pop has better melée action."
3,Fun game until the end...,"... After investing 20+ hours into this game, I ran into a glich where the game would not progress to the last level. It occurs after you push the sand queen into the portal. After checking the web for tips I learned that the only way to correct glich was to start all over! What a piece of crap programming!"
2,Great till the end,"Game was amazing till I found out it had a bug which shows up after doing days of work and you want to fight the last boss. Makes me wish I never started it in the first place. I heard it may only happen with games purchased from companies who got cheap versions from overseas. Maybe don't buy it over the internet like I did, from here."
5,Oh My God!! This Book rocks!!!!,This book is one of the best books I've ever read! Rosie Rushton was amazing with this book!Life of a typical teenage girl like myself!!..its a MUST read and a MUST have!!
4,good not bad!,I liked this book very much. i love rosie rushto'ns books! although this wasn't one of her best it was good. If you are the kind of person that likes teen problems and and mom's bugging their kids etc then tis and all of rosie rushton's books are for you!
4,Generation Kill an excellent description of war in Iraq,"Reading Generation Kill allowed me to revisit Operation Iraqi Freedom all over again. The book allows the readers to understand exactly what its like to be a soldier. He or she must deal with the personal demons that come with having to kill in self-defense, and questioning whether or not that it is justified. I saw my own platoon and squad members in the characters in this book. Many of the situations these individuals found themselves in are the same situations I found myself in Iraq. Sometimes it brought chills up my spine when I read some of the raw details of attacks and ambushes. If you take anything from the book, its how differently people react to being in combat and how much it changes them for the better, or worse. If you want to know what its like to be in an infantry platoon during wartime, read this book."
5,2-501st. good read.,"My husband entered Iraq in June of 2003 shortly after the Marines in this book. He spent 15 months there as a Blackhawk crewchief and until I read this book I had NO idea the nightmare that he bear witness to. I would like to tell Mr. Evans how much I love his book and how much it opened my eyes to what my husband saw. He has not been able to talk about the things he saw or the things he did, much like Vietnam. It scares me, but after reading this book, I understand why he can not talk about it, why he can not remember."
2,This is No Masterpiece,"I read this book right after reading Mark Bowden's masterpiece, Black Hawk Down. As an author, there is no comparison between Bowden and Wright. Wright's attempt at documenting his Iraq experiences is amateurish at best, little more than formalizing a poorly written journal. He delights to explain in great detail what it is like to defecate in full battle gear, an indication he doesn't have much to say by way of substance. His book is filled with this type of minutiae, selectively including quote after quote from soldiers that reinforce the title of his book, Generation Kill. This book is a great disappointment if you are expecting something on the level of Black Hawk Down."
3,Elias and Barnes in Iraq,"Despite the books claim to define a generation, it is actually a loosly chronological retelling of the situations and tactics of a few platoons 'on the tip of the spear' in the recent Iraq war.The only well defined characters in the book are the leaders of the units, nicknamed Iceman and Captain America, who play off each other like a 21st century Elias and Barnes from the movie Platoon. The commanders actions often seem to place ordinary soldiers in unnecessarily dangerous situations and more that once, seem to engage in acts of atrocity. These actions generate color commentary from the ordinary soldier both in defence and in criticism of the personalities, actions, tactics, strategy and the reasons for the war itself. The book however, lacks a serious tone and most often seems to be coy and playful about the most serious subjects, and indefinitive about the truth of some allegations."
5,Great,This book was great. It was funny and poignant at the same time. I read some of the book to my mom and she could not believe what happened to these guys.
5,Brilliantly written and a great buy.,"I watched the HBO series first but knew the book would be just as capturing. Evan Wright's literature is easy to read and understand and gives a strong perspective into the war that most people will never know about. Realistic and a bit offensive at times, I loved it from page 1."
5,ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS I HAVE READ,"AMAZING BOOK, very interesting. If you have ever wondered what modern warfare is like for marines this is the book to read."
5,One of my favorite books,This is one of my favorite books. It really gives a good descrition of what Recon went through. Read this and watch the show.
4,A No-Bull Account of the War in Iraq,"Generation Kill is a great first-hand account of what's going on Iraq. As the term ""embedded journalist"" becomes more and more pervasive in the media coverage of the war, it's valuable to think about how the the war coverage has been influenced by the fact these journalists depend on the military for their survival and protection while reporting. What I admire about Evan Wright's account (and this is probably why the military has severed their ties with him) is that he doesn't allow this relationship to influence his reporting. His account doesn't come across as partisan or biased, just brutally and sometimes unfavorably honest. He conveys the complexity and confusion of war without seeming glib or relying on stereotypes about soldiers and their motivations. Generation Kill doesn't mince words, it doesn't save face, and it's the kind of book you can learn a lot from even if you don't usually take an interest in current events or the military."
4,Generation Kill,"I started out reading this book thinking it was going to be boring or biased or both. It was neither. I am not generally enthralled by war stories, but these Marines were such backwards characters and the pace of their lives in Iraq so quick, I didn't get bored. I didn't read anything too horribly biased. I am against the war, and figured the author would have their beliefs about the war affect the overall tone of the book. But the book really ended up being a straightforward account of the missions of these Marines."
3,one-sided...love/hate,"I saw Wright a few times but never spoke to him. This book is honest in that the comments are probably accurate, but he cut out the essencse of young Marines to show just their brawling, profane side. in that respect, he was intellectually dishonest and savaged the battalion. but it's a fun read. so i'm torn. Accurate events but one-sided view."
5,Excellent and Gripping,"I started reading Generation Kill half thinking I was going to put it down after a few pages, wondering if it would interest me. War books are not generally something I read, but this one came highly recommended. After about 5 pages, I realized I would not be putting this one down. Evan Wright has put together an excellent recounting of the first few months of the most recent Iraq war based on his 'embed' experience with a group of Marines. Wright is a magazine writer, so his style here is clear, concise and readable. I think this book is especially valuable for those (and that would be most of us) who have never been in the armed forces because it sheds light on why members of the military do what they do, helps it all make sense. The men whose story he tells are all complex individuals and all very human, very American. Enjoy."
5,FINALLY!,"This book was action packed, well written and allowed you to get to know every guy in the platoon. It is extremely vulgar but I'd be swearing too if I was getting shot at. I felt like I understood each character and their personality, and found myself laughing at the usual pranks, songs (South Park song)and antics that friends do to eachother. The best book I've read about Iraq yet! I plan to re-read it asap!"
4,Tragic & Uplifting,"I had not seen the HBO series or read any of the Rolling Stone articles so the book was a fresh read for me. I found it engrossing; Wright captures the ""what it as like"" feeling very well; I came away with a bitter feeling at how these young warriors' sacrifices are squandered by the Bush administration's incompetence in the overall Iraq scheme of things."
5,Unbiased perspective,This book is written so well. The reality of the propaganda we are fed sinks in.
2,This one needs a re-write badly...,"I knew this would happen. Modern American ""literature"" for 25 years has been adding unnecessary sex scenes whether they were needed or not.. So I predicted that soon ""literature"" would describe in detail the act of defecation. This book, finally, does it. But, I suppose, the author wanted to be cute - as it is obvious from the title.It is a shame. The Recon Marines, the best of the best, would have deserved a readable account; one that would have chronicled their history in a book that can be read fifty or a hundred years from now.If the book was only re-written, perhaps by a Catholic nun of conservative leanings... It needs that. The story is magnificent, and it is true, by an embedded journalist.But, as is, it is a piece of trash. I will explore if I can return it to Amazon; I don't want it in my house."
2,Not a Believer,"I'm not in the military. Never was. I am however a HUGE fan of spec ops units. My favorite unconventional warfare unit is the U.S. Navy SEALs. I've heard people say that the Marine Force Recon guys are a lot like Navy SEALs. After reading this book, I no longer believe that. The SEALs strike me as more professional. I'm not sure how much the Force Recon guys train but it can't be nearly as hard as the Navy SEALs' training. If you like reading about guys who are strichtly professional, read ""Down Range: Navy SEALs in the War on Terrorism"" by Dick Couch. It is an excellent book. When I finished that book, I felt sad because it was over and he couldn't tell all the Navy SEAL missions. When I finished Generation Kill I thought ""It's finally over"""
4,I was delighted with these authentic Italian recipes but....,"This is one of the better Italian cookbooks I have come acrossbut I ran into a problem with the first recipe I tried. The orange semolina cake sounded great. I prepared the semolina, made the ricotta mixture and beat the egg whites. The recipe never tells you what to do with the cooked semolina! I'm an experienced cook, and I figured it went into the ricotta mixture, but who knows? We're eating it tomorrow, Christmas Eve and I guess I'll find out then."
5,very cool music,"this cd is nothing short of fantastic, every track is a very listenable track from start to finish, and it makes the cd really worth the money.Cryin at te discotheque, very catchy and addictive, takes u back, way back, luv it!Almost famous also is a very catchy track and stands out as one of the cds best songs along with Paris in the Rain, the remake of Dont you Want me, Shine one me and Bellz of alcazar.the only track thats out of place is Ritmo Del Amor, although its nice, i dont think they shoulda went over the spanish side of things... still superb though! cant wait for the next release"
1,White???,"I ordered this hat expecting it to be white since that is what the description is. It is not white, it is cream colored. I cannot use it because of this reason."
4,When you don't know what to say....,"This book is loaded with spiritual passages and poems that I find very helpful when sending sympathy, birthday, congratulatory, etc. cards or messages. Sometimes I can't find my own words to express my feelings as well as Helen Steiner Rice."
1,It sucked,"Don't waste your time on this one. The animation was bad and so was the storyline. Whatever you do, do not expect Kung Fu Panda!"
1,Don't waste your time or money,"I don't know what movie the previous reviewer was watching, because this movie is so lame! The 3D graphics is nothing like Sharks Tale and doesn't even come close to Shrek. You need to be under the age of 5, to enjoy this movie. Master Panda is no master! He's like a Jester! He throws in a few jokes and farts. KG knows more kung fu than Jester Panda, regardless of the magical perfume she found. JP does an occasional fire ball, but that's it. Now, what kind of master is that? So don't waste your time or money on this. Get something else...."
1,"Dear God, make it stop!","Do you remember playing a video game, and then the action stops and they go to animation with bad acting and stuff you don't care about? This movie is like that, except the animation and acting are worse, and it lasts for 78 minutes.I have sat through some bad movies in my life, but this one makes ""Happily Never After"" look like ""Gone With The Wind"", and ""Gigli"" look like ""Citizen Kane"".Please--I implore you--if you're thinking about buying or renting this movie, take the money you would spend and wipe yourself with it. You will derive far more pleasure from that experience than from sitting through this this 78 minutes of living death.Giving it 1 star, because I can't rate it lower."
1,What a disappointment!!!,"What was I thinking? I purchased this movie because it said on the case ""from the artists and animators of Shrek and Shark Tale"".WHAT?? I am left wondering if this was a very early attempt at their animation. This movie was one big let down even for my four year old son. The graphics looked like something I could create on my personal computer. The story line was lame and the panda has an Italian accent! What ever you do, do not purchase this movie you will be disappointed. I see NO resemblance to either of the two movies advertised on the DVD case."
1,Horrible!,Terrible graphics! Looked more like a video game then a movie. I watched this with my 7 year old cousin and she hated it. Horrible storyline and character development.
4,Very Good Value,"I bought this bike for short trips to the store, park and sometimes to work. I 1st put it together w/o much trouble although you must have some common sence (the instructions are almost useless). On my rides I found the bike has a smooth ride and seating position is high. My only con I have is the tires are very thin. I had a flat in about a week and had to buy a thicker inner tube. So plan on doing this. All in all a very good value for a nice bike."
2,Just put it together,"Well, the bike got here today and I couldn't wait to put it together. I got a great price on it and am fairly good at putting things together. I looked and looked and didn't find any directions for the parts that I had, only directions for parts and peices that were already together.Anyway, no problem. Assembly still only took 90 minutes or so, and wasn't to difficult (This may be either a good sign or famous last words).The problem is that I can't ride it, the front tire doesn't hold air. So it looks great (1 star), and is put together easily (the 2nd star), but you can't use it.I am hoping that they will replace my tire as it came out of the box that way, maybe I'll come back and change the rating if they do."
3,Gumby Meets WWF,"Absolutly funny fictionous clay animation satire of celebritys fighting until death in an fighting ring. The funniest episodes were Garth Brooks versing Maralyn Manson, the Knight Rider guy versing John Tesh, and Arnold Schwartzenegger versing Sylvester Stallone. I have no idea what the names of those episodes are."
4,"<A cool vid, it will entertain >",", it will entertain thewhole family specialy children that want to see the celebs fight to DEATH!"
5,great entertainment,great to watch especially if you watch wwf cos STONECOLD STEVE AUSTIN sometimes appears on the show excellent clay-mation
5,This action game is Awesome,This game just can't describe. Not just the fun and graphics. The history and difficult of this game makes it really entertainment and exciting to play.
3,"Two steps forward, three steps back...","This game is awesome if you like hack & slash, button-crunching fight games. However, I remember when the Prince of Persia series used to focus more on puzzle-solving and strategy. Ah, the good ol' days of using your brain while playing video games. Remember?As far as the audio drop-outs that have been reported, I had this problem until I realized that the television my 'cube was hooked up to was outputting MONO sound. So I moved it to a TV with stereo output, and - voila! No more drop-outs!Overall, a fun game, but a step down from Sands of Time. and I'm sure the next one will be a step down from this since this one made the big money"
2,Problems with a Good Game,"The gameplay is incredible, and so is the music and story, but there are so many glitches! The music and sound effects are constantly dropped, during certain parts of the game it fades from black and white to color when it shouldn't, and I even had one of my save files corrupted because I viewed some of the concept art I had unlocked. It's a good game with fun play, but do yourself a favor and buy it for another system."
2,The end glitch ruins the game,"I was one of the people that ran into the glitch at the end that left me unable to fight the final battle. The more I read about this game, the more people I found with the same problem. It's horrible. I got through the entire game, which was not easy, and now I am unable to fight the final boss. The glitch is too common and the game ends up being a huge waste of time. Stick with the first one."
2,"Not perfect, But close to.",Now this is just my opinion but all free range hand-to-hand combat games are freaking awsome. Even if they dont have perfect grafics or any first person shooting capabilities. The grafics are obviously better than the first POP and the story is a bit better. Except the fact that the Dahaka kind of just came out of nowere and started attacking the prince. But overall this is a great free roaming/hand-2-hand fighting game. The controls are pretty easy to get used to and the game play is much easier and more challenging at the same time that The Sands of Time. Which consisted of fighting enemies as if they were boss battles. Plus the ability to control time makes you feel like god and be unstopable. The mazes are out of control and are amazing with the wall run/rope swing/ledge grab and jump ability. Good game.
1,Buyer beware!,"In the rush to release Prince of Persia: Warrior Within before Christmas, several fatal bugs were not corrected. These issues exist in every version of the game and make it impossible to continue when encountered. If you dare to play this game you will be required to have multiple saves in the event that you encounter one of these surprisingly common bugs. Even this is of little help, as you may not realize you have encountered a bug until you load your saved data and find yourself unable to continue. Ubisoft has been unable to provide adequate instructions as to how to avoid these bugs or to provide a patch to resolve these known issues. Purchase this game only if you are a die hard Prince of Persia fan whom has the patience to restart his/her game multiple times."
2,Prince of Problems,"This game has many major flaws. I am talking about software flaws that will inevitably ruin your gaming experience. I have never played a platform game with so many problems. The makers of this game should be ashamed of themselves for putting this out. What makes this even worse is the fact that I really want to like this game. I loved ""The Sands of Time."" That was a flawless gaming experience, so for them to follow-up with this game is very very disappointing. It seems as though the game developer got greedy and not only ruined the premise of the original game, but managed to release a buggy game too boot! Boo!!!"
3,Just a quick comment....,"This is a revised review since I now own the game and had a chance to see -- firsthand -- at the choices that Ubisoft made in the game's tone.Fun. Great puzzles. Annoying battle combos.As far as family fun -- which was my initial concern -- I was glad to see that the ""blood"" was an option that could be turned off in the menu. But the whole ""M"" rating is stupid. Ubisoft could've edited 2 or 3 words, put some clothes on the silly looking women characters and removed the blood altogether and widened their audience. Plus, my kids would be able to play it.I give it a C+."
3,This game is only good for Xbox and PS2.,This ain't good for Gamecube. It too hard to play on Gamecube. Only play it on PS2. It more easyer. This is good for Xbox and PS2.
3,It works...,"I found this when my syrian outgrew her 7-in ball. While it works, it is quite strange that there are no sizes between 7-in and 10-in. She is not quite as skilled at steering it, nor as skilled at stopping... but she can still make it go and it does not scare her anymore since she got used to it (about a week). I forgot to tape the door several times, but it seems a bit sturdier and she has not popped it open yet."
5,Jumbo excercise ball,"I liked the size of it. my pet fit in it comfortably. I did order clear and got orange instead,which freaks out my pet. i think clear would have been better for him."
3,"Bad ball, great Amazon customer service!","This is a mixed review. I orederd 3 of these. Two of them came without a lid!!! The one that has a lid is great though! Amazon sent me two replacements almost instantly. However...the 2 they sent me were also missing the lids!!! I was refunded without question, but from now on Ill probably buy one of these from a local store."
3,Works for something smaller.,"I have a ferret who spends a lot of her time cooped up in a cage. I figured why not get her a ball to roll around in, danger-free? Well, as it so happens, this 10"" ""jumbo"" ball is hardly large enough to fit her, and she can't exactly run around because it's impossible for her to get her footing. Mostly, it's a miserable plastic contraption my ferret just sits in and scratches at until she gets let out.However, the design is solid. I could see a guinea pig, mouse, or rat, happily bounding around inside this critter ball. It's easy to clean and straightforward to open and close. It's also pretty sturdy - all that clawing hasn't scratched up the plastic, and a short drop down the steps didn't crack it. it also seems pretty escape-proof."
4,"Great for Ferrets, but. . .","This one is really great for ferrets, but be sure your pet fits the size guidelines. Unfortunately the ball was a bit too small for our 2 1/2 pounder . . . lol. She's apparently a bit bigger than most, but we liked the durable Kritter Krawler so much, we're ordering the bigger ball anyway.All in all, it's worth the money and lets your pet play without fear of accidental injury due to chewing on wires if you take your eye off them for a second."
4,slightly disappointed,"I bought the beer can kit because of the description:Product FeaturesBeer Can Chicken Roaster constructed of sturdy stainless steel with square design for greater stability. Includes unique liquid canister and drip tray.However when I received the package, there is a sticker on the box sayingthat the drip tray is not included. I was very disappointed.I do like the square holder which stabilizes the chicken terrifically and love the canister instead of using a beer can."
5,Works:),"I bought this for my 1992 Geo Metro 4 door automatic 3cylinder, it just like any other timing belt, you put it on and your car runs. Just make sure you put your timing belt cover on, or it seems to work its way off. Other than that it works, great product."
1,Boring and confusing,"I haven't even finished it yet- but it has been a struggle to get as far as I have. Unless you like keeping track of hundreds of contradictory, speculative and unexciting details, avoid this book."
1,Money down the drain...,"This is a big disappointment. Not Mac-compatible, which is not stated anywhere on the disc or sleeve. V-e-r-y slow even on a fast PC, with a messy, un-intuitive interface. Some design suggestions are highly questionable, drawings are non-standard with very few measurements, some are of very poor quality."
4,good product,"The CD was helpful and contained detailed information about constructing a pedal steel guitar. Product arrived ahead of schedule, and was very happy about that."
3,Good Quality Bag. Ideal for maybe storage or limited carry,"The bag is awesome quality. Padded so that it doesn't hurt when it pushes up against me when I carry it. Initially I bought this bag hoping it would make carrying the bag easier as my office building doesnt allow me to carry a bike in without a bag.The bag would be nice if it had maybe a backpack strap so that it can be carried on the back.The way the handles are set up it's just very inefficient carrying and very uncomfortable. Shoulder strap is all but useless.Ultimately, the mobiky bike is meant to be rolled either way but an option to carry it on my back would have been better than having that much weight on one shoulder via a strap.Bag is also impossible to fold comfortably and carry while riding the bike as it does not fold up small at all, due to hard pieces in the bag.Currently the bag is used for storing my bike in my trunk to keep the bike protected from anything I throw in the trunk of my car. Here the bag functions flawlessly."
3,"Nice bag, but why doesn't this come with the bike in the first place?","The bag that comes with the Mobiky is really awful, so if you want a decent case, you have to buy this. That just seems a bit like a rip off when you consider the cost of the bike in the first place. This is a nicer bag -- but it just seems wrong to include such a cheap one with such an expensive bike in the first place. This brings the price up by close to another hundred bucks. Not cool."
4,Great update to a classic.,I just got this book in addition to the original Abiyoyo and wasn't sure about it at first. The new story and graphics are just as good as the first. Another great addition to any book collection.
2,No magic,"I LOVED Abiyoyo and read it a lot to the kids I babysit. The new one is cute, but it loses a lot of the fun, magic, and moral of the first one. I was very disapointed."
5,Abiyoyo Returns,This is a wonderful continuation to the story Abiyoyo. Abiyoyo is a song with orff accompaniment and story that I've used with 2nd graders. This will be a great enrichment story to go with this lesson. Thank you Pete Seeger.
4,Low price but does not smell cheap.,"One of the staple in my perfume wardrobe.very inexpensive is the one i wear when I'm in a rush or undecided.Don't let the name fool you, even if there is a hint of rose, cherry blossom and mimosa are the stars of this perfume.When i want to smell like a rose i reach for Stella or Stella Nude by Stella McCarthy.Give Cabotine Rose a try if you like fresh floral scents."
4,Cabotine Rose,"Love this scent. Have been wearing regular Cabotine for years and pleasantly surprised with the soft rose scent. However, toilette scent doesn't seem to last as long as I would prefer so will try finding in the Eau De Parfum."
2,Great concept,"But... I should have listened to the reviews. I think several others said it shows up without the the palm tree. Mine had the trunk of the tree, but no green top. It is impossible to get ahold of anyone to ask to send the top."
5,Awesome,Our turtles seem to love the environment. Even better than the palm tree turtle dish that I had as a kid.
1,please DO NOT buy this!,"Someone knew that I liked turtles and decided to give me one as a gift and used a 'habitat' like this as it's home. I quickly found out that these are neither suitable nor safe for any type of turtle or other amphibian. Turtles have several basic needs in order to stay healthy - UVB lighting (not just sun through the window), heat light, room to swim, and space to dry off. It is cruel and irresponsible to sell these ""perfect habitats"" - please do not buy these or support any company that does."
1,Horrible Don't Buy,This product is horrible for any animal to live in the only reason i gave it a one is because the rating don't go any lower no animal should have to live in this.I bought this for a travel container and after 4 minutes he climbed out of it he probably hated it so much
4,Okay if cared for right.,I have two small small hatchlings that play in a smiliar set up. I clean it every week. They have Toys to perch on..and it's healthy. I am currently buliding up a huge tank setup for when they get too big for this areana. The lagoon just needs to meet the turtles needs with your help.
1,If you want to KILL your turtle then buy this,This is the farthest thing from a healthy set-up for a turtle. It is a death bowl and is no where near adequate to house a turtle. It is way too small.DO NOT BUY THIS.
1,Wrong cd is sent to you,"I agree with the first review. Amazon has the wrong numbers for this cd. Hello Amazon is anybody home. I would really like to purchase Budgie and Beyond! Zero rating because of Amazon, not the seller."
4,Good instruction,Now this is a good dvd if you want real instruction on how to do correctly. Much better than others I've used.
3,Not good for an instructor,"It looks like a lot of parents of gymnastics like this video and that's great. I was a gymnast as a kid and it reminded me of my time in the gym, but I felt like there was not enough information. I would have liked to see some more tips on spotting and helping gymnasts to progress from one skill to the next one up. I was hoping that I could use the info to help me teach my girls some gymnastics at home but it didn't give me any new information."
4,Boys like this book,"Two nephews, aged 9 and 13 enjoyed this. I thought it was well written, although would have liked to see more actual content."
3,TR,"I'm a big TR fan, so it was natural to buy this book. The three stars come from the fact that this is a children's book, so the price is a bit much."
4,TimeOut doesn't disappoint,"I bought this guide book because I was familiar with the TimeOut magazine. This book is full of vivid descriptions and important information. However, because of all the descriptions, it is not so easy to use as a quick reference. I used it more as background reading for what I was about to see the next day or had just seen earlier in the day. Great amount of information for the price!"
2,Great..Until we got to Rome,"I was really excited to use these guidebooks. I had heard a lot of good stuff about them and they looked great when I was leafing through them. It seemed like we would have the ""locals"" guide to Rome. but boy was i wrong. After arriving in Rome, the books proved to be useless. Every restaurant we wanted to try seemed to be located on a street that didn't exist. I had three different maps I was using, and none of them had the streets on it. These books are great for history, but that's about it. Don't waste your time.."
4,realism among the desperation,"Hardy has written here 2 of his strongest characters and as well, 1 of his most annoying. Passion becomes a destructive force by the time all is said and done, yet afterwards, a rarity among Hardy stories, a happy ending does emerge. Bathsheba (a fascinating name to pronounce) is caught up in feelings she can't contain, which leads to both the quiet love of Gabriel (who lets nature takes its long silent course) and the future madness of Boldwood, whose own desire virtually ruins him. Throw in the 3rd party distraction of soldier Frank Troy and you have a near soap opera like quadrangle that pretty much determines the fates of all the main characters. You get a strong sense of farming life here- as sales, native farm hands, crops and weather patterns each come into play as every day hurdles and absurdities. Hardy really knows how to make every landscape a looming aspect of all his novels. You can almost inhale the scenery here."
4,A story of patience,"Though I have never read Thomas Hardy before, I shall again very soon. I greatly enjoyed Far From the Madding Crowd. I kept associating Bathsheba, the heroine, with Scarlett O'Hara. They are both women from the past who are struggling for a place where only men typically tread. Unlike Scarlett, Bathsheba's emotions are more restrained. She's so young, but matures through the book. The reader yearns for the day she finally matures to the point that realizes she needs a partner in life, and her perfect partner is Gabriel Oak, her steadfast mate of fate.I definitely recommend this book for one of those cold rainy weekends curled up on the couch.I am looking forward to diving into my next Thomas Hardy novel, Jude the Obscure."
2,"120+ years later, the formula is worn...","When this novel was published way back in 1874, the whole idea of 3 men competing for one woman might have been new and exciting. now, however, the whole book seems like just another love story, with the only hitch being it has 3 men instead of 2. Whoopie. the book has been done to death: there is really no true reason to read this book, unless it was forced upon you (like it was with me.) i've read this book and tried to understand why its a great english novel. With truly marvelous works by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Charles Dickens, and dozens of others writers, where does this boring, rambling book take seat as one of the ""classics""?"
5,Great!!!,"O2 is an awesome CD. Every single song is great. I listen to this album at least 5 times a day and I always want to listen to it even more. My favorite songs are Suddenly, Craving, and You Can't Lose Me. These songs have great lyrical depth and Suddenly and Craving were written by Ashley Angel who is my favorite member of O-town."
1,Sucks...,"This book was just plain terrible. I've seen better writing in an instruction manual. Moreover, the plot was weak."
3,Good work - but by no means his best......,"Vanity of Duluoz is a novel of reflection. To many of us Kerouac fans, nothing ""new"" will be presented here. But the story is told from a new Kerouac - not the wild, hip, drunkard from On the Road and The Subterraneans vein, but the quiet, reserved, almost conservative Kerouac of his later years. The book is as easy to read as his other works, perhaps easier. Its Kerouac in a reflective mode, where his thoughts are laid-out for us on the pages as plain and simple as they have ever been."
4,Door of Opinionated Death,"Like all the other books by R.L Stine Door of Death is a horror. Horrofyingly terrific, that is. The story is set over a hundred years ago. It has everything. Horror, mystery, love, deception and few pranks!!!!It is a great book and I recomend it to teens!"
1,What were they thinking?,"I've got to know what the people who work for the publisher of this book were thinking when it was approved for publication. I found this book in the young adult section, which is generally considered to be for kids 11 or 12 years old and up. Yet I was astounded by the level of violence in this book. Were it a movie instead of a book, this content would certainly have been given an R rating. There are numerous extremely graphic deaths in this book that are innapropriate in a book aimed at anyone younger than older teens. The author, editors, and publishing company were extremely irresponsible in issuing a book aimed at 11 and 12 year olds yet featuring extremely graphic violence. I would not reccomend this book to anyone and I would advise parents to think twice before buying this book. It's far too graphic for the target audience, but high schoolers would find it too simple and boring. I really can't think of any suitable audience for this book."
3,Enjoyed this book,"I don't know what you all are talking about... I read this book when it first came out in 1999 I was 11 and I didn't think it was any more gory than what is on tv and now 10 year olds are doing far worse things than reading a gory thriller. So, if you like thrilling stories you'll like this one. Yeah, it's not really realistic but what do you expect to find in a horror story? I enjoyed it back then so I recommend it, it's a good book for pre-teen/teens!"
1,"if you're into orgies and weed and drugs as a teenager, you might wanna read this","It's only available in SoCal at El Cajon library, for indigents, so I don't think much of State college of New york Cornell, and this pothead sr. professor of narrative writing. ( I told ya, look at his comment below. All they have to say if someone writes well or comes from Northwestern with mind blowin F. Scott Fitzgerald high, is like, oh, you're really arrogant. ARROW .. GANT... again and again. That's all they got for creativity. omg. it's a state college english dept. I'm serious man. I'm sick of em! them weeed bag leeches. them goons.)"
5,Babylon 5: Complete First Season,"If you've seen Babylon 5, you will enjoy reliving the early episodes again. If you've never heard of Babylon 5, how sad for you! This series will challenge your ideas of what is alien and occasionally give you a good laugh at the characters, and I do mean characters! As the various ambassadors come together on Babylon 5, a space station dedicated to the co-existence of all species, the personal conflicts, political intrigue, and everyday goings-on will keep you entertained for hours."
1,What is it with the cardboard case?,"I don't know how the Americans are doing with this box set,but the Australian region 4 Babylon 5 box set came in an impossibly tight and fragile cardboard case which makes it very difficult to remove the folding case with all the episodes. It is closed at one end and all this does is make the owner open that end to try and push the folding set out of the tight case. It is only a matter of time before the cardboard case rips. I hope that JMS gets this problem fixed before the season 2 box set is released.The series? Great series,bad packaging."
1,Bend Over for Warner Brothers,"For those of us who bought the VHS releases and have been patiently waiting to complete our collections, this really [stinks].A great series but not so great I want to buy it twice!In fact I may not be buying any Warner DVDs!Hook us up Warner Bros, put out the missing VHS!!!"
3,Stick with it! It does get good ... eventually,"This was my first taste of Babylon 5. After the first episode, I thought 'Why did I buy this?' Only the prospect of real quality sci-fi to come kept me watching. Looking back, I'm glad I did. About the first third of this is dreck: the special effects were very dated, the acting was forced, and the storylines were not cohesive, making it difficult to care about what was happening or the characters' plight. However, everything about the show improves drastically closer to the end of the season: the storylines tie together, the characters are better portrayed, the dramatic moments become actually dramatic, and even the special effects seem to look more sleek. The season ends with a bang, and I can't wait until Season 2 arrives in the mail! I give the first season only three stars because, as I mentioned, the first few episodes really are bad."
5,A great start,"I first joined the babylon 5 universe in the middle of season 2. I was hook very quickly but was always wondering what lay behind me.When TNT started showing reruns I was able to see what I missed!Boy did I miss a lot. There was a few bad episodes (TKO comes to mind) but all in all this was a very strong season. In fact by the time it has over I found myself missing Michael O'Hare.The amazing thing about this season is, even though I knew what was coming, these episodes held me entrapped.Part of that is the first season is a lot more self contain then the rest of the series (with the exception of season 5) another part is the style. This was one of the few seasons were there were other writers (including my personaly favorite -Peter David).It was also interesting to watch were these characters came from knowing were they ended particualy Londo and G'Kar.This is one of my favorite seasons and has probably the best season finale of the lot.This is a must buy for any B5."
2,Where's the pilot? It's not here.,"What kind of season boxed set doesn't include the pilot? There's a two hour pilot movie called The Gathering, and it's not included in this season 1 set! What was everyone thinking? Nobody even mentions it in any of the other reviews (that I've seen).I have friends that really enjoy this show. I've worked my way through many other SF shows, DS-9, SG-1, SG-A, Farscape, but they all included the pilot!I'll consider updating my review after I've finished the season."
3,This IS SEASON 1,"The Season the previous reviewer is referring to isn't a season, its the Pilot. Which is available on DVD. After the pilot, most shows go through some retooling, Babylon 5 was no different.Now, I'm holding off on buying this cause the last time I started investing in Babylon 5, Warner Bros decided to stop after realisng Seaons 1, 5 and the start of season 2 on VHS in the states... leaving me with not even half of the series.. and a great wad of money wasted.I'd recommend peopel wait until all 5 seasons have release dates before making this kind of investment"
3,Excellent series marred by shoddy production,I love the series but the quality here is at best VHS-level.
3,The season that killed the best TV show ever created,"Let's be honest, the first season of Babylon 5 just wasn't that good. O'Hare was a terrible actor, the other characters hadn't come into their own yet, the arc story hadn't kicked in. It was just a cheap rip off of Star Trek at this point with a lame arc story about Sinclair's missing memories.But here is the rub. This show, starting with season 2, is the best TV show ever. But you can't just ignore season 1. It turns out that there is too much of importance here to the later arc story. We just didn't know it at the time.So I'll give it 3 stars. Probably only 2 stars stand alone and 5 stars as part of the whole epic story."
4,A must for Sci-Fi Fans,"To any sci-fi fan, this is a must. It re-writes what is or isn't a sci-fi series."
5,A Masterpiece for Television,"Babylon 5 is a rare show indeed it was a novel for television with each season a book and every show a chapter. I think that the first season is the weakest in the five year run but yet it laid the foundation for seasons to come. I am really pleased with the Dvd compilation released by warner brothers they did a very good job with it. For one the picture quality is very good and only a little grain and dust show up. Also if you compare the picture quality with the tapes and the original broadcast footage the dvd picture is vastly supieror. They also threw some good extras in to and did something that was really great, they through in the original previews of the original episodes and is something that is not used enough in other dvd releases of tv shows. But to reiterate, the first season even though it was the weakest season in the five season run it was still a great season."
3,love the show hate the dvd's,"While I still feel Babalon 5 will earn a place in Sci-Fi history as one of the more enduring shows. I was extremely displeased with the quality of the DVD's. I mean, I'm not knocking the show, I love it. The DVD was like watching an old film print. Those little flecks of white here and there on the screen drove me nuts. Hey, I'll probably still purchase the rest of the 4 seasons if they put them out but please clean em up."
5,Finally...,"I've been waiting for this series to show up on DVD. This truely has been one of (if not the) best sci-fi series to be made fro TV. Season five was weak compared to the rest of the series, but the storyline has always been captivating. I can't wait to see it again..."
1,sucks so far,"I've watched the first five episodes, and so far, I find it pretty bad. The hair on the Centari's is laughable. I don't know how the actors got through it without laughing all of the time. Unless they thought this was as low as they could sink. The stories, so far, are very boring. I'm considering taking the rest of the series to a used DVD store if it doesn't get better soon. I was hoping I would like this, since I tend to like a lot of good sci fi and have every episode and movie from the Star Trek franchise. Please, someone tell me, that this later gets much better. Right now, I feel like I should be getting paid to watch this."
2,Formatted to Widescreen....not good AT ALL,"I am a big fan of most SciFi... even B5. :) Unfortunately, this series was filmed in a 4:3 format and Amazon stretched to fit a widescreen format. I purposely rented the 1st episode to see the quality level. It was done in a regular format and it was fine. So it tricked me into the purchase where the rest of the series was stretched. Large numbers of scenes are really blurry. Since this is a digit download I should be able to choose how I view it for the best enjoyment. I don't recommend buying the digital download. You can buy the discs and load them into your cloud storage yourself."
4,One of the best sci-fi series ever!,"I just finished watching the last cd from the set. It's been several years since I've seen Babylon 5 and I really enjoyed watching it again. This is not like Star Trek; it has a more gritty feel to it. I believe B5 reflects how our interaction with other races would actually be. While I enjoy Star Trek, it generally seems to 'clean'. The characters do develop as the shows progress, and bits and pieces from previous shows begin to come together.I just saw season 2 is coming out in April, and I can't wait! I gave this only a 4 star rating since the dialog during the theme music at the beginning is really bad! Let's see, ""all alone, in the night...it can be a dangerous place..."". They must have thrown this together rather quickly!Other then that, I can't wait to have the complete set!"
4,"Finally, B5 on DVD!!","It took a long time to arrive, but it is well worth. Not only B5 was one of the best series I've ever watched, but had also a nice message to everyone - about how life and friendship change and how to deal with it. Well written, interesting characters and a story that hold everybody until the end.Year one was a little bit slow, but important for the whole plot and full with misteries.A warning to the region 1 customers, this box is being sold in Europe for 30 Euros (check at Amazon.de), less than half of the US [dollars] for the North America version. And the European comes with more languages, showing how the studios like to rip money from fans."
4,ENJOYMENT,I FOUND AS MUCH PLEASURE IN BABYLON 5 NOW AS I DID WHEN I FIRST WATCHED IT. TIME HAS NOT DULLED THE QUALITY OF THIS SHOW.
5,I had almost forgotten!,"Wanted to go back and relive the series, and happy to find it all available for streaming! I'd like a better price for a whole season, but it was great to find for a quick fix."
3,Worth It!!!,The acting leaves a lot to be desired in the first season. But it was worth getting through the first season. This series is fun and interesting. A worthy choice for scifi fans.
4,And so it begins,"The first season of what eventually became a five year series, plus a spin off, and several movies.It introduces the characters, gives them basic personalities, and the whole time, a plot that links the episodes together is being woven, right under your nose.Each episode is a story. Each season is a story. Babylon 5 is a story."
4,Babylon 5 - The Complete First Season DVD,"I know the story in first season is weak so it is the beginning of story. It is excellent chronologly timeline of story. But I am disppointed with Warner Bros about no closed captioning on special features, ie, commentary."
2,I feel like I'm being lectured,"Not being a previous fan, I just started to watch B5 for the first time ever just because I like SciFi. I had hefty expectations because of the rave reviews. Now looking back on the first season I find it moderately awful. The silly acting and the weak CG-effects only serve as a vehicle to deliver someone's social dreams and views about various political, ethical, and philosophical issues of our day. Many previous productions have felt an obligation to use SciFi as societal mirror, trying to improve the world one viewer at a time. Somehow, producers are ridden by a self-agrandizing wish for accomlpishment in the bettering of humanity coupled with a fear of creating SciFi purely for viewing enjoyment. There is a place for everything. If I watch SciFi I am trying to get away from this world, and not watch one that had to be painfully and ebarrassingly torqued in order to serve as a parable for the social studies classroom."
4,Babylon 5~The complete first season,"I am not into SCI-FI at all. I bought this series for my fiancee as he loves the series. I have to admit after sitting down and watching a couple of episodes, I don't completely dislike them. I found them entertaining and not remotely like I had envisioned. The product is a good one. The pricing was unbeatable in the retail world. I'm very pleased with my purchase."
4,Oh the Pain....But it was Worth it.,"Please, don't judge this series by it's painfully dull first episodes. I read the reviews and was prepared for it. So as I sat patiently waiting for it to get better I knew there was hope in the form of seasons 2-5. So bear with the bad acting (does not apply to all actors)horrendous and often laughable music and dear lord the tedious plots. Because I promise every single one of those things improves tenfold. The music must have been complained about because it is completely different. Some actors were replaced and others became more comfortable with their roles. And the plot actually produced audible gasps from me at more than one point. Quite a challenge and I never saw it coming. So bear with it and you won't be disappointed."
2,Season 1 is really the calm before the storm,"Although the B5 series is, in my view, one the best sci-fi series, season one is really just a build up to the greatness.Newcomers should not expect to be overly thrilled with season 1, but it sets up a chain of events for the other seasons to come. However, don't think you can safely skip this season. As I said: ""calm before the storm"". Not that there is little action (it's the opposite), but compared to the other seasons, it's just the tip of the iceberg.Only 2 stars for this reason. And those 2 stars are in comparison to the series. If I were to compare it to other sci-fi shows, it would have gotten the full 5 stars."
4,"Great series, disappointing box set","Ditto what everyone here has said about this amazing story. And ditto what some have pointed out as production shortcomings regarding this DVD box set. The extras are nice, the sound mix is terrific but the picture quality is disappointing. I was expecting the aliasing issues with the F/X, which were apparently produced in full-frame and not the letterboxed ratio of the live-action shots. What stunned me were the scratches and dirt on this transfer -- isn't the whole point of going DVD so we don't have to put up with such things?I'm looking forward to Seasons 2,3, and 4 (the 5th is the weakest by far). But I do hope Warner Bros. can clean up these transfers."
5,Awesome Story Arc,"When it first came out, I was put off by the cheesy early episodes. But this series has wonderful character actors and a long story arc that builds and unfolds and interconnects. The best science fiction on television."
3,Series great. Transfer iffy.,"The series itself is great, even with 1990s effects. But the transfer to DVD was fairly poor at times."
5,And so it begins,"This DVD set is a must-own for any B5 or Sci-Fi fan. Season 1 is not the best of the 5 seasons, but it serves to set up a lot of character and plot developments for later on in the series. Babylon 5 is no doubt the best Sci-Fi television series ever made. The story does not end and start over with each episode, but instead builds on itself to create a story arc that will span all 5 seasons. It is well worth the time to watch the series; you will find yourself immersed in the storyline and the characters before you realize it."
3,Same series; poor video and sound quality,"If you liked Babylon 5 the first time, this is the same series.The owners of the product put little to no effort into the repackaging and re-release.Compared to the work that Henson Studios put into Farscape, the video and sound quality get a D or an F.I am watching through a first class up-scaling Blue Ray player and 50"" Plasma TV.IF this is re-released on Blue Ray, they should redo the graphics, re-record the sound track and put some effort into the video transfer and clean it up."
3,Promising start....,"I missed out on Babylon 5 when it aried, and have never really watched it, though I am usually a sucker for scifi TV shows (even bad ones!) This first ep/pilot isn't great on it's own, but is promising. (At this writing, I have not yet watched any other epsisodes...)The acting is a bit wooden -- especially Micaheel O'Hare as the commander -- he just doesn't seem to fit. But Peter Jurasik's Londo is swell in a somewhat minor role at this point. He seems like likeable scum -- one of my favorite character types.The plot (don't worry, i won't give spoilers) is a confusing bit of business, mostly designed to introduce the players and races, and reveal details about the commander's past. (I assume they will become signinficant later, but no more said about that here.)I would give this 3.5 stars if Amazon had half-scores -- and it's defintiely enough to get me to watch more of the series."
4,digital quality,Babylon 5 is a great scifi and would have given it 5 stars if the digital quality of the show was better.
3,Story line is okay. Sometime you can guess the end before it come.,"I wasn't bored, but the writers were. I like the actors and the makeup was good. Not much more to say."
5,Just what i wanted,I have always liked the old tv show babylon 5. Now that i have this season. I am very happy with it
4,B5 -- 1st Season DVDs,"Packaging was weak and had some plastic broken that holds the disks, otherwise DVD's worked fine, no issues. Show is great!"
4,Better than I remember,"I really didn't like Babylon 5 in the beginning. I stopped watching the show sort of early in the first season when it was originally airing and didn't start watching it again until late in the second season when it was recommended to me again. Watching it again - I've been marathoning the whole series over the last few days - I find the first season much better than I remember. While I am still put off by the low budget special effects and the less than stellar acting of the CO. I have found the story more engaging knowing what comes later and have enjoyed it very much. The show also picked up much sooner than I remember, and it was less than halfway through the first season that you are on to the fact that B5 is truly epic in scope. If you turned off B5 when it was originally on, I recommend giving it another go, if you really can't stomach it at all, skip toBabylon 5 - The Complete Second Seasonwhen it becomes truly great and get into the series that way."
2,Good show terrible video transfer,"The producers of this must not have looked at the finished product on a large screen TV. There are compression artifacts everywhere, and interlace artifacts in most motion scenes. I have never seen a video transfer this poor in a DVD produced by a major studio.I am a big fan of Babylon 5, and it is great to watch the episodes in order without commercials, but the production quality is very disappointing."
4,Video quality only drawback,"It's hard to complain about the arrival of B5 to DVD, because at least we now have this brilliant series presented in it's best form yet. The only drawback is that there are noticeable artifacts in the video. Sure, I'd love to have *more* commentary from creator J.M. Straczynski, a blooper reel (like the Andromeda series DVDs), and deleted or expanded scenes. I really do like the menus and the trailer previews included for every episode. Hopefully Warner Bros. will look closely at how much extra stuff is going into the Star Trek series DVDs and go ahead with more bonus features. You'd think they'd have time since there's a six month wait between seasons. Bottom line: every fan should have this incredible series on DVD, and for those who haven't seen this great series unfold over it's 5 year run, the best sci-fi treat you could give yourself is the Babylon 5 series DVDs."
4,Very Satisfying Watching,My family and I really enjoyed watching the complete first season. We watched many of the original series and still catch it on the Sci-fi channel when able. We feel that the series was for the most part very true to life as far as behavior in a political and business trade setting. What I mean is the lieing and misleading of rivals in order to further their own agenda.We would very much enjoy to see the second thru the fifth season become available for purchase. I would like to know when this is scedualed to happen.
3,Good but not 3 HP,"Good overall saw. I will not go in depth but don't make the mistake I did. This saw struggles with rips, especially hardwoods. Making mahagony railings was a chore. I had to complete on my Dad's 3 HP unisaw.For the general wood worker it's fine. Perhaps a cabinet maker who is constantly working with birch plywood, and 1 x's it's fine. But if you ever would need to get into ripping something other than that. Don't but this saw, get the 220 line and buy a 3 HP.!"
2,"""House"" is a definite fixer-upper","I picked up this novel with high hopes after reading the summary. However, i was very disappointed with the unexciting plot. You'll find it very unconvincing (how could a responsible parent allow her teenage son to pick out the home where they shall live without checking out who owns it? I don't think so). In addition, the dialogue was very dull and it was quite boring. A big let-down. :("
1,The House of Cruddy Storylines,"This book stinks! It goes up! and up! and up, until halfway through the book they totally destroy the plotline. NEVER READ THIS BOOK! Some parts were enjoyable, although I almost put the book down so many times. NEVER READ THIS BOOK!"
1,Total waste of 10 bucks,If they had a no star selection I would have rated it that. A PP presentation with not even any talking pionts.
2,ONLY FOR CERTAIN READERS,"THIS BOOK IS MORE ABOUT THE AUTHOR, THAN THE CHILD, OR THE PROBLEMS. THIS IS DEFINITELY THE ""CHICK FLICK"" OF ASPERGER BOOKS. IF THAT IS WHAT YOU WANT, THEN GREAT, OTHERWISE LOOK ELSEWHERE."
2,Badly produced DVD?,"I hoped for an actual complete program and it was, start to finish. However the disc doesn't play right. Since you can play the disc with or without commercials, the commercials on program one do not play where they belong. Twice the screen freezes during a scene and a commercial plays. After the commercial the screen freezes at the start of a different scene and then resumes on yet a different scene. I'm waiting to hear from the maker of this disc if it's a bad run or just badly produced. I'm anxious to actually watch the program! Program two plays just fine."
2,"Vandals Rock, But This Doesn't","i have 6 vandals albums: live fast diarrhea, hitler bad vandals good, oi to the world, peace thru vandalism, sweatin' the oldies, and the quickening. I headed down to best today to go buy Fear Of A Punk Planet (the only album I don't have besides this one) but they didn't have it and their which like 5 copies of this one so i decided to buy it. I fully knew it wouldn't be all that good but the vandals are my favorite band and anything by them is worth it to me, however if your not a HUGE fan like me stay away from this and buy the live album."
1,WHAT THE!,"This is not good at all. I bought this CD today and I am very sad right now. This CD is way worse than Hitler bad, Vandals good so if you didn't like that album you won't like this one. The last two tracks are the worst the Vandals have ever played. What happened to The Legend of Pat Brown or Anarchy Burger?"
3,cheez-it=Moron!,"Well I couldn't help but laugh when I saw cheez-its review. If he had been paying any attention to the vandals lately, he would've known that they don't play these songs live, and that it's a re-release of their Slippery When Ill album. They didn't make this album to make $, they did it for the fun of it. The Vandals aren't rednecks. They're more punk than you'll ever be...Oh yeah and by the way, I give it three stars because although it has some good/funny songs on it, it did have some pretty bad ones."
4,Punk geniuses strike again!,"Punk legends the Vandals prove again why they're better than the rest. 10 hilarious punk-a-billy tracks that throw water balloons at country music while playing it. The lyrics are brilliant as usual on a Vandals disc, but this disc isn't the Vandals CD you should start with. Vandals fans who REALLY get the Vandals will appreciate this clever record. Best tracks include: ""Goop all over the phone"", ""Susanville"" and ""Elvis Decanter"". Great CD for Vandals fans, just make sure you're familiar with their other work or you'll be left scratching your head like Cheez-it was. Vandals rule!"
3,It's a really bad vandals album.,"They even warn you in the title. It's bad. It's terrible! It's hilarious, but virtually unlistenable.I have read reviews saying they were ""experimenting"" and ""going a different direction"". No they weren't! They remade Slippery When Ill into a horrible country album. Its a joke! Just like the Shingo Japanese Album. They arent experimenting with Japanese rock-they were remaking their stuff into some bizarre Japanese stuff! It's hilarious!Buy it for fun, you will only listen to it once, and probably not all the way through."
4,Buckley is always interesting! even if you differ with him,"I remember his running for New York City Major. I read this book in college. He know he was not going to be elected. But Buckley put The Conservative Party on the map in that campaign. And in 1968 his brother, James Buckly, was elected to the office of US Senator from New York State-- on the conservative party line. James Buckley was a very significant Senator."
2,would not recommend,"Food does not cook evenly. Food in the very center of the griddle takes forever to cook and food on the ends of griddle cooks faster on the inside (part closest to the flame) than on the outside (part closest to the edge), which means that this product is not a very good conductor of heat. Food would probably cook evenly on an electric griddle, but that occured to me after using this product. I use it and plan to keep it because I don't feel like going through the trouble of returning it, but I'm not crazy about it and I definitely would not recommend it."
5,Pancakes-a-Plenty,This griddle is huge. Plenty big for my wife and I for breakfast. It doesn't burn easily and is very easy to clean.
1,Not what i asked for. Not at all.,"The video i ordered "" executions 2. was not what came. The movie i received was the cover of the video displayed "" autopsy"" this is nothing to do with the movie i bought.. sadly. because i got this from UK. it costs me more to have it sent back to aus and then refunded. SO thanks to the missleady seller Once again amazon was F'd me over."
3,"Ok, but not too flavorful","Bob's Red Mill is a great company and always has good quality products but this one misses the mark in taste. If the label didn't say Apple Cinnamon, I would have thought it was plain."
2,Fair but I would not buy it again.,I am not saying it is horrible. I just prefer the muesli made by the same company. It may just be a matter of taste.
5,"Addictive, but it does have fat","The description says ""no fat"" but it is really ""no fat added"". It does contain some fat but its less then other granola.I wish i could eat smaller portions, but its so good i keep going back to get more. I guess its still better than eating a box of fat filled sugary cookies."
4,Very nice product - Works Well,This product works well if you keep the outside units with in the recommended distance from the main unit.
5,my advice : buy this as a reference,"The pro's : Very good, everything is explained in a clear way, starting from the beginning, no gaps left in the proofs, and the material is abstract enough to motivate math lovers...In fact every math undergraduate and graduate should have this book as a reference, this cannot be a problem when you see the price.The con's : Dover always has cheap price editions. While there is definitely a market for this, let' s face it : these editions have some disadvantages : While the contents of this book are very well suited not only as a reference but also to learn the material, the dense layout is not so comfortable to learn from. In that sense, the authors deserve a better edition... Maybe a question to the Dover guys : is it possible to bring your excellent science books in two editions : the existing cheap editions, and another more comfortable edition : bigger size, more whitespace on each page, ...."
5,One of a kind book,"Few books on the topic of 3D and game engines are as thorough as Eberly's latest. He walks you through a top shelf commercial quality engine (minus some bells and whistles) and gives strong details and motivations behind the entire codebase's design choices.Not only is it well written, its generous of him to continue to make this quality code so cheaply available to readers. A job well done, I urge all fellow hobbyists and professionals to support his work."
4,Good but not classic,"Eberly's latest book is worth a read for those interested in game/graphic engine architecture. This is not a book on the latest and most sophisticated graphics algorithms. It is a book on architecting a well designed, commercial quality game engine. I think it will be especially useful for those trying to improve the design of an existing architecture.I really liked his treatment of continuous level of detail, terrain and bounding volumes. Though I did find some other sections were pretty dry. In particular I think the first chapter was pretty drawn out and didn't help motivate me for the rest of the book.The CD comes with tons of source code accompanied by some lengthy release notes. Don't let the release notes scare you as you should only have to change a few things to get the code to compile.If you're using/planning to use the Wild Magic engine, this book is required reading."
2,Dull,"Tsk Tsk. Prince of Persia the Sands of Time as a wonderful game, full of fun things to do, a good plot line and other things. But THIS, this peice of crap is graphic and full of bad language. This is the kind of game society has morphed into. The gore, the voilence. This game is for little kids or losers who think that killing is funny. Theres no need for this type of a game."
2,Please rent!,"Prince of Persia the Sands of Time is probebly the best game of 03 and is still one of the best to this day. Warrior Within is probibly one of the stupidest games of 04 and 05. there are no challaging puzzles in this game, and if there are, they dont exciet you very much. The enemie AI is so stupid its not funny. THERE ARE SO MANY FREAKEN GLICHES THAT IT'S NOT EVEN FUNNY. 5 or 6 times i was in an sand monster trying to kill him, there are invisible walls everywhere, and the game you can beat in about 7-8 hours, not cool. Now you're thinking, now why believe this guy? Well I beat all 3 games about 25 TIMES, 25 TIMES, i would know. Instead buy the first game, rent the second game (unless die-hard fan), and buy the 3rd game. The Two Thrones you should pick up. Now go on and play the better game you peoples?!?!?!"
2,The prince is a gymnist not a warrior,"This game has wonderful graphics and tight controlls, but it should be called ""Gymnist Within."" The prince has incredible physical abilities that are fun to use in battle; when he is fighting. Jumping from polls, runing along walls, and dodging the same traps over and over again are what you will use his abilities for most of the game. The camera works half of the time; the other half it acts as a hinderence. Buy this game if you always wanted to be an Olympic gymnist, but your genetics just wouldn't allow it."
2,DO NOT Buy,I loved the sands of time so naturaly I bought the sequel. This game stinks they made the prince into an idiot. All this game is is mindless killing with an ocasional puzzle in which is always a repeat from the last game. In this game the prince swears constantly and can kill and will every thing in his path. Last game the prince was a gymnist and a puzzel solver. In this game he's a demented warrior freak who wants to change his destiny. This game seems to explain why our society is so violent. It's just mindless killing and swearing (just what we do). Only people that think killing is fun or are just idiots will like this game unless u are one of the above do not buy this game it is a waste of money!!!!
1,two words for this game,"i played the game for 2 hours... I WENT TO SLEEP...not good, not even worth trying.."
4,The almost PERFECT game.,"The overall game was very good. I liked the story-line, but the game itself could have been longer. On the downside, the game was too dark and the health upgrades were difficult to find without the help of a stategy guide. I did like the new acrobatics and fighting skills and I hope that the 3rd game is just as much fun and hopefully I will be able to see where I am going within the game. I would definitely recommend this game to someone else."
3,Never Played the first Prince of Persia,I have to say that this is one of the most challenging games that I have ever played. I never played a game where you had to do a certain kind of jump just to get to the other side. I think that is why I got so frustrated with the game because when I play I would rather just do a regular jump then run up the wall. The graphic were good they had a lot of detail. I don't really have a lot to say about the game because I rented it and didn't get very far. Lol. I can say that after playing this game I don't think I'm going to try to play the first Prince of Persia game. I did see that a lot of people say that the first game was better so I might give it another chance.
2,Slow and lacking,"This game is the best produced least fun game I have ever played. Trial and error puzzles are no fun. I could also not help but think they were lifting very heavily from Jak 2/3 in there ""new"" character design. Wow he is dark and edgy but still is slow and non responsive. The animations are nice and the visual are good it just comes down to the core game being completely repetitive and mundane. Also like the first one the game is extremely short with no replay value. Some of the game geeks really like this game but for most rent before you buy."
3,A smidgeon above mediocre,"This game is just a tad above mediocre at best, and I'm personally shocked that some other reviewers award it higher merits. Are we talking about the same game here? The game play is redundant, the environments repeat over and over and over again, the combat consists of nothing more than slightly glorified button-mashing, and the story line really doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Yeah, I'll admit that the graphics are okay, running along walls is a bit fun, and slicing demons in half is vaguely rewarding the first few times. But otherwise? All you have is a game that's just above the average. It could have been much much better."
3,For Parents,"I have played this games first level in it's early stages, and it wasn't that bad. If the final hasn't changed too much, I will get it. Be warned, there is intense violence and lots of blood. I don't know why the producers had to put so much blood in it, as well as a half naked girl. If you have a mature kid under 17, you should consider this game. Otherwise, be heisitant. I think this game does deserve to be rated M, but I think it's content has yet to get to the level of Halo 2 or GTA San Andreas. So don't just look at the rating and say no, there is much more to consider. I love this game fully, but could only give it 3 stars for some content that only made some fans turn away. If your over 17, don't heisitat, and buy it right away."
5,prince of persia 2 warrior within used cd,"fast shipping,used in great condition,game plays everytime,recieved item in time for christmas as a gift,will buy from seller again"
2,Disappointed,"I don't like POPWW as much as POPSOT. It's ok. I think they changed the entire game by focusing too much on the battle system (including a lot of blood).You still have the cool moves like running along the wall but this game reminds me of a shooter game. All fight and nothing else. The first one had a sense of humor, a good story, puzzles, a perfect amount of fighting and a fun side kick. Now you have this ugly obnoxious barely clothed woman that you have to fight through the game and it's really boring. Why do game developers always have to make drastic changes? POP Sands of Time was a great game. If it ain't broke don't fix it. I'm just sorry that I bought it. I should have rented it first."
1,Aaaaarrrrghhhh!,"This is just great potential wasted. The flaws lie in the outrageous difficulty (you try beating The Emperess), messed up controls (rolling the wrong way cos the camera moved, causing you a fatal accident) and the checkpints (you'll find yourself 40 mins back whenever you die, which is every few minutes). If you combine these the game does nothing but (...) constantly. There is absolutely nothing to enjoy here, because what is good is simply eclipsed by the hard nature and frustrating fights. The fight with The Emperess are really the points where you'll think ""I just don't want to waste my time on this, (...)"
2,Dont Buy!,"This is a down grade from Pop 1! I cannot believe UBISOFT did this the whole game is unbalanced! It goes from ez to hard in seconds, the puzzels anit fun! The Graphics and the music rox though! The combo system is cheap! i beat it but im never playin it again. Hopefully POP 3 will be better!"
3,Nostagic for the POP sands of time,"Every holiday, I buy a new game for my husband and we play together -- with his hand at the controls. We enjoy more RPG type games than hacky slashy stuff. I am sad that the music in Warrior Within is more heavy metal than beautiful, that the scenes are less well-lit and not as stunning and that there are half-naked women that scream alot when you are fighting them -- for 30 minutes in a row. If you are a good fighter, you get to call the woman, ""[...],"" etc.I know that there are more cool moves, etc. but still. Serious gamers are going to argue that I need to keep playing to get to the one ""good"" woman character and for all the other fun stuff, but first impressions are important and I am not happy.I know that I am not really the market that this game is trying to reach, but I am still sad about the blood, violence and t&a; action that is a major part of this new POP. It's hard to find stuff that I can enjoy."
2,Weak construction,"I have the DLO PodFolio for the iPod Nano and although it has some good features, it has a fatal flaw in that the back ripped apart after only a couple months of use."
4,dec. case,"this case is very fancy looking, got the protection it needed, the only thing is that it smells for the first week...."
1,Definitely not sturdy - Almost lost the iPod!,"While this case is undeniably sleek and attractive, it is most definitely not sturdy or durable. The clip parted company with the case only a few months post-purchase, and after only careful usage and no pulling or twisting on it at any time. This very nearly cost me a $400 iPod (I found it on the front lawn, thank goodness the case decided to come apart before I left the property). Definitely not satisfied with this case, and cannot recommend it."
1,DON'T BUY!!!!!!!!!!,"If you have a 30 gig. video iPod, mabey. But for a 60 gig. it is too tight to it, got a mark on iPod after taking it out, covered up part of the screen on mine, and I'm taking it back right away.It is a waste of money to buy this product and I made a mistake by getting it for myself. Get a different case than this one."
5,Couldn't want anything better,"this leather case has a grate fill to it, and it looks grate with my 30GB ipodWhen open you can easily reach the hold batten, or the iPod's controls, and when close it is very well protectedI highly recommend it.DLO PodFolio Leather Case for 30 GB and 60 GB iPod Video (Black)"
2,Nice case...if the correct one was sent,"My fiance tried to buy me this product. The packaging even listed the 30 GB 5G video i-pod as being compatible. So I tossed the packaging. I was in for a surprise when I finally got around to trying it a week later - it is ONLY designed for the i-pod touch (see link)DLO HipCase Leather Folio Case for iPod touch 8 GB and 16 GB (Black)...is what I appear to have receivedIt does appear to be decent quality - too bad the one I actually want appears to be discontinued.So, anyone need an i-pod touch case???:)"
5,"Great Item, Great Price","A case at a much lower price than all this ""name brand"" iPod cases. As far as I am concerned this one looks better and is a much better quality. Awesome price too!"
4,"tight fit for 30G samuel greinke by greinke, samuel","i bought one and it fits perfectly to the 30G video ipod. it's more descreet with its foldover cover and the leather gives it more softness and protection than plastic cases. Overall it's great for the car.by samuel greinkeor greinke, samuel"
4,Great fit,"I picked this case based on top flip, reviews that said the fit was great, and price. Glad that I did. Other than no color options, which is why it is a 4, the fit was great, the magnetic closure works, and it is snug. Also, the openings work great too: screen, scroll, plug are perfect. I am not crazy about the phone ear/head phone jack since I can not leave my plug in and both open & close the case. But this is a relatively minor annoyance. If they came out with other colors I would buy another one!"
5,Remembering Grandma,"I loved Janets book so much because it brought memories of my grandmother, all her wisedom and knowledge of herbs and potions, we were poor, but grandma was the glue that held our family together, she also read cards, which is why I was drawn to Janets book. thanks for writing this book and I hope another book comes along soon.I highly recommend this book, read it you won't be sorry."
5,I'm not even half way through this book and I can't put it down,I'm not even half way through this book and after reading just the first chapter the advice he gives is so clear and makes total sense. I would recommend anyone to read this book if they are looking for healthy change in their relationships with themselves and others.
2,Minor in possession,Will be eager to read more of his books. My mother in law is saving them in case they arnt available on kindle
5,Minor in Possession,This book was very good and interesting through out the whole book. I have read alot of her books and they have been all very good.
3,not happy,I had already read this book and didn't realize it till I got it. Really enjoy the first time I read it.
4,Classic Jance,"I love this series...when does something else come out?My husband is from Seattle, so reading one of these books is like taking a little trip to downtown and hanging out like we used to do."
5,"Unlike other business books, Kerr delivers a detailed discussion on just how to implement the ideas he is promoting","Unlike so many other popular business books out there, like The World Is Flat, Blue Ocean Strategy and Execution that tend to provide more of history lesson than a solution, Kerr delivers a detailed discussion on just how to implement the ideas that he is promoting. Each chapter includes details on how to get things done and the book augments these thoughts through a great many sidebar stories about what other businesses are doing in regard to Kerr's Best Practices concepts.I highly recommend this book and believe I will convert many of these ideas into results for my Company in the near future.--Senior Technology OfficerFortune 10"
5,It's a competitive world!,"""I really like this book! Its premise is that an organization needs to do these best practices extremely well in order to perform higher order activities that seem to be more glamorous (i.e., Six Sigma, Privacy Management, Business Globalization). I couldn't agree more, we need to go back to basics in order to remain positioned for new opportunities ... it's a competitive world.My one gripe is that the core material is not particularly novel. But, it is presented in a fresh, new way. I've read Kerr's other books and many magazine articles over the years and he does have a way of reducing complex concepts into their simplest forms so that everyone can understand them. He has done a nice job here, too. If you're an executive, or just want to be one, you should give this book a try."""
5,IT Strategy Consultant,"I can strongly recommend this book to anyone interested in doing things right in a large corporate setting. Whether you're an executive that tackles this task yourself or you solicit the help of a professional, this resource offers an insightful analysis of strategic planning, including extensive real world examples that demystify the subject. Where other books fall short, Kerr does an artful job of translating the topic into an approach that will stick."
4,good book,"in this book, an accident occurs between mike and steven, and steven is arrested for attempted murder (!!!). jess soon is having to choose between her duty to her husband, and to her own freedom. elizabeth finally discovers who the leader of the secret society is, and he is not too happy about it. (hint: the initials are W.W.!!!) todd finally dumps lauren and now he wants liz back, but she's busy falling for someone else. (hint: do you even need a hint to figure this one out??!!) a good book for svu fans."
3,Pretty good...,"I really liked it that Liz and Tom got together.. I've grown a little irritated with Todd- he's been with Liz at least since they were twelve years old! In the earlier books I was just waiting for him to tell Liz how he feels, or the other way around. But no, Liz had to mess with that scheming William. With Liz and Tom, it is true love. What is going on with Jessica and Mike and Steven is also very suspending. I'd say this is an average SVU book- that's where the three stars come from."
1,Yuck!,"This book was horrible! Tom and Liz got together, even though Todd and Liz rock AND WILL ALWAYS GET BACK TOGETHER! This book was sickening, and I never want to read it again. I would not waste your money on this one- buy another book, like #27, ELIZABETH AND TODD FOREVER. That book was good. This book was the worst book from Francine, and I hope she does better from now on!"
3,English Subtitles Awful!,"I'm a big fan of Song Hye Kyo (Gyo) and I anticipated the release of this movie, ""Hwang Jin-Yi."" However, since English is the only language I know, it was very disappointing to know that this DVD itself does not have the English subtitle option. Luckily, the DVD player that I was using gave me the option to play this particular DVD in English. To my surprise, the subtitles was awful. The English was very broken as if it actually translated the main movie's language, word for word into English. For those that know any foreign language, you would know that trying to translate it into English would require you to re-word it so that you can understand it. This was the only downfall for this particular DVD. I did, however, tried to go through the entire movie attempting to ""encrypt"" the subtitles so that I can understand what's going on. I got the general idea after the movie ended, but I wouldn't want to go through that ordeal again."
3,Acting could've been better,"Took a while to locate a version with English subtitles but found it, although not perfect translation. Song Hye Kyo has always been a great actress and very beautiful but in this role, she looked stiff. I wasn't sure if this was due to the time period this movie portrayed but was disappointed. The movie is very slow so be prepared to have some snacks when watching. Love all the very beautiful landscape and clothing."
2,Definitely written by a mathematician for mathematicians,"This book reminds me of all the reasons I struggled through school trying to comprehend math. Most books then were written like this one, with unending streams of heiroglyphics representing formulas from somewhere in the book, if you could only remember where. A thoughtful use of white space would help and . . . use short sentences! Why writers like to use huge, uncommon words to muddy an already complicated subject is beyond me.After reading and re-reading just two sentences of a chapter I feel somewhat knowledgeable in, I got a headache. The book is hardly practical as it's subtitle indicates. Most will not be able to comprehend it. There are many other more practical and understandable books out there.This is not to say Mr. Eberly knows not what he speaks. He is very well known in these circles. He says he changed careers from being a mathematician to a computer scientist. I only hope he doesn't try to change careers to book writing."
1,Too complicated,"This is not a book for common humans.For understand it you need to be a mathematic scientist! This book use the most difficult mathematic concepts to illustrate simply 3d programming technics. I have bought many other books (real better of this) on this sites and I suggest you to try to find another book. Try using this keywords ""Game Programming"" ,stay sure you'll find what you're looking for."
4,An advanced book for those with the time and the math skills,"If you have lots of time and are comfortable with lots of math notation then this book will reward you with advanced information you can't get anywhere else. I was frustrated with this book because I bought it while working on a project with a tight schedule and I didn't have the time that it required to follow the rigorous derivations. I wanted a ""Gems"" book that could help me right away with the tasks I had. But now that I have more time I am much happier with the book.I have been warned that the code in the book contains many bugs but I cannot yet verify that myself."
3,"This book is not about ""Game Engine Design""","This book is not about ""Game Engine Design"" -- it's about algorithms that you may come across when writing a 3D game engine. There's very little treatment of ""engine design"" in this book.Even though the title is misleading, it's still a great book if you're looking for a reference on 3D game engine algorithms."
4,Don't believe it...,"The title '3D Game Engine Design' is quite misleading. Sure, the book talks about topics such as skinning, texture mapping, etc, but the author has maximum math and minimum code to actually show you how it's done.The author talks about fog, but the closest he comes to showing you how to do it is a long equation that none of us common folk know how to translate into C++. Unless you posess an excessive amount of math degrees, YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND ANYTHING. Sure, he gives you a few code examples, but the book just don't pass muster. For [dollar amount], I think I want my money back.On the other hand, though, the few code examples the author presents are halfway decent. Most of them are little snippets of a module that show you how to implement one technique he talked about. When you get this book in the mail, you're going to flip through it and say...What the???!!!"
1,Doesn't Address the REAL Questions of Game Programming,"Straight math is given; nothing you cannot find in foley/van dam or any decent graphics textbook. It is all very surface level, without ever diving into the serious issues of what makes a good game programmer. So what makes a good game programmer? For one, you should have the ability to evaluate the pros and cons of a given solution to a problem. Unfortunately, this book usually gives one answer to a problem - and even worse, it never touches on the alternatives, pros/cons, or efficiency of the algorithm!The example code is bulky, has poor OO design, slow, and is worthless. The author should use pseudocode in future iterations, and not provide the worthless source (only detrimental in my opinion), or perhaps should consult an OO expert to aide in design."
5,"Finally, right scope for the right price","Best value in market with warranty. Researched all scopes before making final decision. Very pleased with my selection, price, and product performance. Looking forward to taking that trophy buck."
2,Deceptive advertising,"Just like a previous review, I received this scope in the cheaper Nikoplex version rather than the BDC reticle. BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Seven Stars for SEVEN CHALLENGES!!,"This is a great introduction to a gentle yoga style that is perfect for beginners and devotees, alike. The seven challenges are not just an arbitrary construct for the program, but rather a practice for life which is rooted in the Taoist tradition. In addition to the 7 well demonstrated challenges, Ms. Gross does a fine job of outining some important Asian traditions and concepts. Plus, the production values are top notch. All in all, an inspiring yoga DVD."
4,THE DOWN SIDE OF THE MUSIC BIZ!,"Not a romance in the true sense of the word but a look ""inside"" the recording business. Vulgar language abounds but it suits the story. Written like a journal with ""notes to self"" this book follows Jenny Troiani from quitting her job in hopes of becoming a rock star. Her frustrations with finding others who share in her dream, ""using"" people she can't stand to get where she needs to be, and how those around her use her and abuse her."
3,"Easy read , but not her best",I think this novel lacked Ann Rule's normal in-depth look at the victims. I wasn't able to connect with the victims as I have in her other books.
3,better than i thought,When I picked up this book I wasn't expecting much. I thought it would be a typical men-are-dawgs book but it turned out to be much better than that. Reggie the ladies man changes and grows by the end of the book and Neal the married man who's trying to do the right thing in an endearing character.This book is well written and enjoyable. It's not War & Peace and it aint Shakespeare but it's a darn good book. You'll like it.
5,An Excellent Weekend Read,"""Music touches the feelings that words cannont."" - Susan Polis SchulzNot true of Eric E. Pete's page-turning novel. His words grab the reader from the first page and keep them turning till the end and still wanting more. Eric has done a fine job of setting the stage for what happens throughout the book.While somewhat heavy on explicit language and sexual content, Eric's writing style evokes all types of emotions from the reader. You'll find yourself feeling the characters are real and thinking of them days after you're finished with the book.So, if you're looking for a good weekend read ""Someone's in the Kitchen"" is an excellent choice."
5,Eric Put the Sizzle in Summer,"Someone's In the Kitchen is hot and put a sizzle in my summer! The characters have depth and are very entertaining. The story binds you to each of the four characters intimately. The writing flows well and introduces you to all spectrums of emotion. Mr. Pete did not plea the 5th in this story and he ties up all of his loose ends, which is a must for a good read. Pick this book up so you can really see who Mr. Pete has cooking in the kitchen. I guarantee you won't be disappointed."
1,Not Worth The Paper It's Printed On,"This book was trite and horribly written. The concept was good but the execution was lacking. Predictable,lacking artistic vision. Nothing left to the imagination. Lack of a realistic or cohesive ending. Thecharacters were shallow and self-serving. Unconvincing dialogue, no character development.Leave this book at the library on the shelf collecting dust where it belongs."
4,Just Enough Spice,"I enjoyed ""Someone's in the Kitchen"" by Eric E. Pete. The main focus of the story is Reggie and Neal who are close friends. They both live in Houston, TX. Reggie is a ladies man, or a ""dawg"" who is afraid of commitment. Neal is a married man who loves his wife, but his marriage is in trouble. The book opens with a scene that is supposed to give the reader some insight as to why Reggie treats women the way that he does. The author's minor characters are well drawn and interesting. Lila, MeMe, and Shanita are not the stereotypical women characters that you find in most relationship novels. I enjoyed the insight on the friendship between Neal and Reggie. The story kept moving, but toward the end a betrayal takes place that I did not see coming. After that, the ending is kind of rushed. I am looking forward to reading Eric E. Pete's first book, and coming novels. This is a four star novel.Reviewed by Sandra P."
4,wow!,"> WOW!!! when it gets good, it gets good!!!Someone's in the Kitchen is quality work. the characters and actions are real and draw you in. the way eric brings the stories to climax (in more ways than one!), then subtly transitions so well to the end is impressive.before i knew it, i was finished and wanted to keep reading!! it's definitely a page turner with lots of surprisesto the end! i will certainly recommend it to my friends.thanks, eric! keep writing!!"
3,Good READ!!,"I was surprised by the ending and how the entire book came together. It was intresting but I was somewhat disappointed in how Eric Pete didn't elaborate on some of the characters backgrounds and how the ""real"" story with Reggie & his Pops never came all the way out."
4,Just When You Think You've Figured it Out...,"...Eric Pete throws another twist at you. This book made me late for work on several occasions because I had to know what happened next. This book is entertaining, as well as dramatic. You won't believe the outcome! Pick it up!"
5,Drama & Excitement,"If you are looking for drama & excitement, then this book is for you. Every chapter is filled with situations and close calls. I could not put the book down until I finished which was in 2 days. Great Job, Eric."
5,Life revealed in fiction - You have to check it out!,"WOW! What a great writer. ""Someone's in the Kitchen"" is the first novel of Eric Pete's that I had the pleasure of reading. I was surprised at how wrapped up I got in the characters. It was like knowing things about people you weren't supposed to. One of those times, where you overhear something at the office water cooler and cannot wait to share with your closest girlfriends. Enjoyed the realness in the fiction. Had a difficult time putting the book down. You have to check it out... Meanwhile, I'm looking forward to catching up on Mr. Pete's other novels."
1,There are better choices,"Stuffed toys are a fun change of pace for knitters -- smaller pieces, interesting shapes, and (usually) a cute, very cuddly result. The toys in the this book, however, are uninteresting and crude-looking; I really can't see a child warming up to them. If you want toy knitting patterns your money is much better spent on Fiona McTague's ""Knitted Toys"" or Kath Dalmeny's ""World of Knitted Toys."""
2,Disappointing,"My review agrees entirely with an earlier reviewer. This book was not purchased from Amazon.com, I saw it in a bookshop and liked the look of the designs. Although I have not made many knitted toys, I am an experienced knitter. I am at present deciphering my way through the pattern for Loulou the elephant - the pattern has errors and combined with a lack of schematics it is taking a little longer than it should. The only other book I have used for knitted toys is ""The Knitted Teddy Bear"" by Sandra Polley and as it turns out is published by the same publisher. Sandra Polley's book by comparison is a gold mine of instructions, schematics and general help. And so far, no errors. Toys to Knit is another of those books that uses Rowan yarns and why is it that they ALWAYS stipulate far more yarn than is required? Just another sales tool of Rowan Yarns?"
1,Don't Buy This Book,"Do not buy this book. Period. As others have said, the instructions for the teddy bear's head are so far off that only an expert knitter is going to be able to figure it out. I completed this after spending hours recalculating the stitch counts and figuring out which row (I think two are actually missing) needed to be added. The results are adorable, but the hassle isn't worth it.I contacted the publisher, and finally gave up. Those with whom I dealt were a bit on the dim side and couldn't understand what I was telling them regarding the problems with the pattern. The author is apparently British and shares the same name (Tracy Chapman) with a well-known singer, so reaching her is not possible.Again I stress, don't buy this book unless you are an expert knitter and are willing to rewrite the directions to make them accurate."
3,Caution!,"I have to agree with others about this book, though I'm giving it 3 stars because I think some of the toys are cute. THAT SAID, however, I should also say that unless you are an experienced knitter and can outsmart some of the patterns you shouldn't even try any of them. I'm an experienced knitter and have just made Mousie for the second time, scratching my head the whole way for lack of real direction. I finally realized the pattern is vague and the pictures are not helpful. There are no schematics, which would help. I decided to come on Amazon and read the reviews and thought AHA, it's not me, it's the book. Really, as some have said, unless you are willing to spend some time and even rework a pattern I wouldn't bother. There are definitely better toy knitting books out there."
3,Cute but Difficult,"I picked this book up in a bookstore because it looked so cute! I tried the kangaroo first and it worked out surprisingly well as I've never done anything like it before.The elephant is a mess, however. There's a basket of knitted pieces and tangled yarn on a shelf in my closet, and I haven't yet got up the courage to try it again or just through it all out. There are definitly errors in the pattern.The teddy bear I managed to muddle through, although it turned out twice as big as I anticipated. The snake turned out alright as well, with a few modifications.The biggest problem with book is that the directions are not clear, especially when it comes to assembling the toys, and while the photos are beautiful, they don't help show *how* the pieces fit together.I don't regret purchasing the book, but it certainly isn't what I had hoped for. I will definitely be more careful next time I purchase a book like this."
4,Cute knit toys,"I own this book and like the cute animals in it. I have only made a couple of the animals to this point (octopus finger puppet is really cute!), and haven't found any problems with the directions yet. My one issue with the book is that the glossary at the back is incomplete. While I am a relatively confident and experienced knitter, some of the techniques that are used aren't extremely common and should have a basic explanation, but don't. I had to look up a couple of things in another book."
3,Potential in more ways than one!,"Theresa's album took a few listens. Her talent is clearly evident as a vocalist, song-writer and instrumentalist. Once she decides which direction she wants to take her music, then I believe she will be an artist to reckon with. Having seen her live, I can say that the best Theresa Andersson experience is the live one. Pop Diva or Pure American (by way of Sweden)Songwriter? I hope she chooses the latter. This album is definitely worth the investment!Mark, Jacksonville, Fl."
3,gateway book,"I read this book years ago. I remember it having some good content but do not remember that it made much of an impact on me. I also recall being bothered that this book like many others is a ""gateway"" to much more expensive personal consultaions and mentoring. In reading the reviews here I see the vast majority have moved on to that higher level of interaction. Some becoming counselors in this method, thus having an interest in it's success."
5,Life Affirming,"I was first introduced to Tom's book 3 years ago. Since then, I have come to know Tom personally and consider it one of the great blessings of my life to know this man of God. As a certified LifePlanner (TM), I am a witness to a the life altering power contained in this book. I give away 5 or more copies a month. Read it, Live it, Give it away."
5,This book would be a great asset to any library.,"Tom Paterson's ""Living the Life You Were Meant To Live"" has truly hit the mark for life changing strategies and comprehensive facilitation.Pastor William G. Brafford, Jr. Valley Community Church, El Monte, California"
5,Tom Patterson has a gift for the believer in all of us.,"Having spent many hours with Tom Patterson in my working career it is indeed a special event when he reaches out to calm the storms that surround us all as we go through the life God has given us. It is not that he says everything is wonderful and then tells us it is only a matter of our prespective. Instead he tells us how to understand why we feel the way we do and how to accept these feelings as part of God's plan. He does not question, but believes in the eternal hope of mankind. Tom may have saved my marriage, but for sure he saved my relationship with my wife and helped us both to believe that no matter where our lives takes us we will always be better off for having seen each other in a new and different way. Tom Patterson's, ""Living the Life You Were Meant To Live"" is a book for all who are looking for understanding and guidance in marriage. He is a special person with a special message for everyone."
5,Cirque Stuff,"This is a great collection for Cirque fans. You can see the ""progression"" of the quality and professionalism over the years. This is a good collection to have especially for folks not fortunate enough to have seen these 'live'. One DVD allows the viewer to select from different camera angles to watch. Neat addition! Sound and picture quality are very good. Glad I got it............Kevin S"
2,SOLEIL COULD MAKE IT BETTER,"Cirque du Soleil is a great entertainment with color, light, performance and fantasy for adults and kids BUT Solstrom is not ok. What we see in this is not the same as the excellent job on Alegria or Nouba. The stage and light used are mediocre. Even you can see same performance than in live but you do not feel the same. They would get it better after the beautiful job they did on Alegria or Nouba. I do not recommend it."
1,Risking your dog's life with these!,"These are VERY dangerous for your dog. When eaten, these bones become very chewy and sticky and act like glue. Luckily I was supervising my dog with this treat because she started gagging suddenly and had a handful size ball of sticky chewed busy bone stuck to the top of her mouth and she was trying to remove it with her tongue and was gasping for air also. I immediately dislodged the chunk from the roof of her mouth with my finger but I shudder to think about what could happen if you take your eye off of your dog when he/she is eating one of these. The overall sticky consistency when chewed is very hazardous and could cause your dog to choke very quickly. I would recommend supervision at the least or don't even risk the chances of harming your baby with these horrible bones. Yes they taste great to the dog but it's not worth it IMO. If I helped 1 dog owner that is wonderful. Thanks for reading."
1,Made my dog VERY sick!!,"My fiance gave our dog this busy bone yesterday evening, and today our dog has been horribly sick! He keeps throwing up big hard pieces of the bone and had a hard time breathing a few times when pieces were getting stuck in his throat on the way out. HORRIBLE product, and very dangerous. I can't believe Purina can sell these with a clear conscious."
1,Horrible,Why did they make this movie? they completly ruined the first one. When the spider is crawling on the side of the ship you can tell the ship is a model and that the spider is just a normal spider. The deaths are boring. The actors are boring. The effects are so cheap. Why didn't they use the effects from the first one? In some scenes when the spider is running down a hallway you can tell its footage from the frist one. I was so glad when it was over. Do not buy or even rent this movie. I would give it o stars but it doesn't let you pick that. NOT RECOMMENDED! 0 STARS!
1,"if you liked the first one, don't plan to like this one!!","I knew when I saw that this movie didn't have ANY of the same actors in it that the first one did, it was probably pretty bad. ""Spiders"" at least had some charm and some good special effects, but since this ""sequel"" movie has unlikable characters and quite cartoony special effects, it's hard to get into or enjoy. It has absolutely nothing to do with the first one and Richard Moll stars in it. That should be all you need to know to stay away from this piece of dreck!!"
1,my oh my,"what are people thinking when they make a film anyways? the first spiders was actually a pretty good movie but then they make a complete disaster here in the sequeal, i mean just terrible, good god what happened?? one scene it looks like toy spiders crawling on a boat made from legos or somethin, i mean just terrible. nothing realistic looking at all in this film. i wouldn't pay a penny for this flick. its just that bad people!"
2,Its very forgettable,"There's nothing in this film to make it memorable. At the same time, however, it's not bad enough to be memorable either.One different thing though is that it takes place on a boat on which scientists are conducting some manner of experiments, resulting in title creatures. The heroes are a couple who end up on this boat because... I don't remember...This does present one problem though. Aside from the leads, everyone else is a ""bad guy"", so... it doesn't take a lot of imagination to figure out how things work out in the end.,"
2,Why Spiders 2 Sucked ass,"The first Spiders was great it really kept me on the edge of my seat and I have to say that the monster was well created. But this movie was horrible you never hear any thing about the spiders until the middle of the film and when you do actually see the spiders it is on a huge boat. OK huge spiders on a huge boat, that's about as bad as you can get it's so fake. They should have gone back to the jungle like they did in the first spiders"
2,Good Queen Bess?,"I'd love to be able to give this book a five star rating, since conceptually it is just what so many parents need to fortify their children's education.But anyone who would call Elizabeth I ""England's Greatest Queen"" has a decidedly Protestant, ""Whig"" view of history. Christian readers should know that ""Good Queen Bess"" formalized her father Henry VIII's violent separation of England from its historic ties to Christianity and made martyrs and outlaws of the realm's leading intellectual lights, e.g., Edmund Campion, William Allen, etc.It kills me to give a project with such a noble ambition a paltry two stars, but the last thing we need is another set of history books lionizing one of history's great despots."
3,CD's - To Play or Not to Play,"I ordered this product for our family to listen to during road trips. However, the CD's will not play in my car's CD player. I ended up having to load them into my iTunes account on my computer, download them to my iPhone and play them through this device. A little more trouble than what I expected. Otherwise, great listening material. Did like the narrator from the Volume 1 set better than the vol. 2 group."
2,"History, but not very exciting.",I thought I would purchase the audio book so my son could listen to it in the car. I have heard so much about Jim Weiss. Many have recommended his audio books to me. I felt that the the reading of the book was boring. I found it to be very monotone. It definitely does not catch my attention at all. Next time I will just purchase the book.
3,Story of the World,"I'd forgotten that my Vol. 1 was the revised edition, so I was disappointed when I realized I'd ordered the original edition of Vol. 2. Still good content but not nearly as kid-friendly as the revision."
5,Excellent summaries for elementary age students,"Whether you are a home school parent looking for a good history resource or a parent or teacher looking for a supplement to your child's education, this book is a great reference. It presents history in chronological order, covering important historical events in most areas of the world in short 5-10 page summaries. The narrative writing style and pictures that supplement the prose make the subject appealing to students of all ages."
2,Interesting information can't stand the voice though,"This has a lot of interesting information. It made it interesting for my kids to learn. I've got to say I am not fond of Jim Wiess's reading style. His method of emphasis is annoying, he puts me to sleep, and he sounds like he's got a wad of chewing gum in his mouth - like he's trying to sound like Mr. Howell on Gilligan's Island. It was maddening to me."
1,boring,"Game is boring! No action, no adventure! Just plain old poker. You only need a deck of inexpensive playing cards and a friend to play poker. Not some expensive actionless video game."
3,"Ok, but not realistic","Unfortunately many of these games are not realistic. The only way to get that kind of experience is in a real cardroom or playing online. If you are going to play online, make sure you visit a site like www.gotbonus.com for more information."
1,horrible gameplay,"if you know anything about poker you will hate this game...players bet and call seemingly at random even on the ""professional level"". I didnt try the online mode but there is the possibility that it could be better against live opponents...i play real money poker on a daily basis and the only thing this has in common are the cards...7 card stud doesnt even have the correct betting structure...if you are looking for a good poker game....look elsewhere...your money is better spent if you trade it in for chips..."
5,The wonderful book,"This book is about that spencer and zack. They spencer had zack sleep over and zack had a book that was called I'm out of my body. They were going to sleep and zack,""said do you want to tryto go out of your body. spencer said,"" YES"" okay let's go so that is why this is a wonderful book."
2,Vent Shade,"This product DOES NOT fit any Rangers that have felt strips between the window channels. Do not go by the Advertisement. For those who own late model Rangers from 01 to 07 whose edges come finished with FELT strips, do not order this as the adhesives WILL NOT stick to FELT material"
5,"An incisive, informative and entertaining read","This work is a must-read for any executive with direct responsibility for shaping public perception of their company and any attorney who must navigate a court system that has, like it or not, become increasingly media-driven.In The Court of Public Opinion features an engaging mix of real-world examples and solid communications strategy. Mr. Haggerty provides a clear and decisive action plan that can be adapted to almost any litigation situation, and offers examples of common mistakes that both attorneys and executives make in the face of media scrutiny. His style is engaging and entertaining, making the book a fun, fast read. Highly recommended!"
5,I like it,"As with the Box Wave screen protector I bought for my Kindle Fire, this one for the ipad went on easily with no bubbles and it does cut the glare. I'll be buying one for my ipad mini from them if they make one."
2,"Nice Non-Glare, But Tore after 1 Month","I purchased this on 04/01/11 after rave reviews by a techie brother and by 04/20/11, I had a tear in the middle of the screen. I can live with the tear, but found that I had more bubbles under the protector.While the other reviewer said it was a poor fit, I did not have that problem; it fit nicely, with a 1mm-2mm gaps around all edges. That gap is negligible.It's now been five months since the purchase. All in all, it's a pretty good fit, I love the non-glare screen protector. My only disappointment is that it tore."
2,"Sally Hansen Eyebrow, Face & Lip Wax Microwaveable","The packaging of this product was deceptive, because the plastic container it came in had a false bottom. The amount of wax contained therein was less than a quarter of an inch, whereas the actual jar it came in was 3 inches at least. This fact made me irritated and the product has not lasted very long. Before I bought this item, I had another container of microwavable brow remover that lasted me 20 years there was so much wax in it.The wax does not work well either and I have put it on my lip and it will not take off all the hair, even though I have very fine blonde hair. I have put the wax on after it has been heated for the 3rd time and will see if this will finally remove all the hair on my lip? Well, I just finished pulling the dry wax off - and again it did not take off all of the hair. Don't know why, but although it is inexpensive, I am going to buy some more brow wax from another company as soon as I am finished with this review."
1,Wax did not melt.,"I microwaved the wax in this eyebrow waxing kit for the recommended 90 seconds, but the wax remained as hard as plywood, so I went ahead and microwaved it for two minutes, which the instructions listed as the maximum time the wax should be microwaved. The wax was still just as hard as it had been before I ever put in the microwave, so I zapped it some more. Still did not change. It may have been just a fluke defect, but I'm going back to having my brows done at the salon, and I definitely won't be buying this product or any similar Sally Hansen product again. What a waste of money!"
2,ehhhh,"Not bad, but it ripped my skin off and does not peal off easily at all! It also hardens back really fast too. On top of that it is REALLY messy and sticky. The cream it comes with isn't bad, but it has an unpleasant sent. The tweezers it comes with are like 3 cm long to... like why would I use this? It did get the excess hair off my brows but it wasn't worth it and it could have been better."
1,Try the waxing strips instead,"I've used waxing products from this brand a couple times, mostly waxing strips. I heard that actual wax, however, was supposed to work better and keep hair from growing back for a longer period of time. Yeah right. I really can't recommend this stuff at all. I followed the directions very carefully, but wound up with a huge mess. The wax got stuck to my fingertips and wouldn't come off for hours. And might I mention that it didn't work at all? I think the wax took off a grand total of four hairs, if even that. Hardly did a thing. So, yeah, this stuff really isn't worth your money at all. On the other hand, their waxing strips work very nicely."
3,Lacking quality,The packaaging is now diffferent. The container seems a bith smaller. The contents do not seem to last as long and the wax doesn't seem to maintain its consistency. Not too happy. May searc for another brand.
1,Doesn't work & waste of money,"This is the first facial wax I bought here in the US and it's by far the worst I've ever used. It takes a good 15-20 mins on high heat to melt, does not stick properly to the skin, and does NOT remove any hair. I was completely frustrated by the end of it. I have a facial waxing kit I brought from India that I will be using for a while but not sure what I'll do when that runs out. I won't be buying this one for sure...total waste of money! I'd recommended not to even bother with it."
1,Horrible,"I tried to use this wax, but when I did (after following all directions correctly) it ended up stuck on my skin. The wax hadn't even had 3 seconds to cool before it was stuck. It hurt! It took a while for me to finally peel it off. The only people who like it are those who have been using it for a while (and have practice with it) - and even they have had problems with it! Won't ever buy a Sally wax product again because of this."
5,"Great wax, with practice","I have used this wax for years. I love that you don't need strips for it. It works so well and is awesome in general. That being said, I do have some tips for those who seem to hate the product:1. You really need to microwave that bad boy for wayy longer than 1 minute. I always microwaved it until it is liquid2. When you microwave it that much, make sure you blow on it when it's on the applicator to cool it down before applying to your skin3. Apply in small sections, and use more wax than you think you should4. DO NOT wait until it is totally cool to pull it off. If you do, it will not come off and it's a pain to remove... someone else said baby oil, I haven't tried that, but I will in the future.Anyway, I do love this wax, hate strips. Can't find this anywhere in stores, but I don't really want to buy it from Amazon b/c of the cost of shipping either way, a great product and I will keep looking for it."
1,Horrible Product,What a waste of time and money. The wax never became soft enough to spread and the only thing the wax stuck to was the wand. Save yourself the trouble and try something else.
1,Messy! Worthless! Not Worth Trying!,"I decided to try this product for my eyebrows because I thought I can't really lose anything. If it works once the cost is less than a salon. The problem was it didn't work even once! I followed the directions closely. The wax doesn't melt in the time the directions say (and my microwave is normally very powerful). It's hard to spread...if you get it to thin it won't pull off..too thick leaves bits of it behind. For some reason it really tucked my skin, but plucked very few hairs. I also wouldn't trust the indicator wand to not burn you. Placing it in the hottest part of the wax it continued to show ""ready"". The tweezers are Barbie sized and don't work well at that. The soothing lotion is OK, but the kit includes nothing to clean off the goo with. I don't think I would have ever gotten it off my fingers if I hadn't had some wax remover from a different kit."
1,Gah!!,"So i just bought this product, just to try it and see if it actually worked. I got home and was excited to play with my new toy. I tried to put it in my microwave, but sparks started flying! I was horrified, especially since they claim that the container is microwave safe. Just to be sure it wasn't just my microwave acting up, i put a cup of water in it, and nothing happened. I tried the container of wax again, and the sparks flew once again. So i cannot tell you if this product works, because i can't even heat it up to try it.Sally Hansen Eyebrow, Face & Lip Wax, Microwaveable"
1,terrible wax,"I bought this wax to see if it would be easier to use than the wax strips. Well I was shocked at how bad it is. They should pull it from the market. The only reason I would even consider giving this even one star, is because I do really like the soothing cream. It is soo nice because it numbs the area after so there is no burning. But the wax sucks. It was messy, didn't melt right, way too hot in some spots, very hard to get off, and the hair that does come off is an insult. Waste of time and money."
1,HORRIBLE WASTE OF MONEY!,A total waste of money. Does NOT WORK!!! The box instructs to heat in microwave for 90 secs. An even after 15 MINUTES IT WAS STILL ROCK HARD!!
1,Faulty Monitors!!!,"I bought this to use a baby montior since all other wireless ones had interference. After drilling holes in my floor to run the wires, in ONE week, the monitor went out on this product! Amazon replaced it NEXT day and in one week THAT monitor went out!!! And it had a funny electrical smell when it blew. Fire Hazard!! I would not waste my time with purchasing this item!!"
1,not so good,purchased 1 unit it smoked within 2 days. was replaced via svat and second unit would not even turn on.. i would say a quality issue on this item
5,Pathology: Implications for the Physical Therapist,"The book came in perfect condition and was exactly as I ordered it. I received it in a decent amount of time, and have good experience with my orders on Amazon."
5,Pathology:Implications for the physical therapist,A very useful book. Probably the one I consult most often. Great reviews of many conditions/disorders with frequently helpful guidelines for practice. Worth the money!
1,Sour Grapes,"It never ceases to amaze me how many people in this world blame their problems on everybody else, never looking for the way through, only the way out or around. The statement in the ""official"" review of this book that Alan Ladd could not read a script is probably the most ridiculous thing I've ever read, and proves that this man did not know Mr. Ladd at all. I did. And the stench of sour grapes is permeating this memoir of a frustrated, scapegoat-needing fool so badly that I don't care to read it--ever.Call me overly sensitive, but when an idiot insults a friend--especially by writing a tainted story about him--what person will not stand up and defend their loved one?"
4,Great introductory DVD for beginners and players of moderate skill.,"I have been playing racquetball for the last couple of years, intermittently. Maybe 1-2 times a month. So I still consider myself a beginner. I found this DVD very useful. It starts off with the very fundamentals, such as stance and grip, and moves on to some advanced strokes and serves. The coach has an easy relaxed style, the quality of filmmaking is decent. I just wish they showed the shots from different views and angles."
5,Love Series,these DVD's came timely. They are a great series and my daughters and I have enjoyed watching them. If you love good quality family movies these are definately the ones to see.
5,Great service,"Good transaction - quick, reliable and well packaged. I would buy again from this company and do not hesitate to recommend to anyone else."
5,Love Comes Softly Collection,Love the series but has taken up space on my DVR. Now I can free up the space to record other shows/events.
5,Great for the whole family!,"I find it really hard these days to find love stories that the whole family can enjoy. These are the kind of movies that little kids can watch, without parents having to worry about cussing or graphic sex scenes. Sometimes the lines the actors say can be really cheesy, but I think that is a small price to pay, because the stories are excellent!"
5,great service!,The dvd set came very quickly and and was packaged great with no bends or tears - in spite of the occasional abuse by the gov't snail mail folks. We did not open it since it will be a Christmas gift.
5,wonderful,got this for my mother in law she supe enjoyed it and so did other in the family. a great set to have in your home library and what over and over
3,Complete love come softly collection,"Great story line for those who like Christian based romance, or little house on the prairie style film. It was a shame the person in successive DVD's didn't look like the person in the previous one of the same character, but otherwise a good collection. Please be aware that amazon put the actual cost value of the set rather than the replacement value of the DVD's and this caused a hefty unexpected customs bill...."
3,Not True to Size :(,"Although this pan is a very nice, sturdy, heavy weight, it's NOT really a 9x13. The base of the pan, measured on the outside, is 8x11.5 inches. The top outer rim of the pan is 9x13. So if you're looking for a true 9x13, this isn't it! I haven't baked with it yet, so can't attest to how evenly it bakes."
4,Good pan for baking but the lid is not secure,I bought this pan because it was a heavy duty aluminum that would prevent too much browning on cakes and so far it has done that well. What I don't like about the pan is the lack of a handle and the lid. The lid fits on loosely and is not secure at all. I would have preferred a latch system that turns the whole thing into a carrier. The aluminum gets scratchy easily too. The first time I took a soft sponge to it the finish already got scratched.
5,good pan,I bought this pan because it has no lip on it and will fit in my toaster over. It works well and cleans up easily.
3,Not the best quality,The top melted after I left it on the stove when the oven was on. The pan is fine but the top is now useless.
4,Great Picture Book,Wonderful photos in this book that often tell more about Bourke-White than the narritive. Not much depth here but a great coffee-table book.
2,Not good prepared,"You can find all chapters taken from revealnet (now: quest) oracle knowleadge expert program, which evaluation version you can download for free. Explenations in the book are not clear. Do not try to use this book for preparation for Oracle8i exam - it will be waste of money. Many parameters are made obsolete in Oracle 8i, which this book describe. Moreover - there are mistakes (eg: how you call tkprof?). My advice: search for something else."
5,DBA Performance Tuning,This book is great for studying and will be a great future reference for commands seldomly used.
1,poor quality control,"I bought one of these armoires in black walnut directly from Home Decorators. The doors don't line up. At least one dowel hole was missing at the top and I had to remove another that didn't line up. I have assembled a lot of flat-pack furniture without trouble, so I can only attribute this to bad quality control. How do you let parts through the manufacturing line without completing the dowel holes?"
2,"""Faith""ful listeners beware!","I love country music and I love Faith Hill. However, this CD is very disappointing! My only warning is for you Faith Hill lovers who want to buy the CD without listening to it first - please don't. I would not have bought this CD had I listened to it first. I have all of Faith's other CDs and absolutely LOVE them. Based on that, I went out and bought this CD the first day it was available because I thought for sure I would love it like the rest. Boy, was I fooled!"
4,Still a hot album to this day.,"Faith Hill's Breathe album is still a good album to this day. While I've heard Breathe maybe 156 times on the radio, in stores, and other places within the past 5 years, the rest of the album is quite good. I like the opening song that clocks in at 5:36, a rarity in a country genre that tends to opt for shorter songs. I like Let's Make Love with Tim McGraw, If I Should Fall Behind, If There Was a Way and others. Since he's known to do rock albums, I like that Mike Shipley helped do the mixing on this album. Anything Shipley does makes the albums sound good and he does it on Faith's. Most people dismiss this album as a pop album, but this is undoubtedly country in its themes and songs, the way Faith sings them and interprets them.A very finely done album from her!"
2,not so impressed,"I don't understand the faith following. She is an okay singer who is overrated and overexposed. She lacks roots, to me. Her songs lack the depth and quality of a Trisha, Martina, or Reba so I don't even put her in their category of awesome."
3,It's OK...,"As a die hard country music fan, I must say I was disappointed at the venerable lack of country sound. I found only four tracks on this CD that I would listen to more than once--Breathe, It Will Be Me, The Way You Love Me and If I'm Not In Love. To her credit, although If I'm Not In Love is as far from country that you can get, if you like torch songs, Faith Hill did a great job here. It's moving, haunting, and you get the impression it was heartfelt as well as a physically enjoyable song to sing. It's simple and it says it. But my favorite is The Way You Love Me. Whoever did the arranging was fantastic! The backup vocals are as much fun as the melody. I'm glad I bought it. I just wish there had been more songs on it that ""spoke"" to me."
4,I Love It!,"I think this CD will win Faith Hill fans over and gain some new ones in the area of pop. The song ""Breathe"" makes you do just that! It is sinfully beautiful. The cover of Springsteen's ""If I Should Fall Behind"" is gutsy of her and she masters it. Also, it is nice to see a man and wife sing together and prove their love to the world! I love this CD. I hope I get it for Christmas!"
3,Faith is okay,"I like this cd, just not very much. Faith is always compared to Shania like they are rivals. Well, Shania wins. While Faith is a much better vocalist, her music choices are spotty at best. I like ""the way you love me"" and a few others, such as that Elvis song. Way too many slow songs, and that duet with Tim is just horrid, he has one of the worst voices yet. If I wanted to hear Tim Mcgraw, I would have bought one of his cd's."
4,The country vs. pop battle rages on,"Faith has already seen huge crossover success with ""This Kiss"" (from the Faith CD), and now ""Breathe"" and ""The Way You Love Me"" from this CD. Add ""If My Heart Had Wings"" to the list. Well, not officially, but her newest single on country radio is destined to hit pop radio. I am not saying it is a bad thing that Faith is crossing over, in fact more power to her.I find myself skipping around this CD a lot, not skipping songs in particular, just putting them in what I feel is the correct order, because as they appear seems a little out of sync (maybe it's just me).""Let's Make Love"" is the token Faith/Tim duet on this CD. I am glad Tim and Faith are happily married, but enough of the duets on each others albums. Just release a full-length duets CD already!!"
4,Country Music is Changing!,"Country music is changing greatly. In the past ten years, we have seen a shift to a more pop style of singing. Remember the old days of Stompin' Tom and Conway Twitty? That country no longer exists. We cannot blame Faith for her new album sounding more like a pop disc. We have to blame country music in general. She is just doing what all other singers are doing. Even Martina McBride's new album (Emotion) is closer to pop than previous albums of hers. Besides, ""Breathe"" is a great album and Faith deserves all the success it has made to this point."
2,A disapointed fan from a country lover,This is by far the worst Faith Hill cd yet. Each cd she was inching closer and closer to pop. If you like the songs Breathe and The Way You Love Me buy the singles. If you really want Faith Hill buy her first three albums. They're excellent.
1,You can have my cd!,"Terrible! I love Faith Hill, and I am not going to give up on her, but this cd is horrible. I am a country music fan, but I also like many other different types of music. It doesn't matter what label you put on it,pop or country, it is just bad music. Rather than waste your money on this cd buy any one of her other cds. They are all great. This is very dissapointing!"
1,It was okay,"I guess when I bought the Breathe cd, I expected it to be like her previous cds. Nope. I can't say its the worst cd in my collection. Her husband has that honor. It has a few okay songs.I don't even know why they still call it country though. It sounds pop to me. Why do they call it country-pop? Country is one set of music. Pop is another kind of music.Save your money on this one too."
2,Breath by Faith Hill,"If your looking for country music, don't buy this album! While Breath is a good pop album, it is a poor country album. I bought this expecting to find the same soulful voice of ""It Matters to Me"" and ""Take Me As I Am"". What I found was Faith trying to compete with Brittany Spears and Shania Twain in the Pop world. I hope her next album is either truly a country album or she labels it correctly. This album has no business with the word ""country"" anywhere near it! If, however, you like pop music, it would ge a good buy."
1,the worst album,"Firstly, i don't like her. Her music is bad, her voice is terrible. Secondly, she is only the copy of Shania Twain. If you like country-pop music, you should choose Shania. Shania is the one in country music.You can also interested in Trisha Yearwood , Dixie Chicks, LeAnn Rimes. Don't buy her album ."
2,Where's Faith?,I love Faith Hill and have all of her albums--but this one isn't true to her style and emotion. It tries too hard to be Shania-like and along the way her vocals are wasted on rocker songs with repetitive lyrics. I was disappointed after waiting so long for this one to come out.
1,Disappointing - Gone from great to too-much,I cannot believe this is the same Faith Hill...she is on the edge and the music is uneven and does not show off her great voice like her other music did...fame may have destroyed yet another star
4,I Love It!,"I think this CD will win Faith Hill fans over and gain some new ones in the area of pop. The song Breathe makes you do just that! It is sinfully beautiful. The cover of Springsteen's If I Should Fall Behind is gutsy of her and she masters it. Also, it is nice to see a man and wife sing together and prove their love to the world! I love this CD. I hope I get it for Christmas!"
1,Ack!,"As much as I tried to like this CD, it just didn't happen. I give the CD one star just for ""Breathe"" which is the only good song here. Faith, hon, it's not your voice, it's the songs. They are redundant, tired, and an overall slap in the face to true country music albums."
5,TOTALLY AWESOME FAITH!,"Faith has a terrific voice and I don't care if she doesn't sing just country songs. Are you a fan of Faith's or a fan of country music? Faith has one of the best voices I have ever had the pleasure of hearing and her new album shows the range of her voice. I love the selection of songs on ""Faith"" and the more I listen to the album the more I love it. Keep up the good work Faith."
1,I've been duped!,"A very disappointing purchase. ""Breathe"" is the only track worth listening too, which isn't saying much. Shania Twain's country pop effort knocks this one into a cocked hat ....Anyone want a cheap CD?"
2,A Countryless Album,"Faith Hill has a beautiful voice, that is a given. Her TV appearances indicate that she is a sincere artist. Her previous two albums are among my favorites. But this new album does not contain country songs. There is no consistency in the songs on the album. Some songs are musically pleasing but have inane lyrics, while others just don't sound good at all. Is the song ""Breathe"" about a doctor using his stethoscope? Regarding the next song, I thought people slept all night long. I'll admit that I like ""If I'm Not in Love"" and will buy her next album if it is more like her previous work."
1,Faith Hill .........Jumped the Shark,What a turkey recording. Faith and Lee Ann Womack both jumped the shark with their latest releases.
2,Incredibly dissapointing,"I am one of Faith Hill's greatest fans, I own every cd she has ever put out, and I absolutely love ever one, except Breathe. When I heard that Faith's new album was coming out I couldn't wait to get it. Luckily I won a free copy on the radio, because I would hate myself for paying money for this horrible cd. There is not a single decent song, and I am very, very disapointed, this cd is so lame that it may have turned me off from Faith's music from now on. I can tell you I won't be in a hurry to buy her next cd. If you ask me, Faith is trying a little to hard to cross-over, as are Martina and Shania."
1,"Faith, don't try to be Shania! We like your country voice!","I first started listening to Faith Hill when I heard ""Piece of My Heart"" about 5 years ago. Since then, I have been disappointed in her career. I liked ""It Matters to Me"" and even ""Faith"" was okay, although different. Faith has tried to become too glamorous instead of the cute country girl she used to be. I was really shocked to hear this CD--it doesn't even sound like her voice! She used to be a little twangy, not too much but just enough. Suddenly she is trying to sound like Shania Twain. She uses the same kind of intonation, which she NEVER used to do. I hope her next album goes back to her country roots--don't try to be Shania! You are a star in your own right, Faith!"
2,Speechless,My wife and I believe FaithHill is 2nd best. We think that her voice is one in amillion. Breathe CD was topof the world. But she wentpast he point of rescue onthe video called Breathe.She sunk to the bottom. What's next faith? A showall on the WWF.
1,Faith forsakes country,"With great disappointment, I labored through this newest CD from Faith Hill. Until now, she had been the favorite female country artist of my wife and mine but no more. I don't know where this tripe will get airtime, although there probably are enough pseudo-country stations that will play some of its songs. The problem is that outside of her duet with husband Tim, there just isn't another passable song on the entire disc. Here's hoping Faith comes to her senses and returns to singing country because this material isn't going to cut it in either genre."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY!,I CANNOT BELIEVE SOMEONE AS TALENTED AS FAITH HILL IS CAN PUT OUT MUSIC LIKE THIS. THERE ISN'T A SINGLE SONG ON THIS CD THAT WOULD MAKE IT WORTH SPENDING YOUR MONEY. I HAVE ALL OF FAITH'S CD'S AND I HAVE TO SAY THAT I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS EFFORT. SAVE YOUR MONEY!
4,Faith Hill can actually sing!,"I've never really cared for Faith, until I heard Breathe. It is a beautiful song and for the first time on a CD, she is actually singing,(in most parts) and not yelling. If this is any indication of her future music, I just may become a Faith Hill fan."
3,"nice, after all...","I got to say that I've always loved Faith so much (and still do!) but although I like the most of the the songs she chose for BREATHE, I think she should've remained closer to her previous albums. Well, I like BREATHE, but I don't like the fact the she turned her back to country music!"
1,Shocked,"I purchased the CD. I own other CD's by Faith Hill.The best way to evaluate satisfaction is to ask the question: ""If you had another chance to order the CD being evaluated, would you order the CD. My reply is no. The voice and the background music do not sound like the Faith Hill that I hear in the CD's that I own."
5,Won't Come Out Of The CD Player,"Maybe it's not the ""normal"" country, but every song on this CD was great! I thought Faith's voice sounded strong, sure of herself, and upbeat. She has grown so much musically in the last few years. For any country fan, this CD is a must!"
1,WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!,I am so disappointed in this cd. I couldn't wait for it to come out i ordered my advance copy. i've had it a while now trying to see if there was some song that would grow on me enough to recommend this cd but it never happened. The only song on this cd I like is The Way You Love Me which is reminiscent of This Kiss. And what was she thinking about when she recorded Bringing Out The Elvis? What a terrible song. I wish Faith would go back and listen to her first 2 cd's and try to get back that magic. This cd is TERRIBLE!
5,"Great pop cd, but lacks country elements!","I have always been a big Faith Hill fan, she is a very beautiful artist, and shoots impressing videos, but lately her sound in this recording is not really country at all. It is more of a blend of pop, rock, soul and gospel. ""Breathe"" is a great song, well sung and with a breathtaking video. ""The Way You Love Me"" is a good techno/pop song, ""If my heart has wings"" is a very powerful vocal performance, ""What's in it for me"" is a nice, lengthy song, ""Bringing out the Elvis"" is a good tribute to the ""King"" and one of my favorites in the album is ""It will be me,"" a strong ballad. I like Faith Hill's duet with Tim McGraw, ""Let's make love."" The gospel song ""There will come a day"" is a sad song, well sung. Good listening to it after September 11th. This CD is good for pop, rock and gospel listeners, but for country listeners still to Faith Hill's older CDs, such as ""Take Me as I Am,"" ""It Matters to Me"" and ""Faith."""
4,A Breath of Fresh Air,"Faith Hill is beautiful, and so is this CD. Each one of these songs is passionate, romantic, and simply breathtaking. Don't think you have to like country music to like Faith Hill, fans of all genres would do well to listen to her music. It's straight from the heart."
5,Breathe Rules!,I have got to say that this is the best cd Faith Hill has ever recorded! I usually only like a couple of songs on a cd but this one I love all of them! You have to change on each album-Faith did change but in a good and postive way! You should not compare Faith to other artist. she is being who she is and what she sings is what she likes and I think it is doing well for her! You should all go and buy the new cd! You will not regret it! This cd is going to be a big seller! You go Faith!
5,Faith has done it again!,"Once again, Faith Hill has not let us down. I bought the CD the other day and can't stop listening to it. This album provides a little of everything: pop, country, rock, and christian. I think that at least half if not all the songs will become number one hits."
5,great!,"ok all you former faith fans, do you only like country music or do you like faith? i am a big fan of hers, whether it's more on the pop or country side. it's music that's all that matters to me. this just isn't music, it's wonderful, soul seaching music that is a pleasure to listen to!"
3,A few good songs...,"are on this CD. The first 4 tracks and song #7. The rest isn't much, but the good tracks still make up for what the other lack."
3,Not Country,"If you like country songs this C.D. isn't for you. If you like pop and rock then this is the perfect C.D. Faith Hill is a good singer but they shouldn't have classified her singing and music as country. It is a big lie. This is still a pretty good C.D. As I said before though, if you're a country fan and don't like pop and rock you'd be wasting your money on this C.D."
4,Good!,"This is the only Faith Hill CD i have, so i don't really have anything to compare it to. But i think it's a pretty good cd...""Bringing out the Elvis"" is annoying and some of the songs start to sound the same after awhile, but a couple of the songs are really beautiful! My faves are: 1)Breathe 2)It Will Be Me 3)Let's Make Love 4)If I'm Not In Love With You 5)If My Heart Had WingsI think this album sounds more like a pop one than a country one but overall i'd definitely recommend buying it."
3,Innocuous pop,"It's obvious Faith Hill has had some voice training--the twang heard on her first few albums is completely gone. And record companies know the first thing to get rid of when marketing a country singer for the pop market is the twang. Okay, the twang's gone, so Faith gets herself some pleasant if forgettable ballads, a couple uptempo things, the obligatory duet with the country star hubby, and voila! A pop smash. And of course the blond, blue-eyed cover girl looks don't hurt, either. I don't think she'll be a Celine or Shania-type pop star, but like many singers with a limited range, she does okay with what she has. If she or her producers chose more songs like the Bruce Springsteen-penned ""If I Should Fall Behind,"" she might even be taken seriously (she does very well with songs in the lower range). Overall, a very typical pop album, nothing special."
2,Troubled,"I don't know; I'm troubled by the abrupt shift in Hill's career, from a country nice girl to a pop vamp. Maybe if it hadn't happened overnight, or maybe if it hadn't happened in light of Shania Twain's similar and more successful transformation . . . Anyway, I just find her to be artificial and a little too Big Business now to enjoy. And really, it should be official now that Hill is a pop star and not country; she shouldn't be nominated for any more country awards or have her songs played on country stations. This is pop music, regardless of where she came from. (Similarly, I will never forget walking into a Christian bookstore a few years ago and hearing Amy Grant singing ""Big Yellow Taxi"" on the loudspeakers. Would a Christian bookstore ever play Joni Mitchell's own version of the same song?)"
2,Very disappointing.,"I bought this CD after hearing the beautiful title song, but I was very disappointed. There is only maybe one other song on the whole CD worth listening to. Faith is trying too hard to steal Shania Twain's thunder (with her new sexed-up look and attempts at sounding ""poppy""). I much prefer her unique sound on ""Take Me As I Am"" CD. She is such a naturally beautiful woman, but it seems like she's trying so hard to be someone she's not. Just be yourself, Faith...you're much more appealing that way!"
3,Don't listen to it when driving z-z-z-z,"Where is the Faith of old? The one whose albums were admittedly somewhat inconsistant but always energetic and fun? After listening to this lethargic album I thought, ""This is the girl who sang 'Wild One' and 'Take me as I am'?""""Breathe"" is a very pretty song, granted. But Faith hitting the low notes is nothing compared to Faith with energy and verve.Mountain Dew, Faith. High Caffeine High Sugar. You need it. Heck, I need it after dozing off after three of these slo-mo songs. By the middle of the album I felt like I was treading water in mush."
5,Is it possible to wear out a CD?,"This latest release from Faith Hill confirms that she is one of the premiere country artists. What I most like about her music is that she makes country accessible to others. Who are we to begrudge her crossover success, anyway? I once had my own pre-conceived notion about ""country music"" until artists like Faith, the Dixie Chicks and Garth Brooks started crossing over to pop music. Now I know what all the fuss is about! This CD is filled with energy and passion. Not one song is a disappointment. And she delivers each song with a purity and sincerity that is amazing -- what a voice!"
5,Fantastic,The duet with Tim McGraw was fascinating and the other ballads she sings are just amazing. I can't wait to buy the cd.
1,not even worth 1 star,"I agree totally with the reviewers who disliked this album. I HATED this album, to say the least. True country is not about a face and pop music; it's about music that comes from your origins, your family, especially if you're a southerner, like I am. The people who bought this album only did so because it had a face on it, not because it's true talent. This bimbo has a voice to make the devil cringe in disgust; hoarse and raspy.....""I cann feeeeeeeeeel you breathhhhhhe cough cough cough.""Not even worth a penny."
1,An embarrassment,"This cd should be considered an embarrassment. Listening to Faith try to hit notes out of her range and try to incorporate a new style that she hasn't exactly embraced or feels comfortable with made me cringe. I can understand and appreciate someone who wants to expand their horizon, but please--don't become something you're not!"
3,Very slow CD,"I listened to this CD twice so far and it is ok. Aside from Faith's big hit, ""Breathe"" and a few other fast tracks (i.e. ""Bringing out the Elvis"", the majority of the CD is rather slow. I didn't think Faith's voice sounded very impressive on this CD. I think she has a wonderful voice but this CD just didn't showcase her real ability. It's the kind of CD you forget is on because it doesn't draw you in. Also, this CD is more country than her other (""Cry"") so it depends on what type of music you prefer but I would recommend her other CD, ""Cry"" which is the complete opposite. It draws you in from the first note of the first track. But again, I am more of a pop than a country fan if I had to choose but I like the cross-over artists like Faith and Shania Twain."
5,A great mix of country and pop!,"I LOVE this album! I originally bought it for ""Breathe"" but I have found that every song is incredible!"
3,not a bad cd,It seems mrs mcgraw wants more pop hits. This is not really a country cd. Once again she surrounds herself with good material. The tender title song and If im not in love with you sound like well crafted crossover hits. GOOD production by her producers once again and to please her fans another duet with Mr MCGRAW. she is doing better but i think she can do a little better.
4,Different than Faith's first few albums..but still great!,"There's more to this album than others in the past. There's the typical love songs and all, but there's less of a country sound in her more up beat tunes. She's coming out of her shell and finding herself singing songs more ""now"" and less ""early 90's country"". It's a definite must have!"
2,Blanding Out,"This is a disapointment from someone who started off with such a promising career. Faith Hill seems to have prioritized pop crossover success over actually recording good songs. This album tries to appeal to a very broad audience by not doing anything original or specific. ""I Love The Way You Love Me""...""Let's Make Love""...that's about as original as the songwriting ideas get. Do yourself a favor, and get ""It Matters To Me"" instead; it's still has Faith's strong vocals, but it has songs she could sink her teeth into. This is dullsville. Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz."
4,Not a big country fan but I love this CD!,I am not a country music fan but Faith Hill's Breathe is great. She has a terrific voice which is beautifully displayed on Breathe. I recommend this CD to those who are and are not country music fans.
3,ok....,"This cd is not as good as ""Faith"". The country influence is almost gone here, making this cd a pop/rock release.The uptempos are great, for example, ""What's In It For Me"" and ""I Got My Baby"". Of course, it has pop romantic ballads like ""If I'm Not In Love"", ""That's How Love Moves"" and the duet with her husband ""Let's Make Love"", which is far away from beeing a song like 1997's ""It's Your Love"". Also, Faith has not an outstanding range, and sometimes she goes too hard, forces too much her voice, like on ""There Will Come A Day"". The title track ""Breathe"" is the big hit of the album, as also is the cheesy song 'The Way You Love Me'. But the greatest songs here are doubtless the great opening track and ""If I Should Fall Behind"". If you like Shania Twain, Martina Mc Bride, and even the Dixie Chicks, you should get these release. I wonder what Faith will do in her next release. The way she's gettin more pop each day, may be work with Britney Spears producers? Let's wait and see."
5,F A I T H,I LOVE HER NAME & HER MUSIC HAVE ALL HER CD'S THIS CD SHOWN SHE HAS GROWN AS A MUSICIAN AND MORE I LOVE HER...
5,Great CD,Awesome CD. I found my favorite songs to be Just Breathe and Let's Make Love with Faith's husband Tim.
2,"Good recordings, but not what I intended to buy","I bought this CD for the song ""The Way You Love Me"". The song is there, but it's a different track from the one I heard on the radio, which haunted my dreams for days. I'd call that ""false advertising"", but I've seen it too often, beginning with The Beatles. Oh well. It's still a good song, but now I've got to find the recording I was actually looking for.Most of the rest of the tracks on this CD don't really speak to me, though I have no problem with them as background music."
5,GREAT ALBUM,"I have been waiting in anticipation of this album for weeks and it was definitely worth the wait! It's not exactly typical Faith or typical country but I love it. Some of the songs are bluesy and have very strong vocals. My favorites are ""Breathe"", ""Let's Make Love""(the duet with Tim), ""Love Is a Sweet Thing"", and ""If My Heart Had Wings"". There is also a few fun, upbeat tunes like ""I Got My Baby"", ""What's In It For Me"",and ""Bringing Out the Elvis"". I LOVE LOVE this album. Faith is definitely going strong. If you love Faith buy it or if you just love music buy it!"
5,Great,"I didn't consider myself a country type of girl, and I don't now, but once I heard ""Breathe"" I was hooked, it has the country with a touch of pop. It is a great CD with great songs"
3,What is really typical country,"Music lover from Ohio If you love music you will love this album. I am not your typical Faith fan, I just enjoy wonderful music no matter what class it is. The song Breathe is one of the most beautiful , down deep songs from the heart that I think I have ever heard. Faith has a wonderful range to where her voice may go. If you want every song the same maybe you should try rap. This album has helped to make me a Faith Hill fan."
5,Takes my Breath away.,"I purchased Breathe the day it was released. There's not many artists that I will do that for. Usually I prefer to wait until a few songs have been released, but Faith is an exception. I was counting down the days until it was coming out. And believe me I was not dissapointed. The Album is fabulous. By most of the songs you can tell this is the happiest she's been in her life. Most of the songs are about love and are uplifting. That always makes for a great album. Some favorite songs so far. ""Love is a sweet thing"", ""Lets make Love"", ""Your bringing out the Elvis is me"", ""That's how love moves"", and ""What's in it for me"". All great songs, with great vocals. I am very happy with it. I really thought nothing could beat the ""Faith"" album, so if you liked that one then you'll love ""Breathe"". Thank you."
1,America's sweetheart turned ONE BIG ZERO.,Faith Hill has come american sweetheartto american zero.Hero to zero.What hasBreathe done to impress us.Nothing.Thereis no heart and no love in Breathe.It isjust not the faith I remember.Soemone herroots were shot down after marrying Tim.Itis just sad that she let her life slip away toBreathe.Thanks but no thanks.ONE BIGZERO.
2,country crossover again?,"Boring! While Shania is on extended vacation, here's Faith to fill her shoes for a while. Not commercially as successful but still good enuff for a 5X platinum album and two top-selling singles including a #1 song of 2000, Breathe. What lies beneath is the same marketing blitz which sees Faith being ""repackaged"" into a seductive country-pop vamp not unlike her equally boring predecessor, Shania. Yes, Faith has the vocals and the looks but her songs border on the tried-and-tested. It's a little trite by the time you run through her CD. The only possible gem may be her duet with husband Tim McGraw, Let's Make Love. Now that everyone else is not contended with the country pie, they are moving into the pop arena. If only such a move brings refreshing material rather than same old boring stuff... Move on already, Faith!"
3,Sounds Good,I Don't have this cd by faith (i have cry which is a great one) but it sounds good except for two one i can't remember and brining out the elvis not that they are bad songs (i believe that there is no such thing as bad music) i just don't like them. i like faith's pop and country sides. but anyway it sounds good
3,Faith Hill is great but I didn't really like this album,this album really only had two good songs on it the rest of the songs jsut bored me Faith hill is a great singer but this album gives her no justice
2,"Buy ""Faith"" Album Instead","I always thought Faith Hill was just another bland country singer until she released the fabulous album ""Faith."" This soulful, beautiful CD came from a different singer - a mature woman who knew the joys, sorrows, and subtleties of life. This CD is just a step backward into bland, but instead of that same old country sound, faith sounds like just another pop star. I don't care if Faith is ""country"" or not, but I do feel that she promised something wonderful with ""Faith"" and failed with this next attempt."
4,I really like this CD,"After last year's ""This Kiss,"" which was irresistable, I basically wrote Faith off as a ""cutesy"" country popster, but was I wrong. Sure, she's cute (and sexy), but it's her voice which is truly special. Every song on ""Breathe"" is sung with heartfelt emotion and warmth, and the songs are all quite good. Recommended."
2,Where did Faith go?,"Both my husband and I are big Faith Hill fans, have seen her in concert, own all her CDs, etc. Breathe was disappointing for the most part. For the exception of 2 or 3 songs, the album is morepop than country, which is what we believe Faith sings best. One Shania Twain is more than enough! Bring back the old Faith style!"
4,Very good.,"There has been always a battle between Faith and Shania Twain because they're known as the queens of pop/country music.Shania may have more fame, Grammys and Platinum awards but Faith wins in voice and she also has Grammy awards and Platinum awards.By the way, I also like Shania very much.""Breath"" is Faith's most important album. This production counts with the hit single ""Breath"" which besides it stayed several weeks at #1 in the Billboard's Hot 100. Was the most important inportant of 2000. This album was certified Platinum x7, won Grammy awards, reached #1 in the Billboard 200 and includes the #7 hit ""The way you love me"" and a duet with Faith's husband, singer Tim McGraw.My favorite songs in this album are ""Breath"", ""I got my baby"", ""The way you love me"", ""Love is a sweet thing"" and the rock one, ""What's in it for me"".This is a great album, it counts also with Faith as a producer and the lyrics are very good."
3,I have Faith that she only gets better.,"I enjoy certain songs to death, and other songs on this album should be buried deep into the earth never to resurface again. Ms. Hill is very enjoyable and talented, yet it seems that some of the songs on this album is totally made by the producers without any heart behind them. Faith still makes me dance, so if I were given the oppurtunity to buy this CD again, I would."
2,THIS ISN'T COUNTRY MUSIC.,"LIKE SHANIA TWAIN, FAITH HILL DOESN'T MAKE COUNTRY MUSIC. THIS IS PURE POP, AND NOT VERY GOOD POP AT THAT."
2,Very Disappointing Album from Faith Hill,"This is the absolute worst CD I've listened to in a long time! I bought it because I love the song ""Breathe"", and I can honestly say that ""Breathe"" and ""Let's Make Love"" with her husband Tim McGraw are the only two songs I like on the entire album! I have her album It Matters To Me, and I love that one, but this album Breathe is NOTHING even close to her earlier albums. I regret ever buying it. I don't recommend this unless you're looking for a pop album with extremely bland songs. Faith Hill is no longer country. If I had wanted a pop album, I would have purchased one. I'm very disappointed in her. Do yourself a favor; don't waste your money on Breathe. Buy her earlier albums such as It Matters To Me or Faith."
1,Boring and Silly,"I love Faith Hill; she is simply the most beautiful woman I've ever seen...period...but this collection of songs has to be the most inane and boring tripe I've heard in ages. Every tune has ""Micheal Bolton corporate generic"" written all over it; not that Faith has ever been anything other than mainstream, but at least she wasn't trying to be a Celine Dion clone. Her vocalizations on this album are overblown and grating, and the songs themselves are undistinguished. ""Bringing Out the Elvis"" is just plain dumb.Sorry, Faith, but you know I luv ya! ;)"
1,AWFUL!,I THOUGHT THAT HER LAST CD FAITH WAS BAD BUT THIS ONE IS WORSE. FAITH HAS STRAYED SO FAR FROM COUNTRY THAT IT IS A CRIME TO CALL HER A COUNTRY ARTIST ANYMORE. I'M REALLY SORRY THAT SHE HAS FOUND IT NECESSARY TO SOUND AND LOOK MORE LIKE SHANIA TWAIN. THE ONLY SONG ON THIS CD THAT COULD EVEN REMOTELY BE CALLED A COUNTRY SONG IS THE DUET WITH HER HUSBAND CALLED LET'S MAKE LOVE AND CALLING IT COUNTRY IS A REAL STRETCH. I'M SORRY I WASTED MY MONEY ON THIS ONE.
4,21 CANDLESTICKS,EXCELLENT OVERALL BOOK. EXCELLENT QUICK REVIEW WHEN NEEDED. GOOD USE OF WORDSW. GOOD PICTORIALS EXCEPT FOR THE PRINT IN RATHER FINE FOR OLDER EYES.
1,"Minimal content, maximum waste",Save your money and buy better book on Candlesticks. Poorly written vanity effort at best.
4,I too am a dog lover.,"I love this series, and the heroine's take on dogs and living with dogs is right on! Holly Winter compares everything to life in a dog's world, and it's surprising how it parallels human instances. I really am enjoying this series, and the mysteries aren't bad either. There is a little bit of ""shock value"" in each one. This particular book deals with psycho therapists and their lives with their clients. I really like Holly too. She's a straight-shooter who doesn't let anything phaze her. Great little series."
4,Great light detective reading,"Susan Conant's dog lovers' mysteries are pretty universally good reads, and this one is no exception. The side issues in the books start getting heavier as the series goes on (Women's lib here, Environmentalism, Institutionalized animal abuse in other books), but rarely get so heavy as to overshadow the book - probably because they're introduced as situations and actions rather than as preaching. Rowdy and Kimi are delightful, and if you like dogs at all, this series is well worth looking at."
5,Truly feels..Truly Understands!,The difference between this book and others is that the author has felt the anxiety herself. The emotional attachment comes through in her writing.
2,Not what I expected,"This seems more like an AA book for people with deep fears of public speaking. I was looking for techniques and tips to becoming a more effective public speaker. This book dwells too much on the ""fear"" and ""how we are not alone"". I read other people's positive reviews on this book and that is why I decided to purchase it. However, I was disappointed to find that it was light on technique. If you are terrified of public speaking and need to come to grips with your fear, then this is your book. If fear is not your main issue, in that you are looking for tips and techniques to becoming a more effective speaker, then keep looking."
5,FEAR NO MORE - This book was my ANSWER and can be YOURS,"Anxiety attacks, sweaty palms, heart-racing fear. That was me. NOW, I'm in control! I went from absolute dread at the prospect of speaking in public to actually VOLUNTEERING! Janet's book provided me with the tools and behavior modifications to overcome this self-limiting, career-crippling fear. Janet describes her personal experiences with overcoming fear, and you KNOW that she has been there. I urge anyone who has experienced fear of Public Speaking to read (and re-read) this book!"
4,Insightfull book,"Janet does a great job of outlining what you can do to improve your public speaking. One of the best ways to get over your fear is to simply do it! Toastmasters International is a great resource for this, and if you are in the San Diego area, a great local TM club is Career Builders: [...]"
5,A must read for those who suffer in silence...,I have suffered from a fear of public speaking for a very long time. I found this book on Amazon and it has changed my life. Janet does an outstanding job of getting to the core of the issue and how one can cope. I plan to attend one of her workshops in the fall because I'm just that excited to finally escape this stupid silent fear of mine. I think everyone can benefit from reading this book....even those who say that they don't have a fear of public speaking.
5,Most helpful book on the topic,"Janet Esposito's ""In the Spotlight"" is a terrific resource for people who experience deep anxiety around public speaking. I've read several books on the subject, and I found Janet's to be the most helpful of them all. Her approach to overcoming this fear is based on her personal experience, professional research, and extensive work with others who share this fear. She incorporates the best elements of other techniques used to overcome anxiety, along with practical tips and a healthy dose of encouragement. Her book explores the emotional, psychological, and physical aspects of this condition, and really helps the reader create both hope and a realistic plan for moving beyond their fear. It's really a great help.Thank you, Janet!"
5,If you have a fear of public speaking...This is the book for you!,"There are a lot of self-help books on the market that deal with the fear of public speaking. But I can say first-hand that if you are looking for help in how to overcome this fear, this is the best one you can buy.The book is more than just speaking tips or techniques---it takes you right to the heart of the issue, which I found to be surprisingly helpful. It helps you understand where the fear is coming from in the first place and how to ultimately overcome it. I read the book about a year ago, and have re-read certain chapters many times since then as both a resource and a confidence booster when I've have a big speech coming up.There's not much more I can say, other than I bought the book. It helped me. I highly reccomend it to anyone who is looking for help with this very common fear."
4,Very Helpful,"I looked at the subtitle of this book, ""overcome your fear of public speaking and performing"", and crossed my fingers and hoped that this really could be the book to help me overcome my anxiety with public speaking. I bought the book. I read the book. This book is worth reading. I didn't expect this book to be a magic pill and it is not. It is however packed with helpful tips, advice and exercises that really do help. I recommend ""In The Spotlight"" to anyone who dreads getting up in front of an audience and actually having to open their mouth and speak. This book will help."
2,Not very useful for serious MCAT review,I didn't find these flashcards useful because they only include definitions (just like a glossary from any review book). I was looking for a set of flashcards that will summarize processes using drawings/schemes. I was very disappointed when I got them.
4,Not Bad,I thought this product was good but I didn't receive it until right after I took the mcat. I did look at it and everything seemed to be in order and very helpful if you didn't want to make the cards yourself.
2,Good functionality but not Durable,"My first TSP572 unit developed a stress crack in the corner of the display; it was replaced under warranty.Longer-term, the temperature probe cable jacket started decomposing immediately, not only where a hot oven door closes upon it in use, but also where the cable joins the bent-tube probe tip.As a product design engineer, the probe-cable assembly is IMO poorly designed using unsuitable materials. Considering the replacement cost of just the probe is currently ~$8, about 1/4 the cost of a new unit, I don't believe I'd buy this product again or recommend it to others."
2,"Not bad when it works, mine broke quickly","First, the pros:- Easy to use, big numbers, accurateBut many cons:- Short wire- On/Off switch in back is small and hard to push with fingersAnd finally, mine died after 10 months, used perhaps 10 times (well, unit is fine, something is loose in the thermocouple wire so it sometimes does not read the temperature). My old Polder unit lasted 12 years."
2,meh- liked the polder better,"the thing does waht it s supposed too- a bit spendy.The batteries died, and the new ones dont fit right!!!! I use mainstream batteries, instead of the crap ones they give you- but the little ""nub"" on the top of the battery dosent reach the contact!!!! they have some plastic things in the way. I had to rig it to work with little pieces of foil to make the contact. poor design in my opinion.otherwise it does what its supposed to."
5,Great thermometer!!,"This is the 2nd one I've owned, the first one slipped from my hand and the face smashed on my sink cupboard:-(. This one now comes with an off switch which is nice although the first one I had for a year and never had to replace batteries and it didn't have the off switch. The cable is a nice, heavy duty one which I use on my charcoal smoker. It is accurate and a very good buy, I highly recommend it!!"
1,A good book to waste your time and energy.,"If you are looking for a book that just dumps in a lot of spaghetti uncoordinated meaningless text where you have to brake your head every other paragraph to find out what the authors intended to say, then this book is for you. I am going to list the points I don't like about this book:a. Paragraphs are very hard to understand.b. The code is just thrown inside without explaining it.c. Ideas are repeated all over to just build bulk.d. Almost no technical depth.e. Doesn't get to the point.By the way, I am an experienced programmer with over 8 years in the industry, so I suppose my opinion counts."
1,Not a book for those who want to learn ASP.net,"If you want to learn asp.net, this book is not the one. All it does is talk."
2,Book to read if no info is found on MSDN or online,"Man,I have not bought a book from Wrox since ASP 3.0 because the quality of book went downhill. Now they just write the books to 'sell' not to help people. I tried this book in the hopes that they may have changed, boy I was way wrong. Book all it does is talk talk talk but not show much... All this stuff is stuff I find on the MSDN and online resources. I mean, what they use to write for material!!!! The MSDN????"
1,"airplane games are not good 2D, (save the classic scrolling birds-eye view ones)","this game is just terrible. it has a point of view not different from what you would get playing sim city, and you can only go in eight directions. the camera is static (does not rotate) and has a very small field of view. I was expecting a game similar to pilotwings or something with a cockpit or 3rd person view. the controls are very clunky and awkward. this game really is not worth your time, let alone your money. I couldn't even get into the game because it was just such an eyesore! I played for about 5 minutes and all I did was fly around with all my three inches of view distance blowing up random object. whoopee."
2,F-14 TOMCAT REVIEW:,"Okay some people like it but i only like PC airplane games.The only Military games i like are one set on ""Infantry"" combat-not naval or from the air.Bye"
5,better than expected,soft. good quality. looks good. my daughter wears it every day since she's got it for holidays.
4,Good product,"I purchased this hat and scarf set for my 8 yr old son, whom absolutely loves it. I was a bit worried by some of the reviews saying that it was very scratchy but decided to give it a try anyway. He wore it the whole evening he received it and didn't once complain that it was itchy. It seems to be made well but I guess only time will tell on that. It is made out of 100% acrylic yet the label says it must be dry cleaned which is the only real complain I have about it and is why it only rates 4 stars with me. Who wants to be paying a dry cleaning bill for a hat and scarf."
1,I want the hat!!!!,I ordered this as a Christmas gift and I only received the scarf and paid for the hat and scarf!!!! I would like the hat sent to me ASAP! How can you get this wrong. It states hat and scarf on everything including receipt in package and it clearly is not. BEWARE of ordering from this seller!!!
4,just what a Harry Potter kid needs,My 7 year old son has worn this every day since Christmas. Overall its durable enough but some of the scarf tassels have come undone and fallen off. The fit of the hat is good and big enough that if he wants to it'll fit for a few years. And its soft enough for my slightly picky child.
1,Missing pages in book.,I received the book in a decent time frame over 10 days. I have started to read this book and found that pages 55-118 are missing. Sellers should really check these things before they sell books I feel cheated.
5,Excellent tool. Easy to read.,"I'm impressed with this tool...the Spanish/English are side by side and you can easily flip back and forth, whether it be for study or reading.The binding and covers are solid, very high quality--I feel this is underpriced at $...I highly recommend this resource, especially to anyone who wants to learn Spanish/English, or who evangelizes in those languages."
5,Bilingual Bible,"As a bilingual speaker, this is the Bible that I use most of the time. Sometimes reading the side-by-side passages in Spanish and English gives a clearer understanding of the meaning. It's a good choice for students of either Spanish or English as a second language."
4,Excellent tool,I just got this bible for myself and my husband so that we can help out in a Spanish church and so far it's been a great tool! Once you get the hang of seeing 2 languages on 1 page it's very easy to use.
5,NVI/NIV Biblia Bilingue Piel Burgundy,"This Bible was purchased for our 20 year old junior in college as a Christmas gift. She was sooooo excited to receive it. Most Spanish/English Bibles are only offered in New Testement versions, so a complete Bible is a real blessing. She is a Spanish major in college and loves the Lord .. so this will be something she will use her whole life serving the Lord."
5,Very happy with my purchase,I have to learn spanish because my husband and I are going to Guatemala to become missionaries. I have been using Scripture from this Bible to help me learn. It is perfect!
4,NIV/Biblia Bilingue,This Bible in both Spanish and English has been extremely helpful for my Spanish speaking Bible study each week!
5,Great Bible!,"I was looking for an English/Spanish Bible that would not be so big and heavy and easy to understand.This bible is exactly what I was looking for. It's not heavy, I like the hardcover and it helps me in my spanish cell group as well as the English cell group. This is a great bible to have when you belong to a Bilingual church."
5,NVI/NIV Bible,"The bible is very nice, easy to understand. Great version. The only downside is the size of the letters. Either a bit bigger or bold text would've been nice."
3,great format but awful copy editing,"It's exactly what I wanted: a Bible with Spanish on one side, English on the other. However, I was horrified at the number of copy-editing errors in the introduction. I actually stopped counting them. Very sloppy. So far, I haven't seen the same problem in the text itself, but if there is a Spanish error I may very well not recognize it."
3,Not as seen in the picture,"I was disappointed when I received this Bible, because it did not look like the picture on Amazon. I had just bought a blue and black Bible (like the one pictured on Amazon) for a college student at a local store, and her friend liked it so much she wanted one. When the store said they had run out, I ordered two from Amazon: one for her and one for me. The two Bibles arrived very quickly, but inside the blue and black boxes were plain black Bibles--rather old-fashioned looking. They were nicely packaged, but it is disappointing when you assume you have purchased one item and then receive something quite different. That said, the inside is attractive and laid out nicely. It would make a great gift for a bilingual student/friend/Christian worker."
3,Same item available for less under other name,"The Bible itself is of course five stars; the problem is that this sounds like a different item, but is identical to Santa Biblia/Holy Bible, NVI/NIV, Nueva Version Internacional/New International Version (Spanish and English Edition) [Hardcover], which costs about $5 less. I ordered some of each, thinking there were additional study materials in the more expensive version--but there is no difference, so go with the other item and get the Word in two languages for less!"
3,Just okay,"Text is small, difficult with poor eyesight. Item presented wkth cover, not present. Will continue to look for a better item."
3,Okay,"I got this for my Spanish class, but it was so heavy! I have to walk everywhere, so I need as many light books as possible. I bet there are other lighter versions of the Spanish Bible, and I wish I got one of those."
5,Pawsing to take a nap,"Cute little bed with built in pillow...when Paddy the Shih Tzu isn't napping on it, his sister, Bandit the cat, is found taking her midday snooze. Very nice addition to all their creature comforts!"
2,Is it over yet?!,"From the first impressions that I derived from the trailer I was anxious to see what I thought would be a very moving story of reality and poverty right here in America. Sadly, this was a poorly written attempt to convey such reality to others. It simply was.., all over the place with absolutely no continuity of story. Aside from a good cast, I could hardly wait for this one to be over!"
3,Okay,This movie turned out not to be as good as advertised. I received in a timely fashion and it was in great shape though.
5,Best book on FileMaker Pro I have seen to date.,"Over the years I have purchased ten or more books on FileMaker Pro. Most of these books rehash the same information that can be found in the user's manual. This book provides a more advanced look at FileMaker Pro topics and is written from the point of view of a developer. Some of the topics not found in the manual include techniques for dealing with common errors made by users (such as striking the return key at the end of data entry in a field which can adversely affect field concatenation), error trapping, field masking, and user interface tips.If you are looking for something more than is found in the manual, I recommend this book."
5,Great guide for overall development,"I have a pretty nice library of FileMaker books and this is my favorite. The thoughtful review of how to consider a design on paper before developing, along with hints about how to interact with clients and use diagrams gave a structure to my communications with clients that is professional and powerful. In addition to this there are amazing hints and chapters of information that I (joyfully) continue to refer to in my development practice, though I've had the book for years now. More than any other, it put me in control, and I am grateful."
4,An excellent collection of words to practice,My voice coach suggested this book and it seems it is pretty rare book. The book is excellent for practicing the sounds of each word. The words are categorized by sound and syllables. This is a great source when you want to improve diction of specific words or family of words starting with particular syllable. Absolutely must for voice coaching and accent reduction practice.
5,A taste of Navy SEALs?,"This is the most amazing exercise book I've EVER read. It's literally a crime they don't publish it anymore. Fitzgerald's exercise regimen is guaranteed to give you unbelievably ""cut"" muscles in a short time. His regimen will also force you to dig deep inside yourself for stamina, willpower, and endurance. Sound familiar? It should: Fitzgerald is ex-UDT.For lower body conditioning, nothing I've seen compares to Fitzgerald's book. However, readers should add the upper-body and cross-training exercises found in the recent publications by Caracci, Helvenston, DeLisle, Smith, and other Navy SEALs."
5,The Original! (And Best?),"The workout programme described in this book is deceptively difficult! Having read many of the recent titles which detail Navy SEAL workout regimens, I have found this one to be the most practical and time efficient. Some of the exercises would be considered obsolete by many, but once you get down to the nitty gritty this is a hardcore training programme (As one would expect from a former Navy frogman!). The instructions are very clear and presented with wry humour. The weekly and daily schedules are particularly effective as you can monitor your progress daily which is very motivating. It is also interesting to note that this book was first published in 1985! If you can find a copy, Buy it!"
4,Tougher than it looks,"On paper, this program doesnt look all that challenging. When you start doing the workouts though, if you arent used to a calisthenics program/body weight exercises and maybe are only used to weights, it will challenge you. One of the things I appreciate about this program is the importance placed on stretching - many of the fad exercises programs dont really touch on this, but for long term conditioning it is essential. Also each exercises is explained and good pictures of the movements are provided.In order to make it my own, i have added some exercises and adjusted to keep my body guessing and keep things fresh. I've never really been good at staying strict w/ these kinds of programs."
2,Nice at first but then....,"I love broiled haddock and salmon, so I used this product alot. The first several uses, it was great...then the paint or coating or whatever it is, started to peel and come off exposing the bare metal underneath, now I'm hesitant to use it anymore because of health dangers. I am currently looking for something to replace it because I miss my broiled fish"
5,Everything & The Kitchen Sink!!!!!!!!,"A testimony for all-time! The American way of life captured through the lives of three astonishing individuals. The book has everything, THE ORIGINAL REALITY BOOK! Pope John Paul II enemies exposed! LeBron James exposed! The Raise of the Titanic Exposed~!"
1,If you follow this map you will get lost!,"This ""book"" is great for the bathroom, that is if your running low on toilet paper. The three authors clearly have very diverse lives and very little in common. Somehow, they managed to throw this book together in the hopes that someone would actually believe the stories they tell. I have seen better leteracy skills on the stalls of airport latrines."
5,good bulbs for 18 V rechargeables in the combo kits,Other bulbs I tried weren't rated to hold up to that power and the 18 Volt battery blew them out - this does the trick!
2,Not big on durability,"I've had trouble finding these bulbs. I finally found them on Amazon, the price was reasonable and the shipping was timely. However, in both bulbs the filaments broke while I was adjusting the angle of the flashlight. Unfortunately none of the local hardware stores stock this size bulb so I'm going to have to order them again. If you buy these just be careful you don't jar them at all while the flashlight is on."
2,poor,"The filament broke while adjusting the tilt angle of the flashlight, at least you have a spare behind the lens. These bulbs are difficult to find, however I tried the DeWalt DW9083 18-Volt Flashlight Replacement Bulb, 2 Pack from Amazon and they worked perfectly!"
2,Less Than What I Expected,"I beleive I know more about Chris Farley than Ms. Anderson does. Seems as though she only watched the Saturday Night Live sketches because she had too.This book reads like a high school essay. All the author does is rehash what we all saw on ""The E!True Hollywood Story"". Describing the sketches Chris had performed verbatim, with bad grammar no less, who couldn't do that? Seems as though the author cut and pasted SNL sketches, Entertainment Tonight interveiws and magazine articles together to write this pamphlet.If you are a true fan of Mr.Farley's, I'd advice you to wait until a deeply researched book is published."
3,"Great subject, well meaning, but way too short.","As a fan of Chris Farley's work on SNL and in movies, I was looking forward to some insight into this troubled man's life. Sadly, this book contains precious little insight into Chris and his sad demise.If you too have laughed out loud at the antics and performances made famous by Chris, and were saddened by his early passing, then you may find this book an interesting, albeit very brief, look at his career and life. However, the in depth analysis is lacking and the book is far too short for the price."
5,"Garry Shandling, get out your notebook","I was lucky enough to stumble upon ""The Newsroom"" on PBS, and after having only caught 3 episodes, they stopped showing it. Right away, I searched far and wide over the internet for this boxed set, and it's one of my most prized possessions. A half hour of this show is funnier than most of today's two hour movies. It's perfect in every aspect: writing, acting, directing, and laughs. It remains one of my favorite TV shows or movies, and if you like classics like this is spinal tap, larry sanders show, or network, this you have to check out."
4,interesting read,"I found this book very useful to approach Foucault's writing. A stepping stone, or a easier and mundane interpretation of Foucault's philosophy."
3,PICTURES AND WRITTEN INFO,WHY ARE THE PICTURES SO SMALL AND WHY CANT I ZOOM IN. SOME REVIEWS SAY THAT THIS PRODUCT HAS ONE DISC AND OTHERS SAY ITS 4 DISCS. WHICH IS IT? I LIKE TO BUY TELENOVELAS THAT ARE AS COMPLETE AS POSSIBLE. I INTEND ON BUYING THIS ONE BUT NOT IF ITS 1 DISC. WOULD SOME ONE PLEASE POST BETTER PICTURES SO THAT I CAN MAKE OUT THE WORDS ON IT.
1,terrrible!,"This nozzle on the JET setting DOES NOT produce a jet stream....very disappointed...will buy locally one of the ""big box"" store from now on!"
4,good buy,"This is a very nice nozzle. It has nine different spray options, e.g., shower, flood, mist, and angled. I like the way you can lock it so you don't have to keep pressing the trigger. I would recommend this to a friend."
3,For very beginners only,"It is a beautiful book and a big book. However it is definitely for someone who has never scrapbooked and is just starting. I didn't get very inspired by the layouts that are a bit old school and I was already familiar with the techniques. If you're looking for a challenge, that's not the book for you, but if you are looking to get started with this fabulous hobby, definitely a complete book."
3,Good general overview and source of ideas.,"I have come to the conclusion that I'm not a ""scrapbooker."" I am a ""photograph album maker"" who borrows ideas from scrapbookers. My objective is not to make beautiful and artistic pages that contain photographs as one of the elements. My objective is to display photographs in an attractive way, using backgrounds, decorative papers and other elements as supporting materials.My album pages will never be as artistic as those displayed in this and other scrapbooking books. Mine have too many photographs on each page to allow for much decoration. But I borrow, a color scheme, an arrangement, a way of cropping, a captioning idea (I really can't call it ""journaling"") and it becomes a hybrid sort of scrapbooking.This book, due to the uncluttered simplicity of the designs and layouts, provides me with more and better ideas on how to use my page to make my photo albums more than a chronological and geometric arrangement of photographs."
5,"Scrapbooking made easy, book",So many samples and creative projects included in this book. Many detailed instructions on scrapbooking/card making techniques. A great addition to my creative library.WOuld recommend.
5,ALL Inclusive,"Great information for a beginner scrapbooker. I am finally able to do 60 years of pictures for family.Book shows it all, from simple to very elaborate with examples clear and helpful."
5,A classic recording.,"To read the words on the page is one thing. To hear them read by the author is a grand experience. I heard Mr. Harper read and speak on the NPR program ""Fresh Air"" some time ago, and I have been looking for an audio recording of his poems since. This is an excellent selection of works from various books. Some I hadn't even read before. And of course it includes some well known pieces like ""Nightmare Begins Responsibility"" and ""Here Where Coltrane Is."" Now I'm off to buy some of the book titles with poems I've just now discovered."
2,Not that great..,"I wouldnt suggest buying this magnet to save a few bucks. Its pretty narrow and not as strong as the Marineland brand. It does work, but its not nearly as good."
1,Not very good,This did not work as I had expected. The magnet strength was not very strong. It constantly disconnected when I was trying to clean the tank. This must be known because they give you a piece to thread to pull the fallen piece up.
3,Take it serious?,"How am I supposed to take this map serious, if it obviously has got a photograph of the Bahamas on its cover, and not, as it claims, the Panama Canal? I'm sorry, that's a bad start. The map has already its age, it was a very good one in its 1st edition, but unfortunately it's getting worse with every socalled ""new"" edition. No updates, actually. It seems ITMB is just changing the cover... However, still the best map on Panama on the market."
4,Nice functional headset,"I like this headset. I wear it without the wire ear hook as it fits nicely in my ear canal. The audio quality is good. It is easy to set up and easy to use. One of the best bits is the clip which comes with a ""silver"" chain so you can hang it round your neck which makes it hard to lose. I wear it continuously but have replaced the chain with silver rope so it does not tarnish, People often think it is my phone itself and comment on its small size."
2,Headset,"Excellent size, appearance and ergonomics, but sound quality on both ends and lack of noise cancellation makes this a returned product and disappointment for me."
4,(...) pretty good,"It served me well on two camping trips so far.All units stack inside of each other for easy storage.The spot welds for the handles could be better, only two spot welds so I am wondering how long these will last, maybe I can silver solder them for added durability.Handles fold on the outside so they are very compact.I would not waste my money on titanium sets."
4,Pretty Godd - Built to a price,"Hello All, I motorcycle camp and I have found the best source of items is backpacking equipment. This set is built out of thin SS material with a flash plating of copper on the bottom. Because I Motorcycle camp it could have weighed more and thus would have been more substantial. The 2 plastic cups are about useless as they are 8 oz and I'm more of a 16oz kind of a guy. I don't use the smaller pan because I can then load the bigger pan with various cooking condiments and supplies. While weight isn't an issue for me packing size is. I thought this set represents a good value for the price. I'm pleased with my purchase."
2,Unhappy,I am very upset with my purchase i am missing 4 pieces of it the large cook pot and cover as well as the 2 cups.
2,Just average...,"They say ""You get what you pay for""...But it was better than the first camping gear we bought."
1,Piece of Junk II,"Ditto to Jim's review on this. The Classic Sport Arcade Hoop is a piece of junk. It is missing parts, the wood veneer on the exterior is cracking and peeling off, and there are cracks in the wooden frame. To top it off, it weighs almost 100 pounds - not what you want hanging off your drywall."
4,best father's day present!,"We love the arcade hoop. It is fun for everyone to play with -- the kids and the adults! It wasn't too bad to put together, the hardest part was attaching it to the brackets that you put on the wall. It is heavy and has to be attached 5 feet off the ground, so it is awkward."
2,Interesting but not the most interesting one,"It is the opportunity to find out Nolde's watercolors even if unfortunately theye are not all listed. You have 54 watercolours on 1,300, but it is still a good start to know a little bit more about this German artist.Now I have read a few books about him, I am not sure it would be the number one on my list, but it would be mentioned."
4,Very good,"I liked, though did not love, this book. I think that perhaps there are too many reproductions, some of which are inferior to the others. I hope that when I die and become a famous artist (well, one can hope, can't they?) someone will edit my work with more care.Still Nolde is always interesting and this book is worth it for fans of his work."
1,Soo slippery!,Can't be used for yoga..at all! Terrible waste of money. It's like they did no testing of the product before they sold it.
3,Not for the beginner,"I wanted to learn how to Tat and took the title ""Easy Tatting"" at it's word. While the patterns are easy to read, the techniques are not as easy as the title suggests. Next time I will invest in a more simplified tutorial book than something that uses ""easy"" in the title."
5,Very Nice!,I have make one of the projects and the instructions are very easy to follow and I can't wait to try more!
4,Very good,"I am a beginner, and this book really helped me to progress to shuttle-and-second thread tatting. Other books are kind of stuffy and hard to understand. The only complaint I might have is that the author doesn't introduce slightly more complicated tatting charts using 2 shuttles, but this book is definitly enough to get you started!"
4,Great review book,"I don't know if this is a good book for beginner's, but I learned to tat from my grandmother a millinium ago, and this is a great refresher to allow me to pick it up."
2,dissapoinment! I thought it would lay out menus.,"I ordered this book hoping it would be a weekly version of the once a month cooking books, intead it just had advice on freezing and preserving and a bunch of recipes, I still have to do all the planning, just as I would with any other cookbook.Isabel in RI"
1,Cook Once? When?,The title of this book implies that the author will help you do a big cookfest on the weekend and then store it for the week. This is just another cookbook. Wish I hadn't wasted my time.
3,Avoid Stress and pre-cook your meals!,"Good recipes after review, but no pictures! I don't personally like cookbooks with no pictures so I had not tried any of them yet in my kitchen..."
5,Give Us All Them Hits From A to Z!,"Achieving so many hits that not even all were released on the CD (take ""This Is How We Do It"" for instance) Mis-Teeq is a truly accomplished, not to mention truly talented group!Their last single was 2005's ""Shoo Shoo Baby,"" their goodbye because they have gone their separate paths, but are sure to remain close.The girls have true talent, being sassy and wonderful singers/songwriters/producers/dancers. They have also helped with the arrangement of their albums.Mis-Teeq's videos are also stunning, hypnotizing, pieces of art. The girls are extremely talented, as well as their singles. From super danceable and memorable hits (""Scandalous,"" & ""Why,"") to the party anthems (""Roll On,"" & ""One Night Stand""), Mis-Teeq is always satisfying!Mis-Teeq is extremely talented (singers/songwriters/producers/ dancers/etc.) and have some of the greatest songs and hits. They will always live on, and won't be disappearing anywhere although they are no longer together.Mis-Teeq for live!"
4,"A nice, basic reference book","I got this book many years ago, and read it cover to cover. But I must say that only recently have I begun to realize what an excellent book this is.This book covers the basics of a variety of subjects from all different religious paths. Reincarnation, stigmata, Eastern mysticism, fortune-telling...that's only a tiny sample of the information Francis X. King touches on. This book is simple, easy-to-read, and has an excellent index. Very few books on the market today cover as many subjects as this one so concisely.This book's only weakness is its tendency to get a little TOO simple at times. However, it is a great reference when you need some quick information on a subject."
3,A Bit Too Advanced,"I feel it's important to begin teaching our kids at an early age about ""stranger danger"". This book was recommended for children as young as four, and so I bought it yesterday to begin teaching my four year old son about strangers. We tried to read it last night, and the language and even message were way over his head. I'm sure this would be a good book for slightly older kids, but I wouldn't recommend it for anyone under six."
4,CHILD AWARENESS OF STRANGERS,HELPS KIDS TO BE ON AWARES OF A SITUATION THAT IS DANGEROUS WITH PEOPLE AND HOW TO REACT FOR SAFETY.
5,It has clutch and break pedals!,"But they don't work of course. After seeing such detail and great craftsmanship, I expected at least the rear break to work! It would be nice if it did.The only thing that is not OK with this bike is its exhaust pipes are not as thick as real. Other than that, it is a real good figure."
4,"Not as good as Quah, but worth having","If you like Hot Tuna or Jorma, this isn't even in the top 10. But Jorma is so good, it's still worth having. The last track is pretty funny."
3,One of his weirder ones....,"OK, can somebody please explain what the hell ""Da-Ga Da-Ga"" is all about? What sort of psychedelics was our Jorma on when this was conceived? And recorded? And released?"
5,Do you know how lucky you are?,"These films are some of the few in all of anime that can truthfully be called ""legendary"". Serious fans of anime have been waiting for years for these DVDs. The fact that they are finally available, and that Disney has done such a first class job with them, is nothing short of wonderful. I suggest buying all three them today, you will be very happy you did.All three movies are made to be enjoyed by people of all ages. All three feature world-beating animation, wonderful scores and terrific scripts. Other than that, these are three very different and distinct movies. I consider each movie to be a masterpiece in its own way (Castle in the Sky being my personal favorite). If you haven't seen any of them yet, I envy you. You're in for a unique treat. Do yourself a favor and see as many Miyazaki films as you can get your hands on. This is the best place to start."
4,Remarkable!,"This book tells of the author's experiences and adventures when she went to the Middle East to explore her faith and spirituality. Her descriptions of the landscape, climate, culture and people make it easy to imagine you're with her on the journey. I particularly liked the addition of historical information that was relevant to the situation being described.The author's interactions and relationships with the people dispel the sterotypes created by the media coverage of the region.By the time I finished the book, the Holy Land had become a real place, with real people, living real lives in a remarkable setting but often under difficult circumstances.A facinating read!"
4,Gets you thinking,"I like provocative books, and this one offers a nice pallet. I'll spend my Y2K at home, under the covers, thank you very much! If you enjoy fiction on this subject, a book I recommend highly is Glen Kleier's suspense thriller, THE LAST DAY. It's a very original, VERY unusual look at the turn of the millennium. Probably one of the most thought provoking books I've ever read. Simply a great story for anyone looking to commemorate this event of a lifetime with something special."
5,If you buy only one Y2K book----buy this one!,"Sit down in a comfortable chair, have on the end table an empty cup, a thermos of coffee, - and in your hands - this book. You'll finish the 235 pages before the coffee runs out. You'll gulp the last bit the coffee pondering the statistical and highly researched facts that you've just read, returning the empty thermos to your kitchen, all the while soberly planning the survival techniques you will put into place before the end of 1999. It's been called ""The book that could save your life"" - and it could!"
3,Too much information,"I think the book was well written although I must say I think there are going to be a lot of people feeling like fools when the year changes and we all go on with our lives.Year 2000 is a media plot. I mindless money maker. Use common sense, be prepared but most importantly.. don't panic. In the big scheme of things we're all in this together so whats the big deal?"
5,Ladies-This one you've GOT to see!,"Guys don't get it. Male film critics didn't either. But female moviegoers did! This is a good, old-fashioned romance-adventure that everyone can see, from your grandmother to your children. It's about time, Hollywood! Every actor is splendid from the lead (James Cavaziel) who portrays Edmond Dantes (ladies, this actor is drop-dead gorgeous), to his true love, Mercedes (Dagmar Dominczynk), to the villain (Guy Pearce) and humorous turns by ""Priest"" (Richard Harris, his usual brilliant self), and the devoted friend, Luigi (JB Blanc) and the devoted servant (Luis Guzman). Swash buckling, revenge, even lessons learned and devotion to God. What a package! Buy it today. Will make a great stocking stuffer for your best friend, sister, cousin."
1,A butchery of the book,"I had just finished reading the book and decided I'd like see how it was adapted to the big screen. This version was the worst adaptation I've seen of a book made into a movie. As I watched the film I wondered if the makers of the movie even bothered to read the book. My girlfriend kept asking me during the film if ""that happened in the book?"" At the end of the movie I told her that basically everything in the movie was not how it occurred in the book. She enjoyed the movie until the end when it was like a ""cheesy 80's montage"".The book is wonderful. When I finished reading it, I felt like I had lost a good friend-I wished I could just keep reading it and reading it. I've never read such an excellent novel."
5,"Excellent -- a ""must see""!","A timeless masterpiece! A great story with terrific actors, brilliant dialogue in a beautiful location. Both Dantes (Jim Caviezel) as well as his evil friend, Mondego (Guy Pearce) were outstanding. Also the close relationship between Dantes and the Priest (Richard Harris) so touching. And who could forget Jacopo (Luis Guzman)?! Everyone I have shown this film to (young to old) love it. You will not be disappointed!"
4,count of monte cristo,I recieved this movie will before it was due to come to me. Am very happy with your service. thanks for the great service.
5,(;D)....(:D),"This movie is really good. It is a little long, but it is totally worth it. It's exciting, emotional, dramatic, and captivating. Everyone should see this one!"
3,Dumas must be spinning in his grave...,"Overall it was a good movie, but it's sacrilegious to call it the Count of Monte Cristo. I don't understand how people can claim it to be a good portrayal of the book. It was savagely hacked! The Count of Monte Cristo is a brilliant epic, and the character is one of the most fascinating ever created. These Hollywood clots turned him in to nothing more than an executioner. Do yourself a favor; buy the book (even the abridged if you don't want to tackle the 1400+ page edition). You will be far better entertained and better for it."
4,A Classic Returns to the Big Screen,"Dumas' classic tale returns in another retelling of this enjoyable adventure. Guy Pierce and James Caveizel did well with their portrayal of the friends torn apart by jealousy. Overall, I would say that this was a most entertaining film and definately worth a look."
4,Started slow....then took off!!,"I have to admit that I was really hoping that this movie would be great based on the trailers.After the first 10 minutes, I was very much on the fence. Some of the scenes they used to set up the plot were unconvincing. But then, both the script and the action sequences really took off, and I couldn't take my eyes off the screen!It was a very clever script, and while I found it interesting that the ""French"" characters all had British accents (standard Hollywood, I guess), you don't have time to focus on those sorts of details.I did not give it 5 stars because I was disappointed in the way the plot was set up. I just didn't buy the fact that one friend would betray another over a petty little incident (you have to see the movie to know what it was!). Outside of that, a great flick!"
5,Excellent,Saw this movie retelling the old story on TV loved it so much I bought the movie. The one with Richard chamberlain was a little slow but this one had a lot of flow.
3,An Enjoyable 2 Hours,"I didn't expect to like this movie. I expected major fencing and swash-buckling, but I found a good mix of action, drama, humor, and pathos. (I had to close my eyes only once.) Richard Harris is wonderful. The other cast members are good at their roles too. I recommend this to people who like fencing and swash-buckling and those who don't. It's enjoyable on many levels."
3,Monte Cristo in 2 Hour Film?,"The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas is an over-1200-page voluminous novel. How could this super-long drama be fit into two hours? This film did that misson-impossible task. Compared with French TV-series starring Gerald Depardieu as the Count of Monte Cristo, first half of the story is well depicted, while the latter part is too brief. There is no Valentine nearly poisoned by her step mother, no Haydee, former Turk princess. And the story depends too much on duels so it is more visually described than the original story's deliberate revenge plan. But the relief is that Albert's role is spared and is given a huge part in this drama.Verdict: Monte Cristo for Young AdultsRating: 70 out of 100. For shorter adaptation it is good.Recommended for: Historical action movie fans and Three Musketeers appreciators."
1,Generic Hollywood Rubish,This movie is the events of Dumas' classic stamped onto a canned Hollywood adventure/love story. The formula is the same used in 80's montage movies: 1) Weak but good-hearted kid suffers as he hands of evil men. 2) Kid has a montage. 3) Kid gets revenge.
3,***Flawed DVD!***,I enjoyed the movie and I purchased it to add to my dvd collection. Unfortunately the particular disc I received from Amazon was flawed and unwatchable. Hope you have better luck.
3,"Ehhhh, It's Ok.","Well, there's one thing that's hard to go wrong with and that's a classic story. It's hard to fault the plot, when it's based on a renowned classic like Dumas' The Count Of Monte Cristo, even if it is a simple revenge tale. Unfortunately, none of the acting rises above the page.None of the leading men are quite manly. James Caviezel who plays Edmond Dantes and Guy Pearce, who plays Fernand Mondego both come across a little weak as swashbucklers. Caviezel tends to be a blank slate anyway, but I really liked Pearce in Memento, so I was a little disappointed to see his be such a weak character. You do dislike Fernand Mondego and want to see him meet his demise, but Pearce could have taken it much further and given Caviezel more distance to grow as a character. Richard Harris may have walked through this role, but he delivers the best performance of all the actors.Overall, it's a good Saturday movie if you want to watch some guys sword fight a little bit and not have to think to much."
2,eww,this movie was a bit away from the book which should be read!although if you were to never read the book the movie is okay.
2,Somewhat boring,"I've never read the book so I cant compare, but I do remember that the film itself was quite boring at times and just too long, or at least it felt long. Normally I love movies like this, but this just didn't do it for me. The acting was OK, nothing special stuck out out for me. The set pieces and costumes were very well done however, which I think is essential in a movie such as this. Other than that, I would skip it."
2,disappointing.,"I found it to be an insult to the novel, discrediting the artistic merit of the original. The flaky acting, the ludicrously flamboyant setting, rocky flow of the movie, and the unbelievable characters - I couldn't contain myself from making sarcastic commentaries at certain dialogues. It wasn't necessarily painful to watch, but I certainly had better ways to spend my money and time. There's so many ways to entertain yourself; steer yourself away from this one."
3,Fine movie but a bit too slow.,"It's a decent adaptation of Dumas book. There is a good storytelling, fine playing, nice scenery, interesting plot, and colorful costumes and make-up. The movie has some ups (Monte Cristo revenge with climax scenes by the end of the movie) and downs (Monte Cristo prison time). For my taste I prefered old French movie with Belmondo. It was faster and more swashbuckling. This adaptation attempts to concentrate on characters rather than adventure. It's still worth to watch it."
2,Not what I was expecting.,"Was it entertaining? Yes. Was it anything like the book? Absolutely not. I was very disappointed in this movie because the story line strayed so far away from Dumas' original plot that I don't think it should even carry the title of The Count of Monte Cristo. The book is my all time favorite read, and I would love to see a newer adaption of this novel that encompasses all the inner workings of this novel. I understand it is next to impossible to incorporate all the detailed plot lines involved in this story, but if you're going to include them, at least stick to the true story. Or close to it, anyway."
3,Well at least they can act.,"I'm going to keep this short and sweet. You probably already know about the plot so I won't talk about that, but I must say a few things. The actors did very well in the movie and the plot goes along very nicely. But within the first half hour I spotted the boom mic 4 times! Once you can see the whole arm, wires and everything and there is another shot were you can see 2 of them going in and out of the top of the screen it was like I was playing Wak-A-Mole! Other then the completely sorry editing it was a good movie. I can only hope upon its arrive on DVD it will be remasterd."
3,From the mouth of babes...,"My 13 year old daughter commented after having viewed this movie, ""I am glad that I saw the movie before I read the book ..."", and for once, I would have to wholeheartedly agree with her, as there is little similarity between the movie and Dumas' work.On a more positive note, please be advised that my youngest daughter and my husband, who were initially intrigued by the theatrical trailers, thought the movie ""was more than okay""."
4,Good Time !!!!!!,"Count of M. was a good time for me and my guest. The photography and settings both inside and out are exactly what I believe a picture of this genre should be. the story line was romantic and kept your interest. I do feel that the prison scenes were longer than necessary the point had been made and so the plot should have moved a little faster. The actors, though not name performers, were excellent and did have screen charisma. I expecially enjoyed the splendor of the Count's introduction to the people in Paris this alone was worth seeing the film for. All in all it was a lot of fun."
5,Better than the book,"I love to read and am normally disappointed in the movies which are based on those books. This is the exception. Great, believable characters. Excellent character development. And some sword play and action to keep the men in your life interested."
3,Great...until the ending,"I read the 'Monte Cristo' book a few months before the movie came out and I adored it, so I was really pumped up to see it on screen. First off, the actors were perfectly casted and the director did a great job adapting the book to film. BUT,I have to take points off for the ending. Whenever a book is made into a movie, the plot is tweaked and molded to be more entertaining visually. My issue was not just that the ending was changed, it was the COMPLETE OPPOSITE of what happened in the book! It was totally ridiculous! It was exactly what you would expect to happen, even though it was totally unrealistic. That's why I gave it only three stars. If you're speaking in terms of overall cinematic experience, it's a wonderful film. I suggest that you read the book first, see the movie, and judge for yourself. Or if you've already seen the film, go read the book anyway and see what you missed."
5,Amazing!,"This movie was truly amazing! Jim Caviezel was excellent as the count, and you loved to hate Guy Pearce as his friend-gone-enemy.The cenimatography was beautiful, and while it was long, you love every minute of it. There are some well done action sequences (with quickened framework that adds to the tension) and the adaptation from the novel (while forced to leave a lot out, obviously...the book is insanely long!)is far better than most works of this sort. It maintains a more comic-book approach to violence and gore (the same as Mask Of Zorro, in that they leave a lot of blood and guts out, so if you're looking for shredded bodies go elsewhere) and it's well worth your while!"
4,Excellent movie,"This movie provides one of the best film interpretations of Dumas' book I've seen. Although much of the plot is cut out, realistically this movie is a great adaptation of an amazing book. If you choose to see this movie, be sure to read the unabridged version of the book as well. Even if you're not in it for the literature, this movie is an exciting watch regardless."
3,Good but not great,Because I read the Count of Monte Cristo in it's entirety three times in high school I was disappointed with the liberties the director has taken in this cinematic version of the film. It starts out fine but about 1/5th of the way into the movie it begins to depart dramatically from the book. I guess if you have never read the book the movie might be ok but I was so hoping to see the whole story of the Count of Monte Cristo told in all it's glory in the DVD. The story line is based loosely on the story as written by Alexandre Dumas but it departs in very significant ways from the book so much so that by the end it doesn't resemble the book at all.
2,Good cast and scenery don't make up for a story so far removed from Mr Dumas' incredible book,The cast was good as was the the movie in general were it not for the fact that the story was so different from the actual book. It was a real dissappointment to say the least.
1,This is what happens when you cram a classic into a matinee,"After finishing Dumas' classic novel, I immediatly watched this movie. About an hour later, and a hillarious balloon scene, I sadly ejected the DVD, which I now use for a coaster. If you've never read the book, you've got nothing to lose. But if you've ever read the book, you get that sense of annoyance very quickly, and outrage towards the end. Do yourself a favor and read the book first! It is excellent!"
2,Disappointing,The positive reviews must be from people who have not read the book. The Count of Monte Cristo is one of my favorite books. The movie barely resembles the story in the book and fails to capture the spirit of the characters in the book.I can see how the movie would be entertaining if you haven't read the book. But I strongly recommend you read the book instead.The Count of Monte Cristo (Penguin Classics)
1,The Count of Monte Cristo,Please respond...I NEVER WAS ABLE TO VIEW THIS MOVIE AND WHEN I CAME BACK TO THE COMPUTER TO WATCH IT WAS GONE AND I GUESS I HAD TO RE-RENT IT TO SEE IT. I was very disappointed as I do like Jim Caveziel and was looking forward to seeing this. The date was not up yet either I believe. Can I still watch it?Thank you.
2,Changed the whole tone of the thing by changing the end,"I agree that it may be necessary to change parts of a story to make the 2 hour limit common to most movies. I think that the ending (without giving it away, if you care) goes counter to the vengence theme Mr. Dumas was weaving. So as to who the Count winds up with may be an issue of what is acceptable to the movie industry racially, and it may just be a simpleminded simplification. If you've never read the book, read it. It is melodramatic. The ending in it makes more sense than the end of this movie.As an aside, I think that Mel Gibson must have seen this movie and settled on Mr. Caviezel as the lead after seeing his portrayal of the imprisoned Edmond Dantes. He is whipped 3 times in the movie and is made up to look astonishingly like the Jesus he portrayed in Gibson's movie. Looks like he is being type cast."
3,Good movie but not based on the actual book,"The production value, cast, acting, storyline, etc. of this were good and entertaining. The problem is the movie is more UNLIKE the book than it is like the book.If you want to watch a movie of the book itself, you will want to look atThe Count of Monte Cristo"
4,Good transaction,Arrived withing the time period listed. DVD had popped loose from post inside case (probably occurred during shipping)and disc was slightly scratched. Played fine and have no complaints.
2,Count of Monte Cristo,The movie arrived on time. It had one major flaw in the middle of the film that was disappointing to me. I was not able to remove it by cleaning the disc.
2,"Well-acted, but terrible adaptation","From the previews, this movie looked really exciting. But for those who have actually read the book, watching this movie might be a little disturbing (to understate it). Hollywood has had its way yet again in this movie squashing events together and changing the plot so it is ""convenient."" Otherwise, there were some jokes that made it entertaining. Has anyone noticed the leather-bound books in the prison cells that appeared out of nowhere?"
4,"Great ""sleeper"" movie","This is a great movie. That many people don't know about. Jim Caviezel and Guy Pearce do great acting. I think after Guy Pearce's performance, I won't like him if I ever meet him in real life. He makes his character so dis likable. Which is the point!"
4,Count of Monte Cristo,"I thought it was a great movie. Really touching. Terriable how some ""friends"" treat others. I am glad it was a happy ending."
5,Another Great Performance,"This should be labeled as one of the greatest movies of all times. James Caviezel is exceptional here. He should have been nominated for a Oscar. If you have not read the book you should definately read it to fill in the blanks and better understand the changes made in the movie. Alexander Dumas one of the greatest French authors of his time is best known for The Three Muketeers, but his popularity for The Count of Monte Cristo is growing. A little known fact regarding Dumas is that he was of African decent."
3,Mistitled perhaps?,"Okay, if you are a person who loved the original novel - you will not enjoy this movie as an adaptation. But, if you haven't read Dumas' classic, you'll probably think this movie is very good. And it is a good movie - well acted, good pacing, excellent sets (love the period pieces). It's sword fights and buried treasure and revenge most sweet. As a whole, a very enjoyable film. Too bad they didn't just forget trying to sell it as ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" and name it something else."
5,The Best Movie I Have Seen In Theaters,"I normally don't go to movies, but I loved the book so I had to go see ""The Count of Monte Cristo."" Although it didn't follow the book to closely, the acting was great and the costumes were so beautiful! This is a movie that guys and girls are going to like. Girls: James Caviezel has his shirt off for half the movie. :) The fight scene at the end of the film was a little long and a bit predictable, but over all this is the best movie I've seen in a really long time."
4,You didn't think I'd make it that easy?,"It's a long story about revenge. He gets sent to jail. Evently he escapes and finds the treasure of Spira. Wealth is not enough for this man, he had to get his revenge and that's when this story gets interesting. Nepolien is in it to."
1,Hilarious,"While I was watching this movie, I couldn't believe how funny it was. It was absolutely HILARIOUS. Towards the end, I was openely laughing outloud, very loudly. And it should also be said that I was in a theatre at the time.Honestly, it seemed like some sort of horrible parody gone wrong. Besides the title, the only other similarity I could distinguish between the movie and book was the name of the characters. Call me crazy, but I always thought that if you're going to make a movie BASED on a book, there shouldn't be a different story line.If you've never read the book, watch the movie. It's highly entertaining. If you have read the book, and want to see a classic example of how Hollywood butchers literary classics, then this is the thing for you. Or, if you want to get a cheap laugh out of it.For a better version of the movie, watch the (1980's was it?) Russian (er, Soviet) version, if you can get your hands on a translation."
3,"decent, but not even close","I watched this movie with great anticipation after reading the book however, I quickly realized that this is not the same story that Dumas put on paper all those many years ago. If you have never read his book it will entertain you. It was entertaining but again it was not even close to the book. It would be better titled ""Kinda like the Count...Cristo""."
3,another screw up,"At first the movie showed great promise that the hollywood would finally learn how to make good movies based on popular classics. However, it's another screw up. Sure, the action and adventure are top notch, but the story is completely off."
4,Suprisingly watchable film for everyone.,"Having not remembered this film when it was released, we did not know how long it would take before hitting the Stop button. This is actually a very good movie and okay for most of the family as well. Not having read the book, I assume it strays somewhat, however it is still worth seeing.No real language, no nudity, no extreme violence, good plot, great sound and great videography. The moral message is very good and very un-Hollywood as well, even when you abandon God, he will not abandon you."
4,"Good..But please don't call it ""Faithful""","I agree with most revievers who thought this was a very good movie...visually stunning, well acted, etc. What I take exception to are the comments to the effect that it is faithful to the book. Having just finished the book myself, I was interested to see the movie. The departures from the original story appeared immediately and continued throughout the movie up to and including the ending. Some were no doubt taken to condense the story to a managable length. Some were apparently intended to add more action (and a little sex) to appeal to today's audiences who are accoustomed to this (we must be sensitive to those who lose intrest if there hasn't been sex or violence in the last 5 munutes after all). I'm not saying that the changes where wrong, and they may even have made this a better movie (I actually prefered this ending to the one in the book for instance). But, PLEASE DON'T CALL IT FAITHFUL to the book."
2,If it Ain't Broke.........,Alexandre Dumas was a fantastic author. The novel he wrote of The Count of Monte Cristo is gripping and fantastic. I have read this book several times and it is exciting each time. The movie unexpectedly changes the book's intent from the point of the Count arriving in Paris. The changes are not necessary to meet time constraints and change the entire persona of the count. Yet another example of Hollywood screwing up great literature.Films can be made that adhere to the intent of great literature while making needed changes -- the Lord of the Rings movies are all great examples of this.
2,A very weak adaption of the novel,"Sadly to say, this film is a barebone, cheesy adaption of Duma's original epic. The original novel was excellent, it had taken the Count of Cristo decades to plot and carry out his revenge bit by bit. It was sweet revenge at its ultimate; his enemies were slowly tourmented in a cat & mouse sort of game. However in this movie, events fly by so fast that the entire story seems to happen over night. Most key characters were either deleted or under developed, and large chucks of the main story lines were cutted. These two reasons had made the Count's revenge very unsatisfying, as such it's my opinion that they had ruined a great story."
1,A disappointment for book fans,"If you read and loved the book, then most likely this movie isn't for you. The only similarities between the two being Dantes imprisonment and escape. I have yet to see a movie version of the Count of Monte Cristo that gets the story right, the closest being the 1975 Richard Chamberlain version, but even that one had it's flaws. A summery of this movie would be Edmond Dantes' life is ruined by his greedy friend, but after tweleve years in prison, Dantes comes back, gets his vengence, and Mercedes and his life goes back to how it was twelve years ago. The book is so much deeper, and this unrealistic fairy tale ending makes the whole movie feel flat."
5,Love this Movie,This is a great if somewhat inaccurate rendition of the book by Alexander Dumas. The disc arrived in the condition described and very quickly. I am happy.
3,"Good, but not the definitive version","This version ofThe Count of Monte Cristois pretty decent, for a Hollywoodized version of the classic novel. If you haven't read the novel, it's pretty exciting and keeps some of the novel's drama and suspense. James Caviezel and Guy Pearce both do great jobs portraying Counts Monte Cristo and Mondego. Some of the dialogue seems forced, especially when compared to the intricacy of the novel. This Hollywood version also has a lot more fight scenes to appeal to American audiences.However, I think the Gerard DepardieuThe Count of Monte Cristois much better. First of all, it's much longer (400 minutes), which allows the revenge plot to really thicken. Second, the Depardieu version stays more faithful to the novel. If you really want to watch a film adaptation of the novel, and have the time for it, I recommend the Depardieu instead of this one."
5,first time buyer,item ordered was in excellent condition and sent within time specified.Very satisfied
2,well this has almost nothing to do with the novel,"Unfortunately I have read the 1400 page novel and seen the movie versions starring robert donat and gerard depardieu. hence this version is a trivial adventure flick, with nothing at all of the magic of the classic.this might serve as an entertaining movie to a modern viewer with no idea what the real novel has to offer. this is less faithful, hence less sophisticated, even than the classic comic book version."
3,A benign feel-gooder for American audiences,"In spite of the flogging scenes, the movie is benign enough for young children to watch. It's passable entertainment for those who do not demand plot accuracy. The movie is indended for Americans who have not read the book. Snobbish French people would wince at the sound of the names butchered. Even I couldn't help chuckling at the fact that all signs in Paris were written in English."
3,Countless remake,"Workmanlike production, neither embarrssing nor engrossing. As always, the Dumas tale is enthralling, which is perhaps why this story has been made and remade over the decades. Judging the movie and not the Dumas plot, however, this production is lacking. The cast members look their parts and blend well with the superior costume and set direction, but their performances feel hasty and unrewarding. The production often looks as if it were filmed for TV and fails to evoke the potential drama. Even the sword duels seem strangely uninventive and thrown together, particularly when one considers that this film comes 30 years after Richard Lester's ""Three Musketeers."" If you enjoyed this version of the Count, take a look at any of the many others that have come before for comparison."
3,Count of Monte Cristo- counts ok in my book,"This is a good version. However, I prefer the version with Richard Chamberlin. I found the Chamberlin version much more engaging."
5,Fantastic movie!! Jim Caviezel was incredible!,Fantastic movie!! Jim Caviezel was incredible!The storyline is incredible and so was the entire cast. I highly recommend this movie. Two enthusiastic thumbs up!
5,Great movie,"The storyline was based on the Alexander Dumas book. Loved the movie the whole way through. Makes sure the kiddos are in bed, there is violence. Very pleased ordering through our ps3. Only ""buffered?"" One time during the film, otherwise, looked like blu ray quality"
1,Tranfer problems,At certain points in the movie the picture will shade out...particularly when Edmond is speaking with Nepoleon. The company putting these flawed discs out should be shot... There is no quality control at the company making these disc transfers. I wonder if they even view it before it goes to the shelf. This is not the only blu ray I've purchased with this problem. Keep your regular formatted dvd disc. I wish I did!
1,"a moviegoer in los angeles, Ca","Although the acting is good, and the movie is full of action, it is the worst adaptation of a novel that I have ever seen. I read the book many times as a teen and adult and loved it, but this movie, with its made up characters,and plot ,would make 'Alexander Dumas' turn in his grave."
1,count of Monte cristo,It finally arrived after waiting over a month....it was sent with no protective wrapping of any kind and was damaged...as was the case it arrived in...I was very disatisfied and not pleased...from now on I will only order strictly from amazon.
1,wrong version,this came as PAL format and I can't play it in the united states (nstc) I think not sure but the one that is for America
5,Watched Many Times,I have watched this movie numerous times. I have always enjoyed the overall theme of this movie. I will probably watch it again.
5,Great movie based on a great book!,"This is a very complex book that encompasses many years. The movie did a very good job of keying in on the events that allows someone who never read the book to understand the characters, situation and message. One of mine and my husband's favorites (book and movie).Laura in Texas"
5,Monte Cristo,"Amazing movie. Jim Carviezel is a heck of an actor. Much better than previous, older versions of Monte Cristo. The best. Equally good as the book, which is more than can be said about lots of movies which are usually a huge departure from books. Great one to own and see again and again."
4,disk good delivery long,"the disk of the dvd i bought was in good condition but i waited quite a while for it to get to me, so that is my only complaint with this purchase"
5,Unexpected,"I have just come from seeing this movie in the theatre as a favor to my husband (who read the book). I have to say that it was much better than I had expected it to be. Most people who have seen other remakes and have read the book didn't enjoy it as much as I did. My husband read the book many years ago, and he liked the movie. If you watch the movie without expectations, I think you will really enjoy it. I know that as soon as it comes out on DVD our family will be buying it."
5,More satisfying for an old man.,"I found this version more satifyling than the one with Richard Chamberline. Although the Caviezel version does not follow the book, the ""boy getting the girl"" in the end offers more satisfaction"
1,This DVD SKIPPED FREQUENTLY,"I opened this ""new"" DVD and it skipped every 20 to 30 seconds throughout the entire movie. I would not recommend buying a DVD from this seller, as it may not work properly."
3,"a wrong casting job, further ruined by a lame screenplay","this is in general a very bland movie with inappropriate castings, further ruined by a lame screenplay. scenes and settings are all okay but all the major roles simply failed to deliver an in-depth viewing feelings. the make-up jobs for all the casts were also terrible. after 15 years (based on the age of dantes' son) gone by, nobody seemed to change a bit, but nobody seemed to recognize nobody, that's ridiculous. the ending also sucks. adapted from this great novel that i've read and re-read three times, this was perhaps the worst one transcribed from the novel. what a waste of great settings and costumes. we simply failed to feel anything emotional during the watch."
1,The Count of Monte Cristo,"For those of you who have read the book (abridged or unabridged), be prepared to be dissapointed! The only similarity that the movie and the book share is the name itself. It is a travesty that somebody can re-write a classic literary work into something like a made-for-tv movie! Check that...there is a made-for-tv series in French (made by Bravo, I believe) that is the closest depiction of The Count of Monte Cristo that I have ever seen. I would not waste my time watching thismovie! See the bravo flick...not this one!"
